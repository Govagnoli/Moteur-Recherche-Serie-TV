Previously on "desperate housewives"...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Grandma's here.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,100
In life...

4
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,100
It's a post-nuptial agreement.

5
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,400
I'm not signing this.

6
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,500
Aah!

7
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,800
Sign it!

8
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,800
Stop! You're hurting me!

9
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,500
Mrs. Solis, what are you doing here?

10
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,200
You can't change what's already been done.

11
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,100
People leave trails.

12
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,100
One of those trails will lead to Deirdre.

13
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,800
I'm not taking my money to the grave.

14
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
I'm going to use it to save your ass.

15
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,900
Or who people really are.

16
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,300
Andrew just told me he thinks he might be gay.

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,200
Every morning as she went to take out her trash,

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:45,500
Lynette Scavo would indulge in a little daydream,
the details of which were always the same.

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:53,400
One day her nasty neighbor Karen Mccluskey
would keel over and die,

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:01,100
and her home would be bought by a lovely
Swedish family with two adorable twin daughters.

21
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,400
The families would for man everlasting friendship,

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,300
culminating in their daughters marrying her sons
at an elaborate wedding

23
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:16,100
the Scavos wouldn't have to pay for.

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,100
Yes, Lynette enjoyed her little daydream,

25
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:27,100
but Mrs. Mccluskey always had a way
of pulling her back to reality.

26
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,900
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

27
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,300
Why are you stealing my garbage cans?

28
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,600
Garbage pickup was two days ago, and
these cans have been on the street ever since.

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,500
I just assumed you didn't want them anymore.

30
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,800
Oh, that's very cute.
That's good.

31
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,200
Here. Give them here.

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,100
It's bad enough we got to look at that
god-awful color you painted the house.

33
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,200
We shouldn't have to stare at
your cans for days on end.

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,800
You want to talk about good neighbor etiquette?

35
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,500
How about you hire a gardener
to take care of that jungle you call a lawn?

36
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,200
I am on a fixed income.

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,700
Oh. Well, perhaps you should consider
moving somewhere less expensive,

38
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,000
like a nursing home.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
- Go to hell.
- Run by Germans, hmm?

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,500
And you know --

41
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,600
Oh. Oh.

42
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,000
Mrs. -- Mrs. Mccluskey.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,500
Mrs. Mccluskey, are you all right?

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,200
I'll get the door.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,900
Mrs. Mccluskey.

46
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,800
For a brief moment, Lynette was presented
with an interesting choice of options.

47
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,600
And though she knew she'd hate
herself in the morning,

48
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,400
Lynette chose to do the right thing.

49
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Lynette, where are they taking me?

50
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,100
You're going to the hospital, Mrs. Mccluskey.
You're going to be fine.

51
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,600
I don't want to go alone.
Come with me.

52
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:49,300
Oh, um, these are trained technicians,
and I've got a roast in the... freezer.

53
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,900
Please. I'm scared.

54
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,100
Yeah, I'll come with you.

55
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay, here I am. Thank you.

56
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,000
If I die, I don't want it to be with strangers.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,800
You're not going to die.

58
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,500
How can you be so sure?

59
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,900
Of course, Lynette didn't respond.

60
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:20,000
How could she tell her neighbor that some dreams
were just too beautiful to come true?

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,000
<font color=F62B97>Episode 19 : Live Alone and Like It
(a.k.a. An Unexpected Song)

62
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,800
Life is a journey,

63
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,900
one that is much better traveled
with a companion by our side.

64
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,700
But sometimes we lose
our companions along the way,

65
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,200
and then the journey becomes unbearable.

66
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,100
Noah.

67
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,100
Didn't know you were a religious man.

68
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,600
What's with the rosary?

69
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
They found Dierdre.

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,600
What?

71
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,700
Her body had been stuffed inside a toy chest.

72
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,600
Can you believe that?

73
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,000
A kid's toy chest.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,400
She'd been dismembered.

75
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,400
Oh, my god.

76
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,100
Cops I.D.'D her from her dental records.

77
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,600
She's been dead 15 years.

78
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,100
All that time I was looking for her,

79
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,100
she was already gone.

80
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,100
I'm so sorry.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,800
I have to bury my baby.

82
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,100
I came out here to,

83
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,500
Uh... figure out what kind of
Tombstone to get her.

84
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,300
You shouldn't be doing this now.

85
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,300
Let's get you home.

86
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,200
There's a cop I want you to talk to.

87
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,000
A cop?

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,100
His name is Sullivan.

89
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,700
I paid him to take the heat off you
for your neighbor's murder.

90
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,800
He'll get you the file on Dierdre's case.

91
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,200
Apparently, they have some leads.

92
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,500
I don't know.
I think we may be making a huge mistake.

93
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,700
We made our decision.
Let's just stick to it.

94
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,300
Let's say we leave him here three more weeks.

95
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,700
What's the worst that could happen?

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Our son just told us that he might be gay.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,400
There are 200 other boys in this camp.

98
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,000
Now, I could explain to you what might happen
if we left him here,

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,100
but I'm a lady,
and I don't use that kind of language.

100
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,200
You  know, I bet we're worrying
ourselves sick over nothing.

101
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,500
This is probably just a phase.

102
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,000
Exactly, so we'll get him home,

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
we'll get him into Christian counseling
so it won't become a lifestyle.

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,900
Well, whatever's going on with him,
he's still our son, and we love him.

105
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,700
Why would you say that to me?

106
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,200
Because it's obvious how freaked out you are
by the whole gay thing.

107
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,200
I may be freaked out,
but that doesn't change how I feel about him.

108
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm just saying be cool.

109
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
I can be just as cool as you can.

110
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,100
All  right.

111
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,000
It'll be nice to have you back.

112
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Andrew...

113
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,200
I would love you even if you were a murderer.

114
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,700
Mommy, the line's not moving.

115
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,400
Oh, for pete's sake.

116
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,000
Mom. Mom.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,200
- What?
- Kids are waiting.

118
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,800
Oh, honey, hector here teaches salsa dancing
at the community center.

119
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,500
I give private lessons, too.

120
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,800
Oh, I bet you do.

121
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
- Mom.
- What?

122
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,200
Could you please not flirt
with the ice cream man?

123
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Why not?

124
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,700
Do you need a reason beyond the fact
that he's the ice cream man?

125
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,200
It's called moving on with your life.

126
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,800
You just broke up
with Morty two weeks ago.

127
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,100
Don't you think you can at least pretend
to mourn the relationship?

128
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,200
Oh, you are such a stick in the mud.

129
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,200
We should be out there having fun.

130
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,100
I know what we can do tonight.

131
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,700
We can go to some hip club
and get some hot guys.

132
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,100
- Mom --
- oh, it'll be great.

133
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,900
I'll say I'm 42, and you can be 28.

134
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,100
What?

135
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,600
Oh, you can pull it off.

136
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,800
Mrs. Mccluskey, you're back
from the hospital already?

137
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,100
Turns out I O.D.'D a little bit
on my arthritis medication.

138
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,600
One pill, I can open a jar.
Four pills, I'm face-down crawling for my life.

139
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,400
You'll find out about that soon enough.

140
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,500
Well, I'm glad to hear you're all right.

141
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,600
Here.

142
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,800
My way of saying thank you
for not letting me die out there on the lawn.

143
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,700
- Oh, Mrs. Mccluskey, you don't --
- keep that.

144
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,800
It's genuine tiffany.

145
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,700
It's been in my family for years.

146
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,400
I don't know what to say.

147
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,200
It's -- it's stunning. Thank you.

148
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,800
I'd invite you in, but --

149
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,500
well, I wanted to tell you what my doctor said.

150
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,800
Seems that arthritis is the least of my problems.

151
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,700
See, I had this skin tag --
or what I thought was a skin tag,

152
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,000
but it turns out it might be more serious.

153
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,600
What do you think you're doing?

154
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,800
Please -- I can't sleep in the den anymore.
I need to sleep in a bed.

155
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,700
Well, then, you might want to try a motel,
because you're not coming back in here.

156
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
How many times have I got to say I'm sorry?

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,900
Obviously, a few more.

158
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,100
I am not proud of what I did.

159
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,200
I admit, I was way out of line.

160
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,300
You want back in this bed?

161
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,500
You know what to do.

162
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,400
I'm not tearing up the post-nup.

163
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Why not?

164
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,500
Because it's the one way that I can ensure
you'll be here when I get out of jail.

165
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,100
Well, then have fun at the motel.

166
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,500
Fine.

167
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,600
Tomorrow I'm canceling your credit cards.

168
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,300
What?

169
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,700
And I'm taking away your ATM as well.

170
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,500
What am I supposed to do for money?

171
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,800
Maybe once you see
how good you've got it here,

172
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,500
you'll start treating me with a little respect.

173
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,500
You want my respect?
Then tear up the post-nup.

174
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,300
Give me my pillow.

175
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,700
One more thing --

176
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,800
if you ever hurt me again,
I will kill you.

177
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,200
If you ever leave me for another man,
I'll kill you.

178
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,100
Boy, with all this passion,
isn't it a shame that we're not having sex?

179
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,600
I feel trapped.

180
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,300
You want me to open a window?

181
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,100
No, I'm talking about my life.

182
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,200
Oh.

183
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,300
Are we done making out?

184
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,100
No, no. Keep going.

185
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,600
So what's up?

186
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,300
I'm unhappy with Carlos and my marriage.

187
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,300
I feel like I don't have options,
and it's driving me crazy.

188
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,700
Every time something went south in my life,
I always had a plan "B."

189
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,300
Now I feel like I have nothing.

190
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,800
What about me?
Can't I be your plan "B"?

191
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,900
Damn it, John,
what is our new rule?

192
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,900
Stop pretending we have a future.

193
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,700
Thank you.

194
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,100
Can't you just walk out?

195
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,600
No, 'cause if I leave, then I'll be broke,
and that's awful.

196
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
If I stay, then he's in control,
and that's horrifying.

197
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,400
And he cut up all my credit cards,
which means I'm married to him and unable to shop,

198
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,500
which is probably the worst of all possible worlds.

199
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,100
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,800
I'll  figure something out.

201
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,400
I'm not much fun today.

202
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,200
I'm going to go.

203
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,400
Wait.

204
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
What's this?

205
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,500
You deserve nice things,
and if Mr. Solis won't provide them, I will.

206
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,000
With your student credit card?

207
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,300
I own my own business.

208
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,400
You mow lawns.

209
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
I make good money.

210
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,000
You know, I have 20 houses, and I'm this close
to getting the driving range at the country club.

211
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,600
I can't.

212
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,500
Yes, you can.

213
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,800
I'll pay it off.

214
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,300
If you want.

215
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,300
But you don't have to.

216
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,700
Mrs. Solis...
to take care of you --

217
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,100
it's my dream.

218
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,100
Well, far be it from me to stand
in the way of a young man's dream.

219
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Okay, Tom, yeah.
I will swing by the dry cleaners after I hit the market.

220
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,600
Mm, I don't know.
Porter has a dentist appointment at 4:00,

221
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,100
so the, um, car might have to wait until Tomorrow.

222
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,400
Okay, yeah. I love you, too. Bye-bye.

223
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,300
Hi there.

224
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,100
I brought you some avocados.

225
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,500
I have a tree in back, but I hate them,

226
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,600
and your family seems like the kind
that would eat guacamole.

227
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,200
Um, Mrs. Mccluskey, thank you.
That is very nice.

228
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,300
So let's make up a batch.

229
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,900
Oh, um, now's not a good time.

230
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,400
I'm on my way out.
I have a ton of errands.

231
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,200
Oh, that's great, because my car's on the Fritz,
and I could hitch a ride.

232
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,800
I need to drop by the pharmacy anyway.

233
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,800
No, I can't. I'm sorry,
but I-I have a lot of things to do.

234
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,400
Maybe you could take me later.
I could drop by Tomorrow.

235
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,100
Mrs. Mccluskey, I'm not going to
have any time Tomorrow.

236
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,600
Oh. Kind of interesting that
you can't spend two minutes with me,

237
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,000
but you have no trouble taking my tiffany lamp.

238
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,700
Oh, for god's sakes.

239
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,700
Here.

240
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,100
You should take this back.

241
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,200
I-I don't have a place for it.

242
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,600
But that was my thank you for saving my life.

243
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,700
I know, and it was a beautiful gesture.
Really.

244
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,100
But I just --

245
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,900
Save it, Lynette.
I get the picture.

246
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,600
Oh!

247
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh, god.

248
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,500
Susie, this is Tim.

249
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,800
Sorry we startled you.

250
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Oh, uh, that's okay. I --

251
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,500
I just didn't expect to see
anybody up at a quarter to 1:00.

252
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Oh, Susie, you should have come out tonight.

253
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,700
I met Tim here at the islands bar,

254
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:54,500
and he introduced me to this crazy drink --
the dirty volcano.

255
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,500
Whoo.

256
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,800
And then we danced,
and he dipped me.

257
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,700
Sophie's very limber.

258
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,800
Uh, mom, could I just talk to you
in the family room for a minute?

259
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,800
Oh, sure.

260
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,200
Susan is your daughter?

261
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,300
Ha ha. Yeah.

262
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,100
No, she can't be.

263
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,400
Yes.

264
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,300
- No.
- Yeah.

265
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,500
- No.
- Yeah.

266
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
- No.
- Yes.

267
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,900
Okay, we get it.
She looks young.

268
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,100
That man has magic fingers.

269
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,200
What are you doing?
I have a teenage daughter in the house.

270
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,200
You can't just bring strange men
you meet in bars here in the middle of the night.

271
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,000
We're just having a few laughs.
What's the big deal?

272
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,800
I know you're trying to get over Morty,
but this is not the way to do it,

273
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,800
So can you please just go out there
and tell him to go home?

274
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,700
You know how blue I've been.

275
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,100
Why can't you be supportive?

276
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
I have been plenty supportive.

277
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,500
No, you haven't.
You really haven't.

278
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,900
Now, Tim is my guest,
and he will go home when I say so.

279
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
If he's not gone in five minutes,

280
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,400
I'm going to go out there and tell him
exactly how old you really are.

281
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,100
Tim, it's time for me to go sleepy-bye.

282
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,900
Delfino.

283
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah.

284
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,900
You must be Sullivan.

285
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,700
The file on Noah's daughter.

286
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,700
Yeah, he said you had some leads.

287
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,100
Yeah, sure, we got some leads.

288
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,900
Is there a problem?

289
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,700
Gee, I don't know.

290
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:51,300
I'm handing a confidential police report
over to a killer and drug dealer.

291
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,400
Why should that be a problem?

292
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,300
Thanks.

293
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Is this what our justice system has come to --

294
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,500
guys like you walking the streets
without a care in the world?

295
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,100
I did my time.

296
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,600
Not nearly enough,
you piece of garbage.

297
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,800
You know, I'm glad we had the chance to meet,

298
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,400
because apparently, I'm no longer
a murder suspect thanks to you,

299
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,800
so I don't want to seem ungrateful.

300
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,500
But  just out of curiosity --

301
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,700
how much does it cost to buy off
a homicide detective these days?

302
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,000
Thanks again.

303
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,100
Hey, Delfino... one more thing.

304
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:05,000
Now, this file is misplaced.
Understand?

305
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,200
If even a whisper of this gets traced back to me,

306
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,900
there will be one less cop killer on the street.

307
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,500
And for god's sakes...
don't get any blood on the file.

308
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,100
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
but your credit card has been declined.

309
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,000
What?

310
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,700
Oh, no, that's impossible.
It's a new card.

311
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,500
I just went shopping with it.

312
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,600
Try it again.

313
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,800
Ma'am, I ran it three times,
and then I called the bank.

314
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,900
Now, may I try another card?

315
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,500
Of course you may.
Will you just give me a moment?

316
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,000
- Hello?
- It's me.

317
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,200
I've been trying to call you,
but you turned your cell off.

318
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,300
Because I'm in a lovely restaurant
having a lovely meal that I now can't pay for.

319
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,600
Well, did you order already?

320
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,700
I ate already.

321
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,100
Look, the credit card company called my mom.

322
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,800
I mean, they said that there was
unusual activity on my card.

323
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
- I bought shoes.
- Well, I didn't know that.

324
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
And then my mom started asking all these questions,

325
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,300
so I just blurted out that the card was stolen,
and she canceled it.

326
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,800
Why would they call your parents?
It's your account.

327
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,700
They co-signed for it.

328
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,600
Look, if you just explain to the waiter --

329
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,100
What, that the credit card
was canceled by my lover's mommy?

330
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,000
Well, what other options do you have?

331
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,100
Unless you return the shoes
and get the money back.

332
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,600
Return the shoes?

333
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,700
I can't talk to you
when you're being hysterical.

334
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,100
So, ma'am, what would you
like to do about the bill?

335
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,300
Afternoon. I've got a package
for your neighbor Karen Mccluskey.

336
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,400
You mind signing?

337
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,200
Well, isn't she home?
She usually never goes anywhere.

338
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,100
No one answered.

339
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,100
All right.

340
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,100
Okay.
Thank you.

341
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,600
So let me get this straight --

342
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,300
You play tennis, you know wine,
and you speak mandarin.

343
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,500
Does every other man
in the world want you dead?

344
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,800
Well, I'm not that impressive.

345
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,200
I pulled a gray hair
out of my chest this morning.

346
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,000
I don't know. I'd watch your back.

347
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,100
You know, I've really
enjoyed talking to you.

348
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,400
You, uh...

349
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,600
Well, you made my day.

350
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,600
I was thinking if you'd like
to get together again...

351
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,700
Well, Sam, to --to tell you the truth,
I'm kind of in a relationship right now.

352
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,800
I just wanted to be honest.

353
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,500
That's perfectly okay, Tina.

354
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,800
By the way...
this is on me.

355
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,200
Oh, no, you shouldn't.

356
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,100
Oh, please.
It's my pleasure.

357
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,900
This is going to be a disaster.

358
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,300
It'll be fine.

359
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,400
Andrew, honey, hurry up.
Dinner's ready.

360
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,900
It's like we're setting a trap for him.

361
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,300
It's for his own good.
You'll see.

362
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,400
Smells good.
What are we having?

363
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,900
I'm making homemade bratwurst
with sweet-and-sour cabbage.

364
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,000
It's a recipe I found in
an old German cookbook.

365
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,800
I'll get the door.
Honey, why don't you pour the wine?

366
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
Isn't Danielle spending the night at Wendy's?

367
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,400
I believe she is.

368
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,000
Well, then why did mom set the table
for four places?

369
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Huh?

370
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,200
Uh, I asked who's coming for dinner.

371
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,300
Andrew...
you remember Reverend Sikes, don't you?

372
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,000
Oh, come on.

373
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,900
Um, Reverend, why don't you have a seat,
and I will get some refreshments?

374
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,300
So, Andrew...
it's been a long time.

375
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,100
Yes.
Yes, it has.

376
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,500
Would you like some water?
I have flat or bubbly.

377
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,600
Oh, bubbly, please.

378
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,000
So...

379
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
your mother tells me you've started having
some sexual desires for other boys.

380
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,800
I don't suppose I could get some of that.

381
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,500
Nope.
I'm going to need every drop.

382
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:14,000
And over the years, we've had so many
young people come to our ministry

383
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,300
hating themselves for their unnatural desires,
and within a few months,

384
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:23,000
they've found an inner peace and
a tranquility that is nothing short of miraculous.

385
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,100
Oh.

386
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,500
And all it takes is a little faith
and a desire to change.

387
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,100
I'm sorry,
but I-I really don't want to talk about my sex life.

388
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,100
Well, that's just too bad,
because this needs to be discussed.

389
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,700
Bree, please, let the boy speak.
Go on.

390
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,100
Well, I appreciate your offer to help.
I do.

391
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,400
But I don't hate myself.

392
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,100
So I'm good.

393
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,200
Son, I know what it's like to be a teenager.
It's a very confusing time.

394
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,400
I'm not confused.

395
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,600
I know exactly who I am.

396
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:10,500
Well... if you ever do want to talk,
my door is always open.

397
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,000
Reverend, I don't mean to criticize, but...

398
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,600
it sounds like you're giving up.

399
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,100
We can't force him on the path of righteousness.

400
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,600
He himself has got to
want to make the journey.

401
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,800
Well, then, what do we do,
just stand by while he starts dating boys?

402
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,800
And by the way, the correct word is not "gay."
It's "sodomy."

403
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,200
- We're in the middle of dinner.
- So?

404
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,600
So can you at least wait till dessert
before calling our sona sodomite?

405
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,000
How you can sit there
and be so casual is beyond me.

406
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,600
For starters, I knew this dinner was a bad idea
the moment you suggested it.

407
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,100
Well, at least I'm trying to be proactive.

408
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,400
Please, there's no need to get upset.

409
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,800
I am upset because there is a problem here,
and no one seems to notice it but me.

410
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,200
As far as I'm concerned,

411
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,500
if Andrew is happy with who he is,
then it is our job to support him.

412
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,200
Your father is into S&M.

413
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,200
Bree.

414
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,500
He makes me beat him with a riding crop,
and I let him.

415
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,300
It's no wonder you're perverted.

416
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,000
Look who your parents are.

417
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,500
Excuse me.

418
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,100
What a fun night.

419
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,300
You know, we should really do
this again sometime.

420
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,100
Hey.

421
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,600
Hey -- good news.

422
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,800
I know why you've been so furious at me.

423
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,000
I haven't been furious at you.

424
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Oh, well, yes, you have,
and I don't blame you.

425
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,400
Men have been coming on to me left and right,

426
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,800
and I just -- I've been having so much fun
and just enjoying life, and --

427
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,400
what do I do?
I throw it right in your face.

428
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,500
I'd hate me, too.

429
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Mom, I don't hate you.

430
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,900
Well, be that as it may,
from here on out,

431
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,900
I'm including you in all the fun.

432
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,200
- The fun?
- Mm-hmm.

433
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,800
Your mother's come through.

434
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,900
What have you done?

435
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,100
You and I are going on a double date tonight.

436
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,800
What?

437
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Tim has a friend from the box factory,

438
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,600
and I thought the four of us could hang out,
have a few drinks, some hors d'oeuvres, and --

439
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,400
forget it.

440
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,300
Well, Susie --

441
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,800
Mom, I'm sorry.
I'm just not in the mood to hang out these days.

442
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,100
Susie, sweetie, please, I can't cancel now.

443
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,000
Of course you can.

444
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,500
Just call them up and tell them not to come over.

445
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,000
Tim.

446
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,600
Hi, Susie.
This is --this is my buddy Lamont.

447
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,300
I brought peppermint schnapps.

448
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,200
I'm sure she's fine.

449
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,200
She never leaves her mail sitting out there.

450
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,500
I mean, how many times has she thrown ours away
because we didn't pick it up the second it came?

451
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,100
That would be five.

452
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,000
I don't know, Tom.
I think something's happened to her.

453
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,700
Okay, so go overhand check on her.

454
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:26,700
But if I'm wrong, then I'm sucked
into a 2-hour conversation about bunions.

455
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,000
Don't go check on her.

456
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Six months from now,

457
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
when they find her mummified corpse
at the bottom of the basement stairs,

458
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
What do I tell the kids?

459
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,200
"Oh, yeah, I let Mrs. Mccluskey die."

460
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,700
Yeah, and why would they care?

461
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,700
Like they're going to miss the dry cleaning coupons
she hands out on Halloween.

462
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,000
Tom.

463
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,200
Listen, honey, what can I say?

464
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,600
You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't,
so, uh, good luck with that.

465
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,900
Honey, I'm hating you a little bit right now.

466
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,300
Hi, honey. Look at my new shoes.

467
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,200
Yeah.

468
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,400
Aren't they gorgeous?

469
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,200
Honey, I'm trying to watch the game.

470
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,400
Sorry.

471
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,600
How'd you buy new shoes?

472
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,400
Shh. Talk later. You're watching the game.

473
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,200
No, I want to talk about it now.

474
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,900
You don't have any money,
so what's the story?

475
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,600
Oh, you've heard it before.

476
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,900
Girl meets boy, boy buys girl things,
girl leaves happy.

477
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,000
What did you do?

478
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You know, I forgot how generous men could be.

479
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,400
I also forgot I have options -- a whole bunch of them.

480
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
What the hell are you talking about?

481
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,700
I don't need your credit cards, Carlos,
and I don't need your money,

482
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,100
but if our marriage is going to work,
I need your respect.

483
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,700
I'm not ripping up the post-nup.

484
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,800
Yes, you are.

485
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:52,100
Because if you don't, I'm going to put on
my new shoes and walk out the door.

486
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
You're threatening me.

487
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,800
No, I'm just pointing something out.

488
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,600
I'm a pretty girl, and pretty girls are never lonely.

489
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,900
Stop -- I'm really ticklish.

490
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,800
So, uh, children's books, right?

491
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,200
Don't! That tickles!

492
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,500
Well, I hope you know how lucky you are.

493
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,200
Not everyone gets to realize their bliss.

494
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,300
Yeah, it can be rewarding.

495
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,700
Why don't you join me?

496
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,500
No.

497
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,900
I'm really ticklish.

498
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,600
Come on!

499
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,000
What's wrong?

500
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,700
For god's sake, Tim, she's ticklish!

501
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,700
How many times do you have to be told?

502
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,100
Oh, plfft. This is so much fun.

503
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,400
Come on, let's find another CD.

504
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Mother, don't you think it's getting a little late?

505
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,300
Come on.

506
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,200
You haven't even finished your schnapps.

507
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,400
The perfect capper to the perfect evening.

508
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,000
So good night.

509
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,900
It's been lovely, and, Lamont,
good luck with all your inventions.

510
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,500
Well, it's only 11:30.

511
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,700
I want to hit the clubs.

512
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,000
Well, I know a great place just off the interstate.
Come on.

513
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,100
Let's warm up the old war wagon.

514
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,300
Mom, hold it!

515
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,400
You are not getting into
the car alone with those two.

516
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,500
You barely know them.

517
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,200
I have great instincts about people.

518
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,300
I always have, Susie. You know that.

519
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,600
You've been married four times.

520
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,300
Yes, but twice to the same guy.

521
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,500
Mother.

522
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,500
Susie, please, you are embarrassing me.

523
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,300
Oh, I'm embarrassing you?

524
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,600
Yes, and I've had it.

525
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,300
All night long,
I've been trying to get you to stop being so crabby,

526
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,900
and you refuse to let me help.

527
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,900
And -- and your idea of helping
is letting Tim just grope you?

528
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,200
Hey! You shouldn't talk to your mother like that.
She's a fine lady.

529
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,000
Tim, could you just stay out of it?

530
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,300
Yeah, mind your own business.

531
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,400
Hey, what's your problem, pal?

532
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,100
Dude, you were feeling up her mother.
It pissed me off, too.

533
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,300
Come on, Susie.
Let's go back inside.

534
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,400
"Let's go back inside"?
Lamont, give it up.

535
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,100
You're not getting any.

536
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,600
Why are you being this way?

537
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,200
Just -- I'm just trying to lighten things up.

538
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,300
Stop acting like tonight was about helping me.

539
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,000
You wanted to go out and have fun,
and Lamont over there needed a date.

540
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,600
- That's not true.
- Oh, yes, it is.

541
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,000
Okay, fine, it's true.

542
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,800
I wanted to get out and have fun.
Why shouldn't I?

543
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,500
You know how depressed I've been
over my breakup with Morty.

544
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,100
Yeah, I do,
and that's what makes me so crazy.

545
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,700
You know, the difference between you and I --

546
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,800
that you could be heartbroken
and you can just move on,

547
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,800
and I...
am just broken.

548
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,300
I know you're sad.

549
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,600
No, mom, I'm not sad.

550
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,100
And I'm not crabby.

551
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,000
I'm devastated,

552
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,300
and you keep acting
like all I need is a couple of aspirin.

553
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:21,800
Morty was just one guy
in a series of guys for you.

554
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,300
And Mike...

555
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,000
he was the one.

556
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,100
Why don't you get that?

557
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,600
It's Lynette.

558
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,000
Hello?

559
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,000
Mrs. Mccluskey?

560
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,300
Mrs. Mccluskey. You all right?

561
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,100
How did you get in here?

562
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,700
Uh, Mr. Mullinshad a spare.

563
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,100
Why didn't you open the door?

564
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,200
Because I was hoping that you'd go away.

565
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,100
Have you been taking your arthritis medication?

566
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,400
I don't need to.
Sometimes the pain goes away by itself.

567
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,000
Uh-huh.

568
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,200
Is that why you didn't open the door,
because of your hands?

569
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,000
Mrs. Mccluskey, do you have anyone
that could help you out -- a relative, a friend?

570
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,500
I'm fine.

571
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,200
Okay.

572
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,700
Okay.

573
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,400
Uh... before you go... open these, would you?

574
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,200
And -- and put out the pills.

575
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,200
Yeah.

576
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,300
And don't get your hands all over them.

577
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,000
God knows what your kids have picked up.

578
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,900
Last thing I need's a case of pinkeye.

579
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,800
You're a piece of work.
You know that?

580
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,600
Well, this is crazy.
Why'd they give you childproof caps?

581
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,500
First thing Tomorrow, I'm taking you to the pharmacy,
and we'll get you new bottles.

582
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,100
Don't do me any favors.
You don't even like me.

583
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,400
I don't want you doing anything
because you feel obligated.

584
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,100
Let me tell you something.
Half of life is obligations.

585
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,300
You don't want to go to your husband's
company Christmas party, but you do.

586
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,200
You don't want to sell candy
so your kid's band can buy piccolos, but you do it.

587
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,300
You attend your third cousin's wedding.

588
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,800
You pick up the dry cleaning.
That's life --it's obligations.

589
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,400
And you are now my obligation,

590
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,000
so Tomorrow morning, I'll pick you up,
and we'll go to the pharmacy.

591
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,200
Gee, I'm touched
by your outpouring of compassion.

592
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,600
We don't have to be friends.

593
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,200
But we're two human beings
living on the same piece of earth.

594
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,300
We can at least try
and help each other out once in a while.

595
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,300
And you know what?

596
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,900
I am going to take this.

597
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,700
Fine.

598
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,500
I'll see you Tomorrow morning.

599
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,800
Pick me up at 9:00.

600
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,400
And don't be late.

601
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,000
Andrew, come here. I want you to see this.

602
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,200
Um, what are you looking at?

603
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,300
I'm looking at your baby pictures.

604
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,400
Look at that one.

605
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,200
How old was I there?

606
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,000
Just 4 weeks old.

607
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:39,900
I never told you this, but when I gave birth to you,
there were complications.

608
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,100
The umbilical cord wrapped around your neck,
and you stopped breathing.

609
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,800
The room got very quiet,
and I knew you were in trouble.

610
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,700
So I turned to the doctor, and I very calmly said
that he was not to worry about me,

611
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,400
that his job was to save your life.

612
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,600
When I say I would die for you,

613
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,600
that's not an expression.

614
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,800
I mean it.

615
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,600
Yeah, well, uh...

616
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,700
I'm going to go eat my sandwich.

617
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,400
Andrew, please,
just go and talk to Reverend Sikes.

618
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,300
Oh, for god's sakes --

619
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,400
he can counsel you. It can help.

620
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Mom, I don't need any help, all right?
I'm fine.

621
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,800
Why do you keep going on about this?

622
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,900
Because if you don't change who you are,
then you won't go to heaven.

623
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,700
You, um...

624
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,600
you -- you don't think I-I'll go to heaven?

625
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,300
No, I don't.

626
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,500
And I need you there.

627
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,600
I would be so lonely without you.

628
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,700
Well...
then I guess I better go talk to Reverend Sikes.

629
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,800
Oh, Andrew.

630
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,500
Thank you so much.
You don't know how much that means to me.

631
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,000
Oh, my -- my gosh.
Uh, are you okay?

632
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,400
Oh, yeah, I just, uh, fell down the stairs.
I'm fine.

633
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
What's up?

634
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,300
Susan still loves you.

635
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,300
Wow, um...
okay.

636
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,300
Look, this is not a good time
for this conversation.

637
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,600
She just misses you so much.

638
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,800
Sophie, I just found out
that someone I was very close to is dead.

639
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,600
I've really got to figure out
what I'm going to do,

640
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,600
so I just don't have time
to think about Susan right now.

641
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,700
She's just very, very unhappy,
and if you could just --

642
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,300
I really don't.

643
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm sorry.

644
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,300
PAUL YOUNG

645
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:30,200
I swear before almighty god
I won't reveal a word that's said here today.

646
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,600
Now...
what's on your mind?

647
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,700
Well, here's the thing --
I lied to my parents.

648
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,500
I'm not gay.

649
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,000
You're not.

650
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,600
Not really.

651
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,200
Look, all I know is
I wanted to get the hell out of that camp,

652
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,500
so I lied to my parents,

653
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,000
and I told them that I was really worried
that I was having feelings for other guys,

654
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,600
and...
they did exactly what I wanted them to.

655
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,200
They are such tools.

656
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,800
I'm sorry, just so I'm clear --

657
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,600
are you a heterosexual or aren't you?

658
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:12,500
Look... I love vanilla ice cream, okay?

659
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,700
But every now and then,
I'm probably going to be in the mood for chocolate.

660
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,600
You know what I'm saying?

661
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:26,000
I do, but god would prefer
you stick to the vanilla.

662
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,300
I don't believe in god.

663
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,700
You don't.

664
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,200
No.

665
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
Sorry.

666
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,000
You know, your mother's
going to be devastated.

667
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,800
She's been praying so hard for you to change.

668
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,100
Well, that's the good news.

669
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,800
I am going to change -- big time.

670
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,500
I-I'm not sure I follow.

671
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,000
You know what my mom said to me last night?

672
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,200
She said she doesn't think I'm going to heaven.

673
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,900
Can you believe that?

674
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,600
I'm sure she didn't mean to hurt your feelings,

675
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,700
but the only way you can know paradise
is by repenting your sins.

676
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,200
When she said that to me,

677
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,300
suddenly it hit me how I was going to get back at her.

678
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,900
From now on,
I'm going to be so good.

679
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,600
I'm going to eat my vegetables,

680
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,500
I-I'm going to get good grades,
I'm going to say "yes, ma'am"and "no, ma'am."

681
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:33,500
I'm going to make her believe
that god has delivered her this little miracle.

682
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,200
Until one day,
when she least expects it,

683
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:44,100
I'm going to do something so awful
it is going to rock her world.

684
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,500
I mean, it is really going to destroy her.

685
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,200
And when that day comes...

686
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,400
trust me.

687
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,800
I'll know paradise.

688
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,300
Yes, life is a journey,

689
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:18,200
one that is much better traveled with
a companion by our side.

690
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,400
Of course, that companion
can be just about anyone.

691
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,000
Mrs. Mccluskey!

692
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,000
We're going to be late for the doctor.

693
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,800
A neighbor on the other side of the street...

694
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,900
I'm coming. Jeez, hold your water.

695
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,400
There you go.

696
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,600
No more post-nup.

697
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,400
Or the man on the other side of the bed.

698
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,400
The companion can be a mother
with good intentions...

699
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,400
thank you for a wonderful service, Reverend.

700
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,000
Thank you so much, Bree.

701
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,300
Or a child who's up to no good.

702
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,300
Very inspirational.

703
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,900
Still, despite our best intentions,

704
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,500
some of us will lose our companions
along the way.

705
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,900
And then the journey becomes unbearable.

706
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,300
You see, human beings
are designed for many things,

707
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:33,900
but loneliness isn't one of them.
