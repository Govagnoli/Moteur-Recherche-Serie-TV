1
00:00:00,694 --> 00:00:02,694
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...

2
00:00:02,727 --> 00:00:06,890
Until the adoption is legally finalized,
the birth mother can still change her mind,

3
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:09,591
- and she has.
- Warrants were issued...

4
00:00:09,624 --> 00:00:12,357
- I'm going to fire Tom.
- If you just fire him, he'll sue you,

5
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:14,357
and I'll back him up.
You need cause.

6
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:17,224
- Well, I guess I'll have to find cause.
- Decisions were made...

7
00:00:17,257 --> 00:00:19,057
I'm going to do something
so awful,

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,790
it is going to rock her world.

9
00:00:21,823 --> 00:00:23,157
Threats were spoken...

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,658
So what the hell
are we gonna do?

11
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,959
And plans...

12
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:30,050
Phenobarbital?

13
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:32,751
It's time to give your brother
the peace he deserves.

14
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,424
...were put into action.

15
00:00:36,324 --> 00:00:38,790
The most
successful private investigator

16
00:00:38,823 --> 00:00:42,291
in Fairview
was a man named Oliver Weston.

17
00:00:42,324 --> 00:00:45,691
Try though he might,
Oliver couldn't remember

18
00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:49,257
the exact moment
he stopped believing in love.

19
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,624
Was it the night
he caught an executive

20
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:53,591
cheating with his secretary?

21
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:57,658
Or was it the day
he saw a housewife

22
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:59,823
cheating with her delivery boy?

23
00:01:01,957 --> 00:01:04,524
Or was it the time
he caught the girl next door

24
00:01:04,557 --> 00:01:08,090
cheating with the couple
who lived across the street?

25
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,857
Whenever the moment,

26
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,823
Oliver Weston
was now officially a cynic

27
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:18,491
who only believed in betrayal
and suspicion.

28
00:01:18,524 --> 00:01:21,391
Luckily for Oliver,
that's what paid his bills.

29
00:01:21,424 --> 00:01:24,491
Okay, you forgot fighting.

30
00:01:24,524 --> 00:01:26,557
What are you doing?

31
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:28,591
Oh. Sorry, man.
Are these your bushes?

32
00:01:28,624 --> 00:01:31,324
I'll clean that
all up when I'm done.

33
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:33,658
It'll be like
I was not here.

34
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:36,057
- You're done now.
- Whoa, easy, big fella.

35
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,157
I'm just a PI doing
a domestic surveillance job.

36
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,890
For who?

37
00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:41,724
The blonde lady
at the end of the street.

38
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:43,324
Edie Britt?

39
00:01:43,357 --> 00:01:44,957
Yeah. That's her fiancé.

40
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,357
Apparently, he dumped her
for another woman,

41
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:49,790
and I just figured out who.

42
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:52,190
Susan?
There's nothing going on there.

43
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:54,857
They used to be married.
She's only talking to him

44
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,890
- because they have a kid together.
- From what I heard, they're on their way to kid number two.

45
00:01:57,923 --> 00:02:01,324
- Well, you don't know what you're talking about.
- Yeah, and you don't know these soccer moms like I do.

46
00:02:01,357 --> 00:02:03,324
By day, they bake cookies
and carpool.

47
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:06,524
But dim the lights and bam...
they turn into total pigs.

48
00:02:08,057 --> 00:02:09,491
She's not like that.

49
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:11,291
Oh, please. Look at her.

50
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:14,591
That woman clearly knows
her way around a mattress.

51
00:02:17,823 --> 00:02:22,923
Yes, Oliver Weston
had become a cynic,

52
00:02:22,957 --> 00:02:25,557
which is why
he couldn't recognize

53
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:27,857
a man who was still in love.

54
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,358
2x21:
I Know Things Now

55
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:37,658
Every family
has a way of hiding

56
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,491
what it doesn't want seen.

57
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:42,491
Whether it's with a picture

58
00:02:42,524 --> 00:02:46,557
that covers
a stain on the wall...

59
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:52,324
or with a closet door that
conceals the chaos inside...

60
00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:54,324
or with artificial smiles

61
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:58,491
that mask
years of pain and heartache,

62
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:00,658
every family
goes to great lengths

63
00:03:00,691 --> 00:03:03,291
to hide ugly truths.

64
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:07,057
Some, of course,
go further than others.

65
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,790
So are you
gonna do this tonight?

66
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,591
No, the ice cream
is for tomorrow.

67
00:03:20,624 --> 00:03:24,557
I'm taking Caleb on a picnic
to Rockwater Lake.

68
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:26,890
I'm preparing
all of his favorite foods.

69
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:30,691
So when you're done,
you're just gonna...

70
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:32,224
leave him lying there?

71
00:03:34,224 --> 00:03:35,724
No.

72
00:03:38,457 --> 00:03:41,224
I'll call 9-1-1 anonymously,

73
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:45,957
but I will be watching
from a distance to make sure

74
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,391
that...
that they pick up his body.

75
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,758
You know, mom,
you don't have to do this.

76
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,758
I won't let him
hurt another girl,

77
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,257
and I will not
turn him over

78
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,557
to people who will
mock and abuse him.

79
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:02,090
I just won't.

80
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,424
His last day on this earth

81
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,024
is going to be a perfect one.

82
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,357
Oh, no, thanks, Xiao-Mei.

83
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:23,124
The poor thing.
She was so attached to Lily.

84
00:04:23,157 --> 00:04:24,923
Where'd all this food come from?

85
00:04:24,957 --> 00:04:26,691
The people
from Carlos' church.

86
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:30,291
So you think you and Carlos
will try for another adoption?

87
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:33,057
I don't think I could
go through that pain again.

88
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,557
I did freeze some of my eggs,
so we might

89
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:37,658
do the surrogacy thing,
but I don't know.

90
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:40,691
- Honey, you've got to eat something.
- I don't have an appetite.

91
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:42,691
In fact,
this is all gonna go to waste.

92
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:45,291
- You guys should take something.
- No, no, you should keep it.

93
00:04:45,324 --> 00:04:47,257
I'll take a couple.

94
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:52,890
What?
Karl dumped me, so I'm alone.

95
00:04:52,923 --> 00:04:55,291
Food fills the void.

96
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,790
Xiao-Mei, I appreciate
your grief, but, really,

97
00:04:59,823 --> 00:05:02,124
you're bringing everybody down.
Will you pull it together?

98
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:03,923
Mrs. Solis...

99
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,524
I don't understand.
It's from the government.

100
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:12,890
Let me see.

101
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:14,524
G aby,
she's being deported.

102
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:16,557
Xiao-Mei, is this
the first letter like this

103
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:17,557
you've received?

104
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:27,024
Oh, my...
this can't be happening.

105
00:05:27,057 --> 00:05:29,291
I can't go home!

106
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:31,257
My uncle will sell me again.

107
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,790
Oh, no, no, Xiao-Mei,
you're not going anywhere.

108
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,024
Hey, you're much too important
to Carlos and me.

109
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:38,224
We're  gonna fight this
and we're gonna win.

110
00:05:38,257 --> 00:05:40,391
Gaby, you can't promise her that.

111
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,391
Bree,
you heard what she said.

112
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:44,790
I can't let this poor kid
go back to China

113
00:05:44,823 --> 00:05:46,790
and become someone's slave.

114
00:05:46,823 --> 00:05:48,324
Thank you.

115
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:51,990
All right. Look, my friends
wanna take some of this to go,

116
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:55,291
so pack it up, and we're
a little low on coffee.

117
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:03,758
You're actually
gonna let me eat this?

118
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,658
Well, you've been
working so hard,

119
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:07,857
off on business trips
all the time.

120
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,324
Tonight, we throw caution
and cholesterol to the wind.

121
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:14,758
You deserve
a little comfort food.

122
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,424
Oh no, you're pregnant.

123
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:20,557
God, your mind
goes to dark places.

124
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:24,823
Honey, you just served me
a plate of full-fat gouda.

125
00:06:24,857 --> 00:06:26,057
What's up?

126
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,691
Okay, well...

127
00:06:28,724 --> 00:06:33,057
Remember I was helping Ed
spark up his love life?

128
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,391
Yeah, you sent his wife
those sexy IMs. Why?

129
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:38,424
Well, Fran found out
that Ed didn't send them,

130
00:06:38,457 --> 00:06:40,424
and she blew her top.

131
00:06:40,457 --> 00:06:43,057
She wants
the responsible party fired,

132
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,291
and Ed lied and told her...

133
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,790
that you sent them.

134
00:06:48,823 --> 00:06:50,857
But... but it wasn't me.
It was you.

135
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,691
I know.

136
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:54,691
Oh, oh, but Ed couldn't
possibly lose you.

137
00:06:54,724 --> 00:06:57,224
No, no, no,
I'm the expendable one.

138
00:06:57,257 --> 00:06:59,424
Look, I know it's ridiculous,

139
00:06:59,457 --> 00:07:01,823
but Ed is not a rational person.

140
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:03,324
Fran has him whipped,

141
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:06,457
and a whipped husband is someone
we must take very seriously.

142
00:07:07,857 --> 00:07:09,524
Okay.

143
00:07:10,957 --> 00:07:13,257
How do we handle this?

144
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,759
You're under contract.

145
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:17,620
Ed can't fire you
unless he has just cause.

146
00:07:17,651 --> 00:07:21,151
So until this blows over,
you have to be a model employee.

147
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,157
Show up on time,
no more 3-martini lunches,

148
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,224
And above all, have ready
all your presentations.

149
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:29,923
I can't believe
I'm being victimized like this.

150
00:07:29,957 --> 00:07:32,391
Well, honey,
in all fairness...

151
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:35,957
those are all things
you should be doing anyway.

152
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,257
Fine!

153
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:50,823
Andrew, I am having Peter
over for dinner tomorrow night,

154
00:07:50,857 --> 00:07:54,424
and I was wondering if you
would like to invite Justin?

155
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:57,691
Yeah. Um, thanks.
I'll... I'll call him tonight.

156
00:07:57,724 --> 00:07:59,691
Since you two are having
your boyfriends over,

157
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:02,190
- can I invite Matthew?
- Out of the question.

158
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:04,724
So let me get this straight.
You can date a lush,

159
00:08:04,758 --> 00:08:06,724
and he can bring over
his gay lover,

160
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:08,724
but  God forbid
I date a hot black guy.

161
00:08:08,758 --> 00:08:10,224
Until they lock Caleb up,

162
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,524
I don't want you
anywhere near that family.

163
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:14,524
His brother tried to rape you,

164
00:08:14,557 --> 00:08:17,024
and his mother keeps the guy
locked up in a basement.

165
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:19,524
I mean, let's face it, Danielle,
even you could do better.

166
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:21,890
Since when do you take
mom's side over mine?

167
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:24,057
Your brother and I had a talk,

168
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,658
and we've come
to a détente of sorts.

169
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:29,990
Really? Even after she screwed
you out of your trust fund?

170
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:32,291
Well, he did falsely accuse me
of child abuse.

171
00:08:32,324 --> 00:08:34,324
I would say we're even.
Wouldn't you, Andrew?

172
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:36,758
Sure, mom. We're even.

173
00:08:42,057 --> 00:08:44,524
You can stop smiling now.

174
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,591
- I know your face is tired.
- What?

175
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:48,990
I'm not stupid. I know you
hate her now as much as ever.

176
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:51,457
Mom and I are
in a good place right now.

177
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:54,124
Why can't you believe that?

178
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:58,024
Hi. I got your message.
What's up?

179
00:08:58,057 --> 00:09:01,157
Come on in.

180
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,658
This is Oliver Weston.

181
00:09:02,691 --> 00:09:05,424
He's a PI Edie hired.

182
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:07,890
Edie hired a... PI?

183
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,724
Yeah. He's been
spying on you and Karl.

184
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,524
How you doing?

185
00:09:11,557 --> 00:09:13,424
He thinks you two
have been having an affair.

186
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:15,790
Me and Karl?

187
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:18,524
Why would you think that?

188
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:22,758
Come on, Suze. You know
we're meant to be together.

189
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,257
Karl, just stop.

190
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,291
Well...

191
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:30,057
that is Karl being nostalgic.

192
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,591
You said yourself,

193
00:09:31,624 --> 00:09:33,724
the sex last week
was the best you ever had.

194
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:38,291
Okay, um...

195
00:09:38,324 --> 00:09:41,090
first of all, it was not
the best sex I ever had.

196
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:43,090
I just said that
to make him feel better.

197
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,724
Obviously, you
were the best sex I ever had.

198
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:47,658
That explains
the punch in the face.

199
00:09:47,691 --> 00:09:49,790
I'm gonna hit you again
if you don't shut up.

200
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,790
I know that this looks bad...

201
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:53,990
You were actually fooling around
with Karl behind Edie's back.

202
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:58,224
He told me that he and Edie
had split up before...

203
00:09:58,257 --> 00:10:00,591
- You know what? I don't even care.
- Mike...

204
00:10:00,624 --> 00:10:02,890
- Are we done here?
- Yeah.

205
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:05,624
Good night, Susan.

206
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:12,057
Hey! Hey, you!
Wait, wait, wait. Um...

207
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,890
Okay, you cannot
tell Edie about this.

208
00:10:13,923 --> 00:10:16,557
Whatever she's paying you,
I'll pay you double.

209
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:19,257
She paid a 2-grand retainer
plus expenses.

210
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,090
$2,000?

211
00:10:21,124 --> 00:10:24,124
Jeez! I gotta
get into real estate.

212
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:26,857
Okay, I don't have
that kind of cash.

213
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,391
Well, then I guess
I take the tape to Ms. Britt.

214
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,591
I have a copy!

215
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:45,224
Okay,
let's try this another way.

216
00:10:45,257 --> 00:10:49,257
You are about to unleash
a nuclear explosion.

217
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,024
Lives are
going to be ruined.

218
00:10:52,057 --> 00:10:53,524
I'll tell you what.

219
00:10:53,557 --> 00:10:55,957
I'll hold off till Monday
to report to Ms. Britt.

220
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,957
- Yes!
- That'll give you some time to scrape together

221
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,391
- a little cash.
- What if I can't?

222
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,251
I'm sorry, but Xiao-Mei missed
all of her appeal deadlines.

223
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:18,683
So that's it? You're just
gonna send her back to China?

224
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:20,417
My hands are tied.

225
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:23,518
If your maid were married
to an American citizen,

226
00:11:23,551 --> 00:11:26,084
or had a child
who was an American citizen,

227
00:11:26,117 --> 00:11:28,551
or if she were
a well-known entertainer...

228
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:29,884
Uh...

229
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:33,317
what if she was pregnant
with an American citizen?

230
00:11:37,518 --> 00:11:39,551
Uh, Xiao-Mei?

231
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,551
We spoke
to Homeland Security,

232
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:45,050
and we have good news!

233
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:46,317
I can stay?

234
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:47,384
Mm-hmm!

235
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:49,451
Oh! Thank you!

236
00:11:49,484 --> 00:11:50,950
- Oh! Okay.
- Thank you!

237
00:11:50,984 --> 00:11:54,184
Uh... well,
there's just one little thing.

238
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:58,384
The immigration laws have gotten
really tough in this country,

239
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,683
so we're a little
behind the eight ball going in.

240
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:03,017
But  we pled your case,

241
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,017
and we fought tooth and nail,
and the law says you can stay...

242
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,884
but only
if you have our baby.

243
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:11,551
What?

244
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:13,551
The agent said that if you were...

245
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:16,618
pregnant with an american citizen,

246
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,217
then they couldn't deport you.

247
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:21,683
So we thought,
you need a baby in your belly,

248
00:12:21,717 --> 00:12:23,351
we need a surrogate...

249
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:25,217
win-win-win.

250
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,917
"Sur-ro-gate"?

251
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,584
Oh, well,
it would be our baby.

252
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,017
It would just
be growing inside of you.

253
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:36,950
I...

254
00:12:36,984 --> 00:12:39,417
Okay, uh... well...

255
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:41,251
uh... oh!
Okay, it's like this...

256
00:12:41,284 --> 00:12:44,551
the three of us are making
your famous Szechuan dumplings,

257
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:47,518
and I'm the dough,

258
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:50,484
and Carlos is the pork,

259
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:53,251
and you're the oven.

260
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,950
I have baby?!

261
00:12:57,984 --> 00:12:59,950
Okay,
we take care of everything.

262
00:12:59,984 --> 00:13:01,917
You know,
uh, hospital bills

263
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,251
and maternity clothes
and Lamaze classes.

264
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,417
And, of course, you wouldn't
have to do any work.

265
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:09,384
Well, uh, maybe
just a little light dusting.

266
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:10,584
Nothing major.

267
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:13,251
No!

268
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:15,251
No, Xiao-Mei,
you don't have a choice.

269
00:13:15,284 --> 00:13:16,783
It's either this
or go back to China.

270
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:18,217
No to baby!

271
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:20,584
No!

272
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:27,650
Had to push the dusting,
didn't you?

273
00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:33,417
Peter, I don't think
I'm being unreasonable here.

274
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:36,650
It's not like I'm gonna
advertise my addiction history,

275
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,917
but if your kids
ask a direct question,

276
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,451
I'm not gonna lie to them.

277
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:43,917
Right! Uh-huh. Good point.

278
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:47,984
Listen,
I don't expect you to lie

279
00:13:48,017 --> 00:13:50,717
about the alcoholism. I mean,
they know that's how we met.

280
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,884
It's just...
you know, the other thing.

281
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:56,817
- Oh! The other thing.
- They're just getting to know you,

282
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,618
and so I want them
to focus on your good qualities.

283
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,618
I just don't know
how they'll react

284
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,950
if they find out
that you're a sex addict.

285
00:14:06,984 --> 00:14:08,850
What are you so happy about?

286
00:14:08,884 --> 00:14:10,783
You know how you were mad at mom

287
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,317
about not letting Matthew
come to dinner?

288
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:14,351
Yeah?

289
00:14:14,384 --> 00:14:16,384
I  just figured out the funniest way

290
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:19,484
for you to get back at her.

291
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:22,551
Okay, what's on the schedule
for today?

292
00:14:22,584 --> 00:14:25,217
I have got the Boston Toy
presentation ready to go.

293
00:14:25,251 --> 00:14:27,750
Actually, I don't have time
for a full pitch,

294
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,050
so just give me the gist.

295
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:31,950
Excuse me?

296
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:35,117
You know, boil it down.
Give me one line.

297
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,384
Okay, basically,
it's "Toys are fun."

298
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:44,351
- I hate it.
- How can you hate it?
I only gave you three words.

299
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,217
It's three words I hate.

300
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:48,750
Okay, I'm gonna take over
the Boston Toy Company account.

301
00:14:48,783 --> 00:14:50,717
- No, you cannot take over...
- In the meantime,

302
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,017
you should all be aware
I don't like the way

303
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,217
you people have been filing
your expense reports.

304
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:58,050
There's been
a lot of padding.

305
00:14:58,084 --> 00:15:00,717
Meanwhile, this company
is hemorrhaging money.

306
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,717
I'm gonna put a stop to it,

307
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,750
so I have hired
a forensic accountant.

308
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:07,151
He's gonna go through them,
make sure everything's kosher.

309
00:15:07,184 --> 00:15:10,650
And I find one receipt,
one bar tab that's fishy,

310
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:12,717
it's grounds for dismissal.

311
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:16,817
Oh,  Scavo?

312
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,017
He's gonna start with you.

313
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,050
I can't believe
that son of a bitch

314
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:23,551
hired a forensic accountant.

315
00:15:23,584 --> 00:15:25,551
He's more whipped than I thought.

316
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:27,551
Well, he's tragically
underestimated us.

317
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:29,551
The gloves are coming off.

318
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:31,551
You know,
maybe I should just quit.

319
00:15:31,584 --> 00:15:33,551
What? Yesterday
you were up in arms.

320
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:36,850
- Now you're ready to cave?
- If Ed is determined to get me, sooner or later

321
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:39,351
he's gonna get me.
It's just a matter of time.

322
00:15:39,384 --> 00:15:41,151
No, no!
We are not backing down.

323
00:15:41,184 --> 00:15:43,151
I'm gonna walk over
to Ed's office right now,

324
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:45,551
and I'm gonna make very clear
that if you're out the door,

325
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:47,884
- I'm right behind ya.
- We can't both be unemployed.

326
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,884
Oh, it'll never happen.
He knows this place

327
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:52,683
will go down like
a house of cards without me.

328
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:54,351
Honey, wait. Just wait!

329
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:55,650
What, what?

330
00:15:55,683 --> 00:15:59,050
I'm not gonna hide
behind my wife's skirt.

331
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,284
We're a team.
I'm just lending support.

332
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:03,251
That's not the way
it's gonna look

333
00:16:03,284 --> 00:16:05,117
to everybody else out there.

334
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:07,950
Look, let me talk to him,
man to man.

335
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:11,417
If my way doesn't work,
then we'll do it your way.

336
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:15,017
Okay, go get him.

337
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:29,050
Lynette filled me in

338
00:16:29,084 --> 00:16:31,317
about what happened
with you and Fran and the IM,

339
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:34,351
and I gotta tell ya, this isn't fair.
This isn't right.

340
00:16:43,683 --> 00:16:46,417
Oh, my God!

341
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:48,683
Tom, what happened?

342
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,717
I think
I gave him just cause.

343
00:16:52,884 --> 00:16:53,950
Uh...

344
00:16:58,871 --> 00:17:01,971
Susan knew she couldn't afford
to keep the PI

345
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:04,804
from revealing
her affair with Karl,

346
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:08,370
and since Edie would learn
the truth anyway,

347
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:12,904
Susan felt it would be better
if it came from her...

348
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:15,403
which is how
she came to write a letter

349
00:17:15,437 --> 00:17:18,004
begging Edie for forgiveness.

350
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,670
Her words were so sincere
and heartfelt,

351
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:24,403
from the moment she mailed it,
Susan knew...

352
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:29,303
she was a dead woman.

353
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,004
You know, Caleb...

354
00:17:36,037 --> 00:17:38,704
since the day
you were born,

355
00:17:38,737 --> 00:17:42,704
I've always thought of you
as a blessing.

356
00:17:42,737 --> 00:17:45,171
You do know that, right?

357
00:17:45,204 --> 00:17:48,537
I guess.

358
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:52,904
How come Matty's not here?

359
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:56,971
Because
this is our special day,

360
00:17:57,004 --> 00:17:59,737
just you and me.

361
00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:02,037
Is he mad at me?

362
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:03,570
'Cause of Danielle?

363
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:07,403
No. He knows that
you didn't mean to scare her.

364
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:11,570
'Cause he said it was okay
for me to kiss her.

365
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:13,238
What did you say?

366
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,270
He said Danielle liked me

367
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:19,270
and that she wouldn't fight me
if I gave her a kiss.

368
00:18:19,303 --> 00:18:21,071
Your brother told you that?

369
00:18:21,104 --> 00:18:24,303
Matty said that
she was waiting for me

370
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,337
and that she wanted
a really big kiss.

371
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,537
What else
did your brother tell you?

372
00:18:37,104 --> 00:18:38,437
Xiao-Mei?

373
00:18:40,904 --> 00:18:42,904
I made you some hot cocoa.

374
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:48,238
I guess the baby thing didn't
really appeal to you, huh?

375
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,570
I know it's a lot to ask.

376
00:18:51,604 --> 00:18:54,238
It's just, Carlos and I
think of you as family.

377
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,238
Don't you
think of us as family?

378
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,171
Oh, yes!

379
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:02,138
You are like mother to me.

380
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:04,804
Mm-hmm.

381
00:19:04,837 --> 00:19:07,437
Well, if we are so friggin' close,

382
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,937
what's the big deal?

383
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:10,937
It's nine months
out of your life.

384
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:12,904
I will be ruined.

385
00:19:12,937 --> 00:19:15,071
"Ruined"?

386
00:19:17,537 --> 00:19:19,037
Down there.

387
00:19:21,737 --> 00:19:23,171
Wait.

388
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,737
Are you a virgin?

389
00:19:25,904 --> 00:19:27,670
Wow!

390
00:19:27,704 --> 00:19:31,804
If I have baby,
I will be shamed.

391
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,004
Are you kidding?

392
00:19:34,037 --> 00:19:36,504
No one cares about virginity
in this country.

393
00:19:36,537 --> 00:19:38,504
It went out of style
in the '50s,

394
00:19:38,537 --> 00:19:41,670
and trust me, honey,
it ain't making a comeback.

395
00:19:41,704 --> 00:19:44,704
Seriously, no one cares.

396
00:19:44,737 --> 00:19:46,771
Husband would care.

397
00:19:46,804 --> 00:19:49,004
No man want me if I ruined.

398
00:19:49,037 --> 00:19:53,138
I want husband so much.

399
00:19:55,037 --> 00:19:57,504
Well, what kind of husband
do you want?

400
00:19:57,537 --> 00:19:59,537
Do you want a rich husband?

401
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,204
Well, then,

402
00:20:01,238 --> 00:20:03,403
rich men don't marry virgins
for the same reasons

403
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:05,871
they don't hire chauffeurs
who can't drive.

404
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,704
They value experience.

405
00:20:07,737 --> 00:20:09,637
Really?

406
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,637
Would I lie to family?

407
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:19,704
Here are the numbers
you wanted.

408
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:22,071
Lynette, wait.

409
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:24,737
- Have you heard from Tom?
- He's not answering his cell phone.

410
00:20:24,771 --> 00:20:26,570
But you don't have
to worry, okay?

411
00:20:26,604 --> 00:20:28,904
You got what you wanted.
He's out of the building.

412
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:31,537
Come in here
and close the door.

413
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,537
You sure?
I might punch you, too.

414
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,238
I'll take my chances.

415
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,971
If this is where you want me
to apologize for my husband,

416
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:42,537
I'm not gonna do it.

417
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,037
Maybe he shouldn't have hit you,
but you provoked him.

418
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:48,704
- Now wait a minute...
- No! I'm sorry, Tom gets punished

419
00:20:48,737 --> 00:20:51,004
because you can't deal
with your screwed-up marriage.

420
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:52,704
It is pathetic, Ed.

421
00:20:52,737 --> 00:20:54,904
If you had stood up
to your wife in the first place,

422
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:56,904
- none of this... what?
- I love it.

423
00:20:56,937 --> 00:20:59,537
You're giving me crap
about my marriage.

424
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,871
You know what? Here!

425
00:21:01,904 --> 00:21:04,904
Oh, the forensic accountant
found some interesting stuff

426
00:21:04,937 --> 00:21:07,037
in Tom's expense reports.

427
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:09,037
Yeah, it seems
on his last three trips east,

428
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:11,037
he cashed in
his first-class ticket

429
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:14,470
- and took a detour to Atlantic City.
- What? That can't be right.

430
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:17,904
Well, it's all there.
Hotels, bar tabs...

431
00:21:17,937 --> 00:21:19,837
oh, and on this page...

432
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:21,871
two tickets to a show.

433
00:21:24,303 --> 00:21:26,138
And flowers.

434
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:30,837
That doesn't make any sense.

435
00:21:30,871 --> 00:21:33,871
There's gotta be some
kind of an explanation for this.

436
00:21:33,904 --> 00:21:37,704
Before you pass judgment
on someone else's marriage,

437
00:21:37,737 --> 00:21:40,270
I'd clean up
my own house first.

438
00:21:44,257 --> 00:21:46,057
Sorry, I don't know

439
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,157
- what's taking Danielle so long to get dressed.
- Just give her a break, mom.

440
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:50,524
I'm sure she's just trying
to look nice for our company.

441
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:52,558
Well, I hope she doesn't get
too dressed up.

442
00:21:52,591 --> 00:21:54,558
I like people to be comfortable.

443
00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:56,224
Oh, I'm comfortable.

444
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,324
Honey, what are you wearing?

445
00:22:00,357 --> 00:22:02,524
You got me this for Christmas.
Don't you remember?

446
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:05,357
Yes, I just... I'm worried
you might be a little cold.

447
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,723
Oh, I think
it's plenty warm in here.

448
00:22:07,757 --> 00:22:10,324
Don't you, Mr. McMillan?

449
00:22:10,357 --> 00:22:14,057
Uh... sure.

450
00:22:15,524 --> 00:22:18,090
Well, uh, we should
probably start eating.

451
00:22:18,124 --> 00:22:20,024
We don't want
our frittatas to get cold.

452
00:22:20,057 --> 00:22:23,591
Right. Good. Um, sorry.
Everybody, dig in.

453
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:32,057
Does anybody else think
this salsa's a little too spicy?

454
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,690
I always say,
the hotter, the better.

455
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:42,690
So, Mr. McMillan, I hear
you went to Perkins college.

456
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:44,757
I'm thinking about going there
after I graduate.

457
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,690
Uh, Perkins, huh?

458
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:50,424
I was there.
Yeah, I made it to every party,

459
00:22:50,457 --> 00:22:52,890
and I went to classes
in my spare time.

460
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:58,491
No, actually, it's a great college.
I think you'd like it.

461
00:22:58,524 --> 00:22:59,990
Isn't this wonderful?

462
00:23:00,024 --> 00:23:03,124
Good food,
pleasant conversation...

463
00:23:03,157 --> 00:23:05,924
this really is
a very special night.

464
00:23:07,324 --> 00:23:09,690
I feel the same way.

465
00:23:14,624 --> 00:23:16,391
So, Peter, is it growing?

466
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,591
What?

467
00:23:20,624 --> 00:23:23,890
Uh, the campus. Has it grown
at all since you've been there?

468
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:25,690
Uh...

469
00:23:27,124 --> 00:23:28,990
yeah, it's, uh...

470
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,257
it's grown...
con-considerably.

471
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,524
I would just love
to get my hands on a brochure.

472
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:39,324
The alumni association

473
00:23:39,357 --> 00:23:40,924
is always sending me stuff,
you know.

474
00:23:40,957 --> 00:23:42,924
I'll... I'll get you something!

475
00:23:42,957 --> 00:23:45,157
Oh my God, are you okay?

476
00:23:47,624 --> 00:23:49,957
I just remembered, you know,
this guy I'm sponsoring...

477
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,957
he said he needed to see me
tonight, so I should go to him.

478
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,424
Well, I guess
that's important, so...

479
00:23:55,457 --> 00:23:58,457
Yeah, so I should go.
No need to show me out.

480
00:24:03,757 --> 00:24:05,224
What a shame.

481
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:07,224
I really wanted him
to have a chance

482
00:24:07,257 --> 00:24:09,723
to get to know you guys.

483
00:24:09,757 --> 00:24:12,257
Don't worry, I...
I think we made an impression.

484
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,924
Hey. Hey!

485
00:24:22,024 --> 00:24:24,491
I didn't know
if you were coming back.

486
00:24:24,524 --> 00:24:27,890
I waited until
the parking lot cleared.

487
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,024
So, um...

488
00:24:30,057 --> 00:24:31,291
what happened?

489
00:24:31,324 --> 00:24:34,291
You said you were just gonna
go in there and talk to him.

490
00:24:34,324 --> 00:24:35,790
I know, I know.

491
00:24:35,823 --> 00:24:37,823
I know I shouldn't have hit him.

492
00:24:37,857 --> 00:24:40,057
But...
what's done is done.

493
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:43,823
Anything else going on?

494
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,157
Like what?

495
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:47,357
I don't know.

496
00:24:47,391 --> 00:24:49,558
Anything you wanna talk about?

497
00:24:49,591 --> 00:24:52,057
'Cause there's nothing
you couldn't tell me.

498
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,558
- I would understand.
- No, I feel good about this.

499
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:57,157
It's okay, 'cause I didn't
fit in around here anyway.

500
00:24:57,191 --> 00:25:00,090
I'm gonna get another job
someplace else.

501
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,757
Everything's good.

502
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,591
And you, I love.

503
00:25:03,624 --> 00:25:05,124
I love you, too.

504
00:25:08,823 --> 00:25:10,723
You know what's weird?

505
00:25:10,757 --> 00:25:13,457
No, what?

506
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:16,457
In all the years
we have been married,

507
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:20,790
I have never seen you
lead with your fists.

508
00:25:20,823 --> 00:25:23,424
Well...

509
00:25:23,457 --> 00:25:27,191
maybe I still got
some surprises in me.

510
00:25:28,924 --> 00:25:30,591
Maybe you do.

511
00:25:36,424 --> 00:25:38,558
Is it done?

512
00:25:38,591 --> 00:25:40,357
Mm-hmm.

513
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:44,191
We can mourn
your brother later.

514
00:25:44,224 --> 00:25:47,124
Right now there are things
that still need to be done.

515
00:25:47,157 --> 00:25:50,990
We need to get rid
of everything...

516
00:25:51,024 --> 00:25:53,524
mattress, clothes,
all of it.

517
00:26:05,257 --> 00:26:07,224
Mom, the... the door's locked.

518
00:26:07,257 --> 00:26:09,024
I know.

519
00:26:10,357 --> 00:26:15,090
Mom, you need
to open this door right now!

520
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:19,558
Mom!

521
00:26:37,328 --> 00:26:39,393
Honey,
why aren't you dressed yet?

522
00:26:39,427 --> 00:26:40,894
We have to be
at the fertility clinic

523
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:43,261
- in 40 minutes!
- Aw, shoot! Is that today?

524
00:26:43,294 --> 00:26:45,594
And, uh, give Xiao-Mei
a kick in the pants.

525
00:26:45,627 --> 00:26:47,627
I haven't seen her all morning.

526
00:26:51,493 --> 00:26:53,127
Hey.

527
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:55,894
Today's the, uh, big day.

528
00:26:55,927 --> 00:26:59,261
You ready to, uh, make a baby?

529
00:27:01,194 --> 00:27:02,694
Ready.

530
00:27:14,827 --> 00:27:17,194
Please...

531
00:27:17,228 --> 00:27:18,627
be gentle.

532
00:27:25,627 --> 00:27:28,127
Honey, come on.
We're gonna be late.

533
00:27:31,493 --> 00:27:34,094
Hmm, uh...

534
00:27:34,127 --> 00:27:35,594
I think she's confused

535
00:27:35,627 --> 00:27:38,927
as to how we're gonna
make this baby happen.

536
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:42,328
Oh. And were you planning
on setting her straight?

537
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,627
Next thing out of my mouth.

538
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,161
Come on!
The guy's ready to explode.

539
00:27:52,194 --> 00:27:54,794
I don't care. I'm not
sleeping with mom's boyfriend.

540
00:27:54,827 --> 00:27:56,894
You can't back out now.
You were great the other night.

541
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:59,894
- You got Peter on the hook. He's primed.
- I was just messing with his head

542
00:27:59,927 --> 00:28:01,460
to get back at mom.
That's all.

543
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:04,027
Yeah, but why stop there?
She's keeping you from Matthew.

544
00:28:04,061 --> 00:28:06,027
Now, come on,
she deserves this.

545
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,328
I'm not that stupid.
Go grind your own ax.

546
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,228
That's him.
I don't have time for this crap.

547
00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:14,261
- Now strip down to your bra and panties now.
- Get out of my room, you psycho!

548
00:28:18,861 --> 00:28:20,660
Um, my mom won't be back
for a while,

549
00:28:20,694 --> 00:28:23,161
- so you probably don't wanna wait around.
- Well, that's okay.

550
00:28:23,194 --> 00:28:25,660
I just wanted to make sure
you got the Perkins catalog.

551
00:28:25,694 --> 00:28:28,560
Uh, your mom told me that you're
going on a tour there tomorrow.

552
00:28:28,594 --> 00:28:30,594
- Yeah.
- You're gonna love it.

553
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:33,294
The campus is beautiful,
the teachers are amazing,

554
00:28:33,328 --> 00:28:35,827
and the student body
is such a great mix.

555
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:38,493
You know,
they're all about diversity.

556
00:28:38,527 --> 00:28:39,794
Whatever.

557
00:28:39,827 --> 00:28:42,194
All right, well, I'll let
my mom know you stopped by.

558
00:28:42,228 --> 00:28:43,861
Okay.

559
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,961
Andrew...
I also wanted to apologize

560
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,228
for leaving so fast
the other night.

561
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:53,427
I...

562
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,427
I started
to get the feeling

563
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,427
that your sister
was coming on to me,

564
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,861
- which was upsetting because...
- You're a sex addict?

565
00:29:00,894 --> 00:29:03,127
Your mom told you about that?

566
00:29:03,161 --> 00:29:06,594
Let's just say the word's out.

567
00:29:06,627 --> 00:29:08,560
But, um, I'm curious.

568
00:29:08,594 --> 00:29:12,360
Back in the day, what kind
of stuff were you into?

569
00:29:12,393 --> 00:29:14,527
I don't know that
I wanna talk about that.

570
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,527
Well, I just wanna make sure

571
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,127
you're not into anything
too freaky.

572
00:29:18,161 --> 00:29:19,794
You know, I mean,

573
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:22,660
you are dating my mom,
and I'm kinda protective of her.

574
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,127
Well, you can relax.

575
00:29:24,161 --> 00:29:26,627
I mean, I wasn't some
sort of pervert, you know.

576
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,094
All I can say is...
I went through a dark period,

577
00:29:29,127 --> 00:29:31,460
and I slept with
a whole lot of people.

578
00:29:33,161 --> 00:29:34,294
People?

579
00:29:34,328 --> 00:29:36,360
What's wrong?

580
00:29:36,393 --> 00:29:40,527
No, it's just that when most
guys discuss their conquests,

581
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,027
they don't say "people."

582
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:46,393
Oh, well...

583
00:29:46,427 --> 00:29:48,694
No, it's okay.

584
00:29:48,727 --> 00:29:51,827
I appreciate the fact
that you value...

585
00:29:51,861 --> 00:29:53,760
diversity.

586
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:03,061
- Who is it?
- Mike.

587
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,961
Susan?

588
00:30:07,994 --> 00:30:09,594
Hi. Sorry.

589
00:30:09,627 --> 00:30:11,594
I'm just on the lookout for Edie.

590
00:30:11,627 --> 00:30:14,961
Oh, well, you can relax.
Edie won't be coming after you.

591
00:30:14,994 --> 00:30:17,994
- Why?
- I talked to the PI, and he's
not gonna tell her anything.

592
00:30:18,027 --> 00:30:20,460
What did you say?

593
00:30:20,493 --> 00:30:23,427
I paid him off, so it's over.

594
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,627
I just thought you should know.

595
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,994
Well, wait.

596
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:29,627
Why would you do that?

597
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,760
People will just get hurt
if it gets out.

598
00:30:32,794 --> 00:30:34,794
I didn't see the point.

599
00:30:49,794 --> 00:30:52,527
Uh... oh...

600
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,760
Come on, come on, come on.

601
00:31:08,927 --> 00:31:11,827
Hey there.
You look thirsty.

602
00:31:11,861 --> 00:31:14,727
This is really nice of you,
Mrs. Mayer.

603
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,794
To be honest with you,
I wasn't even sure that you liked me.

604
00:31:17,827 --> 00:31:19,794
And you know why?
Because we're all so busy

605
00:31:19,827 --> 00:31:23,861
and detached from each other.
You're at my house every day,

606
00:31:23,894 --> 00:31:25,961
and sure,
we wave and we say hello,

607
00:31:25,994 --> 00:31:28,527
but we barely even
know each other.

608
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,328
How long have you
been delivering my mail,

609
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,228
- for God's sake?
- Three and a half weeks.

610
00:31:33,261 --> 00:31:35,727
Really?

611
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,660
It seems like forever.

612
00:31:37,694 --> 00:31:39,161
Let me top you off.

613
00:31:39,194 --> 00:31:41,560
Oh, no, I couldn't.
This is my third glass. I...

614
00:31:41,594 --> 00:31:43,094
Seriously, I'm sloshin'.

615
00:31:44,294 --> 00:31:47,527
Well, you probably wanna use
the bathroom before you leave, huh?

616
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,694
- No, I'm good.
- Are you sure?

617
00:31:49,727 --> 00:31:51,660
Uh, I mean,
you have such a long route,

618
00:31:51,694 --> 00:31:53,827
and that ice tea's
gonna go right through ya.

619
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:57,927
It's better here than
Mrs. McCluskey's hydrangeas.

620
00:31:57,961 --> 00:32:01,760
Well, you know, uh...
maybe I will use your bathroom.

621
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,894
Great! Oh, the one
down here is broken.

622
00:32:03,927 --> 00:32:05,894
Why don't you use
the one upstairs?

623
00:32:05,927 --> 00:32:08,027
It's right off my bedroom.

624
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:10,427
Yeah.

625
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,360
Okay.

626
00:32:12,393 --> 00:32:13,894
Got it.

627
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:43,493
I still can't believe it.

628
00:32:43,527 --> 00:32:47,294
I mean, why would Xiao-Mei
just offer herself up to me like that?

629
00:32:47,328 --> 00:32:49,294
Well, honey, she's a virgin.

630
00:32:49,328 --> 00:32:51,127
Who knows why virgins
do anything?

631
00:32:51,161 --> 00:32:53,760
She's a virgin?

632
00:32:53,794 --> 00:32:55,360
Are you serious?

633
00:32:55,393 --> 00:32:58,827
Yeah. I wouldn't just
slam her for no reason.

634
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,527
Mr. Solis?

635
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,261
It's time to collect your DNA.

636
00:33:04,294 --> 00:33:08,027
Oh! Okay, honey,
only good swimmers now.

637
00:33:11,694 --> 00:33:13,161
If you like,

638
00:33:13,194 --> 00:33:16,694
we have a variety of magazines
and videos available.

639
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:21,961
Mm... I think I'm good.

640
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:32,493
Gus? Are you okay up there?

641
00:33:36,194 --> 00:33:39,627
Gus!

642
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,760
Uh, do you want me
to keep the hat on?

643
00:33:42,794 --> 00:33:46,228
I know it's a fantasy
for some women.

644
00:33:46,261 --> 00:33:48,061
Uh...

645
00:33:51,527 --> 00:33:52,694
Mom?

646
00:33:56,427 --> 00:33:58,094
Is the mailman here?

647
00:34:00,994 --> 00:34:03,760
That's my daughter.
Get dressed!

648
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:05,393
Mom?

649
00:34:05,427 --> 00:34:08,961
Yes, honey!
Gus the mailman is here!

650
00:34:08,994 --> 00:34:12,393
He's using the bathroom.
He'll be down in a minute.

651
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:14,460
Oh! Darn it.

652
00:34:14,493 --> 00:34:17,228
Guess we'll have
to take a rain check, huh?

653
00:34:17,261 --> 00:34:19,127
I can come back on Tuesday.

654
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:21,328
Tu-tuesday?

655
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,861
No, no, Tuesday's not good,

656
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,927
'cause Tuesday's
the day I, um...

657
00:34:25,961 --> 00:34:27,294
become a lesbian.

658
00:34:44,727 --> 00:34:44,760
Andrew?

659
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:48,994
Honey, where are you?
I got your message.

660
00:34:49,027 --> 00:34:51,961
What's the emergency?

661
00:34:51,994 --> 00:34:59,161
Andrew?

662
00:34:59,194 --> 00:35:02,660
Honey, what are you doing
in my bed?

663
00:35:02,694 --> 00:35:04,994
Have you seen my pants?
I can't...

664
00:35:09,927 --> 00:35:13,727
Now we're even.

665
00:35:18,061 --> 00:35:20,127
Did you forget
that we're supposed to take

666
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:22,127
that tour
of Perkins college today?

667
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,860
Seriously?

668
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:27,493
After last night, I didn't
exactly think you'd be too keen

669
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:29,961
on sitting next to me
in a car for three hours.

670
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,827
Consider me a cheerleader
for anything that expedites me

671
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,061
getting you out from
under my roof.

672
00:35:37,694 --> 00:35:39,627
Glad we can come
to an understanding.

673
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:04,227
Why'd we stop here?
We have half a tank left.

674
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:08,560
There's so many things
I wanna say to you, Andrew.

675
00:36:08,593 --> 00:36:12,727
But mostly, I just want you
to know how sorry I am.

676
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,361
Sorry for what?

677
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:19,328
Every child deserves
to be loved unconditionally,

678
00:36:19,361 --> 00:36:24,961
and I thought that was the kind
of love that I had for you.

679
00:36:24,994 --> 00:36:28,094
Maybe if I had,
it would've been different.

680
00:36:28,127 --> 00:36:31,094
Why do I
suddenly get the feeling

681
00:36:31,127 --> 00:36:34,061
we're not gonna make it out
to Perkins college today?

682
00:36:42,261 --> 00:36:43,794
What are you doing?

683
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,894
I packed up some of your things.

684
00:36:45,927 --> 00:36:48,627
There's also, um, an envelope
in here with some money,

685
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,660
and that should tide you over
until you get a job.

686
00:36:51,694 --> 00:36:56,328
What, you're gonna leave me out
here in the middle of nowhere?

687
00:36:56,361 --> 00:37:00,460
I noticed a bus stop
about a mile back.

688
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,094
You can go anywhere you want.

689
00:37:04,127 --> 00:37:07,660
Mama, mom,
please don't do this.

690
00:37:07,694 --> 00:37:09,827
I have to.

691
00:37:11,961 --> 00:37:15,894
I can't be around you anymore.
I'm just not strong enough.

692
00:37:20,394 --> 00:37:22,927
You know what
the good news is?

693
00:37:22,961 --> 00:37:25,328
I win.

694
00:37:25,361 --> 00:37:28,127
You win?

695
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:33,827
I remember the look in your eyes
when I told you I was gay,

696
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:38,127
and I knew that one day
you would stop loving me.

697
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:43,760
So here we are.

698
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,794
I was right

699
00:37:45,827 --> 00:37:48,961
and I... I win.

700
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,760
Well, good for you.

701
00:38:43,527 --> 00:38:46,527
Hi. I made you
a thank-you pie,

702
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,627
and by "made,"
I mean "bought."

703
00:39:29,794 --> 00:39:33,394
So what exactly
are you thanking me for?

704
00:39:33,428 --> 00:39:36,061
For keeping Edie
from smashing my face in.

705
00:39:38,061 --> 00:39:40,328
That's the nicest thing
anybody ever did for me.

706
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:43,328
Just... trying
to keep peace on the lane.

707
00:39:43,361 --> 00:39:46,560
Well, you keep
telling yourself that.

708
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,894
I know why
you really paid that guy off.

709
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,694
You still care about me.

710
00:39:52,727 --> 00:39:54,328
What?

711
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:58,660
You're always worried
about Julie and me,

712
00:39:58,694 --> 00:40:01,860
and you beat up
my new boyfriend.

713
00:40:02,927 --> 00:40:05,894
And now you're
protecting me from Edie.

714
00:40:05,927 --> 00:40:08,894
Do you know
what all that means?

715
00:40:08,927 --> 00:40:11,694
That you're high maintenance?

716
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,560
All right, you go ahead
and be coy. Fine.

717
00:40:18,593 --> 00:40:20,560
I'll be the one
to break the ice.

718
00:40:22,061 --> 00:40:24,994
I've never stopped
caring about you.

719
00:40:27,061 --> 00:40:29,660
Is that why
you jumped in bed with Karl?

720
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:31,660
I would've
never even gone there

721
00:40:31,694 --> 00:40:34,961
if I had thought
there was a chance with us.

722
00:40:34,994 --> 00:40:37,961
You just closed the door
so completely, I...

723
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,294
Ugh, can we just not
talk about him?

724
00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:45,760
Have some more pie.

725
00:40:45,794 --> 00:40:47,794
I know you like pie.

726
00:40:50,394 --> 00:40:52,394
I know you like me.

727
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:58,428
Listen...

728
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:01,727
I'm not asking
for us to get back together.

729
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,961
I just want us to be friends.

730
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,527
Susan?

731
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,227
Yes?

732
00:41:08,261 --> 00:41:10,927
Your house is on fire.

733
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,127
My whole house is... on fire!

734
00:41:19,161 --> 00:41:23,660
When the truth is ugly,
people try to keep it hidden,

735
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:26,394
because they know if revealed,

736
00:41:26,428 --> 00:41:29,694
the damage it will do.

737
00:41:29,727 --> 00:41:33,094
So they conceal it
within sturdy walls...

738
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:37,694
or they place it
behind closed doors...

739
00:41:39,361 --> 00:41:43,994
or they obscure it
with clever disguises.

740
00:41:44,027 --> 00:41:48,227
But truth, no matter how ugly,
always emerges...

741
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:56,894
and someone we care about

742
00:41:56,927 --> 00:41:59,827
always ends up getting hurt...

743
00:42:06,328 --> 00:42:10,660
and someone else
will revel in their pain,

744
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,860
and that's the ugliest truth of all.
