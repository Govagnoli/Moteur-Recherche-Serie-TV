1
00:00:00,173 --> 00:00:02,039
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...

2
00:00:02,072 --> 00:00:04,072
It seems on his last three trips east,

3
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:05,739
he cashed in his first class ticket

4
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:07,473
and took a detour to Atlantic City.

5
00:00:07,506 --> 00:00:10,239
Lynette received some disturbing news...

6
00:00:10,272 --> 00:00:14,039
- He said it was okay for me to kiss her.
- What else did your brother tell you?

7
00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:15,506
Caleb revealed a secret...

8
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:20,773
Susan made a first class confession...

9
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:23,639
You're going to leave me out here
in the middle of nowhere?

10
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:26,005
I can't be around you anymore.
I'm just not strong enough.

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,849
And Bree made the most difficult
decision of her life.

12
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:37,830
Susan Mayer had always believed

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,931
the one good thing about hard times

14
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:45,377
is that you get to find out
who your friends really are.

15
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:47,578
When her grandmother died,

16
00:00:47,603 --> 00:00:50,476
it was Bree who brought homemade cookies.

17
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:53,277
When the critics panned her third book,

18
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:57,037
it was Gabrielle who hired
the handsome masseur.

19
00:00:57,071 --> 00:00:59,776
When her divorce became final,

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,778
it was Lynette who poured the scotch.

21
00:01:03,803 --> 00:01:08,106
Sadly, Susan's life had been shattered once again.

22
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:10,106
But as always,

23
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,178
Her friends had come to help pick up the pieces.

24
00:01:14,203 --> 00:01:17,907
Susan? We've all been talking.

25
00:01:17,932 --> 00:01:20,976
We've decided you and Julie
should stay with Bree.

26
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:23,575
Oh, thanks. No, that's okay.
We'll stay at a motel.

27
00:01:23,603 --> 00:01:24,977
Absolutely not.

28
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:28,235
Just give me an hour or two
to straighten up Andrew's room,

29
00:01:28,272 --> 00:01:31,008
and then you can bring your... selves over.

30
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:32,777
I don't deserve friends like you.

31
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:34,278
We're aware of that.

32
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,908
Susan, you're running low on trash bags.

33
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:40,905
I'm going to run to the store.

34
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,905
Thanks, Orson. Thanks for coming.

35
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:44,678
You know, you didn't have to do this.

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,407
Hey, it's my pleasure.

37
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:53,135
Mrs. Mayer!

38
00:01:55,903 --> 00:01:57,235
Hi. Bud Penrod,

39
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,737
Town and country insurance.
The "can do" people.

40
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,046
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

41
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:04,538
Yeah. Look at that.

42
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,976
Well, that's no fun at all, is it?

43
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,477
No. No, it isn't.

44
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:11,078
So when am I gonna get the check?

45
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:12,877
'Cause I have a lot of rebuilding to do.

46
00:02:12,903 --> 00:02:14,875
I need to get started.

47
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:17,406
Yeah, well, I'm afraid
that's going to be a while.

48
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:20,506
You see, the fire department
has ruled that this was arson.

49
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:21,835
Arson?

50
00:02:21,872 --> 00:02:24,235
Yeah. So we can't give you any money

51
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,737
until we finish our investigation.

52
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,605
Who would wanna burn down my house?

53
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:30,376
I don't know.
Do you have any enemies?

54
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:32,675
No. No, look at it.

55
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,907
The whole neighborhood turned out to help.

56
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:37,706
I'm very popular.

57
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:41,105
And there's no one among them
that wishes you ill?

58
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:44,607
Oh, no, no. Everybody's been very helpful.

59
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:47,708
Um, everybody likes me. Absolutely...

60
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:51,978
everyone.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,306
Yes, hard times were what Susan used

62
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:57,437
to distinguish who was a friend

63
00:02:57,473 --> 00:03:00,475
and who wasn't.

64
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,478
2x22:
No One Is Alone

65
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:11,207
Not everyone enjoys being a small part

66
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,705
of a large community.

67
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:16,407
Indeed, some yearn to leave the stress and noise

68
00:03:16,431 --> 00:03:19,237
of constant companionship behind them.

69
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,237
So they strike out on their own,

70
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:25,278
hoping their solitude will bring
a little peace and quiet.

71
00:03:25,303 --> 00:03:28,147
It's only then they discover

72
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:30,836
how dangerous it is

73
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,248
to be alone in the world.

74
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:08,176
Zach, did you get the trash?

75
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,635
How'd you get in here?

76
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:11,878
Hiya, Paul.

77
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:14,378
I stood at the back door shouting and shouting.

78
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:16,337
- Were you in the little boys' room?
- I'm calling the police.

79
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:17,977
No need.
I just needed to borrow some flour.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,536
I'm a little bit psychic,

81
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:22,538
and I predict fresh-baked
cookies in your future.

82
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:24,537
Zachary.

83
00:04:24,573 --> 00:04:26,108
What'd she want?

84
00:04:26,143 --> 00:04:27,777
She was in the cupboard.

85
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,277
Get a trash bag.
We're throwing everything away.

86
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,536
You think she was trying to poison us?

87
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:37,047
All I know is we're eating out tonight.

88
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:43,638
What do you want?

89
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:47,776
Uh... this is a little awkward, and I apologize in advance

90
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:52,076
for how this is gonna sound, but, um...

91
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:56,347
By any chance, did... you burn down my house?

92
00:04:56,373 --> 00:04:58,635
Yes.

93
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:03,106
- What?
- Yes, I burnt down your house,
you sleazy little whore.

94
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:06,305
Edie! Why would you do that?!

95
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:07,806
Can you blame me,

96
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:10,977
after sending me that acid letter?

97
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:13,206
Letter? What letter?

98
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,208
The one where you admitted to
stabbing me in the back

99
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,906
by sleeping with Karl.

100
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:19,535
You weren't supposed to get that.

101
00:05:19,573 --> 00:05:21,537
I  stole that back from the mailman.

102
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,877
So you were trying
to hide the truth from me?

103
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:27,138
This is not what we should
focus on right now.

104
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:30,037
The point is, you maliciously
set fire to my house.

105
00:05:30,073 --> 00:05:33,476
Look, I admit I might have...
overreacted a tad.

106
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,477
A tad? Edie, I have no roof!

107
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,975
You can't just go around
burning down people's homes.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,208
Why not? You burnt down my home.

109
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,075
You  stole Mike from me.
You slept with my fiancé.

110
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:45,578
That's the trifecta.

111
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:47,575
You're lucky I didn't torch your car.

112
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,578
That's it. I'm going to the police,

113
00:05:49,603 --> 00:05:51,635
and I'm telling them what you did.

114
00:05:51,673 --> 00:05:53,976
Did what? I didn't do anything.

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,535
What? You just confessed.

116
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,038
No, I didn't.

117
00:05:58,073 --> 00:06:01,137
Did anyone else hear me confess?

118
00:06:01,172 --> 00:06:02,636
Hello?

119
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:04,376
Hello?

120
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:06,445
No witnesses.

121
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:10,075
No evidence, no confession.

122
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:12,008
I guess we're done here.

123
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:14,008
You can go home now.

124
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,505
Oh, wait. That's right.

125
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,377
You don't have one.

126
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:29,345
No, no, Xiao-Mei,
I've told you a million times.

127
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:31,346
No red meat for Mr. Solis.

128
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:33,238
My triglycerides are through the roof.

129
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:36,175
Mm. Sweetie, I need some more cream.

130
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,105
Xiao-Mei, what's wrong?

131
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:49,078
She smell.

132
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,636
Who smells? Gaby?

133
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:52,706
Excuse me. What?

134
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:56,407
Her perfume... make me sick.

135
00:06:56,443 --> 00:06:58,608
Honey, it's 100 bucks an ounce.

136
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,038
That tends to make everyone
a little nauseous.

137
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,038
Xiao-Mei, your boobs...
are they tender?

138
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:05,938
Mm-hmm.

139
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:08,706
Carlos! Her boobs are
none of your business.

140
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,808
Gaby, think. She's sensitive to smell,

141
00:07:11,843 --> 00:07:14,446
nauseous and has swollen breasts.

142
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:28,736
Well, I just ran her blood work.

143
00:07:28,771 --> 00:07:31,506
It looks like the insemination was successful.

144
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,509
Oh!

145
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:35,000
Oh, my God. We're gonna have a baby!

146
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:36,571
Now, you should know,

147
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,575
since she's experiencing early symptoms,

148
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,777
this might be a tough pregnancy for her.

149
00:07:40,802 --> 00:07:43,345
Not a problem.
We are gonna treat her like a queen!

150
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:46,475
Absolutely. You have nothing
to worry about here.

151
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,637
Oh, Mrs. Solis, you smell.

152
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,778
Oh, yeah. Okay. Sorry.

153
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,476
I think it's gonna be a kick

154
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,477
having Susan and Julie stay with us.

155
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:05,348
It'll be like living in a sorority.

156
00:08:05,373 --> 00:08:08,445
We'll stay up late
and we'll gossip and make smors.

157
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:10,778
Doesn't that sound like fun?

158
00:08:10,803 --> 00:08:14,475
Why are you pretending to be happy?

159
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,475
I heard you walking
around your room all night long...

160
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,706
c rying.

161
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,978
I don't want to talk about it.

162
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,978
Look, I know why you're worried,

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,408
but Andrew can take care of himself,
and if he can't,

164
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:29,908
he shouldn't have run away
in the first place.

165
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:32,978
You know what?
Maybe Andrew leaving will be good for us.

166
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:36,237
You are all I have left, and I am gonna be

167
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:38,808
the best mother that I can be.

168
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,677
There's definitely room for improvement.

169
00:08:42,072 --> 00:08:44,978
It's just...

170
00:08:45,003 --> 00:08:47,678
You kinda forgot my birthday.

171
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:50,137
What?

172
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:53,406
Yeah. It was six weeks ago.

173
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,005
Oh, my God, Danielle. I am so sorry.

174
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:59,705
It's okay. You had a lot going on.

175
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:01,636
I mean, Andrew was suing you,

176
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:04,105
and you were pretty wasted that month.

177
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:07,106
Honey, you've gotta let me
make it up to you.

178
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:09,108
I-I'm gonna throw you a birthday party

179
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:11,108
with all your friends, okay?

180
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,345
That could be cool.

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,875
You know what else I'd like?

182
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:18,507
Name it. It's yours.

183
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,836
I want Andrew's room.

184
00:09:22,631 --> 00:09:24,608
You said he's probably not coming back,

185
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,877
and I could really use
the extra closet space.

186
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,445
But, sweetheart, this is...
this is his room.

187
00:09:30,473 --> 00:09:33,107
Mom, you forgot my birthday.

188
00:09:33,132 --> 00:09:35,638
You're really in no position to negotiate.

189
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,607
Honey, where am I gonna put
all of his things?

190
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:41,608
And, you know, he might
come back at some point.

191
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:43,778
He won't.

192
00:09:43,803 --> 00:09:47,705
Like you said, I'm all you have left.

193
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:52,237
Atlantic City?

194
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:53,737
Yeah, it's last minute,

195
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:55,907
but Jerry got a great deal
on a suite at one of the casinos,

196
00:09:55,932 --> 00:09:58,906
and a bunch of the old gang
is coming in from New York,

197
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,905
and God, it's been forever since I have been,

198
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,776
so how could I turn that down?

199
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,375
Yeah, how, indeed?

200
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,407
What?

201
00:10:06,442 --> 00:10:08,677
I didn't say anything.

202
00:10:08,703 --> 00:10:10,737
No, but you have that look.

203
00:10:10,772 --> 00:10:12,448
Is something wrong?

204
00:10:12,472 --> 00:10:14,735
No!

205
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,537
Except that I know
you've been to Atlantic City

206
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,935
three times in the last month
without telling me.

207
00:10:22,972 --> 00:10:25,936
Ed found the receipts
when he did the office audit.

208
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,907
Other than that, no, nothing's wrong.

209
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,675
Tom, it would be better
for your general well-being

210
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:34,007
if you did not laugh
at this moment in time.

211
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,007
Am I gonna have to ruin the surprise?

212
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:38,078
Because it's a really good surprise.

213
00:10:38,103 --> 00:10:40,177
I'm thinking, yeah, ruin it.

214
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:42,677
I have been going to
Atlantic City for business.

215
00:10:42,703 --> 00:10:44,805
I am up for a top spot with Jerry's firm,

216
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,036
Huffington Promotions.

217
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,075
And if you don't believe me...

218
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:55,208
you can call the CEO himself.

219
00:10:55,233 --> 00:11:01,137
I am so happy and I'm so relieved.

220
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:04,105
Did you think I was cheating?

221
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,475
- No! Absolutely not.
- Lynette.

222
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:08,345
No! Okay, a little bit.

223
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,836
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

224
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,377
Ed found receipts for flowers
and theater tickets.

225
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:16,805
- I mean, by the way, did you...
- Jerry and I went to a show,

226
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,348
and the flowers were for Milt's wife.

227
00:11:19,371 --> 00:11:22,207
I knew that.
You didn't have to tell me that.

228
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:24,636
- Why did you buy flowers for Milt's wife?
- Lynette...

229
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:28,536
Sorry. Stop. Done talking.
That's fantastic.

230
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,578
I love you!

231
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:32,008
I love you.

232
00:11:48,302 --> 00:11:49,708
Carlos...

233
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:54,176
What's going on?

234
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,008
Xiao-Mei is feeling under the weather,

235
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:58,706
so I took up the vacuuming.

236
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:00,706
Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that.

237
00:12:00,732 --> 00:12:02,777
So, uh, did you move my beauty products?

238
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:05,808
They're not in the bathroom.

239
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,336
Why in the hell?

240
00:12:08,372 --> 00:12:12,205
I  forgot to tell you.
Uh, you can't use that stuff anymore.

241
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:15,507
It really triggers
Xiao-Mei's morning sickness.

242
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:19,208
All of it? Even my hair pomade?

243
00:12:19,231 --> 00:12:22,338
- Gives me stomachache.
- Yeah, well, it gives me volume,

244
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:24,975
so I guess we're both
gonna have a problem.

245
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,378
Do you have to be so high-maintenance?

246
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,578
You're not a model, Carlos.
Maintenance is my only skill.

247
00:12:30,603 --> 00:12:32,846
Please, no fight.

248
00:12:32,873 --> 00:12:36,377
If Mrs. Solis smell bad, I be okay.

249
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:43,105
Fine. I'll learn to live without product.

250
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,606
But when my hair starts smelling like hair,

251
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,638
I don't wanna hear a word.

252
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:53,237
Surprise!

253
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,178
What the hell is that?

254
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,778
Isn't it darling? I made it for your party.

255
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,775
It's a big "1" and a big "7"...

256
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,948
For "17."

257
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:04,845
Were you up all night making that thing?

258
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:06,535
Yeah. I just wasn't tired.

259
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:09,038
Oh, I wanna show you
what else I've planned.

260
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:11,235
I think you're gonna love it.

261
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,738
You got a fajita bar and a juggler?

262
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:15,378
No, relax. He's a very hip juggler.

263
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:17,507
He only performs to Beatles songs,

264
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:20,008
and I saw the video,
and it's absolutely thrilling.

265
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,337
Mom, I don't want any of this stuff.

266
00:13:22,372 --> 00:13:25,878
- It's not even my real birthday.
- Danielle, I just want you to have the best party

267
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:27,908
you have ever had in your entire life.

268
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:30,576
I just want a few friends
to come over and hang out.

269
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,308
You can make a cake,

270
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,806
but giant balloon numbers?

271
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,105
I mean, come on.
They would all make fun of me.

272
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,436
Oh.

273
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:44,677
Okay.

274
00:13:51,572 --> 00:13:53,305
Is that really necessary?

275
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:56,677
Honey, I can't possibly
put it in the garbage as is.

276
00:14:01,772 --> 00:14:04,338
It's just another morning
with the Van De Kamps.

277
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:06,605
Oh, Susan, did I wake you?

278
00:14:06,631 --> 00:14:09,135
Uh, no. No, I was up.

279
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:11,135
Well, I'm sorry about the noise.

280
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,636
It's just that Danielle doesn't want balloons,

281
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:15,636
and I'm kind of pressed for time.

282
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:20,108
Bree... are you okay?

283
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:24,106
She said she doesn't want balloons.

284
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:26,975
I'm fine.

285
00:14:37,153 --> 00:14:39,228
Mom?

286
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,127
Look, I know you're out there.
Please, just talk to me.

287
00:14:43,153 --> 00:14:45,587
Mom, I need something to drink.

288
00:14:45,622 --> 00:14:48,686
Just some water, some juice.
Something, anything. Please.

289
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,725
M om!

290
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:58,455
You want me to say that I set Caleb up?

291
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:01,857
Yeah, I did it.

292
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,987
I started thinking about all those years.

293
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:09,126
Years that we had to take care of him, and...

294
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:11,756
I just thought maybe once he was gone,

295
00:15:11,783 --> 00:15:14,098
we could have a normal life.

296
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:17,787
And I'm sorry.

297
00:15:17,822 --> 00:15:21,287
But, mom, you have got
to let me out of here now.

298
00:15:21,323 --> 00:15:24,586
Damn you!

299
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,585
You were willing to stand by

300
00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:30,427
and let me murder
your brother without reason.

301
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:33,126
That's an unforgivable betrayal.

302
00:15:33,153 --> 00:15:35,955
I am so consumed with rage,

303
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:38,957
it's best you stay in there,
because if I let you out

304
00:15:38,983 --> 00:15:43,288
I don't know what I might do to you.

305
00:15:51,922 --> 00:15:53,285
Hello?

306
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,288
I need Edie to spill her guts.

307
00:15:55,323 --> 00:15:57,256
What do you know about wearing a wire?

308
00:15:58,621 --> 00:16:00,486
- So you see the little red light?
- Mmh.

309
00:16:00,522 --> 00:16:01,987
It's all voice-activated,

310
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:03,985
so if the light's on, you're recording.

311
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:06,488
Uh,  let me show you how to tape it on.

312
00:16:06,523 --> 00:16:08,328
Oh, okay.

313
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,328
Sorry if my hands are cold.

314
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:14,328
Um... no, that's okay. They're fine.

315
00:16:18,582 --> 00:16:21,126
So you sure you wanna do this?

316
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:23,288
Yeah. I'm sort of up against the wall.

317
00:16:23,323 --> 00:16:25,285
The insurance company needs proof fast,

318
00:16:25,321 --> 00:16:27,786
and things are sort of weird at Bree's.

319
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,155
I don't wanna overstay my welcome.

320
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:35,127
Well, if things get tough,
you can always stay here.

321
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:36,725
Testing, testing.

322
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:40,958
I'm sorry. Did you just invite me
to move in with you?

323
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:43,526
Well, you and Julie in the spare bedroom.

324
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,686
Oh.

325
00:16:44,722 --> 00:16:46,555
You've...

326
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,586
You've been saying
how you want to be friends again,

327
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:51,096
and you're right.

328
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:54,588
There's no reason we can't be friends.

329
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:58,197
You sure that won't put a crimp
in your, uh, dating life?

330
00:16:58,222 --> 00:17:01,928
You know, that girl you were
at the movies with?

331
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:03,585
No. That was a one-time thing.

332
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:06,885
But what about that guy, though?
Orson.

333
00:17:06,922 --> 00:17:11,227
Yeah, he just heard about the fire
and came over to help. We're friends.

334
00:17:12,091 --> 00:17:15,385
Oh. So... neither of us is dating anybody.

335
00:17:15,421 --> 00:17:17,688
Guess not.

336
00:17:21,252 --> 00:17:24,227
I got my boarding pass.

337
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,057
Do what you need to do
and don't worry about the kids.

338
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:29,055
I'll keep 'em out of trouble.

339
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:30,556
Is this crazy?

340
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,858
Following Tom across the country
just to spy on him?

341
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:34,855
If he knew I was doing this...

342
00:17:34,882 --> 00:17:37,727
God, I don't think
I can go through with this.

343
00:17:37,753 --> 00:17:39,757
Now, look, there's probably nothing going on,

344
00:17:39,782 --> 00:17:42,725
but you need to know the truth.

345
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:44,227
Do I? I'm happy.

346
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:47,096
I mean, I was.
Why don't I just look the other way

347
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,095
and pretend nothing's wrong?
Lots of women can do that.

348
00:17:50,122 --> 00:17:52,125
But we both know
you're not one of them.

349
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:55,785
And what if I see him
with another woman? What then?

350
00:17:58,451 --> 00:18:00,785
I own a gun.

351
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,526
You okay here?

352
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:21,055
I'm fine. Why?

353
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:23,758
It's just, people have been
asking about the cake,

354
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:26,056
and you've been icing it
for over an hour.

355
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:28,056
Well, I just keep messing it up.

356
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,256
I don't know what's wrong with me.

357
00:18:30,282 --> 00:18:31,758
You're probably just tired.

358
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:34,226
My mom and I heard you up all night.

359
00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:37,158
It just keeps coming out too thick.

360
00:18:40,282 --> 00:18:44,857
You know, people aren't gonna care
if the icing isn't perfect.

361
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:49,257
People care about details.

362
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,685
Someday when Danielle looks back,

363
00:18:51,721 --> 00:18:54,786
I want her to remember
just how perfect her cake looked

364
00:18:54,821 --> 00:18:57,685
and how hard her mother worked
to make her happy.

365
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,726
This cake is a symbol of my love.

366
00:19:02,622 --> 00:19:07,185
Well, it looks delicious.

367
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:17,257
# Happy birthday to you,
# happy birthday to you.

368
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,325
# Happy birthday, dear Danielle...

369
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,757
Stop! One of the candles went out.

370
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:28,755
Um, we're gonna have
to do this all over again.

371
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:30,756
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

372
00:19:30,781 --> 00:19:33,087
- Mom, it's all right.
- Sweetheart, this is your special day.

373
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:35,658
All of your candles should be lit.

374
00:19:35,682 --> 00:19:38,055
It'll just take me two seconds.

375
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:39,557
Is she serious?

376
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,885
Welcome to my own private hell.

377
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,497
That is some serious frosting.

378
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,328
All righty.

379
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:09,028
Who touched this?

380
00:20:09,053 --> 00:20:11,286
Mom, what is the matter?
It's just a little frosting.

381
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:13,037
Somebody ruined your cake,

382
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,935
and I wanna know
who could be that thoughtless.

383
00:20:15,971 --> 00:20:18,707
Was it you? Or you?!
Who was it?

384
00:20:18,742 --> 00:20:20,776
Mom, please, you're embarrassing me.

385
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:24,307
You. You look like a girl
who enjoys her frosting.

386
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:27,375
No! No, I didn't touch it.

387
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,576
It's just a cake, for God's sake.
Will you please just cut it?

388
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:32,076
Mrs. Van De Kamp...

389
00:20:32,102 --> 00:20:34,277
Open your mouth.
I wanna smell your breath.

390
00:20:34,303 --> 00:20:36,308
It wasn't me! It was Barbie.

391
00:20:36,332 --> 00:20:37,808
Barbie!

392
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,236
What the hell is wrong with you?!

393
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,778
Now it's ruined! Everything is ruined!

394
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:57,037
Um...

395
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:59,276
You can just... leave that there,

396
00:20:59,302 --> 00:21:03,575
and I'll, um... clean it up later.

397
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,535
Xiao-Mei, what are you doing in our bed?

398
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,535
I said she could sleep in there from now on.

399
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,907
It's got the bathroom.
You know, in case

400
00:21:17,932 --> 00:21:20,235
she gets sick in the middle of the night.

401
00:21:20,271 --> 00:21:23,006
- Well, what's wrong with the guest bathroom?
- It's too far away.

402
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,936
- It's right down the hall.
- Gaby, she needs her rest.

403
00:21:25,971 --> 00:21:30,275
And besides, that bed is much more comfortable
than the one in the guest room.

404
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:31,776
Yeah, I know.

405
00:21:31,803 --> 00:21:35,206
That's why I had the movers
put it in here, where we sleep.

406
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:38,707
Maybe I go to my bed.

407
00:21:38,742 --> 00:21:41,006
Yes, Xiao-Mei, that would be good.

408
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:43,748
Uh-Oh.

409
00:21:47,132 --> 00:21:50,778
Fine. You can use our toilet.

410
00:21:56,702 --> 00:21:58,177
Ow! Stop kicking me.

411
00:21:58,203 --> 00:22:00,175
I'm just trying to get comfortable.

412
00:22:00,201 --> 00:22:03,578
Yeah, in a twin? Good luck.

413
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,536
God, I want my bed back.

414
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:09,037
We'll go buy a nice big one tomorrow

415
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:12,307
- and put it in here, okay?
- That is not the point.
We are a week into this pregnancy,

416
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,307
and you're already putting
Xiao-Mei's needs before mine.

417
00:22:15,331 --> 00:22:18,676
Well, she's the priority now.
She's the mother of my child.

418
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:23,337
Like hell she is. That is my egg.

419
00:22:23,372 --> 00:22:27,537
- You know what I mean. She's the...
- Oven, Carlos. The oven.

420
00:22:27,572 --> 00:22:29,508
A well-cared for, well-paid oven.

421
00:22:29,532 --> 00:22:31,506
It came out wrong. I'm sorry, okay?

422
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:34,275
Now can we just get some sleep?

423
00:22:36,803 --> 00:22:38,906
Ohh! Babe, I'm sorry.

424
00:22:38,931 --> 00:22:40,938
I swear. I swear I didn't mean to.

425
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,678
My leg just cramped up.

426
00:22:43,702 --> 00:22:46,177
Where are you going?
That's my pillow!

427
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,407
Good night.

428
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:56,008
Matthew!

429
00:23:13,072 --> 00:23:14,906
Mom, come on.

430
00:23:14,931 --> 00:23:17,408
Oh, my God. What are you doing in there?

431
00:23:17,432 --> 00:23:18,907
Danielle, is that you?

432
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,908
My mom found out what we did to Caleb.

433
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:24,037
- She flipped out and locked me in here.
- Don't worry. I'll get you out.

434
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:25,537
Be really careful, okay?
Please, okay?

435
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:27,706
I've never seen her like this before.

436
00:23:27,732 --> 00:23:29,705
She's seriously lost it this time.

437
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,207
I know a little something about psycho moms.

438
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:34,776
Trust me, I'll be fine.

439
00:23:41,802 --> 00:23:43,306
Hey.

440
00:23:43,331 --> 00:23:46,336
Cleaning up after the big party?

441
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:49,036
Yeah.

442
00:23:51,372 --> 00:23:52,836
You know, it's late.

443
00:23:52,872 --> 00:23:55,505
Why don't you, uh, go to bed
and, you know,

444
00:23:55,532 --> 00:23:58,508
let Julie and I help you
with that in the morning?

445
00:23:58,531 --> 00:24:02,005
Oh, that's okay. I can't sleep anyway.

446
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:04,747
Are you... okay?

447
00:24:04,772 --> 00:24:07,477
I take it you heard what happened.

448
00:24:07,501 --> 00:24:10,778
Yeah, when you flip out
in front of the pep squad,

449
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:13,648
word travels fast.

450
00:24:13,673 --> 00:24:15,838
It was the oddest sensation.

451
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:18,535
I was fine, and everything was fine,

452
00:24:18,572 --> 00:24:22,377
and then suddenly
I was on the outside of my body

453
00:24:22,402 --> 00:24:25,677
watching a woman who looked like me

454
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:28,106
becoming a raving maniac.

455
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,275
Bree, I'm worried about you.

456
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:33,775
- Do you think that you should see someone?
- Oh, no, I'm fine.

457
00:24:33,801 --> 00:24:37,177
I'm just tired, that's all.
I just need a long rest,

458
00:24:37,203 --> 00:24:39,677
and then I'm gonna be as good as new.

459
00:24:39,703 --> 00:24:44,335
Okay, well, then why don't you stop
and go to bed?

460
00:24:44,371 --> 00:24:48,376
Because, um, I can't sleep just yet.

461
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,877
Why not?

462
00:24:49,901 --> 00:24:51,306
Because when I sleep, I dream,

463
00:24:51,332 --> 00:24:55,207
and when I dream, I keep seeing
Andrew's face in that rearview mirror.

464
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:58,078
Okay, what are you talking about?

465
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,745
Andrew, um...

466
00:25:01,772 --> 00:25:03,306
didn't run away.

467
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:12,107
I, um, dropped him off
in the middle of nowhere,

468
00:25:12,132 --> 00:25:14,605
told him that I couldn't
be around him anymore,

469
00:25:14,642 --> 00:25:17,105
and then...

470
00:25:17,131 --> 00:25:18,648
I drove off.

471
00:25:24,202 --> 00:25:27,177
So I just need a little time
to forget what I've done,

472
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:30,235
and then I can sleep again.

473
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,647
Hey.

474
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,748
You know, I am not even tired.

475
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:47,237
So... why don't I stay up
and help you?

476
00:25:48,571 --> 00:25:50,408
That would be nice.

477
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:24,077
Hello?

478
00:26:24,102 --> 00:26:26,706
Hey, you. How you doing?

479
00:26:26,742 --> 00:26:29,037
Hey! Great.

480
00:26:29,072 --> 00:26:33,807
Great. How's Atlantic City?
Are you, um, winning some money?

481
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,338
Oh, I'm about even.

482
00:26:35,372 --> 00:26:37,807
Actually, I'm heading back
into the casino right now

483
00:26:37,842 --> 00:26:39,377
- to try my luck again.
- Yeah?

484
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,176
You're quite a gambler.

485
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:44,747
Where's Jerry?

486
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:47,677
Uh, Jerry?

487
00:26:47,702 --> 00:26:50,605
He-he's right here.
Hey, honey, how are the kids?

488
00:26:50,633 --> 00:26:53,108
Great. Great.
They're in the day care room.

489
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:56,206
I'm... looking at 'em right now.

490
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:58,507
Hey, why don't you
walk in there and, um,

491
00:26:58,532 --> 00:27:01,506
put 'em on the phone with me
so I can say hi?

492
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:03,135
Okay. Sure.

493
00:27:03,173 --> 00:27:05,375
First, can I talk to Jerry?

494
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,607
Why do you wanna talk to Jerry?

495
00:27:07,632 --> 00:27:10,706
Well, just, you know, say hello.
It's been a long time.

496
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:18,775
Wow, man, that is weird.

497
00:27:18,801 --> 00:27:21,275
Can you hear--
do you hear that car alarm?

498
00:27:21,301 --> 00:27:24,107
Uh... no.

499
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:29,377
It's strange, because I can hear it here
and through the phone.

500
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:32,278
Whoa. That's weird
kind of feedback, you know?

501
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,275
Physics can be spooky that way.

502
00:27:34,301 --> 00:27:36,277
Listen, I gotta go. I gotta go.

503
00:27:36,302 --> 00:27:38,307
Ed is talking to me, and, um,

504
00:27:38,331 --> 00:27:40,308
I'll call you back later?

505
00:27:40,331 --> 00:27:41,338
Um, okay.

506
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:43,136
Okay, bye.

507
00:27:43,172 --> 00:27:44,538
Bye, honey.

508
00:27:57,702 --> 00:27:59,677
9-1-1. Is this an emergency?

509
00:27:59,701 --> 00:28:01,177
I think so.

510
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,476
My neighbor, Paul Young,
has been threatening me.

511
00:28:04,503 --> 00:28:05,675
Is he there right now?

512
00:28:05,702 --> 00:28:06,877
No.

513
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:10,908
Ma'am, until he actually does
something, there's nothing we can do.

514
00:28:10,942 --> 00:28:12,907
Well, I won't live in fear anymore.

515
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,905
If you people refuse to confront him,

516
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:17,508
I guess I'll just have to do it myself.

517
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:40,636
No, Edie, wait.
Um, I don't wanna fight.

518
00:28:40,673 --> 00:28:42,637
I know that we've had our differences,

519
00:28:42,671 --> 00:28:44,805
but, you know,
we had a friendship going there,

520
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,305
and I just think we owe it to ourselves
to talk about what happened.

521
00:28:49,332 --> 00:28:52,577
What's there to talk about?
It happened.

522
00:28:52,603 --> 00:28:54,578
I walked down to your house,

523
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:57,137
- I had a watering can...
- What?

524
00:28:57,172 --> 00:28:59,308
- filled it with gasoline and...

525
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,035
Boom! Laughed my ass off.

526
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:04,506
Okay, wait.
Could you just swallow?

527
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:06,206
'Cause I couldn't really...
what you were saying...

528
00:29:06,232 --> 00:29:07,747
And that was basically it.

529
00:29:07,772 --> 00:29:09,537
One of the best days of my life.

530
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,537
Well, see, you were chewing,

531
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,908
and so I didn't really hear what you said.

532
00:29:13,933 --> 00:29:15,907
Could you just say it again?

533
00:29:15,932 --> 00:29:18,935
I burnt your house down.
It was great. What do you want?

534
00:29:18,971 --> 00:29:20,937
So, uh, y-you then a-admit

535
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:25,035
burning down my house on purpose?

536
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,336
You're wearing a wire, aren't you?

537
00:29:34,371 --> 00:29:35,575
Huh?

538
00:29:35,603 --> 00:29:38,238
- Open that blouse.
- What? No.

539
00:29:38,273 --> 00:29:39,907
Open that blouse!

540
00:29:39,932 --> 00:29:41,676
Aah!

541
00:29:42,842 --> 00:29:44,805
You can't outrun me, Mayer!

542
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,938
I'm in the best shape of my life!

543
00:29:46,973 --> 00:29:49,507
Well, good, then you'll be
prime meat picking

544
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:51,236
- when you go to jail!
- You give it!

545
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:52,777
Bite me!

546
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:57,878
Aha!

547
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,938
No! No!

548
00:29:59,973 --> 00:30:02,746
Ow!

549
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,075
What the hell?

550
00:31:48,321 --> 00:31:54,225
Nine months of long nights
on the couch loomed before Gabrielle.

551
00:31:55,792 --> 00:32:00,628
And she had decided
she would not take it lying down.

552
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,997
So she dipped into her
supply of forbidden perfumes...

553
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:10,426
determined that in this battle...

554
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:15,168
she would be the one
to come out smelling like a rose.

555
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,865
I think I take nap now.

556
00:32:18,891 --> 00:32:21,465
Yeah, sure, knock yourself out.

557
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,527
Aah!

558
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:41,137
Honey?

559
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:48,137
Boys?

560
00:32:51,461 --> 00:32:53,666
Anybody home?

561
00:32:56,661 --> 00:32:58,726
Hey, Mrs. McCluskey, excuse me.

562
00:32:58,763 --> 00:33:01,926
You haven't seen Lynette around, have you?

563
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,926
She's not home.
She's not answering her cell phone.

564
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:07,098
She packed up the kids
and the puppy and left.

565
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,595
Packed 'em up? Why?

566
00:33:08,623 --> 00:33:10,895
She followed you to Atlantic City.

567
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,427
She knows about your other woman.

568
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,797
Boy, you're just lucky
you're not my husband.

569
00:33:25,322 --> 00:33:26,795
Hi.

570
00:33:36,032 --> 00:33:37,998
Okay, first, let me say,

571
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,468
I'm really sorry about the yellowjackets.

572
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,698
And... also, no matter how mad
I am about what you did,

573
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,297
I don't want to see you go to prison.

574
00:33:48,322 --> 00:33:51,827
So I came with a solution.

575
00:33:51,862 --> 00:33:54,826
Why don't you just come forward
and tell the police

576
00:33:54,861 --> 00:34:00,496
that you saw some vagrant lurking
by my garage with a can of gasoline?

577
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:05,136
And if you do that,
then I'll destroy the tape.

578
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,795
And then the insurance company
will pay the claim.

579
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,395
Nobody gets hurt.

580
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,597
Does that sound good?

581
00:34:13,492 --> 00:34:15,038
Come closer.

582
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:17,038
Oh, uh...

583
00:34:23,593 --> 00:34:26,565
Take your stinking deal and shove it.

584
00:34:26,593 --> 00:34:28,226
Edie...

585
00:34:28,261 --> 00:34:32,228
Every time something bad happens
to me, you're standing nearby.

586
00:34:32,261 --> 00:34:34,566
Well, I've had it.

587
00:34:34,593 --> 00:34:36,567
No more pretending to be friends.

588
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:39,666
When I get outta here,
I'm gonna destroy you.

589
00:34:39,693 --> 00:34:43,867
Okay, I'm just gonna think
that this is the meds talking,

590
00:34:43,893 --> 00:34:46,598
and I'll come back tomorrow.

591
00:34:46,623 --> 00:34:48,696
Don't bother.

592
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,068
Okay, Edie, I'm in trouble here.

593
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:53,567
Oh, I'm sure you'll turn on
the waterworks,

594
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,566
and the whole neighborhood
will come running.

595
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,066
They always do.

596
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,525
- That's not true.
- Sure, it is.

597
00:34:59,562 --> 00:35:02,568
You never miss an opportunity
to play the victim.

598
00:35:02,591 --> 00:35:07,667
And you think just because everybody
always comes to your rescue,

599
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,768
it means that you're loved.

600
00:35:09,793 --> 00:35:11,725
Well, it doesn't.

601
00:35:11,763 --> 00:35:15,136
It means that you're helpless.

602
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,725
Now get out.

603
00:35:17,761 --> 00:35:19,897
Just get out.

604
00:35:28,922 --> 00:35:30,425
Hey there.

605
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,367
Hi.

606
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:35,695
So, you've given any thought
to staying at my place?

607
00:35:35,722 --> 00:35:39,426
Oh, yeah, that. Um...

608
00:35:39,463 --> 00:35:41,468
Look, I really appreciate the offer,

609
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:43,668
but I think I'm gonna have to pass.

610
00:35:43,691 --> 00:35:45,398
- Really?
- Yeah.

611
00:35:45,423 --> 00:35:47,995
I think it's best.
I don't wanna get a rep around here

612
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,996
for being a charity case, you know?

613
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:51,996
Well, I didn't mean it that way.

614
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,298
Just one friend helping out another.

615
00:35:54,322 --> 00:35:58,565
I know, but I can figure this out
on my own.

616
00:35:58,593 --> 00:36:00,695
At least I'm gonna try.

617
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:05,797
You know, I'm stronger
than people give me credit for.

618
00:36:05,822 --> 00:36:07,295
I really am.

619
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:10,465
Well, if there's anything I can do...

620
00:36:10,492 --> 00:36:14,427
You know what would be nice?

621
00:36:14,461 --> 00:36:17,866
Why don't you just stop over
for coffee sometime?

622
00:36:17,891 --> 00:36:19,528
Okay.

623
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:21,528
I mean, that is after I get

624
00:36:21,563 --> 00:36:23,526
running water and electricity again.

625
00:36:23,562 --> 00:36:25,528
And a coffeemaker.

626
00:36:32,562 --> 00:36:35,427
I hope you're happy.
That poor girl can hardly even

627
00:36:35,462 --> 00:36:37,925
come upstairs now because of you.

628
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:41,167
Carlos, stop with the dance.
It's already in the wallpaper.

629
00:36:41,193 --> 00:36:44,625
Now I swear, if anything happens
to that kid because of you...

630
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:46,825
Oh, it's perfume, not toxic gas.

631
00:36:46,863 --> 00:36:48,568
Why are you acting this way?

632
00:36:48,591 --> 00:36:52,697
Because I see the writing on the wall,
and it scares the hell out of me.

633
00:36:52,723 --> 00:36:54,166
Meaning what?

634
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:55,167
From the second Xiao-Mei got pregnant,

635
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:58,396
you have found a million and one ways
to tell me that

636
00:36:58,423 --> 00:37:01,135
- that baby is more important to you than me.
- Oh, come on, Gaby.

637
00:37:01,161 --> 00:37:03,136
No! Men can't help it.

638
00:37:03,163 --> 00:37:05,467
When they become fathers,
they become lousy husbands.

639
00:37:05,493 --> 00:37:06,996
And some wives don't mind,

640
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,995
but you didn't marry one of those women.

641
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:12,495
I don't think I can sleep in here tonight.

642
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:14,765
The air's just a little too toxic.

643
00:37:23,723 --> 00:37:26,897
She kick you out, too?

644
00:37:26,921 --> 00:37:28,898
Marriage is complicated, Xiao-Mei.

645
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:31,096
You'll find that out someday.

646
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:35,166
You feel like watching
some trashy American TV?

647
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,428
I make you sandwich.

648
00:37:39,461 --> 00:37:41,368
Roast beef.

649
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,165
Oh, man.

650
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,495
Gaby's got me on this health kick thing.

651
00:37:45,522 --> 00:37:47,498
She'll kill me if I eat red meat.

652
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,898
I will not tell.

653
00:37:58,962 --> 00:38:00,396
Taste good?

654
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:03,996
Real good.

655
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:09,797
Matthew, wake up.
I have your breakfast.

656
00:38:09,822 --> 00:38:14,525
I might be furious with you,
but never let it be said that I'm cruel.

657
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,225
I advise you not to charge this door,

658
00:38:18,261 --> 00:38:23,137
because I am not in the mood
for any unpleasantness.

659
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:28,395
Matthew?
Matthew!

660
00:38:28,422 --> 00:38:29,525
Aah!

661
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:38,627
Jeez, Danielle! I thought you were
just gonna steal the key.

662
00:38:38,663 --> 00:38:40,625
Let's just get out of here.

663
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:57,095
Mother, Matthew and I are running away
together and we're never coming back.

664
00:38:57,121 --> 00:39:01,967
If you want me to be happy,
you won't try to find us.

665
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,365
Living in that house with you
was like being in a prison.

666
00:39:05,392 --> 00:39:08,525
You drove me to do this,
so I hope you'll blame yourself.

667
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,898
Have a nice life. Danielle.

668
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:18,125
Hello.

669
00:39:18,162 --> 00:39:20,126
My name is Bree Van De Kamp,

670
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:23,268
and I'd like to admit myself
for psychiatric observation.

671
00:39:23,691 --> 00:39:26,167
All right,
what seems to be the problem?

672
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,797
I think I'm about to have
a nervous breakdown.

673
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,938
Damn it!

674
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,597
What the hell?

675
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:57,098
That psychotic bitch.

676
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:31,096
There was no confrontation.

677
00:40:31,122 --> 00:40:33,266
Felicia Tillman's the one
who made the call.

678
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:35,096
She's the anonymous tip.

679
00:40:35,122 --> 00:40:36,938
Let's just go over there right now.

680
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,396
I guarantee you, the woman is having
a cocktail, laughing her ass off.

681
00:40:41,423 --> 00:40:44,995
We're not going anywhere yet, sir.

682
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:48,327
Yes, I know there's blood everywhere.

683
00:40:48,361 --> 00:40:50,328
She probably got it from a pig

684
00:40:50,363 --> 00:40:53,428
so she can vandalize everything I own.

685
00:40:54,933 --> 00:40:56,366
Sergeant.

686
00:40:58,392 --> 00:40:59,328
What is it?

687
00:40:59,362 --> 00:41:02,225
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

688
00:41:08,493 --> 00:41:11,226
Oh, man, she's good.

689
00:41:14,093 --> 00:41:17,267
It's a shocking moment for each of us,

690
00:41:17,293 --> 00:41:22,026
that moment we realize
we are all alone in this world.

691
00:41:23,492 --> 00:41:28,297
The family we take for granted
could one day abandon us.

692
00:41:30,862 --> 00:41:36,326
The husband we trust so implicitly
might betray us.

693
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:44,366
The daughter we love so deeply
perhaps won't return to us.

694
00:41:44,393 --> 00:41:48,538
And then we could end up all by ourselves.

695
00:41:50,662 --> 00:41:56,126
Of course, some see great value
in going it alone.

696
00:41:56,162 --> 00:41:57,795
For example...

697
00:41:58,322 --> 00:42:00,297
Sorry about the dust, Mrs. Huber.

698
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,325
We don't get too many tourists
this far up the mountain.

00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,028
First snows come
and this place is completely cut off.

700
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,128
Dropping off the face of the earth,

701
00:42:09,162 --> 00:42:11,128
now that's what I call a vacation.

702
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,067
- I'm sorry.
- Oh.

703
00:42:18,882 --> 00:42:20,346
Sometimes I'm just all thumbs.
