00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,211
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...

2
00:00:02,246 --> 00:00:02,773
Hi, Maisy

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,100
Are you having an affair with my husband?

4
00:00:06,236 --> 00:00:07,979
Mistresses were confronted..

5
00:00:08,014 --> 00:00:08,939
Very good to be back

6
00:00:08,974 --> 00:00:09,397
What's that?

7
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,574
I'm on house arrest
It's a condition of my bail

8
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:12,300
How are you going to work?

9
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,600
I can't. I can't do anything

10
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,300
The tables were turned

11
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,900
Good lord, that's Angela

12
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,600
And secrets from the past

13
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,600
I'm afraid you're mistaken

14
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,200
My wife's name was mary alice

15
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,500
Caught up with everyone

16
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,800
I'm such an idiot
And you're such a liar

17
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,700
Oh, and apparently,
a killer

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,900
Throughout even the most respectable
 of neighborhoods,

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,600
you can hear the sound of scandal

20
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,700
Some scandals announce
themselves with a shout

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,000
Ida! Ida greenberg,
that is not your paper!

22
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,700
Some with a whisper

23
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,700
throw me a $20, and I'll hook you up
with free porn

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
And some with a bang

25
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,300
Get the hell off my lawn!

26
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,237
And once in a great while,
there comes a scandal so deliciously sordid,

27
00:01:10,272 --> 00:01:13,100
its roar drowns out all other noise

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,400
its roar drowns out
all other noise

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,000
So your husband -- does he have any idea how many men 
pay for the privilege of sleeping in this bed?

30
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,000
There's not a lot
of sleeping going on --

31
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,700
- not if I'm doing my job right
- Ha ha ha

32
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,000
So how do you want
to get started?

33
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,900
With these ?

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,500
Well ... that's going to cost you extra

35
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,000
Maisy gibbons, you're
under arrest for solicitation

36
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,200
What?

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,100
Please turn and place
your hands on the bed

38
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,800
I'm sorry I'm -- I'm going
to have to ask you to leave now

39
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,500
Hey! Aah! You get off me!

40
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,974
- This is entrapment
- Right

41
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
You all are making
a gigantic mistake

42
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah, yeah Hey, fellas,
here's one for your memoirs

43
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,900
- Come on
- No! No!

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,700
No, don't you touch me!

45
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,328
- Would you get your hands off me!
- Take it easy, mrs Gibbons

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,151
Yes, the scandalous arrest
of maisy gibbons

47
00:02:08,186 --> 00:02:12,100
would soon prove to be the shot 
heard 'round the world

48
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:53,969
Take it easy, ma'am

49
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:55,539
Don't you put me in here!

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,500
It is often said that good news 
travels fast,

51
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,600
but as every housewife knows,

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,300
bad news moves quite a bit faster

53
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,700
Tish? Hey, you are not going
to believe this

54
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,600
Maisy gibbons was arrested

55
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,400
- You cannot be serious
- Yes

56
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,700
- Hey, did you hear about maisy?
- I let my son spend the night at her house just last week
- She ...

57
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,100
Maisy gibbons running in handcuffs --
I'd have killed to see that

58
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,700
Stay put. I'll be right back

59
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,300
Ladies, please calm down, ma'am

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,900
This is just a precaution

61
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,400
If you'll just take a flyer

62
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,300
hey, guys. What's going on?

63
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,400
Oh, there's been
an outbreak of head lice

64
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,300
Head lice ?

65
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,900
These flyers detail all the important information 
concerning the situation,

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,600
including the recommended
delousing combs

67
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,100
Delousing? Do they have to
make it sound so disgusting?

68
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,400
Does anybody know
where it started?

69
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,600
I'm sorry
That's confidential information

70
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,600
Barcliff maintains
a strict no-blame policy

71
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,600
Hey, guys, over here

72
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,400
I think parents have a right to know

73
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,800
who brought this into our school

74
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,900
Please calm down, ma'am

75
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,300
Our position is that there's nothing 
to be gained by pointing fingers

76
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,900
To identify the child
who initiated the outbreak

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
might result in him or her
being subjected to ridicule

78
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,800
I, um, excuse me¡K¡K

79
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,300
- If you'll just take a flyer...
- stop scratching, stop scratching

80
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,300
Now, now, stop it

81
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,900
Guys, let's go, okay?
Stop scratching. I mean it Stop, stop

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,200
- Hey See you later
- Bye

83
00:04:23,548 --> 00:04:24,201
Glued into the hair shaft,
and can only be removed ...

84
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,600
What the hell?

85
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,800
- Gabrielle!
- What?

86
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,600
Hey, gabrielle, I think
we got a problem here!

87
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,600
I can't hear you!

88
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,400
I said, I think we got a problem!

89
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,200
- The water's backing up here!
- What?

90
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,836
- Is that sewage?
- Aah!

91
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,900
Yeah, that's sewage

92
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,100
So, uh, mike, the suspense is killing us

93
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,700
Why don't you
just tell us the bad news?

94
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,100
Well, your outtake pipe's completely corroded.
That's why it collapsed

95
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,800
I'm going to have to
tear it out and repipe the whole system

96
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,700
And how much
is this going to cost?

97
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,600
I'll do the job for you at cost,
but you're still looking at 6, 7 grand, minimum

98
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,800
Okay, well,
we'll let you know

99
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,900
Look, um ... if money's an issue

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
oh,  no, no, no,
it's not the money

101
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,100
It's just, uh, carlos and I are trying to prioritize 
some little things we need to do around the house

102
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,100
All right And, uh, you don't consider
sewage backing up in the house a priority?

103
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,700
It's definitely on the short list

104
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,500
I'm kind of surprised
you called me

105
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,300
Why?

106
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,900
Well, um, ever since my arrest,

107
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,100
nobody around here seems to want to 
have much to do with me

108
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,000
Innocent until proven guilty, my man

109
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,500
Hope he's more innocent
than you are

110
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,500
Hey,  it's lynette
I know you're down about this mike thing,

111
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,300
but you got to come to poker

112
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
It'll be worth it.
I got dirt on maisy gibbons

113
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,000
Hey, susan, it's me

114
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,700
I really wish you'd return my calls

115
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,190
We need to talk
I know I messed things --

116
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:26,900
you okay?

117
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,600
Hi

118
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,000
You know, I can stay home
if you want

119
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,700
No, no, no

120
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,600
Now, I know how much you were looking forward
 to this weekend with your dad

121
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,700
I'm fine

122
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,500
You don't look fine

123
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,300
Well ... a little sad

124
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,300
Mike and I were just a fling

125
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,400
And not even a full fling
Sort of a borderline fling

126
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,600
Mom, anyone can see
how much you loved him

127
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,632
Well, I also loved junk food,
and I gave that up, and I survived

128
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,100
There's your father
Go have fun

129
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,900
Last chance. You're sure?

130
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,800
I'm sure. Now go

131
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,900
You'll find someone else, mom

132
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,200
someone great. I know it

133
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,900
What's wrong, rex?

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,500
Didn't you enjoy your golf game with dr Wallace?

135
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,700
I didn't play
I'm still feeling sluggish

136
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,100
Still? Did you talk
to him about that?

137
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah, of course. He doesn't understand 
why the medication isn't working,

138
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,800
and he wants me to come in
for a checkup tomorrow

139
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,100
I can see that tish
is making the rounds

140
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,500
She must have
some juicy new anecdote

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,800
Yeah, get her over here

142
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,600
I could use a funny story today

143
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,100
Tish, Tish

144
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,900
Oh, I can tell by that look on your face 
you've got something good

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,400
Now, come on, don't be selfish

146
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,300
Well, first off,

147
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,100
you're not friends with maisy gibbons, are you?

148
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,900
No

149
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,000
Thank god,
because this is too good

150
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,400
Maisy was arrested

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,100
While harold was at work,

152
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,900
she was having sex with men
in her house for money

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,200
Can you imagine?

154
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
No, I can'T

155
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,000
And that's not even the best part

156
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,300
Word is she had a little black book 
with all her clients' names

157
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,100
So, uh... you think that'll get out?

158
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,900
Of course. These things always do

159
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,558
- Nancy, wait up. 
- I can't wait to tell you this. Wait, wait

160
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,800
Well, you heard
your funny story, rex

161
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,900
Why aren't you laughing?

162
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,200
I go get it

163
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,100
Hello

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,900
Hi, tami, yeah

165
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,800
- Can we see one of the bugs?
- Yeah, here. See?

166
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,200
It's this little white thing

167
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,900
Look... It looks like a -- aw, jeez

168
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,700
It looks like a sesame seed

169
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,800
That's cool

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah, well, there's lots more
where that came from

171
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,300
No, I'm -- I'm so sorry

172
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,800
He must be so disappointed

173
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,500
But, look, we'll get all the boys together
once topher's back on his feet

174
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,000
Bye

175
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,600
What'd tami want?

176
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,900
She's canceling
topher's birthday party on sunday

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,400
He's come down with the measles, so...

178
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,600
Measles, huh?

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah. What?

180
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,600
Tami brennan spent
a fortune on topher's party

181
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,100
She'd call in specialists from switzerland 
before she'd let it be canceled

182
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:50,800
Okay. Why would tami lie to us?

183
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,200
Because she saw porter scratching 
his head at school

184
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,800
They all did, and now word's getting around

185
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,800
Why is everything
a conspiracy theory with you?

186
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,800
Lots of kids get lice
They're not that big a deal

187
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,900
- Well, it is for the rich b-I-t-c-hs at barcliff academy
- Lynette

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,200
It's been one day, and they've been disinvited 
to a birthday party

189
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,600
If rumors start flying, these boys can kiss campouts
and pool parties goodbye

190
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,800
Uh-oh

191
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
Yeah, not so cool now, huh?

192
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,600
It's all here

193
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,500
Appraisal, title search,

194
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,400
and escrow documents
Again, I'm sorry

195
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,400
Again, I'm sorry about changing my mind,

196
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,400
but this just isn't really
a good time to sell the house

197
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,400
Zach's going through a lot, and he wants to finish
high school before moving

198
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,100
Ah, forget it
It's part of the business

199
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,500
I expect to get screwed over

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,200
Now,  where is your house key?

201
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,700
Oh, I must have left it at home

202
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,300
I'll bring it by tonight

203
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,500
No one will be here
Zach's away on a school trip,

204
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,700
and I'm going to mount pleasant
on business today

205
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,600
Just drop it by tomorrow

206
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,500
Or I could just keep it

207
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,000
What?

208
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,700
It's a joke, paul
I know your wife's dead and all,

209
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,200
but it's been six months... lighten up

210
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,100
Hello

211
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:01,819
Felicia

212
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,800
Oh, hi, felicia

213
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,300
Edie, I found this
in my sister's things

214
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,100
It has your name on it

215
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,400
Oh... my necklace

216
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,600
Oh, you know
I lent this to martha three months ago,

217
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,400
and she said that
it went down the drain

218
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,600
Oh, I miss how we used to
steal things from one another

219
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,100
So, felicia...

220
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,800
I heard they have a suspect
in your sister's murder

221
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,900
Mike Delfino ?

222
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,200
Oh, he didn't kill her

223
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,200
But they found her jewelry
in his garage

224
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,300
But his fingerprints
weren't on any of it

225
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,100
Well, that just means
he wore gloves

226
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,700
So he's smart enough
to use gloves,

227
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,500
but he leaves her blood-spattered jewelry
lying around for anyone to find?

228
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,400
Please ...
Is that what you'd do if you killed someone?

229
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,100
I don't know what goes through
the mind of a murderer

230
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,572
I'm just saying I wouldn't
trust him if I were you

231
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,700
Edie, that is lovely

232
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Is it an antique?

233
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,400
Yeah, I think so

234
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,700
You know, I know a store you would love
It specializes in antique jewelry

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,500
It's in salt lake city. 
Have you ever been to salt lake city?

236
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,400
No, I try to steer clear of utah

237
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,400
It's a little too
conservative for me

238
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,700
Too bad

239
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,700
Have you ever been, paul?

240
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,700
No

241
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,500
It's lovely

242
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,000
I used to live there
when I was a nurse

243
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,500
You should definitely
go sometime

244
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,800
Bye

245
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,200
With no indoor plumbing,

246
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,100
gabrielle was now forced to improvise 
when it came to her personal hygiene

247
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,300
wherever and whenever

248
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,100
she had the opportunity

249
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,400
Sorry

250
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,700
That's okay. I was just about 
to give a maisy gibbons update

251
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,100
Guys, we should be ashamed of ourselves
 for reveling in that woman's misery

252
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,600
That being said,
Edie, please continue

253
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,200
Well, I hear from a very reliable source

254
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,400
that maisy's going to cut
a deal with the prosecution

255
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,200
Apparently, she has some high-profile johns,
and the DA'S looking for a second term

256
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't get it

257
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,900
I don't get who would
pay maisy for sex

258
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,100
Obviously, someone who's
not getting it at home

259
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,400
So the upshot is maisy is going to turn over her little black book
 with all of her clients' names

260
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,000
- Really ?
- Yep

261
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,300
I mean, can you imagine the fallout 
when this goes public?

262
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,800
blood on the walls

263
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
I'm all in

264
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,800
I'll call

265
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,700
Bree?

266
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,000
Uh, what just happened?

267
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,100
The stakes were raised

268
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yes, yes, they were

269
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,700
I fold

270
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,600
I can't believe
how lucky you were today

271
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,600
Luck had nothing to do with it

272
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,000
I had crappy cards
I was bluffing the entire time

273
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,900
Really?
Wow, you're good

274
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,500
Oh, that's the only nice thing 
I could say about my first husband --

275
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,700
he taught me how to bluff

276
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,800
He played poker?

277
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,900
No, he was lousy in bed

278
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,600
I had to fake
a lot of orgasms

279
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,700
You don't have to respond

280
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,500
Thank you

281
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,300
So, uh... where was susan today?

282
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,900
Uh, I'm not sure

283
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,193
- Wow, tom must be great in bed
- Huh?

284
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,700
Well, obviously, you have
no idea how to bluff

285
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,800
Okay

286
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,500
She's going through something, and I'm sure
she'd prefer it to be private

287
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,600
She's upset with mike,
isn't she?

288
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
Well, come on...
I'm going to find out sooner or later

289
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,700
She's devastated
about the breakup,

290
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,100
and she hasn't
left the house in days

291
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,500
Well, why didn't you
just tell me that?

292
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,700
Because it's personal

293
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,300
It's the kind of thing
she would only want me to tell her friends

294
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,100
I'm susan's friend

295
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,500
Well, I don't hate her

296
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,800
Edie, if you want me to share stuff with you, 
you're going to have to start being more supportive of susan

297
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Okay. How?

298
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,500
What do friends do?
They call, they're sympathetic,

299
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,100
they ask about the pain the other person
is going through,

300
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,700
and  then they listen

301
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,600
What if you want to be supportive,

302
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,000
but you just can't stand
listening to people bitch?

303
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,500
Then it's good
to know how to bluff

304
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,400
God, I have to go to the bathroom again

305
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,600
Go to bree'S

306
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,500
I've been to bree'stwice today

307
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,400
Then go to Susan's

308
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,000
I hate Susan's

309
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,100
She has all these weirdscented candles
Her house reeksof apricot Hose

310
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,700
- How about lynette's?
- No, you don't understand

311
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I don't want to go to anybody's house anymore

312
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,500
I'm tired of knocking on doorsand making up excuses
as to why we haven't fixed our plumbing

313
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,900
Why are you yellingat me?

314
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,900
Because it's your fault ?

315
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,100
My fault?

316
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,300
Yes. If you hadn'tgotten yourself indicted,

317
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,500
we would have pipes right now

318
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,200
I got indicted trying to make enough money 
to keep you happy

319
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,200
In case you hadn't noticed, 
you're a little materialistic

320
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,600
Oh, I'm materialistic?

321
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,900
When the johnsons bought their new 7-series, you were the one 
who went right in and traded in his car for something better

322
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,100
Who ended up driving it?

323
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,900
You know what?
I don't have time to fight right now

324
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,400
I have laundry to do

325
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,200
Nurse abigail?

326
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,600
Mrs Scavo, right?

327
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,400
The twins' mother?

328
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,400
I just wanted to tell you that

329
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,000
the boys are now, ha ha
... lice-free

330
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,100
Good to hear

331
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,600
I just can't figure outhow it happened

332
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,600
They get a bath every night
Trust me,

333
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,100
it's the ugliest 15 minutes of the day

334
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,700
I believe you

335
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,700
I keep thinking that

336
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,400
maybe it was the petting zoo
that I took them to last week

337
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,700
That llama was really iffy

338
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,000
Mrs Scavo, it doesn't work that way

339
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,100
Lice only spreads from human to thuman

340
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,800
Even the cleanest kid in the world can get it
if he gets too close to the wrong kid

341
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,500
Really?

342
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,100
Yes. So don't be so hard on yourself, huh?

343
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,400
I guess
Still, I can't help but feel a little guilty

344
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
After all, my kids started

345
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,200
an entire lice outbreak

346
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,000
Look, your, uh, your kids didn't start it

347
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,600
They didn't?

348
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,000
No. I know for a fact that patient 
zerowas another little boy

349
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,000
This is his fourth time with this particular problem

350
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,400
Oh. That is a load off my mind

351
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,700
Well, thank you

352
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,900
So which kid is it?

353
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,600
I can't tell you

354
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,100
You know we have a no-blame policy

355
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,600
We have to protect the children

356
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,000
You understand?

357
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,100
Of course

358
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
No, I don'T
You're going to have to give me a name

359
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,200
Mrs Scavo --

360
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:15,900
here's the thing

361
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,300
acting like parents won't assign blame is like pretending 
they don't keep score at pee-wee league games

362
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
It's human nature

363
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,900
If you don't give the moms

364
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,800
someone to blame, they'll pick a scapegoat

365
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,700
I can't let my boysbe the scapegoat

366
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,200
Please don't put me in this position

367
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,800
I'm begging you

368
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
They've already been uninvited 
from a birthday party,

369
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,200
a really big birthday party

370
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,600
with a bouncy house
and a hot dog stand and a clown

371
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,600
I wish I could help you, but --

372
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,900
for god's sakes, there's going to be a magician

373
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,200
Tami brennan went all out

374
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Tami brennan?

375
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Topher's mother?

376
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,400
Yes

377
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,600
Well, isn't that interesting?
Have a seat

378
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,673
Meanwhile, at the fairview county prison,

379
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,900
maisy gibbons was delighted to 
find out she had a visitor,

380
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,100
but she was soon reminded

381
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,700
one should always beware of visitors
bearing gift baskets

382
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,100
You've gotto be kidding me

383
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,700
Hello, maisy

384
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,500
Stuff like this is why I love you

385
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,700
So... what brings you here?

386
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
I need a favor

387
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,000
I thought as much

388
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,700
I heard that there's a, um, little black book

389
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,700
with the name of your clients in it

390
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,400
There is

391
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,200
I was wondering if, perhaps,

392
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,400
you could remove rex's name from that little book

393
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,500
Wow, that's a big favor

394
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,000
Those muffins better be really good

395
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,100
I have some money that I've been 
putting aside for emergencies

396
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,600
It can be all yoursif you just

397
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,700
keep my mouth shut?

398
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,900
Continue to be discreet

399
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,100
Gosh... I don't know

400
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,400
I don't think it's asking that much

401
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,700
All you need to do is remove one little name

402
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,500
But if I do it for you,

403
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,900
then I have to do it
for all the other wives

404
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,800
That wouldn't be fair, now, would it?

405
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,400
Maisy, please

406
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
I mean, we used to be good friends

407
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,400
Ah. Where were you when harold lost his job 
a year ago, huh?

408
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,200
Did you stop by to see if there was
anything that you could do?

409
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,800
Did you bringa big basket of baked goods
when you knew we couldn't even pay our bills?

410
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,300
If you did, 

411
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,000
those displays of friendship
seem to have slipped my mind

412
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Maisy, I didn't mention it when you were 
having financial troubles

413
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,900
because I thought it would embarrass you

414
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
Yes, I would have been embarrassed,

415
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,000
but it would have been a whole lot better
than the silence

416
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,800
I have $14,000 in that account

417
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,000
It can all be yours

418
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,400
I'm not interested

419
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,400
But you do get credit for one thing

420
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,600
You came to visit me,

421
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
even if it was for an ulterior motive

422
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,900
None of the other girls
from the club even bothered

423
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,600
I've been abandoned

424
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,400
Guess that's what happens
when you become the town whore

425
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Oh, sweetie

426
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,500
They didn't abandon you
because you're a whore

427
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,100
They abandoned you because you weren't
all that nice to begin with

428
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,500
Who is it?

429
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,700
It's edie!

430
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,700
Oh, edie, not nowI'm kind of busy

431
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,700
Hi

432
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,300
Or just come on in

433
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,800
What are you doing?

434
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,800
I decided that my life
is way too complicated,

435
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,800
and so I'm simplifying

436
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,700
I am getting rid of the clutter

437
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,400
Ooh

438
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,800
I was on vacation. 
Made sense at the time

439
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
Okay, not to be rude,

440
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,100
but is there a reason you're here?

441
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,300
Look... I'm feeling badly about 
what you'regoing through with mike

442
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,100
And don't worry I'm not going to date him

443
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,700
Doesn't matter anymore

444
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,000
Well, don't get me wrong,

445
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,600
I still have every intention of sleeping with him

446
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,800
Some mountains are just meant to be climbed

447
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,700
I got to learn to keep my doors locked

448
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,500
How long have you been sitting here?

449
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,200
I don't know

450
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,700
Five minutes, give or take three hours

451
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,700
That's i. Get up

452
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,000
Get dressed

453
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:50,800
Why?

454
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,200
'Cause you're coming with me

455
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
It's time to get wasted

456
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,000
Happy hour started 45 minutes ago

457
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,800
Why would I go anywhere with you?

458
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,300
Because that's what normal women do
when they get depressed

459
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,400
They put on short skirts,
they go to bars with their girlfriends,

460
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,500
maybe have one too many and then make out
with some strange man in the back of a dark alley

461
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,300
Wow

462
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,500
Oh, come on

463
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,900
It'll be fun, I swear

464
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,700
Come on. Come on

465
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,100
Why do you even care?

466
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,400
I never said I cared

467
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:28,600
It's just... well, I I guess I know what it's like
to have your heart stomped on

468
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,300
Okay. All right. Give me a minute
I'll go change my clothes

469
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,300
And don't forget to do something
with that skanky hair

470
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,600
You're a little scary-looking

471
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,000
Oh, what about him?

472
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Not my type

473
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,000
Oh, look, I know the pickins are slim,
but isn't there someone here that you're attracted to?

474
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
I hate them all

475
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,200
Look at them just leering at us
They're so damn cocky, like they know they have the upper hand

476
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,500
What are you talking about?
We have the upper hand

477
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,500
Without us, they have nothing

478
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,500
Maybe 15 years ago
Not anymore

479
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,900
Now we're just lonely and desperate,
and they know it,

480
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,400
and they just sit there ready to pounce, you know,

481
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,500
waiting for us to take any crumb
they're willing to throw our way

482
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,500
I don't want crumbs

483
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,000
I want mike

484
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,200
Hi, Um.... I'm going to be spending
the whole night with her,

485
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,600
so I'm going to be needing
a lot more of these

486
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
I'm sorry

487
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,600
It's just so hard to find a guy like mike

488
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,800
I know in my heart he didn't kill mrs Huber

489
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,300
Okay, let's say mike's a peach
and he didn't kill martha

490
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,300
Who did?

491
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,100
I don't know

492
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,700
Obviously, a bad guy
Somebody really awful,

493
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,100
somebody like -- somebody 
like Paul Young

494
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,300
Paul? Ha ha

495
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,100
Are you serious?

496
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,400
I'm telling you, he's hiding something

497
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,200
He clams up every time we try 
to ask him about mary alice

498
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,100
And then when we found out about dana

499
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,100
Dana. Who's dana?

500
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,000
Paul and mary alice had a baby that died

501
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,800
You're kidding

502
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,300
Zach killed her

503
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,200
Holy crap. Who told you that?

504
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,900
Paul. He said it was an accident,

505
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,300
but I'm telling you,
I think that's why mary alice was being blackmailed

506
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Mary alice was being blackmailed?

507
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,200
Yeah

508
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,800
The girls and i found a threatening note
in her stuff

509
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,700
What the hell kind of street 
do we live on?

510
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,100
I don't know

511
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,100
Come to think of it, the other day,

512
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,300
paul was talkingto felicia,

513
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,800
and he was working overtime
trying to make mike sound guilty

514
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,757
See? Shifting blame onto someone else --
that's classic criminal behavior

515
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:55,231
Oh, I'm telling you, he's up to no good

516
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,600
Zach and paul are out of town

517
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,100
Maybe we should sneak into their house
and do some snooping


518
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,700
I have a key

519
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,300
Oh, my god, yes
We should do that

520
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Oh, come on. I was just kidding

521
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,400
No, edie, this is our chance
We should just go infor 10 minutes

522
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,900
Susan, that's breaking and entering

523
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,500
Martha huber was your best friend

524
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,400
If we could find out who really killed her,

525
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,000
wouldn't that be worth the risk?

526
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,600
- Have a nice evening
- Thank you

527
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Serena, hi. How are you?

528
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,534
- I talked to Dr Wallace today
- Oh?

529
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,700
He still has no idea why 
the medicationisn't working

530
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,900
He told me he's thinking
of running more tests

531
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,900
I told him I'm thinking about
getting a second opinion

532
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,400
Rex, this might sound silly,

533
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,200
- but are people staring at us?
- Yeah. What's going on?

534
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,100
Well, I could be wrong,

535
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,400
but I suspect that maisy gibbons' client list
has been released

536
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,800
You think they're laughing at us?

537
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,900
No, I think they're laughing at you

538
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,800
I think they feel sorry for me,
which is just as mortifying

539
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,019
- What are we going to do?
- Oh

540
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,600
We're going to act like nothing is happening,

541
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:26,000
and then, when we finish eating,
we're going to walk out of here with all

542
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,200
the dignity that we can muster

543
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,300
Please, let's go now

544
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,400
Oh, no I refuse to give them
this kind of satisfaction

545
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,200
Open your menu

546
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,100
Everybody's staring, bree
It's humiliating

547
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,000
Well, you should have thought of that
before you left a personal check on maisy gibbons' nightstand

548
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,500
All right, you stay here
if you want to I'm leaving

549
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,400
Rex, if you walk out of this restaurant,

550
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,500
I will scream

551
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,500
- Bree¡H
- I will scream

552
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,400
about your cruelty
Then I will scream about your infidelity

553
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,600
And then just to make sure it really hurts,
I will scream about your distasteful sexual habits

554
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,500
You want to know what true humiliation is,
you just take one step

555
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,400
So, what are you having?

556
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,800
The veal looks good

557
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,400
So what are we looking for, exactly?

558
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,900
An embroidered pillow that says
"I killed martha huber"?

559
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,500
I don't know
Just something suspicious

560
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
Mmm, smells expensive

561
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,500
Do you believe in evil, edie?

562
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,200
Of course I believe in evil
I work in real estate

563
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,900
I'm serious

564
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,400
There's something about this house
that's just so cold

565
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,900
and creepy

566
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,500
You couldn't tell when mary alice was alive

567
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,200
She just brought so much warmth and light

568
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,000
Now there's something

569
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,100
I can just taste it
Can't you sense it?

570
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,000
The only thing I can sense
is that you've had too much to drink

571
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,600
Oh, something happened in this house,

572
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,300
something so awful we can't even imagine it

573
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,400
Ow! Son of a bitch

574
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,300
Are you okay?

575
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,000
I just stubbed my toe

576
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,518
- Oh, my god -- angela
- Huh?

577
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,900
Angela -- that's what mary alice 
used to call herself

578
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,100
What are you talking about?

579
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,300
We heard it on this tape

580
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,100
that bree stole from her the rapist's office
It's a long story I'll tell you later

581
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,300
Oh, we got to put this in

582
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,200
What was that?

583
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,700
I think it's paul

584
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,300
You said he was going to be gone

585
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,300
Well, I guess I was wrong

586
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,700
Hurry

587
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
I got to get the tape

588
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,700
Hide!

589
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,600
Paul

590
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,700
Oh! Oh! Oh! Edie
God, you scared me

591
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,800
I'm sorry I see that you, uh,
made it back from mount pleasant

592
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,300
Yes. What -- what are you doing here?

593
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,400
Well, I came by to bring you your key

594
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,000
I was just about to leave you a note

595
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,400
You're returning my key at 11:30 at night

596
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,400
What the hell's going on here?

597
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,500
You're right

598
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,374
- We're too old to be playing games
- What?

599
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,100
My note was goingto tell you that I, uh...

600
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,600
I-I wasn't kidding this afternoon

601
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,600
I really would like
to keep a key to your place --

602
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:18,000
to use if the mood strikes me

603
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,800
Ha ha. You've been drinking

604
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,100
Just enough to get up the courage

605
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,900
to tell you how I feel about you

606
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Okay, well. obviously, you're 
uncomfortable about this,

607
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,400
so I-I'm really sorry if I embarrassed you

608
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,400
Here, here's your key

609
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,200
I'll see you around

610
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,600
Edie, um...
I'm not embarrassedHuh?

611
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,200
If anything, I'm flattered

612
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,800
Susan, Susan, talk to me

613
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
Mike, it's not a good time

614
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,200
I'm a little drunk and a little freaked out

615
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,900
Why haven't you returned
any of my messages?

616
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,700
We're broken up

617
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,200
I thought I made that pretty clear

618
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,800
Oh, come on
Can't we work this out?

619
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,600
You lied to me

620
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,000
When? When did I lie to you?

621
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,400
The police showed me your rap sheet

622
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,800
You killed a man

623
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,100
You can't believe I'm some cold-blooded killer

624
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,500
Well, of course I don't believe that,

625
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,900
but I also didn't believe that karl was going
to cheat on me,

626
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,200
and I didn't believe that mary alice
was going to kill herself

627
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,900
I mean, let's face it, mike --
blind faith is not my friend

628
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,000
I was going to tell you

629
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,900
There just wasn't a right moment

630
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,300
See? Now that's a lie, too,

631
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,400
because there were plenty of right moments

632
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,400
- Susan¡K¡K
- every time we went out for pizza,

633
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,100
you could have said,
"oh, and by the way, I once killed a man"

634
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,900
Or when you said, "hey, let's go jogging,"

635
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,800
you could have said,
"well, by the way, I once killed a man"

636
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,100
Every time we went to the movies

637
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,700
and the hero shot the bad guy,

638
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,800
you could have turned to me and said,

639
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,100
"oh, and by the way,I did that once" You didn't

640
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,300
Do you want to hear what happened or not?

641
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,300
It doesn't matter,

642
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,272
because I will never believe
anything you say ever again

643
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,800
Well, at the very least,
you can believe that

644
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Occupied

645
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,600
Carlos, I have to go

646
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,300
Well, you're going to have to wait

647
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,200
Why should I have to wait?

648
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,300
It's my port-a-potty

649
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,300
What do you mean, it's yours?

650
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,500
I'm the one who stole it

651
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,000
Babe, I'm sorry

652
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,000
You're just going to have to wait

653
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,800
Thank you so much, bree

654
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,500
Seeing your tile has really
helped me make my decision

655
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,300
Next time I remodel, I am using limestone

656
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,700
Gabrielle, is everything okay?

657
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,700
Sure, why?

658
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,200
Well, it's just that you've been acting
kind of odd lately

659
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,600
In what way?

660
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,300
Well, you keep coming up with excuses
to use everyone's bathroom,

661
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:50,300
and then two days ago, mr Cowley looked into your back yard 
and saw you and carlosdoing your laundry in the jacuzzi

662
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,400
Well, uh, there's a simple explanation for that

663
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,000
I, um¡K¡K

664
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,400
are you and carlos having
some sort of money trouble?

665
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,100
Gabby, it's okay if you are

666
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,100
- Is that so?
- Yes, and....

667
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,700
and to tell you the truth,
I'm a little insulted I am a good friend

668
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,600
Why would you feel like you 
have to hide that from me?

669
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,600
I don't know

670
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,900
Probably for the same reason
you didn't tell me rex was one of maisy's clients

671
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,500
That is obviously different

672
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,500
Why?

673
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,400
Because it happened to you?

674
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,100
Bree, this is how I see it --

675
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,400
good friends support each other
after they've been humiliated

676
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,800
Great friends pretend nothing happened
in the first place

677
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,300
Well, then, good luck on your remodel

678
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,400
And please tell rex I said hello

679
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,100
Hey, tami

680
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,900
Lynette

681
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,900
I see topher's made a speedy recovery

682
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,500
Can we go play?

683
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,300
Yeah, sure, boys
Have fun

684
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,300
Whoo! Let's go play in the bounce house!
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

685
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,260
All right, you caught me I lied

686
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,600
But, uh, you sure have some nerve,
crashing a 6-year-old's birthday party

687
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,900
Just so you know,
I got topher a set of bongo drums

688
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,000
I know you'll love them as much as he will

689
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,800
Charlie, come on out of there!

690
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,300
I don't want you playing
with those scavo boys!

691
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,000
Uh, mona, please I'm sure they're clean

692
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,600
You are not ruining my party

693
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:02,015
All right, porter, preston, okay, out, out, out
Come on. Porter, preston, let's go

694
00:39:02,022 --> 00:39:03,121
No, not -- not --not quite yet

695
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,400
Boys, keep bouncing.
That's right. Keep bouncing

696
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,700
Oh, by the way,
I spoke to nurse abigail

697
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
I know who patient zero is

698
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,500
All right, that's it, kids get out

699
00:39:16,573 --> 00:39:17,741
Out, out, out
Go, go

700
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
How could you do that?

701
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,900
Look, this party meant everything to topher

702
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,400
I couldn't risk people not showing up

703
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,000
He would be devastated
I had to do something

704
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,200
And the best you could come up with
was letting my kids take the fall?

705
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,000
Hey, I hardly had to say anything

706
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,700
People were already suspicious

707
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,300
- Oh, please
- Yeah, it's true. Let's face it --

708
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,900
your boys aren't the cleanes
tkids on the planet

709
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,000
That was not a smart thing to say

710
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,400
Where are you going?

711
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,400
I'm going to tell the truth
to every mother out there,

712
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,200
and then I'm going to take back the bongos

713
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,600
No, wait, okay, all right
Look, I wa--I was wrong

714
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,200
I admit it.
I am really, really, really sorry

715
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,500
Too little, too late

716
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,200
Okay, okay

717
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,900
No, I'll -- I'll tell everyone that I was wrong,

718
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,400
that your kids aren't the ones

719
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,300
Please, I'm begging you

720
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,000
Well, why are you standing there?

721
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,100
Get to it

722
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,500
- Bree, hi
- Hi

723
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,400
What's up?

724
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,600
Well, um, I've been doing some thinking

725
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Rex and I have been members of the 
fairview country club for years, and

726
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,900
well, lately, it seems to have 
lost some of its exclusivity,

727
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,100
and so I've decided not to renew our membership

728
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,400
I'd rather see the money
go to someone I care about

729
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,200
Oh, bree, I-I can't take that

730
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:08,500
Gabby, this is the way I see it --
good friends offer to help in a crisis

731
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,900
Great friends, don't take no for an answer

732
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,300
We're going to pay you back
every cent

733
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,500
I promise

734
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,100
Take your time

735
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,600
Yes, everyone loves a scandal

736
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,100
no matter how big or small

737
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:53,700
After all what could bemore entertaining
than watching the downfall of the high and mighty?

738
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:03,900
What could be more amusing than the 
public exposure of hypocritical sinners?

739
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,700
Yes, everyone loves a scandal

740
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,600
And if for some reason,
you're not enjoying the latest one

741
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:23,909
well the next one...
is always around the corner
