1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,320
previously on...

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,370
you put my kids in danger,and then you lied about it.

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,350
Do you have some kindof problem with alcohol?

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,030
Lynette asked a loaded question.

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,620
I'm the one who wassleeping with your son,

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,720
but it's over now.

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,210
No,you're wrong. It's noteven close to being over.

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,710
Gabrielle confessed...

9
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,860
here's your mail.

10
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,920
While noah's search for zach...

11
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,400
I worry for that boy.

12
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,940
What kind of people wouldbuy a baby from a junkie?

13
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,280
Played perfectly into felicia's plot...

14
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,410
see that paul young hasa toy chest of his very own.

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,160
For revenge.

16
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,400
What made my husband paul young such a good investor

17
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,080
was his uncanny ability to anticipate the future...

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,930
zach,how did youdo this?

19
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,010
He foresaw the necessity of the velcro shoe.

20
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,320
He predicted the advent of the $3 cup of coffee.

21
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,130
He even anticipated the surprising boom in bottled water.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,560
Yeah,it's paul young.

23
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,640
I've been reading aboutthe election results in brazil.

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,140
It's time to buy sugar.

25
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,460
but the crystal ball that served paul so well in the stock market

26
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,180
sometimes failed him closer to home.

27
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,080
- Paul young?
- Yeah.

28
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,330
Detective sullivan.

29
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,110
You need to come downtownfor questioning.

30
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,120
About what?

31
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,810
We're investigating reportsof credit card fraud,

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,550
and your name has been linkedwith several of the victims.

33
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,780
Well,it must be some mistake.

34
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:30,800
Could be.

35
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,300
But we still need to go downtownand straighten it out.

36
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,930
All right.

37
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,720
Well...

38
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,120
how longis this gonna take?

39
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,330
Don't worry about it.It's just a mix-up.

40
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,210
Let's go.

41
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,870
What's going on?I thought you just wanted to ask me some questions.

42
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,840
- That's after you're booked.Booked? 
- Booked for what?

43
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,610
You can't book himhere anyhow,detective.

44
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,400
Computers are down.

45
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,260
We're all full up.

46
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,630
You gottatake him down to county.

47
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,440
What is going on?This is crazy.

48
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,040
I wanna call my lawyer.

49
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,130
What the hell do you guysthink you're doing anyway? Huh?

50
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,460
This is ridiculous.

51
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,690
I get a phone call!

52
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,870
Yes,in the world of investments,

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,060
my husband had a remarkable ability to see the future.

54
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,110
Got a message for you,paul young.

55
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,550
Dierdre's fathersaid to give you his regards.

56
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,190
Aah!

57
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,330
But sadly,paul didn't see this one coming at all.

Desperate housewives
Season 2 Episode 16

61
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,950
Bree van de kamp

62
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,500
had a weekly routine she'd been following for years.

63
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,880
She cleaned on tuesdays.

64
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,710
She paid her bills on wednesdays.

65
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,830
She did her laundry on thursdays.

66
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,860
And after these daily chores were completed,

67
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,630
she would reward herself with a little drink.

68
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,870
What bree didn't know  was this latest addition to her routine 

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,040
had been noticed by her friends.

70
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,960
And it had now become part of their routine to discuss it.

71
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,070
So apparently bree hada few too many and passed out.

72
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,910
Next thing I know, I get a call at work--

73
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,850
someone found my kids wandering the street.

74
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,200
Oh,my god!

75
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,810
Have you seen bree since?

76
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,740
No. I'm worried about her,

77
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,430
but I don't know how I'm gonna get over what she did.

78
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,740
hey,bree.

79
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,600
How you doing today?

80
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,780
I'm really well.

81
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,750
Um,I just saw you all talking before lynette went off to work.

82
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,400
What were you all talking about?

83
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,060
Oh,nothing,really.

84
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,850
Carlos and I are gonna go see the adoption counselor today.

85
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,100
I'm checking myself into the hospital.

86
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,640
I'm finally gonna get that surgery.

87
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,200
Oh. Good for you.

88
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,650
Did lynette mention the little tiff we had?

89
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,710
Just in passing.

90
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,440
She barely mentioned it.

91
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,720
Because what happened was,

92
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,460
I accidentally mixed my antihistamine medication with,

93
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,750
you know, a little glass of wine I was having, and I-

94
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,210
I fell asleep, you know,while I was...

95
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,050
watching her kids.

96
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,000
I mean,I like a little wine with dinner,

97
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,470
I mean,now and then. You know,who doesn't?

98
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,270
But,uh,I mean,

99
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,560
you know, to trash my entire reputation--

100
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,450
oh,bree, she didn't trash you. Honest.

101
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,130
Well,good. I mean,I just--

102
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,860
I really wouldn't want you to get the wrong impression.

103
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,610
Well,I'm--I'm going to the mall.

104
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,770
They're having a white sale today.

105
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,800
I think I'm gonna get a new bath mat.

106
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,780
Oh,does anyone need one?

107
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,390
- No,I'm good. 
- Okay,take care.

108
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,960
Wow,did you smell the alcohol on her breath?

109
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,090
I sure did.

110
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,240
Oh.

111
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,520
Then our eskimo turns in the camera and says,

112
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,090
"polar fresh mints will give your breath 

113
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,690
an 'a'-plus,too."

114
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,170
So what do you think?

115
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,630
It feels a little familiar.

116
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,140
Really? I don't think so.

117
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,200
No,I'm pretty sure the lowell group used eskimos

118
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,330
in a deodorant commercial they had last month. Remember?

119
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,370
Oh,this is completely different.

120
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,010
Those were jock eskimos competing in the iditarod.

121
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,440
Our eskimo's trying to,you know,

122
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,450
patch things up with his wife.

123
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,130
Yeah. No,I get the subtle distinction.

124
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,550
I think we can do better.

125
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,920
Okay? So,sally,you're up.

126
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,460
What do you got for me?

127
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,310
Hey.

128
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,250
Hey.

129
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,440
"I got the subtle distinction"?

130
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,610
What was that about?

131
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,980
If you really wanna do this now, shut the door.

132
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,190
Okay,sure, I was a little bitchy.

133
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,330
But you know why? You did a half-ass job in there.

134
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,750
Hey,you may not like my idea,

135
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,620
but you can't say I didn't work hard.

136
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,480
Oh,please.

137
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,860
I live with you.

138
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,400
Last night, when you should've been trying to make that pitch work,

139
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,420
you were watching the game.

140
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,810
I wasn't watching the game.

141
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,060
I saw you!

142
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,200
What,okay,now I can't check the score?

143
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,090
Are you saying you gave your heart and soul to that eskimo pitch?

144
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,810
I worked really hard on that pitch.

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,350
Did you give it 100%?

146
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,570
Well,exactly. So? Big deal.

147
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,000
Go work up some new ideas,

148
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,650
and then we'll go over it during lunch.

149
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,220
Okay?

150
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,430
You're the boss.

151
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,240
Yes,i am.

152
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,590
Hey.

153
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,010
Susan.

154
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,290
Good to see you again.

155
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,690
I'm really looking forward to your surgery.

156
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,460
And I'm really hoping you're a lefty.

157
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,260
Nope. I can't even write my name.

158
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,190
But that's what I get for throwing my kid a roller-skating party.

159
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,710
Funny. So what about my surgery?

160
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,740
Oh,I'll still do it.

161
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,890
With dr. Ron's help,of course.

162
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,820
Dr. Cunningham will be standing right beside me.

163
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,090
With my hands and his brain,

164
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,790
you got the best parts of both of us.

165
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,540
Then I'm on board.

166
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,210
We're keeping you under observation, so,

167
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,620
hopefully, we'll operate tomorrow.

168
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,200
Uh,if you don't mind,

169
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,140
I'd like a minute to consult with my patient.

170
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,610
Oh! Right, your,um,little thing.

171
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,620
What "little thing"?

172
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,500
Um,well,it was--it was gonna be a surprise,but...

173
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
Oh,my god,

174
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,010
they're beautiful.

175
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,490
Um,look,I've been thinking about us 

176
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,060
a lot lately--

177
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,050
about putting this operation behind us and where we'll go from there.

178
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,800
Our future...

179
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,090
together.

180
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,300
And I really suck at putting my emotions into words, which is,um,

181
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,700
it's why I wrote it all down.

182
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,190
There's a card.

183
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,270
Oh.

184
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,240
Uh,but you can't read it.

185
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,330
Not--not while I'm here anyway.

186
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,350
It's way,way too stressful.

187
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,780
Um,I am going to go now.

188
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,790
Wow.

189
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,440
Wow.

190
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,220
Oh,he's so romantic.

191
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,400
May I?

192
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,840
Oh,it's sort of private.

193
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,050
Well,I did help him pick out the flowers.

194
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,010
Oh. Um...

195
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,630
okay.

196
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,520
There's more on the back.

197
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,580
so how does this work?

198
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,530
Do we flip through a catalog or something?

199
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,280
I wish it was that easy.

200
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,330
You have to understand,for every baby,

201
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,110
there are ten coupleswho want it.

202
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,670
You don't choose your child.The birth mother chooses you.

203
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,110
Really?

204
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,090
So what do you thinkour chances are?

205
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,370
We will do anythingthat we need to do.

206
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,390
Well,your typical birth motheris usually a young girl,

207
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,650
and she'll just wanna make sureyou're quality people.

208
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,660
Now to show her that,

209
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,250
you'll be putting togethera parent portfolio.

210
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,970
What's that?

211
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,410
Family pictures,character references,

212
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,860
that kind of stuff.

213
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,860
So,um,we're auditioningto be parents?

214
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,420
I guessyou could say that.

215
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,640
So just to be clear,

216
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,020
some slutty cheerleader getsknocked up by the soccer coach

217
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:50,060
behind the localgas 'n gulp,and she is going to make sure we're quality people?

218
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,340
you don't needto answer that.

219
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,610
You know,you don'thave to hide it from me.

220
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,640
Hmm?

221
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,130
Drinking.It doesn't bother me.

222
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,210
Oh,I wasn'thiding anything.

223
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,110
I was simply... 

224
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,200
enjoying the day.

225
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:13,890
What you want?

226
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,070
Well,um,masonwas my ride to school.

227
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,490
And his dad'smoving them to tucson so...

228
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,790
oh,well,if you needa ride to school, I'm happy to drive you.

229
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,760
No,that's not what I want.I want a car.

230
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,850
Well,then I suggestyou get a job.

231
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,610
Why should I go work my ass offat some fast food place

232
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,490
when I can already affordwhat I want?

233
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,390
Andrew,we're not touchingyour trust fund.

234
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,520
- It's my money.- Not until you're 21.

235
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,550
And if I had my way, you wouldn't get your handson it until you're 50.

236
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,270
I mean,we both know you'regonna waste every penny of it.

237
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,620
Why are youbeing like this?

238
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,120
Because,sweetheart,

239
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,460
it is my job to teach youabout responsibility,

240
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,250
setting goals,delayed gratification.

241
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,840
What do you knowabout delayed gratification?

242
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,290
It's not even noon, yet you're already onyour third glass of wine.

243
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,950
You know,on second thought, I won't be driving youto school.

244
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,720
The walk will do you good.

245
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,320
Mom,I'm not kidding around.

246
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,280
I want my money.

247
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,890
The answer is no.

248
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,380
Well,aren't we a mean old drunk?

249
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,710
Whatever that wassupposed to teach me,

250
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,680
considerthe lesson learned.

251
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,690
oh. Whoo.

252
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,870
What are you doing here?

253
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,620
I'm just enjoying the silkysmooth moves of dr. Ron.

254
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,820
Or should I say,"dr. Love"?

255
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,250
- Give me that. Aah!- This is my favorite--

256
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,300
"I can't wait to bein the operating room with you

257
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,470
"so I cantouch your heart,

258
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,260
"because you've alreadytouched mine so deeply."

259
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,610
Okay,that part sounds betterwhen you don't read it out loud.

260
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,080
And what are you doingreading it anyway?

261
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,150
Those are dr. Ron's private thoughts.

262
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,280
Yeah,I got that.

263
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,080
You know,I sense that he really likes you,susie.

264
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,790
So?

265
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,740
So do you really like him?

266
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,820
Of course I do.

267
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,370
He's smart and funny and kind.

268
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,800
Smart,funny,kind.

269
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,480
I don't hear the word"love" in there.

270
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,790
Well,that's a big word.

271
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,210
We just started dating,and we have a connection,

272
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,820
and I'm gonna follow it throughand see where it goes.

273
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,700
Oh,I get it.You're gonna string him along till you feelsomething you don't

274
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,200
and waste the next five yearsof your life.

275
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,860
As opposed to the 12I wasted on you?

276
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,350
Why are we talkingabout this?

277
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,910
I don't recallasking you your opinion.

278
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,630
Because we're marriedand I have certain rights,

279
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,580
and one of themis the right to badger you.

280
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,480
Okay,you know,you can leave now.

281
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,660
I wish I could M.R.I. Your soul--

282
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,570
out!

283
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,420
it's not funny.

284
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,790
hey,watch out for my wife.She's on a tear.

285
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,160
Oh,here's one we tookon vacation.

286
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,190
Hmm. Gaby,these pictureshave to be wholesome.

287
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,950
They gotta say...

288
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,360
"these people will doa great job raising a child."

289
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,620
So?

290
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,300
So you're topless.

291
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,130
Yeah,but it's st. Barts,

292
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,180
and your hands are coveringmy naughty parts.

293
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,440
Do you mean the handthat's holding the tequila shot,

294
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,030
or the one that's holdingthe cuban cigar?

295
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,210
Yeah,that was a good trip.

296
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,710
Gaby!

297
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,830
- Fine. We won't use it.
- We can't use any of 'em.

298
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,120
Every single pictureof the two of us,

299
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,700
we're either drinkingor smoking or naked.

300
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,040
So we like to have fun. I mean,who doesn't understand that

301
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,520
better than an unwed,knocked-up teenager?

302
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,620
This is serious.

303
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,400
If we can't sell ourselvesas good people...

304
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,820
well,then we'll justhave to find someone who can do it for us.

305
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,300
So you want me to,uh...

306
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,940
pitch you as parents?

307
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,970
You're in advertising.You can do it.

308
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,940
Just write usa character reference saying we're greatwith kids.

309
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,180
Oh,this is for you.

310
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,900
Oh. Well,you don'thave to bribe me.

311
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,050
We're all friends here.(Chuckles)

312
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,560
keeping that in mind,would it also be okay if we wereyour kids' godparents?

313
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,000
Oh! Uh... I guess.

314
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,660
Great,and can we take somefake pictures to document it?

315
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,730
I don't supposeyou brought a corkscrew?

316
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,600
You didn't have a warrant,and if you don't arrest him,

317
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,320
then you gotta tell mewhat he wants.

318
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,950
Hello,mike.

319
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,430
Felicia,what are you doing here?

320
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,230
Oh,I left in such a rush.

321
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,180
There was a lot of old businessI forgot to wrap up.

322
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,310
Well,it must bepretty important business,

323
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,260
gets you to moveback in next door to the man you think murdered your sister.

324
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,340
It's funnyyou should mention paul.

325
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,500
You know,the police cameand took him away last night.

326
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,380
The police?

327
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,750
And from the waythey were manhandling him,

328
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,280
ooh,I don't thinkhe'll be back anytime soon.

329
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,290
(Zach) no,I just wannatalk to him,that's all...

330
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,870
what the hell'sgoing on?

331
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,800
It's noneof your concern,mike.

332
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,170
You listen to me,if anythinghappens to paul young--

333
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,710
it already happened.

334
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,440
Hours ago.

335
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,710
He's dead?

336
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,040
Like I said,

337
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,980
it's none of your concern.

338
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,870
Maybe you don't get it,noah.You screwed up.

339
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,970
You just killedthe most important person in your grandson's life.

340
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,940
Do you think he's gonna haveanything to do with you once he finds out?

341
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,540
And believe me,

342
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,880
I'll make sure he finds out.

343
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,540
So,honey,the meat loaf--it's,um,it's a little burnt.

344
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,430
Oh,right,I was talkingto susan on the phone,

345
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,760
and I left it in a little longerthan I should've. Sorry.

346
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,350
It's okay. (Sighs)

347
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,180
is it that bad?

348
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,630
No. No,not bad at all.

349
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,650
Oh,good.

350
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,850
Parker,don't put your elbowson the table. Come on.

351
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,220
But you'd agreeit wasn't your best effort.

352
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,450
Huh?

353
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,020
The meal,the taskyou agreed to take on.

354
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,440
You'd agree thatyou didn't give it 100%,right?

355
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,130
Tom,if you're gonnamake a point,

356
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,950
why don't you do it nowbefore I hurl the plate at you?

357
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,210
Nobody gives 100% of his effortall the time because they can'T.

358
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,460
It is impossible.

359
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,380
You do the best you can withthe time and energy you have.

360
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,010
Stop right there.This is meat loaf. (Chuckles)

361
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,670
your presentationwas business.

362
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,030
You're saying the clientdeserves more effort than your own family?

363
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,860
Okay.

364
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,630
So if I apologizefor upsetting you at work,

365
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,180
can we get past itand enjoy our meal?

366
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,430
Absolutely.

367
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,830
I'm sorry.I'm sorry. I am sorry.

368
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,350
Thanks.

369
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,260
So,boys,how do you enjoy the meat loaf?

370
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,730
It's a little salty.

371
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:52,940
(Preston) yeah.

372
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,810
Just eat it.

373
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,080
there. 

374
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,520
Perfect.

375
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,030
All right.

376
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,200
all right,one more time.

377
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,120
What?

378
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,970
Yeah.

379
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,070
Dude,I don't wannamess up your face.

380
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,070
Do you love me?

381
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Then do what I tell you.

382
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,030
Rough day.

383
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,560
Yeah.

384
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:49,720
I wonder if there's any way thatwe can turn it around still.

385
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,670
Good question.

386
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,590
But what to do?What to do?

387
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,670
Yeah.

388
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,760
Hi! What's up?

389
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,270
Why do you keep trying to do that?

390
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,890
- What? 
- Trying to get on top.

391
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,210
Of you? No,I'm not.

392
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,390
You were pushing on me likeyou were trying to sack me.

393
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,400
I felt it.

394
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,930
Are you serious?

395
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,350
Tom,I wasn't doing anything.I was just going for it.

396
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,920
I was just lost in the moment.Oh,come on!

397
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,500
Come on,this is silly.I don't wanna argue.

398
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,450
I mean,unless it turns you on.

399
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,020
Does it? 'Cause thenI'm all about it,baby.

400
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,360
What--what was that?

401
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,850
What--what was what?

402
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,050
You were bracing.

403
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,440
You were bracing with your leg.

404
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,730
I was tryingto lie on top of you,

405
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,800
and you were bracing yourselfagainst the mattress

406
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,570
so you didn'thave to get on your back.

407
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,680
Try and deny it.Try and deny it. You can'T.

408
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,960
Okay,okay,can I just mention you're talking like a crazy person?

409
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,950
You can't give it upfor a second,can you?

410
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,240
You always haveto call the shots. Always.

411
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,430
Is this aboutme being boss again?

412
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,910
You gotta get over it.

413
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,290
That's exactly my point.

414
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,660
Exactly.

415
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,050
You are notjust my boss at the office.

416
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,320
You're my boss everywhere.

417
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,230
Oh,that's ridiculous.

418
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,090
You run the show.

419
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,690
You run the show,and I'm along for the ride.

420
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,520
I just pushthe little shopping cart,

421
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,360
let the woman do all the driving.

422
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,390
- Tom... 
- I'm the caddy husband.

423
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,030
I carry your clubs.

424
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,060
I am so sorry you feel that way,

425
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,170
but you cannotput that on me.

426
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,090
This is your life.

427
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,360
You wanna run it?

428
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,420
Then step on up.

429
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,150
You wanna drive?

430
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,840
Grab the steering wheel.

431
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,070
I mean-- what elseam I supposed to say?

432
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,550
I'm gonnacheck on the kids.

433
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,940
Time to checkyour blood pressure.

434
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,190
Oh,sure.

435
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,450
Oh,that's a little tight.Does it have to be that tight?

436
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,710
- Yes.
- Oh.

437
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,420
okay. Ow,ow. That's actuallystarting to be painful.

438
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,680
Really?That surprises me.

439
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,600
I just assumedyou were dead inside.

440
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,200
Ow! Ow! What the hellare you doing?

441
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,740
I told myself to stayout of this,but I can'T.

442
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,190
I know that you're married.

443
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,400
I am not!

444
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:48,500
Really? Hmm,'cause that manthat came to see you yesterday,he saidyou're his wife.

445
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,050
Oh! Yeah,oh...

446
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,420
no,no,he just said that'cause we used to be married.

447
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,510
It's just a force of habit.

448
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,130
Oh,that explainseverything.

449
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,680
Except that I checkedyour insurance forms,and you're still married.

450
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:00,770
So that makes youa lying,adulterous skank.

451
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,710
Oh,no. No,no.No,no,nurse hisel.

452
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:07,130
Ow,ow,ow,ow!Ow,nurse hisel!

453
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,340
Ugh! Nurse--oh!

454
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,180
Nurse hisel,I can explain.

455
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,450
Can you,skank?

456
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,750
Yes. Okay.

457
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,140
I am married,but it's only because my insurance ran out.

458
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,320
My ex-husband hasa really good coverage plan,

459
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,370
so he said thathe would remarry me 

460
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,080
so I couldget my operation.

461
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,340
Only I didn'twanna tell dr. Ron

462
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,410
'cause I didn't want himto be an accomplice to fraud.

463
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,540
So you're what...

464
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,130
protecting him?

465
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,120
Yeah. It--yes,I am.

466
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,570
Okay.

467
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,070
As long as you're nottwo-timing him.

468
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,820
He feelsso strongly about you.

469
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,170
I know. I read the card.

470
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,430
But did you readbetween the lines?

471
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,640
What do you mean?

472
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,930
Okay,I shouldn't betelling you this,

473
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,170
but when we were picking outthe flowers for you,

474
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:05,190
he said that he was working upthe courage to say he loves you.

475
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,050
Really?

476
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,760
Yes!

477
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,620
But you haveto act surprised,okay?

478
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,400
Oh,yeah,I'll be surprised.

479
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,800
So I guess we have the wholeinsurance thing worked out.

480
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,160
Oh! Pfft. Don't worryabout that. Please.

481
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,130
Who am I to cast stones?

482
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,560
I mean,heck...

483
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,250
I didn't passmy nurse's exam.

484
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,060
They didn't even ask me!

485
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,630
Andrew,did I hear the bell?

486
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,700
Oh,hello.

487
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,040
I'm samuel bormanis.I'm here to see andrew.

488
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,530
Oh,okay.Are you a friend of andrew's?

489
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,690
I'm his lawyer.

490
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,970
His lawyer? Well,why on earthwould andrew need a lawyer?

491
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,750
Here you go,sam.

492
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,210
honey,what happened to-- to your face?

493
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,640
I...

494
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,250
you hit me.

495
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,500
Don't you remember?

496
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,020
For the record,I did not punch my son.

497
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,590
I slapped himwith an open palm.

498
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,400
Yeah,but,mom,the thing is,

499
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,370
when you drink,you don't knowyour own strength.

500
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,820
This is ridiculous.

501
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,520
Can't you seethis is a performance?

502
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,510
Mrs. Van de kamp,I've heard enough.

503
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,410
Clearly,this environment isa highly dysfunctional one.

504
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:29,500
Andrew has retained my services in order to pursuea healthier living situation.

505
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,840
And what might that be?

506
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,570
I,um,I wanna be emancipated.

507
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,210
Emancipated?

508
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,560
As an emancipated minor,andrew would be able to live on his own.

509
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,930
He'd still go to school,of course,

510
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,760
but he'd be releasedfrom all adult supervision.

511
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,930
Well,that's the silliest thingI've ever heard of.

512
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,810
How wouldhe support himself?

513
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:54,150
Well,he'd be in completecontrol of his own finances.

514
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,780
So that's what this is about--your trust fund?

515
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,190
Obviously,we'd all prefer not to go to family court,

516
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:07,040
but with the violenceand your D.U.I. Charge,

517
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,760
it could get ugly.

518
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,260
Uh,mr. Bormanis,

519
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,980
I'll need a little timeto think about this.

520
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,060
You have 24 hours.

521
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,790
boy,it really lookslike we're having a good time.

522
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,810
I sure hope this works.

523
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,570
Well,as long as they don'tmake me play guitar,

524
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,450
I thinkwe're home free.

525
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,760
Mr. And mrs. Solis,rhoda can see you now.

526
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,790
Wow!

527
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,660
 It looks like you spendlots of time with these kids.

528
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,010
Oh,we take our rolesas godparents very seriously.

529
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,340
- Don't we,honey?
- Mm-hmm. Yes.

530
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:03,390
Oh,they're precious.What are their names?

531
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,440
Parker and,uh...

532
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,050
porter,uh...

533
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,180
and,uh...

534
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,470
well,they're all p'S.It is super cute.

535
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,230
One sec.Do you need me,helen?

536
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,480
Hello,gabrielle.

537
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,680
Carlos.

538
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,230
I didn't knowyou were adopting.

539
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,100
Preston!

540
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,370
The other one's nameis preston. 

541
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,650
helen,you work here?

542
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,220
You all know each other?

543
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,830
What a small world. It sure is.

544
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,160
Mrs. Solis hired my sonto do her yard work.

545
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,820
And also,she would rape him.

546
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,720
Okay,first of all,it was statutory,

547
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,910
and it happenedso long ago.

548
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,530
Was it? I thinkit was only about a year ago.

549
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,240
No,it was a year,

550
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:02,890
because it was right beforeyour husband went to prison on slave labor charges.

551
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,580
Rhoda,if you don't mind,

552
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,990
I think I'll handlethe solis case myself.

553
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,620
I'd like to make it my top priority.Okay.

554
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:13,110
Oh,and,um,gabrielle,don't bother trying to contact

555
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,540
any other adoption agenciesin the area.

556
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,410
I'll make surethey know all about you.

557
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,100
I think I haveto break up with dr. Ron.

558
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,890
What? Why?

559
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,920
Because he's a gem.

560
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,250
And apparentlyhe loves me.

561
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,240
I'm sorry.I'm not following.

562
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,940
Lynette,he is everything

563
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,700
I could possibly wantin a boyfriend,

564
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,230
and I just don't knowif I feel that...

565
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,070
spark.

566
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,660
You know,and I really want to.

567
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,680
Aw,sweetie.

568
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,300
And he keeps telling mehow special I am

569
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,910
and how muchI mean to him...

570
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,650
how he wants to holdmy beating heart in his hand.

571
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,920
Maybe it's because I just haven'tfelt that thunderbolt yet.

572
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,750
You know,with mike,it hit me.With karl,it his me.

573
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,000
I didn't have to worryabout how I felt

574
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,780
becausethe thunderbolt told me.

575
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,000
Yeah,yeah.Gotta love the thunderbolt.

576
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,220
Do I,though? I mean,I do

577
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,970
But I don'ttrust it anymore.

578
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,150
You know,those relationshipsturned out to be disasters.

579
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,530
Maybe I shouldstick it out with dr. Ron,

580
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:24,230
and I should try heading downa road that's growing and slower

581
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,640
intoa sort of kind of love that would sustain itselffor 50 years. Right?

582
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:31,920
Stability,comfort,endurance--I deserve that.

583
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:36,770
Oh,yes!Of course you do.

584
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,960
Still,you gotta lovethe thunderbolt.

585
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,360
That's not helpful.

586
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,160
Sorry.

587
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,440
Ah,this is a sign.

588
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,570
Will you shut up?

589
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,090
We lost a baby,found outwe can't conceive another one,

590
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,660
and ran into helen rowlandat an adoption agency.

591
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,960
God is obviouslytrying to tell us something.

592
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,430
Carlos,we're catholics,okay?

593
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,540
God is pretty johnny one note on the whole subjectof procreation.

594
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:02,230
Hey,and will you stopwith this defeatist attitude?

595
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,840
Okay,do you wanta baby or not?

596
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,420
I think it's time that we facedreality--

597
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,780
we're bad people,and we probably don'teven deserve to be parents.

598
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,990
Well,then who the hell does?

599
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,580
I mean,look at all the idiotspopping kids.

600
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,870
Okay,they're not any morequalified than we are.

601
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,070
I don't know.

602
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,300
Look,carlos...

603
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,900
it doesn't matterwhat we've done in our past.

604
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,780
Being a parentmeans rising to the occasion,

605
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:29,660
and that's exactlywhat we're gonna do when we bring our baby home.

606
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:35,160
This is the first time I really felt likeyou wanted to have a baby.

607
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,930
(Sighs)well,this is the first time someone told meI couldn't have one.

608
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,800
Okay,so whatare we gonna do?

609
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,450
I mean,no adoption agencyis gonna touch us now.

610
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,140
There are waysto get babies,carlos.

611
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,980
It just might cost us.

612
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,600
I have some contactsin the police department.

613
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,710
I've been making calls,but I can't seem to get a straight answerabout your dad.

614
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,850
I don't understand.How do they just lose somebody?

615
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,530
They don't,not by accident.

616
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,550
But I don't think what happenedto your dad was an accident.

617
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,310
What's thatsupposed to mean?

618
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,940
zach!

619
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,810
Mrs. Tillman.

620
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,630
Hello,zachary.You look terrible.

621
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,660
Oh,mr. Delfino.

622
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,840
Isn't thisjust a picture?

623
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,510
Felicia,why are you here?

624
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:35,240
Young zacharyand I didn't exactly part on the best of terms.

625
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,080
In fact,when the weather's damp,

626
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:41,030
I'm still remindedof our last good-bye.

627
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,500
But forgive and forget.That's my motto.

628
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,590
Macaroon?

629
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,530
dad!

630
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,710
You all right?

631
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:43,350
now how did you knowI love macaroons?

632
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,510
it won't end here,you know.Noah taylor doesn't give up.

633
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,790
Look,don't worry about us.We'll be gone by morning.

634
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,300
No,it's too latefor that now.

635
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,340
I guarantee he's got people watching you.

636
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,990
What is it withyou anyway?

637
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,880
First,you want me to run.

638
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,460
Now you want us to stick around likesitting ducks for this maniac.

639
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:08,290
Go ahead,run. Noah's gotthe cops in his pocket.

640
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,050
What do you think's gonna happenthe first time you try to buy gas 

641
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,120
with a credit card oropen a new bank account?

642
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,360
So I'm a dead man.

643
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,910
Maybe not.

644
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,840
Not if we usewhat leverage we have.

645
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,060
No way.

646
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,810
The old man's gonna be dead in a couple of months,maybe less.

647
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,180
Let him meet zach,

648
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,940
- play the doting grandfather--  
- I said forget it.

649
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,850
I'll do it.

650
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,060
If it meanshe'll leave us alone,

651
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,860
I'm readyto be leveraged.

652
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,030
Nicholsonwill be coming in in about 15 minuteswith a pitch,

653
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:54,710
so let's grab everybody and make surewe're all on the same page.

654
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,600
Hang on a second.

655
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,190
What's going on?

656
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,130
I need to say this.

657
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,820
Ah,yeah...

658
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,040
I have been giving youa lot of grief lately about being the boss.

659
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,480
But it's justhard for a guy to feel like

660
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,650
he's not in chargeof any part of his life.

661
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,650
But,honey, it goes back and forth.

662
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,900
I know. But it just feelsa little one-sided lately,

663
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,470
and sometimesI need to drive the train.

664
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,120
But,look,I know it is my issue.

665
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,420
It's my issue,

666
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,010
and I will step upand deal with it.

667
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,920
Mmm.

668
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,460
Whoa. Hello.

669
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,340
What's going on,huh?

670
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,630
I'm picking up where we left off.

671
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,710
Last night.

672
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,030
Oh,I get it. I get it.

673
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,870
Ooh! This is your ideaof driving the train.

674
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,670
And it's very manlyand really impressive,

675
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,970
but it's really,reallybad timing.

676
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:07,320
You can't be serious.

677
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,170
Mmm. We're gonna--we're gonna be late.

678
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:16,340
Yeah,we are goingto be late.

679
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,550
Okay.

680
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,880
There is nothingmore important than family.

681
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,710
And I think it's so unfairsome are denied their god-given rightto parent

682
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,400
just because of a fewsordid incidents in their past.

683
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,980
Now 

684
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:35,460
I may have to exploresome unconventional paths to find your child.

685
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:39,640
I might even have to take actionsome might view as unsavory.

686
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,450
But before I do...

687
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,890
I need proofthat the two of you are prepared 

688
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:50,070
to facethe challenges ahead.

689
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,400
$20,000.

690
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:00,220
Is that proof enoughfor you?

691
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,170
Yes,it is.

692
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,370
Nice to meet you,young man.

693
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,180
I'm not gonna hug you.

694
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,550
I don't careif you are my grandfather.

695
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:29,540
Ah. That's okay.Hugging's not really my thing.

696
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,590
Mike,could you wait outside?

697
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,940
I'd like to be alonewith zachary.

698
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,360
Not a chance.

699
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,720
Just curious...

700
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,120
why was it so importantyou see me?

701
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,020
You're my grandson.

702
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,010
My flesh and blood.

703
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,290
Isn't it only natural I'd wanta relationship with you?

704
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:54,110
What kind of relationshipcan we have when I know you triedto kill my dad?

705
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,130
Surely,you can understand the rage I must feeltowards your father.

706
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,430
Go ahead. Feel all the rageyou wanna feel.

707
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,100
But if anythinghappens to him,

708
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,490
I swear to god you are nevergonna see me again.

709
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,730
You only met metwo minutes ago,

710
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,250
and here you are,

711
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,300
already blackmailing me.

712
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,650
I couldn't be prouder.

713
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,990
I'm serious.

714
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,760
I want you to swear you're notgonna do anything to my dad.

715
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,640
Which dad?

716
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,830
You have two of 'em.

717
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,780
You knowwho I'm talking about--

718
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,610
my dad,the man who raised me,

719
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,650
the only manI'm ever gonna care about.

720
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,250
So swear.

721
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,150
I swear.

722
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,400
Well,now thatthe ground rules have been set,

723
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,320
who's up for somemeaningless small talk?

724
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,440
well,if it isn'tthe plumber.

725
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,730
You here to see susan?

726
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,450
Uh,yeah,I just wanted to talkto her before her operation.

727
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,140
Oh?You're cutting it kinda close.

728
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,790
She's just aboutto be wheeled into surgery.

729
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,610
You know,she's dating her surgeon.

730
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,530
Yeah,she told me.

731
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:18,700
You met him?

732
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,240
Yeah.

733
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,610
He's,like,6 years old.

734
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,650
those for her?

735
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:28,200
Yeah. The floristwas having a sale on lilacs.

736
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:32,970
Dr. Ron just bought her the biggest bouquet of rosesyou've ever seen.

737
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,160
It was disgusting.

738
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,900
And the note that went with itmade my teeth hurt, it was so saccharin.

739
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:41,430
He used words like"soul mate" and "eternity."

740
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,670
I almostpuked in the vase.

741
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:47,750
What'd susan thinkabout that?

742
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:52,040
Well,she seemedto be really into it.

743
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,410
Mike!

744
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,500
Oh,wait,stop! Go back!

745
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,530
Stop! Stop a second.

746
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,290
Hey!What are you doing here?

747
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:07,230
I just,uh,wanted to wishyou luck before your surgery.

748
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,860
Aw,that's so sweet.

749
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:14,240
You came all the waydown here just for me.

750
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,850
Yep. That's why I came.

751
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:21,290
Oh,it meansa lot to me that you came.

752
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,600
Well,you take care,susan.

753
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,050
Okay.

754
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,320
Bye.

755
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,040
You forgotto give her your flowers.

756
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,970
Ah,it's no big deal.

757
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:42,980
Hi,susan. 

758
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,350
How are those drugsworking for you?You feeling good?

759
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,580
Super-duper.How you feeling?

760
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,350
Well,um,you know I want you to know,

761
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,070
what I said the other day--

762
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:57,040
that corny stuff about meholding your heart in my hands--

763
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,480
well,what I meantto say was,

764
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,150
my feelings for you--they keep growing,

765
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,680
and,uh,I think--

766
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,860
well,I hope that you feel the same way about me.Mm.

767
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,400
Ah,hell,susan.

768
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,750
I love you.

769
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:16,290
Aw,thank you.

770
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,960
I love mike.

771
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,180
Mike?

772
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,990
Susan,who's mike?

773
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:29,000
Mike is love. Mmm.

774
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,580
Who the hell is mike?

775
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,210
I don't know,but she's marriedto a guy named karl.

776
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:38,120
I'm so,so sorry.I should've told you,dr. Ron.

777
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,700
Mmm,mike,mike,mike...

778
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,480
oh,why are you alwaysfalling in love with skanks?

779
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,690
You beautiful,beautiful man!

780
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,710
Oh!

781
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:58,520
okay,we ready to go here?

782
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,980
Yeah. Sure.

783
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,570
Let's cutthis bitch open.

784
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,050
what are you doing?

785
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,600
Your lawyer left a messageon my machine.

786
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,140
It seems we havea hearing in four weeks,

787
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,150
and I wanna be ready.

788
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,560
Oh,I get it.

789
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,880
So,uh,so you're gonna pretendto be sober for the judge?

790
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,640
Oh,there's no pretending.

791
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:32,110
I am going to my first A.A. Meeting tomorrow.

792
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,010
Of course,I picked onein the worst part of town

793
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,300
so I won'trun into anybody I know.

794
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,250
Which,of course,means I will.

795
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,110
All right,so whatis that gonna prove?

796
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,240
Perception is reality,andrew.

797
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,560
And if people perceive meto have a drinking problem,

798
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,650
then I do.

799
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,270
And I certainly don't wantsome idiotic judge

800
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,520
using my hobby as an excuseto make you rich.

801
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:56,700
So I'm simplygoing to give up my wine

802
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:00,870
and becomea recovering alcoholic.

803
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,490
Good plan,but it'll never work.

804
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,470
See,I'll bet you stillend up coming to court hammered.

805
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,430
oh,andrew,you don't thinkI love you enough to 

806
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,310
give up alcohol?

807
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,800
Look,I'm 17,all right?

808
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,170
So you can only keep me herefor another year.

809
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,050
Why notjust let me go?

810
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,540
Because I'm notdone with you yet.

811
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,880
It's my job to teach you,

812
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:29,190
and you are not half the manI know you can be.

813
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,430
Yeah,well,I got news for you--

814
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:32,550
this is as goodas I'm gonna get.

815
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,730
If I really thought that,

816
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,030
I'd get a gun right nowand kill us both.

817
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,430
Mom,we're both so unhappy.

818
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,320
Why not justlet me take my trust fund,

819
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,520
and I'll getout of your hair forever?

820
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,790
Please.

821
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:52,320
You're a stone cold bitch,you know that?

822
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:06,210
I'm sorry.I didn't quite catch that.

823
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,240
I hate you.

824
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,570
You know,the oppositeof love isn't hate.

825
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,340
It's indifference.

826
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,270
And if you hate me,

827
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,570
that means you still care,

828
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,560
and we're still connected,

829
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,990
and I still have a chanceto set you right.

830
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,550
This is how bree van de kamp

831
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,320
finally came to change her weekly routine.

832
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:40,540
She still cleaned on tuesdays...

833
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,900
paid her bills on wednesdays...

834
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,650
and did her laundry on thursdays.

835
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,240
But her fridays

836
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,590
were now reserved for a meeting...

837
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,250
a special meeting

838
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,850
where she stood in front of people she didn't know...

839
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,940
my name is bree,

840
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,440
and I am an alcoholic.

841
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,740
And said things she didn't believe.

842
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,420
And afterwards,bree would come home

843
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,320
and reward herself...

844
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:20,280
on the completion of another successful week.
