00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,900
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,600
Susan took dating tips
from her 12-year-old daughter.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,700
If you want to date him, you're
going to have to ask him out.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,100
I keep hoping he'll ask me out.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,000
How's that going?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,500
Bree accidentally poisoned her husband.

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,000
I can't believe you tried to kill me.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,100
Yes, well, I feel badly about that.

9
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,000
Lynette indulged in creative parenting.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Any of you acts up, I will call Santa,
and I will tell him you want socks for Christmas.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,400
I really hate the way you talk to me.

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,003
I really hate that I spent $15,000
on your diamond necklace.

13
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:32,400
While Gabrielle indulged
in the company of her gardener.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,100
Hi, honey. You're home early.

15
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,400
And everybody is wondering...

16
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,400
Mary Alice, what did you do?

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,800
Why their best friend just killed herself.

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,000
How much do we really want
to know about our neighbors?

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,300
Everyone has a little dirty laundry.

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,800
After I died,

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,700
I began to surrender the parts of
myself that were no longer necessary.

22
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,300
My desires, beliefs, ambitions, doubts --

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,000
every trace of my humanity was discarded.

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,100
I discovered when moving through eternity,

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,700
it helps to travel lightly.

26
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,000
In fact, I held on to only one thing

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,600
my memory.

28
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,700
It's astonishing to look back
on the world I left behind

29
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,000
I remember it all --

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,800
every single detail.

31
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,500
Like my friend Bree Van De Kamp.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,400
I remember the easy confidence of her smile,

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,000
the gentle elegance of her hands,

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,100
the refined warmth of her voice.

35
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,000
But what I remember most about Bree...

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Rex, wasn't that lovely --

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,300
was the look of fear in her eyes.

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,800
Bree had started to realize
her world was unraveling,

39
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,900
and for a woman who despised loose ends,

40
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,600
that was unacceptable.

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,300
Rex. Rex. You need to get up.

42
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,300
It's not even light out.

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,000
Please hurry.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,300
If the kids see you sleeping down here,
they're going to start asking questions.

45
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,600
Let 'em ask. I don't care anymore.

46
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,800
Well, I care.

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,100
They don't need to be burden
with our marital problems

48
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,700
while we're working things out,
the least we can do is try to keep up appearances.

49
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,200
Oh, yeah. Appearances.

50
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,900
I keep forgetting about appearances.

51
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,700
Oh, Rex, you look so tired.

52
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,500
I didn't sleep.

53
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,400
This damn thing is so uncomfortable.

54
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,400
Well, why don't you move back
upstairs and sleep in our bed?

55
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,600
We're in marriage counseling, Bree.

56
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,800
I think that would confuse things.

57
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,500
It's just--

58
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,400
I miss you.

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,600
I know you do.

60
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,500
Of course, if I don't find out start getting some sleep, pretty soon

61
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,600
I'll be forced to move back upstairs out of sure exhaustion.

62
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,700
Yes, Bree was afraid of many things,

63
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,200
but if there was one thing she wasn't afraid of...

64
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,500
It was a challenge.

65
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,900
<font color=F62B97>Episode 3 : Pretty little picture

66
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,400
The day on Wisteria lane began like any other.

67
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,900
With a cup of coffee and the moring paper.

68
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,000
Just give me a second....

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,400
and while Lynette read the business section.

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,300
and Gabrielle studied the fall collections

71
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,700
and Bree searched for decorating ideas

72
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,900
Susan scanned the front page and saw something

73
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,100
that caught her eye

74
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,600
What's about time.

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,200
Be nice. I come bearing Snacks.

76
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Lynette, these cards are sticky

77
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,600
I know. Preston used the three of diamonds to took scoop jam out of the jar.

78
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,400
Gorgeous, thankful we have 49 cards to play with.

79
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,000
- Hello. Sorry I'm late
- Hey.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,700
So, Susan and I was just telling the girls, I want to throw a dinner party

81
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,000
- Really?
- Yes.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Well how long have we all lived on this street we've never done a big group thing

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,400
I think it's a great idea

84
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,600
Paul never likes to have people over but the heck with him I'm doing it.

85
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,000
So when is this shindig?

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
How about a month from tonight?

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,600
That would be the 16th. Good for everyone?

88
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Works for me. Should we all make something?

89
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,000
Oh, no. This is my party.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,400
I've been wanting to have everyone over for years.

91
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,500
I'm so happy we're finally doing this.

92
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,800
It's gonna be so much fun.

93
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,900
Hey.

94
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,800
I know. Her dinner.

95
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,200
How could we have all forgotten about this?

96
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,000
We didn't exactly forget, it's just usually when the hostess dies the party's off.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,700
Lynette

98
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,700
I'm not being flip. I'm just pointing out a reality.

99
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,700
Mary Alice was so excited about it. It's so sad.

100
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,500
I think we should go through with it.

101
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,000
Really? Wouldn't that be in poor taste?

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,700
No. It's sort of a way to honor
Mary Alice. It was so important to her

103
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,800
We could all use a fun night.

104
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,100
Well, good, because I have some new flour that I have been just dying to show off.

105
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,700
Lynette?

106
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,100
- I'm in.
- I'll make braised lamb shanks.

107
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,300
I'm still in.

108
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,300
So how many I will be cooking for?

109
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,400
Seven. Three couples and Susan.
Does that sound right?

110
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,200
No, it sounds very, very wrong.

111
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,600
- Oh
- Is there somebody you'd like to invite?

112
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,400
I have an idea.

113
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,700
A dinner party.

114
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,800
Honey, I may be working late.

115
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,400
The Dillman proposal's a complete mess.

116
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,800
No, no, you promised to be home every night this week.

117
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,900
I'll try but I can't guarantee anything.

118
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,000
This is business.

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,200
says the prince as he rides off into the sunset.

120
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Boy the movies ever get the wrong.

121
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,700
You know what your problem is?

122
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,000
You're very tense.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,700
You should go to a spa or go shopping.

124
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,500
Find a way to relax.

125
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,800
Hello?

126
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,600
Where are you?

127
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,700
Algebra.

128
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,400
You free at 4:00?

129
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,400
I'm not sure. I got track after school.

130
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,600
Well, get here as fast as you can.

131
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,500
My husband says I need to relax.

132
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,100
You, uh, want me to keep my gym clothes on like last time?

133
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,900
If you would, please.

134
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,000
A dinner party?

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,400
Yeah, it'll be fun.

136
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,200
Bree's cooking, everyone's coming.

137
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,300
You know what?
I haven't even had a chance to unpack yet, honey.

138
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,700
I just, uh, I just need to chill out for the next few days.

139
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,500
Oh, Tom.

140
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:48,100
There'll be liquor and hors d'oeuvres and grownups without children and --
and silverware.

141
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,100
Remember silverware?

142
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,400
Honey, can you take this in for me?

143
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,000
Have you heard anything I just said?

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,600
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm just -- I'm wiped out.

145
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,703
Three cities in six days -- my head is just pounding.
I'm not ready for a dinner party.

146
00:07:59,703 --> 00:08:00,800
I already got a sitter.

147
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Can you cancel her?

148
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Please?
Look, let's just stay in tomorrow night.

149
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,900
We can get a bottle of wine and rent a video,

150
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,700
and I-I just want to hang out with my best gal.

151
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,600
That's all.

152
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,000
I was looking so forward to a night out.

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,400
I know, sweetie, I'm sorry, but...

154
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,100
I'm beat.

155
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,200
I mean, do you remember what it was like to work a 60-hour week?

156
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,100
A dinner party?

157
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,800
Do I have to go?

158
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,200
Well, given that we're hosting it, I'd say so.

159
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,200
By the way, you won't be drinking at this party.

160
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,500
Why is that?

161
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,800
Because when you drink, you get chatty.

162
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,300
No one needs to know that we're seeing Dr. Goldfine.

163
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,800
You know, if you spent half as much time working on our problems as you do covering them --

164
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,000
not a drop.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,800
You know, this -- this is ridiculous.

166
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,800
And this whole thing about us taking tennis lessons?

167
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,600
Well, the nurses at your office may start wondering
why you're disappearing three times a week.

168
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,700
Tennis lessons are a plausible alibi.

169
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,900
All right so, these tennis lessons we're taking --

170
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,600
how are we doing?

171
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,900
My backhand's improving immensely,
but you're still having problems with your serve.

172
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,300
Of course.

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,100
A dinner party?

174
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,200
It's tomorrow night, so if you could just keep Julie an extra day.

175
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,600
Fine, but that's all. Brandi and I leave sunday for a week up at the cabin.

176
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,200
What cabin?

177
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,600
Brandi wanted some place where we could get away.

178
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,400
Escrow just closed yesterday.

179
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,700
You can afford a cabin, but you can't scrape up child support?

180
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,000
The check is in the mail.

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,400
Oh.
No, it's not.

182
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,500
I found my dental guard. I'm ready.

183
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Stop fighting.

184
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,000
We are being as nice as we possibly can to one another.

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,300
Like I said, stop fighting.

186
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,000
Excuse me, Brandi.

187
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,100
Do you mind?

188
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,200
Oh, okay.

189
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,000
Wait.
Susan, you're right there. You can pick it up.

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,300
I could, but she's the one who threw it.

191
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,000
Come on. Don't be petulant. Just pick up the stupid can.

192
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,600
No.

193
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,700
I can pick it up.

194
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,200
Honey, stay out of this.

195
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,000
Fine.

196
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,900
This is so typical.

197
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,300
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was that petulant, too?

198
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,300
You know what? You can pick up the damn can yourself.

199
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,300
Yeah, well, you just go to hell.

200
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,900
You want me to pick it up?

201
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,100
Uh...

202
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,200
Mrs. Warmington said she looked for mom's obituary and couldn't find it.

203
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,400
Did you put one in?

204
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,700
I've had other things on my mind, Zack.

205
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,900
But how could you not do that?

206
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,500
People are going to think we didn't care about her.

207
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,800
I doubt people will give it much thought.

208
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,700
Don't worry about it.

209
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,700
You never talk about her.

210
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,700
She hasn't even been dead a month, and it's like you've totally forgotten she ever existed.

211
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,900
It's a little early for this kind of talk.

212
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,000
Maybe when you die,

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,400
I won't put in an obituary.

214
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,400
That will be your choice to make.

215
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,500
Assuming you outlive me.

216
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,400
Mom, it's no big deal.

217
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,000
Carlos and I are driving in for the baptism.

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,800
Problem solved.

219
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,700
Okay, fine.

220
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,600
You go with aunt Maria, and I will take Nana to church.

221
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,400
Take your clothes off.

222
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,600
Uh-huh.

223
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,300
Okay. I got to go, mom.

224
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,400
Yes, right now.

225
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,800
Okay, uh, you can give me directions later. Bye.

226
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,500
Hi. How was school?

227
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,300
Got an A-minus on my biology exam.

228
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,100
You did? Mm.

229
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,000
Well, let's see what you've learned.

230
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,500
Who's that?

231
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,200
I don't know.

232
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,300
Hey, you!

233
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,600
So did Mike say anything?

234
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,200
No, but, god, you should have seen the look on his face.

235
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,700
I'm sure it's not that bad.

236
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,700
I mean, he's coming to the party, right?

237
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,200
I left three messages.

238
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,500
Oh, he's not going to come. Big surprise.

239
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,400
I did everything but foam at the mouth.

240
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
God, I hate when I get that way.

241
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,600
It's like every time I get within 10 feet of Karl,
I just become this monster.

242
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,900
You know what? It's not going to change
until you resolve your issues with that man.

243
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,600
What, you mean forgive him?

244
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,200
You know, I've lived with this bitterness
so long, I think I'd be lonely without it.

245
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Honey, get a pet.

246
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,400
See ya.

247
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,800
- Son of a --
- it's a business meeting.

248
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,200
It's a frat party.

249
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,100
Regional manager, corporate manager, head of sales.

250
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,200
Margarita, cigar, sombrero.

251
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,800
Okay.

252
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,100
Honey, what do you want me to do, sit around the hotel the whole time watching cable?

253
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,200
No. But when I say,

254
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,600
"we've been invited to a party,"

255
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,000
don't whine about your exhausting 60-hour week.

256
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,700
Put on your dancin' shoes and take the mother of your children out for a good time.

257
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,000
Fine. You know what? You're right.

258
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Let's go to that party.

259
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,900
I can't. I already canceled the sitter.

260
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,200
Okay, well, we'll throw the next one.

261
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
Throw a dinner party?

262
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,200
I don't even have time to wash my face.

263
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,100
No, you know what?

264
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,500
I'm going to go to this one.

265
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,700
You can stay home and babysit the kids.

266
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,900
Fine.

267
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,000
I can handle that.

268
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,300
Thank you.

269
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,200
Gabrielle spent her morning searching for the mysterious little girl.

270
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:22,100
Sadly for her, the mystery was solved a bit too quickly.

271
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,300
Hey.

272
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,000
What's going on?

273
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,600
Have you met Ashley?

274
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Found it!

275
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,600
Babe, this is Sheila Bukowski, our new neighbor.
They just moved into the Miller's old house.

276
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,700
My daughter left her ball in your yard.
I'm so sorry.

277
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,300
Oh, oh, no -- no problem.

278
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,800
Nice to meet you, Ashley.

279
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,200
She's shy. She doesn't say much.

280
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,800
Yeah, but I can see her little mind working away.

281
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,200
Nice meeting you.

282
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,200
Come on, Ashley.

283
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,000
Private sessions?

284
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,400
I don't understand. Why do we need private sessions?

285
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,000
Private sessions allow us to work on the personal issues of both partners.

286
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,700
Oh, well, I don't have any personal issues.

287
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,200
My only issue is that my husband wants to leave me,
and how can I work on that if he's not in the room?

288
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,100
There are things I need to discuss with Dr. Goldfine,
and I can't have you there.

289
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,600
Why?

290
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,600
I'm your wife. You can say anything in front of me.

291
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,800
All we need is a few more sessions, and I'm sure we can --

292
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,400
damn it, Bree,

293
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,100
a few more sessions isn't going to fix us.

294
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,600
This is bigger than that.

295
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,700
Why don't we do it this way?

296
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,100
Rex, you can take the first half-hour.

297
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,400
Bree, you can take the second.

298
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,400
Fine.

299
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,700
Oh, and, doctor,

300
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:30,500
if what he's about to discuss has anything to do
with adultery, prostitution, or internet pornography,

301
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,700
I would really appreciate you taking a moral hard line.

302
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,800
Hi, Ashley.

303
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,900
Remember me? We -- we met earlier.

304
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,500
Wow.

305
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,800
Aren't you the little artist? Ha ha.

306
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,600
What are those -- flamingos?

307
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,200
No.

308
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,600
Well, they're very pretty.

309
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,600
It almost looks like they're kissing.

310
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,800
Funny thing about kissing --

311
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,200
it's not just for husbands and wives.

312
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,600
Sometimes we kiss our mom or our grandpa.

313
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,900
Sometimes we even kiss our dog. Ha ha.

314
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,800
Sometimes we even kiss people who are just our friends,

315
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,400
kind of like a high-five on the lips. Right? Ha ha.

316
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,700
Uh... hey, Ash,

317
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,300
I was at the mall, and I saw this.

318
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,100
I thought you might like it.

319
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,900
She's hawaiian.

320
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,400
Her name is princess kahalua,

321
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,400
and I think it means "little waterfall,"
or "big pond" or something.

322
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,400
Okay.

323
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,300
So we're good, right?

324
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,900
Okay.

325
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,200
Well, you enjoy your new little friend,

326
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,300
and if there's anything else you need, you just let me know.

327
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,300
What I'd really like

328
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,200
is a bike.

329
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,500
Where did you find that?

330
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,700
She used this to kill herself.

331
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,800
Why would you keep it?

332
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,300
Why?

333
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,200
Because I thought we might need it someday.

334
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,600
For what?

335
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,900
Protection.

336
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,400
I want to talk about mom.

337
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,000
You need to take your medication.

338
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
We are going to talk about mom.

339
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,200
Hello, Zack.

340
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,400
I hope this isn't a bad time.

341
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,700
What can I do for you, Mrs. Van De Kamp?

342
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,700
Well, I wanted to invite you and your father to a dinner party tomorrow night.

343
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,900
I'm not sure where he is right now.

344
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,900
Oh. Well, I'm sorry it's such late notice, but, well,

345
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:33,300
we weren't sure that you and your father were ready for any kind of social engagement yet,

346
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,700
but, we're sort of throwing it in your mother's honor.

347
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Really?

348
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,700
Yes, it's just going to be a casual night with the gang.

349
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,700
We're going to eat and tell fun stories about your mom.

350
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,200
Zack... are you okay?

351
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Hello, Bree.

352
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,300
Oh, hi, Paul.
I was just --

353
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,200
I heard.

354
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,000
Thank you, but we already have plans for tomorrow.

355
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,300
Oh. That's too bad.

356
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,900
Well, I should go.

357
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,800
Thank you, Mrs. Van De Kamp.

358
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
For what, Zack?

359
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,800
Remembering my mom.

360
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,800
Mm.

361
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,500
That night, Paul gave his son something to calm his nerves,

362
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:35,200
and the next day, Gabrielle calmed her own nerves by giving something to her new best friend.

363
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,500
Here you go.

364
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:42,100
Top of the line, 3-speed, aluminum frame, handlebar ribbons, and a bell,

365
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,200
and you'll notice it's royal blue to match your pretty little eyes.

366
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,500
My eyes are green.

367
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,300
Yeah, well, you'll be cruising
so fast on this, no one will even notice.

368
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,300
It's all yours, hon.

369
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,600
Have fun.

370
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,700
What? What's wrong?

371
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,400
I don't know how to ride a bike.

372
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,600
What?

373
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Well, then, why did you ask for one?

374
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,600
Why can't you show me?

375
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,100
Ha ha. well.

376
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,300
Sure, one of these days.

377
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,800
What's wrong with now?

378
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,400
After her talk with Lynette,

379
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,300
Susan decided to take a look at her old photo album,

380
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,100
and she began to see herself in a whole new light,

381
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,300
and the picture wasn't flattering.

382
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,800
Yeah, you got Karl. Leave a message.

383
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,900
Hey, Karl, it's me.

384
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,000
I was hoping you'd be there.

385
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,300
Um, listen, we need to talk,

386
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,700
so maybe when you drop Julie off tomorrow,

387
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,100
we could have a moment.

388
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,000
It's important.

389
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,500
Give my best to...

390
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,000
Brandi.

391
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,500
Call me.

392
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,900
Susan was proud of herself.

393
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,900
She was finally ready to let go of her anger.

394
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,600
Well...

395
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,800
almost.

396
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,400
The boys will be hungry at 5:30,

397
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,300
so put the fish sticks in the toaster oven at 5:00.

398
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,900
For half an hour.
Honey, I know. This is the third time you've told me.

399
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,600
Well, if the food's late, god help you.

400
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,700
Beautiful, I don't need a pamphlet.

401
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,000
It's not brain surgery.

402
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,300
They're just kids, for god sake.

403
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,500
Preston, would you come here?

404
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,200
Yeah?

405
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,600
Sweetie,

406
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,700
you know our rule about eating cookies, right?

407
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,000
Yeah, we can't have them after 5:00
'cause sugar makes us hyper.

408
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,900
Yeah, but tonight, anything goes.

409
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,000
Make sure you share with your brothers.

410
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,700
Thanks, mom.

411
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,500
Don't look at your feet.
Don't look at your feet.

412
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,200
Look at the road.
Look at the road. Good.

413
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,900
Ow. Okay.

414
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,300
Find your balance.
Find your balance.

415
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,000
Okay, it's all you.
It's all you!
You're doing great!

416
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,200
Okay, stay to the right.
Watch the car.

417
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,000
Watch the car!
Watch the car!

418
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,800
Oh, god.

419
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,900
Oh! Are you okay?

420
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,000
Yeah. Let's go again.

421
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Oh, honey, these heels don't have another block in them.

422
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
What about tomorrow?

423
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,300
Well, you won't be around tomorrow, 'cause you have school.

424
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,700
I'm homeschooled.

425
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,500
I'm always around.

426
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:57,400
It was in that moment that Gabrielle realized this ride was far from over.

427
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,800
I'm coming!

428
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,600
Karl, what are you doing here?
I asked you to come tomorrow.

429
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,500
You said you wanted to talk.
It sounded important.

430
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,100
Tomorrow.
I'm in a towel.

431
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,100
We were married 14 years.

432
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,900
I know what's under there.
Come on.

433
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,800
I'm not really ready for this.

434
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,100
I was going to have a whole speech prepared.

435
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
Brandi and I have plans tomorrow.

436
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,700
I suggest you wing it.

437
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,100
um, okay.

438
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,300
Here's the thing, Karl --

439
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,100
I was thinking about what happened in the driveway yesterday,

440
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,800
and... I-I just don't want to --

441
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,900
I don't want to live like that.

442
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,400
I don't want to be that kind of person,

443
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,800
and I just thought if the two of us,
you know, if we had a nice, calm --

444
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,700
I need an apology, Karl.

445
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,300
A what?

446
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,400
An apology for the way you ended our marriage.

447
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,100
You never took any responsibility for your behavior.

448
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,200
I don't know what to say, Susan.

449
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,600
The heart wants what it wants.

450
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,100
What does that mean?

451
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,700
I fell in love.

452
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,700
While you were married to someone else.

453
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,700
The heart wants what it wants.

454
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,100
Yeah, well, my heart wants to hurt you,
but I can control myself.

455
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,800
I-I don't want to go back to that ugly place, really,

456
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,300
and if you do, I suggest that you get some help.

457
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,900
You know what?

458
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,900
I don't need an apology.

459
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,900
I don't need anything from you.

460
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,600
You're humiliating yourself.

461
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,800
No, you're the one who's been humiliated, Karl.

462
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,200
Why don't you see that?

463
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
You walked out on your family.

464
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,800
People think you're scum, not me,

465
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,100
so worry about yourself.
I'm okay with me.

466
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,200
I can walk down the street and hold my head high.

467
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,200
As the sun slowly settled on Wisteria lane,

468
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,800
an unsettled Susan racked her brain to find a way into her own house.

469
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Aah!

470
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,700
Lying naked in her shrubs,

471
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:16,000
it occurred to Susan this could be the most humiliating moment of her life.

472
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,600
Susan?

473
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
She was wrong.

474
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,000
Uh, whatcha doing?

475
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
Locked myself out...

476
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,800
naked.

477
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,500
Oh.

478
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,400
And then I fell.

479
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,600
So how are you?

480
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Good, good.

481
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,100
I just got back.

482
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,000
I've been gone all day, and I got your messages about dinner,

483
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,500
and, um, I would love to come if that invite still stands.

484
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,800
It's a date.

485
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
All right. I, um...

486
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,200
assume the dress is casual.

487
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,500
Yeah. It's -- it's casual.

488
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,200
Mm-hmm.

489
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,900
Thanks for helping me break in.

490
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,100
Do you think it'll be hard to replace that screen?

491
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,900
It depends.

492
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,700
If you nail it in yourself, you might want to wear gloves...

493
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,500
or pants. Pants wouldn't hurt.

494
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,900
Okay, I know what just happened is funny in theory,

495
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,500
but I'm nowhere near ready to laugh about it,
so please, no jokes.

496
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,000
Hey, where have you two been?

497
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,300
Uh, Susan had a problem finding something to wear.

498
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,600
Oh, is that the kind of thing you meant?

499
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,800
Pretty much.

500
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,900
The kids are bouncing off the walls? Huh.

501
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,900
Well, I'm sure you can figure a way to put them to bed, Tom.

502
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,800
I mean, for god sakes, Tom, they're just kids.

503
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,900
Hey. Are you okay?

504
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,500
Yes, I-I went jogging today,

505
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,700
and I think I just pushed myself too hard.

506
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,100
Oh, you're probably not wearing the right shoes.

507
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,100
Yeah, that thought did cross my mind.

508
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,100
So Gabrielle says that you and Bree are taking lessons three times a week.

509
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,700
Uh-huh.

510
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm actually thinking about playing again.
I mean, it's such great exercise.

511
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,400
Mm. That it is.

512
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,200
And my drop shot could use a serious tune-up.

513
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,500
Think you can give me the number of your pro?

514
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,800
Yeah. I'll, uh,
I'll give it to you later.

515
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,500
Well, what club does he work out of?

516
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,900
Um...

517
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,900
w-we're not really taking tennis lessons, carlos.

518
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,500
You're not?

519
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,900
That's a story

520
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,900
Bree concocted to cover the fact that we're seeing a marriage counselor.

521
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,500
Bree -- Bree...

522
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,200
he wouldn't stop asking about the tennis pro.

523
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,500
Bree and I are in marriage counseling.

524
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,900
Everyone knows our secret now.

525
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,300
Did the sky fall?

526
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,000
Has your life come crashing down?

527
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,300
If everybody would please take your seats,

528
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,400
dinner is served.

529
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:15,300
With the winds from the northwest at 4 miles per hour,
it's currently 55 degrees.

530
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,000
Now we go to rich... live on the scene in westbrook.

531
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,700
A grisly discovery was made today in westbrook
when a chest was found in rockwater lake,

532
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,500
discovered by a local area businessman and his grandson while they were fishing.

533
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,300
Investigators recovered a wooden chest
containing what appears to be human remains.

534
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,600
Now, a police spokesman says the body was --

535
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,500
Okay, I got to break the ice here.

536
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,300
So you're in counseling. Big deal.

537
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,600
You want humiliation? I'll give you humiliation.

538
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,100
I locked myself out of my house stark naked and got caught by Mike.

539
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,800
Oh, my god. When did this happen?

540
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,100
Today, right before the party.

541
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,100
What can I say?
Right place, right time.

542
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,200
I think I can top that. Try getting thrown out of disneyland for lewd behavior.

543
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,600
What? When was this?

544
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,000
When Tom and I were first married, things got
a little out of hand on Mr. Toad's wild ride.

545
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,800
You're kidding.

546
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,500
No. We got perp walked
down main street, USA.

547
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,300
Well, since we're doing true confessions,

548
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,700
Carlos and I once broke a waterbed in Cancoon.

549
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,400
How'd you manage that?

550
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,500
Well, he used to have a thing for spiked heels.

551
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,700
I'd just like to make it clear -- she was wearing them.

552
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,100
Rex cries after he ejaculates.

553
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,100
You think we left too early?

554
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,800
I was thinking we left too late.

555
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,300
So is, uh,
Rex gone for good?

556
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,900
I don't know.

557
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,800
God, I hope not.

558
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,100
I mean, they've always been wound a little
tight, but I've never seen them like that.

559
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,700
Then again, who am I to judge?

560
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,100
You mean people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw soda cans?

561
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:03,100
Okay, you have got to know that
I only get that angry around Karl.

562
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,000
He just treated me so badly at the end.

563
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,300
I haven't been able to get past it.

564
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,400
Well, maybe he did you a big favor.

565
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,500
What do you mean?

566
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,600
Let's look at Karl as a starter marriage -- you know, boot camp.

567
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,900
Preparing you for something better next time.

568
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,600
Listen, Mike...

569
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,500
about the whole seeing me naked thing, I...

570
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:30,500
I don't -- I just want to thank you for being such A... perfect gentleman.

571
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,600
Oh, I wasn't a perfect gentleman.
I might have snuck a peek.

572
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Oh.

573
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,800
Good night.

574
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,500
And, um, for what it's worth...

575
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,000
Wow.

576
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,100
Hi.

577
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,200
How was your night?

578
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,600
We are raising little terrorists.
You know that, don't you?

579
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,000
Oh. You didn't have a good time?

580
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,900
Okay, you know what? Drop the act.

581
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,300
I know you gave them cookies.

582
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,400
Oh. Who cracked, anyway?

583
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,100
Porter.

584
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,800
Oh.

585
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
So how was your, uh, dinner party?

586
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,600
Well, there was dinner, but it wasn't much of a party.

587
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,200
Uh-oh. What happened?

588
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
I don't know.

589
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,900
Rex announced that he and Bree are in counseling.

590
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:34,200
She retaliated with this whole revelation
which I won't even go into now,

591
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,500
and the bottom line is he stormed out.

592
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,700
Clearly, there's trouble in paradise.

593
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,400
Honestly, I'm not that surprised.

594
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
Why not?

595
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,400
I don't know. I just never got the idea that they were really happy.

596
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,600
Are we happy?

597
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,800
Man, oh, man.

598
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,900
I keep seeing that look on Rex's face,

599
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,800
and then him taking off like that.

600
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,000
Some night.

601
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,600
Then again, I would probably cry, too, if I had to have sex with that woman.

602
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,900
I mean, you watch a man get torn down like that,

603
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,000
it makes you wonder why he let her get away with it.

604
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,700
Believe me, if a woman ever humiliated me like that in public,

605
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,900
hm-- it would only happen once.

606
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,800
So, uh, where are you going?

607
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,700
I'll be staying at the motor lodge.

608
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,900
The hotel by the interstate has better rates,
and it's closer to your work.

609
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,100
Fine.

610
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,400
I'm packing your swimsuit.

611
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,600
There's a pool there,
and I know how swimming relaxes you.

612
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,000
When our kids ask where I am,
what are you going to say?

613
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,200
Um...

614
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,600
I could tell them that you went to tennis camp.

615
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
That was a joke.

616
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,600
Yeah. I got it.

617
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,400
Ah. There.

618
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,000
Obviously, if you've forgotten anything,
you can, um, come right back and get it.

619
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,400
Well, I'll call you.

620
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,100
Rex.

621
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,600
In college, when we first started dating,

622
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,000
people were so jealous of us.

623
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
We were the golden couple.

624
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,900
Everybody knew we were going to have this wonderful life.

625
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,500
Why is this happening?

626
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,300
Because you can't even let me pack my own suitcase.

627
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,500
All right, see ya. Have fun.

628
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,200
Hey.

629
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,000
Where are you going?

630
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,800
Just a sec.

631
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Mom?

632
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,900
Don't worry. I'm not packing heat.

633
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,600
Hey, Brandi, would you scoot a little?

634
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,200
Just scoot. Thank you.

635
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Hi.

636
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,700
What are you doing?

637
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,700
I'll be quick.

638
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,400
Brandi, I'm sorry for the way I treated you.

639
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,200
It was uncalled for and childish, and it won't happen again.

640
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,500
I have built up a lot of anger towards you, both of you,

641
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,400
and I realize now that I just can't carry that around anymore,

642
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,700
so apology or no apology,

643
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,600
I'm moving on.

644
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,800
Mrs. Mayer?

645
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,300
Brandi.

646
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,300
Brandi, get in the car.

647
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,600
Mrs. Mayer.

648
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,900
Please, call me Susan.

649
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,200
I just wanted you to know

650
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,500
what happened between me and Karl, things got out of hand

651
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,300
because I thought your marriage was over.

652
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,400
Anyway, I just wanted you to know I'm sorry. I really am.

653
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,000
Thank you.

654
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,000
And though it came from an unexpected source,

655
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,900
Susan finally got the apology she'd always wanted.

656
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Hey. Let me take those.

657
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,800
You're wearing a really big hat.

658
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,900
Yes, I am.

659
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,000
Listen, the kids are watching a video,

660
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,200
which means that we've got only about 45 minutes
until they actually find nemo,

661
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,000
so I suggest that we make the most of it.

662
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,300
By reliving your night out with the guys?

663
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,400
Lynette...

664
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,600
I'm trying.

665
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,200
You look...
ridiculous in that thing.

666
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Sexy ridiculous?

667
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,400
Maybe.

668
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,200
I can live...

669
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,600
with maybe.

670
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,400
Oh.

671
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:39,600
You know, it's going to take more than just this one night.

672
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,200
I know.

673
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,900
Ah.

674
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,000
Looks like we have an audience.

675
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,200
Let 'em look.

676
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,700
As long as they don't try and cut in.

677
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,200
Dr. Goldfine.

678
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Bree. We're not scheduled now, are we?

679
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,700
I didn't have time to make an appointment.

680
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,000
Rex moved out today.

681
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,500
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that,

682
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,000
but unfortunately, I'm completely booked right now.

683
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,800
I don't need much time.

684
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,400
It just seems that you have more insight into my situation

685
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,500
than I do, and I just think --

686
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,600
Bree, we can't talk now.

687
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,000
If you could just tell me what he told you, then I could fix the problem.

688
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,400
I can't do that.
It's completely unethical.

689
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,300
Well, why can't you --

690
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,000
that's my next appointment.

691
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,100
You really need to go.

692
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,600
Dr. Goldfine, please.

693
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,400
Hold on.
I'll go and talk to my client.

694
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:15,500
Bree searched for Rex's audiotape hoping to find answers.

695
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,400
She found answers, all right,

696
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,400
but to entirely different questions.

697
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,400
I understand completely.

698
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,800
I'll -- I'll be out in just a minute.

699
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,500
Bree, I'm -- I'm sorry. He can't wait,

700
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,300
but I can see you first thing in the morning -- 8:00.

701
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,600
8:00.

702
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,700
Sorry to interupt.

703
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,700
Bye.

704
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:56,500
Yes, I remember the world --every detail.

705
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,900
And what I remember most is how afraid I was.

706
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,000
What a waste.

707
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,300
You see, to live in fear is not to live at all.

708
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,400
I wish I could tell this to those I left behind,

709
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,400
but would it do any good?

710
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,600
Probably not.

711
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,800
I understand now --

712
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,700
there will always be those who face their fears...

713
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:33,600
and there will always be those who run away.

714
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:43,600
