1
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,300
If Mary alice was having some sort of crisis,we'd have known.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,802
She lives 50 feet away, for god's sakes.

3
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,388
Gabby, the woman killed herlf.

4
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,015
Something must have been going on.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
Every time I'm around that man, he tries to grab my ass.

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:21,188
I made over $200,000 doing business with him last year.

7
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,107
If he wants to grab your ass, you let him.

8
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,610
Why aren't you happy?

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,613
Turns out I wanted all the wrong things.

10
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,110
What's that?

11
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,112
It's a letter addressed to Mary Alice.

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,083
Oh, Mary Alice, what did you do?

13
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,299
An odd thing happens when we die.

14
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,093
Our senses vanish.

15
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:54,096
Taste, touch, smell, and sound become a distant memory,

16
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,890
but our sight --

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,518
ah, our sight expands,

18
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:03,188
and we can suddenly see the world we've left behind so clearly.

19
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:07,192
Of course, most of what's visible to the dead could also be seen by the living,

20
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,697
if they'd only take the time to look.

21
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,907
Like my friend Gabrielle.

22
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,910
I should have seen how unhappy she was, but I didn't.

23
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:21,290
I only saw her clothes from Paris...

24
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,585
and her platinum jewelry...

25
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,380
and her brand-new diamond watch.

26
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,591
Had I looked closer,

27
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,302
I'd have seen that Gabrielle was a drowning woman

28
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:36,013
desperately in search of a life raft.

29
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:39,016
Luckily for her, she found one.

30
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,519
Of course, Gabrielle only saw her young gardener

31
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,480
as a way to infuse her life with a little excitement.

32
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,401
But now she was about to discover just how exciting her life could get.

33
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,404
But now she was about to discover just how exciting her life could get.

34
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,920
Damn it.

35
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,297
Come on, come on, come on! Hurry up! Let's go!

36
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:13,300
Come on, come on!

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,801
Where are the rest of my clothes?

38
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,595
I'll find them. Just get out.

39
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:17,679
Where?

40
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,682
- Out the window.
- What?

41
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,521
Go, go, go, go, go!

42
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,985
Hi, honey. You're home early.

43
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,988
My meeting got canceled.

44
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,409
Didn't you take a shower this morning?

45
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,995
I, uh, I just finished a workout.

46
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,705
Where's John?

47
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,290
John?

48
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,918
Yeah. That's his truck out front.

49
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,711
Gabrielle was panicked.

50
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,089
She knew if her husband discovered her secret,

51
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,092
she would feel the full force of his wrath.

52
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,012
Hey, mr. Solis.

53
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,807
Hey, John, take care of that ficus yet?

54
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,810
- I'll get to it as soon as I'm done here.
- All right.

55
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,107
- But she was quickly reminded that...
- Yeah, sure.

56
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,110
- what Carlos couldn't see...
- No problem.

57
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,406
Couldn't hurt her.

58
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:00,616
Episode 2 - Ah, but underneath

59
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:08,207
The peaceful facade of Wisteria Lane had recently been shattered,

60
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,503
first by my suicide...

61
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:16,006
and then by the discovery of...

62
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:21,220
a note among my belongings that suggested a suspicious reason for my desperate act.

63
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,015
My friends gathered to discuss its implications.

64
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,808
I think we should give it to Paul.

65
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,811
He's still mourning, Susan. He'll probably freak out.

66
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,898
It doesn't matter. She was his wife. He deserves to have all the facts.

67
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,317
Well, we could do it gently.

68
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,903
We could tell him about it over coffee and pastry.

69
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,112
That would be fun.

70
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,906
"Paul, we have proof your wife killed herself

71
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,200
over some deep, dark secret. Another bear claw?"

72
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,203
We could always call the police.

73
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,080
Maybe it's just some sort of sick joke.

74
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,415
Well, if it was a joke, it was in very poor taste.

75
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,210
No, this was serious. I know it was.

76
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,295
We got to find out what was going on.

77
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,298
Let's say we do. There's a chance we're not going to like what we find.

78
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,592
Well, isn't it worse to be in the dark?

79
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,303
I mean, imagining she did all these horrible things.

80
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,806
It's the age-old question, isn't it?

81
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,809
How much do we really want to know about our neighbors?

82
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,903
My friends were right to be concerned.

83
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:24,408
They knew that every family has its secrets,

84
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,787
and as my son and husband could have told them,

85
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:33,292
you need to think carefully before digging them up.

86
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,186
After talking for hours,

87
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:55,189
my friends still hadn't agreed on what to do with the note.

88
00:05:56,315 --> 00:06:01,320
So they decided to talk about it in the morning after a good night's rest.

89
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,782
But no one could sleep that night.

90
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:10,204
They each kept thinking of my suicide

91
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,707
and how terribly alone I must have felt.

92
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:21,089
You see, loneliness was something my friends understood all too well.

93
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,307
It's okay. I'm up.

94
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,100
Good.

95
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,103
I have a question for you.

96
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,319
Do you remember when you proposed?

97
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,403
For god's sake --

98
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,406
We sat on skyline drive and drank a bottle of apple wine,

99
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,284
and when we finished it, you turned to me, and you said,

100
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,787
"if you marry me, Bree Mason,

101
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,790
I promise to love you for the rest of my life."

102
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,919
And even though I was engaged to Ty Grant, and even though my father didn't like you,

103
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,504
I said yes.

104
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:01,880
That was a long time ago.

105
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,508
You're going to cancel the meeting with that divorce lawyer,

106
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,593
and we're going to find ourselves a marriage counselor.

107
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,596
- Bree --
- You promised.

108
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:20,607
All right.

109
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,610
Good. I'm going to go, uh, make myself some warm milk.

110
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:29,283
Would you like something to drink?

111
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:32,286
Anything but apple wine.

112
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,419
Susan awoke that night alone and parched,

113
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,588
but as she gazed out her window,

114
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:46,592
she saw the tall drink of water she needed to quinch her thirst.

115
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,721
"dear diary, Mike doesn't even know I'm alive."

116
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,014
Shut up.

117
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:54,600
If you want to date him, you're going to have to ask him out.

118
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,019
I keep hoping he'll ask me out.

119
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,395
How's that going?

120
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,814
Shouldn't you be making brownies for your nerdy friends?

121
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,108
I can't find the measuring cup. Have you seen it?

122
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,819
The measuring cup?

123
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,321
Yeah.

124
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,915
I -- well, it's -- it's got to be here somewhere. Just keep looking.

125
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,505
I know you're awake.

126
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,590
I know you're a jerk.

127
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,593
Dinner with Tanaka ran long. I'm sorry.

128
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:33,680
You know, Carlos, I didn't marry you so I could have dinner by myself six times a week.

129
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,390
You know how bored I was today?

130
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,684
I came this close to actually cleaning the house.

131
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,895
Don't be that way. I got you a gift.

132
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,396
Nope. No, no, no, no.

133
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,399
You're not going to buy your way out of this one.

134
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,612
It's a good gift.

135
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,619
Is that white gold?

136
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:58,580
Yeah. Put it on...

137
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,708
and then make love to me.

138
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,920
I'm not in the mood.

139
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,881
But we could stay up and talk.

140
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,510
When a man buys a womaexpensive jewelry,

141
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,513
there are many things he may want in return for future reference,

142
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,016
conversation ain't one of them.

143
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,812
- Hey, that was a joke.
- Yeah, right.

144
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,103
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Let go of me.

145
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:29,117
Hey, you've been acting like a nightmare for a month. What's wrong?

146
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,614
I can't fix it unless you tell me.

147
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,581
It's not exciting anymore, Carlos.

148
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,711
So what am I supposed to do?

149
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,006
I don't know.

150
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,383
Be the way you used to be.

151
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,386
Surprise me. Take my breath away.

152
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,683
Okay.

153
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:20,204
Hey, Susan.

154
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,415
What's wrong?

155
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:27,211
I didn't realize anybody was going to be out here. I just sort of rolled out of bed.

156
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:30,214
I'm sure you look fine.

157
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,096
Oh, Bongo, stop.

158
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:43,018
Sorry, uh... he scares easy.

159
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,979
No, it-- it's fine.

160
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,398
I-I get it. I didn't mean to disturb you.

161
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,401
I'll see you later.

162
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,614
Do you want to have dinner with me?

163
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:59,618
Just the two of us?

164
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:02,788
Well... and Julie.

165
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:05,791
It's a thing we do when somebody new moves into the neighborhood,

166
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,794
we invite them over for a home-cooked meal. Sort of a tradition.

167
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,797
I thought you said you were a lousy cook.

168
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,507
Well, I order takeout.

169
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,009
Oh, you invite them over for home cooking and give them takeout.

170
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,012
Yeah, it's -- it's -- it's sort of a new tradition.

171
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:22,099
I'm working out the kinks.

172
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:27,104
I'll tell you what -- how about I cook and you guys come over to my place?

173
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,815
Great.

174
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,984
Friday night at 6:00?

175
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:33,986
I'll be there.

176
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:36,905
All right. Come on

177
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,908
Bye, Bongo.

178
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,418
Julie!

179
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,712
Mike Delfino just invited us to dinner friday night.

180
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,297
He did? Cool.

181
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:56,091
But only I'm going, because you're going to come down with something semi-serious

182
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:59,094
that requires bed rest and fluids.

183
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,390
Julie was glad Susan was rekindling her love life.

184
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:07,186
Of course, she was unaware of her mother's recent track record with fire.

185
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:09,980
It's all gone --

186
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,983
everything my ex-husband worked for all those years.

187
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,902
Gone.

188
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:15,903
Well, don't worry about clothing.

189
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,906
I already started a collection from people in the neighborhood.

190
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:23,118
What? I don't want to wear other people's old crap.

191
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:27,080
Edie, you can be homeless, or you can be ungracious. You really can't afford to be both.

192
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,584
That reminds me -- my insurance check still hasn't come yet.

193
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,712
Can I stay with you for a few more weeks?

194
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:38,717
Of course. What kind of christian would I be if I denied shelter to a friend in need?

195
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,596
Oh, look, here's something we can salvage.

196
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,182
Your measuring cup.

197
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:48,185
We can just scrape off the burnt part, and it'll look good as new.

198
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,189
That's not my cup. Mine was plastic.

199
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,608
Well, how did it get in here?

200
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,611
I don't know. Who cares?

201
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,619
Now, would you put that down and start looking for jewelry?

202
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:15,420
Dr. Albert Goldfein was the most accomplished marriage counselor in the city.

203
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,300
He had dealt with problems ranging from substance abuse

204
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,304
to infidelity

205
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:28,600
to domestic violence.

206
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:33,397
Yes, dr. Goldfine thought he had seen it all,

207
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:37,192
and then he met the Van de Kamps.

208
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,696
Hi. I'm Bree, and this is my husband Rex...

209
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,616
and I brought you some homemade potpourri.

210
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,912
The answer is yes.

211
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,915
You're about to make a fortune off of us.

212
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,714
Guys, I'm very --

213
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:01,008
Sit in your seats.

214
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,010
I am not going to tell you again!

215
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,013
Buckle up!

216
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,683
I mean it, so help me, I will --

217
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:15,314
Crap!

218
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:22,321
Licenses, registration, ma'am.

219
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,616
Ma'am, you know why I pulled you over?

220
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,117
I have a theory.

221
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:30,120
The kids are jumping up and down. They should be sitting, wearing their seat belts.

222
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:34,499
I don't let them -- they don't even listen to me. It's very frustrating.

223
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:39,505
Well, you have to find a way to control them. After all, that's your job.

224
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,799
Though he'd been a policeman for six years,

225
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,804
officer Hayes had never found himself in a truly dangerous situation.

226
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:52,100
Then again, he had never before told a woman how to raise her children.

227
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,814
Are you saying I'm a bad mother?

228
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,900
Ma'am, you need to get back in your car, please.

229
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,612
I have no help. My husband's always away on business.

230
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,489
I'm going to have to ask you to step back now.

231
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,492
My babysitter joined the witness relocation program.

232
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,995
I haven't slept through the night in six years,

233
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,998
and for you to stand there and judge me...

234
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:30,180
I'm not going to give you a ticket.

235
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:33,308
I'm just going to let you off with a warning.

236
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:37,104
I accept your apology.

237
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,489
Buckle up.

238
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,396
Mrs. Solis.

239
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:22,399
Hello, Jonathan.

240
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,693
Well, this is my room.

241
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,195
Sorry about the mess.

242
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:29,198
Ah, don't worry about it.

243
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:32,409
You just missed my mom. Friday she coaches my little sister's soccer team.

244
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,205
Oh, yes. I heard that.

245
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:39,208
Um, John, we need to talk about what happened the other day.

246
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:42,586
Mr. Solis isn't starting to catch on, is he?

247
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,589
No, no, he doesn't have a clue, god love him.

248
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:52,221
It's just that when you come over to garden, you might actually have to garden.

249
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,892
Great. You're breaking up with me

250
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,019
in my own bedroom.

251
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,897
No, no, no. I'm not dumping you.

252
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:04,900
Lately you've been the only thing keeping me going.

253
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:08,111
It's just we can't do it at my house anymore.

254
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:11,490
So, then, where do you want to do it?

255
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,493
Well, what time does your mom get back from soccer practice?

256
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,080
Mrs. Solis.

257
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,083
Better hurry. We don't have a lot of time.

258
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,683
And so there's just the four of us.

259
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:40,686
My older son Andrew is 16, Danielle is 15, and --

260
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,897
I don't need to see pictures. Bree,

261
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,900
you've spent most of the hour engaging in small talk.

262
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:48,986
Oh, have I?

263
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:52,990
Yes. Rex has been very vocal about his issues.

264
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:58,287
Don't you want to discuss your feelings about your marriage?

265
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:07,504
Doc, um... this is the thing you got to know about Bree --

266
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,506
she doesn't like to talk about her feelings.

267
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:12,509
To be honest, it's hard to know if s has any.

268
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:17,306
Does she feel anger, rage, ecstasy?

269
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,016
Who knows?

270
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:22,019
She's always pleasant,

271
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:25,606
and I can't tell you how annoying that is.

272
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:32,988
Whatever she feels, it's so far below the surface, no one can see it.

273
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,493
I feel like she's using all these...

274
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,793
What?

275
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,504
Uh, I'm sorry.

276
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:51,507
Would you like to respond to what Rex just said?

277
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,802
Is there some truth there?

278
00:18:55,802 --> 00:19:00,807
Do you use housework as a way to disengage emotionally?

279
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:03,894
Of course not.

280
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,689
Ah. This is great.

281
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,983
I've got tons of homework tonight.

282
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,194
It's so easy to concentrate after sex.

283
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:15,197
I'm glad I could help. Education is very important.

284
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,408
Oh, I got something for you.

285
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,410
I was going to give it to you next time I mowed your lawn,

286
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,413
but since you're here...

287
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,792
Oh, it's a rose.

288
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:28,418
It's not just any rose.

289
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:31,380
Look at all the petals. There's no floss. It's perfect.

290
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,508
Oh, John.

291
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,385
Just like you.

292
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:38,595
The truth hit her like a thunderbolt.

293
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,598
I spent days looking for just the right one. I finally found it.

294
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:45,102
For John, this was no longer a meaningless little affair.

295
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:50,399
Gabrielle could now clearly see he was falling in love with her.

296
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,902
It's just beautiful.

297
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:57,906
I...

298
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:00,909
I got to go.

299
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,495
Goodbye.

300
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,421
So what are we having?

301
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:15,382
Uh, well, I talked to Julie, and -- thanks. And she suggested rib eye steaks.

302
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,092
She said that's your favorite.

303
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,011
Oh, yeah, I love my steak.

304
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:23,599
Hi, Mike. Susan.

305
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:29,688
Hey, I'm sorry about your house. How you holding up?

306
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:32,691
All right, I guess.

307
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,693
Oh, is somebody having a party?

308
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:37,696
No, Susan's just throwing me one of her traditional welcome-to-the-neighborhood dinners,

309
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,615
only I'm cooking...

310
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:42,618
and having it at my house.

311
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:45,621
Ha ha. Traditional, huh? I didn't get one.

312
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,582
Oh, it's sort of a new tradition.

313
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:51,585
Well, it won't be anything fancy. Just a little home cooking.

314
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:53,712
That sounds so good.

315
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:57,591
Susan suddenly had an awful feeling in the pit of her stoma...

316
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,594
I've been having nothing but fast food lately.

317
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,805
As if she was watching an accident in slow motion.

318
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:09,311
She knew it would happen, but was powerless to stop it.

319
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,818
Edie, would you like to join us for dinner?

320
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,987
Oh, that's so sweet.

321
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,907
No, I don't want to intrude. Three's a crowd.

322
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:24,910
No, it's not like that. I mean, Susan's bringing Julie.

323
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:27,788
Yeah, it's not like that.

324
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:30,082
The more, the merrier.

325
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:32,084
- Well, this will be fun.
- All right.

326
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:35,087
- Tomorrow night.We'll eat at 6:00.
- Great.

327
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:38,799
Oh, and, Susan...
- Yeah.

328
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,802
This will make up for the dinner that you never threw me.

329
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:44,888
Right. Ha ha.

330
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,683
Should I have told her we were having steak?

331
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,893
She's not, like, a vegetarian or something, is she?

332
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,396
Oh, no, no.

333
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:55,399
No, edie's definitely a carnivore.

334
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:01,905
Here's, um...

335
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,991
Here's what I pulled for Edie.

336
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,910
I should warn you that most of the clothes in there aren't that stylish.

337
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,496
Oh, don't worry about it. Edie's a beggar now,

338
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,915
which means she can'be a chooser.

339
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,918
Of course, we don't have to add salt to the wound.

340
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:18,213
Listen, I was just getting dinner ready.

341
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:19,381
Say no more.

342
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:22,009
- I'll get out of your hair.
- No, no.

343
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:26,013
By the way, was that you I saw getting pulled over by a policeman?

344
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,016
Yeah, the boys were acting up in the car,

345
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,018
and I couldn't get them to sit down.

346
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,103
Young boys can be so willful.

347
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,813
I try everything.

348
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:38,817
I scream, I threaten, I reason, I beg. Nothing works.

349
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:42,487
I don't know if it's because they're too young and they don't understand,

350
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:46,491
or if they're just getting some perverse joy out of testing me.

351
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,203
My mother used to have the worst time with me in the car,

352
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:51,914
so one time when I was acting up, she stopped

353
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:54,917
and left me on the side of the road, and she drove off.

354
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:58,587
You're kidding.

355
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:00,506
Oh, she came back immediately,

356
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,883
but I never misbehaved in the car again.

357
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:04,384
You should try that.

358
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:08,180
Mrs. Huber, I could never leave my kids by the side of the road.

359
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,183
When it comes to discipline, sometimes you must be creative.

360
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,810
My mother knew that. Smart lady.

361
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,604
Of course, she's in a home now,

362
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:18,607
and her mind has just turned to mush.

363
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,403
Well, like I said, I should go back and get dinner ready.

364
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:26,406
Oh, right, right.

365
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,409
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

366
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,996
Susan, have you been able to find old clothes for Edie?

367
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,915
She has nothing to wear.

368
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:37,417
I thought that was the look she was going for.

369
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,585
Oh, Susan.

370
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:41,588
Edie may be trash, but she's still a human being.

371
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:57,813
Zach? Is your dad home?

372
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:00,816
I need to talk to him.

373
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:09,283
- Hey, Paul.
- Hey.

374
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:10,701
Hope I'm not interrupting.

375
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:13,704
Actually, I was getting ready to go somewhere.

376
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,790
I just wanted to come by and say hello, you know,

377
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,208
see how you guys a doing.

378
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,919
We're trying to move on. It's been pretty tough.

379
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:23,881
Yeah, I could only imagine.

380
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:25,883
I mean, not knowing why Mary Alice...

381
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:27,509
Why what?

382
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:30,095
Why she did it. Oh, here, let me help you.

383
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:33,098
I've got it, I've got it.

384
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:42,399
I'm sorry if I upset you.

385
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:44,193
Can I be frank?

386
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:45,402
Of course.

387
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:47,321
I don't care what her reasons were.

388
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,489
Maybe she was depressed, maybe she was bored.

389
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,116
It doesn't matter.

390
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:55,120
She abandoned her husband and her son, and I'll never forgive her.

391
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:15,891
As I watched Ssusan, I couldn't help feeling sorry for her.

392
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:19,895
She wanted so much to know why I did it...

393
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:25,484
Why I killed myself.

394
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,113
It's not enough to want the truth.

395
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:34,117
You must know where to look for it.

396
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:41,083
And the truth is elusive, because it knows where to hide.

397
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:49,883
Hello, Julie.

398
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,719
I talked to your mom about donating some clothes for Edie.

399
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,680
She's at mrs. Van de Kamp's,

400
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,683
but I'll see if she left some stuff upstairs.

401
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:34,511
I-I was, um, just admiring your new measuring cup.

402
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,389
Yeah, we lost ours.

403
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:38,891
Really?

404
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:41,018
So I couldn't find the clothes. I'm sorry.

405
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:43,395
That's okay.

406
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:44,980
If you want me to keep looking...

407
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,983
No, you've done more than enough, truly.

408
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:58,994
Bree, Rex just called. He won't be able to meet you here today.

409
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:01,997
Apparently, there was an emergency at the hospital.

410
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:05,417
Oh. Well, I wish he had called me.

411
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:08,420
He suggested perhaps you'd like to meet with me by yourself.

412
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:12,591
You've been very quiet in our joint sessions.

413
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:15,886
What?

414
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:19,890
Oh -- oh, no, thank you. I-I have some things that I-I need to do today.

415
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,600
You -- you sure?

416
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,603
Uh, yeah. I'm sure.

417
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:37,282
Dr. Goldfine, there is something you can do for me.

418
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:39,201
What's that?

419
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:42,204
Take off your coat.

420
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:46,792
So now you're taking Julie on the dinner date with Mike?

421
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:49,920
Yeah, well, if Edie's going to be there, I'm going to need emotional support.

422
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,214
I can't believe she wormed her way in.

423
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:54,216
- How did you let her do that?
- I don't know.

424
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:57,010
I was going to take her out at the knees, but it all happened so fast.

425
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,303
Well, you know what you need to do.

426
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:02,307
You need to get there early, spend a little time with Mike before the little barracuda gets there.

427
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,309
That's a good idea.

428
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:07,896
Edie will get there at 5:45, which means her breasts will arrive at 5:30,

429
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:09,106
so I should shoot for 5:00.

430
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:10,607
That a girl.

431
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:12,609
I'm just going to take these upstairs.

432
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:15,612
I'm going to keep my one little bag and go home.

433
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:22,494
That is a beautiful rose. Where did you get it?

434
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:25,497
Oh, John gave it to me.

435
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:28,709
John? Your gardener? He gave you a rose?

436
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:31,295
Yes.

437
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:34,298
I am having some new bushes planted outside,

438
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:37,301
and he gave me that as a color palette.

439
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:46,185
Sure is beautiful, isn't it?

440
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,899
Yes, it is.

441
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:54,902
I'm sure Freud would not approve of this.

442
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:57,196
Oh, who cares what he thinks?

443
00:28:57,196 --> 00:29:00,199
I took psychology in college. We learned all about Freud.

444
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:02,701
A miserable human being.

445
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:03,911
What makes you say that?

446
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:05,204
Well, think about it --

447
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:09,208
he grew up in the late 1800s. There were no appliances back then.

448
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,794
His mother had to do everything by hand,

449
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:16,590
just backbreaking work from sunup to sundown,

450
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,802
not to mention the countless other sacrifices she probably had to make to take care of her family.

451
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:22,679
And what does he do?

452
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,516
He grows up and becomes famous peddling a theory

453
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,017
that the problems of most adults

454
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:30,979
can be traced back to something awful their mother has done.

455
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:33,899
She must have felt so betrayed.

456
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,193
He saw how hard she worked.

457
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:38,904
He saw what she did for him.

458
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:42,908
Did he even ever think to say "thank you"?

459
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:49,289
I doubt it.

460
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:59,508
There you go.

461
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:03,512
Just so you know, many of Freud's theories have been discredited.

462
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,515
Good.

463
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,401
Boys, I am not going to tell you again -- sit. I mean it.

464
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:20,696
I am serious.

465
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:23,699
You boys are going to be in so much trouble if you don't sit back in those seats.

466
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:36,003
For the first time, Lynette could see this was not the innocent play of children.

467
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:40,090
She was being challenged.

468
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:43,218
So she decided it was time to get creative.

469
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,813
Out. Can't behave, you heard me, you cannot ride.

470
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:59,401
You, out.

471
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:10,621
- Where's mom going?
- I don't know.

472
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:21,298
Mommy's a genius.

473
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:24,301
5, 6 -- alright.

474
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:38,690
I will be right back.

475
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,693
Boys?

476
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:51,286
If you're hiding, you've got to stop now, 'cause mommy doesn't think it's funny!

477
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:53,497
Oh, excuse me.

478
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:56,500
I'm sorry. I'm looking for my boys. Three boys with red hair.

479
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,711
- Have you seen them?
- Yeah. I also saw you drive away and leave them.

480
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:02,005
I know. I was just trying to scare them into behaving.

481
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:03,006
Did you see where they went?

482
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:04,883
Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're in my kitchen.

483
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:08,887
Listen, uh, it seems to me that you have some anger management issues.

484
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:14,101
I have four kids under the age of 6. I absolutely have anger management issues.

485
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:16,895
Yeah, well, I think you need to talk to somebody,

486
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:18,814
because abandoning your children is --

487
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:20,607
Hey, I-I didn't abandon them. I came back.

488
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:23,193
I'm just saying it's not normal.

489
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:24,987
Well, my kids aren't normal,

490
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:26,989
and now I don't have time for this, lady, so --

491
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:28,282
boys, get out here!

492
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:31,285
No, I don't think they should go anywhere until you calm down.

493
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:34,913
- Get in the car.
- She's got cookies.

494
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:36,206
Well, bring them. We're leaving.

495
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:38,584
- Oh, no, no. Stay put.
- I don't think so. Aah!

496
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:41,003
- Listen, lady, you and I are going to have a little talk.
- Leave my mommy alone!

497
00:32:41,003 --> 00:32:42,504
Let go of me!

498
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:45,507
What's the matter with you?

499
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:51,513
Run, boys, run!

500
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:57,686
Son of a -- aah!

501
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:58,687
You get back here!

502
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:01,690
Boys, you're going to need to put on your --

503
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:10,199
You come back here right now! Get back or I'm going to call social services!

504
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:33,680
Oh, my god.

505
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:35,390
Carlos, what have you done?

506
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,808
I saw it when I drove by the dealership.

507
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:39,811
I thought, "Gabrielle would look so beautiful in this."

508
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:43,982
Cost me an arm and a leg.

509
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:47,986
It's got GPS navigation, 200-watt stereo system, rear parking --

510
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,281
Oh, my god, it's beautiful.

511
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:54,993
So... did I take your breath away?

512
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:57,996
Absolutely.

513
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:02,084
Is it the best gift you've ever gotten?

514
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:05,587
Gabrielle could see what this gesture had cost Carlos,

515
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:08,799
so she responded the only way she knew how.

516
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,684
She had a feeling the truth would have been lost on her husband anyway.

517
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:20,686
After all,

518
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:25,691
it's the rare man who understands the value of a single perfect rose.

519
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:54,219
Oh, I hope you don't mind. I thought I'd come by early and help you set up.

520
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:57,389
Hey, Susan.

521
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:00,684
Don't worry. Mike and I have got everything under control.

522
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:07,900
Bongo.

523
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,818
I don't know why he barks at you.

524
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:12,779
Well, I wouldn't take it personally. Dogs are very sensitive.

525
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:15,407
What's up, Bongo, huh?

526
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,284
You never know what freaks them out, huh?

527
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:20,287
In the distance, susan thought she heard a bell ring.

528
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,707
Ooh, is it a strange noise, huh? What is it? A weird smell?

529
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:27,586
Round one had started.

530
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:30,797
Look, all I'm saying is that this whole

531
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:33,509
"it takes two to mess up a marriage" theory is bull.

532
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:35,511
The problems that weave are because of her.

533
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,012
That is not true, Rex.

534
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:41,016
All right, fine. What have I been doing for the past 20 years that's been so awful?

535
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:44,895
You're not saying anything because I've been a great husband,

536
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,814
and it kills you to admit that.

537
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:49,107
Rex, I'm curious --

538
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:54,112
do you ever acknowledge the benefits of living with Bree?

539
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:56,615
Huh?

540
00:35:56,615 --> 00:35:59,618
By your own admission, your home is always clean,

541
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:03,705
your clothes are always freshly pressed. Sounds like a wonderful cook.

542
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:08,710
Despite her flaws, do you ever remember to say "thank you"?

543
00:36:11,213 --> 00:36:12,714
"Thank you"?

544
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:14,383
Yes.

545
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,015
Bongo! Bongo.Get down. Down.

546
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:23,600
Go on. Unh-unh. Down.

547
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,019
I'm sorry.

548
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:28,981
So, um, who's the guy that lives across from mrs. Huber again?

549
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:30,315
Mm. That's mr. Mullen,

550
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:33,318
and just so you know, if he invites you in, you have to meet all of his pets.

551
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:34,695
That's okay. I love animals.

552
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:37,698
He's a taxidermist.

553
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,493
Thanks for the warning.

554
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:45,080
Isn't mr. Mullen's brother your divorce attorney?

555
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,792
Uh, yes. Yes, he was.

556
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,794
Can I say something?

557
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:54,798
In my heart, I still believe that you and Carl are going to get back together.

558
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,384
Really?

559
00:36:57,384 --> 00:37:00,387
Oh, yeah, I-I've never seen two people more in love.

560
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:03,682
I mean, she's never going to find that kind of chemistry with another man. Never.

561
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:07,895
It was everything susan could do to keep a smile on her face.

562
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:11,607
Round two was under way, and she was already taking a beating.

563
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:14,693
- You know what, mrs. Britt?
- What edie hadn't counted on...

564
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:17,696
- Do you know who I always liked?
- Was Susan had someone else in her corner.

565
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:21,200
Mr. Authwell -- your fourth husband.

566
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,203
Oh, he was my second husband. I've only been married twice.

567
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,996
Twice?

568
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:28,999
You weren't married to the guy with all the tattoos that they took away in handcuffs?

569
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:32,419
No, Julie, she wasn't married to Javier.

570
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:35,589
That was just one of her special friends.

571
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:40,010
I think we should change the subject. You know, unless you want to keep talking about it.

572
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,890
Bongo, get down.

573
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,391
Wait, wait. Let -- let me show you something. Bongo.

574
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:48,393
He loves that gravy.

575
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:50,395
While you were in there tossing the salad,

576
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:51,897
I taught him something.

577
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:54,483
Up.

578
00:37:54,483 --> 00:37:59,488
Susan was furious with Edie for using a dog to ingratiate herself with its owner.

579
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:04,117
She was also furious with Mike for not seeing through this blatant maneuver.

580
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:05,911
But mostly...

581
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:08,413
you know what? I'm going to go get the desserts.

582
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:12,417
She was furious with herself for not having thought of it first.

583
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:15,587
I can barely get him to sit.

584
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:18,590
You are a good dog. You're the best dog ever. Yes, you are.

585
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:22,094
Ha ha. I've never seen him walk on two legs.

586
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:25,097
Well, he knows who to come to, doesn't he? He knows who to come to.

587
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:33,814
Here's your dessert.

588
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:36,817
Thank you. Mmm. My, this looks yummy.

589
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:42,698
Oh, look at that.

590
00:38:42,698 --> 00:38:45,701
Looks like Bongo's finally warming up to Susan.

591
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:49,204
Yeah, we just got off on the wrong foot. We're best buddies now.

592
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:55,919
Oh, what a good boy.

593
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:58,589
Bongo, are you okay?

594
00:38:58,589 --> 00:38:59,590
What's wrong with him?

595
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,593
I don't know. I've never heard him make that sound.

596
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:05,220
Hey, you okay, pal?

597
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,182
Mom.

598
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:09,892
Hey, you all right? You okay? Come on.

599
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,901
Call the vet. The number's on the fridge. Tell him I'll be right there.

600
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:22,779
Okay, don't you worry about a thing. I'll stay here and get everything cleaned up.

601
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:25,782
Thanks, Edie.

602
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:28,911
Is there anything I can do?

603
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:31,413
No.

604
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:59,399
- Hey.
- Hey.

605
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:00,984
How's Bongo doing?

606
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:03,487
I'm, uh, just waiting to see if they'll have to operate.

607
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:06,490
Oh, god.

608
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,580
I-I... I stopped and I got this...

609
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:16,500
I am just so sorry for this.

610
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,794
I'm really sorry I snapped at you. I was ju so --

611
00:40:18,794 --> 00:40:20,879
Oh, no, it's okay.

612
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:22,506
Good news.

613
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:24,091
We won't have to do surgery.

614
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:26,385
Oh, that's great.

615
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:29,012
We've given Bongo something to help pass the earring.

616
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:32,015
When he does, would you like us to retrieve it for you?

617
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:34,393
I'm going to say no.

618
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:37,396
Okay. You should be able to take him home in about an hour.

619
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:42,901
You must be so relieved.

620
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:47,114
I'm sorry. I was just really worried.

621
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:49,408
Well, it was your dog. I get it.

622
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:52,411
Actually, he was my wife's dog, and, uh...

623
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:56,206
one of the last things she said to me in the hospital before she died

624
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:58,292
was to be sure I looked after him,

625
00:40:58,292 --> 00:41:01,003
and, um, I promised her I would.

626
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:07,009
And just like that,Susan could suddenly see something she'd never seen before.

627
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:10,304
He, uh, meant so much to her.

628
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:13,307
Mike Delfino was still in love with his late wife.

629
00:41:15,017 --> 00:41:18,020
And if, uh, something had happened, I would have felt like I had failed her.

630
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:21,982
I know that sounds stupid, but I...

631
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:27,988
and she knew right then neither she nor Edie would be laying claim to his heart anytime soon.

632
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:30,407
No, it doesn't. Not at all.

633
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:33,410
So she decided, for now,

634
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,205
she could settle for just being his friend.

635
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:38,790
This is for you. Well, for Bongo.

636
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,501
You give it to him.

637
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:57,809
Yes. As I look back at the world I left behind,

638
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:01,188
it's all so clear to me:

639
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:04,399
the beauty that waits to be unveiled,

640
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:07,486
the mysteries that long to be uncovered.

641
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:14,117
But people so rarely stop to take a look,

642
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,413
they just keep moving.

643
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:24,795
It's a shame really,

644
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:27,798
there's so much to see.

645
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:34,304
