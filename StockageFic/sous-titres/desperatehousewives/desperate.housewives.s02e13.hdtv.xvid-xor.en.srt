all in the name of love

13
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,950
If there is one thing Eddie Brit understood,it was nature of war

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,740
after two fail marriages and countless rocky  romances

15
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,770
She had learned love was a  battle field

16
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:50,880
it is the easiest way to survive the carnage was total surrender

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,420
i was thinking a vacation of roma will be so romantic

18
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,390

but the day comes for every assaulter  when she must take a stand

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,160

25
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,410

26
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,190

27
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,170

28
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,100

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:51,460
You see when it came to man,Eddie had a battle plan of her own

32
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,360

33
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,190

34
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,500

43
00:02:54,490 --> 00:03:01,760
the guest bedroom on the second floor of  Whiteapples' house  had the best view in all misteria lane

44
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,680
from it's windows one could see Mike Delfino's house one down the street

45
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,510
all the way to old huber's place one on the other

46
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,880
but unfortunately for the room's newest guest

47
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,470

48
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,410

00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:56,350
I'm saying god help those who help themselves

184
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,990
hey,i got great news

185
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,860
we just landed the black frozen yorghout  account

186
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,060
really they love the pitch ?

187
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,260
The talking cows rocking their world

188
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,190
how do they like my bull clinton idea

189
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,290
well i rewrote some of  stuff we work on

190
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,580
but you know essentially it'sthe same  and they eat it up

191
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,180
that is fantastic

192
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:26,450
finally we can afford hire another executive

193
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,740
terrific,tell me did they like the promtion plan about a bounch of cow eating  contest

194
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,720
the pitch was running long so we cut off a few things

195
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,510
I'm just glad they love my idea

196
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,840
to be fair

197
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,450
do they like the hugh  play cows

198
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,760
they're calling in for meeting  i gotta go

199
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,290
i love you bye

200
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,510
so this is your spleen

201
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:57,060
normally it would over here because your missing ligament structure

202
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,630
it has wander under over there right  next to the liver

203
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,510
we discuss about this aftermeaning

204
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,170
every one  thinks you should remove it immediately

205
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,840
okay

206
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:14,160
i guess you guys have all sorts of  new exciting  technians  you don't even cut open the body

207
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,680
no not really

208
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,570
no?

209
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:22,840
so we're talking surgery

210
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,660
well i guess i can handle that

211
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,730
people got cut  open everyday

212
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,850
so i assume you will let me do the surgery

213
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,460
you ?

214
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:37,300
it seems natural  i know the most about your case  i promise you will be in very good hands

215
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,610
what?

216
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,530
the first time you see me naked  i will be on an operating table

217
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,880
i promise i will be a perfect gentleman my eyes will be strictly on the spleen

218
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,580
docter mrs baker is here for her follow-up

219
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,290
we need to schedule susan for splenectomy,with me

220
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,410
Oh,congratulations!

221
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,610
So I will call you later?

222
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,380
Oh,I am so happy for him.He's such a doll.

223
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,470
I'm curious. Um...

224
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,740
why were youso congratulatory?

225
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,530
Oh,the spleen surgery--

226
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,910
it'll be his first!

227
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,920
Hey,honey.

228
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,150
Can we talkabout something?

229
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,560
Sure.

230
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,680
So I've been thinkingabout the whole baby thing.

231
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:40,370
And how ever long it takes for you to feel ready,I am fine with.

232
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,110
Okay.

233
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,160
But here's the deal--

234
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,280
I need to knowthat this isn't a maybe.

235
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,630
I want a promisethat we will have children.

236
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,110
I'm sorry.I can't promise that.

237
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,410
Why not?

238
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,520
Because I can't saythat I'm gonna wake up tomorrow

239
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,270
and suddenly wanna do somethingthat I swore my entire life

240
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,560
I would never do. "Maybe" isa very big step for me.

241
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah,well,it isn'tbig enough for me.

242
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,190
Well,I'm sorry,but you'rejust gonna have to accept it.

243
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,580
There's nothing else you can do.

244
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,670
That isn'tnecessarily true.

245
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,180
Excuse me?

246
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,850
Annulments

247
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,150
You are threatening mewith an annulment?

248
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,760
That conniving little bitchput you up to this,didn't she?

249
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,450
Didn't she?

250
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,500
This fight could beover right now
if you'd justmake me a promise.

251
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,930
The only promiseI am making you
is that this isso not over.

252
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,030
hi!

253
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,130
Hey.

254
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,290
Hi.

255
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,690
How's the search coming forthe new ad exec? Any luck?

256
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,200
Oh,the pickings are slim.

257
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,000
So far none ofmy top choices are available.

258
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,010
Hey,um,do you have someonefrom your old company

259
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,180
that you could,you know,maybe recommend?

260
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,170
Daddy!Well--

261
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,410
I can't find my toothbrush.

262
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,970
I'll be upin a second,buddy.

263
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,130
Hi.

264
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,580
As a matter of fact,

265
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,390
there's this one guy who would be perfect.

266
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,260
Yeah?

267
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,620
Yeah,hard-working,smart as a whip. Total package.

268
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,400
Really? What's his name?

269
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,110
Tom.

270
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,670
Tom? Tom what?

271
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,360
Tom scavo.

272
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,920
no! No!

273
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,990
I do not think thatthat is a good idea.

274
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,900
Come on,honey,I mean,the other nightdoing those pitches--

275
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,150
it just gotthe old juices flowing.

276
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,370
I remembered how muchI miss having a real job.

277
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,380
You have a real job,right herestaying home with the kids.

278
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,850
With two incomes,we couldafford a top-notch nanny.

279
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,050
What about penny?

280
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,720
You're the one who fought foroffice day care. Let's use it.

281
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,370
What about the two of us workingand living together?

282
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,860
I think that could bea recipe for disaster.

283
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,820
Why? The last timethat we worked together...

284
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,450
we fell in love.

285
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,650
Oh,it's just...

286
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,370
I'M...

287
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:08,060
I'm not sure that you would findthis job that satisfying.

288
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,390
You don't thinkI'm good enough,do you?

289
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,110
I'm not saying that.

290
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:15,320
Daddy,I stillcan't find my toothbrush!

291
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,340
- I'll go.
- I got it.

292
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,510
Come on,buddy.Let's hunt it down.

293
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,260
So who won the fight?

294
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:23,870
We weren't fighting.

295
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,090
Mommy's just lettingdaddy know where he stands.

296
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,740
Oh,hey! Hey!

297
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,750
- thanks for coming in,mr. Gainey.
- We'll be in touch.

298
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,090
Thank you. Bye.

299
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,110
What did you think?

300
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,570
Well,honestly,I wasn't blown away.

301
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,980
I know the pickingsare slim,

302
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,660
but we can't hold outmuch longer.

303
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,860
We need to hiresomeone this week.

304
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,630
I know! I know! I know.

305
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,010
So who's up next?

306
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,260
Tom cavos.You ever heard of him?

307
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,110
Just... uh...

308
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,700
could you excuse mefor just a minute?

309
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,850
Sure.

310
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,480
- Tom cavos?
- Yeah,it's an anagram.

311
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,080
It's deceptively simple,don't you think?

312
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,480
What do you think
you're doing?

313
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,980
I'm going overyour head.

314
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,160
I mean,you mightnot think I'm good enough,

315
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,100
but maybe ed will bea little more open-minded,

316
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,630
since,you know,he's notconstantly competing with me.

317
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,120
You want the truth,tom?

318
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:21,180
I think you're good.You have moments of brilliance.

319
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,900
But I also thinksometimes you coast.

320
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,550
And I thinkif i were your boss

321
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,350
and had to ride your assevery day,

322
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,750
you would come homeseething with resentment.

323
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,900
Come on! It's hard enoughkeeping a marriage together.

324
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,250
If you're at all concernedabout saving our marriage,

325
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,300
you better let metake my shot.

326
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,160
What does that mean?

327
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,660
It means that a little partof me has been hating you

328
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,650
ever since you tankedmy promotion at petersen.

329
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,230
Tom...

330
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:50,430
but I could let it all go ifyou'll give me this one thing.

331
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,000
Excuse me.Ed's waiting for you guys.

332
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,410
Great! Great!

333
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,180
Just let my résuméspeak for itself.

334
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,840
Uh,just let your résuméspeak for itself?

335
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,800
Yes.

336
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,580
okay!

337
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,410
Oh! You workedthe poncer cheese accounts?

338
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,640
Those "angry mouse" spots?They were hilarious!

339
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,340
I was on thatfrom the beginning.

340
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,190
warning,do not eat the cheese!

341
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,020
The cheese is evil!

342
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,160
I love that!

343
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,280
You've got a great résum?Thank you.

344
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,840
Yeah,gosh,it is.It's quite impressive.

345
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,660
Oh,wow,I see you workedfor bellfore and barrasso.

346
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,490
That's a great shop.

347
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,020
Yeah,I put my time in.

348
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,360
Uh-huh,and when were you there?

349
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,970
Because you forgot to list your dates of employmentfor that one.

350
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,390
Um,that wasa few years back.

351
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,630
Uh-huh. And how longdid you stay?

352
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,010
Just about five months,actually.

353
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,110
What,did you getrecruited by another firm?

354
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,940
Did somebodycherry-pick ya?

355
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,000
No,I was fired.

356
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,300
Yeah,but honestly,I was happy to leave

357
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,720
because they didn't getmy sense of humor.

358
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,000
I actually pitched a version of the "cheese is evil"there first.

359
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,190
They hated it.

360
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,190
Idiots!Well,their loss,right?

361
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,930
Yep.And I see you won a clio for the thompson's salad dressing spot.

362
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,020
That was very cool.

363
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,740
So did you do that solo?

364
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,360
Actually,no. My wifehelped me on that one.

365
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,320
Um,she's inadvertising,too.

366
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,320
But if you were to ask her,

367
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,950
I'm sure she'd tell you she did the whole thing all by herself.

368
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,290
credit hog,huh?I know the type.

369
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,190
You know what,tom?I like you.

370
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,240
Ed...

371
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,330
and I'm not usually onefor hiring in the room.

372
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,160
No,no,no,no,we never hire in the room.

373
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,910
But we're in a time crunch,and we need someone now.

374
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,900
I think you're the guy.

375
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,160
Lynette,you got any issues?

376
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,570
Well...

377
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,540
um,let me just call ina few references

378
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,290
before we makeanything official.

379
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,160
Sure! Sure!We'll be in touch,okay?

380
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,980
the cheese is evil!

381
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,690
Oh,god,I love that.

382
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,880
Oh,um,I'm lookingfor father crowley.

383
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,810
Do you know where he is?

384
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,920
Um,he's inthe confessional.

385
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,070
How long has it beensince your last confession?

386
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,630
Who cares?

387
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,470
Father,it's me.

388
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,380
Gabrielle?

389
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,440
Yeah.

390
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,880
Look,I need youto do something for me.

391
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,840
I need you to get rid ofsister mary bernard.

392
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,520
What? Why?

393
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,450
Because she's ruiningmy marriage.

394
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,320
- Sister mary?
- Yes!

395
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,830
At first it startedwith the love letters while he was in prison,

396
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,740
and the next thing I know,

397
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,940
they're spendingday and night together--

398
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,740
sneaking offto private bible study,

399
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,200
- and one-on-onespiritual consultation.
- Gabrielle--

400
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,750
and if that wasn't enough,he issaying her name in his sleep.

401
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,530
"hold me,sister mary,hold me."

402
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,530
it's disgusting.He's like a lovesick puppy.

403
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,610
do you have reasonto believe that your husbandand sister mary are...

404
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,340
having sex?

405
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,260
Speak from the heart,gabrielle.

406
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,030
This is just betweenme,you and god.

407
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:12,060
Yeah... yep.They're having sex.

408
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,640
Carlos confessedeverything...

409
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,060
right beforehe asked for an annulment.

410
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,820
forgive me,father,for I have sinned.

411
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,420
How long sinceyour last confession?

412
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,370
Mm,not that long ago.

413
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,270
Look,I sorta told a fib,so...

414
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,000
how many "hail marys"is that gonna set me back?

415
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,170
- oh,honey.
- Go away!

416
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,220
Oh,honey,what happenedwasn't my fault.

417
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,870
There's no way I could'vepredicted how betty would react.

418
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,910
Oh,please,you knewsomething bad would happen.

419
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,560
You wanted all thisto blow up in my face.

420
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:20,050
Oh,honey,why would I want that?

421
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,880
Because you're jealous thatmy life's just getting started

422
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,900
and yours is over.

423
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,390
Danielle,that's ridiculous,sweetheart.

424
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,610
Daddy's dead.

425
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,800
You drove your boyfriendto suicide.

426
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,160
You're getting olderby the minute,

427
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,430
and soon you'll beso dried up and bitter

428
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,960
that no man will ever wantto touch you ever again.

429
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,820
Danielle...

430
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,350
and now you're determinedto ruin my life

431
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,630
so I have to stay with you hereand keep you company

432
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,660
while you turninto an old fossil.

433
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:51,160
All I ever wanted wasfor you to be happy.

434
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,510
Don't just want it.Make it happen.

435
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,230
danielle,I don't feel muchlike cooking tonight.

436
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,790
I'm thinkingof ordering a pizza.

437
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,090
I want canadian bacon.

438
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,520
Please.

439
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,390
All right.

440
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,220
He's mad at you'cause you hit him.

441
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,050
Well,I feel bad about that.

442
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,280
But when I considerthe risks he was taking...

443
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,040
it's a shamehe can't see that girl.

444
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,990
She's so pretty.

445
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,110
What did you sayabout danielle?

446
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,640
I said that she...

447
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,680
you know I don't want youthinking about things like that.

448
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,510
I'm sorry.I didn'T. I'm sorry.

449
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,910
It's okay. It's okay.

450
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,290
Go on and run upto your room.

451
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,510
Read the comics I got you.

452
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,400
And,caleb?

453
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,930
If I ever catch you lookingat that van de kamp girl,

454
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:18,100
I'll hit you twice as hardas I hit your brother,

455
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,550
and I won't feel bad about it.

456
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:21,750
Okay?

457
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,790
Okay.

458
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,520
So this wholesplenectomy thing--

459
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,140
you feelgood about it,huh?

460
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,490
Yeah,yeah,I told you.It's a routine surgery.

461
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,930
You're gonna be fine.

462
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,010
Right,right.

463
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,890
Actually,I sort of meant,um...

464
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,080
do you personallyfeel confident?

465
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,390
What do you mean?

466
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,910
Well,you know,you're gonna be...

467
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,260
hacking into me,

468
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:08,140
and I just wanted to make surethat you feel ready.

469
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,250
I've never taken outa spleen before.

470
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,280
But believe me,it's no big deal.

471
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,010
Spleen,gallbladder--it's all the same.

472
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,240
Okay,red flag! See,I didn'tgo to medical school,

473
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,330
but I'm thinking--not all the same.

474
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,170
Susan,I know what I'm doing.You're gonna have to trust me.

475
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,560
I would like to.But I gotta be honest--

476
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,720
the fact that you can't evencut that steak isn't helping.

477
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,010
That's not fair.You overcooked it,

478
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,960
and,frankly,it's not the freshest meat.

479
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,160
Well,neither am I.I've got 35 years on that cow.

480
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:36,330
Wait,susan,are you saying you don't want meto be your surgeon?

481
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,430
I'm sorry.

482
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:44,700
I don't mean this to soundthe wrong way. I just...

483
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,430
I would be more comfortablewith an experienced surgeon.

484
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,410
That's okay. I understand.

485
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,980
Thank you.

486
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,290
I should really be going.

487
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,470
What?

488
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,820
I didn't evenserve dessert yet.

489
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,180
You said you understood!

490
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,640
No,I do,I do.I respect your decision to see another doctor,

491
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,060
but you know what?

492
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,760
You need to respectthat my feelings are hurt.

493
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,860
What? You want me to putmy life on the line to service your ego?

494
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,220
I save lives every day.I cut. I save. I cut. I save.

495
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,340
That's what I do,and if that gives me an out-of-control ego,

496
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,560
well,maybe I need that to cut intoanother human being.

497
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,100
jim...

498
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,790
hey.Hey.

499
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,330
Dinner's ready.

500
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,080
So did you call around?Check on my references?

501
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,070
I told edyou were my husband,

502
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,520
and he was cool with that.

503
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,290
He really wants to hire you.

504
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,600
So who am ito stand in the way?

505
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:54,400
Really? So I got the job?

506
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,830
On one condition.

507
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,600
If you take this job,

508
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,820
you are never allowedto bring up

509
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,730
what happened beforewith your promotion.

510
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:07,860
That's it? Deal.

511
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,560
No,it's not a deal.I need a solemn vow

512
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,230
that you will never throwthat in my face ever again.

513
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,850
Because if you do,you will unleash demons

514
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,050
that you do not wanna meet.

515
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,930
I get it.

516
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,500
And what i really need from you...

517
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,630
is to be forgiven.

518
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,270
Actually,I already haD.

519
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,390
This dinner is really good.

520
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,690
Thank you.

521
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,150
Thank you.

522
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,020
- Hi,betty.
- Hello.

523
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,600
I wanted to talk to youabout what happened the other day with the kids.

524
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,650
I told you,we will be moving soon.

525
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,840
There's nothingto worry about.

526
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,160
Well,my fear is thatif we keep them apart,

527
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,270
they'll try that much harderto be together.

528
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,600
I mean,you knowhow teenagers can be,and,

529
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:37,330
well,a lot can happenin a couple of weeks.

530
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,960
I'll make a deal with you.

531
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,690
If you control yours,I will control mine.

532
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,130
Well,how about someold-fashioned chaperoning?

533
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,800
That way they can,um,still see each other,

534
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,760
and we won't have tobe the villains.

535
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,060
When it comesto my son's best interests,

536
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,590
I'm not afraid of beingthe villain.

537
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:59,000
I assumed that you wouldfeel the same way,bree.

538
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,620
Now that you mention it,I guess I do.

539
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,600
I have to go. I have some,um,muffins in the oven.

540
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,590
Mom,what's wrong?

541
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,670
It's the applewhites. I don't want you to go near them.

542
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,580
What?!

543
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,440
Do you remember the manthey arrested--

544
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,170
the one that brokeinto gabrielle's

545
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,470
and escapedfrom the mental hospital?

546
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,500
He's there.

547
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,110
I saw him in their window.They're hiding him.

548
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,410
You're kidding.No,I'm not.

549
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,240
And I forbid youto go over there.

550
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:46,330
Lynette,hi,it's bree.Uh,listen,

551
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,420
call me when youget this message,

552
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,800
and please cometo poker tonight.

553
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,030
I have some big newsabout the applewhites.

554
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,360
All right,bye.

555
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,620
Who was that?

556
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,270
Sister mary.

557
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,940
They just transferred her toa parish in fairbanks,alaska.

558
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,850
You're kidding me. Why?

559
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,460
She doesn't know.

560
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,090
The diocese wouldn't evengive her a reason.

561
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,970
Ah,vatican politics.

562
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,350
What's wrong?

563
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,210
I think I'm just coming downwith a migraine.

564
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,990
Oh,well,maybe youshould go lie down.

565
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,170
I'm gonna be outfor a while.

566
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,060
All right.

567
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,330
Uh,I'll see you there.

568
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,970
Susan?What are you doing here?

569
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,290
We need to talk.

570
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,050
Okay,all right,but,look,I just got out of surgery.

571
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,870
I've been waitingfor three hours.

572
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,450
After you stormed outthe other night,

573
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,040
I started to doubt myself.

574
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,850
I started to think,

575
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,170
"gee,you know,maybe I shouldjust ignore my better instincts,

576
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,650
and I should let dr. Ron gut me like a fish."

577
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,650
- Susan--
- I mean,why not?

578
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,690
'Cause all my life,

579
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,360
I have jumped through hoopsto keep men from leaving.

580
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,500
But I'm not doing it anymore.So tough luck,pally.

581
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,830
You just missed outon a good thing.

582
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,110
Susan...

583
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,230
you've been herefor three hours?

584
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,710
Yeah.Well,two hours ago,

585
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:16,760
flowers,champagneand an apology note were deliveredto your doorstep.

586
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,100
Really?

587
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,440
Look,I put our relationshipat risk,all right?

588
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,170
And it was stupid.

589
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:28,530
I haven't felt this wayabout somebody in a long time.

590
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,170
Susan,I really like you.

591
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,310
And because of that,I...

592
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,750
I can't be your doctor,let alone,your surgeon.

593
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,170
I mean,there's a pretty good reason why they make those rules.

594
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,220
Listen,I hopeyou forgive me,all right?

595
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,170
Because I'll hate myselfif I lose you.

596
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,570
I wouldn't want youto hate yourself.

597
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,430
No.

598
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,180
And I am so sorryabout that... snap thing.

599
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,470
I was just tryingto be theatrical.

600
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,770
I got your note.What's going on?

601
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,510
Are you hidingsomeone in your house?

602
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,660
What?

603
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,960
My mom saw someone inyour second-story window.

604
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,830
She thinks it's the guywho broke into mrs. Solis'.

605
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,950
Damn it,caleb.

606
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,450
Is that his name?

607
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,940
Has she told anybody else?

608
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,930
She left messageson her friends' machines.

609
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,860
They're coming oversoon to get details.

610
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,050
We're gonna have to leave tonight.

611
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,700
- This is--
- why? What's going on?

612
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:38,770
I would loveto tell you,believe me,I would.

613
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,710
But I can'T.

614
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,550
If you trust me,I could help you.

615
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,800
My familyhas secrets,too.

616
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,520
What my brother did--

617
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,780
it's bad.

618
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,990
Last year my brotherdid something really awful,

619
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,180
and my parentscovered it up for him.

620
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,000
If anyone were toever find out,

621
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,640
andrew and my momcould go to jail.

622
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,640
So you don't have to worryabout me judging you.

623
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,640
Tell me your secrets.I'll understand.

624
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,800
Okay.

625
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,910
But you tell meyours first.

626
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,460
What are you doing here?

627
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:36,450
I heard you werebeing transferred so I cameto say good-bye.

628
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,680
Come to gloatis more like it.

629
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,260
No,we've hadour differences,

630
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:45,350
but that doesn't meanI'm happy to see you shipped off to alaska.

631
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,860
Brr.

632
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,950
You had something to dowith this,didn't you?

633
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,050
Me? Oh,I'm justa humble sinner.

634
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,580
You're the one withall the power around here--

635
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,160
all the... annulment mojo.

636
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,450
Is that why you did it?

637
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,700
Well,getting rid of meisn't gonna change anything.

638
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,190
Carlos will do what he wants.

639
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,820
The problems in your marriagearen't going away.

640
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,310
Maybe not...

641
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,670
but you certainly are.

642
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,500
You missed a spot.

643
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,590
That was a mistake.

644
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,360
There.I think we're all done here.

645
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,190
Oh,my god!Oh,my god! Hold on!

646
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,890
Are you okay?

647
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,780
Stop fighting!

648
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:33,500
Stop fighting! No!

649
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,990
What the hellwere you thinking?

650
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:40,460
Uh,depends.What have you heard?

651
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,250
I got a callfrom the church.

652
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,930
They said you attackedsister mary.

653
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,870
Yeah,that's about right.

654
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,040
What are you thinking?

655
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,800
I wasn't,but I was thinkingabout it on the way over here.

656
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,700
And I realized the assI should be kicking is yours.

657
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,880
- Mine?
- Yes!

658
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,530
Sister mary manipulated youinto threatening me,

659
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,970
but you're the idiotthat fell for it.

660
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,870
I was notthreatening you.

661
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,250
I was asking for a promise.

662
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,080
You made me a promise,carlos,

663
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,520
a long time ago--till death do us part.

664
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:12,710
And one day you just come homeand start throwing words around like annulment.

665
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,440
How do you thinkthat makes me feel?

666
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,730
Okay,I'm sorryabout that.

667
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,520
I need to have a child.

668
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,360
And I need to knowI'm the woman you want to spendthe rest of your life with,

669
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,220
not just some uterusin high heels.

670
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,020
Gabrielle,please--

671
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,600
no,carlos,I am sorry.

672
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,850
I am not gonna be blackmailedinto giving birth.

673
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,770
You have to choose.

674
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,360
And I wish you would do itso I can move on with my life.

675
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,610
Well,of course I choose you.

676
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,750
I think that'sthe right decision.

677
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,600
You know,I made a decision,too.

678
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,490
The answer to your questionearlier is yes.

679
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,300
Yes...

680
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,310
I wanna have a baby.

681
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,510
I wanna havea baby with you.

682
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,150
betty.

683
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,700
What a surprise.

684
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,980
Can I talk to youfor a moment?

685
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,910
Uh,now is actuallynot a good time for me.

686
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,290
I think it is.

687
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:10,400
I wanted to chat with you before you didsomething foolish.

688
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,510
I don't knowwhat you mean.

689
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,400
The person you sawat my house today

690
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,210
is my other son.

691
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,090
His name is caleb.

692
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,690
He didn't harm gabrielle,

693
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,630
and he didn't hurtthe man in the car trunk.

694
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,340
That's all you need to know.

695
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,990
He's your son?

696
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,690
He's my dear sonwho happens to be slow.

697
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,710
Sometimes he makes mistakes.

698
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,880
But,betty,the policeare looking for him.

699
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:45,500
He escaped from that facilitythey sent him to.

700
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,170
He had help,trust me.

701
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,790
I've always thoughtthe maternal instinct

702
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,230
is one ofnature's most amazing gifts.

703
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:58,990
I mean,the length thatsome mothers will go to to protect their children--

704
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:03,200
it drives ordinary womento do extraordinary things,

705
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,210
women like me,bree,and like you.

706
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,160
What are you talking about?

707
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,290
If you breathe one wordof caleb's existence to anyone,

708
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:16,550
I will tell carlos,gabrielle and the police

709
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,470
that it was your sondriving the car

710
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,090
that killed juanita solis

711
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,760
and that you have been coveringup his crime ever since.

712
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,130
We're going to begreat friends,bree.

713
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,670
We have so much in common.

714
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,830
So is that all she said?

715
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,620
Yeah,something aboutthe applewhites.

716
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,320
I'm dying of curiosity.

717
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,020
it's rude to keeppeople waiting.

718
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,460
Hi. Come on in.

719
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:55,130
So,spill it.

720
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,790
What's the scoopon the applewhites?

721
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,390
Um,about that... um...

722
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,460
oh,bree,come on,dish already!

723
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,460
Well,perhaps I gotmore excited than I should have,

724
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:08,310
but I recently found outthat betty applewhite

725
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,000
is quite the poker player,

726
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:15,460
and so,uh,I have invited herto join our weekly game.

727
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,770
Hello,everybody.

728
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:22,410
I hope you broughtyour checkbooks because I am feeling lucky.

729
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:31,780
Everyone understands the nature of war.

730
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,250
I raise.

731
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,740
We also understand that victory depends on the cards

732
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,500
that we have been dealt.

733
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,090
Some,when faced with a bloody battle,

734
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,210
simply give in.

735
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,730
But for some,surrender is unacceptable.

736
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,840
Well,bree,what are you gonna do?

737
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:56,020
Even though they know it will be a fight...

738
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,210
I'll raise you.

739
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,480
...To the death.
