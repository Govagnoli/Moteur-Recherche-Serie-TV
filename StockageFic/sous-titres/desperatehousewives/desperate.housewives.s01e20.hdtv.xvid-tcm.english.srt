I told you not to speak to him anymore.

25
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:41,800
I'm not.
That's why he's throwing gravel at my window.

26
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:49,500
That's it. I'm going to 
heal him of this once and for all.

Ow! Ow!

29
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:04,200
Mrs Mayer, I'm so sorry.
It's just--

30
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:06,900
One pebble wasn't working,
so I tried a whole handful.

31
00:02:06,935 --> 00:02:08,200
Look, I'll make it up to you.

32
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:11,400
How, you're gonna give me your corneas?
- Mom, lay back.

33

Come on, Julie.
I just want to see you again.

00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:24,600
You know, talk, hang out.

37
00:02:24,635 --> 00:02:27,800
Maybe it would be better
if we cooled it for a while, OK?

38
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:28,900
Why?

39
00:02:28,935 --> 00:02:42,500
You just threw rocks in her mother's face,
how's that for a start?

40
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:43,900
Thank you so much.

41
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:46,400
I've been trying to find a way
to break up with him for weeks.

42

George--

59
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:22,600
So, how's your health?

60
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:25,300
Not good. And my cardiologist is an idiot.

61
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:28,800
The doctor upped his dosage twice
and it's still not helping.

62
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,800
I'm sure it'll all work itself out.

63
00:04:30,835 --> 00:04:33,000
It's funny running into you both.

64
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:36,800
I happen to have a bonsai exhibition in
Mt Pleasant Friday night. Would you like to go?

I would love to! Rex?

66
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:43,500
A whole evening with bonsai trees?
Wouldn't it be easier to shoot me?

67
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:46,300
Probably.

68
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,400
Why don't we just go by ourselves then?

69
00:04:56,435 --> 00:05:00,000
Actually-- Bree, we have that thing Friday night.

70
00:05:00,035 --> 00:05:01,300
What thing?
We don't have a thing.

71
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:06,300
I think your husband is trying to say that
he doesn't want you to go out with me.

72
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:09,100
Rex, are you jealous?

73
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:10,000
No.

74
00:05:10,035 --> 00:05:14,100
It's true that we dated during the separation,
but George and I are just friends now, aren't we?

75
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:16,100
It's certainly platonic.

76
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:17,100
But if you feel threatened--

77
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:22,200
I don't feel threatened.

78
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:26,500
Good! Then it's a date.

79
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,300
So are you going to make a purchase today?

80
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:32,000
You know, I have finally convinced Rex
to buy his first orchid.

81
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:33,100
Make sure you study up.

82
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:37,000
I hate people who own precious flowers
and don't know how to take proper care of them.

83
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:38,600
You know what I hate?
Weeds.

84
00:05:38,635 --> 00:05:42,300
They pop up out of nowhere
and you have to work so hard to get rid of them.

85
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:46,400
I've found, with the right chemicals
you can get rid of almost anything.

86
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:49,237
See you Friday.
- Bye.

87
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:58,400
Mrs Solís! What a surprise.
We haven't seen you here in quite some time.

88
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:03,200
Yes, my husband and I went through
a downsizing phase. But we stepped out of it.

89
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:05,700
Life is good.

90
00:06:05,735 --> 00:06:07,800
Oh, and this would make it so much better.

91
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:11,794
Excellent.
Slip inside, see how that feels.

92
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:17,900
I'd love to have this in my driveway by Saturday.

93
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:20,900
I'm having the big barbecue.
I want everyone to see it.

94
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:23,100
Exciting. What's the occasion?

95
00:06:23,135 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm throwing my husband a going-away party.

96
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:26,900
Really? Where's he going?

97
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:31,100
It's, um -- a sort of
government-sponsored sabbatical.

98
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:34,700
How long will he be gone?
- Eight months.

99
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:37,235
Six, with good behavior.

100
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:41,200
Isn't the leather interior wonderful?

101
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,900
It is.
It just smells a little intense.

102
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:50,803
Because it was imported from Italy.
It's 100% Italian calf.

103
00:06:56,935 --> 00:07:00,800
I'm so sorry.
It hit me out of nowhere.

104
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:05,100
It was so weird.
Smells are making me nauseous lately.

105
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:08,000
Boobs tender? Achey back?

106
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:10,200
Yeah! Has it been going around?

107
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:12,200
Only for centuries.

108
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:14,700
I went through it all
when I was carrying my oldest.

109
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:19,600
The truth is, you'll never fit a child seat
in the back of that tiny Spider anyway.

110
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:21,900
The 4-doors are much roomier.

111
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:26,400
Wha-- I-I'm sorry,
you think I'm pregnant?

112
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:28,300
No, I'm not pregnant!

113
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:31,200
Oh. You have those symptoms,
I just assumed.

114
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:34,100
You assumed wrong.
- I'm sorry.

115
00:07:34,135 --> 00:07:36,700
I'm on the pill, for God's sakes.
- OK.

116
00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:38,600
And I don't want a 4-door.

117
00:07:38,635 --> 00:07:42,300
I want a sexy low convertible,
and I want to buy one. Right now.

118
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,400
I'll go start the paperwork.

119
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:46,500
Not this one, I-- vomited in this one.

120
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:47,600
Right.

121
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:50,330
We'll find you a fresh one.

122
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:02,500
Lynette!

123
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:04,200
You forgot your Halperin file.

124
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:07,100
Oh my God. Lynette.

125
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:11,108
<i>If there was one person Lynette

00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:18,600

had begged Tom to marry her.

128
00:08:18,635 --> 00:08:22,800
<i>But he told her 
he wasn't the marrying kind.

129
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:27,300
<i>Then one day, Tom happened to meet
a rising young executive

130
00:08:27,335 --> 00:08:32,600
<i>by the name of Lynette Lindkvist.

131
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:42,100
<i>And after a few torrid weeks, Tom decided
perhaps he </i>was<i> the marrying kind after all,

132
00:08:42,135 --> 00:08:46,600

to move back to Chicago.

00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:51,052
<i>Permanently.
Or so Lynette had hoped.

134
00:08:51,335 --> 00:08:55,500
You look fantastic!
- Thank you!

135
00:08:55,535 --> 00:09:01,500
And you, you're-- here! In the office!
Tom's office!

136
00:09:01,535 --> 00:09:04,100
Yeah, going on 3 months now.

137
00:09:04,135 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh.

138
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:08,000
Didn't Tom tell you?

139
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:14,100
It-- must have slipped his mind.

140
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:18,600
Ah, forget to tell your wife
you work with the old girlfriend, huh?

141
00:09:18,635 --> 00:09:24,009
I guess that makes me
your dirty little secret.

142
00:09:25,335 --> 00:09:31,300
Well, I'll-- go back to work.
See you later.

143
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:33,000
Can't wait!

144
00:09:33,035 --> 00:09:37,847
Oh! Almost forgot.
Your file.

145
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:46,200
Hey Paul, what's up?

146
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:49,200
Something's been nagging me, Edie.
I want to talk to you about it.

147
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:50,100
OK?

148
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:53,700
That night I found you in my house--
why were you really there?

149
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:56,600
You know why.
I came by to drop off your key.

150
00:09:56,635 --> 00:10:01,100
Some things were moved around my living room.
What were you looking for?

151
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:03,200
What are you talking about?

152
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:06,100
Do I have to call the police?

153
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:08,800
Do whatever you want.

154
00:10:08,835 --> 00:10:10,896
Suit yourself.

155
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:14,900
OK, OK!

156
00:10:14,935 --> 00:10:16,900
Susan made me do it.

157
00:10:16,935 --> 00:10:19,800
She had this fixation on
why Mary Alice killed herself,

158
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:23,100
and she keeps blathering about
blackmail notes and dead babies.

159
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:26,600
Oh, and she got really hot in the butt
when she found the name "Angela"

160
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:28,432
written on one of your videotapes.

161
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:32,000
Did she find what she was looking for?

162
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:37,200
No. You came home before 
she had a chance to watch the video.

163
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:39,600
I see.

164
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:42,357
She sort of thinks you're evil.

165
00:10:45,335 --> 00:10:47,510
Thank you, Edie.

166
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:55,300
What was that all about?

167
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:59,900
Susan Mayer's obsession with Mary Alice
almost got me arrested.

168
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:02,300
And now Paul's after her.

169
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:07,481
If I liked her better I'd warn her,
but-- you know--

170
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,705
Thanks.

171
00:11:21,735 --> 00:11:23,027
Susan?

172
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:28,850
I'll-- talk to you girls later.

173
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:32,100
Still avoiding me, huh?

174
00:11:32,135 --> 00:11:33,811
No, no.

175
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:37,400
What do you want?

176
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:40,600
I heard you and Edie broke into Paul Young's house.

177
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:42,300
Who told you that?

178
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,500
Edie.

179
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:48,500
Well-- yeah, we did.

180
00:11:48,535 --> 00:11:50,900
We were just looking--

181
00:11:50,935 --> 00:11:52,400
It doesn't matter, it was dumb.

182
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:52,720
Listen, I want you to stay away from that guy.

183
00:11:55,035 --> 00:11:57,900
I was planning to do that anyway.

184
00:11:57,935 --> 00:11:58,863
Good.

185
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:02,200
Mike?

186
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:04,300
I know why I was planning on staying away from him.

187
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:06,300
Why do <i>you</i> want me to stay away from him?

188
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:09,100
I just know he's a bad guy.

189
00:12:09,135 --> 00:12:11,800
So please don't mess with him.

190
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:13,202
I won't.

191
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:18,207
I promise.

192
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:32,000
So-- I've been thinking 
about the pharmacist.

193
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:33,900
George? What about him?

194
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:35,900
I don't think you should go out with him.

195
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:36,900
Please don't be this way.

196
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:41,200
He's the only friend I have who is
interested in cultural things.

197
00:12:41,235 --> 00:12:42,500
Bree--

198
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:45,300
I'm worried because he is obviously
still in love with you.

199
00:12:45,335 --> 00:12:49,300
No, he just wants to be friends.
He told me so.

200
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,200
What else would a man in love say?

201
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:54,100
He's desperate to spend time with you.

202
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:57,400
He does not seem desperate to me.

203
00:12:57,435 --> 00:13:01,400
I saw the way his hands trembled
when you touched his shoulder.

204
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:02,480
They did?

205
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:07,600
When we first started dating,
the same thing happened to me.

206
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:09,700
I don't remember that.

207
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:13,200
Listen, continuing to see him
would just give him false hope.

208
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:17,500
I certainly don't want to hurt him-- again.

209
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:19,800
No. You don't.

210
00:13:19,835 --> 00:13:23,600
I think it would be a good idea
to switch pharmacies.

211
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:25,007
Really?

212
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:33,700
OK.
You know what I'll miss most about him?

213
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:37,000
George always has a way of
making me feel good about myself.

214
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:40,584
Yeah, he's a terrific guy.

215
00:13:41,535 --> 00:13:46,500
Honey, do your hands still tremble
when they touch me?

216
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:51,200
No. But come on,
we've been married 18 years.

217
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:59,401
Yes, we have.
And you still don't know when I need you to lie.

218
00:14:03,835 --> 00:14:05,300
Excuse me.

219
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:08,500
Um-- this home pregnancy test,
is it a good one?

220
00:14:08,535 --> 00:14:11,100
I guess.

221
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:13,000
OK, um-- do you have a rest room?

222
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:15,000
It's for employees only.

223
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh, it's right over there, Mrs Solís.
Help yourself.

224
00:14:19,035 --> 00:14:20,213
Thank you.

225
00:14:23,435 --> 00:14:26,100
What did I tell you about being rude to customers?

226
00:14:26,135 --> 00:14:27,200
You'll stick a smile on your face,

227
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:31,530
or I'll keep you in the back stocking shelves
with no one else to look at you!

228
00:14:33,435 --> 00:14:36,600
Bree! What a pleasant surprise!
What brings you here?

229
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:39,900
Didn't we just fill Dr Van de Kamp's prescription last week?

230
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:41,000
George, as it turns out,

231
00:14:41,035 --> 00:14:43,900
I won't be able to go with you to the bonsai expo.

232
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh, why not?

233
00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:48,500
I think it'd be a mistake for us
to spend too much time together.

234
00:14:48,535 --> 00:14:52,100
Dr Van de Kamp said something about me.
What was it?

235
00:14:52,135 --> 00:14:53,900
It doesn't matter.

236
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,100
Please. Tell me.

237
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:59,900
He said you're still in love with me.

238
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:03,000
That's-- that's stupid.

239
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,500
I'm not in love with you.

240
00:15:05,535 --> 00:15:07,100
I'm not.

241
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:10,800
The truth is,
I'm in love with Ginger.

242
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:12,400
Ginger? The stock girl?

243
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:16,486
Yes. It's very serious.

244
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:23,300
Oh-- why didn't you tell me?

245
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:26,400
We're taking it slow.
But she is definitely the one.

246
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:28,600
Oh my goodness! This changes everything.

247
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:31,900
Listen. A friend of mine is having
a barbecue for her husband on Saturday,

248
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:33,500
and I think you should come.

249
00:15:33,535 --> 00:15:36,100
Really?
- Yes, and bring Ginger.

250
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,300
Ginger? I don't know if she can make it.

251
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:44,000
But you have to bring Ginger, because
if Rex sees you two together, he'll relax.

252
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:46,500
Oh. Uh--

253
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:47,500
OK.

254
00:15:47,535 --> 00:15:50,415
Son of a bitch!

255
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:56,600
You are out of toilet paper.

256
00:15:56,635 --> 00:16:00,595
Bree, I'll call you later!

257
00:16:04,435 --> 00:16:06,414
Lynette?

258
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:11,400
Honey?
Are you home?

259
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:13,700
Three months?

260
00:16:13,735 --> 00:16:17,200
God, you scared the hell out of me!

261
00:16:17,235 --> 00:16:19,900
Were you ever going to tell me?

262
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:23,000
I wanted to, but I kept putting it off.

263
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:24,600
I knew how you'd react.

264
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:28,400
Congratulations, you read me like a book.

265
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:31,400
Why would you hire that woman?

266
00:16:31,435 --> 00:16:34,800
Technically, Peterson found her.
I just vouched for her.

267
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:37,500
Tom!
- Come on honey, I'm just helping her out.

268
00:16:37,535 --> 00:16:38,500
It's the least I can do.

269
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:44,400
She was devastated when I left her for you.
I felt bad.

270
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:47,200
Do you still have feelings for her?

271
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:49,200
All right, I'm not talking to you.

272
00:16:49,235 --> 00:16:53,200
You can tell me you still care about her.
Don't you? Just a teeny tiny little bit?

273
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:57,100
I was just trying to be a good guy.
That's all.

274
00:16:57,135 --> 00:17:00,400
Well you can't work with her.
- What do you want me to do, quit?

275
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:02,800
Talk to Peterson. Maybe you can get a transfer.

276
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:05,700
Weren't you guys planning on
starting something up in Belize?

277
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:08,100
Honey, you're crazy!

278
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:09,600
No, I'm serious.

279
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:12,800
If she stays, I will haunt your office.

280
00:17:12,835 --> 00:17:15,100
I'll bring you lunch every day.

281
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:18,700
I'll bring your kids to visit.
I will change diapers on your desk.

282
00:17:18,735 --> 00:17:22,100
Every birthday cake in the break room,
every retirement party,

283
00:17:22,135 --> 00:17:25,800
I will be there. Watching her.

284
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:31,650
Well, I better get you a parking space.
Cause she's staying.

285
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:45,309
Don't you think it spices up the room?

286
00:17:52,035 --> 00:17:58,956
Oh, I was just letting you a gift.
To apologize for throwing gravel in your face.

287
00:17:59,635 --> 00:18:01,500
You didn't have to do that.

288
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:04,900
I kind of did.
I want us to be friends.

289
00:18:04,935 --> 00:18:09,500
Yeah, well--
that's not going to happen.

290
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,100
Why not?

291
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:14,700
Aside from you blinding me,

292
00:18:14,735 --> 00:18:17,500
several weeks ago 
you freaked out in my house.

293
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:21,700
You screamed,
you threw furniture around--

294
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:27,100
OK. I realize I was at a run that night.
But I was upset.

295
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:30,300
You have to get over that.
For Julie's sake.

296
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:31,300
For Julie's sake?

297
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:32,500
How do you think it makes her feel

298
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:35,200
that her mother and her boyfriend
can't even get along?

299
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:41,100
Zach, Julie does not think of you 
as her boyfriend.

300
00:18:41,135 --> 00:18:45,100
In fact, I don't think 
she wants anything to do with you.

301
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:46,700
She said that?

302
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:47,600
Yeah.

303
00:18:47,635 --> 00:18:48,500
I don't believe you.

304
00:18:48,535 --> 00:18:51,100
Believe whatever you want.

305
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:54,000
If she did, it's because
you told her stuff about me that's not true!

306
00:18:54,035 --> 00:18:57,100
Zach! Come here!

307
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:58,602
Right now!

308
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:08,190
Please. Don't ruin this for me.

309
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,300
How do you know Mary Alice?

310
00:19:32,335 --> 00:19:33,100
Who?

311
00:19:33,135 --> 00:19:37,900
Mary Alice Young.
She lives next door to me in Fairview.

312
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:40,600
She's standing right here in this picture with you.

313
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:44,700
That's Angela Forrest. We worked together
at the rehab center, 15 years ago.

314
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:48,573
Don't be dense, Felicia.
Don't you think I know my own neighbor?

315
00:19:50,935 --> 00:19:53,600
Does this Mary Alice have children?

316
00:19:53,635 --> 00:19:57,578
A teenager. Her boy.

317
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:01,933
What?

318
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:06,984
Angela and I worked together 
with a very disturbed young woman

319
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:09,435
who gave birth to a baby boy.

320
00:20:09,435 --> 00:20:13,500
About a year later,
Angela and her husband

321
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:15,000
disappeared.

322
00:20:15,035 --> 00:20:19,900
Not long after that,
I heard that the child was missing too.

323
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:22,600
People said it was just a coincidence.

324
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:28,600
But in my heart I always hoped
that she had given him a proper home.

325
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:32,900
Are you saying
she stole the baby?

326
00:20:32,935 --> 00:20:38,400
Don't look shocked, Martha.
Makes your face look fat.

327
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:42,500
The biological mother was a drug addict.

328
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:46,100
If Angela really is your neighbor,
which I doubt,

329
00:20:46,135 --> 00:20:50,799
then that child was very lucky.

330
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:12,800
Lynette, hey!

331
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:14,400
If you're looking for Tom,
he's out with a client.

332
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:17,800
No. I actually wanted to see you.

333
00:21:17,835 --> 00:21:20,300
That's really funny.
I was thinking the same thing.

334
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:22,900
I've been here all this time.
We should go out.

335
00:21:22,935 --> 00:21:25,000
For lunch, just the two of us.

336
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:27,800
Yeah, I'll check my book.

337
00:21:27,835 --> 00:21:30,400
So Annabelle--

338
00:21:30,435 --> 00:21:33,500
do you have feelings for Tom?

339
00:21:33,535 --> 00:21:34,700
What?

340
00:21:34,735 --> 00:21:36,100
You heard me.

341
00:21:36,135 --> 00:21:40,400
OK, you want to talk about this, Lynette?
Let's talk.

342
00:21:40,435 --> 00:21:44,500
Yes, Tom and I were in love.
But he married you.

343
00:21:44,535 --> 00:21:48,800
I'm not looking to break up a happy couple.

344
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:52,400
Anyway, that's probably more <i>your</i> speed, isn't it?

345
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:55,800
Morning, ladies.
Just gotten in for a little more fuel.

346
00:21:55,835 --> 00:22:00,300
Yeah, one man's sludge
is another man's liquid gold.

347
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:03,589
Well, back to the trenches.

348
00:22:05,735 --> 00:22:08,300
Watch your step.
Tom and I are a team.

349
00:22:08,335 --> 00:22:12,500
Our marriage is rock solid.
Nothing you do could ever break that up.

350
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:16,712
Then why are you down here right now,
warning me?

351
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:34,400
Gabrielle! What brings you down here?

352
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:38,400
Sweet mother of God,
what have you done this time?

353
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:40,500
You're pregnant?
- Yes.

354
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:43,000
And it's impossible, I'm on the pill!

355
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:45,200
Which I know you probably think is a sin.
But it works.

356
00:22:45,235 --> 00:22:47,900
It's a 99.9% effective sin.

357
00:22:47,935 --> 00:22:51,000
Maybe it's in that 1/10 of a percent
that God resides.

358
00:22:51,035 --> 00:22:53,900
Couldn't wait to throw that in, could you?

359
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:55,200
God is screwing with me.

360
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:58,600
He doesn't like how I live my life,
so he's punishing me.

361
00:22:58,635 --> 00:23:02,565
Have you done something
that would warrant being punished?

362
00:23:03,835 --> 00:23:05,483
The gardener?

363
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:07,800
I thought that was over.

364
00:23:07,835 --> 00:23:11,800
No, it was, and then--
He just happened to be there.

365
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:14,400
That's my point:
I'd be an awful mother.

366
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm selfish, I'm self-centered--
The only person more self-centered than me is Carlos.

367
00:23:19,035 --> 00:23:22,400
He's so self-centered that he doesn't even know
how self-centered I am.

368
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:23,700
We'd be terrible parents.

369
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:27,800
Gabrielle, I'd like to help.
But I'm not sure what it is you want.

370
00:23:27,835 --> 00:23:31,100
I want to know who to be angry at.

371
00:23:31,135 --> 00:23:35,000
Here's a thought:
Don't be angry. Be thankful.

372
00:23:35,035 --> 00:23:37,396
Children are a gift, are they not?

373
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:44,654
I don't have time for this crap.
I have a party to plan.

374
00:23:45,735 --> 00:23:49,500
Thanks.- Edie.
- Hi.

375
00:23:49,535 --> 00:23:50,800
Wow, things are really coming along.

376
00:23:50,835 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah, slowly and expensively.

377
00:23:53,035 --> 00:23:56,331
It'll be worth it.
You're doing an amazing job.

378
00:23:57,835 --> 00:24:03,118
So, look, you're basically a-- predator,
and I need some advice.

379
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:09,500
... and I know Tom loves me,
but I don't trust this woman.

380
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:11,800
I think there's an agenda there.

381
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:14,300
I don't know. I bet I'm being paranoid.

382
00:24:14,335 --> 00:24:17,500
No, you did the right thing coming to me.

383
00:24:17,535 --> 00:24:20,300
There are two ways to approach this.

384
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:23,200
But first I have to ask:
What kind of shape is this woman in?

385
00:24:23,235 --> 00:24:25,600
Fantastic shape. She's gorgeous.

386
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:29,100
OK. Now there's only one way to approach this.

387
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,900
You're gonna have to act fast.

388
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:31,700
I'm listening.

389
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:35,300
It's really pretty simple.
When I feel threatened by a woman,

390
00:24:35,335 --> 00:24:38,500
I pull her in.
I make her my best friend.

391
00:24:38,535 --> 00:24:41,000
I thought you said
you didn't have any female friends.

392
00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:42,500
I don't.

393
00:24:42,535 --> 00:24:45,500
And I've never felt threatened by a woman either.

394
00:24:45,535 --> 00:24:47,700
But the point is:

395
00:24:47,735 --> 00:24:49,100
Keep your friends close,...

396
00:24:49,135 --> 00:24:53,106
... keep your enemies closer.

397
00:24:57,835 --> 00:25:03,286
Tom, we're having a dinner party.
I'm thinking of inviting Annabelle.

398
00:25:06,035 --> 00:25:08,800
We're not moving.
- Susan knows something.

399
00:25:08,835 --> 00:25:10,900
Edie said she--
- I don't care what Edie Britt said!

400
00:25:10,935 --> 00:25:12,100
I'm not leaving Julie!

401
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:16,300
You want to risk our lives, our future
over some schoolyard crush?

402
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:19,400
It's more than that.
Julie loves me.

403
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:22,000
Then why does she refuse to see you?

404
00:25:22,035 --> 00:25:25,500
Mrs Mayer lies to her.
If it wasn't for that, she would be with me.

405
00:25:25,535 --> 00:25:27,258
Are you sure?

406
00:25:28,035 --> 00:25:30,500
You know, Julie is a-- very special girl.

407
00:25:30,535 --> 00:25:30,800
I know.

408
00:25:30,835 --> 00:25:34,826
She could have just about any boy she wanted.

409
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:39,700
I think you're a wonderful kid.
I do, but--

410
00:25:39,735 --> 00:25:43,800
you're not that special, Zach.

411
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:46,447
Not really.

412
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:47,978
She kissed me.

413
00:25:48,535 --> 00:25:50,045
Lately?

414
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:54,200
Let's pack our bags and get out of here.

415
00:25:54,235 --> 00:25:56,800
We can leave this whole mess behind,
start over.

416
00:25:56,835 --> 00:25:59,700
And there will be other girls,
I promise.

417
00:25:59,735 --> 00:26:01,400
No!

418
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:03,500
If Susan goes to the police, it's over.

419
00:26:03,535 --> 00:26:06,500
They'll take me away.
They'll take you away. Don't you get that?

420
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:09,600
If Julie doesn't love me anymore,
then it doesn't matter.

421
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:11,891
None of it matters.

422
00:26:19,635 --> 00:26:22,500
Magruder had absolutely no idea 
what was going on.

423
00:26:22,535 --> 00:26:26,900
During the entire campaign,
he was practically holding Benson's hand!

424
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:31,100
After the way they burned them, screwed them over! 
That was too...

425
00:26:31,135 --> 00:26:36,000
It was awful!

426
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:38,900
Excuse me, I need to get in here
so I can clear the plates.

427
00:26:38,935 --> 00:26:42,300
You want some help with that?

428
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:43,700
Looks like we got company.

429
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,600
Hey guys, isn't it time for bed?

430
00:26:45,635 --> 00:26:49,000
Oh, they never get to see you.
Let them stay up for a while.

431
00:26:49,035 --> 00:26:52,597
OK, come here!
I want you to meet someone.

432
00:26:53,635 --> 00:26:56,000
This is Miss Foster.

433
00:26:56,035 --> 00:26:56,800
Hi.

434
00:26:56,835 --> 00:27:01,800
She's an old, <i>old</i> friend of your daddy's.

435
00:27:01,835 --> 00:27:04,700
Hey, what you got there?
- It's a picture we painted.

436
00:27:04,735 --> 00:27:07,100
Let me have a look at that.

437
00:27:07,135 --> 00:27:10,700
It's all of us with Mommy and Daddy.
We're really happy.

438
00:27:10,735 --> 00:27:14,000
It's so adorable.
When did you do this?

439
00:27:14,035 --> 00:27:16,900
Today, Mom told us to.

440
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,800
I just told them to paint something nice.
The sentiment's all theirs.

441
00:27:19,835 --> 00:27:23,500
But you told us to--
- Hold on, honey, grown-ups are talking.

442
00:27:23,535 --> 00:27:26,300
Well, this is really neat.

443
00:27:26,335 --> 00:27:29,800
How would you boys like to
paint my portrait one day?

444
00:27:29,835 --> 00:27:32,600
Sure, you're pretty.
- OK, great.

445
00:27:32,635 --> 00:27:34,900
Like your dad said, it's time for bed.

446
00:27:34,935 --> 00:27:37,300
I'll take them back upstairs.

447
00:27:37,335 --> 00:27:39,200
Come on, guys!

448
00:27:39,235 --> 00:27:41,359
Thank you.

449
00:27:47,135 --> 00:27:48,400
I must say, Lynette.

450
00:27:48,435 --> 00:27:52,600
Your home is warm and inviting,
your children are absolutely precious--

451
00:27:52,635 --> 00:27:56,600
this whole evening was practically
a commercial for the perfect family.

452
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:59,200
You think?

453
00:27:59,235 --> 00:28:04,400
You couldn't have planned it any better.
And I mean that.

454
00:28:04,435 --> 00:28:07,414
Good.

455
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:14,500
Hello, Susan.

456
00:28:14,535 --> 00:28:17,500
Oh. Hi.

457
00:28:17,535 --> 00:28:21,900
I understand you and Edie went
snooping through my house.

458
00:28:21,935 --> 00:28:22,800
Huh?

459
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:25,300
It's OK. I'm not mad.

460
00:28:25,335 --> 00:28:29,034
So, what do you want to know about Angela?

461
00:28:31,435 --> 00:28:35,900
It was Mary Alice's birth name.
She was named after her aunt Angela.

462
00:28:35,935 --> 00:28:40,000
When she was a teenager there were falling-outs.
So she changed her name into Mary Alice.

463
00:28:40,035 --> 00:28:45,246
This is before we were married,
so you'll forgive me if I'm hazy on the details.

464
00:28:45,535 --> 00:28:48,600
That's it?
That's the explanation?

465
00:28:48,635 --> 00:28:52,235
Ridiculously simple, isn't it?

466
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:57,200
She changed her name because
she got in a fight with her aunt?

467
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,700
That doesn't seem like something
Mary Alice would do.

468
00:28:59,735 --> 00:29:05,300
Neither did suicide,
but we both know that she did it.

469
00:29:05,335 --> 00:29:09,200
So can we finally put this behind us?

470
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:11,429
Or do you need to break into my home
for anything else?

471
00:29:12,908 --> 00:29:14,535
Uh--

472
00:29:16,235 --> 00:29:21,575
No.
I'm good. Thanks.

473
00:29:23,835 --> 00:29:24,900
Although--

474
00:29:24,935 --> 00:29:28,700
if you wouldn't mind,
I'd rather like to see that videotape I found.

475
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:30,300
The one marked "Angela."

476
00:29:31,635 --> 00:29:34,259
Would be nice to see Mary Alice
when she was young.

477
00:29:35,135 --> 00:29:39,055
I'm afraid that box of tapes
was thrown out with the trash.

478
00:29:41,535 --> 00:29:43,196
OK then.

479
00:29:43,435 --> 00:29:45,600
Susan--

480
00:29:45,635 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm serious when I say
I hope you'll leave my family alone now.

481
00:29:49,035 --> 00:29:53,800
This endless suspicion of yours
has become very tiring.

482
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:56,615
I couldn't agree more.

483
00:30:09,635 --> 00:30:13,591
Oh. That's my cell, sorry.

484
00:30:17,335 --> 00:30:21,700
Oh God, it's Peterson. Excuse me.
- Peterson?

485
00:30:21,735 --> 00:30:23,601
Hello? Yeah.

486
00:30:26,935 --> 00:30:29,615
That was quite a show you put on tonight.

487
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:31,668
Show?

488
00:30:32,935 --> 00:30:36,500
The boys' paintings,
all those references to how happy we are--

489
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:38,900
What's wrong with subtly reminding Annabelle
that you're happily married?

490
00:30:38,935 --> 00:30:41,654
Because it wasn't subtle.

491
00:30:41,835 --> 00:30:44,090
And it's an insult to me.

492
00:30:45,335 --> 00:30:48,295
I did not mean it that way.

493
00:30:50,635 --> 00:30:53,600
Are you so insecure that you
have to pull that crap?

494
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:56,669
Keep your voice down!

495
00:30:56,835 --> 00:31:00,800
It doesn't matter if she has feelings for me
as long as I'm not interested.

496
00:31:00,835 --> 00:31:03,700
Have I ever, ever
given you any reason to doubt me?

497
00:31:03,735 --> 00:31:08,400
Anyone is capable of anything.
The first time we ever met, you were cheating.

498
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:10,500
With you! Cheating with you!

499
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,900
It's a pattern of behavior.

500
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:13,800
Uh, give me a break!

501
00:31:13,835 --> 00:31:15,500
What am I supposed to do?

502
00:31:15,535 --> 00:31:19,400
You hire your old girlfriend and
you don't tell me about it for 3 months?

503
00:31:19,435 --> 00:31:22,500
I could've told you from Day One
and you'd still be jumping at my throat.

504
00:31:22,535 --> 00:31:24,900
Annabelle is ancient history.

505
00:31:24,935 --> 00:31:26,200
She's in the next room.

506
00:31:26,235 --> 00:31:30,500
How long do we have to be married, Lynette,
until you actually trust me?

507
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:31,700
I trust you.

508
00:31:31,735 --> 00:31:33,600
How many times have you said to me:
"If you ever touch another woman,

509
00:31:33,635 --> 00:31:37,500
"I'll take the boys and walk out of here
and you'll never see us again!"

510
00:31:37,535 --> 00:31:40,600
That's just something
wives say to their husbands.

511
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:43,700
Not all wives.

512
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:47,200
You're so convinced that I'll be unfaithful!

513
00:31:47,235 --> 00:31:51,100
It makes me sick!
The distrust, the paranoia,--

514
00:31:51,135 --> 00:31:58,100
It seems like you won't be happy until you
drive me out of this marriage to prove yourself right!

515
00:31:58,135 --> 00:32:01,600
Wait. Forget I said that.

516
00:32:01,635 --> 00:32:05,221
It's too late.
You said it.

517
00:32:05,535 --> 00:32:10,379
Well, then just consider it something
husbands say to their wives.

518
00:32:11,635 --> 00:32:17,200
Peterson's on cloud nine.
He discovered some inside scoop on the Metro account.

519
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,700
The bad news is,
we'll have to redo the entire presentation.

520
00:32:20,735 --> 00:32:21,700
Tonight?

521
00:32:21,735 --> 00:32:23,000
He'll need it first thing in the morning.

522
00:32:23,035 --> 00:32:26,500
Peterson says we might be pulling an all-nighter.

523
00:32:26,535 --> 00:32:28,500
I can't drive. I've been drinking.

524
00:32:28,535 --> 00:32:31,600
I'll drive. Come on.
- Thanks.

525
00:32:31,635 --> 00:32:35,692
Don't worry, Lynette.
I'll deliver him back to you as soon as I can.

526
00:32:36,835 --> 00:32:38,718
Please do.

527
00:32:52,635 --> 00:32:56,200
Honey, take over for a minute.
I'm giving a speech.

528
00:32:56,235 --> 00:32:58,518
Make sure they stay pink like that, OK?

529
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,200
Are you OK?

530
00:33:01,235 --> 00:33:09,500
Oh. I just--
realize how disgusting meat can be.

531
00:33:09,535 --> 00:33:13,600
Everyone, I just want to say
it means a lot to me that you all came,

532
00:33:13,635 --> 00:33:18,600
and as you know, in a few days
I'll be taking a little government-sponsored vacation.

533
00:33:18,635 --> 00:33:22,324
Lucky for me, breakfast is included.

534
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:25,000
Oh God.

535
00:33:25,035 --> 00:33:28,700
The bottom line is,
I'm going away to jail.

536
00:33:28,735 --> 00:33:33,900
And when a man has to go to jail,
which I hope none of you will ever have to do,

537
00:33:33,935 --> 00:33:36,300
he sees who his real friends are.

538
00:33:36,335 --> 00:33:38,850
So thanks.

539
00:33:39,135 --> 00:33:40,750
Cheers!

540
00:33:48,535 --> 00:33:50,987
Excuse you.

541
00:33:53,635 --> 00:33:57,800
Stay put until I need you.
Don't talk to anybody and, for God's sake,

542
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,000
don't get drunk!

543
00:33:59,035 --> 00:34:00,900
You know I was supposed to
go to my cousin's wedding today.

544
00:34:00,935 --> 00:34:05,100
It's not a wedding, it's a commitment.
So sit down and

545
00:34:05,135 --> 00:34:07,862
try to fit in.

546
00:34:13,035 --> 00:34:16,143
Urghh.

547
00:34:27,435 --> 00:34:29,200
Got you a hot dog.

548
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:30,700
No thanks. I'm full.

549
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:34,500
They have a croquet set.
You wanna go hit some balls?

550
00:34:34,535 --> 00:34:35,600
No.

551
00:34:35,635 --> 00:34:37,300
That's fine. We can just sit here.

552
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:38,369
Zach!

553
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,200
I don't want to be your girlfriend.

554
00:34:40,235 --> 00:34:46,600
I don't want to hang out with you.
I just want you to leave me alone, OK?

555
00:34:46,635 --> 00:34:48,235
OK--

556
00:35:28,535 --> 00:35:31,000
<i>In that moment,

557
00:35:31,035 --> 00:35:34,200
<i>while looking at the pills
that had been so obviously tampered with,

558
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:40,300
<i>Gabrielle's nausea was suddenly replaced
by an even stronger sensation:

559
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:41,952
<i>rage.

560
00:35:58,935 --> 00:36:00,356
What are you doing?

561
00:36:00,835 --> 00:36:03,400
I'm so sorry.
That was an accident.

562
00:36:03,435 --> 00:36:05,900
Answer my question:
What are you doing here?

563
00:36:05,935 --> 00:36:07,200
I was invited.

564
00:36:07,235 --> 00:36:10,000
By who?
- You know what, Dr Van de Kamp?

565
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:12,600
I don't believe I have to answer to you.
- I think you do.

566
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:13,700
What's going on here?

567
00:36:13,735 --> 00:36:17,600
He crashed the party.
This guy clearly is not taking "no" for an answer.

568
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:20,900
It's OK. George has a girlfriend.

569
00:36:20,935 --> 00:36:22,000
You brought her, didn't you?

570
00:36:22,035 --> 00:36:24,700
He doesn't have a girlfriend.
- I do, sir.

571
00:36:24,735 --> 00:36:26,500
She's right over there.

572
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:31,500
That's his girlfriend?

573
00:36:31,535 --> 00:36:35,100
See? You were worried for nothing.

574
00:36:35,135 --> 00:36:39,767
So, any time you want to apologize--

575
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:44,575
Come on, Rex.
You owe George some sort of gesture.

576
00:36:49,935 --> 00:36:52,628
What the hell.

577
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,200
Rex! Have you lost your mind?

578
00:37:03,235 --> 00:37:06,208
To be fair, I only pushed <i>him</i>.

579
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,200
Carlos! You son of a bitch!

580
00:37:09,235 --> 00:37:12,457
I am pregnant and it's all your fault!

581
00:37:20,035 --> 00:37:20,900
Wow.

582
00:37:20,935 --> 00:37:24,340
This is turning into one hell of a party.

583
00:37:29,135 --> 00:37:31,200
Are you OK?

584
00:37:31,235 --> 00:37:35,000
I think I can honestly say:
No. I'm not.

585
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:37,600
I'm so sorry.

586
00:37:37,635 --> 00:37:39,300
Thanks.

587
00:37:39,335 --> 00:37:42,600
But you know what they say about kids:

588
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,300
that you can't imagine having them
until you do,

589
00:37:45,335 --> 00:37:48,900
and then you can't imagine
life without them?

590
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:50,549
It's true.

591
00:37:54,035 --> 00:37:58,700
All I'm saying is,
maybe this is a blessing in disguise.

592
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,400
I don't know who the father is.

593
00:38:01,435 --> 00:38:04,400
What?
- Yeah.

594
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:07,300
So you mean you and John have still been...
- Yeah.

595
00:38:07,335 --> 00:38:08,500
Gabby!

596
00:38:08,535 --> 00:38:10,954
I know, Susan! I don't know what to do!

597
00:38:12,235 --> 00:38:14,300
Oh! Oh my God!

598
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:15,600
That-- that's my house!

599
00:38:15,635 --> 00:38:21,566
Call 911?
- Yes, that's my house!

600
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:27,845
Oh, look, my kitchen!
Oh, it's a big fire!

601
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:33,900
Turns out someone left the gas on
with candles burning.

602
00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:38,300
That's impossible.
We don't burn candles during the day.

603
00:38:38,335 --> 00:38:43,900
Uh, well-- I-- did have
a French vanilla candle burning earlier, but--

604
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:46,200
I'm almost positive I blew it out!

605
00:38:46,235 --> 00:38:48,115
You're <i>almost</i> positive?

606
00:38:50,235 --> 00:38:54,300
Yes! I did! I-- I think.

607
00:38:54,335 --> 00:38:59,100
You're lucky the fire was contained.
The damage could've been far more extensive.

608
00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:02,783
You've got to be more careful from now on.

609
00:39:09,235 --> 00:39:12,859
Don't worry. We will be.

610
00:39:17,935 --> 00:39:20,525
Bree, hi.
- Hi.

611
00:39:21,135 --> 00:39:22,100
You left the party so quickly,

612
00:39:22,135 --> 00:39:27,100
I didn't have a chance to apologize to you
for what Rex did.

613
00:39:27,135 --> 00:39:31,500
Oh George, I'm so sorry
he humiliated you in front of all these people.

614
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,200
I don't know what got into him.

615
00:39:33,235 --> 00:39:35,700
Isn't it obvious?
He hates me.

616
00:39:35,735 --> 00:39:40,700
No, he doesn't hate you.
He really doesn't even know you, and you don't know him.

617
00:39:40,735 --> 00:39:44,434
I know this much:
he won't let us be friends.

618
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:48,900
Well, that's not his choice to make.

619
00:39:48,935 --> 00:39:52,700
What if he asked you not to see me anymore?

620
00:39:52,735 --> 00:39:55,100
What if he orders you not to?

621
00:39:55,135 --> 00:39:56,500
Well--

622
00:39:56,535 --> 00:40:00,300
I decide who I need in my life,
and I've decided that I need you.

623
00:40:00,335 --> 00:40:03,500
That's all there is to it.

624
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:07,000
He could make it awfully difficult
for you to spend time with me.

625
00:40:07,035 --> 00:40:08,312
Well--

626
00:40:08,335 --> 00:40:12,327
Who says he has to know
how I spend my free time?

627
00:40:24,835 --> 00:40:28,200
I'm having trouble 
with a family across the street.

628
00:40:28,235 --> 00:40:31,500
I think one of them 
may have set a fire in my house,

629
00:40:31,535 --> 00:40:33,200
and I don't know why, but

630
00:40:33,235 --> 00:40:40,700
I feel like it's got something to do with
my friend who killed herself.

631
00:40:40,735 --> 00:40:44,842
I called the police,
but they didn't take me seriously.

632
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:49,900
This family has got a secret.
A bad secret.

633
00:40:49,935 --> 00:40:51,200
I think I'm in over my head.

634
00:40:51,235 --> 00:40:57,798
I need you to find out everything about
Paul Young and his family.

635
00:40:58,335 --> 00:41:00,703
Do you think you can help me?

636
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:07,584
As a matter of fact,
I know I can.

637
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:15,900
<i>Spring comes every year to Wisteria Lane.

638
00:41:15,935 --> 00:41:21,500
<i>But not everyone remembers to
stop and smell the flowers.

639
00:41:21,535 --> 00:41:27,500
<i>Some are too busy
worrying about the future

640
00:41:27,535 --> 00:41:33,300
<i>or mistakes they've made in the past.

641
00:41:33,335 --> 00:41:37,265
<i>Others are preoccupied with not getting caught,

642
00:41:40,135 --> 00:41:41,798
It's a window!

643
00:41:41,798 --> 00:41:51,800
<i>or thinking of ways
to catch someone else.

644
00:41:51,835 --> 00:41:57,300
<i>Still, there will always be a few
who remember to take a moment

645
00:41:57,335 --> 00:42:00,887
<i>and appreciate what Spring has given them,

646
00:42:03,535 --> 00:42:09,400
