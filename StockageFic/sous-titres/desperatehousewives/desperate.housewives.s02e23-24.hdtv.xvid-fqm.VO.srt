1
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,337
oh, please,
that's what neighbors are for.

2
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,771
well,
welcome to wisteria lane.

3
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,771
when you're
finished unpacking,

4
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:21,270
why don't you come over
for a cup of coffee?

5
00:07:21,304 --> 00:07:23,270
oh, wow!

6
00:07:23,304 --> 00:07:27,904
i have a neighbor who just
asked me over for coffee.

7
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,304
i'm sorry.
you must think i'm a lunatic.

8
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:35,103
oh, no, no, i don't.
i think you're charming.

9
00:07:35,137 --> 00:07:37,370
and your baby looks
like a genius to me.

10
00:07:37,404 --> 00:07:39,537
oh, she is.

11
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:42,137
and we're gonna be
so happy here.

12
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,337
(gasps)
look at your new home.

13
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:51,771
you're not gonna walk me
into a wall, are you?

14
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,771
of course not, but when
yosee it for the first time,

15
00:07:54,804 --> 00:07:57,370
i want you to get
the whole impact.

16
00:07:57,404 --> 00:07:59,337
ta-da!

17
00:08:00,837 --> 00:08:03,004
okay, now i know
it's a little more cramped

18
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:05,504
than we're used to, but we
can't stay at bree's forever.

19
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:07,904
she's gonna be coming back
from that spa vacation soon.

20
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:10,203
besides, it's gonna be fun.
why are you doing this to me?

21
00:08:10,237 --> 00:08:12,404
i get good grades.
i don't do drugs.

22
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:14,771
i've never come home
pregnant.

23
00:08:14,804 --> 00:08:18,237
honey, i am trying my hardest
to stand on my own two feet.

24
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,771
all right, i've got six
book proposals in the works.

25
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:24,170
i'm gonna try to supervise
the rebuilding of this house,

26
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,671
but you know, i can't do it
without your support.

27
00:08:26,704 --> 00:08:30,404
and i want you
to be proud of me.

28
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:36,103
(sighs) fine.
let's take a look inside.

29
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:38,604
ohh! that's my girl.
(giggles)

30
00:08:38,637 --> 00:08:42,038
so... is there anything
you should prepare me for?

31
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,437
no! no. it's all good.

32
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,604
oh! but you should know

33
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:48,571
that your bed doubles
as the dining table,

34
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:50,604
and the toilet's
in the shower.

35
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:54,637
honey, look. i bought us
matching golf outfits

36
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:56,404
for our lessons tomorrow.

37
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:57,904
yeah, about that--
i can't go.

38
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,904
i gotta pick up trash
on the freeway.

39
00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:01,370
i'm sorry?

40
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:02,737
i have to do
my community service.

41
00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:04,737
it's part of my parole,
remember?

42
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:07,237
oh, okay, well, i'll just
call the country club

43
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,203
and cancel our lessons.
no, no, no.

44
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:12,070
i an, i paid already.
might as well go without me.

45
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:14,938
i don't wanna go alone. it was
your idea in the first place.

46
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,938
and i'd love to be there
with you, too,

47
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:19,137
if i didn't have to scrape
slushies and condoms

48
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,137
off route 57.
look, what's the big deal?

49
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,637
just go take
the stupid lesson.

50
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:25,304
fine, if you feel
that way about it.
hey, i'm sorry.

51
00:09:27,604 --> 00:09:30,038
oh, would you look
at this crap?

52
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,070
he has been doing that all day.

53
00:09:36,737 --> 00:09:39,437
ralph has a little crush.
so?

54
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,470
so can't i get a gardener

55
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:43,971
who isn't trying to sleep
with someone in my house?

56
00:09:44,004 --> 00:09:47,637
you pay 6 bucks an hour.
it's all about the perks, honey.

57
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,804
susan,
have you talked to lynette?

58
00:09:55,837 --> 00:09:58,504
uh, no.
have you trieder cell?

59
00:09:58,537 --> 00:10:01,337
yeah, she isn't picking up.
do you know where she is?

60
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,671
uh, no, i'm sorry.

61
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:06,470
susan, i think you do.

62
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:09,304
i really don't, tom.

63
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:10,804
is everything okay?

64
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:12,571
yeah. yeah,
we just had a fight.

65
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:14,904
listen, if you talk to her,

66
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:17,938
will you please ask her
to call me?

67
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:21,038
thank you.

68
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:31,103
(cell phone rings)
hello?

69
00:10:31,137 --> 00:10:33,737
he was just here.

70
00:10:33,771 --> 00:10:35,737
i think you should call him.

71
00:10:35,771 --> 00:10:40,704
i can't. i can't.
i'm sorry. i just can't.

72
00:10:40,737 --> 00:10:42,437
mom!
yeah. hang on.

73
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,237
i'll call you later.
okay. bye.

74
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,537
yeah?

75
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:49,437
when is daddy coming?
i wanna show him my dive.

76
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,737
he's not coming, sweetheart.

77
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,203
but you could show me.

78
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:06,704
(indistinct conversations)

79
00:11:06,737 --> 00:11:08,704
you have to talk to noah.

80
00:11:08,737 --> 00:11:11,270
but he creeps me out.
who cares?

81
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,771
this is my life
we're talking about.

82
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:14,804
i need a big-time lawyer
in my corner,

83
00:11:14,837 --> 00:11:17,304
and where else are we gonna
get that kind of money?

84
00:11:17,337 --> 00:11:20,237
noah's not gonna give me a dime
if he knows it's for you.

85
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,270
he hates your guts.
tell him it's for you.

86
00:11:22,304 --> 00:11:23,971
tell him you want a car.

87
00:11:24,004 --> 00:11:26,504
tell him you're ready for him
to buy your love. trust me.

88
00:11:26,537 --> 00:11:28,737
dying men are nothing
if not sentimental.

89
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,737
why do you need so much,
anyway?

90
00:11:30,771 --> 00:11:34,237
i thought only guilty men
needed expensive lawyers.

91
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,837
felicia has obviously been
planning this for months.

92
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:39,938
who knows what other kind
of evidence she's planted?

93
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:42,737
with my luck, they'll open up
the martha huber murder again,

94
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:44,737
try to nail me
with some d.n.a.

95
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:49,070
you swore to me that you had
nothing to do with that.

96
00:11:49,103 --> 00:11:51,137
i didn't.

97
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,571
look, why are we arguing?

98
00:11:53,604 --> 00:11:57,038
i'm your father.
do what i'm telling you to do.

99
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,938
you're not my real father.

100
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:04,270
you ungrateful little...

101
00:12:04,304 --> 00:12:06,604
i rescue you
from that miserable junkie.

102
00:12:06,637 --> 00:12:08,604
i give you a home,
a life worth living,

103
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:16,103
i need the money, zach.

104
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:18,103
if you won't do it for me,

105
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,304
at least do it
for your mother.

106
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:25,671
after all, she killed herself
trying to protect you.

107
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:40,994
 <i>i met bree van de kamp</i>

108
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,493
 <i>the first day she moved</i>
 <i>to wisteria lane.</i>

109
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:45,994
 <i>there are certain people,</i>
 <i>who, when you meet them,</i>

110
00:12:46,027 --> 00:12:49,428
 <i>can't help but make</i>
 <i>a delightful first impression.</i>

111
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,027
hello. i'm bree van de kamp,
your new neighbor.

112
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:53,527
is this your frog?

113
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,894
 <i>bree was not one of them.</i>

114
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:57,227
yes. why?

115
00:12:57,261 --> 00:13:01,560
well, it seems that my son
stole it from your yard.

116
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:03,294
oh, well, i don't mind.

117
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:05,827
if he likes it so much,
he's welcome to keep it.

118
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,827
well, don't tell him that.

119
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,328
if he doesn't feel guilty,
he'll never learn shame.

120
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:12,294
hey, what's going on?

121
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:14,894
oh. um, this i
our new neighbor.

122
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,394
it seems her son accidentally
took my garden frog.

123
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:18,994
oh.

124
00:13:19,027 --> 00:13:20,994
please don't make excuses
for him.

125
00:13:21,027 --> 00:13:23,827
that is exactly what
his father does. rex!

126
00:13:28,328 --> 00:13:30,094
this is my husband rex.

127
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:33,094
hi. we're not weird.
we just seem like we are.

128
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:36,227
and this is my son...

129
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:37,460
the criminal.

130
00:13:38,727 --> 00:13:40,127
go on.

131
00:13:41,493 --> 00:13:43,460
i'm sorry i stole from you.

132
00:13:43,493 --> 00:13:47,027
just so you know, my mom
did teach me right from wrong,

133
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:48,961
so my actions should in no way

134
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,294
influence your opinion
of her as a parent.

135
00:13:54,827 --> 00:13:58,460
wow.
well, is there anything
you'd like to say to my son?

136
00:13:58,493 --> 00:14:00,560
feel free to be harsh.

137
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:05,460
no, i'm... i'm good.

138
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:08,361
well, now that we've finished
with all this unpleasantness,

139
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:10,361
i want to assure you

140
00:14:10,394 --> 00:14:12,361
that we are going to be
good neighbors,

141
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:15,261
and i hope in time,
great friends.

142
00:14:15,294 --> 00:14:17,760
that sounds... lovely.

143
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:20,627
come on.

144
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,627
oh, wait.
i'm--i'm sorry.

145
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,027
it was rex, andrew and...
what was your name again?

146
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:29,460
bree?

147
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,527
what?

148
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,527
you're bree van de kamp,
right?

149
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,027
do i know you?

150
00:14:34,061 --> 00:14:37,527
orson hodge.
uh, susan's dentist friend.

151
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,527
we met after her house
burned down.

152
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,694
oh. i'm so sorry.
i didn't recognize you.

153
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:44,660
small word, huh?

154
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:47,660
yes. uh, excruciatingly so.

155
00:14:47,694 --> 00:14:48,794
ah.

156
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:51,127
what are you doing here?

157
00:14:51,161 --> 00:14:54,660
well, three or four times
a week, i visit my--my friend.

158
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,460
what about you?

159
00:14:57,493 --> 00:15:00,493
oh, i just thought id be
a lovely place

160
00:15:00,527 --> 00:15:02,493
to take a nice, long rest.

161
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,127
ah.

162
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:05,394
um, listen,

163
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:08,527
i told my friends that
i was, um, i was at a spa,

164
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,294
so if you run into susan,
i--
your secret is safe.

165
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,493
and seriously...

166
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:15,294
(lowers voice) i am not
like these other people.

167
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:17,961
oh, i can tell.

168
00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:19,994
a real lady always
stands out in a crowd.

169
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:23,394
well, that was...
very sweet.

170
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:27,328
enjoy your rest,
bree van de kamp.

171
00:15:33,694 --> 00:15:36,760
boy, do i feel for you.

172
00:15:36,794 --> 00:15:39,694
trying to convince your friends
that you're still normal,

173
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:41,694
and you're surrounded
by a bunch of loons.

174
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:43,261
you, too?

175
00:15:43,294 --> 00:15:45,194
oh, please.

176
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:48,161
dr. barr goes out of his way
to make me feel

177
00:15:48,194 --> 00:15:49,660
like a complete psychopath.

178
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:52,593
i think he's crazier
than the patients, actually.

179
00:15:55,094 --> 00:15:58,261
you know that, um,
that woman in the wheelchair?

180
00:15:58,294 --> 00:16:01,061
what's her story?
yeah, she's a kooky one.

181
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,061
she hasn't spoken a word
since she got here.

182
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:04,560
she just sits there
all day long

183
00:16:04,593 --> 00:16:06,760
waiting for your friend
to come and visit.

184
00:16:06,794 --> 00:16:08,727
he talks to her for hours,

185
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,460
but i don't even think
she can hear him.

186
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,961
oh, hi.

187
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:26,161
you said to stop by
for coffee sometime.

188
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:29,227
i got coffee.

189
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:32,394
so i can't believe
you caught me spraying for ants.

190
00:16:32,428 --> 00:16:34,394
i must look like a wreck.

191
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:36,394
actually,
you look kinda sexy.

192
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:37,927
you've gotta be kidding.

193
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:40,493
oh, the way you're taking
charge--it's impressive.

194
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:42,894
they're just ants,
and they're tiny.

195
00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:44,894
of course,
they do outnumber me.

196
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:47,394
oh, you said you wanted
to handle things yourself,

197
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:49,894
and you're making it happen.
it's good to see.

198
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,361
thanks.

199
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:54,361
even if it does mean

200
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:57,094
you're not in the market
for a relationship right now.

201
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:59,794
oh. did i say that?

202
00:16:59,827 --> 00:17:02,428
you certainly implied it.

203
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,961
well, sometimes i say things
i don't mean.

204
00:17:05,994 --> 00:17:10,560
i blame it on my frequent
exposure to ant spray.

205
00:17:10,593 --> 00:17:12,961
what the hell is this?

206
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:15,860
karl. what do you want?

207
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:17,994
well, i can't believe
you're forcing our daughter

208
00:17:18,027 --> 00:17:19,994
to live in a house
with wheels.

209
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:21,994
i think we need
to talk about this.

210
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:23,094
it's temporary,

211
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:25,593
and if you don't mind,
i'm having coffee.

212
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,527
oh, it's okay, susan.

213
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,794
hey, sorry. i don't mean
to chase you out, buddy,

214
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:33,227
but, uh, this is really
a family thing.

215
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,261
oh, no, i understand.

216
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:36,560
cool.

217
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
mmm.

218
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:46,727
ll call you later.

219
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:54,961
you've got a great swing.

220
00:17:54,994 --> 00:17:57,460
you just need a little help
around the greens.

221
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,460
you know what they say--

222
00:17:59,493 --> 00:18:01,961
drive for show,
putt for dough. am i right?

223
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:03,961
(laughs) that is so true.

224
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:05,961
all right.
i'll see you out there.
okay.

225
00:18:05,994 --> 00:18:08,194
make me something strong.

226
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:10,593
i have nine more holes
with that guy.

227
00:18:10,627 --> 00:18:13,760
 <i>jim, it was just an hour ago</i>

239
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:52,360
mrs. solis!
why you home?

240
00:18:52,394 --> 00:18:56,494
carlos is dead, xiao-mei.

241
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:58,594
no, please don't kill him.

242
00:18:58,627 --> 00:19:01,460
no, you don't understand.
he's already dead.

243
00:19:01,494 --> 00:19:03,193
there was an accident.

244
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:06,327
he's all over the highway.

245
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,460
no...

246
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:10,527
he in kitchen.

247
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,794
hey, babe.
why you home so early?

248
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,961
oh, honey!
oh, you're not dead!

249
00:19:24,994 --> 00:19:26,994
who said i was dead?

250
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:30,460
the police. they called me.
what are you talking about?

251
00:19:30,494 --> 00:19:32,460
honey, they didn't know
all the details,

252
00:19:32,494 --> 00:19:34,460
but a witness said
that they saw you

253
00:19:34,494 --> 00:19:37,460
run into the carpool lane
to pick up a lawn chair

254
00:19:37,494 --> 00:19:38,961
that had fallen
off some truck,

255
00:19:38,994 --> 00:19:41,727
and then a bus hit you
right in front of the road crew.

256
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:45,694
why aren't you
at the road crew?
i paid ralph
to go in my place.

257
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,160
what?

258
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:50,227
well, carlos,
they had your name.

259
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,093
oh, no. poor ralph.

260
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:54,827
oh!

261
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,794
why is your back
all sweaty?

262
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:59,028
i was working out
on the treadmill.

263
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,961
barefoot?

264
00:20:00,994 --> 00:20:03,460
(scoffs) for god sakes,
gabrielle, ralph just died,

265
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,460
and you're worried
about my feet?

266
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:09,327
i mean, what the hell
is wrong with you?

267
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,160
my fault.
sorry.

268
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,994
you must find that
very peaceful.

269
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:30,227
why would you assume that?

270
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,227
because that's all you've been
doing for three sessions.

271
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,327
i still don't know
anything about you,

272
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,394
except that you rake
in remarkably straight lines.

273
00:20:38,427 --> 00:20:40,394
is that what you're doing,

274
00:20:40,427 --> 00:20:42,394
asking me all those
ridiculous questns

275
00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:44,894
about my childhood,
trying to get to know me?

276
00:20:44,928 --> 00:20:46,861
well, here's a clue.
i'm not crazy.

277
00:20:46,894 --> 00:20:50,360
i just have a few issues.
and psychotherapy is how we
help you deal with those issues.

278
00:20:50,394 --> 00:20:54,360
what kind of treatment did you
think you were going to get?
honestly, i was hoping

279
00:20:54,394 --> 00:20:56,093
that you'd medicate
the hell out of me.

280
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:58,127
you don't need
anything stronger

281
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,127
than what i've already
prescribed for you.

282
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,227
i have aspirin at home
that packs more of a punch.

283
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,028
it says here
your husband died,

284
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,028
you had a boyfriend
who killed himself,

285
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,060
and you suffer
from alcoholism.

286
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:13,761
that's a lot of trauma
for one year.

287
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:16,460
what about your kids?

288
00:21:16,494 --> 00:21:19,794
oh, they're fine.

289
00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:22,193
andrew is backpacking
through europe,

290
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:25,494
and danielle is away
at cheerleading camp.

291
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:27,327
what's your relationship
with them like?

292
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:31,028
what do you mean?

293
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,561
are you close?

294
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:35,327
do they share things
with you?

295
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,427
what do you feel
about them?

296
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:42,928
you know, i really don't
have time for this nonsense.

297
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:45,928
are you going to give me
some serious drugs or not?

298
00:21:45,961 --> 00:21:48,127
no.

299
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,961
fine. then i'm going back
to my room.

300
00:21:49,994 --> 00:21:52,527
you know, bree, i can't
force you to open up to me,

301
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:56,160
but i can make it easier for
you to focus on your problems.

302
00:21:56,193 --> 00:21:57,994
and how are you
going to do that?

303
00:21:58,028 --> 00:22:00,060
i'm gog
to tell the orderlies

304
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:02,060
to confiscate
all your personal items.

305
00:22:02,093 --> 00:22:04,227
i committed myself
voluntarily.

306
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,227
when you signed
those pars,

307
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,427
i became responsible
for your well-being,

308
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,394
and i will help you
in any way i see fit.
i don't need that much help,

309
00:22:12,427 --> 00:22:14,928
because i am not like
your other patients.
oh, sure, you are.

310
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:17,160
you just don't know it yet.

311
00:22:29,627 --> 00:22:32,727
your s confessed to murder.
we've got it on tape.

312
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:35,694
my son has the mind
of a child, detective.

313
00:22:35,727 --> 00:22:37,861
he'd confess to sinking
the "titanic."

314
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,494
this letter was sent
some months ago

315
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,827
to the chicago police,
saying the person they arrested

316
00:22:45,861 --> 00:22:47,928
for the melanie foster murder
was innocent.

317
00:22:47,961 --> 00:22:49,327
we have a hunch
you wrote it.

318
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,360
really? i didn't know hunches
were considered evidence

319
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:54,060
in a court of law.

320
00:22:54,093 --> 00:22:56,127
(chuckles) they aren't.

321
00:22:59,427 --> 00:23:01,961
but this is.

322
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:04,460
we found some of
the assailant's d.n.a.

323
00:23:04,494 --> 00:23:06,294
on this jacket.

324
00:23:06,327 --> 00:23:10,260
now all we need
is a matching sample.

325
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:13,494
you, by any chance,
recognize the jacket?

326
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,427
it's not caleb's.

327
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,093
you can try and deny it,
but...

328
00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:24,427
no.

329
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,294
you don't understand.

330
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:31,961
that jacket belongs
to my other son.

331
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:53,994
(coughing)

332
00:23:56,661 --> 00:24:00,561
and out of nowhere,
he just attacked me.

333
00:24:00,594 --> 00:24:02,727
my brother's
never been violent.

334
00:24:02,761 --> 00:24:05,227
i'm sure he didn't mean
to hurt you.

335
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,694
but he did.

336
00:24:09,794 --> 00:24:11,961
let me just take you home.

337
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:19,227
this has been
pretty traumatic for me.

338
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,227
i-i-i think that you should
come over for the next few days

339
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,227
so we can talk it out.

340
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,294
we broke up, mel. it is not
my job to hold your hand.

341
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,994
well, maybe i shouldn't
go home right away.

342
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,327
maybe i should go
to the cops first.

343
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,561
the cops?

344
00:24:37,594 --> 00:24:39,494
i was attacked.

345
00:24:39,527 --> 00:24:42,527
it's my civic duty to report it,
don't you think?

346
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:44,527
mel, i just told you

347
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:47,594
that caleb did not mean
to do what he did, okay?

348
00:24:47,627 --> 00:24:49,127
melanie, please.
screw you.

349
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:51,427
no, you cannot tell anybody
about this!

350
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,961
i can tell who i want!
get your hands off of me!
we're talking
about my brother here!

351
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,961
your brother is going to go
to jail for the next ten years,

352
00:24:57,994 --> 00:25:00,727
so i say let go!

353
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,761
hey, melanie!

354
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,060
what?!

355
00:25:07,193 --> 00:25:11,028
you leave my family alone!
uhh!

356
00:25:48,304 --> 00:25:50,304
 <i>we all met lynette scavo</i>

357
00:25:50,337 --> 00:25:52,304
 <i>the day</i>
 <i>she moved onto wisteria lane.</i>

358
00:25:52,337 --> 00:25:55,837
 <i>we quickly decided</i>
 <i>she would be our friend,</i>

359
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:59,937
 <i>mostly because we were</i>
 <i>afraid to have her as an enemy.</i>

360
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,638
...playing russian roulette
with my ovaries and--
...lynette!

361
00:26:05,803 --> 00:26:07,237
hi.
hi.

362
00:26:07,271 --> 00:26:09,237
hi. uh, we just
wanted to come

363
00:26:09,271 --> 00:26:11,237
welcome you
to the neighborhood.

364
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:14,738
um, but we could
come back later.
yeah.

365
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,070
no, wait. actually, wait.
this is perfect.

366
00:26:17,104 --> 00:26:19,638
you know why? beuse we need
some impartial judges.
lynette...

367
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:22,170
let's suppose your husband
begged you to get pregnant--

368
00:26:22,204 --> 00:26:24,104
begged you--and out
of the goodness of your heart,

369
00:26:24,137 --> 00:26:26,704
you agreed, even though
it might derail your career.

370
00:26:26,738 --> 00:26:28,704
you agreed to a baby.
 <i>a</i> baby, singular.

371
00:26:28,738 --> 00:26:30,671
lynette, we've just met
these people.

372
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:32,903
then--then you go in
for an ultrasound,

373
00:26:32,937 --> 00:26:34,903
and you hear
two heartbeats.

374
00:26:34,937 --> 00:26:37,404
then and only then does
your husband tell you

375
00:26:37,437 --> 00:26:39,404
that twins run
in his family.

376
00:26:39,437 --> 00:26:41,571
i didn't think
it was that big a deal!

377
00:26:41,604 --> 00:26:43,571
your family had
eight sets of twins

378
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:45,004
over three generations,

379
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:46,970
not to mention your relatives
in kentucky with triplets!

380
00:26:47,004 --> 00:26:49,271
triplets! so i ask you,

381
00:26:49,304 --> 00:26:52,671
do i not deserve to punish
this man severely?

382
00:26:52,704 --> 00:26:54,170
well, actually, i think

383
00:26:54,204 --> 00:26:57,970
that twins are genetically
determined by the mother.

384
00:26:58,004 --> 00:27:00,004
what are you,
a scientist?

385
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:03,604
no. no,
i write children's books.

386
00:27:03,638 --> 00:27:06,803
um, we, uh, just came over
to introduce ourselves,

387
00:27:06,837 --> 00:27:10,004
but we can, um,
do that at another time.

388
00:27:10,037 --> 00:27:11,803
no, wait. please stay.
it's okay.

389
00:27:11,837 --> 00:27:13,803
we're okay.
we're okay, right?

390
00:27:13,837 --> 00:27:17,571
honey, we don't wanna
frk out the new neighbors.

391
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:20,037
i'm sorry that you saw
my panic attack.

392
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,704
i won't
let it happen again,

393
00:27:22,738 --> 00:27:25,204
especially since this is 
my last pregnancy.

394
00:27:25,237 --> 00:27:28,638
right. you're the boss.
i'm just your love slave.

395
00:27:28,671 --> 00:27:30,738
aw.

396
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,237
well, don't encourage him.

397
00:27:32,271 --> 00:27:34,738
honey, clearly,our new neighbo

398
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,404
that you have been gifted
with a phenomenal husband.

399
00:27:40,671 --> 00:27:42,571
(boy) cannonball!

400
00:27:42,604 --> 00:27:43,903
guys?

401
00:27:43,937 --> 00:27:45,870
could you come here
for a second?

402
00:27:45,903 --> 00:27:48,537
we need to have
a serious ta.

403
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:57,337
okay, we have had
a great... vacation,

404
00:27:57,371 --> 00:27:59,704
but tomorrow
we're going home.

405
00:27:59,738 --> 00:28:04,537
except we're not going
to <i>our</i> home.

406
00:28:04,571 --> 00:28:07,537
we're gonna go stay
with grandma.

407
00:28:07,571 --> 00:28:10,671
is dad
gonna be there?

408
00:28:10,704 --> 00:28:12,671
no, dad is not
gonna be there,

409
00:28:12,704 --> 00:28:17,437
but he--he is gonna come
and see you guys all the time.

410
00:28:17,471 --> 00:28:20,937
we are still
gonna be a family.

411
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,271
it's just...

412
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:29,004
we won't be living
in the same place anymore.

413
00:28:29,037 --> 00:28:32,837
so...

414
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,704
is there any questions
you wanna ask me?

415
00:28:38,404 --> 00:28:40,237
can we go
swimming now?

416
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,803
(boy) cannonball!

417
00:29:09,937 --> 00:29:11,638
mike, what a surprise.

418
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:14,504
yeah. how's it goin'?

419
00:29:14,537 --> 00:29:16,170
good, good. i'm...

420
00:29:16,204 --> 00:29:21,170
just came in to get
a new battery for my watch.

421
00:29:21,204 --> 00:29:24,237
so... whatcha doin'?

422
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:26,237
oh, just buying something
for my grandma.

423
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:27,738
it's her 90th birthday.

424
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,070
here we go.

425
00:29:29,104 --> 00:29:31,137
this will sweep her
right off her feet.

426
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:35,937
it's elegant, and she can
build on it for anniversaries.

427
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,803
lucky grandma. (laughs)

428
00:29:38,837 --> 00:29:41,837
you dog. you're gonna ask
susan to marry you, aren't you?

429
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:44,137
i didn't say that.
man, i'm cool.

430
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,070
as far as i'm concerned,
san's old news, so...

431
00:29:47,104 --> 00:29:48,604
mazel tov.

432
00:29:48,638 --> 00:29:50,604
i don't suppose
there's any hope

433
00:29:50,638 --> 00:29:53,437
of you keeping your mouth shut
about this, is there?

434
00:29:53,471 --> 00:29:56,437
i wanted to surprise her.
oh, trust me, brother.
she'll be surprised,

435
00:29:56,471 --> 00:29:59,770
and not just
by how small that rock is.

436
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,404
ach) look, i-i know
it's an expensive car,

437
00:30:08,437 --> 00:30:11,870
but i need one,
so can i get the money?

438
00:30:14,371 --> 00:30:16,870
you're a lousy liar, kid.
i read the papers.

439
00:30:16,903 --> 00:30:19,870
i know what happened
to your father.

440
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:24,537
my guess is he's in the market
for a fancy lawyer

441
00:30:24,571 --> 00:30:27,970
to get him
some rich man's justice.

442
00:30:28,004 --> 00:30:29,671
please.

443
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:33,504
paul young put deirdre
in a box.

444
00:30:33,537 --> 00:30:35,638
my daughter. your mother.

445
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:39,271
so we're clear,

446
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:42,704
i don't write checks
to monsters.

447
00:30:42,738 --> 00:30:45,638
(voice breaking) why can't you
just give me the money?

448
00:30:45,671 --> 00:30:47,970
you're dying.
you don't need it. i do.

449
00:30:48,004 --> 00:30:51,104
don't cry, zach.
it pisses me off.

450
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:54,237
well, you said all of this
was gonna be mine,

451
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:56,337
so when do i get it?!

452
00:30:56,371 --> 00:30:58,337
"empire" is
a highfalutin word,

453
00:30:58,371 --> 00:31:00,837
but that's what i've built.

454
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,237
unfortunately...

455
00:31:03,271 --> 00:31:08,903
an empire can only be ruled
by an iron fist

456
00:31:08,937 --> 00:31:12,070
and a strong gut.

457
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:15,170
i wanted to give it to you,
zach,

458
00:31:15,204 --> 00:31:18,237
but i'm starting to have
my doubts about you.

459
00:31:18,271 --> 00:31:22,271
so what?

460
00:31:22,304 --> 00:31:23,970
are you cutting me off?

461
00:31:24,004 --> 00:31:27,803
i don't have any use
for weakness.

462
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:32,371
get out.

463
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,170
what, are you gonna kill me?

464
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:21,504
prove you're a tough guy?

465
00:32:24,571 --> 00:32:26,704
see?
that's why i can't give you

466
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:28,738
the keys to the kingdom,
kid.

467
00:32:31,004 --> 00:32:33,471
no balls.

468
00:33:11,754 --> 00:33:16,587
 <i>we met gabrielle solis the day</i>
 <i>she moved to wisteria lane.</i>

469
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:19,087
 <i>we were all excited</i>
 <i>to get a glimpse</i>

470

 <i>than we bargained for.</i>

00:33:35,621 --> 00:33:37,987
this is susan,

478
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,953
welcome

479
00:33:39,987 --> 00:33:41,754
well, i am gabrielle solis.

480
00:33:41,788 --> 00:33:45,254
would it be better
if we came back at another time?

481
00:33:45,287 --> 00:33:47,621
oh! no, no. i was...

482
00:33:47,654 --> 00:33:50,287
just changing
out of my sweaty clothes.

483
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:53,754
i didn't realize
moving was such great cardio.

484
00:33:53,788 --> 00:33:58,120
hey, babe, we haven't tried it
in the kitchen yet.

485
00:34:00,254 --> 00:34:03,788
honey, uh, i think it's time
to unpack the pants.

486
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,587
right.

487
00:34:06,621 --> 00:34:08,621
it's nice to meet you ladies.

488
00:34:10,354 --> 00:34:13,220
let me guess--newlyweds?

489
00:34:13,254 --> 00:34:14,688
four months,

490
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:18,987
and i've dressed like this
for two of 'em. (laughs)

491
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,087
he's insatiable.

492
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,987
hey, what are you doing?

493
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,220
now?
babe, it's kind of late.

494
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:41,920
you don't wanna have sex
with me?

495
00:34:41,953 --> 00:34:43,987
you always wanna have sex
with me.

496
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,987
you wanted to have sex
with me

497
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,987
an hour
after your hernia operation.

498
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,421
i'm a little preoccupied.

499
00:34:50,454 --> 00:34:53,154
a good man died today.

500
00:34:53,187 --> 00:34:55,321
don't take it personally.

501
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,788
xiao-mei said
the strangest thing to me.

502
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,788
when i told her
you were dead,

503
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,321
she said,
"please don't kill him."

504
00:35:15,987 --> 00:35:18,487
that poor kid.

505
00:35:18,521 --> 00:35:22,654
oh. we really need to get her
some english lessons.

506
00:35:28,154 --> 00:35:33,220
(engine sputtering)

507
00:35:33,254 --> 00:35:35,920
julie,
what are you doing?

508
00:35:35,953 --> 00:35:37,688
i'm trying to sleep.

509
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:39,521
morning, ladies.

510
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,554
karl! what are you doing?

511
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:45,554
i've got a little surprise
planned for my girls.

512
00:35:45,587 --> 00:35:49,087
so just sit back and relax.
we'll be there shortly.

513
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:56,953
no, no, no, no.
no, turn my house around.

514
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:59,120
latte?

515
00:36:05,054 --> 00:36:07,054
(karl) out to the right,
ladies.

516
00:36:11,154 --> 00:36:12,654
my gift to you.

517
00:36:14,387 --> 00:36:16,054
you bought us a house?

518
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:19,354
let's have a look around.
there's three bedrooms,

519
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:21,354
a gourmet kitchen...
for what it's worth.

520
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,354
there's a guest house
in the back

521
00:36:23,387 --> 00:36:25,820
that you could use as a studio.
there's a pool.

522
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:27,321
a pool? really? aah!

523
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,688
what's the catch?

524
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,853
there's no catch.
it's yours, susie.

525
00:36:32,887 --> 00:36:36,287
yours and julie's,
no strings attached.

526
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:39,120
(sighs)
i can't accept this.

527
00:36:39,154 --> 00:36:41,953
i just--i gotta get out
of this mess on my own.

528
00:36:41,987 --> 00:36:44,020
this is not charity.

529
00:36:44,054 --> 00:36:45,987
i owe you...

530
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,487
for everything i've done
over the years,

531
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:51,920
for all the heartache
i've inflicted on you.

532
00:36:51,953 --> 00:36:53,820
consider it payback.

533
00:36:53,853 --> 00:36:56,587
mom!

534
00:36:56,621 --> 00:36:58,754
there's a pool <i>and</i> a jacuzzi!

535
00:36:58,788 --> 00:37:01,254
at least no one
can drive off with it

536
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:03,887
while you're sleeping, huh?

537
00:37:07,887 --> 00:37:09,387
 <i>hey, it's susan.</i>

538
00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:12,387
 <i>just wanted you to know i let</i>
 <i>the electrician in your house.</i>

539
00:37:12,421 --> 00:37:14,920
 <i>i hope you're having</i>
 <i>a great time at the spa.</i>

540
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:17,788
 <i>bree, hi. it's betty.</i>

541
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,287
 <i>i'm--i'm sorry to leave this</i>
 <i>on the machine,</i>

542
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,788
 <i>but the police have evidence</i>
 <i>that implicates matthew</i>

543
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,788
 <i>in the murder</i>
 <i>of melanie foster.</i>

544
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,788
 <i>we have to find them, bree.</i>

545
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,688
 <i>we have to find them</i>
 <i>and get danielle back.</i>

546
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:38,321
(bree) you let go of me
right now!
hey, hey!

547
00:37:38,354 --> 00:37:42,087
what's going on here?
i am trying to leave,
and these morons won't let me.

548
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,853
do you know that you can be
arrested for kidnapping,

549
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,521
for detaining someone?!
why do you need to leave?

550
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:50,454
because my daughter
is in danger.
something happened
at cheerleading camp.

551
00:37:50,487 --> 00:37:52,454
okay, there's no camp.
that was a fib on my part.

552
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:54,721
i found out that she ran away
with a boy,

553
00:37:54,754 --> 00:37:57,454
and the boy is a murderer.
a murderer?

554
00:37:57,487 --> 00:38:00,254
i can tell by your tone
that you don't believe me.

555
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:03,187
bree, let's talk about this
in my office.

556
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,054
i don't have time for therapy,
you quack!

557
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:07,554
now let me out of here!
let go of me!

558
00:38:07,587 --> 00:38:09,554
you idiot, let go of me!

559
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,554
you know tt i
committed myself voluntarily!

560
00:38:11,587 --> 00:38:14,120
you can't do this to me!
no!

561
00:38:14,154 --> 00:38:15,953
bree, please, don't struggle.

562
00:38:19,654 --> 00:38:22,621
if anything happens
to my daughter,

563
00:38:22,654 --> 00:38:24,120
so help me, god...

564
00:38:24,154 --> 00:38:27,454
we're only trying to help.

565
00:38:41,504 --> 00:38:45,270
mr. young, you'll need
to come up to the house

566
00:38:45,304 --> 00:38:47,270
to sign
some legal documents.

567
00:38:47,304 --> 00:38:48,637
what for?

568
00:38:48,637 --> 00:38:51,170
noah taylor's will called
for an immediate transference

569
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:53,904
of his entire estate to you
upon his death.

570
00:38:56,971 --> 00:38:58,938
so everything's mine?

571
00:38:58,971 --> 00:39:00,704
that's correct.

572
00:39:08,454 --> 00:39:09,754
hi, dad.

573
00:39:09,787 --> 00:39:12,754
(paul) so, did you have
any luck with your grandfather?

574
00:39:12,787 --> 00:39:14,754
yeah, i talked to noah.

575
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:16,754
he's not gonna give us
the money.

576
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,253
damn it, zach!
sorry?

577
00:39:18,287 --> 00:39:20,253
go back and talk to him.

578
00:39:20,287 --> 00:39:22,754
no, i-i don't think
he's gonna change his mind.

579
00:39:22,787 --> 00:39:24,754
terrific.
am i gonna see you tomorrow?

580
00:39:24,787 --> 00:39:26,787
no, i-i can't come tomorrow.

581
00:39:26,821 --> 00:39:28,287
what about monday?

582
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,287
uh, next week's bad for me,
too.

583
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,854
i'll--i'll call you
when i know.
zach? zach!

584
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:35,188
is there anything i can do?

585
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,921
yeah, get me a new phone
with a different number.

586
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,088
and fill in
this stupid lake.

587
00:40:07,253 --> 00:40:08,721
careful with those.

588
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:11,387
the last of the crystal.
okay.

589
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,587
hey, what's going on?

590
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,021
oh, hi.
um, we're just moving.

591
00:40:16,054 --> 00:40:18,054
hey! it's the plumber.

592
00:40:18,088 --> 00:40:21,587
you come over to help susie
move into her new house?

593
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,954
new house?

594
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:26,021
oh, she didn't tell you?
i bought a place for my girls.

595
00:40:26,054 --> 00:40:28,021
you let him buy you
a house?

596
00:40:28,054 --> 00:40:29,954
uh, well,
he's not moving in with us.

597
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:32,587
after that speech about
wanting to go it alone,

598
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,554
and after i offered
to let you stay with me?

599
00:40:35,587 --> 00:40:38,054
to be fair,
you just had a spare room,

600
00:40:38,088 --> 00:40:39,787
and this is a whole house.

601
00:40:39,821 --> 00:40:41,287
(chuckles) hey, no offense,

602
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,420
if you're not using your back,
you're just in the way.

603
00:40:44,454 --> 00:40:46,721
you saw me
buying that ring,

604
00:40:46,754 --> 00:40:48,854
and you just had
to cut me off.

605
00:40:48,887 --> 00:40:50,887
you bought me a ring?

606
00:40:50,921 --> 00:40:52,854
suze, let me handle this.

607
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:55,287
a man's gotta protect
his family.

608
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,921
uh, mike, about that ring...
put that box down.

609
00:40:57,954 --> 00:41:01,088
what, you gonna hit me,
huh?

610
00:41:01,121 --> 00:41:02,754
(susan) stop it! oh, my...

611
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:07,054
what are you--
just stop it! oh, that's enough!

612
00:41:07,088 --> 00:41:11,420
just get off! get off! go! go!
oh, my god.

613
00:41:11,454 --> 00:41:14,654
what? stop! that's enough.
enough, enough. back up.

614
00:41:14,687 --> 00:41:19,054
and that ring--
that was for me, right?
not now.

615
00:41:19,088 --> 00:41:20,921
(susan) oh, my...

616
00:41:20,954 --> 00:41:22,454
ohh!

617
00:41:22,487 --> 00:41:25,620
karl, are you okay?

618
00:41:25,654 --> 00:41:27,987
are you okay? let me see.

619
00:41:28,021 --> 00:41:30,188
oh, my god.

620
00:41:32,188 --> 00:41:33,887
whew.

621
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:36,620
(susan) can you sit up?

622
00:41:42,188 --> 00:41:44,188
(karl) whew.

623
00:41:46,854 --> 00:41:49,620
xiao-mei,
do you have a second?

624
00:41:49,654 --> 00:41:52,620
this is probably silly,
but it's been bothering me.

625
00:41:52,654 --> 00:41:54,854
when you said,
"please don't kill him,"

626
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,353
did you mean carlos?

627
00:41:56,387 --> 00:42:00,121
ralph dead, not mr. solis.

628
00:42:00,154 --> 00:42:03,987
i know. it's just,
you said "kill," not "dead."

629
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:07,154
and i'd have to do be
pretty angry to kill someone,

630
00:42:07,188 --> 00:42:09,154
so i guess my question is,

631
00:42:09,188 --> 00:42:12,121
do i have a reason
to be angry at mr. solis?

632
00:42:14,387 --> 00:42:16,954
please, so much laundry.

633
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,520
xiao-mei...

634
00:42:24,353 --> 00:42:27,520
how did you rip
your panties?

635
00:42:31,887 --> 00:42:34,420
i fall down.

636
00:42:36,188 --> 00:42:38,654
says here dr. bader
examined xiao-mei last week,

637
00:42:38,687 --> 00:42:40,787
and everything was fine.

638
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:42,287
yeah, i know.

639
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,787
it's just, she's been
having pain... down there.

640
00:42:44,821 --> 00:42:46,821
so if you couldtake a

641
00:42:46,854 --> 00:42:48,821
it'd make me feel
so much better.

642
00:42:48,854 --> 00:42:49,821
of course.

643
00:42:49,854 --> 00:42:51,821
(lowers voice)
um, and, doctor, uh,

644
00:42:51,854 --> 00:42:53,320
while you're down there,

645
00:42:53,353 --> 00:42:55,320
could you check
if she's still a virgin?

646
00:42:55,353 --> 00:42:57,253
i'm sorry?

647
00:42:57,287 --> 00:42:59,487
you don't even have
to say it out loud.

648
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,154
if you see hymen,
just give me a thumbs up.

649
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:35,021
(boys speaking indistinctly)

650
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,787
what's this now?

651
00:43:44,821 --> 00:43:46,287
i wanna swim.

652
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,787
well, we already swam.
now it's time to pack.

653
00:43:48,821 --> 00:43:51,954
hey, hey, hey!
what's going on?

654
00:43:51,987 --> 00:43:54,088
dad would let me swim.

655
00:43:54,121 --> 00:43:56,088
(sighs)
well, dad's not here,

656
00:43:56,121 --> 00:44:00,287
so i decide,
and i decide no.

657
00:44:03,987 --> 00:44:05,954
oh, porter,
what are you doing?

658
00:44:05,987 --> 00:44:07,154
hey!

659
00:44:07,188 --> 00:44:09,754
hey, get down off that
right now. i mean it!

660
00:44:09,787 --> 00:44:12,420
okay! okay, okay, porter,
just stop, all right?

661
00:44:12,454 --> 00:44:15,687
just come on inside, and we'll
forget the whole thing.

662
00:44:15,721 --> 00:44:17,954
aah!
aah! no!

663
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,721
(both) daddy!

664
00:44:27,754 --> 00:44:29,121
daddy!
daddy!

665
00:44:29,154 --> 00:44:33,921
hey, guys. god! ooh, god,
i've missed you so much.

666
00:44:33,954 --> 00:44:36,487
oh, you, too, munchkin.

667
00:44:41,253 --> 00:44:43,220
where's porter?
is he okay?

668
00:44:43,253 --> 00:44:45,887
he broke his arm.
they took him up to x-ray.

669
00:44:45,921 --> 00:44:49,821
hey, guys, why don't you look
after your sister for me, okay?

670
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,854
mommy and daddy
need to talk.

671
00:44:54,353 --> 00:44:56,821
i've got nothing to say
to you.

672
00:44:56,854 --> 00:44:58,821
i just called
because i had to.

673
00:44:58,854 --> 00:45:00,854
honey, whatever you saw,
i can explain it.

674
00:45:00,887 --> 00:45:02,353
i am not interested,

675
00:45:02,387 --> 00:45:04,353
and if you wanna
keep those fingers,

676
00:45:04,387 --> 00:45:06,887
i would move 'em awayfrom my b

677
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,487
lynette,
i am not cheating on you.

678
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,088
i never have,
and i never will.

679
00:45:13,121 --> 00:45:15,554
i saw you
with that woman.

680
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:18,554
her name is nora.
i met her 12 years ago.
i don't care
what her name is.

681
00:45:18,587 --> 00:45:21,654
i met her before you. she was
a dancer on a cruise ship.

682
00:45:21,687 --> 00:45:23,520
we had a one night stand.

683
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,253
i haven't thought about her
in years.
then why are you
going to atlantic city

684
00:45:26,287 --> 00:45:29,687
every other weekend
to visit her? (sighs)

685
00:45:29,721 --> 00:45:33,887
i have another child,
lynette.

686
00:45:33,921 --> 00:45:36,620
what?

687
00:45:36,654 --> 00:45:38,787
she got pregnant
from the one night stand.

688
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:41,121
nora raised the kid
without ever telling me.

689
00:45:41,154 --> 00:45:43,121
i only just fo jd out
about it.

690
00:45:43,154 --> 00:45:45,554
that is why i have been
going back and forth.

691
00:45:45,587 --> 00:45:47,554
i am not having an affair.

692
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,220
uhh!

693
00:46:03,154 --> 00:46:05,121
the little girl's name
is kayla.

694
00:46:05,154 --> 00:46:07,420
she's 11 years old.

695
00:46:07,454 --> 00:46:10,387
i know i should've told you
about this sooner.

696
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,387
it's just that i wanted to take
a paternity test to be sure,

697
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,520
and i'm definitely the dad.

698
00:46:18,854 --> 00:46:21,620
why did she wait so long
to contact you?

699
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:24,121
she said she wanted
to raise the kid alone,

700
00:46:24,154 --> 00:46:28,420
and i... i guess
she's changed her mind, hoy.

701
00:46:28,454 --> 00:46:32,420
baby, i am so sorry.

702
00:46:32,454 --> 00:46:34,420
noready for that yet.

703
00:46:34,454 --> 00:46:35,787
okay.

704
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,954
you have no idea how badly
you scared me.

705
00:46:42,787 --> 00:46:44,253
i am so sorry.

706
00:46:44,287 --> 00:46:46,921
i had already let you go.

707
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,088
dad! i got a blue cast.

708
00:46:55,121 --> 00:46:59,021
hey, buddy. you sure did.
that's pretty cool.

709
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,587
hey.

710
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:09,687
it itches.
can we go home now?

711
00:47:17,487 --> 00:47:20,287
yeah. we're going home.

712
00:47:30,903 --> 00:47:32,804
have they rung up
your prescription yet?

713
00:47:32,838 --> 00:47:34,838
no, they're getting it
right now.

714
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:36,337
good. add that on.

715
00:47:36,371 --> 00:47:38,838
you're dying your hair
honey wheat blond?

716
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:40,970
oh, it's not for me.

717
00:47:41,003 --> 00:47:43,870
it's for danielle.

718
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:47,304
that hair is going back
to the color god intended.

719
00:47:47,337 --> 00:47:49,571
you actually think
she's gonna sit still

720
00:47:49,604 --> 00:47:51,571
as you towel this
through her hair?

721
00:47:51,604 --> 00:47:54,070
oh, i will tie h down
if necessary.

722
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:56,671
i'm also thinking of checking
her body for piercings

723
00:47:56,704 --> 00:47:58,337
while i'm at it.
you're overreacting.

724
00:47:58,371 --> 00:48:00,371
she's just going through
a phase.

725
00:48:00,404 --> 00:48:02,371
that's what
girls her age do.

726
00:48:02,404 --> 00:48:04,903
they also get pregnant
and become drug addicts.

727
00:48:04,937 --> 00:48:07,671
and that color hair
is the gateway.

728
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:12,170
would you please, uh,
add that to our bill?

729
00:48:12,204 --> 00:48:13,671
i'm telling you, bree,

730
00:48:13,704 --> 00:48:15,704
you're gonna have to
stop riding 'em so hard.

731
00:48:15,738 --> 00:48:19,604
i am trying to ensure that they
turn into responsible adults.

732
00:48:19,637 --> 00:48:22,104
trust me, rex,
in the end,

733
00:48:22,137 --> 00:48:24,070
we will be rewarded.

734
00:48:24,104 --> 00:48:26,671
how can you be so damn sure
of yourself all the time?

735
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:28,604
why is my certainty a flaw?

736
00:48:28,637 --> 00:48:31,104
i know what i'm about,
i know my values,

737
00:48:31,137 --> 00:48:32,771
and i know what's right.

738
00:48:32,804 --> 00:48:34,771
why shouldn't i stay
the course?

739
00:48:34,804 --> 00:48:37,337
am i right,
mr. williams?

740
00:48:37,371 --> 00:48:39,937
my mother always took
a firm hand with me,

741
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:41,937
and i thank her for it.

742
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:44,903
exactly, and look how well
you turned out.

743
00:48:44,937 --> 00:48:46,704
(chuckles)

744
00:48:48,204 --> 00:48:51,404
look, you're a good mother,
but there's a limit.

745
00:48:51,437 --> 00:48:53,903
you have got to relinquish
some control,

746
00:48:53,937 --> 00:48:55,937
or else
you're gonna regret it.

747
00:49:13,804 --> 00:49:16,937
excuse me.
do you have the time?

748
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:20,137
yeah, it's just after 8:00.
oh, i was afraid of that.

749
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:21,604
afraid of what?

750
00:49:21,637 --> 00:49:24,604
well, i'm only supposed
to be restrained until 7:00.

751
00:49:24,637 --> 00:49:26,970
you see, i have a problem
with sleepwalking.

752
00:49:27,003 --> 00:49:29,371
they just tie me up
so that i don't wander off

753
00:49:29,404 --> 00:49:30,870
and hurt myself.

754
00:49:30,903 --> 00:49:33,771
yeah, well, i'm sure a nurse
will be in here soon.

755
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,270
one can only hope.

756
00:49:35,304 --> 00:49:37,704
of course, if a doctor
gets here first

757
00:49:37,738 --> 00:49:41,270
and sees that someone
forgot to release me,

758
00:49:41,304 --> 00:49:43,937
i'm sure they'd get
in a lot of trouble.

759
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:46,604
lady, i can't let you
out of your restraints.

760
00:49:46,637 --> 00:49:48,104
i'd get fired.

761
00:49:48,137 --> 00:49:50,870
oh. well, i certainly would not
want that to happen.

762
00:49:54,937 --> 00:49:56,404
what's your name?

763
00:49:56,437 --> 00:49:57,637
alfred.

764
00:49:57,671 --> 00:49:59,571
oh! does anybody ever
call you "alfie"?

765
00:49:59,604 --> 00:50:01,170
no.

766
00:50:01,204 --> 00:50:04,571
and why should they?

767
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:08,903
so, um, alfred,

768
00:50:08,937 --> 00:50:12,437
i was wondering if you could
maybe loosen my restraints.

769
00:50:12,471 --> 00:50:14,237
they're incredibly tight,

770
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:16,738
and i'm sure
there are no rules

771
00:50:16,771 --> 00:50:18,771
against making me
more comfortable.

772
00:50:23,738 --> 00:50:26,270
do you think i'm stupid?

773
00:50:26,304 --> 00:50:28,003
i beg your pardon?

774
00:50:28,037 --> 00:50:30,504
two seconds after i loosen
these little restraints,

775
00:50:30,537 --> 00:50:32,604
you'll try to scratch
my eyes out

776
00:50:32,637 --> 00:50:34,337
and make a run for it.

777
00:50:34,371 --> 00:50:37,104
well, i'm not falling for it,
you psycho little bitch.

778
00:50:37,137 --> 00:50:39,537
in fact, i hope they keep you
tied up for the next month.

779
00:50:39,571 --> 00:50:42,037
'cause i'd get a real kick
out of watching

780
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:44,037
a prissy little whack job
like you

781
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:46,037
lying in your own filth.

782
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:47,571
know what i mean?

783
00:50:51,704 --> 00:50:53,704
oh. are you all right?

784
00:50:53,738 --> 00:50:58,070
uh, yeah. a little hopped up
on pain medicine, but, um,

785
00:50:58,104 --> 00:51:00,571
i chipped my tooth
on the salad shooter.

786
00:51:00,604 --> 00:51:02,571
oh. oh, you know,
you should, um,

787
00:51:02,604 --> 00:51:04,738
call my friend orson.

788
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:06,237
he's a dentist.

789
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:09,204
i'm sure he'll see you
right away.
thanks.

790
00:51:09,237 --> 00:51:11,371
so...

791
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:14,037
about that ring you bought--

792
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:17,804
is there anything particular
you'd like to ask me?

793
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:19,970
nope,
not as long karl's got you

794
00:51:20,003 --> 00:51:21,471
wrapped around his finger.

795
00:51:21,504 --> 00:51:23,137
okay, that's ridiculous.

796
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:25,504
karl doesn't have me
wrapped around anything.

797
00:51:25,537 --> 00:51:28,738
you accepted a house from him,
and you're nuts if you believe

798
00:51:28,771 --> 00:51:30,738
he doesn't have
an ulterior motive.

799
00:51:30,771 --> 00:51:32,738
he's karl.
he's playing me.

800
00:51:32,771 --> 00:51:35,237
but that house is gonna be
a great place

801
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:37,771
for my daughter to live.

802
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:39,771
and when he makes his move,

803
00:51:39,804 --> 00:51:43,704
he's gonna realize that
 <i>i</i> was really playing <i>him.</i>

804
00:51:43,738 --> 00:51:47,371
so... about that ring...

805
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,838
i... i just don't want
to get deeper into this

806
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:52,337
and suddenly realize
your heart's somewhere else.

807
00:51:52,371 --> 00:51:57,070
mike, my heart is
in the exact right place.

808
00:51:57,104 --> 00:51:59,371
ugh. i can't have hthis c

809
00:51:59,404 --> 00:52:01,771
now my tooth is throbbing.

810
00:52:01,804 --> 00:52:04,471
of course.

811
00:52:04,504 --> 00:52:06,003
okay.

812
00:52:07,804 --> 00:52:11,204
you don't even wanna know
what my answer would have been?

813
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,771
can we please
get out of here?

814
00:52:22,804 --> 00:52:24,270
this place is gross.

815
00:52:24,304 --> 00:52:26,237
and, god, i'm starving.

816
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:28,671
yeah, i know, but we don't
have any money, remember?

817
00:52:28,704 --> 00:52:30,671
that's why we should
go to my house.

818
00:52:30,704 --> 00:52:32,704
i know the combination
to my mom's safe.

819
00:52:32,738 --> 00:52:34,738
okay, i've told you
a thousand times,

820
00:52:34,771 --> 00:52:37,237
it's way too risky. no.
something you should know
before we embark

821
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:38,738
on this little adventure--

822
00:52:38,771 --> 00:52:41,237
i can get pretty bitchy
when i'm not fed.

823
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:44,070
(tv turns off)

824
00:52:47,471 --> 00:52:49,604
listen, i hope
i'm not out of line here,

825
00:52:49,637 --> 00:52:52,404
but did you ever spend
any time in prison?

826
00:52:52,437 --> 00:52:55,204
, you can tell
from my teeth?

827
00:52:55,237 --> 00:52:59,003
jailhouse dentistry--
unmistakable and not pretty.

828
00:52:59,037 --> 00:53:02,003
yeah, i did a little time
in kansas a few years back.

829
00:53:02,037 --> 00:53:04,003
were you a prison dentist?

830
00:53:04,037 --> 00:53:07,804
uh, during dental school,
we did freebie work

831
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:10,738
on some of the poor guinea pigs
behind bars. no offense.

832
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:13,738
you know, i had the feeling
when i first saw you

833
00:53:13,771 --> 00:53:16,604
in the movie theater
that we'd met before.
i don't think so.

834
00:53:16,637 --> 00:53:19,104
oh, i'm pretty sure.
i think i know you.

835
00:53:19,137 --> 00:53:21,903
any chance i was
one of your guinea pigs?

836
00:53:21,937 --> 00:53:25,571
no. the only prison work
i did was back in virginia.

837
00:53:28,504 --> 00:53:31,037
diploma says you graduated
from minnesota.

838
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:34,970
i'm licensed
in three states.

839
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,537
open wide, please.

840
00:53:37,571 --> 00:53:40,903
don't talk.
i wouldn't want to hurt you.

841
00:53:46,904 --> 00:53:49,603
carlos, you promised
you'd come home today.

842
00:53:49,637 --> 00:53:51,904
well, i don't care
what tanaka wants!

843
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,371
rattling around
this stupid house all by myself

844
00:53:54,404 --> 00:53:56,371
is not what i signed up r!

845
00:53:56,404 --> 00:54:00,137
no, no, no, don't hang up on me.
i'm not done yelling at you!

846
00:54:25,171 --> 00:54:27,804
mrs. solis.

847
00:54:27,837 --> 00:54:29,304
how are you?

848
00:54:29,337 --> 00:54:32,271
the best you've ever had.

849
00:54:43,504 --> 00:54:45,937
what's so funny?

850
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:48,438
me and my friend justin
had this bet.

851
00:54:48,471 --> 00:54:50,471
see who could lose
their virginity first

852
00:54:50,504 --> 00:54:52,471
this summer at bible camp.

853
00:54:52,504 --> 00:54:54,937
guess i beat him
to the punch.

854
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:58,137
you were a virgin?

855
00:54:58,171 --> 00:55:00,438
so it didn't show?

856
00:55:00,471 --> 00:55:02,204
uh, no.

857
00:55:02,237 --> 00:55:04,703
no, i mean, i guess it was,
well, weird when

858
00:55:04,737 --> 00:55:07,937
you started naming the american
presidents in order.

859
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:10,037
ah, i wish you hadn't
heard that.

860
00:55:10,071 --> 00:55:12,037
i was just trying to...

861
00:55:12,071 --> 00:55:14,703
no, no, you were good.

862
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:19,570
just, if it comes up in school,
paul revere was never president.

863
00:55:19,603 --> 00:55:23,237
oh. thanks.

864
00:55:23,271 --> 00:55:27,237
i, uh, had a really
awesome time, mrs. solis.

865
00:55:27,271 --> 00:55:29,071
well, good. i'm glad,

866
00:55:29,104 --> 00:55:31,304
because this can
never happen again.

867
00:55:31,337 --> 00:55:32,304
why?

868
00:55:32,337 --> 00:55:34,104
the only reason i did this

869
00:55:34,137 --> 00:55:36,271
was because i was angry
at carlos.

870
00:55:36,304 --> 00:55:38,970
now, thanks to you,
i'm not angry anymore.

871
00:55:39,004 --> 00:55:41,637
well, you should be.
i mean, the guy's never around.

872
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:44,304
hell, he's probably off having
his own affair right now.

873
00:55:44,337 --> 00:55:47,504
oh. (chuckles)
i seriously doubt that.

874
00:55:47,538 --> 00:55:49,504
how do you know?

875
00:55:49,538 --> 00:55:52,504
because carlos doesn't have
an adulterous bone in his body.

876
00:55:52,538 --> 00:55:54,504
what we just did
he could never do.

877
00:55:54,538 --> 00:55:59,937
for him, sex isn't just sex.
it's a sign of intimacy.

878
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:03,071
it's the way he shows love.

879
00:56:03,104 --> 00:56:06,703
you know, instead of
talking and listening

880
00:56:06,737 --> 00:56:09,504
and spending time with me.

881
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:15,670
what was that for?

882
00:56:15,703 --> 00:56:18,471
thought you needed a kiss.

883
00:56:20,937 --> 00:56:23,837
well, since this is
our last time,

884
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:26,337
i guess we can make
the most of it.

885
00:56:32,271 --> 00:56:36,404
so... you really trust him,
huh?

886
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:37,937
completely.

887
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:41,670
 <i>like all good mothers,</i>

888
00:56:41,703 --> 00:56:47,271
 <i>gabrielle had purchased several</i>
 <i>top-of-the-line baby monitors.</i>

889
00:56:47,304 --> 00:56:50,404
 <i>she had planned to use them</i>
 <i>to keep a close watch</i>

890
00:56:50,438 --> 00:56:53,037
 <i>on her newborn child.</i>

891
00:56:53,071 --> 00:56:57,603
 <i>that plan was about to change.</i>

892
00:57:03,603 --> 00:57:05,570
so i'm gonna go shopping

893
00:57:05,603 --> 00:57:07,371
and then i'm gonna see
my trainer,

894
00:57:07,404 --> 00:57:09,870
and i'll definitely be gone
for, like, three hours.

895
00:57:13,104 --> 00:57:16,004
okay. well, i gotta go.
have fun.

896
00:57:24,703 --> 00:57:26,171
 <i>(lynette) not later, penny.</i>

897
00:57:26,204 --> 00:57:28,837
 <i>mommy's gotta change you now</i>

899
00:57:36,004 --> 00:57:37,670

00:57:37,703 --> 00:57:39,570

 <i>oh, yeah.</i>

00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:48,004
 <i>it's okay. mu shu pork</i>
 <i>supposed to be messy.</i>

904
00:57:48,037 --> 00:57:50,004
 <i>i wish gabrielle could</i>
 <i>cook like this.</i>

905
00:57:50,037 --> 00:57:52,004
 <i>have you ever tried</i>
 <i>her enchiladas?</i>

906
00:57:52,037 --> 00:57:55,204
 <i>one time</i>
 <i>they make me sick.</i>

907
00:58:03,904 --> 00:58:05,904
ugh. he will,
and he'll meet you

908
00:58:05,937 --> 00:58:08,371
for a romantic
motor home rendezvous,

909
00:58:08,404 --> 00:58:10,371
and you'll propose,
he'll accept,

910
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,904
and you'll both live
happily ever after.

911
00:58:12,937 --> 00:58:15,337
you really think
that's what's gonna happen?

912
00:58:15,371 --> 00:58:17,438
it's my deepest hope.

913
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,770
oh, there he is.

914
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,637
we're in.

915
00:58:49,954 --> 00:58:51,920
POLLY? THAT'S A GOOD NAME.

916
00:58:51,954 --> 00:58:53,254
NO WAY.

917
00:58:53,287 --> 00:58:54,254
PAMELA.

918
00:58:54,277 --> 00:58:56,244
i said i wanted penny.

919
00:58:56,277 --> 00:58:57,244
oh, lynette...

920
00:58:57,277 --> 00:59:00,144
eight hours
of grueling labor.

921
00:59:00,177 --> 00:59:01,643
that's not fair.

922
00:59:01,677 --> 00:59:04,144
neither are stretch marks,
but what are you gonna do?

923
00:59:04,177 --> 00:59:07,177
i've only known one penny
in my whole life,

924
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:09,444
and she was a slut.
isn't your aunt named penny?

925
00:59:09,478 --> 00:59:11,111
yeah, that's her.

926
00:59:11,144 --> 00:59:14,643
our daughter
is officially named.

927
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:16,177
you may go now.

928
00:59:16,211 --> 00:59:18,877
all right,
i'll let you win this one,

929
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:21,377
but i get to name
the next one.

930
00:59:21,411 --> 00:59:24,478
you promised me
we'd stop at four.

931
00:59:24,511 --> 00:59:26,478
remember?
you wanted four kids,

932
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:30,044
i wanted one, and somehow
we compromised on four.

933
00:59:30,077 --> 00:59:32,044
can we please stop now?

934
00:59:32,077 --> 00:59:33,710
lynette, you're hurting me.

935
00:59:33,743 --> 00:59:36,544
i will stop
as soon as you promise.

936
00:59:36,578 --> 00:59:38,844
okay, i promise.

937
00:59:38,877 --> 00:59:41,478
okay.

938
00:59:43,544 --> 00:59:45,977
honey, i...
i didn't mean to upset ya.

939
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:47,211
it's just...

940
00:59:47,244 --> 00:59:48,810
we've been so happy.

941
00:59:48,844 --> 00:59:50,844
sweetie, sometimes when
you're at work,

942
00:59:50,877 --> 00:59:53,344
and i'm home alone
with three young boys,

943
00:59:53,377 --> 00:59:55,377
i'm not so happy,

944
00:59:55,411 --> 00:59:58,411
and now i'm gonna be alone
with four kids.

945
00:59:58,444 --> 01:00:00,977
each one is a blessing,
yes,

946
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:05,777
but i don't think i can
take any more... blessings.

947
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:09,344
more blessings could make me
lose my mind.

948
01:00:09,377 --> 01:00:11,111
do you understand?

949
01:00:11,144 --> 01:00:12,511
yeah.

950
01:00:12,544 --> 01:00:14,844
thank you.

951
01:00:16,777 --> 01:00:19,111
honey, that really hurt.

952
01:00:19,144 --> 01:00:21,177
did it hurt for eight hours?

953
01:00:21,211 --> 01:00:22,977
no.

954
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:24,743
okay, then.

955
01:00:31,311 --> 01:00:33,777
i must have been crazy,
agreeing to this.

956
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:35,777
honey, you're gonna feel
differently

957
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:37,277
once you meet kayla.

958
01:00:37,311 --> 01:00:39,277
she is sweet,
smart little girl,

959
01:00:39,311 --> 01:00:42,277
plus it'll help you get past
your resentment of nora.

960
01:00:42,311 --> 01:00:43,311
i don't...

961
01:00:43,344 --> 01:00:45,211
well, here goes.

962
01:00:49,643 --> 01:00:51,077
hey, you!

963
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:07,311
you must be lynette.
and you must be nora.

964
01:01:07,344 --> 01:01:09,311
i guess it'd be weird
if we hugged.

965
01:01:09,344 --> 01:01:11,677
probably.

966
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,810
wh-where's kayla?

967
01:01:13,844 --> 01:01:15,277
oh, she didn't come.

968
01:01:15,311 --> 01:01:17,844
we got into this huge fight,
and i was, like...

969
01:01:17,877 --> 01:01:20,311
i just couldn't stand
to look at her face

970
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:23,311
on that long plane trip, so i
dumped her at the neighbors'.

971
01:01:23,344 --> 01:01:25,444
but, hey, come on,
you got me.

972
01:01:34,844 --> 01:01:37,211
so, anyway,
kayla is doing great.

973
01:01:37,244 --> 01:01:39,877
she's so pretty.
she's so smart.

974
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:42,977
she's practically a star
on her soccer team.

975
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:45,044
i have the cutest picture.

976
01:01:45,077 --> 01:01:47,044
you know,
we wouldn't need a picture

977
01:01:47,077 --> 01:01:50,077
if you had actually
brought her like you promised.

978
01:01:51,344 --> 01:01:53,444
oh, gosh, i'm sorry.

979
01:01:53,478 --> 01:01:55,944
you know, but i just
haven't had much time

980
01:01:55,977 --> 01:01:58,643
to get away on my own since,
, i've been taking care

981
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:01,144
of your kid for
the past 11 years, super dad.

982
01:02:01,177 --> 01:02:03,177
okay, sorry, sorry,sorry, s

983
01:02:03,211 --> 01:02:06,511
i know it's been hard.
you've done an amazing job.

984
01:02:06,544 --> 01:02:09,411
thank you. i think, so, too.
apology accepted.

985
01:02:09,444 --> 01:02:11,743
anyway, i wasn't sure
that i wanted kayla here

986
01:02:11,777 --> 01:02:13,810
if we were gonna talk
about business.

987
01:02:15,944 --> 01:02:17,344
business?

988
01:02:17,377 --> 01:02:22,244
i was hoping that we could
talk about child support

989
01:02:22,277 --> 01:02:25,743
since i've got, like,
11 years coming to me, right?

990
01:02:25,777 --> 01:02:27,810
you never told me
i had a daughter.

991
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,377
my lawyer thinks
that i have a very good case.

992
01:02:30,411 --> 01:02:32,877
we can't afford this.
we have four kids.

993
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:35,977
tom just lost his job.
that'd bankrupt us.

994
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:38,511
i'm the bad guy now
when he's the one

995
01:02:38,544 --> 01:02:41,444
that knocked me up
and abandoned his child?

996
01:02:41,478 --> 01:02:44,677
how could he abandon her if
he didn't even know she existed?

997
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:46,844
that doesn't let him
off the hook.

998
01:02:46,877 --> 01:02:49,610
you know, you better do right
by me unless, of course,

999
01:02:49,643 --> 01:02:51,610
you wanna be known
as mrs. deadbeat dad!

1000
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:53,710
(lowers voice)
just take it easy.

1001
01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:59,444
are we just gonna keep
talking louder?

1002
01:02:59,478 --> 01:03:00,777
is that the plan?

1003
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,777
you wanna just keep
raising your voice

1004
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:04,910
'cause that's how you get
what you want, right

1005
01:03:04,944 --> 01:03:06,677
you make a scene,
you throw a tantrum,

1006
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:08,677
and everyone gets scared
and backs off.

1007
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:10,277
well, i don't work that way,
lady.

1008
01:03:10,311 --> 01:03:12,777
i don't care that my husband
was so phenomenally stupid

1009
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:14,578
and/or drunk to actually
have sex with you.

1010
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:17,044
i'm not gonna let it ruin
my life.

1011
01:03:17,077 --> 01:03:19,044
(loudly)
am i talking loud enough

1012
01:03:19,077 --> 01:03:21,777
for that to get through to you?

1013
01:03:25,344 --> 01:03:28,610
i'm just gonna pay
the bill.

1014
01:03:31,077 --> 01:03:33,044
karl, we've been through
a lot together.

1015
01:03:33,077 --> 01:03:35,478
we will always be connected
by julie,

1016
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:38,010
but... i know why
you bought me that house,

1017
01:03:38,044 --> 01:03:40,010
and i'm not momoving into it.

1018
01:03:40,044 --> 01:03:41,844
susie, come on, i--

1019
01:03:41,877 --> 01:03:43,810
carl, we are not
getting back together.

1020
01:03:43,844 --> 01:03:49,643
not ever. you need to just stop
and realize that it's over.

1021
01:03:49,677 --> 01:03:51,511
i'm gonna marry mike.

1022
01:03:51,544 --> 01:03:54,710
so i need you
to sign these

1023
01:03:54,743 --> 01:03:57,411
because i have to be
divorced first.

1024
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:00,643
mike popped the question

1025
01:04:00,677 --> 01:04:03,444
no. he was going to, but then
you clocked him in the mouth

1026
01:04:03,478 --> 01:04:05,777
with a salad shooter,
remember?

1027
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:09,478
actually, i'm going to pop
the question to him

1028
01:04:09,511 --> 01:04:11,177
tomorrow night.

1029
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,211
guess it cuts down
on the suspense

1030
01:04:15,244 --> 01:04:17,244
knowing he bought you
a ring.

1031
01:04:17,277 --> 01:04:22,511
you would think so,
but, no, it doesn't.

1032
01:04:22,544 --> 01:04:24,910
this is a lot to ask

1033
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,411
for a man
who still loves you, susie.

1034
01:04:27,444 --> 01:04:29,844
i know.

1035
01:04:29,877 --> 01:04:33,777
but if you really do...
love me,

1036
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:35,478
you'll let me go.

1037
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:44,377
okay, susie.
i can do that.

1038
01:04:46,311 --> 01:04:49,277
well, you know where to find me
if it doesn't work out.

1039
01:04:49,311 --> 01:04:51,877
oh, shut up.

1040
01:04:54,177 --> 01:04:56,643
i don't see another way
to make this work.

1041
01:04:56,677 --> 01:04:58,643
we've gotta p
into the pensions.

1042
01:04:58,677 --> 01:05:00,643
oh, i don't like
the sound of that.

1043
01:05:00,677 --> 01:05:02,877
well, it's that
or the kids' college fund.

1044
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:04,944
we'll write nora
one big check,

1045
01:05:04,977 --> 01:05:07,444
and in return,
she'll sign away her claim

1046
01:05:07,478 --> 01:05:09,444
for the back child support.

1047
01:05:09,478 --> 01:05:12,411
if we're lucky, she'll take
the bird in the hand.

1048
01:05:12,444 --> 01:05:14,511
okay, what are we
talkg about? how much?

1049
01:05:14,544 --> 01:05:17,910
well, we need to show her
we're serious.

1050
01:05:17,944 --> 01:05:19,478
$30,000?

1051
01:05:19,511 --> 01:05:21,743
are you kidding? $30,000?
if she takes you to court,

1052
01:05:21,777 --> 01:05:23,777
we'll lose
d end up paying

1053
01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:25,710
11 years of child support
all at once.

1054
01:05:25,743 --> 01:05:27,710
we could lose the house.

1055
01:05:27,743 --> 01:05:30,877
oh, we are screwed.
we are just plain screwed.
tom!

1056
01:05:32,743 --> 01:05:35,710
i am trying very hard
to be strong right now,

1057
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:38,211
and you melting down
is not helping me.

1058
01:05:38,244 --> 01:05:41,111
i'm sorry.

1059
01:05:41,144 --> 01:05:44,111
i know we're using up
a huge chunk of our savings,

1060
01:05:44,144 --> 01:05:47,244
but if it keeps that crazy woman
out of our life,

1061
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:50,010
it is the best money
we have ever spent.

1062
01:05:50,044 --> 01:05:52,977
we will be okay.

1063
01:05:54,444 --> 01:05:57,377
hey there.

1064
01:05:57,411 --> 01:05:59,977
i was surprised to hear
you wanted a session.

1065
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:02,478
well, there's nothing like
being tied to a bed

1066
01:06:02,511 --> 01:06:05,077
to change a girl's mind.

1067
01:06:05,111 --> 01:06:07,944
what do you wanna
talk about?

1068
01:06:07,977 --> 01:06:09,444
anything at all.

1069
01:06:09,478 --> 01:06:13,544
as you said, i...
i have a lot of issues.

1070
01:06:13,578 --> 01:06:15,478
well, i assumed as much

1071
01:06:15,511 --> 01:06:17,478
when you told
the ridiculous story

1072
01:06:17,511 --> 01:06:20,377
about your daughter
running off with a murderer.

1073
01:06:20,411 --> 01:06:22,877
saw right through that,
did ya?

1074
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:25,377
well, i'm a trained
professional, bree.

1075
01:06:25,411 --> 01:06:29,211
the human mind
is my playground.

1076
01:06:29,244 --> 01:06:31,578
well, i'm glad
that you're having fun.

1077
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:33,578
i'm sorry.
i don't mean to be flip.

1078
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:37,411
but you came here
because you were troubled,

1079
01:06:37,444 --> 01:06:41,077
and then you refuse
any help we give you.

1080
01:06:41,111 --> 01:06:44,344
things were falling apart
at home, and i just...

1081
01:06:44,377 --> 01:06:47,977
i just needed a place
to rest, that's all.

1082
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:50,677
i think there's more to it
than that.

1083
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:51,677
do y?

1084
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:54,010
i think it has to do
with your kids.

1085
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:57,244
you don't want to talk
about them.

1086
01:06:57,277 --> 01:06:58,743
why is that?

1087
01:06:58,777 --> 01:07:03,111
probably because
i'm ashamed.

1088
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:05,111
ashamed?

1089
01:07:05,144 --> 01:07:07,111
my children were my life.

1090
01:07:07,144 --> 01:07:09,710
they were the reason that
i got up in the morning,

1091
01:07:09,743 --> 01:07:11,710
so to have failed them
as a parent...

1092
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,478
you think you failed them
as a parent?

1093
01:07:13,511 --> 01:07:14,944
well, my son is a sociopath,

1094
01:07:14,977 --> 01:07:17,910
and my daughter hates me enough
to have run away from home.

1095
01:07:17,944 --> 01:07:19,677
i'm certainly not gonna get

1096
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:22,977
"mother of the year"
anytime soon.
if your kids were here
right now,

1097
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:25,977
what would you tell them?
i would beg my son andrew
for forgiveness

1098
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:27,977
for having given up on him,

1099
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,478
and i would tell my daughter
not to worry,

1100
01:07:30,511 --> 01:07:32,544
that i have a plan
to protect her.

1101
01:07:32,578 --> 01:07:36,177
and just what is that plan?

1102
01:08:16,957 --> 01:08:18,890
 i've got everything
ready to go--

1103
01:08:18,923 --> 01:08:21,391
flowers, candles,
elvis costello cd all cued up.

1104
01:08:21,424 --> 01:08:22,890
but who has the ring?
he does.

1105
01:08:22,923 --> 01:08:25,057
so, wait, you're gonna get
down on one knee,

1106
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:27,224
pop the question,
and while you're down there,

1107
01:08:27,257 --> 01:08:29,224
dig in his pocket?
what if you pull out
his key chain?

1108
01:08:29,257 --> 01:08:32,157
then i'm gonna have to find
a way to force it on my finger.

1109
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:34,391
 <i>(carlos) oh, xiao-mei, where'd</i>
 <i>you learn to kiss like that?</i>

1110
01:08:34,424 --> 01:08:36,357
sorry,
that's penny's baby monitor.

1111
01:08:36,391 --> 01:08:38,157
it's always picking up
weird frequencies.
no, no, no!
don't turn it off.

1112
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:42,357
 <i>ohh! move over.</i>
 <i>my knees hit the dashboard.</i>

1113
01:08:42,391 --> 01:08:46,257
 <i>(xiao-mei)</i>
 <i>i move seat back. better?</i>

1114
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:48,391
 <i>oh, yeah.</i>

1115
01:09:27,657 --> 01:09:30,157
are you done
with my husband?

1116
01:09:32,424 --> 01:09:33,957
good.

1117
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:40,290
i have a little project
for you.

1118
01:09:40,324 --> 01:09:43,057
okay, gaby, can we please
talk about this?!

1119
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:46,023
you're the one that gave me
permission, remember?

1120
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:47,858
you said, "go have sexwith somebody"!

1121
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:49,591
to have meaningless sex,
carlos,

1122
01:09:49,624 --> 01:09:52,090
not to sleep with the woman
who's carrying our child!

1123
01:09:52,124 --> 01:09:54,424
what is the matter?!
look, we're even!

1124
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:56,724
you had an affair,
and i had an affair!

1125
01:09:56,758 --> 01:09:59,224
i had a reason to.
you were never here!

1126
01:09:59,257 --> 01:10:00,758
i've been here, carlos.

1127
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:03,691
i have tried so hard
to not be selfish

1128
01:10:03,724 --> 01:10:05,691
and to put your needs
above mine.

1129
01:10:05,724 --> 01:10:07,657
i mean, for god sakes,
look at me!

1130
01:10:07,691 --> 01:10:10,090
i have agreed to be
a mother for you!

1131
01:10:10,124 --> 01:10:12,624
look, gaby, you have
every right to be mad at me.

1132
01:10:12,657 --> 01:10:15,491
so i'm gonna go
and check into a hotel room

1133
01:10:15,524 --> 01:10:18,457
and let you cool down, but we
 <i>are</i> going to work this out.

1134
01:10:18,491 --> 01:10:20,990
forget the hotel, carlos.
get a lease.

1135
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:31,791
i can go now, too?

1136
01:10:31,824 --> 01:10:34,391
no, you can start dinner.

1137
01:10:34,424 --> 01:10:35,457
what?!

1138
01:10:35,491 --> 01:10:38,824
you're not going awhere,

1139
01:10:38,858 --> 01:10:41,990
not as long as you have
my baby in your belly.

1140
01:10:44,624 --> 01:10:46,691
(speaks chinese)

1141
01:10:48,923 --> 01:10:51,890
i don't know what that meant,
but i didn't like the tone.

1142
01:10:51,923 --> 01:10:54,391
so just remember,
am the boss of you,

1143
01:10:54,424 --> 01:10:56,391
or else
i'm gonna make this

1144
01:10:56,424 --> 01:10:59,124
the worst nine months
of your life.

1145
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:07,824
hi.
hi.

1146
01:11:07,858 --> 01:11:10,124
did you get the check?

1147
01:11:10,157 --> 01:11:12,624
yeah, i wanted to talk
to you about that.

1148
01:11:12,657 --> 01:11:14,657
do you have a minute?

1149
01:11:14,691 --> 01:11:16,657
tom?!

1150
01:11:16,691 --> 01:11:18,657
i'm not the type of person

1151
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:22,357
that can keep things
bottled up inside.

1152
01:11:22,391 --> 01:11:25,957
really?
so i'm just gonna have
to get this off my chest.

1153
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:28,457
you made me feel really bad
about myself

1154
01:11:28,491 --> 01:11:30,758
yesterday at the restaurant.

1155
01:11:30,791 --> 01:11:33,824
my sincerest apologies.

1156
01:11:33,858 --> 01:11:36,324
you treated me
like some sort of mercenary,

1157
01:11:36,357 --> 01:11:38,324
like the only reason
i came here

1158
01:11:38,357 --> 01:11:39,990
was to extort money from you.

1159
01:11:40,023 --> 01:11:42,457
well, to be honest,
first, we bought you pie,

1160
01:11:42,491 --> 01:11:44,657
then you tried
to extort money from us.

1161
01:11:44,691 --> 01:11:49,057
see? there it is again,
lynette--that mean streak.

1162
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:51,290
all i want is what's bestfor my 

1163
01:11:51,324 --> 01:11:53,524
fortom'schild.

1164
01:11:53,557 --> 01:11:56,023
as the mother of 80%
of tom's children,

1165
01:11:56,057 --> 01:11:58,524
i don't think
it's in their best interest

1166
01:11:58,557 --> 01:12:01,324
for you to drive us
into bankruptcy.
of course it isn't.

1167
01:12:04,357 --> 01:12:06,023
here.

1168
01:12:06,057 --> 01:12:07,624
i signed the waiver

1169
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:10,290
that the lawyer sent over
with the check.

1170
01:12:12,357 --> 01:12:16,557
and i'm not even asking
for any back child support.

1171
01:12:16,591 --> 01:12:18,791
that's--that's--that's great.
thank yo

1172
01:12:18,824 --> 01:12:21,957
see, lynette? see?
it's not all about money.

1173
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:25,557
it's not even a little bit
about money. it's about family.

1174
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:28,758
'cause we're all
a big family now.

1175
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:31,124
sort of.

1176
01:12:31,157 --> 01:12:34,391
which ishy i took
all the money that you gave me,

1177
01:12:34,424 --> 01:12:36,391
and i put it all down

1178
01:12:36,424 --> 01:12:38,890
on the sweetest little
2-bedroom house

1179
01:12:38,923 --> 01:12:42,758
over on arden drive.

1180
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,758
ar-arden drive over--
over by the mall?

1181
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:47,990
like, five minutes
from here arden drive?

1182
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:52,357
it's perfect. i could drop
kayla off here anytime

1183
01:12:52,391 --> 01:12:54,724
so she can play
with her new siblings.

1184
01:12:54,758 --> 01:12:56,657
she can spend time
with her dad.

1185
01:12:56,691 --> 01:13:00,591
well, to be clear,
how are you going to live?

1186
01:13:00,624 --> 01:13:02,923
hoare you going to pay
the mortgage?

1187
01:13:02,957 --> 01:13:06,157
you don't have a job here.
what is your problem
with me, lady?!

1188
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:08,890
i don't understand!
you don't know me.

1189
01:13:08,923 --> 01:13:10,657
you don't know what i can do.

1190
01:13:10,691 --> 01:13:13,424
and yet you just always,
just... (chitters)

1191
01:13:13,457 --> 01:13:16,257
just--just... (squeals)

1192
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:19,724
always on the attack. it's ugly,
and you should work on that.

1193
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:23,990
here's what i think.

1194
01:13:24,023 --> 01:13:25,923
i think that we should
all work on this,

1195
01:13:25,957 --> 01:13:28,923
because i don't want
every christmas to turn ugly

1196
01:13:28,957 --> 01:13:31,923
just because you and i
don't get along.

1197
01:13:31,957 --> 01:13:35,624
yeah, that would be a ame.

1198
01:14:24,957 --> 01:14:26,924
see, i told you
she wasn't home.

1199
01:14:26,957 --> 01:14:29,558
her car's not even here.

1200
01:14:29,623 --> 01:14:32,124
and you said the safe
was upstairs?

1201
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:42,324
damn it, my mother must have
changed the combination.

1202
01:14:44,191 --> 01:14:48,657
okay. wait here.
i'll be right back.

1203
01:15:01,524 --> 01:15:04,024
you did it.

1204
01:15:09,723 --> 01:15:11,391
you killed melanie.

1205
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:14,091
you put your jacket
on her body.

1206
01:15:14,124 --> 01:15:17,857
i saw it, matthew.

1207
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:20,524
the police showed me
the pictures.

1208
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:23,224
now you weren't there.
you don't know what happened.

1209
01:15:23,257 --> 01:15:24,424
oh, god.

1210
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:26,690
caleb hurt her,

1211
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:29,558
and melanie threatened to bring
us all down because of that.

1212
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:31,924
so your solution was to make
your brother think

1213
01:15:31,957 --> 01:15:34,357
he murdered a girl
and to make <i>me</i> think it?

1214
01:15:34,391 --> 01:15:35,924
what other choice did i have?

1215
01:15:35,957 --> 01:15:38,690
i knew that you wouldn't
had caleb over to the police.

1216
01:15:38,723 --> 01:15:40,690
i knew that
you would protect him.

1217
01:15:40,723 --> 01:15:42,224
i would have protected you.

1218
01:15:42,257 --> 01:15:44,124
well, i really couldn't
count on that.

1219
01:15:44,157 --> 01:15:45,590
matthew...

1220
01:15:45,623 --> 01:15:48,990
you don't love me
as much as you love caleb.

1221
01:15:49,024 --> 01:15:50,524
you nevehave.

1222
01:15:52,857 --> 01:15:54,824
perhaps.

1223
01:15:54,857 --> 01:15:57,623
but it's because
he's needed me more.

1224
01:15:57,657 --> 01:16:00,790
you are always going to
find love in the world.

1225
01:16:00,824 --> 01:16:02,590
don't you understand?

1226
01:16:02,623 --> 01:16:06,024
he was only ever
going to get it from me.

1227
01:16:06,057 --> 01:16:08,424
you know,
i know you believe that.

1228
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:13,357
that's why i've tried
so hard to forgive you.

1229
01:16:15,224 --> 01:16:16,690
and who knows?

1230
01:16:16,723 --> 01:16:20,558
maybe one day i will.

1231
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:38,924
(woman) 9-1-1.
what is your emergency?

1232
01:16:38,957 --> 01:16:41,558
i need the police.

1233
01:16:47,723 --> 01:16:49,890
see, i told you
she had cash.

1234
01:17:12,057 --> 01:17:14,524
daniel, i don't know
what you're planning,

1235
01:17:14,558 --> 01:17:17,458
but i need to talk to you
right now.

1236
01:17:17,491 --> 01:17:19,391
give it up, mom.
we're leaving.

1237
01:17:19,424 --> 01:17:21,024
i'm calling the police.

1238
01:17:25,924 --> 01:17:28,757
do you remember
that girl melanie foster?

1239
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:32,590
matthew is the one
who killed her.

1240
01:17:32,623 --> 01:17:35,091
i know you don't want us
to be together,

1241
01:17:35,124 --> 01:17:38,391
but that's the lamest thing
i've ever heard.

1242
01:17:38,424 --> 01:17:41,124
his mother told me
what happened. it's true.

1243
01:17:45,558 --> 01:17:47,224
let's go, danielle.

1244
01:17:56,257 --> 01:17:58,157
mom, please move.

1245
01:17:58,191 --> 01:18:00,157
no.
i gave up on your brother,

1246
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:02,990
and i'm not gonna make
that mistake with you.

1247
01:18:03,024 --> 01:18:06,424
we don't have time for this.

1248
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:10,157
where did you get that?
what are you doing?!

1249
01:18:10,191 --> 01:18:11,657
move away!

1250
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:13,291
danielle...

1251
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:17,424
i want you to get out
of the house now.

1252
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:19,424
he's a killer.
shut up!

1253
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:21,057
don't point that
at my mother!

1254
01:18:21,091 --> 01:18:22,690
danielle!

1255
01:18:22,723 --> 01:18:24,324
i'm serious. go.

1256
01:18:24,357 --> 01:18:25,790
what's wrong with you?!

1257
01:18:25,824 --> 01:18:27,491
i'm gonna shoot you!

1258
01:18:27,524 --> 01:18:30,257
matthew, stop it!

1259
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:38,391
if that's what it takes...

1260
01:18:40,458 --> 01:18:41,924
to get my daughter...

1261
01:18:41,957 --> 01:18:44,957
stop it!
to see who you really are...

1262
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:47,623
stop pointing that
at my mother!

1263
01:18:47,657 --> 01:18:48,924
then fine.

1264
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:53,623
what are you doing?!
do it.

1265
01:18:53,657 --> 01:18:55,391
stop!

1266
01:19:33,424 --> 01:19:35,124
it's okay, baby.

1267
01:20:39,857 --> 01:20:42,690
hey, it's just me again.
um...

1268
01:20:42,723 --> 01:20:44,690
when you got the invitation,

1269
01:20:44,723 --> 01:20:47,191
i thought that you gave me
the thumbs up,

1270
01:20:47,224 --> 01:20:50,857
but i guess
if that was actually...

1271
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:54,524
some other type
of finger gesture, uh...

1272
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:58,024
well, i apologize for leaving
you all these messages

1273
01:20:58,057 --> 01:21:01,458
and wasting your time.

1274
01:21:05,824 --> 01:21:09,524
(generator shuts off)

1275
01:21:44,690 --> 01:21:47,890
 <i>this is the street</i>
 <i>where i used to live...</i>

1276
01:21:49,391 --> 01:21:54,690
 <i>and these were the people</i>
 <i>with whom i shared my life.</i>

1277
01:21:54,723 --> 01:21:57,723
 <i>i met them the day</i>
 <i>they moved in.</i>

1278
01:22:00,924 --> 01:22:04,324
 <i>and i saw</i>
 <i>what they brought with them...</i>

1279
01:22:07,458 --> 01:22:11,291
 <i>beautiful dreams</i>
 <i>for the future.</i>

1280
01:22:11,324 --> 01:22:16,057
 <i>and quiet hopes</i>
 <i>for a better life...</i>

1281
01:22:18,524 --> 01:22:23,690
 <i>not just for themselves,</i>
 <i>but for their children, too.</i>

1282
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:29,990
 <i>if i could, would i tell them</i>
 <i>what lies ahead?</i>

1283
01:22:30,024 --> 01:22:32,990
 <i>would i warn them</i>
of the sorrow and betrayal

1284
01:22:33,024 --> 01:22:36,491
 <i>that lie in store?</i>

1285
01:22:36,524 --> 01:22:39,890
 <i>no. from where i stand now,</i>

1286
01:22:39,924 --> 01:22:42,391
 <i>i see enough of the road</i>
 <i>to understand</i>

1287
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:46,424
 <i>how it must be traveled.</i>

1288
01:22:46,458 --> 01:22:50,458
 <i>the trip</i>
 <i>is to keep moving forward,</i>

1289
01:22:50,491 --> 01:22:52,990
 <i>to let go of the fear</i>
 <i>and the regret</i>

1290
01:22:53,024 --> 01:22:54,657
 <i>that slow us down</i>

1291
01:22:54,690 --> 01:22:57,124
 <i>and keep us from enjoying</i>
 <i>a journey</i>

1292
01:22:57,157 --> 01:23:00,024
 <i>that will be over too soon.</i>

1293
01:23:02,024 --> 01:23:07,391
 <i>yes, there will be</i>
 <i>unexpected bends in the road,</i>

1294
01:23:07,424 --> 01:23:12,057
 <i>shocking surprises</i>
 <i>we didn't see coming,</i>

1295
01:23:12,091 --> 01:23:15,024
 <i>but that's really the point...</i>

1296
01:23:15,057 --> 01:23:16,524
 <i>don't ya think?</i>

1297
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:18,324
orson.
oh, hey.

1298
01:23:18,357 --> 01:23:20,824
i wanted to come by
and see how you were doing

1299
01:23:20,857 --> 01:23:23,857
after your great escape,
and, uh, these are for you.

1300
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:28,458
how sweet
and... unexpected.

1301
01:23:32,191 --> 01:23:34,224
do you wanna come in?

1302
01:23:34,257 --> 01:23:36,558
i'd love to.
