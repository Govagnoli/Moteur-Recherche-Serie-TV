00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
<i>Previously on "Desperate Housewives", ...

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,000
She packed up the kids and the puppy and left.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Packed them up? Why?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,400
She followed you to Atlantic City.
She knows about your other woman.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,800
<i>...things went from bad...

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,300
Put your hands where I can see them.

7
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,700
<i>...to considerably worse.

8
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,300
Man, she's good.

9
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,100
Looks like the insemination was successful.

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,300
Oh!
- Oh my god!

11
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,500
<i>And even the good news...

12
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,700
She's the priority now!
She's the mother of my child!

13
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,000
<i>...came with a catch.

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,800
Given any thought to staying at my place?

15
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,400
I think I'm gonna have to pass.

16
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,800
No, I'm stronger than people give me credit for.

17
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,300
<i>But sometimes,
once you accept the truth,

18
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,300
<i>you discover that you're capable...

19
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,300
Let's just get out of here!

20
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,400
<i>...of accomplishing...

21
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,000
I'd like to admit myself for psychiatric observation.

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,900
I'm about to have a nervous breakdown.

23
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,000
<i>...almost anything.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,100
<i>It's a fact of life in every neighborhood:

25
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,500
<i>People move in,
and people move out.

26
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,500
<i>Although very few of them
pack up and leave at 2am.

27
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,900
<i>But it wasn't the first time

28
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,800
<i>that Betty Applewhite had
tried to leave in the middle of the night.

29
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,800
<i>It had happened once before,
in Chicago.

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,500
<i>The same night one of her sons
tried to break up with his girlfriend,...

31
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,500
<i>...a young woman named Melanie Foster.

32
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,100
Are you kidding?
You cannot dump me!

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,200
I do not get dumped!

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,100
If anyone is getting dumped here, it's you.

35
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,900
However you want to spell it,
it's fine. OK?

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,000
I just want out.
I just want out!

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,800
OK. Matthew--

38
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,800
maybe I am a bitch sometimes,
but there are advantages to dating someone like me.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,200
And I know that you know what I'm talking about.

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,200
Melanie, my mother is in the other room.
Are you crazy?

41
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,000
Clearly, we can't have a serious discussion here.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,500
Why don't you meet me at the lumber yard at nine?

43
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,900
Melanie, it's over.

44
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,900
Well, even more reason for you to show up.

45
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,900
No one can say goodbye better than I do.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,300
Oh, it's about time.

47
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,400
Caleb!

48
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,200
What are you doing here?
Where's Matthew?

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,700
I got here first.
I know a shortcut.

50
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,800
Does Matthew know that you're here?

51
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,000
No.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,300
He--he doesn't want to be with you anymore.

53
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,800
What does that have to do with you?

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,100
See, I thought--

55
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,600
maybe I could be your boyfriend now.

56
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
What?

57
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,300
I love you.

58
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,500
Oh God, please tell me
someone put you up to this! No?

59
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,100
Could you be serious?

60
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,900
It's too pathetic!

61
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,700
What the hell are you doing?

62
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,700
Get off of me, you--

63
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,300
Melanie?

64
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,100
<i>Yes, a year had come and gone
since the Applewhites had left Chicago.

65
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,900
<i>And Betty thought they could again
slip away in the middle of the night.

66
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,100
Once we move,
how's Matthew goin' find us?

67
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,100
Caleb, I think this is going to be you and me from now on.

68
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Up with your hands!
Put your hands up!

69
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,800
<i>But as she soon discovered,

70
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,900
<i>it's not that easy
to slip away in the suburbs.

71
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,900
<i>Because in Suburbia,
once the neighbors hear you going,

72
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,500
<i>they all insist on showing up

73
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,500
<i>to say goodbye.

74
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,600
<i>Everyone must choose
the road they will take in life.

75
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,600
<i>And for a special few,
that road would lead to Wisteria Lane.

76
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,700
<i>They all arrive the exact same way:

77
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,000
<i>driving up in their overloaded trucks,

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,900
<i>bringing with them their expensive antiques

79
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,900
<i>and ordinary dreams.

80
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,900
<i>I remember the first moment I saw each of them.

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,900
<i>I met Susan Mayer the day she moved to Wisteria Lane.

82
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,000
Ah! OK, break time's over.

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,300
She seemed to delightfully confident,

84
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,300
I couldn't help but feel intimidated.

85
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,200
Oh! Oh! Oh!

86
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,500
That feeling quickly passed.

87
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,000
Help! Can anybody hear me?

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,600
Julie? I need you to try to unlock the door!

89
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,300
Oh, what am I thinking, she's too...

90
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,500
OK-- I need you to unbuckle yourself

91
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,500
and try to find a neighbor!

92
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,100
But don't cross the street!

93
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,800
Just tell the neighbor
that your Mommie's stuck in a big truck!

94
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,100
Oh, yes!
My God, I have a genius baby!

95
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,000
Hi.

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,400
I have a normal baby.

97
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,300
I'm Mary Alice.
I live across the street.

98
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,200
Susan Mayer. Thank you so much!

99
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,000
If my husband had had to rescue me,
I would have never heard the end of it.

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He thinks I'm a total klutz.

101
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,337
Oh, please,
that's what neighbors are for.

102
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,771
Well,
welcome to Wisteria Lane.

103
00:07:15,804 --> 00:07:17,771
When you're
finished unpacking,

104
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,270
why don't you come over
for a cup of coffee?

105
00:07:20,304 --> 00:07:22,270
Oh, wow!

106
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:26,904
I have a neighbor who just
asked me over for coffee.

107
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,304
I'm sorry.
You must think I'm a lunatic.

108
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:34,103
Oh, no, no, I don't.
I think you're charming.

109
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:36,370
And your baby looks
like a genius to me.

110
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:38,537
Oh, she is.

111
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:41,137
And we're gonna be
so happy here.

112
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,337
 
Look at your new home.

113
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:50,771
You're not gonna walk me
into a wall, are you?

114
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,771
Of course not, but when
you see it for the first time,

115
00:07:53,804 --> 00:07:56,370
I want you to get
the whole impact.

116
00:07:56,404 --> 00:07:58,337
Ta-da!

117
00:07:59,837 --> 00:08:02,004
Okay, now I know
it's a little more cramped

118
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:04,504
than we're used to, but we
can't stay at Bree's forever.

119
00:08:04,537 --> 00:08:06,904
She's gonna be coming back
from that spa vacation soon.

120
00:08:06,938 --> 00:08:09,203
Besides, it's gonna be fun.
Why are you doing this to me?

121
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:11,404
I get good grades.
I don't do drugs.

122
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:13,771
I've never come home
pregnant.

123
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:17,237
Honey, I am trying my hardest
to stand on my own two feet.

124
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,771
All right, I've got six
book proposals in the works.

125
00:08:19,804 --> 00:08:23,170
I'm gonna try to supervise
the rebuilding of this house,

126
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,671
But you know, I can't do it
without your support.

127
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:29,404
And I want you
to be proud of me.

128
00:08:31,404 --> 00:08:35,103
  Fine.
Let's take a look inside.

129
00:08:35,137 --> 00:08:37,604
Ohh! That's my girl.
 

130
00:08:37,637 --> 00:08:41,038
So... is there anything
you should prepare me for?

131
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,437
No! No. it's all good.

132
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,604
Oh! But you should know

133
00:08:45,637 --> 00:08:47,571
that your bed doubles
as the dining table,

134
00:08:47,604 --> 00:08:49,604
and the toilet's
in the shower.

135
00:08:51,137 --> 00:08:53,637
Honey, look. I bought us
matching golf outfits

136
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:55,404
for our lessons tomorrow.

137
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:56,904
Yeah, about that--
I can't go.

138
00:08:56,938 --> 00:08:58,904
I gotta pick up trash
on the freeway.

139
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,370
I'm sorry?

140
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:01,737
I have to do
my community service.

141
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:03,737
It's part of my parole,
remember?

142
00:09:03,771 --> 00:09:06,237
Oh, okay, well, I'll just
call the country club

143
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,203
and cancel our lessons.
No, no, no.

144
00:09:08,237 --> 00:09:11,070
I can't, I paid already.
Might as well go without me.

145
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:13,938
I don't wanna go alone.
It was your idea in the first place.

146
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,938
And I'd love to be there
with you, too,

147
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:18,137
if I didn't have to scrape
slushies and condoms

148
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,137
off route 57.
Look, what's the big deal?

149
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,637
Just go take the stupid lesson.

150
00:09:21,671 --> 00:09:24,304
Fine, if you feel that way about it.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

151
00:09:26,604 --> 00:09:29,038
Oh, would you look
at this crap?

152
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,070
He has been doing that all day.

153
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:38,437
Ralph has a little crush.
So?

154
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,470
So can't I get a gardener

155
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:42,971
Who isn't trying to sleep
with someone in my house?

156
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:46,637
You pay 6 bucks an hour.
It's all about the perks, honey.

157
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,804
Susan,
have you talked to Lynette?

158
00:09:54,837 --> 00:09:57,504
Uh, no.
Have you tried her cell?

159
00:09:57,537 --> 00:10:00,337
Yeah, she isn't picking up.
Do you know where she is?

160
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,671
Uh, no, I'm sorry.

161
00:10:02,704 --> 00:10:05,470
Susan, I think you do.

162
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,304
I really don't, Tom.

163
00:10:08,337 --> 00:10:09,804
Is everything okay?

164
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:11,571
Yeah. Yeah,
we just had a fight.

165
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:13,904
Listen, if you talk to her,

166
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:16,938
will you please ask her
to call me?

167
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:20,038
Thank you.

168
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:30,103
 
Hello?

169
00:10:30,137 --> 00:10:32,737
He was just here.

170
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:34,737
I think you should call him.

171
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:39,704
I can't. I can't.
I'm sorry. I just can't.

172
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:41,437
Mom!
Yeah. Hang on.

173
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,237
I'll call you later.
Okay. Bye.

174
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,537
Yeah?

175
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:48,437
When is Daddy coming?
I wanna show him my dive.

176
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,737
He's not coming, sweetheart.

177
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,203
But you could show me.

178
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:05,704
 

179
00:11:05,737 --> 00:11:07,704
You have to talk to Noah.

180
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:10,270
But he creeps me out.
Who cares?

181
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:11,771
This is my life
we're talking about.

182
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,804
I need a big-time lawyer
in my corner,

183
00:11:13,837 --> 00:11:16,304
and where else are we gonna
get that kind of money?

184
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:19,237
Noah's not gonna give me a dime
if he knows it's for you.

185
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,270
He hates your guts.
Tell him it's for you.

186
00:11:21,304 --> 00:11:22,971
Tell him you want a car.

187
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:25,504
Tell him you're ready for him
to buy your love. Trust me.

188
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:27,737
Dying men are nothing
if not sentimental.

189
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,737
Why do you need so much,
anyway?

190
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:33,237
I thought only guilty men
needed expensive lawyers.

191
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,837
Felicia has obviously been
planning this for months.

192
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:38,938
Who knows what other kind
of evidence she's planted?

193
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:41,737
with my luck, they'll open up
the Martha Huber murder again,

194
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:43,737
try to nail me
with some DNA.

195
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:48,070
You swore to me that you had
nothing to do with that.

196
00:11:48,103 --> 00:11:50,137
I didn't.

197
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,571
Look, why are we arguing?

198
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:56,038
I'm your father.
Do what I'm telling you to do.

199
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,938
You're not my real father.

200
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:03,270
You ungrateful little...

201
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:05,604
I rescue you
from that miserable junkie.

202
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:07,604
I give you a home,
a life worth living,

203
00:12:13,137 --> 00:12:15,103
I need the money, Zach.

204
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:17,103
If you won't do it for me,

205
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:19,304
at least do it
for your mother.

206
00:12:21,437 --> 00:12:24,671
After all, she killed herself
trying to protect you.

207
00:12:38,027 --> 00:12:39,994
<i>I met Bree Van De Kamp</i>

208
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:42,493
<i>the first day she moved</i>
<i>to Wisteria Lane.</i>

209
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:44,994
<i>there are certain people,</i>
<i>who, when you meet them,</i>

210
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:48,428
<i>can't help but make</i>
<i>a delightful first impression.</i>

211
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,027
Hello. I'm Bree Van De Kamp,
your new neighbor.

212
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,527
Is this your frog?

213
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,894
<i>Bree was not one of them.</i>

214
00:12:54,927 --> 00:12:56,227
Yes. Why?

215
00:12:56,261 --> 00:13:00,560
Well, it seems that my son
stole it from your yard.

216
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:02,294
Oh, well, I don't mind.

217
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:04,827
If he likes it so much,
he's welcome to keep it.

218
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,827
Well, don't tell him that.

219
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,328
If he doesn't feel guilty,
he'll never learn shame.

220
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:11,294
Hey, what's going on?

221
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:13,894
Oh. Um, this I
our new neighbor.

222
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:16,394
It seems her son accidentally
took my garden frog.

223
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,994
Oh.

224
00:13:18,027 --> 00:13:19,994
Please don't make excuses
for him.

225
00:13:20,027 --> 00:13:22,827
That is exactly what
his father does. Rex!

226
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:29,094
This is my husband Rex.

227
00:13:29,127 --> 00:13:32,094
Hi. We're not weird.
We just seem like we are.

228
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:35,227
And this is my son...

229
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:36,460
the criminal.

230
00:13:37,727 --> 00:13:39,127
Go on.

231
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:42,460
I'm sorry I stole from you.

232
00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:46,027
Just so you know, my Mom
did teach me right from wrong,

233
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:47,961
so my actions should in no way

234
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:51,294
influence your opinion
of her as a parent.

235
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:57,460
Wow.
Well, is there anything
you'd like to say to my son?

236
00:13:57,493 --> 00:13:59,560
Feel free to be harsh.

237
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:04,460
No, I'm... I'm good.

238
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:07,361
Well, now that we've finished
with all this unpleasantness,

239
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:09,361
I want to assure you

240
00:14:09,394 --> 00:14:11,361
that we are going to be
good neighbors,

241
00:14:11,394 --> 00:14:14,261
and I hope in time,
great friends.

242
00:14:14,294 --> 00:14:16,760
That sounds... lovely.

243
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:19,627
Come on.

244
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,627
Oh, wait.
I'm--I'm sorry.

245
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,027
It was Rex, Andrew and...
what was your name again?

246
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:28,460
Bree?

247
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,527
What?

248
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,527
You're Bree Van De Kamp,
right?

249
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,027
Do I know you?

250
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:36,527
Orson Hodge.
Uh, Susan's dentist friend.

251
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,527
We met after her house
burned down.

252
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,694
Oh. I'm so sorry.
I didn't recognize you.

253
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:43,660
Small word, huh?

254
00:14:43,694 --> 00:14:46,660
Yes. Uh, excruciatingly so.

255
00:14:46,694 --> 00:14:47,794
Ah.

256
00:14:47,827 --> 00:14:50,127
What are you doing here?

257
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:53,660
Well, three or four times
a week, I visit my--my friend.

258
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,460
What about you?

259
00:14:56,493 --> 00:14:59,493
Oh, I just thought id be
a lovely place

260
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:01,493
to take a nice, long rest.

261
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:03,127
Ah.

262
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:04,394
Um, listen,

263
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:07,527
I told my friends that
I was, um, I was at a spa,

264
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,294
so if you run into Susan,
I--
your secret is safe.

265
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:11,493
And seriously...

266
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:14,294
  I am not
like these other people.

267
00:15:14,328 --> 00:15:16,961
Oh, I can tell.

268
00:15:16,994 --> 00:15:18,994
A real lady always
stands out in a crowd.

269
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:22,394
Well, that was...
very sweet.

270
00:15:22,428 --> 00:15:26,328
Enjoy your rest,
Bree Van De Kamp.

271
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:35,760
Boy, do I feel for you.

272
00:15:35,794 --> 00:15:38,694
Trying to convince your friends
that you're still normal,

273
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:40,694
and you're surrounded
by a bunch of loons.

274
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:42,261
You, too?

275
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:44,194
Oh, please.

276
00:15:44,227 --> 00:15:47,161
Dr. Barr goes out of his way
to make me feel

277
00:15:47,194 --> 00:15:48,660
like a complete psychopath.

278
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:51,593
I think he's crazier
than the patients, actually.

279
00:15:54,094 --> 00:15:57,261
You know that, um,
that woman in the wheelchair?

280
00:15:57,294 --> 00:16:00,061
What's her story?
Yeah, she's a kooky one.

281
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:02,061
She hasn't spoken a word
since she got here.

282
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,560
She just sits there
all day long

283
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:05,760
waiting for your friend
to come and visit.

284
00:16:05,794 --> 00:16:07,727
He talks to her for hours,

285
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,460
but I don't even think
she can hear him.

286
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,961
Oh, hi.

287
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:25,161
You said to stop by
for coffee sometime.

288
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:28,227
I got coffee.

289
00:16:28,261 --> 00:16:31,394
So I can't believe
you caught me spraying for ants.

290
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:33,394
I must look like a wreck.

291
00:16:33,428 --> 00:16:35,394
Actually,
you look kinda sexy.

292
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,927
You've gotta be kidding.

293
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:39,493
Oh, the way you're taking
charge--it's impressive.

294
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:41,894
They're just ants,
and they're tiny.

295
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:43,894
Of course,
they do outnumber me.

296
00:16:43,927 --> 00:16:46,394
Oh, you said you wanted
to handle things yourself,

297
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:48,894
and you're making it happen.
It's good to see.

298
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:51,361
Thanks.

299
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:53,361
Even if it does mean

300
00:16:53,394 --> 00:16:56,094
you're not in the market
for a relationship right now.

301
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:58,794
Oh. Did I say that?

302
00:16:58,827 --> 00:17:01,428
You certainly implied it.

303
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,961
Well, sometimes I say things
I don't mean.

304
00:17:04,994 --> 00:17:09,560
I blame it on my frequent
exposure to ant spray.

305
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:11,961
What the hell is this?

306
00:17:11,994 --> 00:17:14,860
Karl. What do you want?

307
00:17:14,894 --> 00:17:16,994
Well, I can't believe
you're forcing our daughter

308
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:18,994
to live in a house
with wheels.

309
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:20,994
I think we need
to talk about this.

310
00:17:21,027 --> 00:17:22,094
It's temporary,

311
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:24,593
and if you don't mind,
I'm having coffee.

312
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,527
Oh, it's okay, Susan.

313
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,794
Hey, sorry. I don't mean
to chase you out, buddy,

314
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:32,227
but, uh, this is really
a family thing.

315
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:34,261
Oh, no, I understand.

316
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:35,560
Cool.

317
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,560
Mmm.

318
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:45,727
I'll call you later.

319
00:17:51,994 --> 00:17:53,961
You've got a great swing.

320
00:17:53,994 --> 00:17:56,460
You just need a little help
around the greens.

321
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,460
You know what they say--

322
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,961
drive for show,
putt for dough. Am I right?

323
00:18:00,994 --> 00:18:02,961
  That is so true.

324
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:04,961
All right.
I'll see you out there.
Okay.

325
00:18:04,994 --> 00:18:07,194
Make me something strong.

326
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:09,593
I have nine more holes
with that guy.

327
00:18:09,627 --> 00:18:12,760
<i>Jim, it was just an hour ago</i>
<i>that the road crew</i>

328
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:14,593
<i>working here on route 57</i>

329
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,727
<i>saw a member of their own</i>
<i>killed by oncoming traffic.</i>

330
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,727
<i>the victim was a Hispanic male</i>
<i>in his early 40s</i>

331
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,727
<i>who, for years, was a prominent</i>
<i>businessman in the area.</i>

332
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,727
<i>police aren't releasing a name</i>

333
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,994
<i>until the next of kin</i>

334
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:29,994
<i>we, of course,</i>

335
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:31,994
<i>on any late-breaking</i>

336
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,493
<i>as this tragic story unfolds.</i>
 

337
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:35,994
<i>reporting live from route 57,</i>
<i>this is Craig Siyumina.</i>

338
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:38,428
<i>back to you.</i>

339
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:51,360
Mrs. Solis!
Why you home?

340
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:55,494
Carlos is dead, Xiao-mei.

341
00:18:55,527 --> 00:18:57,594
No, please don't kill him.

342
00:18:57,627 --> 00:19:00,460
No, you don't understand.
He's already dead.

343
00:19:00,494 --> 00:19:02,193
There was an accident.

344
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:05,327
He's all over the highway.

345
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,460
No...

346
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:09,527
he in kitchen.

347
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,794
Hey, babe.
Why you home so early?

348
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,961
Oh, honey!
Oh, you're not dead!

349
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:25,994
Who said I was dead?

350
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:29,460
The police. They called me.
- What are you talking about?

351
00:19:29,494 --> 00:19:31,460
Honey, they didn't know
all the details,

352
00:19:31,494 --> 00:19:33,460
but a witness said
that they saw you

353
00:19:33,494 --> 00:19:36,460
run into the carpool lane
to pick up a lawn chair

354
00:19:36,494 --> 00:19:37,961
that had fallen
off some truck,

355
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:40,727
and then a bus hit you
right in front of the road crew.

356
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:44,694
Why aren't you at the road crew?
- I paid Ralph to go in my place.

357
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:46,160
What?

358
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:49,227
Well, Carlos,
they had your name.

359
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,093
Oh, no. poor Ralph.

360
00:19:52,127 --> 00:19:53,827
Oh!

361
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:55,794
Why is your back
all sweaty?

362
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,028
I was working out
on the treadmill.

363
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,961
Barefoot?

364
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:02,460
  For God sakes,
Gabrielle, Ralph just died,

365
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,460
and you're worried
about my feet?

366
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:08,327
I mean, what the hell
is wrong with you?

367
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,160
My fault.
Sorry.

368
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,994
You must find that
very peaceful.

369
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:29,227
Why would you assume that?

370
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,227
Because that's all you've been
doing for three sessions.

371
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,327
I still don't know
anything about you,

372
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,394
except that you rake
in remarkably straight lines.

373
00:20:37,427 --> 00:20:39,394
Is that what you're doing,

374
00:20:39,427 --> 00:20:41,394
asking me all those
ridiculous questions

375
00:20:41,427 --> 00:20:43,894
about my childhood,
trying to get to know me?

376
00:20:43,928 --> 00:20:45,861
Well, here's a clue.
I'm not crazy.

377
00:20:45,894 --> 00:20:49,360
I just have a few issues.
- And psychotherapy is how we
help you deal with those issues.

378
00:20:49,394 --> 00:20:53,360
What kind of treatment did you
think you were going to get?
- Honestly, I was hoping

379
00:20:53,394 --> 00:20:55,093
that you'd medicate
the hell out of me.

380
00:20:55,127 --> 00:20:57,127
You don't need
anything stronger

381
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,127
than what I've already
prescribed for you.

382
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,227
I have aspirin at home
that packs more of a punch.

383
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,028
It says here
your husband died,

384
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,028
you had a boyfriend
who killed himself,

385
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,060
and you suffer
from alcoholism.

386
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:12,761
That's a lot of trauma
for one year.

387
00:21:12,794 --> 00:21:15,460
What about your kids?

388
00:21:15,494 --> 00:21:18,794
Oh, they're fine.

389
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:21,193
Andrew is backpacking
through Europe,

390
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:24,494
and Danielle is away
at cheerleading camp.

391
00:21:24,527 --> 00:21:26,327
What's your relationship
with them like?

392
00:21:28,561 --> 00:21:30,028
What do you mean?

393
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,561
Are you close?

394
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:34,327
Do they share things
with you?

395
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,427
What do you feel
about them?

396
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:41,928
You know, I really don't
have time for this nonsense.

397
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:44,928
Are you going to give me
some serious drugs or not?

398
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:47,127
No.

399
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,961
Fine. Then I'm going back
to my room.

400
00:21:48,994 --> 00:21:51,527
You know, Bree, I can't
force you to open up to me,

401
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:55,160
but I can make it easier for
you to focus on your problems.

402
00:21:55,193 --> 00:21:56,994
And how are you
going to do that?

403
00:21:57,028 --> 00:21:59,060
I'm going
to tell the orderlies

404
00:21:59,093 --> 00:22:01,060
to confiscate
all your personal items.

405
00:22:01,093 --> 00:22:03,227
I committed myself
voluntarily.

406
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,227
When you signed
those pars,

407
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,427
I became responsible
for your well-being,

408
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,394
and I will help you
in any way I see fit.
- I don't need that much help,

409
00:22:11,427 --> 00:22:13,928
because I am not like
your other patients.
- Oh, sure, you are.

410
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:16,160
You just don't know it yet.

411
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:31,727
Your son confessed to murder.
We've got it on tape.

412
00:22:31,761 --> 00:22:34,694
My son has the mind
of a child, detective.

413
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:36,861
He'd confess to sinking
the Titanic.

414
00:22:39,527 --> 00:22:41,494
This letter was sent
some months ago

415
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,827
to the Chicago police,
saying the person they arrested

416
00:22:44,861 --> 00:22:46,928
for the Melanie Foster murder
was innocent.

417
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:48,327
We have a hunch
you wrote it.

418
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,360
Really? I didn't know hunches
were considered evidence

419
00:22:51,394 --> 00:22:53,060
in a court of law.

420
00:22:53,093 --> 00:22:55,127
  They aren't.

421
00:22:58,427 --> 00:23:00,961
But this is.

422
00:23:00,994 --> 00:23:03,460
We found some of
the assailant's DNA.

423
00:23:03,494 --> 00:23:05,294
On this jacket.

424
00:23:05,327 --> 00:23:09,260
Now all we need
is a matching sample.

425
00:23:09,294 --> 00:23:12,494
You, by any chance,
recognize the jacket?

426
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,427
It's not Caleb's.

427
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:21,093
You can try and deny it,
but...

428
00:23:21,127 --> 00:23:23,427
No.

429
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,294
You don't understand.

430
00:23:27,961 --> 00:23:30,961
That jacket belongs
to my other son.

431
00:23:49,994 --> 00:23:52,994
 

432
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:59,561
And out of nowhere,
he just attacked me.

433
00:23:59,594 --> 00:24:01,727
My brother's
never been violent.

434
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:04,227
I'm sure he didn't mean
to hurt you.

435
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,694
But he did.

436
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:10,961
Let me just take you home.

437
00:24:15,761 --> 00:24:18,227
This has been
pretty traumatic for me.

438
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,227
I-I-I think that you should
come over for the next few days

439
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,227
So we can talk it out.

440
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,294
We broke up, Mel. It is not
my job to hold your hand.

441
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,994
Well, maybe I shouldn't
go home right away.

442
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,327
Maybe I should go
to the cops first.

443
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,561
The cops?

444
00:24:36,594 --> 00:24:38,494
I was attacked.

445
00:24:38,527 --> 00:24:41,527
It's my civic duty to report it,
don't you think?

446
00:24:41,561 --> 00:24:43,527
Mel, I just told you

447
00:24:43,561 --> 00:24:46,594
that Caleb did not mean
to do what he did, okay?

448
00:24:46,627 --> 00:24:48,127
Melanie, please.
- Screw you.

449
00:24:48,127 --> 00:24:50,427
no, you cannot tell anybody
about this!

450
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,961
I can tell who I want! Get your hands off of me!
We're talking about my brother here!

451
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:56,961
Your brother is going to go
to jail for the next ten years,

452
00:24:56,994 --> 00:24:59,727
so I say let go!

453
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,761
Hey, Melanie!

454
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,060
What?!

455
00:25:06,193 --> 00:25:10,028
You leave my family alone!
Uhh!

456
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:49,304
<i>we all met Lynette Scavo</i>

457
00:25:49,337 --> 00:25:51,304
<i>the day</i>
<i>she moved onto Wisteria Lane.</i>

458
00:25:51,337 --> 00:25:54,837
<i>we quickly decided</i>
<i>she would be our friend,</i>

459
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:58,937
<i>mostly because we were</i>
<i>afraid to have her as an enemy.</i>

460
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,638
...playing Russian roulette with my ovaries and--
- Lynette!

461
00:26:04,803 --> 00:26:06,237
Hi.
- Hi.

462
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:08,237
Hi. Uh, we just
wanted to come

463
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:10,237
welcome you
to the neighborhood.

464
00:26:10,271 --> 00:26:13,738
Um, but we could
come back later.
- Yeah.

465
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,070
No, wait. Actually, wait.
This is perfect.

466
00:26:16,104 --> 00:26:18,638
You know why? Because we need
some impartial judges.
- Lynette...

467
00:26:18,671 --> 00:26:21,170
Let's suppose your husband
begged you to get pregnant--

468
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,104
begged you--and out
of the goodness of your heart,

469
00:26:23,137 --> 00:26:25,704
you agreed, even though
it might derail your career.

470
00:26:25,738 --> 00:26:27,704
You agreed to a baby.
<i>A</i> baby, singular.

471
00:26:27,738 --> 00:26:29,671
Lynette, we've just met
these people.

472
00:26:29,704 --> 00:26:31,903
Then--then you go in
for an ultrasound,

473
00:26:31,937 --> 00:26:33,903
and you hear
two heartbeats.

474
00:26:33,937 --> 00:26:36,404
Then and only then does
your husband tell you

475
00:26:36,437 --> 00:26:38,404
that twins run
in his family.

476
00:26:38,437 --> 00:26:40,571
I didn't think
it was that big a deal!

477
00:26:40,604 --> 00:26:42,571
Your family had
eight sets of twins

478
00:26:42,604 --> 00:26:44,004
over three generations,

479
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:45,970
not to mention your relatives
in Kentucky with triplets!

480
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,271
Triplets! So I ask you,

481
00:26:48,304 --> 00:26:51,671
do I not deserve to punish
this man severely?

482
00:26:51,704 --> 00:26:53,170
Well, actually, I think

483
00:26:53,204 --> 00:26:56,970
that twins are genetically
determined by the mother.

484
00:26:57,004 --> 00:26:59,004
What are you,
a scientist?

485
00:26:59,037 --> 00:27:02,604
No. No,
I write children's books.

486
00:27:02,638 --> 00:27:05,803
Um, we, uh, just came over
to introduce ourselves,

487
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:09,004
but we can, um,
do that at another time.

488
00:27:09,037 --> 00:27:10,803
No, wait. Please stay.
It's okay.

489
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,803
We're okay.
We're okay, right?

490
00:27:12,837 --> 00:27:16,571
Honey, we don't wanna
freak out the new neighbors.

491
00:27:16,604 --> 00:27:19,037
I'm sorry that you saw
my panic attack.

492
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,704
I won't
let it happen again,

493
00:27:21,738 --> 00:27:24,204
especially since this is
my last pregnancy.

494
00:27:24,237 --> 00:27:27,638
Right. You're the boss.
I'm just your love slave.

495
00:27:27,671 --> 00:27:29,738
Aw.

496
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,237
Well, don't encourage him.

497
00:27:31,271 --> 00:27:33,738
Honey, clearly, our new neighbors consent

498
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:38,404
that you have been gifted
with a phenomenal husband.

499
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:41,571
  Cannonball!

500
00:27:41,604 --> 00:27:42,903
Guys?

501
00:27:42,937 --> 00:27:44,870
Could you come here
for a second?

502
00:27:44,903 --> 00:27:47,537
We need to have
a serious talk.

503
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:56,337
Okay, we have had
a great... vacation,

504
00:27:56,371 --> 00:27:58,704
but tomorrow
we're going home.

505
00:27:58,738 --> 00:28:03,537
Except we're not going
to <i>our</i> home.

506
00:28:03,571 --> 00:28:06,537
We're gonna go stay
with grandma.

507
00:28:06,571 --> 00:28:09,671
Is Dad
gonna be there?

508
00:28:09,704 --> 00:28:11,671
No, Dad is not
gonna be there,

509
00:28:11,704 --> 00:28:16,437
but he--he is gonna come
and see you guys all the time.

510
00:28:16,471 --> 00:28:19,937
We are still
gonna be a family.

511
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,271
It's just...

512
00:28:23,304 --> 00:28:28,004
We won't be living
in the same place anymore.

513
00:28:28,037 --> 00:28:31,837
So...

514
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,704
Is there any questions
you wanna ask me?

515
00:28:37,404 --> 00:28:39,237
Can we go
swimming now?

516
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,803
  Cannonball!

517
00:29:08,937 --> 00:29:10,638
Mike, what a surprise.

518
00:29:10,671 --> 00:29:13,504
Yeah. How's it goin'?

519
00:29:13,537 --> 00:29:15,170
Good, good. I'm...

520
00:29:15,204 --> 00:29:20,170
just came in to get
a new battery for my watch.

521
00:29:20,204 --> 00:29:23,237
So... Whatcha doin'?

522
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:25,237
Oh, just buying something
for my grandma.

523
00:29:25,271 --> 00:29:26,738
It's her 90th birthday.

524
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,070
Here we go.

525
00:29:28,104 --> 00:29:30,137
This will sweep her
right off her feet.

526
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:34,937
It's elegant, and she can
build on it for anniversaries.

527
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,803
Lucky grandma.  

528
00:29:37,837 --> 00:29:40,837
You dog. You're gonna ask
Susan to marry you, aren't you?

529
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,137
I didn't say that.
- Man, I'm cool.

530
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,070
As far as I'm concerned,
Susan's old news, so...

531
00:29:46,104 --> 00:29:47,604
Mazel tov.

532
00:29:47,638 --> 00:29:49,604
I don't suppose
there's any hope

533
00:29:49,638 --> 00:29:52,437
of you keeping your mouth shut
about this, is there?

534
00:29:52,471 --> 00:29:55,437
I wanted to surprise her.
- Oh, trust me, brother.
She'll be surprised,

535
00:29:55,471 --> 00:29:58,770
and not just
by how small that rock is.

536
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,404
  look, I-I know
it's an expensive car,

537
00:30:07,437 --> 00:30:10,870
but I need one,
so can I get the money?

538
00:30:13,371 --> 00:30:15,870
You're a lousy liar, kid.
I read the papers.

539
00:30:15,903 --> 00:30:18,870
I know what happened
to your father.

540
00:30:18,903 --> 00:30:23,537
My guess is he's in the market
for a fancy lawyer

541
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:26,970
to get him
some rich man's justice.

542
00:30:27,004 --> 00:30:28,671
Please.

543
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:32,504
Paul Young put Deirdre
in a box.

544
00:30:32,537 --> 00:30:34,638
My daughter. Your mother.

545
00:30:36,504 --> 00:30:38,271
So we're clear,

546
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:41,704
I don't write checks
to monsters.

547
00:30:41,738 --> 00:30:44,638
  Why can't you
just give me the money?

548
00:30:44,671 --> 00:30:46,970
You're dying.
You don't need it. I do.

549
00:30:47,004 --> 00:30:50,104
Don't cry, Zach.
It pisses me off.

550
00:30:50,137 --> 00:30:53,237
Well, you said all of this
was gonna be mine,

551
00:30:53,271 --> 00:30:55,337
so when do I get it?!

552
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:57,337
"Empire" is
a highfalutin word,

553
00:30:57,371 --> 00:30:59,837
but that's what I've built.

554
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,237
Unfortunately...

555
00:31:02,271 --> 00:31:07,903
an empire can only be ruled
by an iron fist

556
00:31:07,937 --> 00:31:11,070
and a strong gut.

557
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:14,170
I wanted to give it to you,
Zach,

558
00:31:14,204 --> 00:31:17,237
But I'm starting to have
my doubts about you.

559
00:31:17,271 --> 00:31:21,271
So what?

560
00:31:21,304 --> 00:31:22,970
Are you cutting me off?

561
00:31:23,004 --> 00:31:26,803
I don't have any use
for weakness.

562
00:31:29,271 --> 00:31:31,371
Get out.

563
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,170
What, are you gonna kill me?

564
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:20,504
Prove you're a tough guy?

565
00:32:23,571 --> 00:32:25,704
See?
That's why I can't give you

566
00:32:25,738 --> 00:32:27,738
the keys to the kingdom,
kid.

567
00:32:30,004 --> 00:32:32,471
No balls.

568
00:33:10,754 --> 00:33:15,587
<i>we met Gabrielle Solis the day</i>
<i>she moved to Wisteria Lane.</i>

569
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:18,087
<i>we were all excited</i>
<i>to get a glimpse</i>

570
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,054
<i>of a successful new york model.</i>

571
00:33:22,354 --> 00:33:23,321
Hello?

572
00:33:23,354 --> 00:33:25,120
<i>we saw more...</i>

573
00:33:25,154 --> 00:33:27,154
Hi there.

574
00:33:27,187 --> 00:33:29,987
<i>than we bargained for.</i>

575
00:33:31,987 --> 00:33:33,521
I'm Mary Alice.

576
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:34,587
Hi.

577
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:36,987
This is Susan,
uh, Lynette and Bree.

578
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,953
Welcome
to the neighborhood.

579
00:33:38,987 --> 00:33:40,754
Well, I am Gabrielle Solis.

580
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:44,254
Would it be better
if we came back at another time?

581
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:46,621
Oh! No, no. I was...

582
00:33:46,654 --> 00:33:49,287
just changing
out of my sweaty clothes.

583
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:52,754
I didn't realize
moving was such great cardio.

584
00:33:52,788 --> 00:33:57,120
Hey, babe, we haven't tried it
in the kitchen yet.

585
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:02,788
Honey, uh, I think it's time
to unpack the pants.

586
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,587
Right.

587
00:34:05,621 --> 00:34:07,621
It's nice to meet you ladies.

588
00:34:09,354 --> 00:34:12,220
Let me guess--newlyweds?

589
00:34:12,254 --> 00:34:13,688
Four months,

590
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:17,987
and I've dressed like this
for two of 'em.  

591
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,087
He's insatiable.

592
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,987
Hey, what are you doing?

593
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,220
Now?
Babe, it's kind of late.

594
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:40,920
You don't wanna have sex
with me?

595
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,987
You always wanna have sex
with me.

596
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,987
You wanted to have sex
with me

597
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,987
an hour
after your hernia operation.

598
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,421
I'm a little preoccupied.

599
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,154
A good man died today.

600
00:34:52,187 --> 00:34:54,321
Don't take it personally.

601
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,788
Xiao-mei said
the strangest thing to me.

602
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,788
When I told her
you were dead,

603
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,321
she said,
"Please don't kill him."

604
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,487
That poor kid.

605
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:21,654
Oh. We really need to get her
some English lessons.

606
00:35:27,154 --> 00:35:32,220
 

607
00:35:32,254 --> 00:35:34,920
Julie,
what are you doing?

608
00:35:34,953 --> 00:35:36,688
I'm trying to sleep.

609
00:35:36,721 --> 00:35:38,521
Morning, ladies.

610
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:41,554
Karl! What are you doing?

611
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:44,554
I've got a little surprise
planned for my girls.

612
00:35:44,587 --> 00:35:48,087
So just sit back and relax.
We'll be there shortly.

613
00:35:51,987 --> 00:35:55,953
No, no, no, no.
No, turn my house around.

614
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,120
Latte?

615
00:36:04,054 --> 00:36:06,054
  out to the right,
ladies.

616
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:11,654
My gift to you.

617
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:15,054
You bought us a house?

618
00:36:15,087 --> 00:36:18,354
Let's have a look around.
There's three bedrooms,

619
00:36:18,387 --> 00:36:20,354
a gourmet kitchen...
for what it's worth.

620
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:22,354
There's a guest house
in the back

621
00:36:22,387 --> 00:36:24,820
that you could use as a studio.
There's a pool.

622
00:36:24,853 --> 00:36:26,321
A pool? Really? Aah!

623
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,688
What's the catch?

624
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:31,853
There's no catch.
It's yours, Susie.

625
00:36:31,887 --> 00:36:35,287
Yours and Julie's,
no strings attached.

626
00:36:35,321 --> 00:36:38,120
 
I can't accept this.

627
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,953
I just--I gotta get out
of this mess on my own.

628
00:36:40,987 --> 00:36:43,020
This is not charity.

629
00:36:43,054 --> 00:36:44,987
I owe you...

630
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,487
for everything I've done
over the years,

631
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:50,920
for all the heartache
I've inflicted on you.

632
00:36:50,953 --> 00:36:52,820
Consider it payback.

633
00:36:52,853 --> 00:36:55,587
Mom!

634
00:36:55,621 --> 00:36:57,754
There's a pool <i>and</i> a jacuzzi!

635
00:36:57,788 --> 00:37:00,254
At least no one
can drive off with it

636
00:37:00,287 --> 00:37:02,887
while you're sleeping, huh?

637
00:37:06,887 --> 00:37:08,387
<i>hey, it's Susan.</i>

638
00:37:08,421 --> 00:37:11,387
<i>just wanted you to know I let</i>
<i>the electrician in your house.</i>

639
00:37:11,421 --> 00:37:13,920
<i>I hope you're having</i>
<i>a great time at the spa.</i>

640
00:37:15,321 --> 00:37:16,788
<i>Bree, hi. It's Betty.</i>

641
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,287
<i>I'm--I'm sorry to leave this</i>
<i>on the machine,</i>

642
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:21,788
<i>but the police have evidence</i>
<i>that implicates Matthew</i>

643
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,788
<i>in the murder</i>
<i>of Melanie foster.</i>

644
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,788
<i>we have to find them, Bree.</i>

645
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,688
<i>we have to find them</i>
<i>and get Danielle back.</i>

646
00:37:34,887 --> 00:37:37,321
  you let go of me
right now!
- Hey, hey!

647
00:37:37,354 --> 00:37:41,087
What's going on here?
- I am trying to leave,
and these morons won't let me.

648
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,853
Do you know that you can be
arrested for kidnapping,

649
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,521
for detaining someone?!
- Why do you need to leave?

650
00:37:46,554 --> 00:37:49,454
Because my daughter is in danger.
Something happened at cheerleading camp.

651
00:37:49,487 --> 00:37:51,454
Okay, there's no camp.
That was a fib on my part.

652
00:37:51,487 --> 00:37:53,721
I found out that she ran away
with a boy,

653
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:56,454
and the boy is a murderer.
A murderer?

654
00:37:56,487 --> 00:37:59,254
I can tell by your tone
that you don't believe me.

655
00:37:59,287 --> 00:38:02,187
Bree, let's talk about this
in my office.

656
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,054
I don't have time for therapy,
you quack!

657
00:38:04,087 --> 00:38:06,554
Now let me out of here!
Let go of me!

658
00:38:06,587 --> 00:38:08,554
You idiot, let go of me!

659
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:10,554
You know that I
committed myself voluntarily!

660
00:38:10,587 --> 00:38:13,120
You can't do this to me!
No!

661
00:38:13,154 --> 00:38:14,953
Bree, please, don't struggle.

662
00:38:18,654 --> 00:38:21,621
If anything happens
to my daughter,

663
00:38:21,654 --> 00:38:23,120
so help me God...

664
00:38:23,154 --> 00:38:26,454
We're only trying to help.

665
00:38:40,504 --> 00:38:44,270
Mr. Young, you'll need
to come up to the house

666
00:38:44,304 --> 00:38:46,266
to sign
some legal documents.

667
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,630
What for?

668
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,158
Noah Taylor's will called
for an immediate transference

669
00:38:50,191 --> 00:38:52,886
of his entire estate to you
upon his death.

670
00:38:55,948 --> 00:38:57,911
So everything's mine?

671
00:38:57,945 --> 00:38:59,674
That's correct.

672
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,707
Hi, Dad.

673
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,701
  so, did you have
any luck with your grandfather?

674
00:39:11,734 --> 00:39:13,697
Yeah, I talked to Noah.

675
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:15,694
He's not gonna give us
the money.

676
00:39:15,727 --> 00:39:17,190
Damn it, Zach!
Sorry?

677
00:39:17,224 --> 00:39:19,186
Go back and talk to him.

678
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,682
No, I-I don't think
he's gonna change his mind.

679
00:39:21,716 --> 00:39:23,679
Terrific.
Am I gonna see you tomorrow?

680
00:39:23,712 --> 00:39:25,708
No, I-I can't come tomorrow.

681
00:39:25,742 --> 00:39:27,205
What about Monday?

682
00:39:27,238 --> 00:39:29,201
Uh, next week's bad for me,
too.

683
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:31,763
I'll--I'll call you
when I know.
- Zach? Zach!

684
00:39:31,796 --> 00:39:34,092
Is there anything I can do?

685
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:37,818
Yeah, get me a new phone
with a different number.

686
00:39:40,313 --> 00:39:42,975
And fill in
this stupid lake.

687
00:40:06,097 --> 00:40:07,562
Careful with those.

688
00:40:07,595 --> 00:40:10,223
The last of the crystal.
- Okay.

689
00:40:10,256 --> 00:40:12,418
Hey, what's going on?

690
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,848
Oh, hi.
Um, we're just moving.

691
00:40:14,882 --> 00:40:16,878
Hey! It's the plumber.

692
00:40:16,912 --> 00:40:20,404
You come over to help Susie
move into her new house?

693
00:40:20,437 --> 00:40:21,768
New house?

694
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:24,829
Oh, she didn't tell you?
I bought a place for my girls.

695
00:40:24,863 --> 00:40:26,826
You let him buy you
a house?

696
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:28,755
Uh, well,
he's not moving in with us.

697
00:40:28,788 --> 00:40:31,383
After that speech about
wanting to go it alone,

698
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:34,344
and after I offered
to let you stay with me?

699
00:40:34,378 --> 00:40:36,840
To be fair,
you just had a spare room,

700
00:40:36,874 --> 00:40:38,569
and this is a whole house.

701
00:40:38,604 --> 00:40:40,067
  Hey, no offense,

702
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,194
if you're not using your back,
you're just in the way.

703
00:40:43,228 --> 00:40:45,490
You saw me
buying that ring,

704
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:47,619
and you just had
to cut me off.

705
00:40:47,652 --> 00:40:49,648
You bought me a ring?

706
00:40:49,683 --> 00:40:51,612
Suze, let me handle this.

707
00:40:51,645 --> 00:40:54,040
A man's gotta protect
his family.

708
00:40:54,073 --> 00:40:56,669
Uh, Mike, about that ring...
- Put that box down.

709
00:40:56,702 --> 00:40:59,830
What, you gonna hit me,
huh?

710
00:40:59,863 --> 00:41:01,492
  stop it! Oh, my...

711
00:41:02,956 --> 00:41:05,784
What are you--
just stop it! Oh, that's enough!

712
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:10,142
Just get off! Get off! Go! Go!
Oh, my God.

713
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:13,370
What? Stop! That's enough.
Enough, enough. Back up.

714
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:17,762
And that ring--
that was for me, right?
- Not now.

715
00:41:17,796 --> 00:41:19,625
  oh, my...

716
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:21,156
Ohh!

717
00:41:21,189 --> 00:41:24,316
Karl, are you okay?

718
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,678
Are you okay? Let me see.

719
00:41:26,712 --> 00:41:28,874
Oh, my God.

720
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:32,566
Whew.

721
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:35,294
  can you sit up?

722
00:41:40,852 --> 00:41:42,848
  whew.

723
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:48,270
Xiao-mei,
do you have a second?

724
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:51,264
This is probably silly,
but it's been bothering me.

725
00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:53,494
When you said,
"Please don't kill him,"

726
00:41:53,527 --> 00:41:54,990
did you mean Carlos?

727
00:41:55,025 --> 00:41:58,751
Ralph dead, not Mr. Solis.

728
00:41:58,784 --> 00:42:02,609
I know. It's just,
you said "kill," not "dead."

729
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:05,771
And I'd have to do be
pretty angry to kill someone,

730
00:42:05,805 --> 00:42:07,767
so I guess my question is,

731
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:10,728
do I have a reason
to be angry at Mr. Solis?

732
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,552
Please, so much laundry.

733
00:42:19,811 --> 00:42:21,108
Xiao-mei...

734
00:42:22,938 --> 00:42:26,099
how did you rip
your panties?

735
00:42:30,457 --> 00:42:32,985
I fall down.

736
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:37,211
Says here Dr. Bader
examined Xiao-mei last week,

737
00:42:37,244 --> 00:42:39,340
and everything was fine.

738
00:42:39,374 --> 00:42:40,837
Yeah, I know.

739
00:42:40,871 --> 00:42:43,333
It's just, she's been
having pain... down there.

740
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:45,363
So if you could take a peek,

741
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,359
it'd make me feel
so much better.

742
00:42:47,392 --> 00:42:48,357
Of course.

743
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:50,353
 
Um, and, Doctor, uh,

744
00:42:50,387 --> 00:42:51,850
while you're down there,

745
00:42:51,883 --> 00:42:53,846
could you check
if she's still a virgin?

746
00:42:53,879 --> 00:42:55,775
I'm sorry?

747
00:42:55,809 --> 00:42:58,004
You don't even have
to say it out loud.

748
00:42:58,038 --> 00:43:00,667
If you see hymen,
just give me a thumbs up.

749
00:43:33,438 --> 00:43:33,471
 

750
00:43:41,755 --> 00:43:43,219
What's this now?

751
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:44,716
I wanna swim.

752
00:43:44,749 --> 00:43:47,211
Well, we already swam.
Now it's time to pack.

753
00:43:47,246 --> 00:43:50,373
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on?

754
00:43:50,406 --> 00:43:52,503
Dad would let me swim.

755
00:43:52,536 --> 00:43:54,499
 
Well, Dad's not here,

756
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:58,690
so I decide,
and I decide no.

757
00:44:02,383 --> 00:44:04,346
Oh, Porter,
what are you doing?

758
00:44:04,379 --> 00:44:05,543
Hey!

759
00:44:05,578 --> 00:44:08,139
Hey, get down off that
right now. I mean it!

760
00:44:08,172 --> 00:44:10,800
Okay! Okay, okay, Porter,
just stop, all right?

761
00:44:10,834 --> 00:44:14,060
Just come on inside, and we'll
forget the whole thing.

762
00:44:14,095 --> 00:44:16,323
Aah!
Aah! No!

763
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:26,071
  Daddy!

764
00:44:26,105 --> 00:44:27,469
Daddy!
Daddy!

765
00:44:27,502 --> 00:44:32,259
Hey, guys. God! Ooh, God,
I've missed you so much.

766
00:44:32,293 --> 00:44:34,821
Oh, you, too, munchkin.

767
00:44:39,578 --> 00:44:41,541
Where's Porter?
Is he okay?

768
00:44:41,575 --> 00:44:44,204
He broke his arm.
They took him up to X-ray.

769
00:44:44,237 --> 00:44:48,129
Hey, guys, why don't you look
after your sister for me, okay?

770
00:44:48,163 --> 00:44:50,159
Mommy and Daddy
need to talk.

771
00:44:52,653 --> 00:44:55,116
I've got nothing to say
to you.

772
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,113
I just called
because I had to.

773
00:44:57,146 --> 00:44:59,142
Honey, whatever you saw,
I can explain it.

774
00:44:59,175 --> 00:45:00,638
I am not interested,

775
00:45:00,672 --> 00:45:02,634
and if you wanna
keep those fingers,

776
00:45:02,668 --> 00:45:05,163
I would move 'em away from my b

777
00:45:06,494 --> 00:45:08,756
Lynette,
I am not cheating on you.

778
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,353
I never have,
and I never will.

779
00:45:11,386 --> 00:45:13,814
I saw you
with that woman.

780
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:16,808
Her name is Nora. I met her 12 years ago.
- I don't care what her name is.

781
00:45:16,842 --> 00:45:19,903
I met her before you. She was
a dancer on a cruise ship.

782
00:45:19,936 --> 00:45:21,765
We had a one night stand.

783
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:24,492
I haven't thought about her in years.
- Then why are you
going to Atlantic City

784
00:45:24,527 --> 00:45:27,920
every other weekend to visit her?
-  

785
00:45:27,954 --> 00:45:32,112
I have another child,
Lynette.

786
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:34,840
What?

787
00:45:34,874 --> 00:45:37,002
She got pregnant
from the one night stand.

788
00:45:37,037 --> 00:45:39,332
Nora raised the kid
without ever telling me.

789
00:45:39,366 --> 00:45:41,329
I only just found out
about it.

790
00:45:41,362 --> 00:45:43,757
That is why I have been
going back and forth.

791
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:45,753
I am not having an affair.

792
00:45:48,514 --> 00:45:50,410
Uhh!

793
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:03,287
The little girl's name
is Kayla.

794
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,581
She's 11 years old.

795
00:46:05,616 --> 00:46:08,543
I know I should've told you
about this sooner.

796
00:46:08,576 --> 00:46:11,537
It's just that I wanted to take
a paternity test to be sure,

797
00:46:11,571 --> 00:46:13,667
and I'm definitely the Dad.

798
00:46:16,994 --> 00:46:19,754
Why did she wait so long
to contact you?

799
00:46:19,789 --> 00:46:22,251
She said she wanted
to raise the kid alone,

800
00:46:22,284 --> 00:46:26,541
and I... I guess
she's changed her mind, honey.

801
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:30,534
Baby, I am so sorry.

802
00:46:30,569 --> 00:46:32,531
Not ready for that yet.

803
00:46:32,565 --> 00:46:33,895
Okay.

804
00:46:35,525 --> 00:46:39,052
You have no idea how badly
you scared me.

805
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:42,345
I am so sorry.

806
00:46:42,379 --> 00:46:45,008
I had already let you go.

807
00:46:50,397 --> 00:46:53,159
Dad! I got a blue cast.

808
00:46:53,193 --> 00:46:57,085
Hey, buddy. You sure did.
That's pretty cool.

809
00:47:01,743 --> 00:47:04,637
Hey.

810
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:07,731
It itches.
Can we go home now?

811
00:47:15,516 --> 00:47:18,310
Yeah. We're going home.

812
00:47:28,907 --> 00:47:30,804
Have they rung up
your prescription yet?

813
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:32,834
No, they're getting it
right now.

814
00:47:32,866 --> 00:47:34,330
Good. Add that on.

815
00:47:34,365 --> 00:47:36,827
You're dying your hair
honey wheat blond?

816
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:38,955
Oh, it's not for me.

817
00:47:38,988 --> 00:47:41,849
It's for Danielle.

818
00:47:41,882 --> 00:47:45,276
That hair is going back
to the color God intended.

819
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:47,539
You actually think
she's gonna sit still

820
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,536
as you towel this
through her hair?

821
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:52,030
Oh, I will tie her down
if necessary.

822
00:47:52,064 --> 00:47:54,626
I'm also thinking of checking
her body for piercings

823
00:47:54,659 --> 00:47:56,288
While I'm at it.
- You're overreacting.

824
00:47:56,323 --> 00:47:58,319
She's just going through
a phase.

825
00:47:58,352 --> 00:48:00,315
That's what
girls her age do.

826
00:48:00,348 --> 00:48:02,842
They also get pregnant
and become drug addicts.

827
00:48:02,877 --> 00:48:05,605
And that color hair
is the gateway.

828
00:48:07,201 --> 00:48:10,095
Would you please, uh,
add that to our bill?

829
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:11,594
I'm telling you, Bree,

830
00:48:11,627 --> 00:48:13,623
You're gonna have to
stop riding 'em so hard.

831
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:17,515
I am trying to ensure that they
turn into responsible adults.

832
00:48:17,549 --> 00:48:20,011
Trust me, Rex,
in the end,

833
00:48:20,044 --> 00:48:21,973
we will be rewarded.

834
00:48:22,007 --> 00:48:24,569
How can you be so damn sure
of yourself all the time?

835
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:26,498
Why is my certainty a flaw?

836
00:48:26,532 --> 00:48:28,994
I know what I'm about,
I know my values,

837
00:48:29,027 --> 00:48:30,657
and I know what's right.

838
00:48:30,691 --> 00:48:32,654
Why shouldn't I stay
the course?

839
00:48:32,687 --> 00:48:35,215
Am I right,
Mr. Williams?

840
00:48:35,249 --> 00:48:37,810
My mother always took
a firm hand with me,

841
00:48:37,843 --> 00:48:39,806
and I thank her for it.

842
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,766
Exactly, and look how well
you turned out.

843
00:48:42,801 --> 00:48:44,564
 

844
00:48:46,062 --> 00:48:49,255
Look, you're a good mother,
but there's a limit.

845
00:48:49,288 --> 00:48:51,749
You have got to relinquish
some control,

846
00:48:51,784 --> 00:48:53,780
or else
you're gonna regret it.

847
00:49:11,613 --> 00:49:14,740
Excuse me.
Do you have the time?

848
00:49:14,773 --> 00:49:17,934
Yeah, it's just after 8:00.
- Oh, I was afraid of that.

849
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:19,398
Afraid of what?

850
00:49:19,431 --> 00:49:22,392
Well, I'm only supposed
to be restrained until 7:00.

851
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,754
You see, I have a problem
with sleepwalking.

852
00:49:24,787 --> 00:49:27,150
They just tie me up
so that I don't wander off

853
00:49:27,184 --> 00:49:28,647
and hurt myself.

854
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,542
Yeah, well, I'm sure a nurse
will be in here soon.

855
00:49:31,575 --> 00:49:33,038
One can only hope.

856
00:49:33,072 --> 00:49:35,467
Of course, if a doctor
gets here first

857
00:49:35,502 --> 00:49:39,027
and sees that someone
forgot to release me,

858
00:49:39,061 --> 00:49:41,689
I'm sure they'd get
in a lot of trouble.

859
00:49:41,722 --> 00:49:44,351
Lady, I can't let you
out of your restraints.

860
00:49:44,384 --> 00:49:45,848
I'd get fired.

861
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:48,608
Oh. Well, I certainly would not
want that to happen.

862
00:49:52,668 --> 00:49:54,132
What's your name?

863
00:49:54,165 --> 00:49:55,362
Alfred.

864
00:49:55,397 --> 00:49:57,293
Oh! Does anybody ever
call you "Alfie"?

865
00:49:57,326 --> 00:49:58,889
No.

866
00:49:58,923 --> 00:50:02,283
And why should they?

867
00:50:04,547 --> 00:50:06,608
So, um, Alfred,

868
00:50:06,642 --> 00:50:10,135
I was wondering if you could
maybe loosen my restraints.

869
00:50:10,169 --> 00:50:11,931
They're incredibly tight,

870
00:50:11,965 --> 00:50:14,428
and I'm sure
there are no rules

871
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:16,457
against making me
more comfortable.

872
00:50:21,415 --> 00:50:23,942
Do you think I'm stupid?

873
00:50:23,976 --> 00:50:25,671
I beg your pardon?

874
00:50:25,705 --> 00:50:28,167
Two seconds after I loosen
these little restraints,

875
00:50:28,201 --> 00:50:30,264
you'll try to scratch
my eyes out

876
00:50:30,297 --> 00:50:31,993
and make a run for it.

877
00:50:32,027 --> 00:50:34,754
Well, I'm not falling for it,
you psycho little bitch.

878
00:50:34,788 --> 00:50:37,183
In fact, I hope they keep you
tied up for the next month.

879
00:50:37,218 --> 00:50:39,679
'cause I'd get a real kick
out of watching

880
00:50:39,712 --> 00:50:41,675
a prissy little whack job
like you

881
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:43,671
lying in your own filth.

882
00:50:43,704 --> 00:50:45,202
Know what I mean?

883
00:50:49,328 --> 00:50:51,324
Oh. Are you all right?

884
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:55,681
Uh, yeah. A little hopped up
on pain medicine, but, um,

885
00:50:55,716 --> 00:50:58,178
I chipped my tooth
on the salad shooter.

886
00:50:58,211 --> 00:51:00,174
Oh. Oh, you know,
you should, um,

887
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:02,336
call my friend Orson.

888
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:03,833
He's a dentist.

889
00:51:03,866 --> 00:51:06,794
I'm sure he'll see you right away.
- Thanks.

890
00:51:06,827 --> 00:51:08,956
So...

891
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:11,618
about that ring you bought--

892
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:15,377
Is there anything particular
you'd like to ask me?

893
00:51:15,412 --> 00:51:17,539
Nope,
not as long Karl's got you

894
00:51:17,573 --> 00:51:19,038
wrapped around his finger.

895
00:51:19,071 --> 00:51:20,700
Okay, that's ridiculous.

896
00:51:20,734 --> 00:51:23,063
Karl doesn't have me
wrapped around anything.

897
00:51:23,097 --> 00:51:26,291
You accepted a house from him,
and you're nuts if you believe

898
00:51:26,324 --> 00:51:28,287
he doesn't have
an ulterior motive.

899
00:51:28,321 --> 00:51:30,284
He's Karl.
He's playing me.

900
00:51:30,317 --> 00:51:32,778
But that house is gonna be
a great place

901
00:51:32,811 --> 00:51:35,307
for my daughter to live.

902
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,303
And when he makes his move,

903
00:51:37,337 --> 00:51:41,229
he's gonna realize that
<i>I</i> was really playing <i>him.</i>

904
00:51:41,263 --> 00:51:44,889
So... about that ring...

905
00:51:44,922 --> 00:51:47,351
I... I just don't want
to get deeper into this

906
00:51:47,383 --> 00:51:49,845
and suddenly realize
your heart's somewhere else.

907
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,570
Mike, my heart is
in the exact right place.

908
00:51:54,604 --> 00:51:56,866
Ugh. I can't have this conversation

909
00:51:56,899 --> 00:51:59,261
now my tooth is throbbing.

910
00:51:59,295 --> 00:52:01,956
Of course.

911
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,486
Okay.

912
00:52:05,283 --> 00:52:08,676
You don't even wanna know
what my answer would have been?

913
00:52:18,259 --> 00:52:20,222
Can we please
get out of here?

914
00:52:20,255 --> 00:52:21,718
This place is gross.

915
00:52:21,752 --> 00:52:23,681
And, God, I'm starving.

916
00:52:23,715 --> 00:52:26,111
Yeah, I know, but we don't
have any money, remember?

917
00:52:26,144 --> 00:52:28,107
That's why we should
go to my house.

918
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,136
I know the combination
to my Mom's safe.

919
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:32,166
Okay, I've told you
a thousand times,

920
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:34,660
It's way too risky. No.
- Something you should know before we embark

921
00:52:34,694 --> 00:52:36,159
on this little adventure--

922
00:52:36,192 --> 00:52:38,653
I can get pretty bitchy
when I'm not fed.

923
00:52:38,686 --> 00:52:41,480
 

924
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:47,003
Listen, I hope
I'm not out of line here,

925
00:52:47,037 --> 00:52:49,798
but did you ever spend
any time in prison?

926
00:52:49,832 --> 00:52:52,593
What, you can tell
from my teeth?

927
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:56,385
Jailhouse dentistry--
unmistakable and not pretty.

928
00:52:56,419 --> 00:52:59,379
Yeah, I did a little time
in Kansas a few years back.

929
00:52:59,414 --> 00:53:01,376
Were you a prison dentist?

930
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:05,169
Uh, during dental school,
we did freebie work

931
00:53:05,204 --> 00:53:08,098
on some of the poor guinea pigs
behind bars. No offense.

932
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:11,092
You know, I had the feeling
when I first saw you

933
00:53:11,126 --> 00:53:13,953
In the movie theater
that we'd met before.
- I don't think so.

934
00:53:13,986 --> 00:53:16,448
Oh, I'm pretty sure.
I think I know you.

935
00:53:16,481 --> 00:53:19,241
Any chance I was
one of your guinea pigs?

936
00:53:19,276 --> 00:53:22,903
No. the only prison work
I did was back in Virginia.

937
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:28,359
Diploma says you graduated
from Minnesota.

938
00:53:28,392 --> 00:53:32,284
I'm licensed
in three states.

939
00:53:32,317 --> 00:53:34,846
Open wide, please.

940
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,205
Don't talk.
I wouldn't want to hurt you.

941
00:53:44,196 --> 00:53:46,889
Carlos, you promised
you'd come home today.

942
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:49,186
Well, I don't care
what Tanaka wants!

943
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:51,648
Rattling around
this stupid house all by myself

944
00:53:51,682 --> 00:53:53,645
is not what I signed up for!

945
00:53:53,678 --> 00:53:57,403
No, no, no, don't hang up on me.
I'm not done yelling at you!

946
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:25,018
Mrs. Solis.

947
00:54:25,051 --> 00:54:26,515
How are you?

948
00:54:26,548 --> 00:54:29,476
The best you've ever had.

949
00:54:40,689 --> 00:54:43,117
What's so funny?

950
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:45,613
Me and my friend Justin
had this bet.

951
00:54:45,646 --> 00:54:47,642
See who could lose
their virginity first

952
00:54:47,675 --> 00:54:49,638
this summer at bible camp.

953
00:54:49,672 --> 00:54:52,100
Guess I beat him
to the punch.

954
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:55,294
You were a virgin?

955
00:54:55,328 --> 00:54:57,590
So it didn't show?

956
00:54:57,623 --> 00:54:59,352
Uh, no.

957
00:54:59,386 --> 00:55:01,847
No, I mean, I guess it was,
well, weird when

958
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:05,074
you started naming the American
presidents in order.

959
00:55:05,108 --> 00:55:07,171
Ah, I wish you hadn't
heard that.

960
00:55:07,205 --> 00:55:09,167
I was just trying to...

961
00:55:09,201 --> 00:55:11,828
No, no, you were good.

962
00:55:13,692 --> 00:55:16,686
Just, if it comes up in school,
Paul Revere was never president.

963
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:20,346
Oh. Thanks.

964
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,338
I, uh, had a really
awesome time, Mrs. Solis.

965
00:55:24,373 --> 00:55:26,169
Well, good. I'm glad,

966
00:55:26,202 --> 00:55:28,397
because this can
never happen again.

967
00:55:28,431 --> 00:55:29,396
Why?

968
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:31,192
The only reason I did this

969
00:55:31,226 --> 00:55:33,355
was because I was angry
at Carlos.

970
00:55:33,389 --> 00:55:36,049
Now, thanks to you,
I'm not angry anymore.

971
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,711
Well, you should be.
I mean, the guy's never around.

972
00:55:38,744 --> 00:55:41,373
Hell, he's probably off having
his own affair right now.

973
00:55:41,406 --> 00:55:44,567
Oh.  
I seriously doubt that.

974
00:55:44,601 --> 00:55:46,563
How do you know?

975
00:55:46,598 --> 00:55:49,558
Because Carlos doesn't have
an adulterous bone in his body.

976
00:55:49,592 --> 00:55:51,554
What we just did
he could never do.

977
00:55:51,588 --> 00:55:56,976
For him, sex isn't just sex.
It's a sign of intimacy.

978
00:55:57,010 --> 00:56:00,105
It's the way he shows love.

979
00:56:00,138 --> 00:56:03,730
You know, instead of
talking and listening

980
00:56:03,764 --> 00:56:06,525
and spending time with me.

981
00:56:10,351 --> 00:56:12,679
What was that for?

982
00:56:12,713 --> 00:56:15,475
Thought you needed a kiss.

983
00:56:17,937 --> 00:56:20,831
Well, since this is
our last time,

984
00:56:20,864 --> 00:56:23,326
I guess we can make
the most of it.

985
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:33,375
So... you really trust him,
huh?

986
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:34,905
Completely.

987
00:56:36,635 --> 00:56:38,631
<i>Like all good mothers,</i>

988
00:56:38,664 --> 00:56:44,221
<i>Gabrielle had purchased several</i>
<i>top-of-the-line baby monitors.</i>

989
00:56:44,254 --> 00:56:47,348
<i>She had planned to use them</i>
<i>to keep a close watch</i>

990
00:56:47,382 --> 00:56:49,976
<i>on her newborn child.</i>

991
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:54,533
<i>That plan was about to change.</i>

992
00:57:00,522 --> 00:57:02,485
So I'm gonna go shopping

993
00:57:02,518 --> 00:57:04,282
and then I'm gonna see
my trainer,

994
00:57:04,316 --> 00:57:06,777
and I'll definitely be gone
for, like, three hours.

995
00:57:10,005 --> 00:57:12,899
Okay. Well, I gotta go.
Have fun.

996
00:57:21,582 --> 00:57:23,047
<i>  not later, Penny.</i>

997
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,708
<i>Mommy's gotta change you now</i>
<i>'cause you stink.</i>

998
00:57:30,034 --> 00:57:32,827
<i> </i>
<i>Here, taste this.</i>

999
00:57:32,862 --> 00:57:34,524
<i>  Oh, man!</i>

1000
00:57:34,558 --> 00:57:36,421
<i>Xiao-mei,</i>
<i>that is amazing.</i>

1001
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:37,752
<i>You like?</i>

1002
00:57:37,786 --> 00:57:40,382
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>Sorry if I'm making a mess.</i>

1003
00:57:40,414 --> 00:57:44,839
<i>It's okay. Mu shun pork</i>
<i>supposed to be messy.</i>

1004
00:57:44,872 --> 00:57:46,835
<i>I wish Gabrielle could</i>
<i>cook like this.</i>

1005
00:57:46,868 --> 00:57:48,831
<i>Have you ever tried</i>
<i>her enchiladas?</i>

1006
00:57:48,864 --> 00:57:52,025
<i>One time</i>
<i>they make me sick.</i>

1007
00:58:00,709 --> 00:58:02,705
Ugh. He will,
and he'll meet you

1008
00:58:02,738 --> 00:58:05,167
for a romantic
motor home rendezvous,

1009
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,163
and you'll propose,
he'll accept,

1010
00:58:07,197 --> 00:58:09,692
and you'll both live
happily ever after.

1011
00:58:09,725 --> 00:58:12,120
You really think
that's what's gonna happen?

1012
00:58:12,154 --> 00:58:14,217
It's my deepest hope.

1013
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,544
Oh, there he is.

1014
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,363
We're in.

1015
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,966
POLLY? THAT'S A GOOD NAME.

1016
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,300
NO WAY.

1017
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,967
PAMELA.

1018
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,467
I said I wanted Penny.

1019
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,467
Oh, Lynette...

1020
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:49,367
eight hours
of grueling labor.

1021
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,866
That's not fair.

1022
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,367
Neither are stretch marks,
but what are you gonna do?

1023
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,400
I've only known one Penny
in my whole life,

1024
00:58:56,434 --> 00:58:58,667
And she was a slut.
- Isn't your aunt named Penny?

1025
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,334
Yeah, that's her.

1026
00:59:00,367 --> 00:59:03,866
Our daughter
is officially named.

1027
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,400
You may go now.

1028
00:59:05,434 --> 00:59:08,100
All right,
I'll let you win this one,

1029
00:59:08,133 --> 00:59:10,600
but I get to name
the next one.

1030
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:13,701
You promised me
we'd stop at four.

1031
00:59:13,734 --> 00:59:15,701
Remember?
You wanted four kids,

1032
00:59:15,734 --> 00:59:19,267
I wanted one, and somehow
we compromised on four.

1033
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,267
Can we please stop now?

1034
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,933
Lynette, you're hurting me.

1035
00:59:22,966 --> 00:59:25,767
I will stop
as soon as you promise.

1036
00:59:25,801 --> 00:59:28,067
Okay, I promise.

1037
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,701
Okay.

1038
00:59:32,767 --> 00:59:35,200
Honey, I...
I didn't mean to upset ya.

1039
00:59:35,233 --> 00:59:36,434
It's just...

1040
00:59:36,467 --> 00:59:38,033
We've been so happy.

1041
00:59:38,067 --> 00:59:40,067
Sweetie, sometimes when
you're at work,

1042
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,567
and I'm home alone
with three young boys,

1043
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,600
I'm not so happy,

1044
00:59:44,634 --> 00:59:47,634
and now I'm gonna be alone
with four kids.

1045
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,200
Each one is a blessing,
yes,

1046
00:59:50,233 --> 00:59:55,000
but I don't think I can
take any more... blessings.

1047
00:59:55,033 --> 00:59:58,567
More blessings could make me
lose my mind.

1048
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,334
Do you understand?

1049
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:01,734
Yeah.

1050
01:00:01,767 --> 01:00:04,067
Thank you.

1051
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,334
Honey, that really hurt.

1052
01:00:08,367 --> 01:00:10,400
Did it hurt for eight hours?

1053
01:00:10,434 --> 01:00:12,200
No.

1054
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:13,966
Okay, then.

1055
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:23,000
I must have been crazy,
agreeing to this.

1056
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:25,000
Honey, you're gonna feel
differently

1057
01:00:25,033 --> 01:00:26,500
once you meet Kayla.

1058
01:00:26,534 --> 01:00:28,500
She is sweet,
smart little girl,

1059
01:00:28,534 --> 01:00:31,500
plus it'll help you get past
your resentment of Nora.

1060
01:00:31,534 --> 01:00:32,534
I don't...

1061
01:00:32,567 --> 01:00:34,434
Well, here goes.

1062
01:00:38,866 --> 01:00:40,300
Hey, you!

1063
01:00:53,467 --> 01:00:56,534
You must be Lynette.
And you must be Nora.

1064
01:00:56,567 --> 01:00:58,534
I guess it'd be weird
if we hugged.

1065
01:00:58,567 --> 01:01:00,900
Probably.

1066
01:01:00,933 --> 01:01:03,033
Wh-where's Kayla?

1067
01:01:03,067 --> 01:01:04,500
Oh, she didn't come.

1068
01:01:04,534 --> 01:01:07,067
We got into this huge fight,
and I was, like...

1069
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,534
I just couldn't stand
to look at her face

1070
01:01:09,567 --> 01:01:12,534
on that long plane trip, so I
dumped her at the neighbors'.

1071
01:01:12,567 --> 01:01:14,667
But, hey, come on,
you got me.

1072
01:01:24,067 --> 01:01:26,434
So, anyway,
Kayla is doing great.

1073
01:01:26,467 --> 01:01:29,100
She's so pretty.
She's so smart.

1074
01:01:29,133 --> 01:01:32,200
She's practically a star
on her soccer team.

1075
01:01:32,233 --> 01:01:34,267
I have the cutest picture.

1076
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,267
You know,
we wouldn't need a picture

1077
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:39,300
if you had actually
brought her like you promised.

1078
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:42,667
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

1079
01:01:42,701 --> 01:01:45,167
You know, but I just
haven't had much time

1080
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,866
to get away on my own since,
um, I've been taking care

1081
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,367
of your kid for
the past 11 years, Superdad!

1082
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,400
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1083
01:01:52,434 --> 01:01:55,734
I know it's been hard.
You've done an amazing job.

1084
01:01:55,767 --> 01:01:58,634
Thank you. I think, so, too.
Apology accepted.

1085
01:01:58,667 --> 01:02:00,966
Anyway, I wasn't sure
that I wanted Kayla here

1086
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,033
if we were gonna talk
about business.

1087
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:06,567
Business?

1088
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:11,467
I was hoping that we could
talk about child support

1089
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,966
Since I've got, like,
11 years coming to me, right?

1090
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,033
You never told me
I had a daughter.

1091
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,600
My lawyer thinks
that I have a very good case.

1092
01:02:19,634 --> 01:02:22,100
We can't afford this.
We have four kids.

1093
01:02:22,133 --> 01:02:25,200
Tom just lost his job.
That'd bankrupt us.

1094
01:02:25,233 --> 01:02:27,734
I'm the bad guy now
when he's the one

1095
01:02:27,767 --> 01:02:30,667
that knocked me up
and abandoned his child?

1096
01:02:30,701 --> 01:02:33,900
How could he abandon her if
he didn't even know she existed?

1097
01:02:33,933 --> 01:02:36,067
That doesn't let him
off the hook.

1098
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,833
You know, you better do right
by me unless, of course,

1099
01:02:38,866 --> 01:02:40,833
you wanna be known
as Mrs. Deadbeat Dad!

1100
01:02:40,866 --> 01:02:42,933
 
Just take it easy.

1101
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:48,667
Are we just gonna keep
talking louder?

1102
01:02:48,701 --> 01:02:50,000
Is that the plan?

1103
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:52,000
You wanna just keep
raising your voice

1104
01:02:52,033 --> 01:02:54,133
'cause that's how you get
what you want, right?

1105
01:02:54,167 --> 01:02:55,900
You make a scene,
you throw a tantrum,

1106
01:02:55,933 --> 01:02:57,900
and everyone gets scared
and backs off.

1107
01:02:57,933 --> 01:02:59,500
Well, I don't work that way,
lady.

1108
01:02:59,534 --> 01:03:02,000
I don't care that my husband
was so phenomenally stupid

1109
01:03:02,033 --> 01:03:03,801
and/or drunk to actually
have sex with you.

1110
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:06,267
I'm not gonna let it ruin
my life.

1111
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,267
 
Am I talking loud enough

1112
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:11,000
for that to get through to you?

1113
01:03:14,567 --> 01:03:17,833
I'm just gonna pay
the bill.

1114
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,267
Karl, we've been through
a lot together.

1115
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:24,701
We will always be connected
by Julie,

1116
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:27,233
but... I know why
you bought me that house,

1117
01:03:27,267 --> 01:03:29,233
And I'm not moving into it.

1118
01:03:29,267 --> 01:03:31,067
Susie, come on, I--

1119
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,033
Karl, we are not
getting back together.

1120
01:03:33,067 --> 01:03:38,866
Not ever. You need to just stop
and realize that it's over.

1121
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,734
I'm gonna marry Mike.

1122
01:03:40,767 --> 01:03:43,933
So I need you
to sign these

1123
01:03:43,966 --> 01:03:46,634
because I have to be
divorced first.

1124
01:03:48,267 --> 01:03:49,866
Mike popped the question

1125
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:52,667
No. He was going to, but then
you clocked him in the mouth

1126
01:03:52,701 --> 01:03:55,000
with a salad shooter,
remember?

1127
01:03:55,033 --> 01:03:58,701
Actually, I'm going to pop
the question to him

1128
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:00,400
tomorrow night.

1129
01:04:02,534 --> 01:04:04,434
Guess it cuts down
on the suspense

1130
01:04:04,467 --> 01:04:06,467
knowing he bought you
a ring.

1131
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:11,734
You would think so,
but, no, it doesn't.

1132
01:04:11,767 --> 01:04:14,133
This is a lot to ask

1133
01:04:14,167 --> 01:04:16,634
for a man
who still loves you, Susie.

1134
01:04:16,667 --> 01:04:19,067
I know.

1135
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:23,000
But if you really do...
love me,

1136
01:04:23,033 --> 01:04:24,701
you'll let me go.

1137
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,600
Okay, Susie.
I can do that.

1138
01:04:35,534 --> 01:04:38,500
Well, you know where to find me
if it doesn't work out.

1139
01:04:38,534 --> 01:04:41,100
Oh, shut up.

1140
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,866
I don't see another way
to make this work.

1141
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,866
We've gotta dip
into the pensions.

1142
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,866
Oh, I don't like
the sound of that.

1143
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:52,100
Well, it's that
or the kids' college fund.

1144
01:04:52,133 --> 01:04:54,167
We'll write Nora
one big check,

1145
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,667
and in return,
she'll sign away her claim

1146
01:04:56,701 --> 01:04:58,667
for the back child support.

1147
01:04:58,701 --> 01:05:01,634
If we're lucky, she'll take
the bird in the hand.

1148
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:03,734
Okay, what are we
talking about? How much?

1149
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:07,133
Well, we need to show her
we're serious.

1150
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:08,701
$30,000?

1151
01:05:08,734 --> 01:05:10,966
Are you kidding? $30,000?
If she takes you to court,

1152
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
we'll lose
and end up paying

1153
01:05:13,033 --> 01:05:14,933
11 years of child support
all at once.

1154
01:05:14,966 --> 01:05:16,933
We could lose the house.

1155
01:05:16,966 --> 01:05:20,100
Oh, we are screwed.
We are just plain screwed.
- Tom!

1156
01:05:21,966 --> 01:05:24,933
I am trying very hard
to be strong right now,

1157
01:05:24,966 --> 01:05:27,434
and you melting down
is not helping me.

1158
01:05:27,467 --> 01:05:30,334
I'm sorry.

1159
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:33,334
I know we're using up
a huge chunk of our savings,

1160
01:05:33,367 --> 01:05:36,467
but if it keeps that crazy woman
out of our life,

1161
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,233
it is the best money
we have ever spent.

1162
01:05:39,267 --> 01:05:42,200
We will be okay.

1163
01:05:43,667 --> 01:05:46,600
Hey there.

1164
01:05:46,634 --> 01:05:49,200
I was surprised to hear
you wanted a session.

1165
01:05:49,233 --> 01:05:51,701
Well, there's nothing like
being tied to a bed

1166
01:05:51,734 --> 01:05:54,300
to change a girl's mind.

1167
01:05:54,334 --> 01:05:57,167
What do you wanna
talk about?

1168
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,667
Anything at all.

1169
01:05:58,701 --> 01:06:02,767
As you said, I...
I have a lot of issues.

1170
01:06:02,801 --> 01:06:04,701
Well, I assumed as much

1171
01:06:04,734 --> 01:06:06,701
when you told
the ridiculous story

1172
01:06:06,734 --> 01:06:09,600
about your daughter
running off with a murderer.

1173
01:06:09,634 --> 01:06:12,100
Saw right through that,
did ya?

1174
01:06:12,133 --> 01:06:14,600
Well, I'm a trained
professional, Bree.

1175
01:06:14,634 --> 01:06:18,434
The human mind
is my playground.

1176
01:06:18,467 --> 01:06:20,801
Well, I'm glad
that you're having fun.

1177
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:22,801
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be flip.

1178
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:26,634
But you came here
because you were troubled,

1179
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:30,300
and then you refuse
any help we give you.

1180
01:06:30,334 --> 01:06:33,567
Things were falling apart
at home, and I just...

1181
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:37,200
I just needed a place
to rest, that's all.

1182
01:06:37,233 --> 01:06:39,900
I think there's more to it
than that.

1183
01:06:39,933 --> 01:06:40,900
Do you?

1184
01:06:40,933 --> 01:06:43,233
I think it has to do
with your kids.

1185
01:06:43,267 --> 01:06:46,467
You don't want to talk
about them.

1186
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:47,966
Why is that?

1187
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,334
Probably because
I'm ashamed.

1188
01:06:52,367 --> 01:06:54,334
Ashamed?

1189
01:06:54,367 --> 01:06:56,334
My children were my life.

1190
01:06:56,367 --> 01:06:58,933
They were the reason that
I got up in the morning,

1191
01:06:58,966 --> 01:07:00,933
So to have failed them
as a parent...

1192
01:07:00,966 --> 01:07:02,701
You think you failed them
as a parent?

1193
01:07:02,734 --> 01:07:04,167
Well, my son is a sociopath,

1194
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,133
and my daughter hates me enough
to have run away from home.

1195
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:08,900
I'm certainly not gonna get

1196
01:07:08,933 --> 01:07:12,200
"Mother of the Year" anytime soon.
- If your kids were here right now,

1197
01:07:12,233 --> 01:07:15,200
what would you tell them?
- I would beg my son Andrew
for forgiveness

1198
01:07:15,233 --> 01:07:17,200
for having given up on him,

1199
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:19,701
and I would tell my daughter
not to worry,

1200
01:07:19,734 --> 01:07:21,767
that I have a plan
to protect her.

1201
01:07:21,801 --> 01:07:25,400
And just what is that plan?

1202
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:08,113
I've got everything
ready to go--

1203
01:08:08,146 --> 01:08:10,614
flowers, candles,
Elvis Costello CD all cued up.

1204
01:08:10,647 --> 01:08:12,113
But who has the ring?
- He does.

1205
01:08:12,146 --> 01:08:14,280
So, wait, you're gonna get
down on one knee,

1206
01:08:14,313 --> 01:08:16,447
pop the question,
and while you're down there,

1207
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,447
dig in his pocket?
What if you pull out his key chain?

1208
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,380
Then I'm gonna have to find
a way to force it on my finger.
 

1209
01:08:21,413 --> 01:08:23,614
<i>  Oh, Xiao-mei, where'd</i>
<i>you learn to kiss like that?</i>

1210
01:08:23,647 --> 01:08:25,580
Sorry,
that's Penny's baby monitor.

1211
01:08:25,614 --> 01:08:27,380
It's always picking up weird frequencies.
- No, no, no! Don't turn it off.

1212
01:08:27,413 --> 01:08:31,580
<i>Ohh! move over.</i>
<i>My knees hit the dashboard.</i>

1213
01:08:31,614 --> 01:08:35,480
<i> </i>
<i>I move seat back. Better?</i>

1214
01:08:35,513 --> 01:08:37,614
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1215
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,380
Are you done
with my husband?

1216
01:09:21,647 --> 01:09:23,180
Good.

1217
01:09:26,513 --> 01:09:29,513
I have a little project
for you.

1218
01:09:29,547 --> 01:09:32,280
Okay, Gaby, can we please
talk about this?!

1219
01:09:32,313 --> 01:09:35,246
You're the one that gave me
permission, remember?

1220
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,081
You said, "Go have sex with somebody"!

1221
01:09:37,113 --> 01:09:38,814
To have meaningless sex,
Carlos,

1222
01:09:38,847 --> 01:09:41,313
not to sleep with the woman
who's carrying our child!

1223
01:09:41,347 --> 01:09:43,647
What is the matter?!
Look, we're even!

1224
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,947
You had an affair,
and I had an affair!

1225
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:48,447
I had a reason to.
You were never here!

1226
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,981
I've been here, Carlos.

1227
01:09:50,014 --> 01:09:52,914
I have tried so hard
to not be selfish

1228
01:09:52,947 --> 01:09:54,914
and to put your needs
above mine.

1229
01:09:54,947 --> 01:09:56,880
I mean, for God sakes,
look at me!

1230
01:09:56,914 --> 01:09:59,313
I have agreed to be
a mother for you!

1231
01:09:59,347 --> 01:10:01,847
Look, Gaby, you have
every right to be mad at me.

1232
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,714
So I'm gonna go
and check into a hotel room

1233
01:10:04,747 --> 01:10:07,680
and let you cool down, but we
<i>are</i> going to work this out.

1234
01:10:07,714 --> 01:10:10,213
Forget the hotel, Carlos.
Get a lease.

1235
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:21,014
I can go now, too?

1236
01:10:21,047 --> 01:10:23,614
No, you can start dinner.

1237
01:10:23,647 --> 01:10:24,680
What?!

1238
01:10:24,714 --> 01:10:28,047
You're not going anywhere,

1239
01:10:28,081 --> 01:10:31,213
not as long as you have
my baby in your belly.

1240
01:10:33,847 --> 01:10:35,914
 

1241
01:10:38,146 --> 01:10:41,113
I don't know what that meant,
but I didn't like the tone.

1242
01:10:41,146 --> 01:10:43,614
So just remember,
am the boss of you,

1243
01:10:43,647 --> 01:10:45,614
or else
I'm gonna make this

1244
01:10:45,647 --> 01:10:48,347
the worst nine months
of your life.

1245
01:10:55,413 --> 01:10:57,047
Hi.
- Hi.

1246
01:10:57,081 --> 01:10:59,347
Did you get the check?

1247
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,847
Yeah, I wanted to talk
to you about that.

1248
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,880
Do you have a minute?

1249
01:11:03,914 --> 01:11:05,880
Tom?!

1250
01:11:05,914 --> 01:11:07,880
I'm not the type of person

1251
01:11:07,914 --> 01:11:11,580
that can keep things
bottled up inside.

1252
01:11:11,614 --> 01:11:15,180
Really?
- So I'm just gonna have
to get this off my chest.

1253
01:11:15,213 --> 01:11:17,680
You made me feel really bad
about myself

1254
01:11:17,714 --> 01:11:19,981
yesterday at the restaurant.

1255
01:11:20,014 --> 01:11:23,047
My sincerest apologies.

1256
01:11:23,081 --> 01:11:25,547
You treated me
like some sort of mercenary,

1257
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,547
like the only reason
I came here

1258
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,213
was to extort money from you.

1259
01:11:29,246 --> 01:11:31,680
Well, to be honest,
first, we bought you pie,

1260
01:11:31,714 --> 01:11:33,880
then you tried
to extort money from us.

1261
01:11:33,914 --> 01:11:38,280
See? There it is again,
Lynette--that mean streak.

1262
01:11:38,313 --> 01:11:40,513
All I want is what's best for my child,

1263
01:11:40,547 --> 01:11:42,747
for Tom's child.

1264
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:45,246
As the mother of 80%
of Tom's children,

1265
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,747
I don't think
it's in their best interest

1266
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:50,547
for you to drive us
into bankruptcy.
- Of course it isn't.

1267
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,246
Here.

1268
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,847
I signed the waiver

1269
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,513
that the lawyer sent over
with the check.

1270
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:05,780
And I'm not even asking
for any back child support.

1271
01:12:05,814 --> 01:12:08,014
That's--that's--that's great.
Thank you.

1272
01:12:08,047 --> 01:12:11,180
See, Lynette? See?
It's not all about money.

1273
01:12:11,213 --> 01:12:14,780
It's not even a little bit
about money. It's about family.

1274
01:12:14,814 --> 01:12:17,981
'cause we're all
a big family now.

1275
01:12:18,014 --> 01:12:20,347
Sort of.

1276
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:23,614
Which is why I took
all the money that you gave me,

1277
01:12:23,647 --> 01:12:25,614
and I put it all down

1278
01:12:25,647 --> 01:12:28,113
on the sweetest little
2-bedroom house

1279
01:12:28,146 --> 01:12:31,981
over on Arden Drive.

1280
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,981
Ar-Arden Drive over--
over by the mall?

1281
01:12:34,014 --> 01:12:37,213
Like, five minutes
from here Arden Drive?

1282
01:12:39,113 --> 01:12:41,580
It's perfect. I could drop
Kayla off here anytime

1283
01:12:41,614 --> 01:12:43,947
so she can play
with her new siblings.

1284
01:12:43,981 --> 01:12:45,880
She can spend time
with her Dad.

1285
01:12:45,914 --> 01:12:49,814
Well, to be clear,
how are you going to live?

1286
01:12:49,847 --> 01:12:52,146
How are you going to pay
the mortgage?

1287
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:55,380
You don't have a job here.
- What is your problem
with me, lady?!

1288
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:58,113
I don't understand!
You don't know me.

1289
01:12:58,146 --> 01:12:59,880
You don't know what I can do.

1290
01:12:59,914 --> 01:13:02,647
And yet you just always,
just...  

1291
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:05,480
just--just...  

1292
01:13:05,513 --> 01:13:08,947
Always on the attack. It's ugly,
and you should work on that.

1293
01:13:11,213 --> 01:13:13,213
Here's what I think.

1294
01:13:13,246 --> 01:13:15,146
I think that we should
all work on this,

1295
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:18,146
because I don't want
every Christmas to turn ugly

1296
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:21,146
just because you and I
don't get along.

1297
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:24,847
Yeah, that would be a shame.

1298
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:16,147
See, I told you
she wasn't home.

1299
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:18,781
Her car's not even here.

1300
01:14:18,846 --> 01:14:21,347
And you said the safe
was upstairs?

1301
01:14:28,113 --> 01:14:31,547
Damn it, my mother must have
changed the combination.

1302
01:14:33,414 --> 01:14:37,880
Okay. Wait here.
I'll be right back.

1303
01:14:50,747 --> 01:14:53,247
You did it.

1304
01:14:58,946 --> 01:15:00,614
You killed Melanie.

1305
01:15:00,647 --> 01:15:03,314
You put your jacket
on her body.

1306
01:15:03,347 --> 01:15:07,080
I saw it, Matthew.

1307
01:15:07,113 --> 01:15:09,747
The police showed me
the pictures.

1308
01:15:09,781 --> 01:15:12,447
Now you weren't there.
You don't know what happened.

1309
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,647
Oh, God.

1310
01:15:13,681 --> 01:15:15,913
Caleb hurt her,

1311
01:15:15,946 --> 01:15:18,781
and Melanie threatened to bring
us all down because of that.

1312
01:15:18,813 --> 01:15:21,147
So your solution was to make
your brother think

1313
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:23,580
he murdered a girl
and to make <i>me</i> think it?

1314
01:15:23,614 --> 01:15:25,147
What other choice did I have?

1315
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:27,913
I knew that you wouldn't
had Caleb over to the police.

1316
01:15:27,946 --> 01:15:29,913
I knew that
you would protect him.

1317
01:15:29,946 --> 01:15:31,447
I would have protected you.

1318
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,347
Well, I really couldn't
count on that.

1319
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:34,813
Matthew...

1320
01:15:34,846 --> 01:15:38,213
you don't love me
as much as you love Caleb.

1321
01:15:38,247 --> 01:15:39,747
You never have.

1322
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,047
Perhaps.

1323
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,846
But it's because
he's needed me more.

1324
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,013
You are always going to
find love in the world.

1325
01:15:50,047 --> 01:15:51,813
Don't you understand?

1326
01:15:51,846 --> 01:15:55,247
He was only ever
going to get it from me.

1327
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,647
You know,
I know you believe that.

1328
01:16:00,113 --> 01:16:02,580
That's why I've tried
so hard to forgive you.

1329
01:16:04,447 --> 01:16:05,913
And who knows?

1330
01:16:05,946 --> 01:16:09,781
Maybe one day I will.

1331
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:28,147
  9-1-1.
- What is your emergency?

1332
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:30,781
I need the police.

1333
01:16:36,946 --> 01:16:39,113
See, I told you
she had cash.

1334
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,747
Danielle, I don't know
what you're planning,

1335
01:17:03,781 --> 01:17:06,681
but I need to talk to you
right now.

1336
01:17:06,714 --> 01:17:08,614
Give it up, Mom.
We're leaving.

1337
01:17:08,647 --> 01:17:10,247
I'm calling the police.

1338
01:17:15,147 --> 01:17:17,980
Do you remember
that girl Melanie Foster?

1339
01:17:18,013 --> 01:17:21,813
Matthew is the one
who killed her.

1340
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:24,314
I know you don't want us
to be together,

1341
01:17:24,347 --> 01:17:27,614
but that's the lamest thing
I've ever heard.

1342
01:17:27,647 --> 01:17:30,347
His mother told me
what happened. It's true.

1343
01:17:34,781 --> 01:17:36,447
Let's go, Danielle.

1344
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,380
Mom, please move.

1345
01:17:47,414 --> 01:17:49,380
No.
I gave up on your brother,

1346
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:52,213
and I'm not gonna make
that mistake with you.

1347
01:17:52,247 --> 01:17:55,647
We don't have time for this.

1348
01:17:55,681 --> 01:17:59,380
Where did you get that?
What are you doing?!

1349
01:17:59,414 --> 01:18:00,880
Move away!

1350
01:18:00,913 --> 01:18:02,514
Danielle...

1351
01:18:04,213 --> 01:18:06,647
I want you to get out
of the house now.

1352
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:08,647
He's a killer.
- Shut up!

1353
01:18:08,681 --> 01:18:10,280
Don't point that
at my mother!

1354
01:18:10,314 --> 01:18:11,913
Danielle!

1355
01:18:11,946 --> 01:18:13,547
I'm serious. Go.

1356
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:15,013
What's wrong with you?!

1357
01:18:15,047 --> 01:18:16,714
I'm gonna shoot you!

1358
01:18:16,747 --> 01:18:19,480
Matthew, stop it!

1359
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:27,614
If that's what it takes...

1360
01:18:29,681 --> 01:18:31,147
to get my daughter...

1361
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:34,180
Stop it!
- To see who you really are...

1362
01:18:34,213 --> 01:18:36,846
Stop pointing that
at my mother!

1363
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,147
Then fine.

1364
01:18:39,913 --> 01:18:42,846
What are you doing?!
Do it.

1365
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,614
Stop!

1366
01:19:22,647 --> 01:19:24,347
It's okay, baby.

1367
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,913
Hey, it's just me again.
Um...

1368
01:20:31,946 --> 01:20:33,913
When you got the invitation,

1369
01:20:33,946 --> 01:20:36,414
I thought that you gave me
the thumbs up,

1370
01:20:36,447 --> 01:20:40,080
but I guess
if that was actually...

1371
01:20:40,113 --> 01:20:43,747
some other type
of finger gesture, uh...

1372
01:20:43,781 --> 01:20:47,247
well, I apologize for leaving
you all these messages

1373
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:50,681
and wasting your time.

1374
01:20:55,047 --> 01:20:58,747
 

1375
01:21:33,913 --> 01:21:37,113
<i>This is the street</i>
<i>where I used to live...</i>

1376
01:21:38,614 --> 01:21:43,913
<i>and these were the people</i>
<i>with whom I shared my life.</i>

1377
01:21:43,946 --> 01:21:46,946
<i>I met them the day</i>
<i>they moved in.</i>

1378
01:21:50,147 --> 01:21:53,547
<i>And I saw</i>
<i>what they brought with them...</i>

1379
01:21:56,681 --> 01:22:00,514
<i>beautiful dreams</i>
<i>for the future.</i>

1380
01:22:00,547 --> 01:22:05,280
<i>And quiet hopes</i>
<i>for a better life...</i>

1381
01:22:07,747 --> 01:22:12,913
<i>not just for themselves,</i>
<i>but for their children, too.</i>

1382
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:19,213
<i>If I could, would I tell them</i>
<i>what lies ahead?</i>

1383
01:22:19,247 --> 01:22:22,213
<i>Would I warn them
of the sorrow and betrayal

1384
01:22:22,247 --> 01:22:25,714
<i>that lie in store?</i>

1385
01:22:25,747 --> 01:22:29,113
<i>No. From where I stand now,</i>

1386
01:22:29,147 --> 01:22:31,614
<i>I see enough of the road</i>
<i>to understand</i>

1387
01:22:31,647 --> 01:22:35,647
<i>how it must be traveled.</i>

1388
01:22:35,681 --> 01:22:39,681
<i>The trip</i>
<i>is to keep moving forward,</i>

1389
01:22:39,714 --> 01:22:42,213
<i>to let go of the fear</i>
<i>and the regret</i>

1390
01:22:42,247 --> 01:22:43,880
<i>that slow us down</i>

1391
01:22:43,913 --> 01:22:46,347
<i>and keep us from enjoying</i>
<i>a journey</i>

1392
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:49,247
<i>that will be over too soon.</i>

1393
01:22:51,247 --> 01:22:56,614
<i>Yes, there will be</i>
<i>unexpected bends in the road,</i>

1394
01:22:56,647 --> 01:23:01,280
<i>shocking surprises</i>
<i>we didn't see coming,</i>

1395
01:23:01,314 --> 01:23:04,247
<i>but that's really the point...</i>

1396
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,747
<i>don't ya think?</i>

1397
01:23:05,781 --> 01:23:07,547
Orson.
- Oh, hey.

1398
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:10,047
I wanted to come by
and see how you were doing

1399
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,080
after your great escape,
and, uh, these are for you.

1400
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:17,681
How sweet
and... unexpected.

1401
01:23:21,414 --> 01:23:23,447
Do you wanna come in?

1402
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:25,781
I'd love to.

1403
01:23:39,047 --> 01:23:42,013
