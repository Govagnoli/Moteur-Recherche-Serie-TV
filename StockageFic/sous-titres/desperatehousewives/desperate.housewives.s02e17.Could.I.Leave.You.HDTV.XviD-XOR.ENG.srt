1
00:00:00,072 --> 00:00:01,672
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...

2
00:00:01,973 --> 00:00:03,641
But no adoption agency's
gonna touch us now.

3
00:00:03,674 --> 00:00:06,041
There are ways to get babies, Carlos.

4
00:00:06,142 --> 00:00:07,242
$20,000.

5
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,907
- Wheels were put in motion...
- I love you.

6
00:00:10,216 --> 00:00:11,849
Aw, thank you.

7
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:15,183
I love Mike.

8
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:17,982
- True emotions were revealed...
- Who the hell is Mike?

9
00:00:18,016 --> 00:00:20,149
Perception is reality,
Andrew.

10
00:00:20,183 --> 00:00:23,782
My name is Bree,
and I am an alcoholic.

11
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:28,049
And false pretenses
became a way of life.

12
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:34,583
Gabrielle Solis had always been
a demanding shopper.

13
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:38,516
Carlos, come on!
They're here!

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,882
And whatever the purchase,

15
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:44,383
she always expected
the very best.

16
00:00:46,016 --> 00:00:49,715
Whether it was exotic perfume
shipped over from Paris...

17
00:00:51,349 --> 00:00:55,782
a high fashion gown straight
from a runway in Milan...

18
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,550
or designer shoes
flown in from Manhattan.

19
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,183
But on this day,

20
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:07,082
her expectations were
going to be put to the test.

21
00:01:07,116 --> 00:01:10,782
You see, Gabrielle was now
shopping for a baby,

22
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:13,383
and there was a problem...

23
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,815
with the manufacturer.

24
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:21,849
Mostly, I just wanna feel
like I'm giving my baby

25
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:25,782
to people who have what it takes
to be really great parents.

26
00:01:25,815 --> 00:01:27,782
Well, you won't find
another couple

27
00:01:27,815 --> 00:01:30,082
with more love for a child.

28
00:01:30,116 --> 00:01:33,916
Isn't that right, honey?
Honey?

29
00:01:33,949 --> 00:01:35,982
Right, right.
Uh, lots of love.

30
00:01:37,283 --> 00:01:39,449
Honey, can I talk to you
for a second?

31
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:41,849
Yeah.

32
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,616
Okay, look, we have
to find another mother.

33
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,416
- Why?
- Okay, this isn't easy to say,
so I'm just gonna say it,

34
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:53,416
- but have you taken
a good look at her?
- Oh, my God.

35
00:01:53,449 --> 00:01:55,516
Are you trying to say that
you don't want Deanna's baby

36
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,583
- because she's plain?
- No, plain I can handle.

37
00:01:57,616 --> 00:01:59,583
Carlos, since that woman
has walked into our house,

38
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:01,416
the clocks
have stopped working.

39
00:02:01,449 --> 00:02:03,516
No one can predict what
a child is gonna look like.

40
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,116
For all you know, her kid could
end up winning beauty contests.

41
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,316
With her D.N.A., the only thing that kid's
gonna be winning is best in show.

42
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,650
Look, Carlos, I am sorry,
but I want a pretty baby,

43
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:15,082
- so let's find another mother.
- Mnh-Mnh. I'm not gonna let

44
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:17,583
your shallow obsession
with looks screw this up.

45
00:02:17,616 --> 00:02:19,882
I want a child. Any child.

46
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:24,383
Fine. Just know that in a couple
of days when that thing is born,

47
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,882
and you're gonna have
to cuddle and snuggle up

48
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,949
with something
with that face on it,

49
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,982
don't come crying to me.

50
00:02:36,516 --> 00:02:38,149
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:39,849
Now where were we?

52
00:02:39,882 --> 00:02:41,916
We were just talking about
the custody arrangement

53
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:43,416
once Deanna gives birth.

54
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:45,283
It's usually best
that the mother

55
00:02:45,316 --> 00:02:47,516
doesn't see the child
at all.

56
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,782
So as soon as the doctors finish
giving their initial checkup...

57
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:04,016
...the baby
will be handed over you.

58
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:09,082
Yes, Gabrielle had always been
a demanding shopper.

59
00:03:09,116 --> 00:03:10,949
Sorry.

60
00:03:12,283 --> 00:03:16,849
Because she knew
there are some purchases...

61
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:20,349
that can't be returned.

62
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,050
2x17:
Could I Leave You?

63
00:04:02,682 --> 00:04:05,250
At 6:10 the next morning,

64
00:04:05,282 --> 00:04:07,616
Deanna Pruse
went into premature labor

65
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:09,983
and gave birth
to what would eventually be

66
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:14,150
an incredibly attractive
baby boy.

67
00:04:15,783 --> 00:04:19,482
At 11:43, Dr. Hanson Mills
cut the umbilical cord,

68
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:23,849
Forever separating
mother and child.

69
00:04:23,883 --> 00:04:25,749
At that exact same moment,

70
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:29,415
Dr. Ron McCready entered
the private room of Susan Mayer

71
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:34,016
with every intention
of severing their connection.

72
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:36,250
Hey there. How's it goin'?

73
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:39,049
Great.
I'm about to be released.

74
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,616
Oh, that's terrific.
Who's Mike?

75
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:44,382
I...

76
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,849
Why do you ask?

77
00:04:46,883 --> 00:04:48,783
I don't know. No reason.

78
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:51,216
Ah, it's just, uh..

79
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,216
Just before the operation,

80
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,183
just before you went under,
I said, "I love you,"

81
00:04:56,216 --> 00:04:58,549
And you said,
"I love Mike."

82
00:04:58,582 --> 00:05:01,783
I did?

83
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:05,449
Oh, is that why you haven't been in
to see me since my surgery?

84
00:05:05,482 --> 00:05:07,749
Answer the question.

85
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:10,049
I don't even know
a Mike.

86
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:15,216
- Everyone knows a Mike.
- Yes, everyone does know a Mike.

87
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,716
Actually, you're right.
I did know a Mike in college.

88
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:20,382
We did this play together,
"Pippin." It wasn't very good.

89
00:05:20,415 --> 00:05:23,549
Anyways, I never thought of him,
so you shouldn't be accusing me.

90
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:25,415
I was probably
just hallucinating.

91
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:27,516
Fine, fine.

92
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:29,749
So... who's the guy
you're married to?

93
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:31,916
Damn that nurse Heisel!

94
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:35,150
Or should I say, "who's the guy
you're cheating on?"

95
00:05:35,183 --> 00:05:37,150
Okay, yes,
I did remarry my ex,

96
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:39,783
But it was only because
he has great health insurance.

97
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:42,049
Didn't Miss blabbermouth
tell you that, too?

98
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,816
- You... you committed insurance fraud?
- Only in the legal sense.

99
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:48,349
And I just didn't tell you
because I wanted to protect you.

100
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,349
- Susan...
- Okay, you know what?

101
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:53,183
You should come over to dinner
and meet Karl, and you can see

102
00:05:53,216 --> 00:05:55,482
that there is absolutely
nothing between us.

103
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:58,016
So wait,
once you're fully recovered

104
00:05:58,049 --> 00:05:59,516
you're gonna divorce him?

105
00:05:59,549 --> 00:06:01,582
Oh, yeah, that's the plan.
I swear.

106
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:04,749
And you swear that you're not
in love with anyone named Mike?

107
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:09,415
Sure.

108
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,549
Okay.

109
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,449
Come here.

110
00:06:16,482 --> 00:06:19,816
I believe you.

111
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,116
Next morning,
I woke up in an alley.

112
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,649
My wallet had been stolen.

113
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:27,216
I was lying in a pool
of my own vomit.

114
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,282
That's when I knew
I'd hit rock bottom.

115
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:36,783
Okay, who's next?

116
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:37,816
Bree.

117
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:42,649
Oh! Um, I couldn't
possibly top that.

118
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:44,183
Thank you, though.

119
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,582
Hi. Before coming
to these meetings,

120
00:06:56,616 --> 00:07:00,549
I never realized how messy
substance abusers can be.

121
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:02,549
We usually leave
the doughnut crumbs

122
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:04,549
For the overeaters anonymous
group at meets after us.

123
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:06,983
You know,
just to mess with 'em.

124
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:08,783
You're awful.

125
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:11,382
So... tell me, Bree,
how long have you been sober?

126
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:14,150
Gosh, um...

127
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,216
I'm not exactly sure.

128
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,016
Oh. Is somebody
still drinking?

129
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:21,516
Now why would you
say that?

130
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:23,516
I've never met
an alcoholic yet

131
00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:27,183
who didn't know exactly how long
it'd been since his last drink.

132
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,150
Okay, you got me.

133
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:35,150
I'm not really
an alcoholic.

134
00:07:35,183 --> 00:07:36,749
You don't say.

135
00:07:36,783 --> 00:07:39,250
It's true. I'm coming here
because of my son.

136
00:07:39,282 --> 00:07:42,282
You see, he's... he's trying
to take me to court to become

137
00:07:42,315 --> 00:07:45,783
an emancipated minor, and he's
planning on lying to the judge

138
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:48,282
and telling him that
I am some sort of dreadful lush.

139
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:50,783
So I'm coming to these meetings
to give the impression

140
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:53,783
- that I have changed.
- But you don't really need to change

141
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:56,016
because you don't have
a problem with alcohol.

142
00:07:56,049 --> 00:07:58,682
Exactly.

143
00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:00,183
I'll tell you what.

144
00:08:00,216 --> 00:08:02,582
Here's my card.

145
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:04,582
And if you ever
do have a problem

146
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:07,549
or you just feel like talking,
give me a call, okay?

147
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:09,682
I know you think
I'm kidding myself,

148
00:08:09,716 --> 00:08:11,216
but I'm not.

149
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,415
I'm nothing like
you people.

150
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:16,482
I just don't have
a compulsive personality.

151
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:19,315
Hmm.

152
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:28,449
Word is out all over town
that you're unhappy at Zimms,

153
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:32,049
so why not jump ship
and come to Parcher & Murphy?

154
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,482
I swear, Veronica,
you would fit in so well here.

155
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:36,482
I do need
to make a change, Lynette,

156
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,315
but the money
you're offering...

157
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:41,516
Yeah, it sucks,
but there are other perks:

158
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,849
- The expense account, the corner office...
- I don't know.

159
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:46,549
You're just gonna have to give
me some time to think about it.

160
00:08:46,582 --> 00:08:49,415
Fair enough, fair enough.
Okay, what is your secret?

161
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:52,083
How can you eat like that
and keep your figure?

162
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:55,083
It's the breast-feeding.
It burns so many calories.

163
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:57,983
It's like having a treadmill strapped to your chest.

164
00:08:58,016 --> 00:09:00,582
I didn't know
you had a child.

165
00:09:00,616 --> 00:09:03,415
Yes, my son Donovan.
He's the love of my life.

166
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:05,282
Really, Veronica?

167
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:07,949
Well, you know, there's another
perk that I just thought of.

168
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:15,315
Oh, my gosh,
this is fantastic!

169
00:09:15,349 --> 00:09:17,315
They don't have
day care at Zimms.

170
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,983
How can they not?

171
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,849
For working parents like
you and me, it's a necessity.

172
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:23,816
So is the pot
getting sweeter?

173
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:25,916
Would people here be cool
about my breast-feeding Donovan?

174
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:28,183
The guys at Zimms
were real jerks about that.

175
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:30,482
Parcher & Murphy
is completely mother-friendly.

176
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:31,849
No one would say a word.

177
00:09:31,883 --> 00:09:33,349
Oh!

178
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:36,983
What the heck, I'm in.

179
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:39,216
Yeah?
Well, that's fantastic!

180
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,783
Oh, my God,
whose kids are those?

181
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,049
I have absolutely no idea.

182
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,749
- Let's go hammer out the details.
- Okay.

183
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:53,349
Mm. Ooh.

184
00:09:53,382 --> 00:09:55,849
These can't be
our only choices, Mr. Beale.

185
00:09:55,883 --> 00:09:57,816
I mean, come on.

186
00:09:57,849 --> 00:09:59,849
Each girl is uglier
than the next.

187
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:02,116
Look, finding a gorgeous
pregnant woman who's willing

188
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,649
to give her baby to a couple
with a criminal record

189
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:07,349
- isn't exactly a walk in the park.
- I don't care if it's a walk in the sewer.

190
00:10:07,382 --> 00:10:09,616
We are hemorrhaging money
into your bank account,

191
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:12,482
- and I expect to see results.
- You know, Mrs. Solis,

192
00:10:12,516 --> 00:10:14,916
you can catch more flies
with honey than with vinegar.

193
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:16,916
If I wanted to catch flies,

194
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,816
all I would have to do
is call up one of these girls.

195
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:22,250
Trust me,
the flies would follow.

196
00:10:22,282 --> 00:10:24,749
Excuse me, sir, there's
a Libby Collins here for you.

197
00:10:24,783 --> 00:10:28,415
I'll be right out there.
Uh, I took the liberty

198
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:30,649
of inviting this girl
down here to meet you.

199
00:10:30,682 --> 00:10:32,916
Now I wouldn't exactly say
she's a quality human being,

200
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:34,682
but she is attractive.

201
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:38,049
If you don't respond to her,
I'm afraid I'm out of ideas.

202
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,250
He's going to dump us
as clients

203
00:10:42,282 --> 00:10:44,216
if you don't stop
being so damn picky.

204
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,216
We're gonna
have to stare at this face

205
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,816
for the next 18 years.

206
00:10:47,849 --> 00:10:50,749
I don't think now
is the time to skimp on quality.

207
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,716
Gabrielle, Carlos...

208
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:55,250
I'd like you to meet Libby.

209
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:05,749
Well, now,
this I can work with.

210
00:11:06,576 --> 00:11:08,109
So getting pregnant

211
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:10,309
was the worst thing that
could've ever happened to me,

212
00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:13,409
'cause I went into debt
and I had to stop performing.

213
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:16,076
Libby's a pole dancer
in a strip club.

214
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,576
Oh!

215
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,976
Wow, that... that sounds
like interesting work.

216
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:23,376
You'd think so,
but it gets old quickly.

217
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:25,976
My big dream
is to become a choreographer.

218
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:27,942
- Really?
- Yeah. I made up this one move.

219
00:11:27,976 --> 00:11:30,109
It's called
"the serpent's tongue,"

220
00:11:30,143 --> 00:11:32,942
And all the girls at the club
are doing it now. It's so cool.

221
00:11:32,976 --> 00:11:35,009
If I had a pole
I could show you.

222
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:37,775
Well, we'll have to go down
to the club and check that out.

223
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:41,276
- We'll make a night of it.
- Yeah, we'll do that.

224
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:43,876
So, Libby,
who's the father?

225
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:45,543
Honestly, I don't know.

226
00:11:45,576 --> 00:11:47,842
I mean, there's a lot of guys
who come into the club,

227
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:49,942
And they all buy me drinks,

228
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:53,276
And sometimes I get a little bit
more friendly than I intend to.

229
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:55,176
I hope you don't think
I'm a slut.

230
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:56,510
No!

231
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,510
No, actually,
all we think about

232
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:02,042
when we look at you
is how pretty you are.

233
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:04,042
Well, I've heard enough,
Mr. Beale.

234
00:12:04,076 --> 00:12:06,909
If Libby here likes us as much
as much as we like her,

235
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:10,042
we should just go ahead
and move to adopt her baby girl.

236
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:13,610
First, we should probably talk
about how much money I want.

237
00:12:13,642 --> 00:12:16,576
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

238
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,543
Nobody's buying a baby here.
That's illegal.

239
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:20,976
Money can never
exchange hands.

240
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:22,976
Libby, you'll make a list
of your expenses,

241
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,809
and the Solises here will pay.

242
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:27,309
Oh, but can't they also
buy me gifts?

243
00:12:27,343 --> 00:12:29,842
I knew this one girl who gave up
her baby, and she got a Harley.

244
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:33,909
Well, I don't know that we can
afford a Harley, but I'm sure

245
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:37,143
we'll find some way
to express our gratitude.

246
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:39,343
Okay.

247
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:40,610
Whatever.

248
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:43,209
Well, my lunch break is over,

249
00:12:43,243 --> 00:12:46,076
so I have get back
to the club.

250
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:48,976
Till I get rid of this kid,
they got me slinging drinks.

251
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:52,276
It was really nice to meet you,
Mr. and Mrs. Soulless.

252
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:54,243
Oh, it's actually
pronounced Solis.

253
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:55,343
Sorry.

254
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:56,775
So what kind of name is that?

255
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,510
Uh, it's Mexican.

256
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:00,543
Both our families
come from Guadalajara.

257
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:03,042
Huh.

258
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:04,709
I figured you were Italian.

259
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,209
Nope. Latino.
Proud of it.

260
00:13:08,742 --> 00:13:11,176
Good for you.

261
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:19,343
Wow, she's... gorgeous.

262
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:22,909
Yeah. My little girl's gonna
inherit some wonderful genes.

263
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:24,909
Is this
Libby's real hair color?

264
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:26,409
Yes, it's all natural,

265
00:13:26,443 --> 00:13:28,510
from her straight teeth
to her "c" cup.

266
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:30,842
And I know she's athletic
because she's a pole dancer,

267
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:34,842
so I really hope that my
little girl inherits that as well.

268
00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:38,076
No, the athletic gene,
not the pole dancing gene.

269
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:42,576
Suzie-baby?

270
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,309
Oh, I got your call, uh...
I thought I'd stop by.

271
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,309
I didn't realize
you had company. Hello, ladies.

272
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:50,143
Um, we'll just be a second.
Just wheel me.

273
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:51,675
Be right back.

274
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:53,942
Just be a second.

275
00:13:53,976 --> 00:13:56,109
Did he just call her "baby"?

276
00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:58,443
Yeah. When did they
stop hating each other?

277
00:13:58,826 --> 00:14:02,893
I need you to ditch Edie tomorrow night
and have dinner with Dr. Ron and me.

278
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,025
Now why would I do that?

279
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:09,426
Well, for starters, because you banged your
secretary and owe me for the rest of your life.

280
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:10,825
I'll bring the wine.

281
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:12,525
Well, you know,
before Mike came along,

282
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,726
- I always just assumed
they'd get back together.
- Why?

283
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,959
I thought they always annoyed
the heck out of each other.

284
00:14:17,993 --> 00:14:20,093
You didn't know them
during the good times.

285
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,926
I mean, there was such a spark
between them, so much passion.

286
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,926
They would always
make each other laugh.

287
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,559
You actually told Dr. Ron
that you still love Mike?

288
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:31,425
Okay, will you shut up?
It's not funny. I was drugged.

289
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:32,926
Right. Sorry, sorry.

290
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,059
So how'd you
get out of that one?

291
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:38,159
I lied and I told him
I didn't know a Mike.

292
00:14:38,193 --> 00:14:40,993
- Everyone knows a Mike.
- I am aware of that.

293
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:43,592
- So why didn't you just...
- 'Cause I panicked, okay?

294
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:46,226
Dr. Ron hadn't come in
to see me since the operation

295
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,226
and I was feeling
insecure and...

296
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,226
I just didn't
feel like the truth

297
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,326
was a luxury I could afford.

298
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,692
Yes, go ahead.
You may resume laughing.

299
00:14:59,726 --> 00:15:01,159
Uh...

300
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:03,993
Ladies, always a pleasure.
And you, I'll see you tomorrow.

301
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:11,626
What?

302
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:13,626
This is just
a preliminary sketch,

303
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:15,626
but you see what
I'm thinking of?

304
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:18,425
I love it. I just love it.
Let's get a copy to Ed.

305
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:23,626
Oh, shoot, I gotta take this one. I'm sorry, it's Tom.
- That's okay. My nanny is here with my son.

306
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:26,626
- I need to go feed him anyway.
- Perfect! Take your time.

307
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,759
Hey, honey.
How's the big apple treating ya?

308
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:32,659
Good. Did those, uh,
snooty clients like your pitch?

309
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:34,993
Well, that's perfect.

310
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:37,592
Excellent.

311
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:39,559
Uh-Huh.

312
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:44,926
Um, I'm...

313
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,492
I'm, um... I'm gonna have...
I'm gonna call you back.

314
00:16:16,026 --> 00:16:18,459
Oh, my God!

315
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,693
Hello there!

316
00:16:22,726 --> 00:16:25,626
I thought you and your friend
might like some snacks.

317
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:28,693
He's my lawyer, and this is
privileged communication,

318
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:31,593
- So get out.
- Andrew, there's no need to be rude.

319
00:16:31,626 --> 00:16:34,092
This is very kind of you,
Mrs. Van De Kamp.

320
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,526
Well, I'm still appalled
that you're helping my son

321
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,826
with this ridiculous
emancipation scheme,

322
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:41,726
but you are a guest in my house,
and guests get sandwiches.

323
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:45,092
You know, if you'd let me go
to his office, you wouldn't have

324
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:49,359
- to pretend to be nice to him.
- Andrew, there may be a judge out there

325
00:16:49,392 --> 00:16:51,292
stupid enough
to emancipate you,

326
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:53,492
but until you find him
I retain all my parental rights,

327
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:57,259
one of which is to ground your
sorry behind until kingdom come.

328
00:16:57,292 --> 00:17:00,726
Mr. Bormanis,
nice to see you again.

329
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,759
And, um, please don't
get crumbs on my carpet.

330
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,426
You have got
to get me out of here.

331
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,359
That bitch
is driving me crazy.

332
00:17:09,393 --> 00:17:11,359
This case
is not a slam dunk.

333
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:13,760
Her drinking was supposed
to be our silver bullet,

334
00:17:13,793 --> 00:17:16,192
- but since she joined A.A....
- We've gotta do something,

335
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:19,059
- because if she wins she's gonna own me.
- My advice?

336
00:17:19,092 --> 00:17:22,059
Convince her it's in her
best interest to let you go.

337
00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:25,259
- You don't wanna see
the inside of a courtroom.
- Why?

338
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:28,593
In family court,
appearance means everything.

339
00:17:28,626 --> 00:17:32,192
If she came off abusive
or stoned or even uncaring,

340
00:17:32,226 --> 00:17:34,159
we'd be in good shape.

341
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:36,760
But if there's one thing
your mom understands...

342
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:39,359
It's presentation.

343
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:49,093
Can I borrow $50?

344
00:17:49,126 --> 00:17:50,459
Purse.

345
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:57,726
Why do you want
so much money?

346
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,959
I'm 19. Sometimes I need money.
Do I have to be interrogated?

347
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:02,926
You do if you want
a dime out of me.

348
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,926
What's it for?

349
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,959
Danielle's having her birthday
next week.

350
00:18:06,993 --> 00:18:09,893
I just wanna be sure
I can get her a decent present.

351
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:12,792
Write her a poem.
It's free.

352
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:19,260
Is there
something else you want?

353
00:18:19,293 --> 00:18:21,993
Do you think
I like to beg for money?

354
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:24,492
I do this because
you won't let me get a job.

355
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:26,726
Looking after your brother
is a full-time job.

356
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:29,293
- For both of us, and you know that.
- Well, screw him!

357
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:31,626
- Matthew!
- No, I'm serious, mom,
because we have both

358
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:34,492
put our entire lives on hold,
and for what?

359
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:37,360
- It's been almost a year
and he hasn't gotten any better.
- I see him improving!

360
00:18:37,392 --> 00:18:40,425
That's because you see
what you wanna see!

361
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:42,492
It is time
to put him away, mom.

362
00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:45,326
Just let some professionals
take care of him.

363
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,459
We wouldn't have to move.
We could have our lives back.

364
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:51,792
What's wrong?

365
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:57,026
- You fightin'?
- No, sweetie.

366
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:00,260
Matthew's friend Danielle
has a birthday coming up.

367
00:19:00,293 --> 00:19:03,392
We were just talking about
what gift to give her.

368
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:05,592
Well,
I was thinking jewelry.

369
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:07,626
So 50 bucks should do it.

370
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:13,926
Why not $20?
You don't wanna spoil her.

371
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:23,963
Page 6 is an example of
the new print ad. Check it out.

372
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,496
I'm thirsty.

373
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:28,262
Oh, shh, honey,
everyone's working.

374
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:30,363
I'm sorry.
This will just take a sec.

375
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:38,129
Is it just me,
or is that bizarre?

376
00:19:38,162 --> 00:19:40,995
It's bizarre.
Totally bizarre.

377
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:47,862
- We gotta make her stop this.
- Hey, hey. Don't get me wrong.

378
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,062
I find that as bizarre
as you guys do.

379
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:53,563
But right now this firm needs
Veronica more than she needs us.

380
00:19:53,596 --> 00:19:56,363
Telling a mother how to raise
her kids is an act of war.

381
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:59,595
- We will lose her.
- The kid is 5. It's disgusting!

382
00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:04,330
Yeah, well, we'll just ask her to keep
the blinds always drawn when she nurses.

383
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:07,731
We'll still know what's going on
in there. It's a distraction.

384
00:20:08,162 --> 00:20:10,030
And God forbid
a client sees her.

385
00:20:10,062 --> 00:20:12,963
Okay, so who's gonna tell her?

386
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:21,229
You're a woman.
It's easier for you

387
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,663
to talk to her about
milk and boobs and stuff.

388
00:20:23,696 --> 00:20:26,296
No! No, uh, please,
don't make me do it.

389
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:28,162
Why don't you have
Jerry tell her?

390
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:30,663
I made a pass at her yesterday.
It'd be weird.

391
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,863
You could do it
without offending her.

392
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:35,863
Come on, Lynette.
Take one for the team.

393
00:20:40,262 --> 00:20:44,829
Okay. But for the record,
the team is made up of wimps.

394
00:20:44,863 --> 00:20:47,696
Well, the team's aware of that
and accepts your loathing.

395
00:20:51,062 --> 00:20:54,696
Yeah? Hi. No. No, no.

396
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:59,095
We were just out buying some
stuff for the baby. What's up?

397
00:20:59,129 --> 00:21:00,930
Seriously?

398
00:21:00,963 --> 00:21:03,296
Okay.

399
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,996
Thanks for calling.

400
00:21:06,896 --> 00:21:09,262
What is it?

401
00:21:09,296 --> 00:21:12,262
That was our lawyer.
Libby rejected us as parents.

402
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:14,529
- Why?
- Because we're Mexican.

403
00:21:14,563 --> 00:21:16,963
What?! Why, I...
that's discrimination.

404
00:21:16,996 --> 00:21:19,162
- It's illegal. We could have her arrested.
- It's her baby.

405
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:22,130
She can do whatever the hell
she wants to with it.

406
00:21:22,163 --> 00:21:23,362
Damn it.

407
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:25,763
No! No, you don't just
toss people aside

408
00:21:25,796 --> 00:21:28,196
- because of the color of their skin.
- We tossed those birth mothers aside

409
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,896
- because of their appearance.
- Well, that's different.

410
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:33,363
- Why?
- Because I've read the constitution,

411
00:21:33,396 --> 00:21:35,596
and it does not
protect ugly people.

412
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,662
Let's not fight about it.
It's over.

413
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:40,229
- Let's just move on to the next one.
- No. No, no, no.

414
00:21:40,263 --> 00:21:43,463
I want that woman's baby,
and I'm gonna get it.

415
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,196
And just how are you
gonna go about doing that?

416
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:50,829
Well, first of all, I'm gonna
show her one of our tax returns.

417
00:21:50,862 --> 00:21:52,862
Once she sees
how much money we have,

418
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,829
I have a hunch we're gonna
look a whole lot whiter.

419
00:21:57,563 --> 00:22:00,363
Hey, Veronica.
Hi, Donovan!

420
00:22:00,396 --> 00:22:04,229
My, he's getting big.
How old is he?

421
00:22:04,263 --> 00:22:05,630
He just turned 5.

422
00:22:05,662 --> 00:22:08,296
- Oh, wow, he's such a big boy.
- Yeah.

423
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:10,296
Hey, you know,

424
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,496
breast-feeding on this schedule
must be a real hassle.

425
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,229
I remember I used to express
my milk into a bottle.

426
00:22:15,263 --> 00:22:18,229
Made my life so much easier.

427
00:22:19,663 --> 00:22:22,462
Is there a problem,
Lynette?

428
00:22:22,496 --> 00:22:25,462
The people in this office
feel a little...

429
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:28,363
concerned...

430
00:22:28,396 --> 00:22:33,962
that you're nursing a boy
of Donovan's age.

431
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:36,163
Do they know breast milk
boosts the immune system,

432
00:22:36,196 --> 00:22:38,496
it's loaded with vitamins,
and in the third world,

433
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,695
it's not unusual to nurse babies
up to the age of 6?

434
00:22:41,729 --> 00:22:43,996
Yeah, well, in the third world,
they don't have juice boxes.

435
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,929
This is Donovan's decision.

436
00:22:45,962 --> 00:22:48,862
He will tell me when
he's ready to stop nursing.

437
00:22:48,896 --> 00:22:51,762
Come on, baby birds
don't jump out of the nest.

438
00:22:51,796 --> 00:22:54,129
They need to be pushed.

439
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:55,695
Did you also know

440
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:59,229
that breast milk is thought
to raise I.Q. scores?

441
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:09,163
Yeah, maybe if you had
weaned your kids a bit later,

442
00:23:09,196 --> 00:23:10,996
they'd be more civilized.

443
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:13,096
Ouch.

444
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:15,530
I will not be judged
by you or anyone else,

445
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,595
And if people don't like
my breast-feeding,

446
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:20,196
they can talk
to my lawyer.

447
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:26,162
And then
she took the salad bowl,

448
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:28,096
put it on the floor
and said,

449
00:23:28,129 --> 00:23:30,096
"If you wanna act like a pig,
you can eat like a pig."

450
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,646
You know, I never thought
I'd have such a good time

451
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,646
hanging out with my girlfriend
and her husband.

452
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,246
Yeah, well, believe me,
behind all the laughs,

453
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,845
- there's still plenty of
bitterness and resentment.
- Oh, really?

454
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:46,779
- Yeah.
- Hey, what do you say
you and I clear the table

455
00:23:46,812 --> 00:23:48,679
- and bring on dessert?
- No, no. I got it, I got it.

456
00:23:48,713 --> 00:23:50,679
No, honey,
you're not gonna do anything.

457
00:23:50,713 --> 00:23:52,313
You're in a wheelchair
for a reason, okay?

458
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:53,546
Why don't you let Karl and I
do the dishes?

459
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,012
All right, but if I catch you
guys in there talking about me,

460
00:23:56,046 --> 00:23:58,579
- you're gonna be the one in a wheelchair.
- Oh, really?

461
00:23:58,613 --> 00:24:00,212
- Yeah. Mmm.
- Yeah?

462
00:24:01,246 --> 00:24:03,912
Well, I think maybe the dishes
can wait for a second.

463
00:24:03,945 --> 00:24:06,079
- Just a second?
- Yeah, just a second.

464
00:24:47,745 --> 00:24:49,113
What the hell?

465
00:24:49,146 --> 00:24:51,313
What's the matter?

466
00:24:52,346 --> 00:24:54,346
Jeez, uh, we got a leak.

467
00:24:54,379 --> 00:24:56,346
Oh.
I'll sop up the water.

468
00:24:56,379 --> 00:24:59,313
Why don't you see go see
the guy across the street?

469
00:24:59,346 --> 00:25:01,313
He's a plumber,
in the gray house.

470
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:03,812
All right.
I'll be right back.

471
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:05,879
His name's Delfino.

472
00:25:09,829 --> 00:25:11,462
Where's he going?

473
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:13,429
Oh, we've got a bit
of a plumbing emergency.

474
00:25:13,462 --> 00:25:15,562
So you sent him
over to Mike's?

475
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:17,729
Oh, my God.
I am such an idiot!

476
00:25:17,763 --> 00:25:19,996
- I wasn't even thinking. Oh, God!
- Karl!

477
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:22,662
There's just
so much water here.

478
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:25,063
What were you thinking?

479
00:25:28,262 --> 00:25:31,329
Hi, Mr. Delfino? My name's Ron.
My girlfriend is Susan Mayer.

480
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:33,329
You know,
from across the street?

481
00:25:33,362 --> 00:25:35,130
Yeah, yeah...

482
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:36,629
I know her.

483
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:39,395
We've got
kind of a burst pipe.

484
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:40,529
Okay, um...

485
00:25:40,562 --> 00:25:42,596
Come on in
while I get my tools.

486
00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:45,362
And you can call me Mike.

487
00:25:48,362 --> 00:25:50,130
Oh! Ugh!

488
00:25:50,163 --> 00:25:51,996
Oh, ah, okay.

489
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:53,496
I made it.

490
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:56,529
So... Mike, have you, uh,
have you known Susan long?

491
00:25:56,562 --> 00:25:58,696
A year and a half.

492
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:00,763
Ah! Ooh!

493
00:26:00,796 --> 00:26:02,362
Didn't she mention
we dated?

494
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,796
No, no, she didn't.
She... she didn't.

495
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:09,896
Oh!

496
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,429
Can you excuse me, please?

497
00:26:14,462 --> 00:26:16,329
That smarts. Uhh!

498
00:26:20,196 --> 00:26:21,829
Liar!

499
00:26:21,863 --> 00:26:24,662
- I take it you met Mike.
- Yeah, I did.

500
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:26,329
Please,
please let me explain.

501
00:26:26,362 --> 00:26:29,496
- No, just let go of me.
- Ohh!

502
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:31,395
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

503
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:33,462
Here, come on,
let me help you.

504
00:26:33,496 --> 00:26:37,329
- Hey, get away from her!
Are you okay?
- I'm fine!

505
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,562
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- Hey, that was an accident!

506
00:26:39,596 --> 00:26:42,029
That didn't look
like an accident.

507
00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:44,462
Okay, Mike, just... it's okay.
Just go home.

508
00:26:44,496 --> 00:26:46,696
Yeah, go home, Mike.

509
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:50,163
You touch her like that again,
you're gonna be dealing with me.

510
00:26:50,196 --> 00:26:52,063
You might wanna
get out of my face.

511
00:26:52,096 --> 00:26:53,729
Or what?

512
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:55,429
Okay.

513
00:27:01,063 --> 00:27:03,863
Ron, what are you doing?

514
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:05,796
Oh, my God!

515
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:08,596
- Guys, stop it. Stop it, right now!
- All right, all right.

516
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:11,629
I can't believe
I wasted my time with you.

517
00:27:11,662 --> 00:27:13,996
You've just been
leading me on!

518
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:16,796
You're obviously
still in love with this guy.

519
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:18,863
- All right, I'm done.
- No, Ron, don't go!

520
00:27:18,896 --> 00:27:20,696
Don't call me.

521
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:22,996
Oh, Ron!

522
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:30,729
What the hell
is wrong with you?

523
00:27:30,763 --> 00:27:32,729
I thought
he was hurting you.

524
00:27:32,763 --> 00:27:35,763
Well, he wasn't!

525
00:27:35,796 --> 00:27:37,929
And now
my boyfriend is gone.

526
00:27:39,896 --> 00:27:42,596
Thank you very much.

527
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,596
Okay, put the pole
as your friend, okay?

528
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:57,996
- Push your boobs up against it.
- Oh, I can't. They're new.

529
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:00,296
Well, do something,
Cecile.

530
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:02,662
I'm losing my wood
down here.

531
00:28:02,695 --> 00:28:04,996
Wow!
That's a kickin' outfit.

532
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:07,896
Well, thank you, sweetie.

533
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:11,096
I clean up well
for a wetback, don't I?

534
00:28:14,229 --> 00:28:16,229
Look, I'm not
some sort of racist.

535
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:19,296
I just want what's best
for my baby girl.

536
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:21,930
I mean, why should I settle
for middle-class Mexicans

537
00:28:21,963 --> 00:28:25,129
when I know I can find
rich white folks to adopt her?

538
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,362
Please. Do I look
middle-class to you?

539
00:28:27,396 --> 00:28:30,496
Well, you didn't seem all that
rich in Mr. Beale's office.

540
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:31,996
I mean, when I brought up
the idea of gifts,

541
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,095
your husband, he acted like
he couldn't even afford a Harley.

542
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:37,429
So is that what it's gonna take
to change your mind... a gift?

543
00:28:37,462 --> 00:28:39,030
Fine. What do you want?

544
00:28:41,062 --> 00:28:43,629
I don't know.

545
00:28:47,062 --> 00:28:49,262
You like jewelry?

546
00:28:49,296 --> 00:28:50,462
Well, here.

547
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:52,329
Are these real diamonds?

548
00:28:52,362 --> 00:28:55,296
Honey, the one in the center
is 3 karats.

549
00:28:55,329 --> 00:28:57,663
I never touched
a real diamond before.

550
00:28:57,696 --> 00:29:00,095
Well, my husband and I
can expose you

551
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:02,996
- to a lot of nice new things.
- Well, only if I let you have my baby.

552
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,596
Well, like they say,

553
00:29:04,629 --> 00:29:07,829
there's no such thing
as a free lunch.

554
00:29:11,162 --> 00:29:12,462
Okay.

555
00:29:12,496 --> 00:29:14,129
Really?

556
00:29:14,162 --> 00:29:15,629
Just like that?

557
00:29:15,663 --> 00:29:17,796
Just like that.

558
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:21,596
Of course, you probably shouldn't tell
the lawyer about our understanding,

559
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:23,695
because then we'll have to deal
with percentages and all that.

560
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:25,396
I always hated math.

561
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,829
What's wrong?

562
00:29:34,863 --> 00:29:38,329
You never gave a crap
that we were Mexican, did you?

563
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:40,395
Not really.

564
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:42,429
So why put me through this?

565
00:29:42,462 --> 00:29:43,929
Because I thought,

566
00:29:43,963 --> 00:29:46,429
If it looked like
you weren't gonna get my baby,

567
00:29:46,462 --> 00:29:49,063
that you might be
just a bit more generous.

568
00:29:49,096 --> 00:29:52,262
Wow. You're a lot smarter
than I thought.

569
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:54,863
I'm smarter
than everybody thinks.

570
00:30:00,496 --> 00:30:03,329
Where's my mom?
I'm thirsty.

571
00:30:03,363 --> 00:30:05,363
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

572
00:30:05,396 --> 00:30:09,496
Your mom... is in her office
on a conference call,

573
00:30:09,529 --> 00:30:12,796
and she's busy, so you're just
gonna have to wait, okay?

574
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,229
What's that?

575
00:30:14,262 --> 00:30:16,862
That's chocolate milk.
I shouldn't be having it.

576
00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:22,196
Have you ever had any?

577
00:30:22,229 --> 00:30:23,995
Mnh-Mnh.

578
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:26,463
Follow me.

579
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,262
Here. Go ahead, try it.

580
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:32,962
Come on, you'll really like it.
I promise.

581
00:30:32,995 --> 00:30:34,496
Come on, yeah.

582
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:36,995
All the grown-ups
are drinking it.

583
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:38,596
Yeah, that's good.

584
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:41,229
Just... chug it on down.

585
00:30:41,262 --> 00:30:42,363
Good.

586
00:30:42,396 --> 00:30:44,496
You like that?

587
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:49,546
Would you like dessert
or another glass of wine?

588
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:52,746
Oh, no, thank you.
I have to run. Just the check.

589
00:30:54,512 --> 00:30:56,479
I have a charity event
this weekend,

590
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:00,179
and I have to find a cocktail dress
before the store closes.

591
00:31:00,212 --> 00:31:02,713
But everything
was just yummy.

592
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:06,479
Looks good on your ass.

593
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:17,746
Uh, hey, Mrs. Van De Kamp.

594
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:20,579
What do you think you're doing?
You're supposed to be grounded.

595
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:22,813
I'm, uh, buying a belt.

596
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:25,312
With what?
You don't have any money.

597
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:29,946
- You took that out of my purse.
- Give that back.

598
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,446
We are going home. Wait till
I tell the judge about

599
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:34,646
you stealing my credit cards
and sneaking off.

600
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:36,779
It's gonna do wonders for
your little emancipation case.

601
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:38,879
I don't think you're gonna
let this get to the court.

602
00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:40,646
Oh, and why is that?

603
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:43,479
Because then I'd be forced
to testify about my childhood.

604
00:31:43,512 --> 00:31:46,346
So? You had one of the loveliest
childhoods I've ever known.

605
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:47,879
You sure about that?

606
00:31:47,913 --> 00:31:50,946
'Cause I'm starting
to remember some abuse.

607
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,279
Andrew, the judge is not seriously
gonna believe that I beat you.

608
00:31:55,312 --> 00:31:57,946
Oh, I'm not talking
about that kind of abuse.

609
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,145
You know, it's funny...

610
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:04,145
the angrier I get, the more of these
repressed memories start to come up.

611
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:09,312
You can't be serious.

612
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:13,713
Like, touching me in places
you shouldn't have...

613
00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:19,046
No one is ever gonna
believe a word of that.

614
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,879
Yeah, well,
you know how people are.

615
00:32:21,913 --> 00:32:24,279
They might say
that they believe you,

616
00:32:24,312 --> 00:32:27,312
but...
they'll always wonder.

617
00:32:29,212 --> 00:32:31,846
So if I were you...

618
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:34,713
I'd back the hell off.

619
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,212
Come on, Justin.

620
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,412
I'm gonna buy you
something pretty.

621
00:32:42,746 --> 00:32:43,913
Justin!

622
00:32:49,546 --> 00:32:51,013
On second thought,

623
00:32:51,046 --> 00:32:53,379
I will have
another glass of wine.

624
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:03,346
You can leave the bottle.

625
00:34:54,076 --> 00:34:55,543
Yeah?

626
00:34:55,576 --> 00:34:59,476
Hi, it's Bree Van De Kamp.
I didn't know who else to call,

627
00:34:59,509 --> 00:35:09,142
and, well, I'm in a bit
of a situation.

628
00:35:09,176 --> 00:35:10,343
Well...

629
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:12,875
How did you
get stuck like that?

630
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:15,409
I would rather
not discuss it right now.

631
00:35:15,443 --> 00:35:18,976
Man, the other security guys
are not gonna believe this.

632
00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:20,776
- Do you mind?
- I'd prefer if you...

633
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:24,109
...didn't.

634
00:35:24,142 --> 00:35:27,875
Your son threatened you
with "repressed memories"?

635
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:31,942
Oh, my God,
he is seriously twisted.

636
00:35:31,976 --> 00:35:33,742
I gotta meet this kid.

637
00:35:33,775 --> 00:35:35,775
You sound like
you're impressed.

638
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:37,276
I sorta am.

639
00:35:37,577 --> 00:35:40,177
Sounds like you're definitely
raising an alpha male.

640
00:35:40,443 --> 00:35:43,209
I'm raising a monster,
is what I'm raising.

641
00:35:43,243 --> 00:35:45,042
It's no wonder I drink.

642
00:35:47,243 --> 00:35:49,875
I don't know why I said that.

643
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:52,076
Maybe it's true.

644
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:57,076
No, it makes it sound like I think
I have a problem, and I don't.

645
00:35:57,109 --> 00:36:01,142
Look, I don't wanna get
into a fight or anything,

646
00:36:01,176 --> 00:36:04,276
But you passed out
in a department store,

647
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:06,976
and in my way of thinking,

648
00:36:07,009 --> 00:36:08,809
that is a problem.

649
00:36:08,842 --> 00:36:12,376
Tonight was
a very unusual situation.

650
00:36:27,142 --> 00:36:30,976
I wish you could've
known me when...

651
00:36:31,009 --> 00:36:33,443
Rex was alive
and my kids were young,

652
00:36:33,476 --> 00:36:35,909
and everything was...

653
00:36:35,942 --> 00:36:37,942
the way
it was supposed to be.

654
00:36:41,275 --> 00:36:45,843
I think you really
would've liked me... so much.

655
00:36:45,876 --> 00:36:49,342
I like you just fine.

656
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:51,509
Really?

657
00:36:56,476 --> 00:36:58,843
Because I don't.

658
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:18,626
Mom?

659
00:37:20,459 --> 00:37:21,626
Andrew?

660
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,992
Caleb?

661
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:51,259
Hey, Danielle.

662
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:53,893
What are you doing here?

663
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,526
Happy birthday.

664
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:01,526
You really
have to go home.

665
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:04,125
If my mom knew you were here,
she'd freak.

666
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:07,192
- Don't you want to wear it?
- No, I don't. Now please leave.

667
00:38:07,226 --> 00:38:10,025
- I can help you with it.
- No! Didn't you hear me,
you freak?! Leave!

668
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:40,263
What's wrong?

669
00:38:40,296 --> 00:38:44,162
You can tell everyone
in the office to relax.

670
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,229
He won't
take my milk anymore.

671
00:38:46,263 --> 00:38:48,263
Already?

672
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:50,563
I mean, I'm sorry.

673
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:51,895
Yeah, I bet.

674
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,895
I mean, I'm not naive.

675
00:38:53,929 --> 00:38:56,396
I just didn't think
it would be so soon.

676
00:38:56,429 --> 00:38:59,162
Oh, sweetie...

677
00:38:59,196 --> 00:39:04,363
I know that we wanna keep them
young as long as we can,

678
00:39:04,396 --> 00:39:06,096
but kids grow up.

679
00:39:06,129 --> 00:39:07,630
They just do.

680
00:39:07,663 --> 00:39:10,162
I know.
If that's not bad enough,

681
00:39:10,196 --> 00:39:12,862
now I'm gonna get fat again.

682
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:13,962
Huh?

683
00:39:13,996 --> 00:39:16,962
Breast-feeding was the only
thing that kept the weight off.

684
00:39:16,996 --> 00:39:20,363
Every mealtime was like
doing 30 minutes of cardio.

685
00:39:20,396 --> 00:39:22,663
Now I'm gonna have
to join a gym!

686
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:27,996
Wow, that is...

687
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:29,663
really a bummer.

688
00:39:29,696 --> 00:39:31,062
It is.

689
00:39:31,096 --> 00:39:33,962
It really is.

690
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:58,496
Hey, uh,
Julie let me in.

691
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,962
I can see that.

692
00:40:00,996 --> 00:40:03,563
So, what, did you run out
of strangers to beat up

693
00:40:03,596 --> 00:40:06,363
on the street, and you're going
house to house now?

694
00:40:06,396 --> 00:40:08,229
I feel really awful
about what happened.

695
00:40:08,263 --> 00:40:10,563
If you don't wanna be
my boyfriend, fine.

696
00:40:10,596 --> 00:40:13,596
Don't beat up the only guy who
wants to volunteer for the job.

697
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,196
Look,
I know I overreacted.

698
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:17,596
But come on,
the way he was yelling at you?

699
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,596
I deserved it, believe me.
After what I did...

700
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,529
God,
this is such a mess.

701
00:40:22,563 --> 00:40:24,862
He won't even
return my phone calls.

702
00:40:24,895 --> 00:40:27,429
What'd you do?

703
00:40:27,463 --> 00:40:30,263
I said something to Dr. Ron
before the operation,

704
00:40:30,296 --> 00:40:32,996
and it just...
devastated him.

705
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:34,895
What?

706
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:36,996
I can't tell you.

707
00:40:37,029 --> 00:40:38,996
Yeah, you can.
You can tell me anything.

708
00:40:39,029 --> 00:40:40,663
You know that.

709
00:40:40,696 --> 00:40:42,529
Mom, um, phone call.

710
00:40:42,563 --> 00:40:44,029
It's Dr. Ron.

711
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:45,663
Oh?

712
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:48,129
Um...

713
00:40:48,162 --> 00:40:49,962
I need to take this.

714
00:40:52,363 --> 00:40:55,363
You, um, you wanna
talk about this later?

715
00:40:58,096 --> 00:40:59,862
No.

716
00:40:59,895 --> 00:41:01,962
No, not really. Um...

717
00:41:01,996 --> 00:41:04,696
What's the point?

718
00:41:15,129 --> 00:41:16,463
Hi.

719
00:41:18,496 --> 00:41:20,429
At that precise moment

720
00:41:20,463 --> 00:41:24,296
as Dr. Hanson Mills was cutting
yet another umbilical cord,

721
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:30,029
other ties were being severed
all over town.

722
00:41:30,062 --> 00:41:32,529
Like the one
between a child and the mother

723
00:41:32,563 --> 00:41:35,795
who didn't want him
to grow up so quickly.

724
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:39,029
Or the one
between a case of fine wine

725
00:41:39,062 --> 00:41:44,762
and the housewife who hadn't wanted
to admit that she had a problem.

726
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:47,929
Or the one between a woman
and the boyfriend

727
00:41:47,962 --> 00:41:50,630
who couldn't forgive
her betrayal.

728
00:41:52,795 --> 00:41:55,563
The choice to separate
from what we love is painful...

729
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:59,762
Hey. How's my girl today?

730
00:41:59,795 --> 00:42:01,762
How are both of my girls?

731
00:42:01,795 --> 00:42:03,762
The only thing worse...

732
00:42:03,795 --> 00:42:07,162
We're doing good.
We're doing real good.

733
00:42:08,196 --> 00:42:11,663
...is when someone we've trusted
makes the choice for us.
