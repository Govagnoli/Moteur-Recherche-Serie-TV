1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,300
Previously on "desperate housewives,"

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,000
Susan played with fire...

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,400
that's not my cup.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,700
And could get burned.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,400
Go to a spa or go shopping.
Find a way to relax.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,700
- Gabrielle...
- Get here as fast as you can.

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,800
...found herself a playmate.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,000
Lynette couldn't get her kids to stop playing.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,900
Ma'am, you know why I pulled you over?

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,600
Yeah, I have a theory.

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,600
If I don't start getting some sleep pretty soon,

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,403
I'll be forced to move back
upstairs out of sheer exhaustion.

13
00:00:26,403 --> 00:00:28,700
And Bree played hardball.

14
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,800
Everyone has a little dirty laundry.

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,600
When I was alive, I maintained
many different identities --

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,400
lover, wife, and ultimately, victim.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,200
Yes, labels are important to the living.

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,100
They dictate how people see themselves,

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,800
like my friend Lynette.

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,000
She used to see herself as a career woman,

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
and a hugely successful one at that.

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,500
She was known for her power lunches,

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
her eye-catching presentations,

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,800
and her ruthlessness in wiping out the competition.

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,100
But Lynette gave up her career to assume a new label --

26
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,200
the incredibly satisfying role of full-time mother.

27
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,600
Scavo residence.

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes, this is me.

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,600
But unfortunately for Lynette,

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,500
this new label frequently fell
short of what was advertised.

31
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,900
How in the world did they...

32
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,700
I left the door to the art supply
cupboard open for five minutes.

33
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,700
That's all.

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,000
Five minutes.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,400
The little girl --
why didn't she say anything?

36
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Your boys work quickly.

37
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Well...obviously, they will
be punished for this -- severely.

38
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,800
I hesitate bringing this up, since
you got so ugly about it last time...

39
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
they don't have attention-deficit disorder,

40
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,700
and I'm not going to drug my boys
just to make your job easier.

41
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,500
I'd rather change teachers.

42
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,800
The boys are in my class because I'm
the only teacher who can handle them.

43
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,200
What if we separate the twins?

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,900
Put them in different classes?

45
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,500
They're much calmer when they're
not bouncing off one another.

46
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,200
We can try that.

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,800
But if it doesn't work, we may
no longer be able to accommodate them.

48
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,100
It suddenly occurred to Lynette
her label was about to change yet again...

49
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,800
come on.

50
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,400
And for the next few years,
she would be known as...

51
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,200
the mother of the boys who
painted tiffany axelrod blue.

52
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,440
<font color=F62B97>Episode 4 : Who's that Woman?

53
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,200
It looked to be an interesting
afternoon on wisteria lane.

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,600
A mysterious cassette tape
had been discovered by my friend Bree.

55
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
She had stolen it from her marriage counselor,

56
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,500
a counselor I'd once spoken to
in strictest confidence.

57
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,500
So how have you been?

58
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,200
I had the nightmare again.

59
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,100
It's so weird to hear Mary Alice.

60
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,600
Still the same one.

61
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,800
Yes, but this time, I was standing in a river,

62
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:12,000
and I saw the girl under the water, and she
kept screaming "Angela" over and over again.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,600
So what do you think the significance
of the name Angela is?

64
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,000
Actually, that's my real name.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,400
Her real name?

66
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,900
That doesn't make any sense.

67
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,800
I've seen her driver's license.
It did not say Angela.

68
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Bree, what does it say on the rest of the tape?

69
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,100
Just more about her nightmares
and this girl she was afraid of.

70
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,800
So what the hell do we do now?

71
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,100
I think we should show Paul the note.

72
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,900
Are you sure? He's going to freak.

73
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,000
Well, it's now or never.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,400
I mean, I saw what he's asking for the place.
It's going to sell quickly.

75
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,600
Can I say something?

76
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,700
I'm glad Paul's moving.

77
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,400
Gabby.

78
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,400
I'm sorry. He's just always given me the creeps.

79
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,900
Haven't you guys noticed
he has this dark thing going on?

80
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,700
There's something about him that just feels...

81
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,900
malignant?

82
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,200
Yes.

83
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,400
We've all sort of felt it.

84
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,300
That being said, I do love
what he's done with that lawn.

85
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,900
Mom, the dish is clean.

86
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,200
Huh? Oh.

87
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,000
I still don't understand why you don't just
ask him out on an official date date.

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,300
Oh, I'm trying a new strategy.
I'm playing hard to get.

89
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,700
How long do you think you can keep that up?

90
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,400
Oh, maybe until noon.

91
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Then I'm going to have to run over
there and beg him to love me.

92
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Uh, mom,

93
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,300
I don't think you're going
to be able to wait that long.

94
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,200
You got to be kidding.
She washed her car yesterday.

95
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,400
oh, no, she's not.

96
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,000
Yep. She's bringing out the big guns.

97
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,300
you'd better get over there.
She's wearing cotton.

98
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,500
What am I supposed to say to Mike --

99
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,000
"I saw you half-naked,
and I thought I'd drop by"?

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,600
What's that?

101
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,400
A piece of Mike's junk mail we got by mistake.

102
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,300
I held onto it in case of an emergency.

103
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,900
God bless you.

104
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,800
Hi.

105
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,200
Hey, Susan.

106
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,100
got this by mistake.

107
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,200
Oh, thanks.

108
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,400
I hope it's not important.

109
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,600
I don't know. It's just a promotion for the rialto.
They're having a film festival.

110
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,300
Oh.

111
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,100
Well,

112
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,400
guess I've done my good deed for the day.

113
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,200
I'll just head back home.

114
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,400
Bye.

115
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,200
Hey, you like old movies?

116
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,900
I love old movies. Ha.

117
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,900
I hate Susan Mayer.

118
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,600
Every time I see those big doe eyes of hers,

119
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,500
I swear to god, I just want to
go out and shoot a deer.

120
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,800
What has she done this time?

121
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,200
She is out there throwing herself
at Mike Delfino -- again.

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,600
Susan likes Mike?

123
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,100
Where the hell have you been, martha?

124
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,200
She's been lusting after him
ever since he moved in.

125
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,600
I got your message.

126
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,000
What's going on?

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,600
The boys refuse to be separated.

128
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,900
They refuse?

129
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,300
They're 6 years old. Make them.

130
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,700
Well, school regulations are pretty strict
about me wrestling with the boys.

131
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,400
But if you want to give it a shot...

132
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,000
be my guest.

133
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,100
Fine.

134
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,800
Which one goes and which one stays?

135
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,400
You pick.

136
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,300
No!

137
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:00,800
You need to be in separate classrooms.

138
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,600
But we want to be in the same one!
Honey, come on now.

139
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
Stop it. Let go! No!

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,500
We're going to take the whole table! At's right!

141
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,800
No. Come on now. I mean it!

142
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,300
I love taking baths, especially with you.

143
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,400
It's like taking a vacation from the world.

144
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,200
I hated taking baths when I was a kid.

145
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,003
Of course, back then, the only thing I had
to play with was my rubber ducky.

146
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:35,907
Oh.

147
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,000
Who's that?

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,200
It's Mr. Solis.

149
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,400
Relax. Carlos is at work,

150
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,900
and he doesn't ring the doorbell.

151
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,100
It's the cable guy.

152
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,800
He's three hours late.

153
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,300
Use the side entrance.

154
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,900
Gabrielle knew her vacation
from the world had ended.

155
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,200
What she didn't know was

156
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,000
John had left behind a souvenir.

157
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,100
I'm telling you, dad didn't
come home last night.

158
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,000
They had a fight -- a bad one.

159
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,800
How bad?

160
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,600
Like divorce court bad.

161
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,900
Listen to her.

162
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,400
She always overcompensates
when she's worried.

163
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,200
If dad moves out and leaves us with her,

164
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,400
I'll lose my mind.

165
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,000
Ah.

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,200
Dinner is on the table.

167
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,300
Mom, where'd dad go last night?

168
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,400
He got a last-minute call to speak
at a medical conference in Philadelphia.

169
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,300
Take your seats.

170
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,900
This marriage is so over.

171
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,300
Andrew?

172
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,300
Again, sorry I was late.
The scheduler overbooked me.

173
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,400
How long are you going to be?

174
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Almost done.

175
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,700
What is that scent?

176
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,500
Is that sage and citrus?
It's amazing.

177
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,400
Try to hurry. I have stuff to do.

178
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,000
Come on.

179
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,600
Aah!

180
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,500
What's happening?

181
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,300
The cable guy fell.

182
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,600
He hit his head on the tub.
He may have a concussion.

183
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,000
It's almost 8:00.

184
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
He was late.

185
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,400
Mrs. Huber.

186
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,200
Hello, Susan. I made you a pie.

187
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,900
Oh, wow. Why?

188
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,300
Do I need a motive to do something nice?

189
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,700
I can't wait for you to try this. It's mincemeat.

190
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,400
Actually, I just had dinner.

191
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,800
That's okay. You can save it for later.

192
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,500
What's so funny?

193
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,700
I was just thinking of that expression
"I'll make mincemeat out of you."

194
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,500
Mincemeat -- used to be an entrap
made up of mostly chopped meat,

195
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,100
so it was like saying
"I'll chop you up into little bits."

196
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,100
But that was centuries ago.

197
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,600
Today, mincemeat is mostly made up
of fruit, spices, and rum.

198
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,800
There's no meat in it, and still people say
"I'll make mincemeat out of you."

199
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,100
I don't know that people really say that anymore.

200
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,700
I do.

201
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,400
So, Susan, how are you?

202
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,200
I'm fine.

203
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,400
G ood.

204
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,900
You know, I have a confession to make.

205
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,300
I've always wished I'd have been
more supportive when carl left you.

206
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,100
Oh, you don't have to apologize about carl.

207
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,500
Really, carl and I are over. I've moved on.

208
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,400
Yes, I know. You've moved on
to that nice Mike Delfino.

209
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,300
He's quite a catch, isn't he?

210
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,600
You like him, don't you?

211
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,900
Uh, sure, as a friend.

212
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,900
Oh, Susan.

213
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,600
Being coy is a strategy best employed
by virgins at their first dance.

214
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,300
For women of our age, it's just annoying.

215
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Are you sure you don't want pie?

216
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,700
No, thank you.

217
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,700
I hope it works out with you and Mike.

218
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,700
You've been so desperate to land him.

219
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,300
What do you --

220
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,000
I am not desperate.

221
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,900
Oh, good lord, Susan, you burned
your rival's house down.

222
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,100
If that isn't desperate, I don't know what is.

223
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,200
Mrs. Huber, with all
due respect, you're crazy.

224
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
What's that?

225
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,000
I think you recognize it.

226
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,600
I found it in the ruins of Edie's home.

227
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,900
Well, that's not --

228
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,800
shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

229
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,900
My point is this --

230
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,900
I wasn't there for you when carl left,
but I'm here for you now.

231
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,000
As far as I'm concerned, this is our secret,

232
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,700
and no one ever need know.

233
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,300
Oh, Susan...

234
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,600
you don't know how good it feels
to finally be able to help you.

235
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
You look so pale.

236
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,400
Now, I insist you try some of my pie.

237
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,100
Go on.

238
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,000
Did I mention it's mincemeat?

239
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,300
open the door, please.

240
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,400
Hang on.

241
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,200
What?

242
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
May I come in?

243
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,200
No.

244
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,300
Well, I want to talk to you.

245
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,200
Then talk.

246
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,100
Where were you last night?

247
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
Brian's.

248
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,100
I just spoke to brian's mother.

249
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,300
Now tell me again where you were last night,
and this time, don't lie to me.

250
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,900
Where'd you say dad was again?

251
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,400
In Philadelphia?

252
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,200
Andrew, don't change the subject.

253
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,700
I'm sorry. I-I thought
the subject was telling lies.

254
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,000
I called dad's cell phone.

255
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,500
I know he moved out.

256
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,200
Well, it's just temporary, and --

257
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,500
I thought it would upset you,
so I was protecting you.

258
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,400
Whatever.

259
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,300
You lied, so stop pretending like you have
some sort of moral authority.

260
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,300
Andrew, just because I chose not to share
my marital problems with you

261
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,100
does not give you the right to be rude.

262
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,900
How about driving my father away?

263
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,500
Do I get to be rude then?

264
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,200
Hi.

265
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,300
What's this?

266
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,400
That's a sock.

267
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,100
It's a man's sock.

268
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,400
I found it under our bed.
It's not mine.

269
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,900
Oh, for god's sakes, Carlos, it's yao lin's.

270
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,100
Our maid wears size 13 gym socks?

271
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,100
No, she dusts with them.

272
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,400
See?

273
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Socks instead of rags.

274
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,700
Susan, hello.

275
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,700
Mrs. Huber.

276
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,600
Did you and Mike come together?
I saw him over in the fresh produce aisle.

277
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,900
No, like I told you before, we're just friends.

278
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,400
Oh.

279
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,200
By the way, if I didn't make it clear yesterday,

280
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,200
I absolutely did not do
that thing you accused me of.

281
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,000
Hey, Susan.

282
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Hey, Ms. Huber.

283
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,400
Nice to see you, Mike.

284
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,900
Hey.

285
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,600
You like alfred hitchcock?

286
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,400
They're doing a retrospective down at the rialto.

287
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,200
Uh...

288
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,900
I'm not really a fan.

289
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,900
Oh, come on. How can you not like hitchcock?

290
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,600
I just, uh... don't. Ha ha.

291
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,000
Oh.

292
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,400
Okay.

293
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,800
Well, uh, nice to see you.

294
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,000
You too, Ms. Huber.

295
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,900
You're so silly.

296
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,400
Pretending not to like him on my account --
I mean, really.

297
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,900
Will you just drop it?

298
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,200
You shouldn't be rude to me, Susan.

299
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,700
Your secret is not an easy burden to bear.

300
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,700
That insurance company is putting Edie through hell,

301
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,700
but still, I've said nothing.

302
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:19,300
Well -- and the longer it takes for her to get payment,
the longer she'll be staying with me,

303
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,200
eating me out of house and home,

304
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,600
using up my hot water.

305
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:30,600
What exactly is it you want from me, Mrs. Huber?

306
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,900
Uh, are these together?

307
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,400
Ring it up.

308
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,700
If the school and the pediatrician both
think the twins could stand to be medicated,

309
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,100
then what's the problem?

310
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,300
I used to run a company with 85 people,

311
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,000
and now I can't wrangle three
small boys without doping them.

312
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,700
Talk about feeling like a failure.

313
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:19,600
Lynette, you are a great mother,
but let's face it, your kids are...

314
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,000
a challenge.

315
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,300
Thank you.

316
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
That's the nicest way you could have said that.

317
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,600
You know, the truth is, when they're not
making me want to tear my hair out,

318
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,200
they're actually really sweet.

319
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,300
I'm afraid if I change the bad stuff,
I'm going to change the good stuff.

320
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,300
Yeah, it's a tough call.

321
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,000
Like this mug.

322
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,500
I love this mug.

323
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,800
If I medicate them, are they still
going to make me a mug like this?

324
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,400
You know, it's leaking.

325
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,900
Yeah, I know.

326
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,100
We talked to Paul. We told him
we need to show him something.

327
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,200
He's on his way over.

328
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,600
Thank you.

329
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,900
So, Paul, we noticed that you're selling the house.

330
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:10,100
Yes, uh, too many painful memories.
I'm sure you understand.

331
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,500
Well, before you move, we thought
there was something you should know.

332
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:23,000
It seems there may be more to Mary
Alice's death than you were aware of.

333
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,800
Oh?

334
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,500
Remember when you asked us to pack her things?

335
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,000
Well, when we did, we found a note.

336
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And we think that you should have it.

337
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,200
You can see from the postmark Mary Alice
probably got it the day she died.

338
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,400
Paul, are you going to be okay?

339
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
No.

340
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,800
Have you always cleaned with socks?

341
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,000
Yes.

342
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,200
What is that, a japanese thing?

343
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,700
I am chinese.

344
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,100
I don't like lying.

345
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,300
Yeah, well, I don't like your ironing, so there.

346
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,000
Mrs. Solis, what are you doing here?

347
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,300
Carlos found this under the bed.

348
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,900
Oh, crap.

349
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,000
It's okay. It was a close call,
but I managed to cover.

350
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,100
I got you these. So from now on,

351
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,300
we can't let Carlos see you around the house
wearing anything resembling a gym sock.

352
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,100
You want me to mow your lawn in sandals?

353
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,700
Mm-hmm.

354
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,000
I could lose a toe.

355
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,600
Imagine what you would lose if Carlos finds out
you're trimming more than the hedges.

356
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,200
Uh, yeah.

357
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,800
Why are your friends staring at me?

358
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,000
Did you tell them about us?

359
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,500
No.

360
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,300
They're staring 'cause they think you're hot.

361
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,100
Oh.

362
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,200
Okay.

363
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,100
It's 9:30. What is your brother thinking?

364
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,200
Want my advice?

365
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,400
Call Dad. Go tell him to kick Andrew's ass.

366
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,800
I am perfectly capable of handling
this without your father.

367
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,500
Sorry.

368
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,200
Where's your cell phone?

369
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,100
Call Andrewand find out wre he is.

370
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,500
Mom, he's going to know you're behind this.

371
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,200
No, he won't. Just act normal.

372
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,700
Hey, it's me.

373
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,200
Uh, what's going on?

374
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,100
He knows.

375
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,400
Andrew, this is your mother.

376
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,500
I am rapidly reaching the end of my patience with you.

377
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,200
Where are you?

378
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Are you at a bar?

379
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,100
Andrew.

380
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,200
Andrew?

381
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,500
Mom?

382
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,100
He hung up on me.

383
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,700
What are you going to do?

384
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,300
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah! Works for me!

385
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,500
Shake it, baby!

386
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,800
Over here!

387
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,400
Heath.

388
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,600
Lan.

389
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,100
Andrew.

390
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,000
Mom, how did you even know I was here?

391
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,700
You went in my room?

392
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,000
You think that's bad?

393
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,600
Tomorrow morning, I'm cleaning it.

394
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,400
Oh, by the way, Heath, I didn't get a chance
to tell you, that was a lovely solo last week at church.

395
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,100
Thank you.

396
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,700
W-we're out of here.

397
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,500
I hope it wasn't something I said.

398
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,100
Well, Andrew...

399
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,800
shall we?

400
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,400
You just humiliated me inront of my friends.

401
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,700
I'm not going anywhere with you.

402
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,800
Fine.

403
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,200
What are you doing?

404
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,400
I'm staying for the show.
I'm dying to see what all the fuss is about.

405
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,800
Uh, excuse me, waitress, I'll have a glass
of your house chardonnay.

406
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,100
Yes, ma'am.

407
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,100
I-I'm curious, Andrew, as you fantasize about this woman,

408
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,000
do you ever stop and think how she came to be on this runway?

409
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
That's someone's little girl,

410
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,600
and that someone probably had a lot of dreams for her,

411
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,300
dreams that did not include a thong and a pole.

412
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,700
It's not going to work, okay?

413
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,800
I'm not budging.

414
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,100
God only knows what she's had to deal with in her life --

415
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:09,400
abject poverty, drugs, domestic violence,
maybe even molestation.

416
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Mom.

417
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,500
And now she treats herself the way other men treat her --
like an object, a piece of meat.

418
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,900
That does it.

419
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:22,200
Kid, get her out of here.
She's killing it for the rest of us.

420
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,500
We're not here. Leave a message.

421
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,100
It's Mrs. Huber, Susan. Are you there?

422
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,200
I can see your lights are on.

423
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,400
I hope you're not screening. That's so tacky.

424
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,800
Listen, I need to talk to you.

425
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:49,400
My water heater just burst, and it's going to cost me
$600 to get a new one, and I can't afford that.

426
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,900
I'm just beside myself.
Call me as soon as you get in.

427
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,800
Julie, Julie, honey, wake up.
We need to talk.

428
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,000
Can't this wait until morning?

429
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,200
I think I'm being blackmailed.

430
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,100
And when I realized I couldn't
put out the fire, I ran.

431
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,300
I must have dropped the measuring cup in the process.

432
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,600
Mm. Why do I even let you out of the house?

433
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,400
Obviously, I can't let her get away with this.

434
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,300
The only thing to do is go to the police
and tell them what happened.

435
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,100
You can't do that.

436
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,700
Julie, I don't think they'll throw me in jail.

437
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,700
I mean, it was an accident.

438
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,800
Dad won't care if it was an accident.

439
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,800
You know he'll just use this
as an excuse to reopen custody.

440
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,600
Mom...

441
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
I don't want to live with dad.

442
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,300
I know.

443
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,300
I need to talk to you.

444
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,500
Cool. Sure.

445
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,000
You were working tuesday, right?

446
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,800
Yeah.

447
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,800
You remember the cable guy showing up?

448
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,400
And you usually work till what time -- 5:00?

449
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,100
Yeah.

450
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,400
Damn it.

451
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,400
It means he was in the house for four hours.

452
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,900
Wait, um... you know,
now that I think about it,

453
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,900
I might not have seen him.

454
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,600
Well, either you saw him
or you didn't. Which is it?

455
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,800
I didn't.

456
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,200
John...

457
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,400
did my wife ask you to lie for her?

458
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,100
Mr. Solis, uh...

459
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,700
I really don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

460
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Thank you.

461
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,700
That's all I needed to know.

462
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,300
Okay, let's run through it one more time.

463
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,200
Mom, it's not brain surgery.

464
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,300
You'll stand guard while I crawl
through Mrs. Huber's doggie door.

465
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,300
Once inside, I'll find the measuring cup. Simple.

466
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,900
Mm, god. I hate that I'm turning
you into a little thief.

467
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,600
It's our measuring cup. We're
just taking back what's ours.

468
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,600
Hey, that's right.

469
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,800
Ethically, we have nothing to be ashamed about.

470
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,200
Oh, wear these.

471
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,900
I don't want you to leave fingerprints.

472
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,000
There she goes.

473
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,200
Okay, move.

474
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,800
Oh, so glad to be playing frisbee again.
Here you go. Coming at you.

475
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,300
All right, back up a little more.

476
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,500
There you go.

477
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,300
Whoo! All right, here we go.

478
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,600
Oh, my! Whoops! Ha.

479
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,700
You better go get that. Yeah.

480
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,100
Mike.

481
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,500
Hey, Susan. I thought that was you.

482
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:14,300
Uh, yeah. Julie and I are just out tossing the frisbee around,
and it flew off into Mrs. Huber's backyard.

483
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,400
Oh, you need some help?

484
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,300
No. No, no, no.
Uh, Julie's got it.

485
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,300
Okay. Actually, I'm glad I ran into you.

486
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,200
I just wanted to make sure that
things were okay between us.

487
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,900
The other day, you seemed kind of distant.

488
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,400
Distant? What do you mean?

489
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,400
I mean, you're not mad at me
for some reason, are you?

490
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,600
No.
No, no, not at all.

491
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,300
Good. So I'm going to take one more shot at this.

492
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:44,000
I got tickets for a billy wilder retrospective
wednesday night. I'd love to take you with me.

493
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,300
You are so sweet. I would love to go.

494
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,800
All right.

495
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,700
Edie. I thought you'd be at work.

496
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,500
I'm not feeling well.

497
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,800
I got a sunburn the other day washing my car.

498
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,400
Well, don't just run off.
Come and hang out with us.

499
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,400
Boy, you are one sick ticket.

500
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,500
What?

501
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,200
It's not bad enough that I have to watch you
throw yourself at him every day,

502
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,300
and now you want to make sure
that I see it up close and personal?

503
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,700
No, it's not like that.

504
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,100
I've got to take off, but I'll call you
about wednesday night, okay?

505
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,300
Edie, wait.

506
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:35,900
Mike and I were going to go see the movies on wednesday,
and I just thought it would be fun if you joined us.

507
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,900
You want me to come with you?

508
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,800
Yeah. Yeah, that's okay, isn't it, Mike?

509
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Well, it's, uh, a limited engagement,
and it's sold out. I've only got two tickets.

510
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,400
Edie, wait.

511
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,700
Um... you should take my ticket.

512
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,200
Really?

513
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,700
Is that okay with you, Mike?

514
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Uh... yeah, sure.

515
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,200
So, um...

516
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,900
what time do you want to pick me up?

517
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,400
Well, um...

518
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,700
Hang on.

519
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,400
Ooh.

520
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,200
You think you can have sex with anyone you want, huh?

521
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,500
Carlos couldn't help but feel proud of himself.

522
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,000
After all, he'd just defended his honor.

523
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,400
Or had he?

524
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,600
Are you gay?

525
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,400
Yes. Is that why you're doing this?

526
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,600
Uh, yeah.

527
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,500
I'm going to call everyone and be like,
"can you buy some chocolates?"

528
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,000
Ladies.

529
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,800
Hey, Paul. What's up?

530
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,400
I wanted to apologize for my outburst yesterday.

531
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,800
Don't worry about it.
We unloaded a lot on you.

532
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,400
I suppose you're wondering why I
reacted so violently to that note.

533
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,800
Itid cross our minds.

534
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
Well, the truth is

535
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,300
Mary Alice was not a well perN.
She was very troubled.

536
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,600
Troubled?

537
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,400
At first, it was harmless.

538
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,900
She would leave herself notes,

539
00:34:54,900 --> 00:35:00,000
reminders like "pick up the milk" or "Zach has a dentist appointment."

540
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,900
But over time, the notes became ugly.

541
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,800
Hateful messages started showing up.

542
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,100
Mary alice was writing them
to me, to Zach, to herself.

543
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,100
Really?

544
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,300
That's why I lost it.

545
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,300
I was reminded of what Zach
and I had been through.

546
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,400
Paul, I'm so sorry.

547
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,000
- We had no idea.
- No.

548
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,000
Well, anyway, uh, I'd appreciate it
if you kept this to yourselves.

549
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,300
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

550
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,400
For Zach's sake.

551
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Of course, of course.

552
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,300
- Yeah. Okay.
- Bye.

553
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,500
Wow.

554
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,200
Yeah.

555
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,400
I think he's lying.

556
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
So do I.

557
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,400
Bang! Bang! Bang!

558
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,500
You -- you didn't get me!

559
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,700
Bang! Bang! Bang!

560
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,600
Bang! Bang!

561
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,300
Boys, could you get in here, please?

562
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,600
He broke my plane.
Did not.

563
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,600
We'll talk about that later.
Right now, I need you to take some medicine.

564
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
Are we sick?

565
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,700
Not exactly. This is a special kind of medicine.

566
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,500
It's -- it's like a vitamin,
and you'll take it every day, okay?

567
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,100
Okay.

568
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,200
Oops.

569
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,900
Stay right there

570
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,200
Now open up.

571
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,300
Mnh-mnh.

572
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,600
- Here, you --
- no way.

573
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,600
Guy-- here.

574
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,900
- No.
- Mnh-mnh.

575
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,900
In that moment, Lynette made a decision.

576
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,900
When it came to dealing with her children,

577
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,500
medication was no longer an option.

578
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:23,500
Of course, given her continuing level of frustration,
Lynette also felt a little self-medication couldn't hurt.

579
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,000
So what's your strategy?

580
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,900
Are you just never going to speak to me again?

581
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,200
Something like that.

582
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,700
I suppose I do owe you an apology.

583
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,700
Careful. Wouldn't want you
to strain yourself.

584
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,000
I shouldn't have lied to you about your father.

585
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,900
You and your sister are old enough to
handle the truth, and I'm sorry.

586
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,600
Keep going.

587
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,400
I'm mad at you for about 7,000 other things.

588
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,700
If you tnk I'm going to apologize for taking you
out of a strip club, you're wrong.

589
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,700
I consider it one of my finestoments.

590
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,900
Oh, Andrew.

591
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,100
I know you blame me for what's
happening with your father, but...

592
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:22,600
it's not entirely my fault,
and I need you to understand that.

593
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,600
I do.

594
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,800
I just... I don't want him to leave.

595
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Neither do I.

596
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,100
Mom?

597
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,300
Yeah?

598
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,500
When can I have my door back?

599
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,200
Three months.

600
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,500
Royal oaks was the scene of a hate crime today

601
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,919
when jonathan lisco, local gay activist
and part-time female impersonator,

602
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:02,100
was brutally attacked in his home.

603
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,600
Lisco speculated the attack was in response to his efforts

604
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:11,200
to secure same-sex partner insurance coverage
from his employer cliffside cable.

605
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,500
Police are circulating this sketch of the assailant.

606
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,500
I have to say, you know, certain acts
just speak for themselves.

607
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,800
I've taken a strong stand
with my company... is there something

608
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,700
you want to ask me?

609
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,200
No.

610
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,300
You took it, didn't you?

611
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,200
Good evening, Mrs. Huber.

612
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,500
It's my own fault for not hiding the cup.

613
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,200
Obviously, if you're capable of arson,

614
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,100
I should have known you'd be capable
of breaking and entering.

615
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,300
I don't know what you're talking about, Mrs. Huber.

616
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,900
I suppose you destroyed it.

617
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:04,300
Again, I don't know what you're
talking about, but, yeah. I did.

618
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:09,100
I was going to keep your secret.
It's a shame you couldn't trust me.

619
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,400
You're a piece of work.

620
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,600
You know that?

621
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,300
Oh, Susan, let's not be unpleasant.

622
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,600
We can go back to the same
friendly relationship we've always had.

623
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,100
I will keep my lawn looking nice,

624
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,500
and I will make sure that
my music isn't played too loud,

625
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,100
and if I get some of your mail,
heck, I'll run it right over,

626
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,700
'cause that's what good neighbors do.

627
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,300
But from now on, when I run into you on the street

628
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:43,400
and I say "good morning, Mrs. Huber,"
or "how are you, Mrs.Huber?"

629
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:51,900
Just know that inside, I am quietly
but decidedly hating your guts.

630
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,500
Careful, dear.

631
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,500
Let's not say things we'll live to regret.

632
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,500
Good evening, Mrs. Huber.

633
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,700
He actually said Mary Alice was crazy?

634
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,600
Not in so many words, but everything Paul said
certainly made it seem like she was schizophrenic.

635
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,300
I think he's hiding something. I know it.

636
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,400
But wait. What about the tape?
I mean, she did say that her name was Angela.

637
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,900
Mary Alice was not crazy.

638
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,100
Well, my father was a prosecutor,

639
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,800
and he always said that the simplest
explanation was usually the right one.

640
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,900
But remember what the note said --

641
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,200
"I know what you did. It makes me sick,
and I'm going to tell."

642
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,100
That's not the kind of thing
someone writes to themselves.

643
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,400
That's a message sent by an enemy.

644
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,100
So exactly what is it you hired me to do?

645
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,900
It's very simple, really --

646
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,900
someone sent that note to my wife,

647
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,500
and I need to know who.

648
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,100
What type of person would send such a note?

649
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,100
Was it an enemy?

650
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,800
Of course.

651
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,300
But what kind?

652
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,900
An acquaintance?

653
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,900
A stranger?

654
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,000
Or how about...

655
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,100
a neighbor that lives a few feet away?

656
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:40,100
