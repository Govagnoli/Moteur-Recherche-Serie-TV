00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Previously on "desperate housewives"...

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,170
you're not taking me?Dad's gonna take you.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,350
Lynette's new job came with a price.

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,340
If this charge sticks,I get sent awayfor eight years.

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,620
And carlos paid for his mistakes.

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,210
Are you in lovewith mr. Williams?

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,040
No.

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,980
I think the machinepicked up on something

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,230
that I wasn't aware of.

10
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,890
While bree detected feelings

11
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,690
she'd never known.

12
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,740
You come within 10 feet of her,I will have you arrested.

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,970
Now get out. Susan discovered something...

14
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,880
zach is your son,isn't he?

15
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,450
Too close to home.

16
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,520
The residents of the fairview county jail

17
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,910
looked forward to every tuesday.

18
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,100
That was the day that gabrielle solis

19
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,170
came to visit her husband.

20
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,510
The inmates went out of their way to give her compliments

21
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,270
whether she wanted them to or not.

22
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,410
With each visit,these accolades became

23
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,960
increasingly inventive.

24
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,310
Still,gabrielle was not flattered.

25
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,950
In fact,gabrielle started to dread this special attention.

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,220
Until one day,when...

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,150
I don't think a conjugal visitis such a ridiculous request.

28
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,630
With all due respect,mrs. Solis,

29
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,950
let's just get throughthe discovery phase first,okay?

30
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,310
But I don't thinkI can wait that long.

31
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,770
I am trying to get your husbandout of jail.

32
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,260
Do you want me to juststop everything

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,750
so you can havea booty call?

34
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,960
Excuse me,we are husband and wife.

35
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,510
We make love.It is a very sacred covenant.

36
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,280
Okay,look,all we need is 20 minutes.

37
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,430
I said no.You can't tell me no.

38
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,770
You work for me.

39
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,240
You will make it happen.

40
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,110
You can't force meto do anything.

41
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,200
I am not your maidor your gardener.

42
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,560
Whoa!Oh!

43
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,760
I can have youarrested for that.

44
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,010
Oh,really?And how about for this?

45
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,520
Ow!

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,810
You crazy bitch!

47
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,840
Ow!

48
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,000
Hey,apologize to the lady.

49
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,390
Big mistake,pal.I play golf with the warden.

50
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,300
You're gonna rot--

51
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,050
You heard him.Apologize.

52
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,770
Look,fellas,

53
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,530
I am just trying to do my job.This is all her fault!

54
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,220
If she weren't so damn horny--ow!

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,360
All right! All right!

56
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,930
come on!

57
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,710
It was at that moment it occurred to gabrielle...

58
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,870
apologize!

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,020
This was the nicest compliment she had ever received.

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,880
There was one thing all the fathers on wisteria lane had in common--

64
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,520
they could return home from a hard day's work to the family they'd left behind

65
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,510
and not feel at all guilty about the precious moments they had missed.

66
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,930
Sadly,the same could not be said for the working mothers.

67
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,640
Hey,honey,I held dinner for as long as I could.

68
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,540
It just got...

69
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,140
too late for them.

70
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,220
You couldn't have given 'em coffee or something?

71
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,960
I just feel like I'm missing out on their lives entirely.

72
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,420
Hey,you sit,eat,and I will fill you in.

73
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,910
Oh,don't eat that. That's been sitting out for hours.

74
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,500
That's for mrs. Mulberry.

75
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,430
This...

76
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,090
is for you.

77
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,710
I'm sorry. Who?

78
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,830
Oh,mrs. Mulberry.

79
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,710
Parker has an imaginary friend.

80
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,610
Um,british nanny.

81
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,490
I think he really locked into the whole "mary poppins" thing.

82
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,260
Is that why he's sleeping with an umbrella?

83
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,740
He carries it with him everywhere.

84
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,340
It's a security blanket.

85
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,260
When did this start?

86
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,730
About a week ago,I guess.

87
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,410
And you don't find it odd that parker's new nanny

88
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,040
made her appearance right at the time I went back to work?

89
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,460
Kids have imaginary friends.

90
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,330
It's no big deal.

91
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,640
I'll agree with you to a point,

92
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,970
when they're flying kangaroos or giant robots,

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,950
not surrogate mommies.

94
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,200
Hey...

95
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,650
parker is having a little trouble adjusting.

96
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,960
That's all.

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,740
Apparently,so are you.

98
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,370
Honey,don't be so sensitive.

99
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,190
I hope you're right.

100
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,840
At the risk of sounding too sensitive,

101
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,560
how come she gets a bigger portion?

102
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,390
That's it?

103
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,080
You're the one who said you wanted things to be casual between us.

104
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,620
Yeah,

105
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,430
but that doesn't mean we have to act like brother and sister.

106
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,230
I mean,you bought me ribs.I have gratitude to express.

107
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,670
What's wrong?

108
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,740
I can't do this.

109
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,190
This casual thing--

110
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,560
it's--it's weird.

111
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,000
No! No! It's not.

112
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,660
We're just gonna pretend like it was when we first started dating.

113
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,550
We just see each other occasionally,

114
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,600
you know,until we get the zach thing resolved.

115
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,480
Yeah,well,we'll just be easy about it. No commitments.

116
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,460
Except,of course,

117
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,330
neither of us is allowed to date anybody else.

118
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,360
Look,I...

119
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,570
I know how you feel about zach.

120
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,890
And,look,

121
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,380
I don't blame you.

122
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,910
But he's part of the package right now,

123
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,080
and either you can accept that or you can'T.

124
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,730
Well,anyway...

125
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,540
mike,wait!

126
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,080
I accept.

127
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,530
Are you sure?

128
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,180
Zach's your son.

129
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,270
And I have julie,

130
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,080
and you've totally accepted her.

131
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,350
I mean,granted,she's been the model child so far.

132
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,540
But she's almost 15. She's going to turn on me any minute.

133
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,710
And you better be there to help me when it gets ugly.

134
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,590
I will.

135
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,030
Good night.

136
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,720
- Uh,susan?
- Yeah?

137
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,980
Technically,we don't have to be casual anymore.

138
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,900
I can be naked in 20 seconds.

139
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,790
That includes travel time.

140
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,300
Carlos,will you calm down?

141
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,260
You incited a prison riot.

142
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,250
It wasn't a riot.

143
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,960
It was more of a melee.

144
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,200
Who's going to defend me now?

145
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,200
Doyle knew my case.

146
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,270
He knew the judge.He called me a bitch.

147
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,070
Well,were you actinglike one?

148
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,440
He refused to help meget a conjugal visit.

149
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,790
Hold it.

150
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,610
My lawyer's in tractionbecause you wanted sex?

151
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,600
Not just for me,for us.

152
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,330
In case you haven't noticed,carlos,

153
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,900
our marriage is stillon shaky ground.

154
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,710
And you thought a conjugal visit would fix it?It couldn't hurt.

155
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,520
Ever since you've been in here,all we do is bicker.

156
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,320
That's all we ever did whenI was out. That's what we do!

157
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,900
Yeah,but whenwe would finish arguing,

158
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,140
we would have this great sex.Now all we do is fight,

159
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,680
and there's no payoff,and it sucks!

160
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,440
You and I needto get laid!

161
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,850
Oh,don't judge me.

162
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,240
You're not in here becauseyou got caught helping the poor.

163
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,960
See,we'd be enjoyingthis argument more

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,450
if we had somethingto look forward to.

165
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,560
Fine. Get the damn lawyer.

166
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,360
And make it quick.

167
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,430
I take it that wasmy good night kiss.

168
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,360
George,you're a very special friend.

169
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,650
You are,but rexhasn't been dead four weeks,

170
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,250
so I think kissingon the lips is--

171
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,600
further thanyou want to go.

172
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,750
Exactly.I hope you don't mind.

173
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,930
Andrew,what are you doing?

174
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,200
Taking out the garbage.

175
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,610
Of course.You remember mr. Williams.

176
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,140
Hi,andrew.

177
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,960
George.

178
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,680
Uh,well,it's getting late,so...

179
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,110
yeah. So let me know if you wantto go out to dinner again soon.

180
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,320
There's a couple new restaurantsI'd like to try.

181
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,230
You know,we've been eating outa lot lately.

182
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,220
Why don't you come over fridayfor a home-cooked meal?

183
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,400
Wouldn't that be nice?Oh,I would love that.

184
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,070
So you leavingor what?

185
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,680
We're not donetalking.

186
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,070
She saidit was getting late.

187
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,990
In case you missed that,that was a hint.

188
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,380
Andrew...

189
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,350
that wasn't a hint.

190
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,690
I'll gowhen I'm ready.

191
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,030
Actually,it is getting late,and I am tired so...

192
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,410
see? You heard the lady.Now...

193
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,360
take off.

194
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,360
Andrew.

195
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,760
It's okay.He's not really that tough.

196
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,130
He knows I would neverhit a child.

197
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,220
Andrew!

198
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,100
George!

199
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,380
Stop it,the two of you,this instant!

200
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,790
This wasa perfectly lovely evening,

201
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,340
and now the both of youhave ruined it.

202
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,540
I will not toleratethis kind of behavior.

203
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,570
Do you understand?

204
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,800
All right,then.

205
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,910
George,we'll see you fridayfor dinner.

206
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,770
I'll be serving fish.

207
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,490
Hey,buddy.

208
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,390
Hey,wake up,sleepyhead.Parker.

209
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,900
Hi. Hiya,pal.

210
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,080

212
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,340
before mommyhas to go to work?

213
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,380
Yeah? Come on.Come on. Come on. Come on.

214
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,930
All right. Oh.

215
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,690
So what do you thinkyou're gonna have,huh? Jelly?

216
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,760
'Cause I thinkI'm gonna have a bear claw.

217
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,280
Stop!

218
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,060
I forgot mrs. Mulberry.

219
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,240
What?

220
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,090
Oh,um,well,since I'm here,

221
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:46,190
maybe she could just relaxin the house for awhile,okay?

222
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,780
No,I need her!

223
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,730
Okay.

224
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,520
Hello,mrs. Mulberry.

225
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,600
Don't forget to buckle up.

226
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,150
Here we go.

227
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,600
Wait!

228
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,700
You forgot her umbrella.

229
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,690
Well,parker,we don't have time.

230
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,150
No!

231
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,820
she needs it.

232
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,640
Hi.

233
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,020
Hey,what are youstill doing here?

234
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,030
I'm lookingfor parker's umbrella.

235
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,910
Have you seen it?No. Nope. Sorry.

236
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,170
Hey,honey,you better hurry.

237
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,410
You're gonna be late for work.

238
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,480
Thank you for that.

239
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,480
I couldn't findmrs. Mulberry's umbrella,

240
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,120
so I brought herher sun hat instead,

241
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,270
all right?

242
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,830
And here we go.It's in the shower.

243
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,690
What?

244
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,130
Mrs. Mulberry saysshe left it in the shower.

245
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,110
Well,why didn'tmrs. Mulberry

246
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,490
volunteer that information

247
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,740
before I turned your roomupside down

248
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,430
looking for it,hmm?

249
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,580
Are you going to go get it?

250
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,980
No,I'm not gonna getthe damn umbrella!

251
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,660
I'm so sorry,sweetie.I am not mad at you.

252
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,820
What are you doing?

253
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,990
Uh...

254
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,380
we don't want doughnuts.

255
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,320
Ahem.

256
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,830
Andrew,you are notleaving the house dressed like that.

257
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,890
I'm just going to meetsome of the guys at the swim club.

258
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,130
I don't care.Put this on.

259
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,820
Every timeyou leave this house,

260
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,950
you represent this family,

261
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,110
and the least you can dois not humiliate us.

262
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,830
A ripped t-shirtis just a look.

263
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,750
Yes,a bad one.

264
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,610
I hope you haven't made plansfor tomorrow night.

265
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,810
Look,if you thinkI'm having dinner

266
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,240
with the pharmacist,you're crazy.

267
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,840
Part of the reasonI'm having him over

268
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,410
is so that youcan get to know him.

269
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,030
Yeah,well,I don't wantto get to know him.

270
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,510
Honey,the feelingsthat you're having

271
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,480
are perfectly normal.

272
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,060
But george isn't tryingto take your father's place.

273
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,970
He's--well,he's just a friend.

274
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,400
Really? Just a friend?

275
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,010
So you're not planningon getting more serious

276
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,040
with this guyin the future?

277
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,530
You know,I haven't eventhought about it.

278
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,970
You're so transparent,it's pathetic.

279
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,730
You're worried abouta ripped t-shirt

280
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,730
humiliating this family?

281
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,230
Wait till people see thatyou're dating the town nerd

282
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,230
less than a month afteryour husband's funeral.

283
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,230
I'll be serving dinnertomorrow night at 7.

284
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,240
Please don't be late.

285
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,020
I'm sorry,but I already have plans.

286
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,780
Andrew,don't you havea meet at the swim club?

287
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,590
Yeah,so?

288
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,490
Doesn't it requirea large entrance fee,

289
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:00,270
one that you can't affordby yourself?

290
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,890
Are you blackmailing meinto coming to dinner?

291
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,010
Oh,you don't knowthe lengths I'd go to for even seating.

292
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,600
Mayer,is this yours?

293
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,060
Blew into my front yard.

294
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,170
Oh,sorry.I'm helping mike find zach.

295
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,060
You know,so we can allrest easy at night.

296
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,470
Uh-huh.And put him in jail?

297
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,070
I don't think mike

298
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,960
would do thatto his own son.

299
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,880
You know?

300
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:35,070
That mike's zach'sreal father? Yes.

301
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,640
Oh. Julie told karl,karl told me,

302
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:42,370
and I,well,sent outa few e-mails.

303
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,220
Well,thanksfor your discretion.

304
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,480
Boy,you would do anything to get mike delfinoto love you.

305
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,960
So what's gonna happento little creepy when he gets here?

306
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,270
Are you gonna betucking him in at night?

307
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,630
Making him breakfastin the morning?

308
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,880
Careful to bob and weave as hetries to blow your head off?

309
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,220
You know,edie,could you just back off?

310
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,780
I mean,the truth is,we're probably nevergonna find zach anyway.

311
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,420
It's a needle in a haystack.

312
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,630
Oh,I see.

313
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,190
And then you'll still come offas little miss perfect,self-sacrificing girlfriend,

314
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,020
putting his needs

315
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,260
ahead of yours.

316
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:22,060
Oh,why,you connivinglittle shrew.

317
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,930
I don't know whywe're not closer.

318
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,320
There was a reason david bradley

319
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,250
was the most successful lawyer in all of fairview.

320
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,600
His arguments were persuasive...

321
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,910
no one ever has to know.

322
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,840
His manner was forceful...

323
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,250
take it off.Take it off.

324
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,850
And he tended to win on appeal.

325
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,830
Please.

326
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,760
And when it came to the more challenging cases,

327
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,420
he knew it was to his advantage

328
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,960
to raise the first objection.

329
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,370
I'm not gonna takeyour case.

330
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,940
What?

331
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,590
yes.

332
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,870
sorry to interrupt,mr. Bradley.

333
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,340
Your dinner just canceled.Want me to pull the reservation?

334
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,350
No,I still have to eat.I'm sorry,where were we?

335
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,700
You were about to turn me down,and then you reconsidered

336
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,660
once you realized I was gonnathrow a ton of money at you,

337
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,670
which I am.

338
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,920
Ah. It's not about the moneyfor me anymore,mrs. Solis.

339
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,230
The fact is,if I don't feelpassionately about a client,

340
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,860
if I don't feelthat fire in my belly,

341
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,030
I don't bringmy a-game to court,

342
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,500
and from what I've read,it'll take my a-gameto save your husband.

343
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,120
Is this aboutthe gay bashing thing?

344
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,600
He's innocent.

345
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,510
He went berserkand attacked a man in court.

346
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,170
Yeah,but that wasa jealousy thing.

347
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,170
The man that my husbandwas trying to kill in court

348
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,960
is not the least bit gay,trust me.

349
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,150
Your file also saysyou're seeking conjugal visits.

350
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,560
Trying to keepthe old marriage alive,huh?

351
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,850
Why does everybodyhave a problem with me having sexwith my husband?

352
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,960
Can I be frank?

353
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,650
Only if it ends with megetting what I want.

354
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,400
Your marriage is doomed.

355
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,210
Excuse me?

356
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,410
I've been doing thisfor a long time,mrs. Solis.

357
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,290
I know what incarcerationcan do to a relationship.

358
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,940
Marriage is hard enough,

359
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,060
but when you throw incement walls,

360
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,480
armed guards,iron bars,

361
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,410
it tends to go downhillrather quickly.

362
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,280
Conjugal visitsnotwithstanding.

363
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:28,720
But I--

364
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,020
listen,you want my advice?

365
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,040
Walk away.

366
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,710
You're young.

367
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,780
You made a mistake.You learn from it.

368
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,980
Maybe next timeyou'll marry smarter.

369
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,750
Now if you'll excuse me,I have dinner reservations.

370
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,170
Reservation.

371
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,190
You're eating alone,remember?

372
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,300
And I have a feelingit's not the first time.

373
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,220
I'm so sorryI couldn't get here sooner.

374
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,990
I forgot my husbandhad to take our youngest

375
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,250
to the pediatricianand...

376
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,570
it's all right,mrs. Scavo.

377
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,690
So...what did parker do?

378
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,680
Are you aware that your sonhas an imaginary friend,

379
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,010
a mrs. Mulberry?

380
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,450
Yes. We've met.

381
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,370
Well,um,yesterday,

382
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,420
parker demanded that

383
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,520
mrs. Mulberry get her own easelduring art,which was fine.

384
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,910
But today it was a desk.

385
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,510
And unfortunately,we didn't have an extra desk.

386
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,990
Oh.

387
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,070
That must have been ugly.

388
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,650
It was.

389
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,200
Patty was rammed

390
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,470
with this.

391
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,690
Oh. I am so sorry.

392
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,840
Mrs. Scavo,

393
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,140
have you experienceda death in your family recently?

394
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,860
No. No. Why?

395
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,900
Imaginary friends are oftencreated as a coping mechanism

396
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,930
to--to deal with loss.

397
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,530
Uh-huh.

398
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,480
Or it might occur as the resultof some major change

399
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,590
or extensive alterationin their lives.

400
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,290
Exactly.

401
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,550
A manifestation ofsome deep-seated unhappiness.

402
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Can you think of anything

403
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,030
that might sheda little bit of light

404
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,170
on this for us?

405
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,960
Mrs. Scavo?

406
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,380
thank you.

407
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,570
And I'm thinking,it's the golden gate bridge.

408
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,110
What a great place to geta picture of the sunset.

409
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,890
So I lean out way over the rail to get the shot.

410
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,220
Next thing I know,the police arrive.

411
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,820
People had called 9-1-1from their cell phones.

412
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,880
Thought I was suicidal.

413
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,000
I can't believe how wellthose two are getting along.

414
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,440
Yeah,it's freaky.

415
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,500
Andrew is beingpolite and engaging.

416
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,180
He's even laughingat george's jokes.

417
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,190
That's whyit's freaky.

418
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,190
George's jokesaren't funny.

419
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,740
so,george,can I ask you a question?

420
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,930
And it's kind of personal.

421
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,350
Sure.

422
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,470
Have you ever actuallybeen with a woman?

423
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,450
Excuse me?

424
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,080
Well,let's be honest.I think it's obvious

425
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,490
by the waythat you talk and act

426
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,590
that you're not a player,

427
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,760
so I was just curiousto find out

428
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,540
if you had ever actuallygotten in the game.

429
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,490
My experience with womenis none of your business.

430
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,640
Oh,I think it is.

431
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,230
I mean,you're dating my mom.

432
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,900
And we both knowthat at your age,

433
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,900
dating's a little morethan just holding hands.

434
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,520
We're not dating exactly.

435
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,200
Oh,sure you are.

436
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,940
And you know what?I think it's great.

437
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,030
But I wanna make suremy mom's happy,

438
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,030
you know,and it wouldreally set my mind at ease

439
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,480
to know that she's with a guythat knows how to please a lady.

440
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,340
This is inappropriate.

441
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,360
You know,my parentshad a great sex life.

442
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,390
Man,I heard 'em throughthe wall of my bedroom once.

443
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,960
Please shut up.

444
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,210
You should've heardmy mom,too.

445
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,350
She had this--this weird moan.

446
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,510
It was kind of like,um... mmm.

447
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,610
Isn't that bizarre?

448
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,780
That's the soundmy mom makes

449
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,240
when she climaxes.

450
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,450
Okay. Time for cobbler.

451
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,120
Sorry,one of the dessert platesdoesn't match.

452
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,130
I tried to replace it,but it's spode florence.

453
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,630
It's a rare pattern.

454
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,750
It belongedto my grandmother.

455
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,390
But hopefully onceyou taste the dessert,

456
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,620
you'll forget all about it.

457
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,980
I'm not hungry.

458
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,280
George,you have to have this.It's absolutely scrumptious.

459
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,100
Mmm.

460
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,150
Mmm!

461
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,360
(Mouths words)

462
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,050
go to your room!

463
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,640
George!

464
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:06,110
You heard me.Go to your room.

465
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,620
Mr. Williams,what's wrong?

466
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,080
Did I say something wrong?

467
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,780
Bree,please back me up.

468
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,130
Well,what did he say?

469
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,270
I can't say. It's too sordid.But he said it!

470
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,430
Are you gonnaback me up or what?

471
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,670
George,I can't allow youto discipline my child

472
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,000
if you won't even tell mewhat he did.

473
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,620
George.

474
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,300
George!

475
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,700
mrs. Solis,david bradley.

476
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,530
Look,I feel really bad about the tone of our meeting,

477
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,700
so to make up for it,I'm gonna do you a favor.

478
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,470
The more I think of it,

479
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,240
the more I'm convinced your marriage is a train wreck--

480
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,300
the gnarly type,you know,mass casualties.

481
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,940
Anyway,I'm passing on the name

482
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,380
of a great divorce lawyer,kir--

483
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,030
you have some nerve,

484
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,070
leaving that messageon my machine.

485
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,170
You realize this isentirely inappropriate?

486
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,940
I will tell youwhat is inappropriate.

487
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,410
You making sweeping assumptions about the state of my marriage.

488
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,530
Care for a drink?

489
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,850
No!

490
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,000
I like to keep a clear headwhen I'm telling people off.

491
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,610
What makes you think you knowanything about me or my husband?

492
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,760
Well,your husband's recordspeaks for itself.

493
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,440
With you,I had to relyon my instincts.

494
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,720
Would those bethe same instincts

495
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,220
that picked outthat cologne?

496
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:39,740
You're privileged.You're pampered.

497
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,910
You're spoiled.

498
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,210
You want what you wantwhen you want it.

499
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,030
You want excitement.

500
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,000
A quickie every five monthsin a prison trailer

501
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,490
isn't gonna scratchthat itch.

502
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,750
With all due respect,I will decide for myself

503
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,930
what needs to be scratchedand when.

504
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,090
Mrs. Solis,you are a beautiful,

505
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,590
desirable woman.

506
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,560
Now your husbandis a dimwit,

507
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,190
corrupt,violent criminal.

508
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,820
You could do...so much better.

509
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,930
Are you hitting on me?

510
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,610
What would you sayif I were?

511
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,580
I'd say I'm pregnant.

512
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,220
So I see,you're stuck.

513
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm not stuck,mr. Bradley.

514
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:27,220
Believe it or not,I love my husband.

515
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,030
I charge $700 an hour,

516
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,160
plus xeroxing.

517
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:32,870
I'll pay you 6,

518
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,960
and I expect a conjugal visittomorrow by noon.

519
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,110
Aren't you demanding?

520
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,460
Like you said...

521
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,970
I want what I wantwhen I want it.

522
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,360
So a womanI talked to at social services

523
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,450
said a lot of runawayshang out here.

524
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,420
What?

525
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,410
Just happy to bespending the day with you.

526
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,970
At homeless sheltersand bus stations?

527
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,360
I'm gonna go ask these guysif they've seen zach.

528
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,910
I think we'll covermore ground if we split up.

529
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,440
Okay.

530
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,480
Thanks.

531
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,210
Have you seen this boy?

532
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,970
Uh,missing kid. Anyone?

533
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,260
Going once...

534
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,200
going twice?

535
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,810
Oh,do you mind keeping those

536
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,360
and passing them outwhen people get their ice cream?

537
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,980
Huh.

538
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:40,880
What?

539
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:44,050
Well,isn't that him,over there?

540
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,600
Oh!

541
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,510
Zach! Zach!

542
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,930
Oh,no,no,no,no.

543
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,990
No,no,no,no.

544
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,440
Don't,don't,don't,don'T.Zach!

545
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,090
Don't,don'T.Zach,don't run away!

546
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,170
Wait! Come on!

547
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,850
Just--would youget back here?!

548
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,180
Come on,really!Let's just talk!

549
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,040
Damn it,zach!

550
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,960
It's enough already.

551
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,440
Aah!Oh!

552
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,100
Uh...

553
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,540
nobody herehas seen zach.

554
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,400
But there's a halfway house

555
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,340
on the westsideI want to check... out.

556
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,040
Are you okay?

557
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,930
I got you some ice cream.

558
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,030
You did?

559
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,550
But then I got hungry.

560
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,620
So then I just threwmy ice cream at him and ran.

561
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,840
Well,somebody say something.

562
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,530
Thank godyou were in flats.

563
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:55,450
I'm still recovering frommike is zach's real father.

564
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,210
I should've told mikeI saw zach.

565
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,880
I'm a horrible person,right?

566
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,290
Oh,susan,come on.

567
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,420
Zach attacked felicia.He blew up your kitchen.

568
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,990
Evidently,he tried to kill mike.

569
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,750
I think we can all agreethis kid's a freak.

570
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,060
What do you think,bree?

571
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:19,370
Well,I think given everythingthat's happened,

572
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:23,870
it's perfectly justified thatyou'd be frightened of zach.

573
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,990
But...

574
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,460
but zachis mary alice's son.

575
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,650
He grew up playingin our yards.

576
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,810
If he has any hopeof surviving,

577
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:39,020
I have to believe he's betteroff here than on the streets.

578
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:44,930
I couldn't have imagined

579
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,390
how much going back to workwould upset parker.

580
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:51,300
Look,he's going to be fine.He's just gotta get used

581
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,040
to daddy providingall the love.

582
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,460
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

583
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,700
I am kidding.

584
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,200
Look,kids are resilient.He will adapt.

585
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,390
Tom,he attacked a teacherwith an umbrella.

586
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,170
It was a poke.He poked her.

587
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,360
I don't know.

588
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,530
Maybe I shouldn'tbe working.

589
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,550
The kids wouldcertainly benefit

590
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,600
from havingtwo stay-at-home parents,

591
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,060
although buying foodmight become an issue.

592
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,820
Maybe I could changemy work schedule,

593
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,670
try and get some flex time.

594
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,950
Would nina go for that?

595
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,340
No. No.

596
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,590
No,no,no!

597
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,230
No,no,no!

598
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,580
It would help if youcame up with some ideas.

599
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,080
How about hugs?

600
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:29,680
Hugs?

601
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,180
Yeah,I read inone of those family magazines

602
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,400
the kids are supposedto get,like,ten hugs a day.

603
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,110
It makes 'em feelmore secure.

604
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,160
I say pile on the hugs.

605
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,850
That'll fix everything?Hugs?

606
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,750
Yeah. Come here.

607
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,540
come here.

608
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,480
Hey.

609
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,330
Hi.

610
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,290
It's working,isn't it?

611
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,080
Shut up.

612
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,890
Hey,buddy,you busy?

613
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,770
Yes. Mrs. Mulberry'sreading to me.

614
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,300
Well,isn't she nice?

615
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,960
But it's time for bed,so I'mgonna tuck you in,okay?

616
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,120
I'll take that.

617
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,760
No!

618
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,080
I know thingshave been hard for you

619
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,580
since I started backto work,

620
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,910
but it is just as hard for meto be away from you.

621
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,070
And you just haveto remember

622
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,270
that even whenI'm not around,

623
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,960
my love for you is real.

624
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,430
You may not be ableto see it,

625
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,070
but it's not imaginarylike mrs. Mulberry.

626
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,670
It's real.

627
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,830
Okay,honey?

628
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,090
Mrs. Mulberry is real,

629
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,640
and she said you're a liar.

630
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,660
Parker.

631
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,590
Parker.

632
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,150
We're reading.

633
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,800
I don't understand.

634
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,540
Why can't we see each otheranymore?

635
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,920
Because ever since I found outwhat andrew said to you,

636
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,580
I've been doingsome soul searching,

637
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,160
and I realize thateverything's that happened

638
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,590
is completely my fault.

639
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,200
No,no,no,

640
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,530
that's ridiculous.No,it's not.

641
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,410
All the thingsthat andrew's been saying

642
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,110
and the wayhe's been acting,

643
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,960
it's all connectedto his father's death.

644
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,880
And it's clear to me

645
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,160
that I need to spend more timefocusing on him and his needs.

646
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,980
You know...

647
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,560
you're right. You do needto focus on andrew.

648
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,430
Thank you,george,for being so understanding.

649
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,200
Of course.

650
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,790
So have you thoughtabout counseling?

651
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,820
That placeyou sent him to--

652
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,260
that behavioralmodification camp--

653
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,660
he got counseling there,right?

654
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,710
But I only sent him there

655
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:13,280
because his behavior at the timewas so completely out of bounds.

656
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,620
You don't think that whathe said to me was out of bounds?

657
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,750
I just think if I spenta lot of time with him,

658
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,040
it'll really help.Why not do both?

659
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,160
Let him spend a few monthswith some caring professionals,

660
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,030
and then bring him home.

661
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,440
You know,what he saidto you was horribly rude,

662
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,310
but that camp,it's extreme,

663
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,670
and,I mean,unless I feltlike andrew was getting

664
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,630
really out of control,then...

665
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,850
well,let's hopeit doesn't come to that.

666
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,870
You know,in spite ofeverything that's happened,

667
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,140
I really like andrew.

668
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,930
Oh,george,really?

669
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,220
Yeah. The truth is...

670
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,820
he reminds me of me.

671
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,760
The conjugal visit rules areyou got 45 minutes.

672
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,340
We call every 15 minutesto make sure you're still here.

673
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,250
You understand?

674
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,410
Yes,we got it.

675
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,950
Uh,we interrupt our lovemakingto answer the phone,

676
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,740
or you call out the dogs.Okay!

677
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,490
I'm ready whenever you...

678
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,680
obviously are.

679
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,490
Carlos,are we gonna make it?

680
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:31,240
We just did.You want to go again?

681
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,940
No,I'm talkingabout us--

682
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,640
our relationship,our marriage.

683
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,510
Carlos,you're goingto be a father.

684
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,890
And when you get outta here,you're gonna need to get a job

685
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:47,500
and make an honest livingfor me and our child.

686
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,430
Babe,I've learned my lesson.

687
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:53,500
Okay,when I get out of here,everything's gonna be different.

688
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,100
We're going to start over witha new life and a great family,

689
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:01,390
and nothing is going toget in the way of that.

690
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,990
Hey,so you never told me--

691
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,210
how's the new lawyer?You like him?

692
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,960
yeah.

693
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,770
Yeah,I'm still here.

694
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,950
Okay,enough chitchat.We only have 30 minutes left,

695
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:32,880
and I want to makethe most of it.

696
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,940
Okay,please--please don't run.

697
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,090
I can'T. I hurt my foot.

698
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,490
How?

699
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,200
I landed on it funny whenI was running away from you.

700
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,710
What do you want?

701
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,340
To talk to you.

702
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,320
Why?

703
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,340
'Cause I havea lot of things to say.

704
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,680
So you can just listen.I'll buy you some food.

705
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,890
When was the last timeyou ate?

706
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,660
My dad's alive?Where is he?

707
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,890
I don't know.He disappeared.

708
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:23,700
But mike did not kill him.I mean,he's alive,you swear?

709
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,540
I swear.Maybe he's in utah.

710
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:29,400
I know that he used tohave a life there--

711
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,100
before me.

712
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,290
I don't know.I just--I just--

713
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,490
I need to get some moneyand find him.

714
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,670
Zach,you know what I think?

715
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,070
I think you should come back with me.Why?

716
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,390
Because there are still peopleat home that care about you.

717
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:44,680
And there's thingsthat you need to know.

718
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,660
Like what?

719
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,220
Well,I can't tell you.

720
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,350
You know,you messed upa lot of people's lives,zach.

721
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,550
You can't run awayfrom that.

722
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,650
Do you mean julie?

723
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,670
What?

724
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,330
I know that I messed upher life,

725
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,690
but I didn't mean to.

726
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,610
I really miss herout here.

727
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,010
I think about herall the time.

728
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,960
Yeah,well,julie'sa really special girl.

729
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,460
Has she said anythingabout me?

730
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,700
Because if she has,then I mightstill have a chance with her.

731
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,150
If I come backwith you,

732
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,480
then I-I couldmake it up to her.

733
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,430
Do you know what I think?

734
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,180
I think you were right.

735
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:35,730
I think you shouldtry to find your father first.

736
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,790
Yeah?Yeah.

737
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,720
I mean,now that you know he's okay,

738
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,010
you should go to him.

739
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,540
He'll want totake care of you.

740
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,710
That's what parents do.

741
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,850
Let me help.

742
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,880
How much money do you thinkyou'll need to get to utah?

743
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:53,790
Daddy,I can't findmrs. Mulberry's umbrella.

744
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:54,620
Where is it?

745
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,300
Oh,I don't know,sport. Honey,have you seen the umbrella?

746
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,490
No,can't say that I have.

747
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,250
Okay,listen,don't worry about it.

748
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,540
I'm sure mrs. Mulberry'saround here somewhere.

749
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:08,230
Or,uh,maybe she's not.

750
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,500
She could've left.You know...

751
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,680
maybe she had someother little boy

752
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,980
that she needed to help.

753
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,740
Like who?

754
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:21,280
I don't know. It could bea little boy in,uh...

755
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,350
england...

756
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,010
named... spencer.

757
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:27,900
Lynette?

758
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,560
I mean,this isconjecture on my part.

759
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:35,610
But it is possible thatsomeone like little spencer

760
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:40,580
needs mrs. Mulberry more,'cause he doesn't have a daddy

761
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,000
and a mommy who love him.

762
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,490
Yeah,that's it.

763
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,870
He's an orphan...

764
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:50,220
with no hands.

765
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,320
Okay?

766
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,620
You're so sweet. Come here.I love you. You all right?

767
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,830
Okay,go get dressed.

768
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,680
What have you doneto mrs. Mulberry?

769
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:05,610
Until there's a body,there's no evidence of a crime.

770
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,410
Mrs. Mulberry!

771
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,520
She's back!

772
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,990

774
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,220

00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:43,040

780
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,250

I thought about what you said,and you're right.

784
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,270
Andrew needs his space.

786
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,870
It'S...best that I stay away.

And I completely understand

788
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,920

789
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,660
I did want to give youa little good-bye gift.

790
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,840

791
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,380

792
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,380
It's my pattern!Where did you find it?

793
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:42,100
I got luckyon an online auction.

794
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,010
I love it! Thank you! Oh!

795
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,480

796
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,000
Oh,george!

797
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,420
George.

798
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,260
George.

799
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,770
Andrew,what are you doing?!

800
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,670
Andrew!

801
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,050
Get off of him,andrew!

802
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,370
Stop it!

803
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,280
Knock it off!

804
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,370
Did you see him?!He was kissing her!

805
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,920
Oh,my god,you're bleeding.

806
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,080
That freak was kissing her!

807
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:30,520
I don't care.You gotta calm down now.

808
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,800
The world is filled with good fathers.

809
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,390
How do we recognize them?

810
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:53,170
They're the ones who are missed so terribly

811
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,530
that everything falls apart in their absence.

812
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,630
They're the ones who love us

813
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,500
long before we've even arrived.

814
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,340
They're the ones who come looking for us

815
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,180
when we can't find our way home.

816
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,710
hey,what's wrong?

817
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,550
Because of me,

818
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:35,050
my son's imaginary friendgot crushed by a garbage truck.

819
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:41,490
I am the worst personin the world.

820
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,580
Yes,the world is filled with good fathers...

821
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:50,700
honey,he is going to getover this in no time. Trust me.

822
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:53,470
And one daywhen he is all grown up,

823
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:57,540
you and parker are going tolaugh hysterically about this.

824
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,790
You really think so?Really?

825
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,230
And the best

826
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:04,840
are the ones who make the women in their lives...

827
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,940
I promise.

828
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,040
Feel like good mothers.
