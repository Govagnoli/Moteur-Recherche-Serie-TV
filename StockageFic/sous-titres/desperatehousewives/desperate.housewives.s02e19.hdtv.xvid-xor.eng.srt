<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:04,234
sounds to me as if someone's
let go of his rage.

3
00:00:04,268 --> 00:00:07,201
Maybe i have.
Well, <i>i</i> haven't.

4
00:00:07,234 --> 00:00:09,534
<i>Felicia took matters</i>
<i>into her own hands.</i>

5
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:12,101
You want me to call off
the weddin i'll do it.

6
00:00:12,134 --> 00:00:14,467
I'll do whatever you want.
<i>Karl put the ball</i>
<i>in susan's court...</i>

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,400
with your d.u.i. Charge,
it could get ugly.

8
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:19,634
<i>While andrew tried</i>
<i>to take bree to court...</i>

9
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:22,367
(carlos) there's a father.
He's a kid!

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,101
<i>Gabrielle and carlos</i>
<i>took the baby...</i>
the papers aren't valid anymore.

11
00:00:25,134 --> 00:00:27,168
Do y really wanna leave
this beautiful little girl

12
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:29,400
with that
white trash freak show?

13
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:30,934
<i>And ran with it.</i>

14
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:36,734
<i>(mary alice) louispate</i>
<i>believed in the power of shame.</i>

15
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:38,433
<i>As a teacher,</i>

16
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:40,700
<i>she had found that the best way</i>
<i>to control unruly students</i>

17
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:44,268
<i>was to instill</i>
<i>a strong sense of shame...</i>

18
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,967
<i>in their parents.</i>

19
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:48,234
I left trisha alone
with the school hamster

20
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:49,967
for only five minutes.

21
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:55,134
In this box
is all that's left of patches.

22
00:00:57,168 --> 00:01:00,134
For show and tell, timmy decided
to bring in something

23
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:03,500
from your husband's collection
of nazi memorabilia.

24
00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:07,700
Billy's been threatening
to beat up the other kids

25
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,201
for their milk money.

26
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:11,234
We found the proceeds
in his cubby.

27
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:15,967
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>mrs. Pate also knew</i>

28
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:18,400
<i>when it came</i>
<i>to unruly children,</i>

29
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:21,734
<i>some parents had more reason</i>
<i>to be ashamed...</i>

30
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:23,433
<i>than others.</i>

31
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:27,967
So, um... your message said
that parker had been involved

32
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:30,234
in some sort
of serious incident.

33
00:01:30,268 --> 00:01:31,667
What... what kind
of incident?

34
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,467
Yesterday afternoon,

35
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,667
parker offered a cookie
to cindy lou peeples

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,567
if she would
show him her vagina.

37
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,467
What kind of cookie?

38
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,400
What does that matter?

39
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:44,967
Oh, it doesn't.

40
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:47,534
I'm just stalling because
i am completely mortified.

41
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:50,534
The kids were in a broom closet.
Our janitor walked in on them

42
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:54,168
just as cindy
was lifting up her pinafore.
Oh, my goodness.

43
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:56,234
I'm sure you've noticed
how obsessive parker can be.

44
00:01:56,268 --> 00:01:58,234
A certain subject
will catch his interest,

45
00:01:58,268 --> 00:02:00,500
and that's all he'll talk about
for weeks and weeks.

46
00:02:00,534 --> 00:02:03,067
Oh, right.
That happened with dinosaurs.

47
00:02:03,101 --> 00:02:05,067
Oh, yes, we all remember
his dinosaur phase.

48
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:07,500
More fondly now than ever.

49
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:11,767
Mm-hmm, so you think
that now he's obsessed with...

50
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:13,934
what's underneath
the pinafore. Yes.

51
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,834
Look, i think
he's just developed

52
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:19,534
a normal curiosity
about the human body.

53
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:21,634
You need to talk to him.

54
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,600
Remind him what's appropriate
and what isn't.

55
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:25,600
Of course.
I will talk to him.

56
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:28,101
I'll talk to him
till i'm blue in the face.

57
00:02:28,134 --> 00:02:30,201
I promise. Take care.

58
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:34,634
<i>Yes, louisa pate believed</i>
<i>in the power of shame.</i>

59
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:38,067
<i>She always believed,</i>
<i>when someone has that power...</i>

60
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:40,500
so, mrs. Peeples,
you'll never guess

61
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:43,700
what your daughter is willing
to do for a gingersnap.

62
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:46,767
<i>It's a shame not to use it.</i>

Oh, thank god i found you.
This place is a maze.

78
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:02,022
What are you doing here?

79
00:04:02,056 --> 00:04:05,355
Well, your father and i got
a call last night from danielle,

80
00:04:05,388 --> 00:04:08,455
and she said that andrew
was taking you to court.

81
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:10,056
(scoffs) i mean,

82
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:12,288
to say that we were shocked
would be an understatement.

83
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:14,989
Hello, i'm eleanor mason,
bree's stepmother.

84
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,856
You're the lawyer?
We should talk.

85
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,689
Uh, no,
i'm not her lawyer.

86
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:20,922
Good.
The hair had me worried.

87
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:23,622
Peter is mom's sponsor
from a.a.

88
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:25,756
Oh, sweetie! (chuckles)

89
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:28,089
Since when are you
in a.a.?

90
00:04:28,123 --> 00:04:30,288
It's a recent development.
Where's dad?

91
00:04:30,322 --> 00:04:32,422
In chambers with the judge.

92
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:34,522
What?! Why?

93
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:36,022
Everything is fine.

94
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:38,156
The judge agreed
to a postponement.

95
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:39,789
Oh, thank god!

96
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:42,288
Luckily, he remembered me.
I spoke once at his law school.

97
00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:44,822
Pardon me, sir,
i'm your daughter's lawyer.

98
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:46,355
Just so you know,

99
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:48,856
we've been waiting
for this hearing for weeks,

100
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,056
son, i've been an attorney
for 45 years.

101
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:52,555
You and i both know

102
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:55,322
how these cases can
turn into public spectacles.

103
00:04:55,355 --> 00:05:00,056
Our family is perfectly capae
of handling this in house.

104
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:02,956
Dad, you don't understand.
This has gotten really ugly.

105
00:05:02,989 --> 00:05:04,889
That's why we're here.

106
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:07,689
We're gonna put this family
back together.

107
00:05:07,722 --> 00:05:10,089
Whatever it takes.

108
00:05:15,156 --> 00:05:17,922
(beale) and that's
when mr. And mrs. Solis,

109
00:05:17,956 --> 00:05:20,322
fearing for the welfare
of this helpless child,

110
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:21,922
fled the hospital.

111
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:24,555
You mean,
they kidnapped her.

112
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:26,722
Well,
technically, that's true,

113
00:05:26,756 --> 00:05:29,388
but given the situation
that led up to the rescue...

114
00:05:29,422 --> 00:05:31,922
kidnapping.

115
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:35,056
Your honor,
yes, in retrospect,

116
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:38,022
the plan was a little bit rash,
not entirely well thought out.

117
00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:39,223
Idiotic.

118
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,555
(whispers)
Can we object to that?
Shh!

119
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:43,555
But the child <i>is</i> safe,
your honor.

120
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:47,355
And all we ask the court
is to allow baby lily

121
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,223
a lifetime
of the care and love

122
00:05:50,255 --> 00:05:53,189
she has been receiving
from the solises.

123
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,956
As much as your story
tugs at my heart,

124
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:00,956
there is the issue
of parental rights.

125
00:06:00,989 --> 00:06:02,922
What does the state
have to say about this?

126
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:06,288
We have located
the biological father...

127
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:07,989
mr. Dale helm.

128
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:10,956
Unfortunately, uh, circumstanceses
require that he be out of town.

129
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:12,589
He's in fort lauderdale today.

130
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,789
On business?

131
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:15,989
Spring break, actually.

132
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:18,089
Mr. Helm is
a high school student.

133
00:06:18,123 --> 00:06:21,589
Charming. In between keg stands,
did the father happen to mention

134
00:06:21,622 --> 00:06:25,689
if he plans
to waive parental rights?

135
00:06:25,722 --> 00:06:27,689
I've left
a number of voice mails,

136
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:30,689
but the only response
i've gotten is a text message

137
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:35,422
that says this "blows his mind"
and he's extremely "bummed out."

138
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:42,089
All right...

139
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:46,056
mr. And mrs. Solis,
since you actually want lily,

140
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:49,089
it seems you're
the lesser of two evils.

141
00:06:49,123 --> 00:06:51,223
I'm granting you
temporary custody

142
00:06:51,255 --> 00:06:54,455
until we can get a straight
answer from the birth father.

143
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:56,489
Thank you,
uh, your honor.

144
00:06:56,522 --> 00:06:59,822
In the meantime, try not
to steal any more babies.

145
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:02,856
Oh, we just needed the one.
(chuckles)

146
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:11,156
Sweetie?

147
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:13,689
Um, could you put
the crayons down for a second?

148
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:15,856
We need to talk.

149
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:17,422
So i spoke
to your teacher today,

150
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:19,522
and she told me
about the...

151
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:23,989
cookie deal
you made with cindy lou.

152
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:26,255
Oh. Are you mad?

153
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:29,756
(chuckles) no, not exactly.
I'm just...

154
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:32,756
i'm trying to understand
why you...

155
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:34,123
did that.

156
00:07:34,156 --> 00:07:36,756
Tommy keenan told me
babies come from down there.

157
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,756
It doesn't
sound right to me.

158
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:40,722
Well...

159
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:43,689
actually, he's kinda right.
He's got the concept down.

160
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:47,123
That's weird.
How's a by get in there?

161
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:56,689
Daddy will be home from
his business trip in a few days.

162
00:07:56,722 --> 00:07:58,689
Why don't you
wait for him?

163
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:01,056
Okay.
Okay.

164
00:08:02,522 --> 00:08:04,756
Or i can ask
tommy's brother.

165
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:08,388
He's 14,
and he knows everything.

166
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:12,922
And then
the mommy and the daddy,

167
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:15,056
because they love each other
so much,

168
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:16,255
they <i>hug.</i>

169
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,522
<i>Real</i> tight.

170
00:08:18,555 --> 00:08:22,189
And, uh, a seed
is magically implanted.

171
00:08:22,223 --> 00:08:24,422
(clucks)
And nine months later...

172
00:08:24,455 --> 00:08:26,589
a baby is born. Here.

173
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:28,089
What kind of seed?

174
00:08:28,123 --> 00:08:31,555
Oh, that's not important.

175
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:33,455
I don't believe you.

176
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:38,255
Parker, i'm your mother.
Mothers don't lie to their sons.

177
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:41,822
Now go wash your hands

178
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:44,355
or santa's not gonna bring you
anything for christmas.

179
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,089
I just saw edie drive off.
How long is she gonna be gone?

180
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:54,255
I don't know.
She just went to show a house.

181
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:55,889
Move.

182
00:08:55,922 --> 00:08:58,622
What's the problem?

183
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:01,156
You mauled me
in edie's bed last night.

184
00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:03,322
I think that deserves
a conversation.

185
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:06,422
Well, what's there to talk
about? I'm just a fool in love.

186
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:09,455
Oh, no!
You don't mean that.

187
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:12,989
Yes, i do. Look, i realize
my timing's a little off.

188
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:14,655
(scoffs) a little?

189
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:17,388
Ugh... the helium hasn't even
gone out of the balloons

190
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:19,355
from your engagement party.

191
00:09:19,388 --> 00:09:23,455
(sighs) okay...
when are you gonna tell edie?
Tell her what?

192
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:25,123
That the wedding's off.
Is it?

193
00:09:25,156 --> 00:09:27,422
Well, isn't it?
It's up to you.

194
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:29,388
Are... are you saying...

195
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:31,522
that you're gonna
go through with this wedding...

196
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:33,522
unless i tell you not to?

197
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:35,555
Just give me a commitment,
susie q.,

198
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:38,722
and i'll put a bullet
in edie.
This is insane!

199
00:09:38,756 --> 00:09:41,388
Come on.

200
00:09:41,422 --> 00:09:43,789
All this
can be yours again.

201
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:47,223
Ju say the word...
and i let go.

202
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:50,022
Oh, no!
No, don't you dare!

203
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,056
You know you want me to.
Just say it, susie q.

204
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:55,689
You're...

205
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:56,722
sick!

206
00:09:56,756 --> 00:09:59,388
(chuckling)

207
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:02,123
Zach,
i'm going to the drugstore.

208
00:10:02,156 --> 00:10:04,655
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

209
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:08,789
Oh!

210
00:10:21,856 --> 00:10:24,555
Paul?!

211
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:28,722
I was making cookies, and i
heard the most sickening thud.

212
00:10:28,756 --> 00:10:30,355
Are you okay?

213
00:10:30,388 --> 00:10:31,622
There's...

214
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:34,056
shortening on my doorstep.

215
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:35,622
Shortening?

216
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:38,756
That's the last thing
you'd want on your front porch.

217
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:40,956
It's meant for baking.

218
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:54,229
it was
my grandmother's name.

219
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:56,729
So how you holding up?
You must be exhausted.

220
00:10:56,763 --> 00:10:59,195
You know, i'm a little tired,
but it's not too bad.
Oh, wait a couple months.

221
00:10:59,229 --> 00:11:01,962
She'll start
sleeping through the night.

222
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,229
Oh, honey, please.
Do i look like a masochist?

223
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:05,962
Firs thing tomorrow, i'm hiring
a nanny and a night nurse.

224
00:11:05,995 --> 00:11:08,029
No, we're not.

225
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:10,828
(laughs)
My husband, the comedian.

226
00:11:10,862 --> 00:11:13,429
I'm serious. I don't want
some stranger raising our baby.

227
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:15,462
Well, you guys are busy.
We should go.

228
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:17,262
Mm-hmm.

229
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:19,828
No, it's okay.
I'll win this battle later.

230
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:22,629
We are not gonna be
some yuppie couple

231
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:25,895
pawning off our kid on other
people. End of discussion.

232
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:27,396
Yeah, you should go.

233
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:28,895
Yeah.
Okay, bye.

234
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:29,928
Good luck.

235
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:37,529
Put down the burrito.

236
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:40,529
What is all this crap
about me not getting help?

237
00:11:40,562 --> 00:11:43,529
Look, a brand-new baby
needs to bond with its mother.

238
00:11:43,562 --> 00:11:46,296
The church knows it, science
knows it, nature knows it.

239
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:48,995
We have the money. What is wrong
with getting a little help?

240
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:50,995
Then i'll be able
to relax once in a while,

241
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:52,663
and i'll be able
to <i>be</i> a better mother.

242
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:54,663
You wanna be
a better mother?

243
00:11:54,696 --> 00:11:56,696
Do what my <i>mam*</i> did...
make sacrifices.

244
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:59,062
My <i>mam*</i> worked her fingers
to the bone for me.

245
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:01,596
And that's what put her
in an early grave!

246
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:06,763
Well, that
and the hit-and-run thing.

247
00:12:14,663 --> 00:12:17,529
Look, i don't know why
you want to be emancipated,

248
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:20,296
and i don't know what you've
been doing to drive him crazy.

249
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:22,596
Bottom line... it's over.

250
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:26,529
It's now time for you two
to kiss and make up.

251
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:31,362
And just how
are we supposed to do that?

252
00:12:31,396 --> 00:12:33,429
Here's a thought...

253
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,795
just look each other
in the eye and say,

254
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:37,329
"i forgive you."

255
00:12:40,095 --> 00:12:42,596
(laughs)
<i>That's</i> your solution?

256
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,095
It's actually
a technique invent

257
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:46,062
by this dutch therapist.

258
00:12:46,095 --> 00:12:47,562
I saw him on tv.

259
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:49,828
He says,
if you verbalize forgiveness,

260
00:12:49,862 --> 00:12:53,629
the brain can trick the heart
into letting go of resentment.

261
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:55,162
It really works.

262
00:12:55,195 --> 00:12:57,195
I did it
with our cleaning lady.

263
00:12:57,229 --> 00:13:01,663
Um, i'm sorry, dad, but i think
my relationship with andrew

264
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:04,095
is just a bit more complicated
than...

265
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:06,396
would it kill you
to at least try?

266
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:09,129
I'll do it...
for you, grandpa.

267
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:11,895
That's my boy. Bree?

268
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:16,396
Fine!

269
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,928
Yes, um...
so, um, who goes first?

270
00:13:19,962 --> 00:13:22,928
Either or.
Doesn't matter.

271
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:28,362
Mom, i forgive you.

272
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:31,362
Andrew, i forgive you.

273
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,962
That wasn't so hard, was it?

274
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:38,362
Now don't expect
to feel differently right away.

275
00:13:38,396 --> 00:13:42,229
It takes a while.
It took me a week
to forgive esperanza.

276
00:13:42,262 --> 00:13:45,962
But now
she's like family again.
Family who stole from us.

277
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:48,562
So let's get back
to the waye were,

278
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:52,895
and forget all this nonsense
about emancipation.

279
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:54,095
Um...

280
00:13:56,429 --> 00:14:00,396
well, grandpa, i'm... i'm still
gonna need my trust fund.

281
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:02,529
You see,
l-i can't live in a place

282
00:14:02,562 --> 00:14:04,562
where i...
i don't feel safe.

283
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,729
What are you talking about?

284
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,596
Well, could you live
with a woman who hits you?

285
00:14:12,596 --> 00:14:15,795
Bree!
I slapped him once,
and he deserved it.

286
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:17,995
Well, i just asked her
to stop drinking.

287
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:19,429
You were drinking?

288
00:14:19,462 --> 00:14:22,262
She's in a.a.
Her sponsor has long hair.

289
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:24,162
Andrew,
i find your concern ironic,

290
00:14:24,195 --> 00:14:26,162
given how tanked you were
when you ran or

291
00:14:26,195 --> 00:14:28,562
our neighbor's mother
with your car.

292
00:14:28,596 --> 00:14:31,729
Is she okay?
She's dead!

293
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:33,062
Well...

294
00:14:33,095 --> 00:14:35,995
mom watched as her boyfriend
committed suicide.

295
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:38,596
<i>And</i> he was the same guy
who killed dad!

296
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:42,663
Andrew falsely accused me
of molestation...

297
00:14:42,696 --> 00:14:45,296
in a mall!

298
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:50,262
You know,
the technique works best

299
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:52,296
if you don't talk right away.

300
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:58,663
Okay, let's go. I don't wanna
be late for the movie.

301
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:01,496
Oh, those are pretty.
Who sent those?

302
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:04,296
What?

303
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:06,596
"Say the word and i'm yours.
Love, karl."

304
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:08,562
Mom, i knew
this would happen

305
00:15:08,596 --> 00:15:10,396
when you started
hanging around together,

306
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:12,362
all of your old feelings
resurfacing.

307
00:15:12,396 --> 00:15:13,862
No, <i>his</i> feelings.

308
00:15:13,895 --> 00:15:15,995
<i>He's</i> the one
with the feelings, not me.

309
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:17,562
Uh-huh.

310
00:15:17,596 --> 00:15:20,229
Okay, don't "uh-huh" me. You're
not old enough to do that.

311
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:22,729
Oh, no?
Well, how do you like this...

312
00:15:22,763 --> 00:15:25,496
i'm not gonna go
to the movies with you.
You're gonna make me
go by myself?

313
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,496
Well, you could always
ask dad to go.

314
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:29,496
In fact,
if you love him so much,

315
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,195
why don't you marry him?

316
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:33,229
Oh, wait, you already did.
<i>Twice.</i>

317
00:15:33,262 --> 00:15:35,129
(sighs)

318
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:38,329
(indistinct conversations)

319
00:15:51,229 --> 00:15:53,895
(woman) hey, carol,
come on. Sit with us.

320
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:02,496
Oh, you know what?

321
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,795
I think we're gonna need
some napkins with this.

322
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:07,229
Oh, okay, i'll go back.
Thanks.

323
00:16:07,262 --> 00:16:09,696
My ex-boyfriend's here.
If he sees me alone, i'll die.

324
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:11,696
I'm begging you, please,
act like you know me.

325
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:14,229
Susan? Hey!

326
00:16:14,262 --> 00:16:16,696
Mike, hi! (chuckles)
What a surprise.

327
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:20,995
How are ya?
Good.

328
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:23,596
Oh!
God, l... i'm being so rude.

329
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:27,229
Um, mike,
l-i want you to meet...

330
00:16:27,262 --> 00:16:29,496
orson hodge.

331
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:32,396
Nice to meet you, mike.

332
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:33,928
Wow, i can't believe

333
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:36,396
i'm finally seeing
the man himself in the flesh.

334
00:16:38,396 --> 00:16:41,663
So... how'd you two meet?

335
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:44,429
Oh, god, i've been
her dentist for years.

336
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:45,795
(susan chuckles)

337
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:47,596
But last week,
i was looking in her mouth

338
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:49,629
and decided
to stick my tongue in it.

339
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:55,729
I'll see ya, susan.

340
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:01,529
Thank you so much
for helping me out.

341
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,529
Hey,
i'm great in a crisis.

342
00:17:05,095 --> 00:17:09,029
Well, i definitely picked
the right person to sit next to.

343
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:11,729
Actually,
is this seat taken?

344
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:13,795
No.

345
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:17,029
Okay, you can share
my popcorn.

346
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:19,362
Um, susan...

347
00:17:19,396 --> 00:17:20,895
this is becky.

348
00:17:20,928 --> 00:17:22,928
I'll probably be sharing
<i>her</i> popcorn.

349
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:28,162
I'll just wait
till the lights go out,

350
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:29,696
and then i'll...

351
00:17:35,828 --> 00:17:38,795
while i get this going,
can you bring out the buns?

352
00:17:38,828 --> 00:17:40,062
Uh, yeah.

353
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,229
(whoosh)

354
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,828
What the hell?
You all right?

355
00:17:51,828 --> 00:17:54,129
This isn't lighter fluid.
It's gasoline.

356
00:17:54,162 --> 00:17:55,396
What?

357
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:57,995
How'd that get in there?

358
00:17:58,029 --> 00:17:59,696
How do you think?

359
00:18:04,195 --> 00:18:06,195
Something smells good
over there.

360
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:11,862
Well, i don't understand.
Is she trying to kill you?

361
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:14,729
No, she's trying
to piss me off.

362
00:18:14,763 --> 00:18:16,362
Why?

363
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,329
I'm not sure yet,

364
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:20,763
but i do know
i'm not gonna play along.

365
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:23,496
We got plenty of burgers
if you want to pop over.

366
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:25,795
And bring your appetite.

367
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:34,429
Gaby, the baby.

368
00:18:36,352 --> 00:18:38,853
No, i got up twice already.
It's your turn.

369
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:40,796
Gaby, i have several
job interviews tomorrow.

370
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,228
I need my sleep.

371
00:18:43,262 --> 00:18:45,762
What about <i>my</i> sleep?

372
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,063
You sleep
when the baby sleeps.

373
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:53,562
Every 40 minutes?

374
00:18:53,596 --> 00:18:55,796
When am i supposed
to have a life?

375
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:57,596
What are you whining about?

376
00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:00,195
You know, xiao-mel does
all the housework around here.

377
00:19:00,228 --> 00:19:02,829
All you have to do
is take care of the baby.

378
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:04,329
Fine, fine, fine!

379
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:09,082
Psst!

380
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,583
(whispers) xiao-mei.

381
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,282
Psst, wake up.

382
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:14,715
Mrs. Solis?

383
00:19:14,748 --> 00:19:16,316
Something wrong?

384
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:18,848
(normal voice)
The baby won't stop crying,

385
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:20,848
and i haven't slept
for two days.

386
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:22,949
Will you please
take lily for a while?
Uh...

387
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:26,115
oh, come on. I won't make you
do windows tomorrow.

388
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:29,082
Okay. What do i do?

389
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:31,649
Well, she's a baby.
You hold her.

390
00:19:31,683 --> 00:19:33,149
You bounce her

391
00:19:33,182 --> 00:19:36,349
and, i don't know,
maybe sing a little something.

392
00:19:36,382 --> 00:19:38,616
Ahh.

393
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:40,349
Oh, and xiao-mei,

394
00:19:40,382 --> 00:19:43,216
mr. Solis does not need
to know about this, okay?
Okay.

395
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,149
Okay.

396
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:50,249
(singing in chinese)

397
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:52,915
Yeah, honey, can you
take that downstairs?

398
00:19:52,949 --> 00:19:54,516
Thank you.

399
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:04,316
Eleanor,
i thought you'd gone to bed.

400
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:06,815
Oh, no, not yet.
I had to do my hair now.

401
00:20:06,848 --> 00:20:09,216
There's never enough time
in the morning.

402
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,882
Uh, sit.

403
00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:14,382
There's something
i have to discuss with you.

404
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,882
Your father and i
have decided to take andrew

405
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,416
back to rhode island
with us.

406
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:20,349
Really?

407
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:22,449
And whose idea was that?

408
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:24,382
Andrew's.

409
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:28,416
But henry and i feel
it's the right thing to do.

410
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:31,049
Absolutely not.

411
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:36,049
If we leave him here,

412
00:20:36,082 --> 00:20:38,549
the two of you
will wind up in court,

413
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,549
and i'm not
going to all that.

414
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,216
Do you really think

415
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:45,249
that i am enjong airing
my dirty laundry in public?

416
00:20:45,282 --> 00:20:48,782
This whole sittion
is mortifying.

417
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:51,249
But i can't back down
because he is my son,

418
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:53,782
and i need more timeto get th

419
00:20:53,815 --> 00:20:57,316
you never give up.

420
00:20:57,349 --> 00:21:00,516
I've always admired that
about you.

421
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:02,015
When you were a kid,

422
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:04,349
you used to make
these peanut butter cookies

423
00:21:04,382 --> 00:21:06,249
that were god-awful.

424
00:21:06,282 --> 00:21:07,915
But you kept baking them,

425
00:21:07,949 --> 00:21:11,216
and you kept forcing everyone
to eat them.

426
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:12,482
(chuckles)

427
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:15,748
You were so determined
to get them right.

428
00:21:15,782 --> 00:21:18,782
My mother didn't think
they were awful.

429
00:21:18,815 --> 00:21:22,316
When i made those same cookies
for her, she loved them.

430
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:25,082
Well, some people
praise children

431
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:27,182
even when
they don't deserve it.

432
00:21:27,216 --> 00:21:28,782
Oh, but not you.

433
00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:32,249
With you, i had to work for
every kind word i ever got.

434
00:21:32,282 --> 00:21:35,316
Well, you always resented me
because of my high standards.

435
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:37,082
No.

436
00:21:37,115 --> 00:21:38,616
I resented you

437
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:41,082
because those were kick-ass
peanut butter cookies.

438
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:45,683
We're taking andrew.

439
00:21:45,715 --> 00:21:48,382
Eleanor, please...

440
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,516
he hates you, bree.

441
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:53,616
Your own son.

442
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:55,915
You know,
part of being an adult

443
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:58,549
is admitting
that you've failed,

444
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,882
and then moving on...

445
00:22:00,915 --> 00:22:02,416
with grace.

446
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:09,316
Do you really think that i am
a failure as a parent?

447
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:13,015
(sighs) well, i'd love to lie
and say something supportive,

448
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:15,015
but as you pointed out,

449
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:18,549
that was more
your mother's thing.

450
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:30,316
Xiao-mei?

451
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,349
So sorry.
I just take break.

452
00:22:32,382 --> 00:22:34,349
Oh, no, xiao-mei,
that's okay. That's okay.

453
00:22:34,382 --> 00:22:36,848
I know you were up all night
with the baby,

454
00:22:36,882 --> 00:22:38,915
and i really
appreciate it.

455
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:41,249
You know,
i'm very grateful

456
00:22:41,282 --> 00:22:43,416
for everything
you've been doing for lily.

457
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:45,949
So to thank you, i bought you
a gift certificate to my spa.

458
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:49,115
And you can take a whole day off
and just really pamper yourself.

459
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:50,616
Really?
Mm-hmm.

460
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:52,182
Thank you!

461
00:22:52,216 --> 00:22:53,583
Oh, thank you!

462
00:22:53,616 --> 00:22:55,149
Oh, you're welcome.

463
00:22:55,182 --> 00:22:57,583
All right, lily needs
to be bathed and put to bed.

464
00:22:57,616 --> 00:23:00,549
I don't wanna miss
my yoga class. Hi.

465
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:04,583
Hi, pretty girl.
Oh, yes, mommy has to go.

466
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,282
Mommy has to go,

467
00:23:06,316 --> 00:23:09,382
so she can stay pretty and thin
and you can be proud of her.

468
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,649
(chuckles)

469
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,848
Motherhood
is such a blessing.

470
00:23:13,882 --> 00:23:16,349
I hopeou get
to experience it one day.

471
00:23:17,848 --> 00:23:21,115
(front door opens, shuts)

472
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,115
(andrew) because
it's <i>not</i> a big deal!

473
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:25,282
(justin)
"It's not a big deal"? Okay!

474
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:27,616
It's not that far away.
Right. Oh, it's not
that far away?

475
00:23:27,649 --> 00:23:29,382
Dude, it...
whatever, okay?

476
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,049
You didn't even care
to tell me before?
Bye.

477
00:23:34,316 --> 00:23:36,316
(sighs)

478
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:38,182
Justin, what happened?

479
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:41,216
Andrew just told me he's
moving in with his grandparents.

480
00:23:41,249 --> 00:23:43,216
They live so far away,

481
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:45,082
i'm never gonna
see him anymore.

482
00:23:45,115 --> 00:23:47,549
I'm <i>so</i> sorry. I know
that you're good friends.

483
00:23:49,848 --> 00:23:53,949
We're more than friends,
mrs. Van de kamp.

484
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:55,449
I love him.

485
00:23:55,482 --> 00:23:57,982
Oh.

486
00:23:59,882 --> 00:24:01,015
Why?

487
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:02,748
Why?

488
00:24:02,782 --> 00:24:04,748
Yes.
I'd be curious to know

489
00:24:04,782 --> 00:24:07,848
just what it is
you see in him.

490
00:24:07,882 --> 00:24:10,782
Well, when my parents
first heard i was gay,

491
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:12,748
they kicked me out.

492
00:24:12,782 --> 00:24:15,715
They said i had debased
the entire family

493
00:24:15,748 --> 00:24:18,216
and that they couldn't
love me anymore

494
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,049
until i changed.

495
00:24:20,082 --> 00:24:23,683
But andrew... he said that
<i>i</i> should be ashamed of <i>them,</i>

496
00:24:23,715 --> 00:24:27,748
'cause they were too stupid
to know how great i was.

497
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:30,249
That's the thing
about andrew.

498
00:24:30,282 --> 00:24:32,349
He doesn't take crap
from anyone.

499
00:24:32,382 --> 00:24:35,249
How can you not
love someone like that?

500
00:24:35,282 --> 00:24:37,748
You know,
it never ceases to amaze me

501
00:24:37,782 --> 00:24:40,748
how people can turn their backs
on their own family.

502
00:24:40,782 --> 00:24:43,182
I mean... but it happens
every day, doesn't it?

503
00:24:43,216 --> 00:24:44,748
I guess.

504
00:24:44,782 --> 00:24:48,349
You know, justin, if you
would be willing to help,

505
00:24:48,382 --> 00:24:49,915
i'm pretty sure

506
00:24:49,949 --> 00:24:52,848
that i could find a way
to keep andrew from moving.

507
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:55,516
What do you say?

508
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,049
I'm home.

509
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,049
Oh, hi.

510
00:25:02,082 --> 00:25:03,549
Hey, mrs. Mccluskey.

511
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:06,449
So how did everything go?

512
00:25:06,482 --> 00:25:09,915
Fine. Penny fussed a bit.

513
00:25:09,949 --> 00:25:12,216
I think her molars
are coming in.
Oh.

514
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:14,216
And the twins
fought over the remote.

515
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:16,915
There's nothing new there.
No. (chuckles)

516
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:18,649
Here's the big news...

517
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,583
parker offered me a fudgsicle
if i would show him my vagina.

518
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:27,516
Oh, good god, lynette, relax.
I didn't do it.

519
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:30,282
I just got this
out of the freezer a second ago.

520
00:25:30,316 --> 00:25:32,282
Uh, yeah. Of course.
No, sorry.

521
00:25:32,316 --> 00:25:34,782
Apparently, parker wanted to put
a sunflower seed inside me

522
00:25:34,815 --> 00:25:38,282
and see if a baby would grow.
Where do kids get this stuff?

523
00:25:38,316 --> 00:25:40,115
Oh... that was me.

524
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:42,616
He was asking about
the birds and the bees,

525
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:45,082
and i fudged
a few of the details.

526
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:49,249
Well,
he's only 7 years old.

527
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:51,882
I don't think he needs
to know everything yet.

528
00:25:51,915 --> 00:25:54,549
I don't wanna rob him
of his innocence.

529
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:56,549
Well, now,
that's where you're wrong.

530
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:59,282
You get 'em
when they're young.

531
00:25:59,316 --> 00:26:01,282
Give them
all the gory details.

532
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:03,915
And then when they're good
and disgusted, you shame 'em.

533
00:26:03,949 --> 00:26:06,449
Excuse me?

534
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,616
You tell them
sex is dirty and wrong

535
00:26:08,649 --> 00:26:10,549
and he shouldn't
talk about it,

536
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:12,549
and if he does,
he's going straight to hell.

537
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:15,549
(laughing)
That is ridiculous.

538
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:17,748
Spoken like
a true liberal idiot.

539
00:26:17,782 --> 00:26:19,482
No, i'm not
gonna shame my son.

540
00:26:19,516 --> 00:26:21,815
Mm, i'm telling ya,
it works.

541
00:26:21,848 --> 00:26:24,182
It keeps people
in their place,

542
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:26,683
it keeps parents
from being humiliated,

543
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:28,915
and it keeps me from
having to spend the afternoon

544
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:30,583
talking about my woo-woo.

545
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:40,759
In your haste to duck out before
the credits rolled, you...

546
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:44,592
oh, my god!
Oh, thank you so much.

547
00:26:44,626 --> 00:26:47,425
I stuck a card in there,
just in case you ever wanted

548
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:49,425
to purposely sit next to me
at a movie, so...

549
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:53,492
orson, i'm flattered.
Uh, really.

550
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:56,026
(sighs) you...
you don't wanna date me.

551
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:59,225
L-i mean, my love life is just
so complicated right now.

552
00:26:59,258 --> 00:27:03,292
Well... no, i won't bore you
with the details.

553
00:27:03,325 --> 00:27:06,158
So the ex-boyfriend has no idea
you're secretly married

554
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:08,158
to the ex-husband,
who still loves you,

555
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:10,492
but unless you give him
a reason not to,

556
00:27:10,525 --> 00:27:12,626
is gonna marry
the neighborhood slut?

557
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:14,659
Did i call edie a slut?
Mm-hmm.

558
00:27:14,692 --> 00:27:16,692
Well, that's overstating it.
Edie's not a slut.

559
00:27:16,726 --> 00:27:19,759
She's just... popular
with indiscriminate men.

560
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:22,492
Anyway... yes, those are
the relevant players.

561
00:27:22,525 --> 00:27:24,459
Okay.
Now i'm absolutely
horrified

562
00:27:24,492 --> 00:27:26,926
that i'm about to say
what i'm about to say,

563
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,425
but there's nobody else i can
talk to who won't judge me.

564
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:31,425
And since
you're a complete stranger,

565
00:27:31,459 --> 00:27:33,525
i'll probably
never see you again

566
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:35,859
unless i randomly
run into you on the street,

567
00:27:35,892 --> 00:27:39,492
in which case, you'll ignore me
'cau you know how crazy i am.

568
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:40,993
So here goes...

569
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,392
i'm having feelings
for karl again.

570
00:27:44,425 --> 00:27:47,459
(sighs) does that make me
a terrible person?

571
00:27:47,492 --> 00:27:50,626
You want
my unvarnished opinion?

572
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:52,525
Lay it on me.

573
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,559
It doesn't make you
a terrible person,

574
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:56,626
but it does make you a...

575
00:27:56,659 --> 00:27:59,026
well... a sucker.

576
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:00,859
This karl's a coward.

577
00:28:00,892 --> 00:28:04,225
He wants you to be the heavy
and take all the responsibility.

578
00:28:04,258 --> 00:28:05,892
If you're having feelings
for a guy like that,

579
00:28:05,926 --> 00:28:07,892
i say run...
far, far away.

580
00:28:07,926 --> 00:28:09,892
He lives three houses down.

581
00:28:09,926 --> 00:28:12,192
Hmm.
Well, good luck to you, then.

582
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:19,292
But like i said, if you're
interested in a tooth whitening,

583
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:21,325
my card's
still in your wallet.

584
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:29,158
Xiao-mei?

585
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,759
Xiao-mei?

586
00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:35,225
I'm late to meet
mrs. Van de kamp.

587
00:28:35,258 --> 00:28:37,258
I'll be back
in a little while.

588
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:42,158
(indistinct conversations)

589
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:46,692
Bree...
i'm so sorry i'm late.

590
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:48,225
Oh, honey,
it's all right.

591
00:28:48,258 --> 00:28:50,192
I mean,
with the new baby at home,

592
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:52,492
i'm surprised
you made it at all.

593
00:28:52,525 --> 00:28:54,626
Ooh, i'll have a drink.
Anything with an umbrella.

594
00:28:56,726 --> 00:29:00,192
So tell me,
how are you doing?

595
00:29:00,225 --> 00:29:02,692
I mean, your entire world
must be turned upside down.

596
00:29:02,726 --> 00:29:05,026
You must be exhausted.

597
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:08,258
You know, it's been challenging,
but l-i soldier on. (chuckles)

598
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:10,692
So what about you?
You look so rested.

599
00:29:10,726 --> 00:29:12,726
I just got a massage
at misty spring.

600
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,726
Things have been
a little tense at home,

601
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,726
and i needed an hour
to relax.

602
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,726
Good for you.
I love that spa.

603
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,192
Mm. Um, oh, by the way,
while i was there,

604
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:23,225
i saw your, uh,
your housekeeper.

605
00:29:23,258 --> 00:29:25,059
Xiao-mei?

606
00:29:25,093 --> 00:29:27,059
Oh, no,
you must be mistaken.

607
00:29:27,093 --> 00:29:29,626
I just left r.
She's at home working.

608
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:32,626
Are you sure? I was talking
to her in the steam room

609
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:35,225
for about 20 minutes.
What?

610
00:29:35,258 --> 00:29:37,859
Yeah, apparently you gave her
a gift certificate.

611
00:29:45,258 --> 00:29:47,225
Lily?

612
00:29:47,258 --> 00:29:49,959
Lily, mommy's coming!

613
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:55,959
Oh, thank god!
Oh, honey, i'm so sorry.

614
00:29:55,993 --> 00:29:58,325
I'm never gonna
leave you again. Oh!

615
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,392
Yes. Yes.

616
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:05,492
I'm home!

617
00:30:05,525 --> 00:30:07,792
My interview got canceled.

618
00:30:07,826 --> 00:30:10,826
(cooing)
Oh, that's my little girl.

619
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:13,425
Your chakra lining up nice
for mommy?

620
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,292
That's my girl.

621
00:30:17,325 --> 00:30:20,626
(chuckles) hey,
let me take her off your chest

622
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:22,125
so you can do your yoga.

623
00:30:22,158 --> 00:30:24,626
No! No, no, no.
We're doing just fine.

624
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,325
Aren't we, lily?

625
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:34,659
(playing rock version
of "hava nagila")

626
00:30:39,525 --> 00:30:42,158
Bridezilla's got me
auditioning wedding bands,

627
00:30:42,192 --> 00:30:44,158
and i'm clueless about
edie's taste in music.

628
00:30:44,192 --> 00:30:46,158
What do you think
of these guys?

629
00:30:46,192 --> 00:30:48,292
That's why
you brought me down here?
Mm-hmm.

630
00:30:48,325 --> 00:30:50,392
Karl, you made it sound like
it was an emergency.

631
00:30:50,425 --> 00:30:52,993
It is! I need to have somebody
to dance with so i can see

632
00:30:53,026 --> 00:30:56,525
if these guys have the power
to help me get my groove on.

633
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,059
Karl...
uh-oh!

634
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,325
Oh, that's right.

635
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,325
You like it laid-back
and romantic, don't you?

636
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:05,325
Guys, can we play
something mellow?

637
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:07,325
No, don't bother,
'cause i'm going.

638
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,826
(drumstick clicks)
(man) two...

639
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:15,726
that was not
a coincidence.

640
00:31:18,592 --> 00:31:20,559
This was playing
the night we first kissed.

641
00:31:23,525 --> 00:31:25,859
I remember.
I also remember that

642
00:31:25,892 --> 00:31:27,926
you are planning
on marrying someone else.

643
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:29,826
Not if you don't
want me to.

644
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:32,425
Come on, susie q.

645
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:34,926
I can see you still
have feelings for me,

646
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:38,192
and i know i have
never stopped loving you.

647
00:31:38,225 --> 00:31:39,692
Okay, you want the truth?

648
00:31:39,726 --> 00:31:41,692
I don't know
how i feel about you,

649
00:31:41,726 --> 00:31:43,692
but i keep looking at you,

650
00:31:43,726 --> 00:31:46,492
trying to see if you've changed,
if you've grown up.

651
00:31:46,525 --> 00:31:48,026
You know what i see?

652
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:50,026
I see the same weak coward

653
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:52,559
that walked out on me
three years ago.

654
00:31:52,592 --> 00:31:54,525
Of course i've changed.

655
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,125
I don't think so.

656
00:31:57,993 --> 00:32:01,626
so i think you should
probably stay with edie.

657
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:09,258
and the band is good.
You should hire 'em.

658
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:40,225
What the hell?

659
00:32:42,826 --> 00:32:44,292
For god's sakes...

660
00:32:44,325 --> 00:32:46,392
what the hell
are you doing in there?!

661
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:48,359
This is my house.
What are you doing?

662
00:32:48,392 --> 00:32:50,125
We're tenting for termites.
We got a work order.

663
00:32:50,158 --> 00:32:51,659
Signed by who?

664
00:32:51,692 --> 00:32:53,093
Paul...

665
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:56,425
i've never been so embarrassed
in my whole life.

666
00:32:56,459 --> 00:32:58,659
They're supposed
to be tenting my house.

667
00:32:58,692 --> 00:33:01,592
I must've written
the address down wrong.

668
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:05,292
(haltingly) <i>muchachos,</i>
<i>mi casa est* aqu^.</i>

669
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:07,225
You've taken it too far
this time.

670
00:33:07,258 --> 00:33:09,792
These little mind games
are gonna stopop right now!

671
00:33:11,592 --> 00:33:14,392
(lowers voice) and if
they don't, whatcha gonna do?

672
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:16,692
Blow out your brains
like your wife did?

673
00:33:18,258 --> 00:33:20,325
(man) hey, hey!

674
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:23,459
Hey, you okay?
Did you hear that?

675
00:33:23,492 --> 00:33:25,759
He assaulted me
for an honest mistake.

676
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:28,225
God knows what would've happened
if you hadn't been here.

677
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:29,225
Let go!

678
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:30,492
Dad, dad, dad.
Come on.

679
00:33:31,692 --> 00:33:34,192
Come on.
Come on, okay?

680
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:43,459
I talked to mrs. Mccluskey,
and for god's sakes, parker,

681
00:33:43,492 --> 00:33:46,059
you <i>can'task people</i>
things like that.

682
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:47,158
Why?

683
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,359
Because...

684
00:33:49,392 --> 00:33:50,559
it's rude.

685
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,859
I said "please."

686
00:33:51,892 --> 00:33:54,026
Well, that doesn't matter!

687
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:58,093
You gotta quit talking
to people about their bodies,

688
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:00,525
and about where, you know,
babies come from.

689
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,292
Why?

690
00:34:02,325 --> 00:34:05,125
Because it's not
an appropriate subject.

691
00:34:05,158 --> 00:34:06,225
Why?

692
00:34:06,258 --> 00:34:08,026
Because it's not.

693
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:09,258
Why?

694
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:11,258
Ugh!
Because it's dirty and wrong,

695
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:14,759
and i'll wash your mouth out
with soap! That's why.

696
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:16,626
<i>In that moment,</i>

697
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,659
<i>lynette saw a look</i>
<i>on her son's face</i>

698
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:21,525
<i>she had never seen before...</i>

699
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,026
<i>and she thought of the look</i>
<i>he had on his face</i>

700
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:26,993
<i>when he had become obsessed</i>
<i>with dinosaurs...</i>

701
00:34:27,026 --> 00:34:29,059
<i>obsessed with baseball</i>

702
00:34:29,093 --> 00:34:31,492
<i>and obsessed with trains.</i>

703
00:34:31,525 --> 00:34:33,459
<i>And it occurred to lynette</i>

704
00:34:33,492 --> 00:34:36,325
<i>she didn't need</i>
<i>to shame her son.</i>

705
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:41,258
<i>All he needed was</i>
<i>a brand-new obsession.</i>

706
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:43,759
But i thought you said
we couldn't have a puppy.

707
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:46,993
Well... it turns out
we really needed one.

708
00:34:47,026 --> 00:34:49,325
You can go and play.

709
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,325
<i>And though she didn't know it</i>
<i>at the time,</i>

710
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:54,325
<i>it would be another three years</i>

711
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:59,792
<i>before parker scavo would</i>
<i>ever ask about sex again.</i>

712
00:35:01,993 --> 00:35:04,492
Karl. What's going on?

713
00:35:04,525 --> 00:35:06,492
Uh, i'm on my way
to a motel.

714
00:35:06,525 --> 00:35:09,192
L-i just wanted to let you know
that the wedding is off.

715
00:35:09,225 --> 00:35:10,926
It is?

716
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:13,425
I told edie
i wasn't in love with her...

717
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:15,826
at least, not in the way
that she deserves.

718
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:17,993
Wow.

719
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,993
Why did you change
your mind?

720
00:35:22,026 --> 00:35:24,926
I mean, i hope it wasn't because
of me, because i told you...
it wasn't for you.

721
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:26,692
No?

722
00:35:26,726 --> 00:35:29,959
You were right.

723
00:35:29,993 --> 00:35:31,592
I have been a coward.

724
00:35:31,626 --> 00:35:33,959
I was a coward three years ago
when i walked out

725
00:35:33,993 --> 00:35:35,959
on the two most important people
in my life.

726
00:35:35,993 --> 00:35:38,859
And i was being a coward
with edie.

727
00:35:38,892 --> 00:35:42,392
(chuckles) i mean,
to even consider marrying her

728
00:35:42,425 --> 00:35:48,292
when i know what real passion
and real love feels like.

729
00:35:49,826 --> 00:35:54,158
Anyway, l-l-i just thought
i'd let you know.

730
00:35:54,192 --> 00:35:56,325
Karl...

731
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:01,459
you look pretty beat up.

732
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,258
Why... why don't you...
why don't you come in and...

733
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:08,258
we'll crack open
a bottle of wine.

734
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:09,459
Come on.

735
00:36:13,959 --> 00:36:15,926
All right, here we go.

736
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:18,059
This is the last
of andrew's things.

737
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:20,926
Once we tape up these boxes,
we can start loading the car.

738
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,425
I'm proud of you, bree.

739
00:36:22,459 --> 00:36:24,559
You're being awfully big
about this.

740
00:36:24,592 --> 00:36:28,093
Well, i have to admit,
i was a bit upset at first.

741
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:30,892
But then it hit me.
You're his grandparents.

742
00:36:30,926 --> 00:36:34,059
You should bond,
get to know the real andrew.

743
00:36:34,093 --> 00:36:35,392
(gasps)

744
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:37,392
Oh, dad,
l-i forgot to warn you.

745
00:36:37,425 --> 00:36:39,392
These are some
of andrew's adult videos.

746
00:36:39,425 --> 00:36:41,926
I don't approve,
but boys will be boys.

747
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:47,392
Oh, henry,
stop looking at that filth.

748
00:36:47,425 --> 00:36:49,892
I don't get it.

749
00:36:49,926 --> 00:36:51,392
Where are the women?

750
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:53,726
What are you talking about?

751
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:57,026
This is all just a bunch of...
naked men.

752
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:00,792
Sweet mother of god.
What the hell are they doing?

753
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:04,626
I don't know, and i don't
even know what i'm looking at.

754
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:07,125
Henry, this is pornography
for ho-homosexuals.

755
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,926
Oh, shoot! I wish you
hadn't gone through that.

756
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:12,392
Now we have to have
an unpleasant conversation,

757
00:37:12,425 --> 00:37:14,392
and we were having
such a nice time.

758
00:37:14,425 --> 00:37:16,425
Bree, is...

759
00:37:16,459 --> 00:37:19,093
is andrew... gay?

760
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:22,292
Oh, dad, andrew <i>hates</i> labels.
I'm sure it's just a phase.

761
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:23,826
Excuse me,

762
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:26,559
but he has a magaze titled
"leather daddies in love."

763
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:29,158
That does not sound like
a phase to me.

764
00:37:29,192 --> 00:37:31,659
Maybe not, but it's no longer
<i>my</i> concern

765
00:37:31,692 --> 00:37:34,026
now that he'll be living
with <i>you.</i>

766
00:37:35,492 --> 00:37:38,993
We have to have
a serious talk.

767
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:41,926
Let's don't freak out
about this.

768
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,559
The dutch therapist says...

769
00:37:43,592 --> 00:37:47,158
forget the dutch therapist!
In the kitchen!

770
00:37:47,192 --> 00:37:48,759
(eleanor) now!

771
00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:55,142
Hey,
where's grandma and grandpa?

772
00:37:55,176 --> 00:37:57,142
I need to start
loading up my stuff.

773
00:37:57,176 --> 00:37:59,176
Oh, they, uh,
they already left.

774
00:37:59,209 --> 00:38:01,642
Wait... they left?

775
00:38:01,675 --> 00:38:02,842
Without me?

776
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:05,542
Uh, yeah,
they wrote you a letter.

777
00:38:09,608 --> 00:38:13,242
It seems they came across
some personal items of yours

778
00:38:13,276 --> 00:38:14,909
that, um, upset them.

779
00:38:14,942 --> 00:38:17,343
They're taking away
my trust fund?

780
00:38:17,376 --> 00:38:19,276
They can't do that!

781
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:21,042
Well, actually they can.

782
00:38:21,076 --> 00:38:24,942
I mean, it's their money to
dispense with as they see fit.

783
00:38:24,976 --> 00:38:27,542
I know
it doesn't seem fair, but...

784
00:38:27,575 --> 00:38:30,575
no, it's <i>really</i> unfair.
In fact, it sucks.

785
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,042
What... what am i supposed
to do now?

786
00:38:33,076 --> 00:38:35,542
Well, now that you can't afford
to become emancipated,

787
00:38:35,575 --> 00:38:38,475
i guess you're gonna
have to stay here with me.

788
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:41,909
Andrew,
we can make this work.

789
00:38:41,942 --> 00:38:44,443
We just have
to let go of our anger.

790
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:47,409
No.

791
00:38:49,742 --> 00:38:51,709
Oh, i, um, had a chance

792
00:38:51,742 --> 00:38:54,842
to have a nice chat
with justin the other day.

793
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,742
He really seems very sweet.

794
00:38:56,775 --> 00:38:58,642
I've invited him over
for dinner tonight.

795
00:38:58,675 --> 00:39:00,675
I hope you don't mind.

796
00:39:09,409 --> 00:39:11,909
Now i wish i hadn't
torched our wedding photos.

797
00:39:11,942 --> 00:39:13,942
(chuckles)

798
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,608
Who would've thought,

799
00:39:15,642 --> 00:39:17,276
after everything
that's happened,

800
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:19,608
that we would've
ended up back here again?

801
00:39:19,642 --> 00:39:22,176
It's been
one hell of a ride, huh?

802
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:23,709
Yeah.

803
00:39:25,475 --> 00:39:27,775
(sighs)
So how do you feel now?

804
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:28,775
About us?

805
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:30,508
Mm.

806
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:33,343
I feel good. (giggles)

807
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,076
I feel happy.

808
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:37,642
You're not having
second thoughts?

809
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,642
I can't believe you actually
want to talk about feelings.

810
00:39:40,675 --> 00:39:42,142
You really <i>have</i> changed.

811
00:39:42,176 --> 00:39:44,142
Hey, this is the new karl,
baby.

812
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:46,176
He's not afraid to cry.
(chuckles)

813
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:49,608
(telephone rings)

814
00:39:50,942 --> 00:39:51,909
Hello?

815
00:39:51,942 --> 00:39:52,909
(sighs)

816
00:39:52,942 --> 00:39:55,276
Oh, hi, edie.

817
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:58,142
Uh... yeah, he's here.

818
00:39:58,176 --> 00:39:59,376
Hold on.

819
00:39:59,409 --> 00:40:01,742
(whispering) how does
she know you're here?

820
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:04,076
(whispers) i don't know.

821
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:06,809
(normal voice) hi. Ahem.

822
00:40:06,842 --> 00:40:09,809
Yeah, i just came by to help
julie with her civics homework.

823
00:40:09,842 --> 00:40:12,276
Uh-huh.

824
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:16,309
Okay, i'll take care of it.
What kind of juice do you want?

825
00:40:16,343 --> 00:40:18,409
Right. Bye, bye.

826
00:40:18,443 --> 00:40:20,409
Are you getting juice
for her?

827
00:40:20,443 --> 00:40:22,742
Yeah, just one carton.

828
00:40:22,775 --> 00:40:24,809
You ripped
the woman's heart out.

829
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:27,508
Why would she want juice
from <i>you?</i>

830
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:29,575
Okay. (clears throat)
Now don't freak out,

831
00:40:29,608 --> 00:40:32,142
but this breakup is
sort of a work in progress.

832
00:40:32,176 --> 00:40:34,709
She doesn't know?
Will you calm down?
I can explain.

833
00:40:34,742 --> 00:40:37,575
So if edie doesn't know,
then that means

834
00:40:37,608 --> 00:40:40,376
that you just cheated
on her... with me!

835
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:44,508
You made <i>me</i> the other woman!
Please don't be angry.
I tried to break up with her,

836
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,608
but because i wasn't sure
you wanted me back,

837
00:40:46,642 --> 00:40:48,675
the words just wouldn't
come out of my mouth.

838
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:50,775
Now that i kw that
you want me and love me again,

839
00:40:50,809 --> 00:40:52,443
it's a done deal.

840
00:40:52,475 --> 00:40:55,742
(susan) get out of my house,
you miserable son of a bitch!

841
00:40:55,775 --> 00:40:57,675
(karl)
Can't we talk about this?

842
00:40:57,709 --> 00:40:59,675
No, just get out!
Get out!

843
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:02,042
Susie, susie!
Our marriage was garbage!

844
00:41:02,076 --> 00:41:05,042
Stupid, disgusting
pile of garbage!
No, no, don't say that.

845
00:41:05,076 --> 00:41:08,042
And i regret everything
that came of it!
Don't do this right now.

846
00:41:08,076 --> 00:41:10,409
Ugh! Except you, honey.
You're my rock.

847
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:12,109
Ooh, out! Get out!

848
00:41:12,142 --> 00:41:13,742
I...
ugh!

849
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:16,709
I promise you i'm gonna break up
th edie and make this right.

850
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:19,443
I'll call you
when it's done.
Don't bother!
I won't pick up.

851
00:41:19,475 --> 00:41:20,875
(door slams)

852
00:41:28,142 --> 00:41:32,742
<i>We've all done something</i>
<i>in our lives we're ashamed of.</i>

853
00:41:32,775 --> 00:41:36,909
<i>Some of us have fallen</i>
<i>for the wrong man.</i>

854
00:41:36,942 --> 00:41:41,575
<i>Some have let go</i>
<i>of the right woman.</i>

855
00:41:41,608 --> 00:41:46,142
<i>There are those who have</i>
<i>humiliated their parents...</i>

856
00:41:48,508 --> 00:41:53,343
<i>and those who have failed</i>
<i>their children.</i>

857
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:55,009
<i>Yes,</i>

858
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:59,942
<i>we've all made mistakes that</i>
<i>diminish us and those we love.</i>

859
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:02,742
<i>But there is redemption</i>

860
00:42:02,775 --> 00:42:06,042
<i>if we try to learn from</i>
<i>those mistakes... and grow.</i>
