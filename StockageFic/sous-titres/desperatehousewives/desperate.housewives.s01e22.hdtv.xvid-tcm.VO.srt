1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,000
<font color=yellow>previously on "desperate housewives"...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,500
My electronic monitoring device.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
I'm on house arrest.
It's a condition of my bail.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,300
<font color=yellow>Investigations began.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,900
I need you to check into 
someone else's background.

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,600
There's this plumber I know.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,200
<font color=yellow>Boundaries were pushed.

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,200
Bree, you are not going to regret 
taking this journey with me.

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,200
<font color=yellow>And the news...

10
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,100
So Peterson called me into his office today.

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,200
<font color=yellow>Went from bad...

12
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,300
He changed his mind.
He's going to hold that promotion for Duggan.

13
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,400
<font color=yellow>To worse.

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,900
I'm pregnant, and it might be yours.

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:40,200
<font color=yellow>Edie Britt's favorite moment of every day was her arrival
at the construction site of her new home,

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,500
<font color=yellow>because she knew what was about to happen.

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,200
<font color=yellow>Her sudden appearance was always sure to 
generate a few appreciative glances,

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,600
<font color=yellow>a few appreciative glances, a few lascivious looks,
and some downright ogling.

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,400
<font color=yellow>Sadly for Edie, the one man 
she wanted most to notice her...

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,500
<font color=yellow>paid her no attention at all.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,500
<font color=yellow>Yes, Edie needed attention to 
feel good about herself,

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,300
<font color=yellow>and she was determined to get it.

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,000
Ms. Britt, you look extra beautiful today.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,600
Oh, Cyrus, you're so sweet.

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,500
So anyhow, I --
I was wondering if, uh...

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,500
maybe I could, uh...
take you out to dinner sometime.

27
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,700
Oh, honey...

28
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,900
you are so far out of your league that 
you're playing a completely different sport.

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,100
Hey there.

30
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,100
Well, hey, Edie. 
What's up?

31
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,500
Nice ensemble. 
You busy?

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Ha ha. No, not really.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,700
Oh, good.

34
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,000
I bought a bunch of fresh doughnuts
for my construction workers, and as you can see,

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,700
bought a few too many,
so I thought maybe you and I could --

36
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,400
Susan.

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,600
Hey there, Edie.

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,200
Wh-- what are you --

39
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,300
Mike and I got back together.

40
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,200
Ha ha. Super.

41
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,000
I knew you'd be happy for us.
So what's going on?

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,500
Uh, Edie was just about to --

43
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
Free doughnuts. Want 'em or not?

44
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,200
How sweet. Thanks.

45
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,300
Why don't you go put these on a plate?

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,600
Oh, and save me one with sprinkles.

47
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,500
I cannot believe you are still 
coming on to him.

48
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,900
You said you two were finished.

49
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,300
You thought he was a murderer.

50
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,300
And that was your cue to 
come over and flirt?

51
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,400
You wasted your time and your doughnuts.

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,900
Not if you choke on them.

53
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,100
Well, thanks, Edie. 
The doughnuts look great.

54
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,400
A pleasure.
See ya.

55
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,500
You know, I'm going to run home and 
get some milk to go with those doughnuts.

56
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,600
Hey, you know, it's --
it's a shame you got to keep running back and forth.

57
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,300
Well, I can't have doughnuts 
and juice. It's unnatural.

58
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,900
No, I mean... we should move in together.

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Come on. What do you say?

60
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Oh. Um...
I-I say, um, oh.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,600
Um...
hold that thought.

62
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,100
Edie! Edie! Stop!

63
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,800
Oh, hang on!

64
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
What now?

65
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,200
Oh, I was just rude back there,
gloating and everything, and I apologize.

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,000
Well, thank you, Susan.
That's very big of you.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,100
And on a completely unrelated topic,

68
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,300
Mike and I are moving in together.
See ya.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,900
<font color=yellow>Yes, Edie Britt needed the attention of men
to feel good about herself.

70
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,700
Hey, Cyrus.
You have lunch plans?

71
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,600
No.

72
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,600
<font color=yellow>And even she was amazed at how far
she was willing to go to get it.

73
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,100
Ellsburg hotel -- half an hour.

90
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,100
<font color=yellow>Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Mullins
were finally leaving Wisteria Lane.

91
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,200
<font color=yellow>In the past year, their street 
had played host to arson,

92
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,500
<font color=yellow>violence, blackmail, and murder.

93
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,800
<font color=yellow>Fearing they, too, would be infected by 
this moral decay,

94
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,600
<font color=yellow>the Mullins felt it was time to say goodbye.

95
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,400
<font color=yellow>Strangely enough, none of their neighbors
seemed to notice they were moving out.

96
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,300
Hey.

97
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
I thought you might be thirsty.

98
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,100
Nah, I'm good.

99
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,800
So how's your roommate doing?

100
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,700
He's  hanging in there.

101
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,400
Yeah, well, I had to, um...

102
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,800
tell him some news that was --
it was a little bit upsetting for him.

103
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,100
No kidding.

104
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,800
Excuse me?

105
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,300
Where do you get off telling John
he's not good enough to raise a child?

106
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,300
That kid could be his.

107
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,300
It is a complicated situation.

108
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,400
It seems pretty simple to me.

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're an unfeeling bitch.

110
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,300
Why'd  you hit the lawn boy?

111
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,400
Oh.

112
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,100
Well, if you saw what he did to our begonias,
you'd slap him, too.

113
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,200
I can't tell from -- from this.
I can't tell anything.

114
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,100
Hey.

115
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,600
Hey, Lynette. What -- what are you doing here? 
What's this?

116
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
You told me Duggan's coming back to work today.

117
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,700
I thought I'd do something special for him.

118
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,400
Uh-huh, and this wouldn't have anything to do
with you checking up on me and Annabel.

119
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,300
What?

120
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,700
Yesterday, you brought by pictures of the kids.

121
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,400
The day before that, you brought me soup.

122
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,800
Lynette, honey... it's got to stop.

123
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,200
Tom...

124
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,700
I don't care about you working with Annabel.
I told you that.

125
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,400
This is for Duggan.
He had a heart attack.

126
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,100
I don't care about Annabel.

127
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,800
Hey, Lynette.

128
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Huh. Speak of the devil.

129
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,400
And I mean that.

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Well, you're becoming a regular
fixture around here, aren't ya?

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,200
Oh, yeah, I wanted to do
something nice for Duggan.

132
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,300
I suppose filling his bloodstream
with butterfat might be considered nice.

133
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,100
Actually, it's fruit juice-sweetened.

134
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,100
Can I cut you?

135
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,200
A piece.

136
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,500
Everyone, I need to see you right now.

137
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,400
Okay, listen up.

138
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
I just spoke with Tim Duggan's wife,

139
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,800
and it looks like he's not going
to be returning to work after all.

140
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,000
It seems that he had a relapse last night,

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,700
which, unfortunately, puts us in a very tight spot,

142
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,100
but we're going to work together
as a team and do what we need to do.

143
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,500
So, Jerry, you're taking
the hollister account.

144
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Suzanne, you're covering faraday springs,

145
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,200
and, Annabel, I want you to take the lead
on the travelers hotel chain.

146
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,500
You're leaving for Hawaii in three days.

147
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,800
I can't handle travelers by myself,
especially not if they're moving into print.

148
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,000
Well, choose someone to take with you.

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,800
Oh, okay.
Um...

150
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,000
I choose...
Tom.

151
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,800
Well, let's see --
I've beaten you at bridge and mah-jongg and hearts.

152
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,800
This is your last chance to redeem yourself.

153
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,000
Stop it.
You're going to make me laugh.

154
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Okay.
Okay, I'll be good.

155
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,800
Miss it.
Miss it. Miss it.

156
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,100
- Bree.
- Ha ha. Come on.

157
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,800
I don't have to psych you out.

158
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay, time's up. Take your best shot.

159
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm not ready yet.

160
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,700
Hurry up. There are people waiting.

161
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,300
One more minute.

162
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Come on. Take your best --

163
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,500
Don't do that.

164
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:19,000
George... do you have an erection?

165
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,900
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,400
- What on earth... 
- you were blowing on my ear.

167
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,800
- I was teasing you. 
- Exactly.

168
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,000
You have got to get rid of it.
There are children present.

169
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,000
How?

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,500
I don't know. Um, um...
think of something unpleasant.

171
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,400
Like what?

172
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,700
Like famine or disease or hobos.

173
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,500
Whatever. Just hurry.

174
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,300
Look, you can't be mad about it.

175
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,000
It's not something men can control.

176
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,600
I kept this friendship going because I thought 
Rex's dislike of you was paranoid,

177
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,200
but you had feelings for me all along.

178
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,300
God, this is just such a betrayal.

179
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,400
Come on, Bree.

180
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,500
The only thing I am guilty of 
is loving you in silence.

181
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,900
Well, you shouldn't be doing that.

182
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,700
In case you've forgotten, I'm married.

183
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,800
To a selfish 2-faced liar 
who betrayed you with a hooker.

184
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
I told you that in confidence.

185
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,900
How dare you throw it back in my face?

186
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:18,500
So you're ending our friendship
after everything I've done for you?

187
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,000
What is that supposed to mean?

188
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,100
Nothing. It didn't --

189
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,200
it didn't mean anything.

190
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,500
Oh, George.
I do love you -- as a friend.

191
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,400
I wish you could love me the same way back,
but since you can't...

192
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,300
goodbye.

193
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,100
<font color=yellow>Later that day,
Edie Britt witnessed something disturbing.

194
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,400
<font color=yellow>Something she was determined to put a stop to.

195
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,700
So is Susan coming?

196
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,100
She said she might be a little late.

197
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,400
They've already started moving
a few of Mike's things over to her house.

198
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,300
Already? Wow. Good for her.

199
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah, it's nice to see Susan so happy again.

200
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,900
Yeah,  I'm happy for Susan.

201
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,300
But don't you think she and Mike 
are moving a little fast?

202
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,400
I mean, two days ago, she was thinking 
he was a murderer,

203
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,800
and now she's moving in with him?

204
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,700
Mm, she found out it was in self-defense.

205
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,300
I think they've cleared everything up.

206
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,700
Yeah, good point.
Mike's a decent guy.

207
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,700
Yeah, that's true.

208
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,000
Of course, there was the gunshot wound.

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,400
That's right. Did he ever explain that?

210
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,500
No, and I know guns,
and that wound was not self-inflicted.

211
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,600
Mm. Mm.

212
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,100
And then what about Mrs. Huber's 
bloodstained jewelry?

213
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,700
Yeah, that didn't walk into 
Mike's garage by itself.

214
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,000
Maybe this is a mistake.

215
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,900
You know, if there's one thing I've learned --
men can't be trusted.

216
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,300
Hold it.

217
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,600
Are you saying that we should 
put a stop to this?

218
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,600
Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt to sit her down
and share our concerns.

219
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,700
Yeah, we could do that.

220
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,200
Yeah.

221
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,100
Edie, do you want to be a part of it?

222
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,900
Well, normally I prefer not to get involved.

223
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:19,300
But... if there's any way that I could help Susan...

224
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
- uh, we need to talk.
- Okay.

225
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Uh, when I was packing up your stuff 
in your bedroom, I found a box of bullets.

226
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,800
Oh.

227
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,400
Look, I feel really bad about Dierdre,

228
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,600
and I know that you must want 
to find out who killed her,

229
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,500
but if we're going to move in together,
we can't have this stuff hanging over us.

230
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,600
You've got to get rid of it -- all of it.

231
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,700
The file, the map, the gun.

232
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,900
Especially the gun -- and leave this to the police.

233
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,500
They're the professionals.

234
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,300
What can I say? Um...

235
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,000
it seems like a reasonable request.

236
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,600
Oh.
Ha ha.

237
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,900
Really? Well, that was easy.

238
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,000
Uh, maybe after lunch,
we could talk about your leather beanbag chair.

239
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,600
<font color=lightgreen>"I realize now that I've treated you badly."

240
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,200
<font color=lightgreen>"I'm the one who needs to get help, not you."

241
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,400
<font color=lightgreen>"So I have to go away for a while."

242
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,800
<font color=lightgreen>"In the meantime, Mrs. Tilman will look out for you."

243
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,400
I don't consider it a burden.

244
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,000
You know you're welcome here.

245
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,600
<font color=lightgreen>"I've left you some things."
"I hope you can take comfort in them."

246
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,300
<font color=lightgreen>"I got you a new mitt.
Work on your curve ball while I'm gone."

247
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,200
<font color=lightgreen>"I love you. Dad."

248
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,800
I-I don't understand.

249
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,200
Why wouldn't he come see me?

250
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,300
Why just run away?

251
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,000
Your father's been very troubled, dear.

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,200
I'm sure he did what he felt was best for you.

253
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,900
And he wants me to take comfort in this junk?

254
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,200
I hate baseball!
You'd think he would know that!

255
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,100
Zach.

256
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:52,600
<font color=lightgreen>Zach, I didn't leave you, meet me at the baseball field,
Thursday at midnight. Dad.

257
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,500
Susan's coming.

258
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,600
Okay.

259
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,100
Okay, guys, um, interventions are never pretty,

260
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,100
so stay strong, 'cause 
she's probably going to cry.

261
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
Bon jour.

262
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,100
Oh, hi.

263
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,300
I-I didn't know that the cooking lesson
was going to be a group activity.

264
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,700
Well, the more the merrier, right?

265
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,600
As long as nobody makes 
fun of my lousy crepes.

266
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,200
Ha ha ha ha.

267
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,100
How come I'm the only one wearing an apron?

268
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,300
I know it seems like we're ganging up on you,

269
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:50,400
but you were moving so fast, we thought a sort of...
intervention was necessary.

270
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,800
I know it's tough to hear.

271
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,800
None of us wanted to do this.

272
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,400
I appreciate what you guys are trying to do,
I really do.

273
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,600
Um... I'm not going to change my mind.

274
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,000
In my life, I have been hurt a lot.

275
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Karl and, uh...

276
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,400
well, it's just taught me to be cynical

277
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,500
and expect the absolute worst from people.

278
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,100
And I don't want to live like that anymore,

279
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,500
and when Mike asked me to move in with him...

280
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,800
I was just happy.
You know, just ridiculously happy.

281
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,700
I mean, I still am,

282
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
and I want to go with that feeling.

283
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,400
I love him, and -- I love him.

284
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,800
So I'm going to expect the best from Mike,

285
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,200
and I know that he is going to 
deliver that in return.

286
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,900
- Okay?
- Honey...

287
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,100
- Okay.
- That was so beautiful. Okay.

288
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,500
This is the worst intervention 
I've ever been to.

289
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,200
This is fun.

290
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,900
It's forever since we had lunch.

291
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,500
Well, as happy as I am to see you,

292
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
I actually have an agenda.

293
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,400
I ran into someone last week
who said you guys are looking to hire.

294
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,200
Is that true?

295
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,900
Yeah.

296
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,400
Are you thinking of coming back?

297
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,900
Because say the word, and I --

298
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,500
No, no, not me.

299
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,100
I was actually thinking more about Tom.

300
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,300
Oh.  Tom.

301
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,300
Yeah, he's been thinking about 
making a move for a while.

302
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,600
He kind of feels like he's done everything
he can where he is now.

303
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,500
Ah.

304
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,100
Well, Tom's certainly solid.

305
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,500
He's more than solid.

306
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,800
Tom's ideas are spectacular,
he's passionate about his work,

307
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,800
his visual instincts are off the chart.

308
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,400
Is he as good as you?

309
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,800
He's apples. I'm oranges.

310
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,300
We excel in different areas.

311
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,800
Trust me -- you should give Tom a look.

312
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,900
I don't need apples.

313
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,500
I need someone like you.

314
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,000
Cutthroat.
Ruthless.

315
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,300
Oh, jeez, Nat,
you make me sound like some kind of shark.

316
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,800
Ah. Okay.

317
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,500
You know, actually...
if that's the kind of exec you're looking for...

318
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,900
You've got a shark for me?

319
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,500
Yes.
A very pretty shark.

320
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,400
So here's what I'm thinking.

321
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,700
I'm going to see if Dr. Morrison
at the lipstone clinic can come in and consult.

322
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
You want to bring someone else in?

323
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Your body isn't responding to
the medication the way it should.

324
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,200
And the tests we've run have 
all come back negative,

325
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,200
so I -- I just want to be on the safe side.

326
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,300
Would you excuse me?
I need to take this.

327
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,300
I don't know why, but 
I have this overwhelming feeling

328
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,900
that you're going to be just fine. I really do.

329
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,500
Lee Craig has the biggest ego 
of any doctor I know.

330
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,400
If he wants to consult with someone,
that mean she's stumped...

331
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,500
which means I'm screwed.

332
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,300
- Don't say that.
- Damn it, Bree,

333
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,900
do you understand what's going on here?

334
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,500
I could die.

335
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,700
So could I.

336
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,400
What?

337
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,100
I could walk across the street tomorrow 
and be hit by a car.

338
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,000
What in god's name is your point?

339
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,100
All I'm saying is that we're both 
going to die eventually,

340
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,400
and in the time that we have left,
whether it's two days or two decades,

341
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,000
I think that we should be nice to each other.

342
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,900
You're right.

343
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,600
Um, Ms. Tilman,

344
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,800
Paul young's been missing 
the last couple of days.

345
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Have you seen him?

346
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,200
Why ask me?

347
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,800
Well, I saw him leave a box on your doorstep,

348
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,200
and I've also seen Zach over here.

349
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,500
If I did know where Mr. Young was,
why would I tell you?

350
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,200
Look, um... the police think I killed your sister,
and I'm sure you do, too,

351
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
but I swear to you, I had nothing to do with it.

352
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,200
And you think Paul Young did.

353
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,100
Well... no, uh, that's not what I was saying.

354
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,100
You got to admit, it's a neat theory.

355
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,600
Care for a snack?

356
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
And so it's not such a stretch to wonder

357
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,200
if Paul avenged his wife's death
by killing Martha for blackmailing them.

358
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,700
But perhaps I'm alone in that.

359
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,400
You're not.

360
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,300
Aren't you sweet.

361
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,000
Tea?

362
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,300
Thanks.

363
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,300
Do these journals say anything about
why your sister was blackmailing the Youngs?

364
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,900
Not specifically.

365
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,200
But I got the definite impression
that it involved a murder, and...

366
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,000
now here you are saying your friend was murdered.

367
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,300
Any reason you haven't shown these to the police?

368
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,100
Are you in favor of the death penalty?

369
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,700
Um... yeah.

370
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,500
So am I.

371
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,700
We had it in Utah.

372
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,500
Not in this state, though.

373
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,700
A shame.

374
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,600
Don't you agree?

375
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
Yeah, I do.

376
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,200
I like you so much, Mr. Delfino.

377
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,400
Do you know where Paul Young is?

378
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,600
I'm afraid not.

379
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,300
But I know where he'll be on Thursday night.

380
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,800
<font color=yellow>That afternoon while retrieving her mail,

381
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:51,800
<font color=yellow>Gabrielle was surprised to finally learn
the truth behind her pregnancy.

382
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,300
<font color=yellow>Very surprised.

383
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,200
Hey, babe, you want to go online 
and check out strollers?

384
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,000
What's going on?

385
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,400
I just want to say goodbye,
because I'm leaving you.

386
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,800
What?

387
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,100
See, our health insurance sent us a letter

388
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,100
because someone ordered a year's
worth of my birth control pills.

389
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,900
And apparently, our policy doesn't cover
drugs bought by the kilo.

390
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,800
I told you it was mama.

391
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,500
The prescription was dated, Carlos,

392
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,400
and Juanita was in a coma 
when this claim was filed.

393
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
You did this, not your mother.

394
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,700
At least be man enough to own up to it.
She would have been.

395
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,700
- Gabrielle, stop.
- Unh, unh, unh, pregnant, caveman.

396
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,600
Remember?

397
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,700
- Where are you going?
- Away.

398
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,300
I'm going to jail.

399
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,700
I'll be gone tomorrow.

400
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,900
I know. That's why I only packed one bag.

401
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,900
What about the baby, Gabrielle, huh?

402
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,800
What about my baby?

403
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,100
Oh, your baby?

404
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,800
Fine -- our baby.

405
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,700
Hey, we're a family now.

406
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,400
This baby needs its mother and its father.

407
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,300
Oh, Carlos.

408
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,700
Whoever said you were the father?

409
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
Hey.

410
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,900
Hey.

411
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,700
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?

412
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,600
Damn felon!

413
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,700
<font color=lightgreen>All units, code d-1630,
suspect is a violation of house arrest.

414
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,800
<font color=lightgreen>Currently heading Weston Parker Boulevard.

415
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,100
Uh, this is unit 14. 
We're on our way.

416
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,800
Looks like the fed shave a runner.

417
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,300
Let's go.

418
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,200
Is John here?

419
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,300
If I say no, are you going to slap me again?

420
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,400
He's working. Why?

421
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,400
I just left my husband.

422
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,700
Hang on.

423
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,500
You think just because you mow my lawn
you can bang my wife?

424
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,100
Stop!

425
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,600
Hey, hey, hey!
Get up!

426
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,700
Hey.
What's going on?

427
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,700
Oh, Tom, I have had the craziest day.

428
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,400
This morning, the guys from 
Mitchell and Kerns call me in.

429
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,500
They offer me a job.

430
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,300
A-are you going to take it?

431
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,300
Well, I told Peterson about it.
He just upped their offer.

432
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,900
He just made me vice-president.

433
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,700
Of what?

434
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,300
Tom -- the firm.

435
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,200
He gave me Duggan's old job. 
Isn't that wild?

436
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,600
I got to go tell Scotty. 
I'll see you later.

437
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,600
Oh, Tom, I was just coming to find you.

438
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,400
What the hell, Dan?

439
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,900
I mean, wh-what the hell?

440
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,900
Y-you promoted Annabel over me?

441
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,200
She got another job offer.
I couldn't afford to lose her, not now.

442
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,600
Well, guess what -- you lose me.

443
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,700
'Cause I quit.

444
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,800
Tom, don't overreact.

445
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,900
No, the first time you passed me by,

446
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,400
I took it like a good soldier,

447
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,700
but since Duggan's heart attack,
I have already been doing the job.

448
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,500
I have been doing it, and then 
you just hand it to Annabel?

449
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,100
Okay. You made your point.

450
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,100
No, you make crappy decision son a daily basis, Dan,

451
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,400
I got to tell you, but this one --
this is the stupidest.

452
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,100
Hey, watch yourself.

453
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,000
You have been running this company
into the ground since you got here.

454
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,800
Way I see it, I'm getting out easy.

455
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,500
All right, Scavo, you want to know
why I gave that promotion to Annabel?

456
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,200
Why she got the nod instead of you?

457
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,500
It was Lynette.

458
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,300
What?

459
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,000
She went to my wife and begged her
to get me to kill your promotion.

460
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,800
She said that if you start traveling more,
it's going to hurt your family.

461
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,800
She did that.

462
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,600
Now I feel like a chump for 
trying to help you guys out.

463
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,600
I guess it was another one of my crappy decisions.

464
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,400
Have your desk cleaned out by tonight.

465
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,900
You ready to tell us what you got against this kid?

466
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,200
It's between him and me -- and my wife.

467
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,600
Is that what this is about -- you doing his wife?

468
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,300
No.
I'm gay.

469
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
You're gay?

470
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,100
- What?!
- I'm gay.

471
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,100
Oh, this is not happening again.

472
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,600
What do you mean, "again"?

473
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,100
I want a lawyer.

474
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,900
George.

475
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,900
Hi. What are you doing here?

476
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,500
I'm shopping, obviously.

477
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,100
Why are you shopping here?
You live on the other side of town.

478
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,200
My friend had an operation, 
and I'm buying her some things.

479
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,100
Oh. Well, that's very nice of you.

480
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,600
Wait, Bree.

481
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,400
I have to tell you something.

482
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,800
Well?

483
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:05,000
You need to tell Rex to be more discreet
when it comes to discussing your love life.

484
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,500
I'm sorry?

485
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,700
I don't want to say anything more.

486
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,400
You just really need to tell him that.

487
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,700
Wait. Wait a minute.

488
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,800
What in the world are you talking about?

489
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,500
I was at the hospital visiting my friend
who had had this operation,

490
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:29,100
and I overheard two doctors
talking about Rex's fondness for... S&M?

491
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,800
You heard that?

492
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,800
Apparently, he told them he has A...
box of toys,

493
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:49,100
and he gets you to do...
very inappropriate things.

494
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,000
I see.

495
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,400
Bree, this is clearly none of my business,
and I would have never brought this up,

496
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,000
but to hear those two men laughing about you...

497
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,100
I just thought you should know.

498
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,900
Oh, thank you for telling me,
but I think, um, I got to go.

499
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,100
Hey, I got some more boxes.

500
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,000
That's your answer to everything these days.

501
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,300
So what do you think we should do for dinner?

502
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,700
Oh, I, uh, I can't.

503
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,800
I just got an emergency phone call --
busted water main.

504
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Okay.
I'll keep it warm for you.

505
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,900
I'm, uh, afraid I'm going to be too late for dinner.

506
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,500
I wasn't talking about dinner.

507
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,900
Need some help?

508
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:14,000
Uh, no. No, I got it.
Um... I got it.

509
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,500
So if you have a plumbing emergency,
shouldn't you get going?

510
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,800
Um, they've already got somebody on it.

511
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm just part of the relief crew.

512
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,600
Oh. Well, I'll just get back to work.

513
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,900
Mom, stalking?

514
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,200
Are we really doing this?

515
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,500
You just made such a huge deal to your friends
about how much you trust him now.

516
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,500
Well, that was before I found 
Mrs. Huber's journal in his truck.

517
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,600
So what's in it?

518
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,600
It's not about what's in it.

519
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,300
It's about the fact that he had it at all.

520
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,400
I would bet you anything he is not 
going on a plumbing job,

521
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,400
and we're going to find out.

522
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:02,800
Mom... if you don't trust him, 
why are you moving in with him?

523
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,200
I don't have time to explain adult relationships to you.

524
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,800
Oh, duck down.

525
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,800
I think you lost him.

526
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,100
He's six cars up.

527
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,400
We have to stay this far back or he'll see us.

528
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Okay, great, but we can't see him, either.

529
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,000
I got to tell you, mom, you're not great at this.

530
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,500
Oh, yeah? When your father was cheating on me,

531
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,100
I used to follow him all the time.
I know my stuff.

532
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,900
There he is.

533
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,400
What's Mike doing?

534
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,700
Who's that he's pulling up to?

535
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,500
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.

536
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,000
Wait here.

537
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,100
And lock the doors.

538
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,200
All right, what the hell are you up to? 
Oh, my god.

539
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,800
Wow, um...
okay. Oh, wow.

540
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,000
Uh...
bye.

541
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,100
Was that your wife?

542
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,900
If that was my wife,
do you think I'd be here with you?

543
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,200
It wasn't Mike, was it?

544
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,600
No.
No, it wasn't.

545
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,900
They're charging you with a hate crime?

546
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,100
You remember when our cable guy was beaten up?

547
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,600
That was me.

548
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,400
I thought you were cheating with him.

549
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
With our gay cable guy?

550
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
I didn't know he was gay.

551
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,400
And I didn't know Justin was, either.

552
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,100
Now the cops think I'm some kind of 
serial gay-basher.

553
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,400
Well, you sort of are.

554
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,500
Well, you provoked me.

555
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,800
You were pretending to have an affair
just to punish me.

556
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,000
Well... obviously.

557
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So now I need you to lie again.

558
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,600
I need you to tell the cops
you were having an affair,

559
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,400
and that I just beat up the wrong guy.

560
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,500
Guys.

561
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,500
I am not lying for you, Carlos.

562
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:35,500
Gabby, if this charge sticks,
I get sent away for eight years.

563
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,200
Am I supposed to be impressed?

564
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,900
Because of your little stunt 
with my birth control pills,

565
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,800
I've lost my freedom for the next 18 years.

566
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,300
Gabby... please don't do this.

567
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,300
Gabby.
Don't walk away.

568
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,300
Gabby!

569
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,500
Okay, next time, I won't bring 
my daughter to stalk my boyfriend.

570
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,800
It was a slight error in judgment.

571
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,800
Honey, please don't give me the silent treatment.

572
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,300
I'm not.

573
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,000
Did you say you read this?

574
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,800
Yeah, part of it. Why?

575
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,500
Mrs. Huber was blackmailing Zach's mom.

576
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,000
Zach?

577
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,700
What are you doing up?

578
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,500
I couldn't sleep, so I was just...

579
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,200
sitting here thinking.

580
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,800
About what?

581
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,300
You really want to know?

582
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,300
Bree... I'm not feeling too hot 
right now, so just tell me.

583
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,900
What's up?

584
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:44,200
I was thinking that the biggest mistake
of my entire life was agreeing to marry you.

585
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,100
Let me guess.
I've done something wrong.

586
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,200
Forcing me to share in your depraved 
pastime wasn't bad enough,

587
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,200
you had to share my humiliation 
with your coworkers?

588
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,700
What?

589
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,300
Rex, everybody is talking about our sex life.

590
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:10,200
Every sordid little detail, right down to
that box of perversions you keep in the closet.

591
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,200
Bree, I-I never said anything to anyone, 
I swear to god.

592
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,400
- You're a liar. 
- Who told you this?

593
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,000
Doesn't matter.

594
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,100
It does matter, because I never said anything.

595
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,100
Well, then, how do people know?

596
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,100
Because we both know that I wouldn't say anything.

597
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,700
Well, why would I tell people 
about what we do in bed?

598
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,700
I don't know, Rex.
Maybe you were bragging.

599
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,700
Or maybe you just subconsciously 
wanted to hurt me.

600
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,100
Well, congratulations. You did it.

601
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,200
I am officially destroyed.

602
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,400
- I didn't say anything. 
- I don't believe you.

603
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,600
Oh.

604
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,000
Ohh.

605
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,100
Rex?

606
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,900
What? What is it?

607
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,200
I think I'm having a heart attack.

608
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,300
No, you're not.

609
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:02,000
Bree, you're going to have to take me to the hospital.

610
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,000
Um... all right.

611
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,800
You, uh, go downstairs, and, um...

612
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,800
I will be -- I'll be right there.

613
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,700
Daddy?

614
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
What are you doing?

615
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,600
I'm waiting for your mother
to take me to the emergency room.

616
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,700
What's wrong?

617
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,900
I'm having a heart attack.

618
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,100
Oh, my god. Where is she?

619
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,900
That's a good question.

620
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,000
Daddy says he's having a heart attack.

621
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,200
I know. I'm going to take him to the hospital.

622
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,100
Well, when?

623
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,100
When I finish making the bed.

624
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,300
What?

625
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,000
I never leave the house with an unmade bed.
You know that.

626
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,900
But daddy needs to go to the hospital.

627
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,200
There. Now we can go.

628
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,800
<font color=yellow>Nothing is forever,

629
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,200
<font color=yellow>and the time comes when we all must say
goodbye to the world we knew.

630
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:46,400
<font color=yellow>Goodbye to everything we had taken for granted.

631
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:55,700
<font color=yellow>Goodbye to those we thought would never abandon us.

632
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:05,100
<font color=yellow>And when these changes finally do occur...

633
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,200
<font color=yellow>when the familiar has departed

634
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,000
<font color=yellow>and the unfamiliar has taken its place...

635
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:19,700
<font color=yellow>all any of us can really do
is to say hello...

636
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,500
<font color=yellow>and welcome.
