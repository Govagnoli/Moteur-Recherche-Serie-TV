1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,300
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,100
Is anybody here?

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,500
There may have been a breakdown
in our chain of care.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,600
You're trying to buy us off?

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,300
Sometimes if you're not careful...

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,700
There's this place called Camp Hennessey.

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,600
I'm not going to any stupid camp
for juvenile delinquents.

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,000
You don't have a choice.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,300
Past mistakes...

10
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,000
We pulled it out of rock water lake.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,600
I must have sold several hundred of these just like it.

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,000
I have a list of customers' names on file.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Will come back to haunt you.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,300
I won't tell anyone.

15
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,600
I'll keep your secret, dad.

16
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:37,700
There were many things Gabrielle solis
knew for certain.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,800
She knew red was her color.

18
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,000
She knew diamonds went with everything.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,700
And she knew men were all the same.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,300
But the one thing Gabrielle knew above all else...

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,500
she would never want children.

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,100
Unfortunately for Gabrielle...

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:14,400
her husband Carlos felt differently.

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,700
I'm so lucky to have you.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,800
Okay, I'll bite.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,100
Why are you so lucky?

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,400
Because...

28
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,400
I don't want to have kids, and you do.

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,700
Oh, that.

30
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,600
Most men would leave over something like that.

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,600
And you're still here.

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,300
I'm grateful.

33
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,600
I know the sacrifice you're making.

34
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,400
There's still a little part of me that's hoping
you'll change your mind.

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,300
Once you had a baby,

36
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,300
I think that you would love it so much that --

37
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,700
Honey, it's not going to happen.

38
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,200
You never know.

39
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,800
No, sometimes you do.

40
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,300
Well, it is a sacrifice.

41
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,100
But you're worth it.

42
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Yes, Gabrielle Solis knew without a doubt
she didn't want to be a mother.

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,700
But what she couldn't know was just how much
her husband wanted to be a father...

44
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:38,400
or that he'd been tampering
with her birth control for months...

45
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,900
or that within one week's time...

46
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,400
she'd be pregnant.

47
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,000
Episode 18 : Children Will Listen

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,600
Saturdays on Wisteria Lane
belonged to the children,

49
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,300
and while most would spend the day
practicing their sports...

50
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,800
Oh-ho!

51
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,300
And riding their bikes...

52
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,600
and jumping their ropes,

53
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,700
others were no longer engaged in child's play.

54
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,300
Indeed, some children were being
forced to grow up very quickly.

55
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,200
Sorry to bother you on the weekend.
We just have a few questions for you.

56
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,600
About what?

57
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,000
12 years ago, your late wife purchased a toy chest.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,600
Toy chest?

59
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,900
Yeah, it was about this big,
had little dancing bears on it.

60
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,500
Gosh, I'm sorry.

61
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,100
The craftsman who makes these chests
keeps a list of customers.

62
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,600
Apparently, you purchased one in august 1992.

63
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,300
Yeah, we'd like to know
where that chest is now.

64
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,000
Wow, I, um,
I wish I could help you.

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't recall any toy chest.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,200
I remember.

67
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,900
Yeah, it had little bears
and balloons on it, right?

68
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,900
Yeah, son, that's right.

69
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,700
Yeah, we threw that chest away
when I was little.

70
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,400
I was standing on it, and it just busted.

71
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,800
Remember, dad?

72
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Vaguely.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,300
I guess that's all, then.

74
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,400
Thank you both for your time.

75
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,600
Hey, what's the deal with
this chest, anyway?

76
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
One just like you had washed up on torch lake.

77
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,500
Had a woman in it.

78
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,200
A woman?

79
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,200
She was all chopped up.

80
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,500
Obviously, we need to talk.

81
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,000
You lied to me.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,500
You said that it was a man in the box.

83
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,800
No, I didn't lie.

84
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,000
Well, the policeman said that
it was a woman's body.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,100
Of course you were lying.

86
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,700
I told you a private detective had come
to take you away from us.

87
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,100
I never said it was a man.

88
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,700
You didn't?

89
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,000
No.

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,800
Well, I- I thought that --

91
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,600
no.

92
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,000
No, stop. Please -- stop.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,900
I- I -- look, I know that you're lying to me, okay?

94
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,000
I- I know that you're lying.

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,400
For the last time, someone came
and tried to take you away from us.

96
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes, a woman. A woman came.

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yes, she tried to steal you from the only family
that you've ever really known.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,200
And we couldn't let that happen, and we didn't.

99
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,600
And that... is the truth.

100
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,300
We  can't cancel now.
It's two days away.

101
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,800
Rex, I'm not going.
That's all there is to it.

102
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Counseling is part of the treatment
at Camp Hennessey. You knew that.

103
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Nowhere in that brochure did it say
that we were expected to attend.

104
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,200
What's Andrew going to think
if you don't show up?

105
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, I am making him this care package.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,700
I mean, he'll know that I'm thinking about him.

107
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,500
Why are you putting in lemon squares?

108
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,200
They told us not to send him sweets.

109
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,900
Well, I don't understand why.

110
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,700
I  guess they feel baked goods from mom
undercut the boot camp experience.

111
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,300
Fine. I won't send them,
but I think it's a stupid rule.

112
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,800
So are you going to this thing or not?

113
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,500
- No.
- Why?

114
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,800
Because the minute I get there,
Andrew will start attacking me for abandoning him.

115
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,900
And I don't want to hear it.

116
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,300
There's no reason to feel guilty, you know.

117
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,600
You did everything you could for him.

118
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,400
I don't feel guilty.

119
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,500
Okay.

120
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:28,600
Please, Christie, there's no way that I can get
another babysitter this late in the day --

121
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,200
Parker, knock it off.

122
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,000
No.

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,300
Because I'm having drinks with friends
I used to work with, and they never called,

124
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,000
and if I blow them off, that's it,
I'll just -- I'm dead to them.

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,400
No, I can't call Patty Binks.

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,500
Because she steals things.

127
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Damn it, Christie, you're 13 years old.

128
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,700
You've got a lot of trips to the mall ahead of you.

129
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,600
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

130
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm sorry I raised my voice. I'm calm.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,500
So I'm starting to think that this is about money.

132
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,600
So what is it that would make
it worth your while?

133
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,500
$100? Well, that's extortion.

134
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,100
There's no way in hell that I'm going to -- hello?

135
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,300
Hello?

136
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,600
Parker, I swear, I will spank you.

137
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,300
Knock it off.

138
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,300
Hi, Mrs. Binks. Is Patty there?

139
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,100
Thank you.

140
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,900
Hi, honey. I'm back.

141
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,700
Hey, sweetie.

142
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,700
This is Mr. Steinberg, the attorney from the hospital.

143
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,300
Oh, have we met?

144
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes, Mrs. Solis. We've met.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,500
Don't you remember?

146
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,800
It was after mama died.

147
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,100
Apparently,the hospital was negligent
and agreed to a 7-figure settlement check,

148
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,100
a check I was never told about.

149
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,900
Oh, that.

150
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,100
Mr. Steinberg...

151
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,900
I was just leaving.

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,200
What were you thinking?!

153
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Wait, just let me explain --

154
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,000
no, why the hell didn't you tell me?!

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,300
Because I couldn't trust you
to make the right decision.

156
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,000
The right decision was to use
that money for my lawyers!

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We could have fought the indictment, and then
I wouldn't have had to take the plea bargain!

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,900
If you didn't take the plea deal, the government
would have seized the settlement.

159
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,600
Oh, we could have fought that in court.

160
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,200
Exactly,and then you would have blown
all the money on the lawyers.

161
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,300
Who cares?!

162
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,700
If there was a chance didn't have to go to jail.

163
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,300
You had Laotian convicts sewing casual wear
for 2 cents an hour.

164
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,700
Don't you think you deserve a time-out?

165
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,100
Eight months.

166
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,000
Thanks to you, I'm going away for eight months.

167
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And when you get out, we're going to have money
to start over with thanks to me.

168
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,400
You know, once you calm down, you're going to
realize I did the right thing,

169
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,800
and when that happens,
I'd appreciate an apology.

170
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,900
Grandma's here.

171
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,300
Now, that is just perfect.

172
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Stay put.

173
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,000
I am so sorry.

174
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,200
Hey, mom.

175
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,900
Oh, hey, Susie.
Mm, I goofed.

176
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,700
What happened?

177
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,000
Oh, you know me.
No depth perception whatsoever.

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm stunned they even issued me a license.

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,500
So you're Susan's mom.

180
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,600
Yeah.

181
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,900
I'm Sophie Bremer. And you are...

182
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,600
Mike Delfino.

183
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,200
Oh.

184
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,500
You're Mike?

185
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,100
Oh, my god!

186
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Susan's told me so much about you.

187
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,600
Well, don't just stand there. Give me a hug.

188
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,300
Mom, uh...
Mike and I aren't together anymore.

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,300
Oh. I'm sorry.

190
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,100
I-I guess I just made this pretty awkward, huh?

191
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,400
Yeah, you --you really did.

192
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,000
So let's just call the insurance company.

193
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,300
Okay.

194
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,800
Well... it's nice meeting you anyway, Mike.

195
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,600
Yeah. You too.

196
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,400
And I never would have guessed
that you're Susan's mom.

197
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,000
I know. I look too young.

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,700
I got pregnant when I was a tiny teenager.

199
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,400
Okay.

200
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,700
It  was the first time I got drunk -- ever.

201
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,800
Can you believe it?

202
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,600
Let's go.

203
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,100
Her father was a marine.

204
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,500
Afterwards, he gave me three of his medals.

205
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,800
- Mom.
- What?

206
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,900
Let's just go inside and
call the insurance company.

207
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,900
Oh, right.

208
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,100
What are you smiling about?

209
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,100
I used to have all these questions about
how you got to be the way you are.

210
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,100
They were all just answered.

211
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,500
Hi!

212
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,100
Hi.

213
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,500
Hi.

214
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,000
What's going on?

215
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,300
Oh, um... my babysitter canceled.

216
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,900
Oh, Lynette, I-I'm so swamped today.

217
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,600
My -- my house is a mess, and I've got
millions of errands to run, so --

218
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,300
Please hear me out.
This is important.

219
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,100
Today I have a chance to rejoin the human race
for a few hours.

220
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,400
There are actual adults waiting
for me with margaritas.

221
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,600
Look, I'm in a dress.
I have makeup on.

222
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
If it were any other day --

223
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,200
Oh, for god's sakes, Bree,
I'm wearing pantyhose.

224
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,800
Bring them in.

225
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,700
Thank you, thank you.
Okay, in you go.

226
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,700
And then the police showed me his mug shot.

227
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,500
No.

228
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,700
Yes. Mike served time for selling
drugs and manslaughter.

229
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,700
I can't believe it.

230
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,300
Well, it's true.

231
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,000
He has such nice manners, you know?

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,400
I know.

233
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,700
Susie...

234
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,900
I don't want you worrying too much
about this Mike thing.

235
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,800
The right man will come along.

236
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,700
Just give it time.

237
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,100
I think I would have given up entirely
if it weren't for you and Morty.

238
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,900
Morty?

239
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,300
Yeah, you know.

240
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,400
It's the third time around for both of you,
and you're really clicking.

241
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,700
Ugh. Gives me hope.

242
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,900
What's wrong?

243
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,600
Nothing, nothing.

244
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,200
Um, I'm just...
I'm, uh, tired.

245
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,200
You're not tired. You took a nap.
What is it?

246
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,800
I left Morty.

247
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
What?

248
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,500
Why?

249
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Because he shoved me.

250
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
Morty? No.

251
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,700
You think I'm lying?

252
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,500
Fine.

253
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,900
Why would he shove you?

254
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,800
Because I confronted him

255
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,600
about how much time he's spending
at that damn pancake restaurant --

256
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,300
if that's where he's really been.

257
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,600
Oh, you can't be serious. Morty?

258
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,900
You think men his age don't have needs?

259
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,200
You should seethe waitresses he hires.

260
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,000
Every year, they get younger and younger.

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,800
Well, maybe you just feel that way 'cause every year
you get older and older.

262
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,600
Well, that's a horrible thing to say.

263
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,400
I'm sorry.

264
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
I'm not that old.

265
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,200
I said I was sorry.

266
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,500
People think we're sisters.

267
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Well, that's 'cause you tell them that.

268
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
One time.

269
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,000
You've got to let go of that.

270
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Okay, look, I am just saying that I don't think
Morty cheated on you.

271
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,100
Well, he did shove me.

272
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,700
And the least you can do is be supportive.

273
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,800
You're right.
You're right.

274
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,500
He also threw a book at me.

275
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,800
Oh, come on.

276
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,300
Hey -- ah.

277
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,900
I mean...
he shouldn't have done that.

278
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,000
Ha. Thank you.

279
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,700
Porter, honey,those cookies are hot.

280
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,000
Just wait a few minutes, and then I'll give you one
when they're cool, okay?

281
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,400
Um... you know, pictures are prettier
if you color inside the lines.

282
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,600
Well, art is subjective.

283
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,700
Porter, what did I tell you?

284
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,800
But I'm hungry.

285
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:03,100
Well, then, I will fix you a very nice bowl
of peaches and cottage cheese.

286
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,100
Ew, barf.

287
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,800
Don't be common, young man. Now come on.

288
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,300
If you play around with those cookies one more time,
I'm going to have to spank you.

289
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,600
We don't get spanked.

290
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,300
Really?

291
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,600
Mommy always says she's going to,
but she never does.

292
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:23,200
Well, I am not your mommy, and if you misbehave
in my house, you will get spanked.

293
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,300
So be good.

294
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,100
How's my girl?

295
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,200
How are you doing?

296
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,000
It was an accident.

297
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,600
Porter, I warned you.

298
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm sorry.I'll be good.

299
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,700
Those cookies were made from scratch.

300
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,700
Your  fate is sealed.

301
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,300
Come here.

302
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,800
No, no!

303
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Ow!

304
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,900
Ow!

305
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,000
Ow!

306
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,100
Ow!

307
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
What's that?

308
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,000
It's called a post-nuptial agreement.

309
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,300
It's a legal document that --

310
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,000
No, I know what a post-nup is.

311
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,400
What is it doing on my coffee table?

312
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,200
Well, I can forgive that stunt you pulled
with the settlement check

313
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,800
if I'm sure that you'll really be around
when I get out of jail.

314
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,400
Hmm.

315
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,000
And the post-nup changes
the terms of the pre-nup, so...

316
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So if you try and divorce me while I'm gone,

317
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,200
you get nothing.

318
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,200
You don't trust me?

319
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,300
Afraid not.

320
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,900
Well, that's too bad, because I'm not
signing that piece of paper.

321
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,600
You're a very beautiful woman, Gabrielle,

322
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,300
but...
you're not very bright.

323
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,700
See, if you don't sign it,

324
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,700
I'll pull the plug on the settlement
agreement, divorce you,

325
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:07,400
and then you get what amounts to about 50%
of our current savings, which is basically nothing.

326
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,600
So what do you expect to happen right now, Carlos --

327
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,300
sign the paper and jump right back into your arms?

328
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,000
Baby, it doesn't mean that I don't love you.

329
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,100
You know I think you're the perfect woman.

330
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,900
Oh, but I'm not.
I have flaws.

331
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,000
Flaws?

332
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,100
Mm-hmm.
I'll even give you an example.

333
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Remember the time when you were in jail and
you told me about your secret compartment,

334
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,300
and you told me to burn the papers
that I found in there?

335
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,400
Well, me being pretty, and therefore stupid,

336
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
I forgot.

337
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,500
You didn't burn the papers.

338
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Worse.
I read them.

339
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,400
Okay, okay --

340
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,800
You have some nerve talking to me about trust,

341
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,000
when you have a secret bank account
in the cayman islands.

342
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,400
That was a safety net for both of us.

343
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,100
I'll bet.

344
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,400
Have you told anyone else about this?

345
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,500
No, but I could.

346
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,900
Hey, is that why the prosecution
didn't have a case against you?

347
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,900
They couldn't find the profits you made.

348
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,800
So if I were you, Carlos,

349
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,400
I wouldn't mention the words "divorce,"
"trust," or "post-nup" ever again.

350
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,500
You don't want to piss me off.

351
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,900
I know, baby.
It hurts to lose.

352
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,900
Ante up.

353
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,200
Well, look at me.

354
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,100
Finally in on one of your legendary poker parties.

355
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,400
Susan's always telling me
how much fun you girls have.

356
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,700
The rules are simple -- we play for cash,
the dealer picks the game,

357
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,000
and unsubstantiated gossip is encouraged.

358
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,600
Bree, thanks again for watching my boys.

359
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,800
Are you sure they weren't too much to handle?

360
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,600
Oh, no, we had a wonderful time,
although I think porter had a little less fun.

361
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,300
Okay, I'll bet.

362
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,600
So, Sophie, Susan says you guys
are going to the spa tomorrow.

363
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,800
Is that an all-day thing?

364
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,900
What do you mean, Porter had less fun?

365
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,900
I'll raise.

366
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,000
Well, he was misbehaving, so I had to punish him.

367
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So, yes, Susan is treating me
to an entire day of beauty --

368
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,800
So when you say punishment,
what exactly are we talking about?

369
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,300
Oh, I had to spank him.

370
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,300
Okay, I will re-raise.

371
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,300
You spanked my son?

372
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,200
Las precis spa.

373
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,200
Yep, that's where we're going.

374
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,700
Lynette, is there a problem?

375
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,000
Tom and I don't believe in hitting our kids.
I thought you knew that.

376
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,300
Sorry. I-I didn't know.

377
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,700
It won't happen again.

378
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,400
Of course, I'm somewhat surprised
you don't spank them.

379
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,800
I mean, everybody knows they're a little bit...
out of control.

380
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,100
Wow, I'm just dragging today.
Should we put on another pot of coffee?

381
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,800
Yeah, I'll do it.

382
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,500
I'll -- I'll fold.

383
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,200
You know, you're right, Bree.
I've got a lot to learn about parenting,

384
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,300
and I feel so blessed to be getting sage advice
from such an impeccable mother like you.

385
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,000
I mean, your kids turned out perfect,
as long as you don't count Andrew.

386
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,100
Where is he again? Hmm?

387
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,700
Some kind of a boot camp for juvenile delinquents?

388
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,900
Okay, girls.

389
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,600
I never said I was perfect.

390
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,300
Oh, honey, nobody's blaming you.

391
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,300
The hell I'm not.

392
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,500
Lynette.

393
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,900
If you will excuse me...

394
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,700
Lynette, will you go after her?

395
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,400
She spanked my son.
I'm not apologizing.

396
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,700
Usually poker is more fun than this.

397
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,900
So help me, if you don't back me up on this,
I will lose it.

398
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,300
Yes, Bree shouldn't have spanked porter,
but it's not like she hurt him.

399
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,000
That is not the point.
You don't spank other people's children.

400
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
He was misbehaving.
She had to do something.

401
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,700
B-but make no mistake,
she definitely crossed the line.

402
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,200
Yeah, you're damn right she did.

403
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,300
She could have tried something else,
like a time-out,

404
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,100
or she could have simply threatened to spank him.

405
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,800
Yeah, 'cause that works out so well when we do it.

406
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,300
It does work.
It does work most of the time.

407
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,100
It used to work.

408
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,100
They've figured out that it's an empty threat.
They're onto us.

409
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:53,000
My mom used to beat the hell out of
my sisters and me, and I won't do it.

410
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,600
I will not become my mother.

411
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,900
Fine.

412
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,300
But the boys are getting older and smarter,
and eventually --

413
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,100
Believe me, eventually they're going to figure out
that they outnumber us, and then...

414
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,200
We're screwed.

415
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,400
Exactly.

416
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Excuse me, Zachary.
Would you mind helping me with these bags?

417
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,500
There's some banana bread in it for you if you do.

418
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,300
Uh, yeah, sure.

419
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,200
This is really good, Mrs. Tillman.
Thanks a lot.

420
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
You're welcome, Zachary.

421
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,800
You know,I've never actually been
in Mrs. Huber's house before.

422
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,700
Obviously, you haven't missed much.

423
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:57,300
This is the place where good taste goes to die.

424
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,500
So...
I heard you and your father arguing the other day.

425
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,100
Everything all right at home?

426
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,800
Yeah. We just have problems sometimes.

427
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,500
I bet you miss your mother.

428
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,800
I'm sure things were...
different when she was alive.

429
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,700
Such a warm,loving woman.

430
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,300
Y-you...
knew my mother?

431
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,700
Yep. Years ago in Utah.
We worked together.

432
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,800
I didn't know that.

433
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,500
It's true.

434
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:44,600
In fact...
I'll tell you a secret.

435
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,100
I once met you when you were a little baby.

436
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,800
Really?

437
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,500
Mm-hmm.

438
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:00,100
Your mother loved you so much, Zachary.

439
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:08,400
Of all the things I remember,
I remember that the most.

440
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,800
You want to know what else I remember?

441
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,700
How lovely your original name was.

442
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,500
Dana.

443
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,900
Isn't this nice?

444
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,600
Oh, just the two of us girls hanging out,
getting pretty.

445
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,800
Oh, thank you.

446
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,500
My pleasure.

447
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,700
So I was thinking
maybe you should call Morty.

448
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,100
You know, get started working things out.

449
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,700
Why would I want to work things out
with a man who abuses me?

450
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,400
Oh, you don't have to gasp.
My mother exaggerates.

451
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,800
She won't be happy till I have bruises.

452
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,000
Okay, um, can we just focus?

453
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,700
What I want to know is have you thought about
what's going to happen if you don't go back to Morty?

454
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,900
What do you mean?

455
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,500
Well, you don't have a place to live,
you don't like to work.

456
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,900
I mean, you didn't want to marry Morty,
so he doesn't have to pay you alimony.

457
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:38,500
It just -- if you don't go back to this man
who allegedly shoved you once in five years,

458
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,300
What are your options?

459
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,200
I thought I could live with you.

460
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
What?!

461
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
Aah!

462
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,800
Oh! Oh! Oh! Are you all right?

463
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,000
You kicked me!

464
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,700
Oh, I'm so sorry. I was startled.

465
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,300
Here, here, lean your head back.

466
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm not saying permanently.
Just for a couple of years.

467
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,400
You broke my nose.

468
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,000
No, no,it's just banged a little.

469
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,600
Till I get back on my feet.

470
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Can we talk about this later?

471
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,700
Should we call 911?

472
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,800
No, just a nosebleed. She's fine.

473
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
I thought you'd be excited by the idea.

474
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,600
It's not that I'm not excited.

475
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,700
I'm not stupid, Susan.

476
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,900
It's obvious you don't want me here.

477
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,100
No, that's not true!

478
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,700
Mom, don't go. Mom.
Come back.

479
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,400
You know, I need to --
we're good, right?

480
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,700
- Just go.
- Yeah.

481
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,800
Why aren't you dressed yet?

482
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,400
I wanted to wear Andrew's favorite color,
and then I realized that...

483
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,300
I don't know what it is.

484
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:28,000
Oh, honey,I think the fact that you
decided to come at all will make him happy.

485
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yours is blue,

486
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,400
Danielle loves pink,

487
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,000
and I have no idea
what my own son's favorite color is.

488
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,800
I'm telling you, it doesn't matter.

489
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,500
How can you say that it doesn't matter?
Of course it matters.

490
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,000
Bree --

491
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
That is what makes a good mother --

492
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,700
someone who knows their child inside and out
so that if they get in trouble, they know what to do.

493
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,700
I don't know him well enough.

494
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,500
You are a good mother.

495
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:12,200
Brown or green?
I just don't know.

496
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,100
I'm going to wait in the car.

497
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,900
Whenever you're ready.

498
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,300
Green.

499
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,400
I'll go with the green.
Everybody loves green.

500
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,300
I told you, I'm not signing this.

501
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,100
Oh, I think you are.

502
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:03,300
Because if you don't,
I will divorce you.

503
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,500
Then I'll go to the police.

504
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,800
And tell them what?

505
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,100
There's a secret bank account
in the cayman islands that no longer exists?

506
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,300
You moved the money?

507
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,300
Of course I moved the money.

508
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,300
Well, that was risky.
I mean, the feds are watching you right now.

509
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,600
I had to do something.

510
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,200
I couldn't just let you make a fool out of me.

511
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,800
Aah!

512
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,500
Oh, stop, Carlos, stop it!

513
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,300
- Put me down!
- Okay.

514
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,700
Put me down!

515
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,400
Let me go!

516
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
Aah!

517
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,700
Stop! You're hurting me!
Carlos!

518
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,100
Sign it.

519
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,400
Sign it!

520
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,300
I know, baby.

521
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,800
It hurts to lose.

522
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,100
Mr. And Mrs. Van De Kamp?

523
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,500
Uh, yes,um, is it our turn?

524
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,500
Well, uh, sort of. Andrew's waiting inside,
but...

525
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,600
what's wrong?

526
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,300
Well, he said he won't go forward with the session
if his mother's involved.

527
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,300
He only wants to talk to his dad.

528
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,600
We drove 200 miles to be here today.

529
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,000
This is unacceptable.

530
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I-I share your frustration.

531
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,400
All right, to hell with him, then.
We're going home.

532
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:10,800
No.

533
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
I am not going to let him insult you like this.

534
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,800
He blames me for his being here.
He blames me for everything.

535
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,400
And he's probably right.

536
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,700
Any mistakes made were made by both of us.

537
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,100
One of us should go talk to him,
see how he is.

538
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,700
I'm okay.

539
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,200
Are you sure?

540
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,200
Yeah. Fine.

541
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,100
Right this way.

542
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,000
Camp Hennessey COUNSELING CENTER

543
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,600
Mom. Mom!

544
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.What is it?

545
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,100
Why aren't you guys brushing your teeth?

546
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,400
Parker, what happened?

547
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Porter pushed me, and it fell in.

548
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,600
He pushed me first.

549
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
Can I flush it?

550
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,200
No, no.
I'll fish it out later, all right?

551
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,200
You're off the hook for tonight,
but not you two, so start brushing.

552
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,200
Preston, did you not hear me?
I said start brushing your teeth.

553
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,600
What are you doing?

554
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,500
Don't you dare.

555
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,800
Do it! Do it! Do it!

556
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Preston, don't listen to them.

557
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,100
Back away from the toilet,
and no one gets hurt.

558
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,700
Do it! Do it! Do it!

559
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,800
I mean it this time. These are not just words.

560
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,500
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

561
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,800
If you do this, so help me...

562
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,600
Hearing the hollowness of her own voice,

563
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Lynette realized that it was time
to get one step ahead.

564
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,300
Do it! Do it!

565
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:07,800
I will walk you over to Mrs. Van De Kamp's,
and we all know what happens when she gets mad.

566
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,800
Now...

567
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,200
go brush your teeth, and I want them to sparkle.
Go on.

568
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500
Sorry you had to bring your kid back.

569
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,300
What happened this time?

570
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,400
Well, couple months back,
I caught Todd going through my purse.

571
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,800
Oh. I hate when they do that.

572
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,500
Was he looking for weed or money?

573
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,000
Oh, who know sat this point?

574
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,300
Anyway, I'd knocked a couple back,
and things got heated.

575
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,000
Pretty soon, we were both screaming
and throwing stuff around the apartment.

576
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,500
Next thing you know, lady upstairs calls the cops on us.

577
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,900
Aw, give me a break.

578
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:54,800
So now I got some social worker
trying to tell me how to raise my boy.

579
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,800
Kids -- boy, if I knew then what I know now,

580
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,400
I would have had that hysterectomy 20 years ago.

581
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,800
Uh, Bree

582
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
Don't get up. I'll be quick.

583
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Andrew, all any parent can do is try to provide
their child with the tools to succeed in life --

584
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,300
education, love,
a good, clean, safe home.

585
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,400
Well, I have given you those things,
and I am through feeling guilty,

586
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,000
so if you want to piss your life away and blame it
on how horrible things are at home, you go ahead,

587
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,500
but I want it stated for the record
that I am a good mother. Do you hear me?

588
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,800
I am a good mother.

589
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,300
Bree...

590
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:48,100
Andrew just told me he thinks
he might be gay.

591
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,300
What?

592
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,900
That's why he wanted me to come in first.

593
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,500
He thought I could take it better.

594
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,900
Well, he was right. I will be waiting in the car.

595
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,700
Mrs. Solis.
What are you doing here?

596
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,400
Okay.

597
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Are your roommates here?

598
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,500
No. Are you okay?

599
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,900
Yeah.

600
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,900
What's this?

601
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,500
That is, uh...

602
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,900
Carlos just got a little rough.
Made me sign some papers.

603
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,100
He hurt you?

604
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,500
John, what are you doing?

605
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,200
I'm going to take care of this.

606
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,400
No, you're not going to do anything.

607
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,100
We're not going to let him get away with this.

608
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,100
Look, you really want to get back at him?

609
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,200
Then kiss me.

610
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,500
How's that going to help?

611
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Because one day, when the time is right,

612
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,000
I'm going to tell him how he drove me right into
your arms, and that's going to kill him.

613
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:07,500
And tonight just, whatever you do,
don't call me beautiful.

614
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,200
Oh, Morty, look who's here.

615
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,000
Hey, Millie. Hi, Morty.

616
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,900
Hey

617
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,400
Susie, what --what brings you here?

618
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,700
Mom -- I brought her over.

619
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,500
What-- what's she doing out there?

620
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,900
She says she won't come in until you go out
and apologize to her.

621
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,700
For -- for what?

622
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,700
For shoving her.

623
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,800
Well, I only shoved her 'cause she wouldn't --
she wouldn't stop hitting me.

624
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,900
Why was she hitting you?

625
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,100
I threw a --threw a book at her.

626
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,200
Morty.

627
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,500
It was --it was a paperback.

628
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,900
Well, even so...

629
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,200
At least I missed.

630
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,000
I mean, she --she hit me square in the gut.

631
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,300
You want to seethe bruise?

632
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,600
That's okay. That's okay.

633
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,200
It really hurt.

634
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,900
Yeah, I-I understand.

635
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:10,000
So...
could you, uh, just go out and apologize?

636
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,300
No.

637
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,800
Why?

638
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,700
Because I don't want her back.

639
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,400
Morty.

640
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,100
Look, I love her, but the --
the pancake shack is just starting to take off,

641
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,000
and we're talking about opening another one.

642
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,700
I mean, that--that's practically a chain.

643
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,400
I-I don't have time for her hysterics.

644
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,500
Yeah, I sympathize, I really do.

645
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,500
But you have to take her back.

646
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,200
Why?

647
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,900
Because she wants to move in with me.

648
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,800
Oh.

649
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,800
Morty, I-I'd like to have a relationship again,
and at my age, with a kid --

650
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,400
I mean, if she moves into my house,
even for a couple of years, I'm doomed.

651
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,900
Wa-wasn't there a plumber?
Your mother said you were in love with a plumber.

652
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,800
I am -- I mean, I was.
It didn't work out.

653
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,700
I'm -- I'm sorry.

654
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:00,700
If she moves in, she will burn up all my oxygen,
and I need it.

655
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,900
Please, can't you give her another chance?

656
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,700
You guys are really good together, you know?

657
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,800
When you're -- when --when there's no violence.

658
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,500
Well, we --we do have chemistry.

659
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,100
Absolutely.

660
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,100
You know -- you know,the sex was like...
wow.

661
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,400
I mean, there was this one time
we were coming home on the interstate --

662
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,200
You don't have to sell me. Go.
Just go talk to her.

663
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,500
Now.

664
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,000
Okay.

665
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
That was a mighty big sigh.

666
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,500
I just keep thinking it's coming, Millie,
and I can't stop it.

667
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,000
What's that?

668
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,700
The day my mother will need to move in with me,
and I won't have a choice.

669
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,800
Mm-hmm.

670
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,200
I know it's years away.
She's youthful and vibrant, thank god.

671
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,100
But time flies.

672
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,200
One day, she won't be able to take care of
herself anymore, and I'll have to step up.

673
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,900
I suppose that's true.

674
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:12,100
I think it's nature's little joke that children
ultimately end up parenting their parents.

675
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,700
Well, when that day comes, I'll be ready.

676
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,400
Honey, you better get out there.

677
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,600
Stop it!  Aah!

678
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,600
What? Stop! What are you doing?!

679
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,000
What are you doing?

680
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,100
Hey.

681
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,900
Look... I just wanted to apologize.

682
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,300
Lynette, don't.

683
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,200
The fact that you just crossed that street
means the world to me,

684
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,800
and if anyone here should apologize, it's me.

685
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,300
Thank you.

686
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,900
Looks like Tom's got the mob under control.

687
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:31,000
You want to have some coffee,
sit around, bitch about our kids?

688
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I would love to.

689
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,800
Okay.

690
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,200
Children come into the world
with their own agendas.

691
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,900
Some to brighten our days...

692
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:55,900
some to test our patience...

693
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:02,700
some to give us purpose...

694
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:09,500
some to take care of us.
