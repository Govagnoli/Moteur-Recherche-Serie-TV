00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,600
<font color=yellow>Previously on "desperate housewives"...</font>
We're making a mistake. These are nice people.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,400
My money says one of them isn't.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,400
How creepy is Mrs. Huber's sister?

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,700
<font color=yellow>Promises were made.</font>

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,600
I'm going to find out exactly what happened to her.

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,000
<font color=yellow>Marriages came undone.</font>

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,700
Gabrielle and I are about to start a family.

8
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,700
Well, we're not negotiating my uterus.

9
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,800
George, would you go out to dinner with me?

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,100
You mean like a date?

11
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,900
A date?

12
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,003
<font color=yellow>And the truth...</font>

13
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:21,600
You burned your rival's house down.

14
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,600
<font color=yellow>Was denied.</font>

15
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,900
I absolutely did not do that thing you accused me of.

16
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:35,400
<font color=yellow>Martha Huber waited her whole life for something 
to happen to her, something exciting.

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,300
<font color=yellow>As a child, she hoped to be kidnapped 
by a band of pirates.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,900
<font color=yellow>As a teenager, she dreamt of being discovered 
by a hollywood talent scout.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,700
<font color=yellow> As a young woman, she fantasized a handsome 
millionaire would sweep her off her feet.

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,500
<font color=yellow>But the years had flown by, and still nothing 
exciting had ever happened to Martha Huber.

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,000
<font color=yellow>Until the night she was murdered.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,800
Hello, Mrs. Huber.

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,600
Paul.

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,500
Let me give you a hand.

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,600
That's really not necessary.

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,200
I insist.

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,100
<font color=yellow>In those last moments, it occurred to her 
in addition to being boring,

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,100
<font color=yellow>Life could also be very cruel.

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,200
<font color=yellow>Luckily for Mrs. Huber, death was far more merciful.

30
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,900
What do you think?

31
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,500
That's our missing woman, all right.

32
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,600
Oh, jeez. Didn't take the media long to get wind of this.

33
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,800
Make sure no one contaminates my crime scene.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Hey, little lady.

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,900
A lot of people are looking for you, you know that?

36
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,200
Your face is going to be on the front page of 
every paper in this state.

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,900
How's that for exciting?

38
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,100
<font color=yellow>Officer Jackson couldn't be sure,
but for a brief moment,</font>

39
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,400
<font color=yellow>he thought he saw the corpse of Martha Huber...

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,100
<font color=yellow>smile.

41
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,000
<font color=F62B97>Episode 12 : Every Day a Little Death

42
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,200
<font color=yellow>Death had come once again to Wisteria Lane.

43
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,100
I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.

44
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,300
We found your sister's body.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,200
<font color=yellow>Word of the tragedy would soon spread 
throughout the neighborhood,</font>

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:30,500
<font color=yellow>but for now, people went about their lives 
as they always did -- blissfully unaware.</font>

47
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,700
Hello. Anybody home?

48
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,100
In the kitchen.

49
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,200
Good news.

50
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,500
I finished my book, so I thought to celebrate, 
you could take me out to lunch.

51
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Hey, Susan.

52
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,600
Uh, can we do a rain check?

53
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,300
Edie and I are just looking over 
the plans to rebuild her house.

54
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,100
My insurance company's finally 
cutting my check next week,

55
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,500
and there's only one plumber I want.

56
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,000
So don't expect to see this guy for a few months.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,300
I'm going to be riding him hard.

58
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,700
Well, if anybody can go the distance, 
he can. I should know.

59
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,300
See ya.

60
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,100
Uh, Mike?

61
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,800
Mike?

62
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,300
We're on the clock.

63
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,100
Hey, Felicia. What's up?

64
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,600
Edie?

65
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
They found Martha.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,100
Here. Blow. Good. All right.

67
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,400
Come on. This is going to be fun. Follow me.

68
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,300
Excuse me.

69
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,400
Yeah?

70
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,200
You can't do that.

71
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,900
I'm here for the 10:00 A.M.
Yoga meditation class.

72
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,600
Unfortunately, the day care center's full.

73
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,700
Yeah, I noticed that, but every time I come here, it's full.

74
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,100
It's a popular class.
And the other moms come early.

75
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,800
Look, all I can tell you is plan ahead next time.

76
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,300
Uh, Lauren, I'm a mother of four.

77
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,000
Today I had to get up at 5:00,

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,200
make lunches, make breakfast, 
drop the twins off at school,

79
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,500
and get across town lugging a baby and a sick child.

80
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,000
Telling me to plan ahead is like 
telling me to sprout wings,

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,200
and it's things like being told to plan 
ahead that make me so crazy

82
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,400
that yoga is the only thing that relaxes me,

83
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,600
except I show up here, and I can't get in, 
and you tell me to plan ahead.

84
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,900
It's a vicious cycle.

85
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,300
See how that works?

86
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,600
I get it.

87
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,800
But if I broke the rules for you,
I'd have to break them for the other moms, too,

88
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,500
and then the moms who actually followed 
the rules would get all pissed at me,

89
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,700
and then I'd have to get pissy right back,

90
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,200
and before you know it, I don't 
have time to read my magazine.

91
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,000
See how that works?

92
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,700
I hope someday, you have lots of children.

93
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,500
Hello?

94
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,600
Oh, hey, Susan. Listen, I can't talk.
I'm in the middle of something here that --

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,100
what?

96
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,300
I had a wonderful time today.

97
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,500
Thank you. I did, too.

98
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,470
Sorry I can't invite you in for coffee or...

99
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,000
No, I get it. Rex still lives in the house.
It would be awkward.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,100
Yeah, and I would rather cut off 
my hand than hurt his feelings.

101
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,500
It'll, um... it'll be a lot easier once 
he gets well enough to move out.

102
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,600
So do you want to have lunch tomorrow?

103
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,900
I'd love to.

104
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,400
Okay. Wow.

105
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Pick me up at 1:00, and we'll do something fun.

106
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,200
I'll see you then.

107
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Okay. Oh, packages.

108
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,000
O h.

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,300
Thank you.

110
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Hello.

111
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Oh, hi, Lynette.

112
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
What?

113
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,100
Sir, watch your head.

114
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,800
Hi, honey.

115
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,200
Welcome home.

116
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,900
Thanks, guys.

117
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,100
Take it easy.

118
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,700
Come on, honey.
Let's celebrate.

119
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,400
Sorry it's the cheap stuff.
I had to economize.

120
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,900
But now that you're back, we can 
restock the wine cellar.

121
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,700
Let's toast.

122
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
It's very good to be back.

123
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,600
What's that?

124
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:10,400
It transmits to this -- my electronic monitoring device.

125
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,800
Didn't the lawyer tell you?

126
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Tell me what?

127
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,900
I'm on house arrest.
It's a condition of my bail.

128
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,700
Uh, No. No, he neglected to tell me that.

129
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,800
Yeah, if I move more than 100 feet from 
that telephone, an alarm sounds.

130
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,100
If I keep going, it transmits a signal 
to the FBI, and I'm back in jail.

131
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,000
But how are you going to work?

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,800
I can't. I can't do anything.

133
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,500
Uh, no, no, no. That's unreasonable.

134
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,700
What do they expect us to do for money?

135
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,400
Well, the lawyer's working on unfreezing the accounts.

136
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,800
And in the meantime, I mean, haven't 
you been booking modeling jobs?

137
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,700
Carlos, this is not like New York where I made thousands
of dollars a day modeling haute couture.

138
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,500
I'm doing boat shows.

139
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,600
I spend eight hours a day doing this.

140
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,100
Well, I'd buy two boats from you.

141
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,500
Come on.

142
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,000
Where's my toast?

143
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,600
Welcome home.

144
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,200
Hello.

145
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,203
Hi, Bree.

146
00:09:20,203 --> 00:09:21,807
What?

147
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,500
If you find anything in your sister's belongings
that might shed some light on her death

148
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:35,300
letters or a datebook, please call me immediately.

149
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,000
I believe she did keep a diary or something.
I'll look around for it.

150
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,300
Look at them all

151
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,700
-- vultures, pretending to care,
when all they really want are the sordid details.

152
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,500
I don't know. I think they just want to show their support.

153
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,700
Please. Human beings feed on misery.

154
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,800
Well, we might as well give the people what they want.

155
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,200
Hello.

156
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,600
I want to thank you all for coming out here
and expressing your genuine sorrow and disbelief.

157
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,200
My sister Martha would have been so touched.

158
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,500
I know that many of you have questions.

159
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,800
I've just spoken with the police, who are still 
putting together the details of what happened.

160
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,900
What they do know is Martha died a violent death.

161
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,200
Oh.

162
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,600
Yes, I know.

163
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,500
It's hard to hear.

164
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,800
Apparently, there was a struggle.

165
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:43,600
They found scratching and bruising on her body,
several broken bones, and traces of dirt in her lungs...

166
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:51,800
which leads us to believe that she was still alive at the time of her burial, and probably in great pain.

167
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:59,000
But the good news is there are no signs 
that she had been molested.

168
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:07,100
Now I think it's time that you return 
to your homes, to your loved ones.

169
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:14,300
Oh, in lieu of a memorial service,
I'll be holding an estate sale day after tomorrow.

170
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,900
Please -- no personal checks.

171
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,900
<font color=yellow>By the next morning, everyone on Wisteria Lane 
was aware of Martha Huber's demise...

172
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,100
- Hey, guys, check out my dead woman.
- <font color=yellow>With no exceptions.</font>

173
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,900
- Okay, boys.
- Hey, mom.

174
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,200
You see this gum?

175
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,100
If you promise to be quiet while I am downstairs 
playing cards, it's all yours. Deal?

176
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,200
- Yeah.
- Deal.

177
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,200
Yeah, okay. That's what I like to hear. All right, good.

178
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,200
I mean, what are the odds?
First Mary Alice, and then Mrs. Huber?

179
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,300
I mean, it's shocking.

180
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,700
Yeah, but this is different.
Someone was actually murdered on our street.

181
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,200
I remember talking to her right before she disappeared.

182
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
You did? What'd you talk about?

183
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,900
Oh, actually, she yelled at me for not 
bringing my garbage cans in.

184
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,100
I'm going to miss her.

185
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,800
Edie.

186
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,900
Hi.

187
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,300
Hi.

188
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,300
Come on in.

189
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,900
Oh, you're all here.

190
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,900
Yeah, tuesday is poker day.

191
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:22,500
Really? Oh, you know, I love poker.

192
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,400
Okay, then.

193
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,100
Well, here's the deal.

194
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,700
Since the ice queen isn't doing anything 
to memorialize her sister,

195
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:41,300
I have decided to carry Martha's ashes up 
to torch lake and scatter them myself.

196
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,100
It's where her husband proposed.

197
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,100
That's so sweet.

198
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,100
I know.

199
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,400
So I thought that some of the neighbors 
could caravan up there,

200
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,100
and we'd have a little ceremony.

201
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,600
I've printed out maps if anyone needs one, 
and the dress is semi-formal.

202
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,500
You know, Edie, I'd love to go,
but, um, I just got back into modeling,

203
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,700
You know, just for fun, and I have a gig tomorrow.

204
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,100
I can't leave them hanging.

205
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,400
I wish I would have known earlier.
I would have arranged a sitter.

206
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,600
Darn, I have to take Rex to his angiogram.

207
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,000
Hmm.

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,500
Well, Mayer? What's your excuse?

209
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,200
Um, just, you know, busy stuff.

210
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,700
Well, your friends are much better liars.

211
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,600
Okay, mommy's friends are gone now, and you can --

212
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,100
Oh.

213
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,500
Ow! Ow!

214
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,400
Well, yeah, I know it hurts,

215
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:00,800
but that's what you get when you let your brothers 
put bubble gum in your hair -- pain and misery.

216
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,100
Are you mad at me?

217
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,900
Yes. Yes, I am mad at you.

218
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,600
Ow! Ow.

219
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,400
And I'm also cranky. You know how 
you get when you haven't taken a nap?

220
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,900
Well, mommies are the same way.
We need our downtime, and if we don't get it --

221
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,400
Sorry.

222
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,000
We end up saying and doing things 
which we don't normally do.

223
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Ow.

224
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,500
And that's frustrating for me, too,
'cause I do want to be the best mommy I can be.

225
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,200
I think you're the best mommy in the world.

226
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,900
Well, that's sweet of you, but... it's not exactly true.

227
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,100
I was so afraid when I suggested a picnic 
that you'd make fun of me,

228
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:48,200
But I just think it's such a lovely, old-fashioned 
way to spend an afternoon.

229
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,500
Well, as it happens, I'm an old-fashioned kind of guy.

230
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,100
Oh, and we got so lucky with the weather.
It's just absolutely --

231
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,600
You know, your lunch hour's almost up.

232
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,700
We probably should be getting 
you back to the pharmacy.

233
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,100
Wait.

234
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,600
I've had such a good time these last few days,
I just want to show my appreciation.

235
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,800
Another gift? I hope it's not another orchid.
They're so expensive.

236
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,500
Relax. This didn't cost me a dime.

237
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,300
Okay.

238
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,700
George, you shouldn't have.

239
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:35,000
This... is a 9-millimeter luger p08.

240
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,100
From the moment you said you were in the NRA,
I knew I wanted to give it to you.

241
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,300
I can't accept this, George.

242
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
This is an antique. It's too valuable.

243
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,100
It's okay. My grandpa left it to me.

244
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,200
It was surrendered to him by 
a soldier during World War II,

245
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,700
and since I don't know how to shoot...

246
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,300
It's so lovely.

247
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,500
I mean, look at that handle.
Is that mother-of-pearl?

248
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,900
I think so. Only the officers' 
models had that.

249
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,700
Do you really like it?

250
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh, absolutely.

251
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:06,600
Oh, George. This is just 
so much better than an orchid.

252
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,900
Hi. I'm Susan Mayer.

253
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,200
I saw you from across the street.
I thought you might need a hand.

254
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
No thanks.

255
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,100
I-I'm sorry for what happened.

256
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,100
It must be really hard, not knowing who did it or why.

257
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,700
You must feel helpless.

258
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,700
A bit.

259
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,200
I'm hoping her journals will provide some insight.

260
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,300
Journals.

261
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,900
Yes, Martha kept them for years.

262
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,500
Oh.

263
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,200
So she must have written a lot of things in them.

264
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,800
Every mundane detail of her life.

265
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,400
And everyone else's, for that matter.

266
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,000
The police want to see them,

267
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,900
but I'm stalling them till I have a chance 
to read through them first myself.

268
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,300
Wouldn't want any embarrassing 
family secrets getting out.

269
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,100
That's smart. That's -- that's good.

270
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,800
That's good to hear.

271
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
I am so screwed.

272
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,500
Mom, calm down.

273
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,200
Everything about the fire and the measuring cup 
is going to be in that journal.

274
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,700
Everyone is going to think I'm an arsonist.

275
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,400
It may not be as bad as it looks.

276
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,800
What, you think there's a chance Mrs. Huber didn't 
write about it in her journal?

277
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,700
Please. It's great dirt.
I even put it in my journal.

278
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,600
You're going to have to get to Mrs. Britt and come clean, 
convince her it was an accident.

279
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,700
If she doesn't press charges,
the police will probably just let it go.

280
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,900
Are you high? Edie hates me.

281
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,300
That's why you're going to grovel 
at her feet and beg forgiveness.

282
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,800
That's right.

283
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,800
You're going to have to suck up to Edie Britt.

284
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,200
Hey, Mike.

285
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,700
As you can probably see by now, I took back my money

286
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,800
and what little information you managed 
to dig up on your neighbors.

287
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,200
Your replacement's going to need it.

288
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,600
Pack up and move on with your life.
Sorry for the mess.

289
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,000
We're here.

290
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,100
10 minutes early.
Sign me up?

291
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,200
You just missed the rush. Sorry.

292
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,500
No, no. I-I planned ahead.

293
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,200
We're -- we're 10 minutes early.

294
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,100
Oh, my god.

295
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,100
What?

296
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,500
When you said you had a sick child,
I had no idea.

297
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,100
How long has it been?

298
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,500
Uh, just kind of snuck up on us.

299
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,200
And he's so young, too.
God, it just breaks my heart.

300
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,300
Oh.

301
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
No, see, here's the thing

302
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,600
You go ahead into class.
I'll find room for your kids.

303
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,500
Okay.

304
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,700
Hey, Edie.

305
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,900
Susan.

306
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,600
Boy, I've got to say, I envy you.

307
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,000
In the name of god, why?

308
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,800
Well, you get to build your dream house -- for free.

309
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,800
I mean, in a weird way, your house 
burning down was really a good thing.

310
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,100
There's nothing good about it.

311
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:56,400
I can't replace the memories, the photographs, 
the -- is there something you want?

312
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,100
Okay, here's the deal, Edie --

313
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,300
I -- I --

314
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,700
I-I -- what?

315
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,700
Spit it out already. I'm busy.

316
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,300
I just wanted to see how you were holding up.

317
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,000
You know, with Mrs. Huber and everything.

318
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,100
My best friend was murdered and 
stuffed into a garbage bag,

319
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:27,400
and nobody cares enough to... 
go with me to spread her ashes.

320
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,500
I'll go with you, Edie.

321
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,900
Hey.

322
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,700
Oh, thank god. I'm starving.

323
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,700
Well, dig in. I am way too tired to eat.

324
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Hey. I'm sorry. Come here.

325
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,000
Mm?

326
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,600
So did you get to go by the hospital, visit mama?

327
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,900
I worked 10 hours today.

328
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,900
I'll go by tomorrow.
She doesn't even know when I'm there.

329
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,800
She's going to wake up soon, I know it.

330
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,700
And you know what would make her really happy?

331
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,700
Oh, god, if you say a grandchild, so help me, Carlos --

332
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,900
Gabrielle, please.

333
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,500
No, you promised -- no babies.

334
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,300
Things change.

335
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,600
Yeah, I know. The feds towed away my maserati, 
my husband is -- is a felon,

336
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,500
and I spend my days getting groped by fat tractor 
salesmen at trade shows.

337
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
I am well aware things change.

338
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,800
A baby is solid, a constant.

339
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,700
And who's going to be changing the diapers when 
you're pumping iron in a federal prison? Huh?

340
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,300
I like my lifestyle, and I don't want you to kill it.

341
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,000
Well, look around, Gabrielle. It's already dead,

342
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,900
and there's nothing you can control.

343
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,700
Maybe, but having a baby?

344
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,100
That I can control.

345
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,200
You I can control.

346
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,400
Hey, you can't talk to me like that.
I'm still the man of this house.

347
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,700
Oh, really?

348
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,700
The man of the house?

349
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,500
Don't walk away from me.

350
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,300
Hey, hey, my food.

351
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,300
Gabrielle! Come back here right now!

352
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,900
Hey!

353
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,600
Hey!

354
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,100
I wouldn't go too much farther.
You're going to end up back in prison.

355
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,900
Damn it, Gabrielle, get inside now!

356
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,700
Mmm.

357
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,400
Hey, I waited all day for that!

358
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
Mmm, it's perfect.

359
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,800
Oh. Mmm.

360
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:45,000
Crispy and burnt on the outside,
but nice and steamy on the inside.

361
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,200
Aah, aah, aah!

362
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,600
Mnh-mnh.

363
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,900
Mmm.

364
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,000
You're the man of the house?
You can't even leave it.

365
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,400
Mmm. Oh. Oh.

366
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
I love this.

367
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,100
It's like a little adventure.
I've never fired a gun before.

368
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,600
The memory of this night will stay with you forever.

369
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Really?

370
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,200
Oh, yeah. You always remember your first time.

371
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,500
God, I hope I brought enough bullets.

372
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:32,100
You know, Bree, I -- I can't tell you what these 
last few days have meant to me.

373
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,600
Finally getting out of the house and trying new things.

374
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Oh. Well, we sure have had some fun.

375
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,400
No, no, it's -- it's more than that.

376
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm starting to forget what it feels like to be lonely.

377
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,400
Oh, George, that's so sweet.

378
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,200
Now come on. Let's go shoot something.

379
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,200
Now, before I fire a handgun, I like to go over a few 
of the basics just to make sure I'm ready, okay?

380
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,200
So number one, strong stance.

381
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,900
Two, high hand grasp.

382
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,200
Three, hard grip.

383
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,400
Four, front sight.

384
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,600
Five, release the safety, and then 
squeeze the trigger slowly.

385
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,600
What's a high hand grasp?

386
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Here. Take the gun.

387
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,500
Okay, now, when you're firing a semiautomatic,

388
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,500
you want the web of your hand all the way up 
against the edge of the backstrap.

389
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,900
What is that perfume you're wearing?

390
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,900
Uh, I'm not wearing perfume.

391
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,700
Are you sure? Because you smell amazing.

392
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,900
Oh, I was making macaroons before I left the house.

393
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,900
Okay, now, I want you to hold the gun
like you're holding a beautiful white dove.

394
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:43,300
Hold it firmly enough that it can't fly away,
but not so firmly that you can kill it. Got it?

395
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,500
I think so.

396
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,600
Okay.

397
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,900
Now all you have to do is take a deep breath 
and squeeze the trigger.

398
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,600
George!

399
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,300
Aah!

400
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,600
Oh! Oh, George!

401
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,200
Oh, my god! Are you okay?

402
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,100
Oh, George! I'm sorry!

403
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,700
Hey.

404
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,500
Hey, George.

405
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,700
I'm so sorry you lost your toe.

406
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,700
The doctor said it's the middle one, 
so your balance shouldn't be affected.

407
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,600
I mean, this really won't change your life one little bit.

408
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,600
Please say something.

409
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,200
I've always dreamed that before I died,

410
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,800
I would get to kiss a truly beautiful woman.

411
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:44,800
I finally get the chance, and I end up blowing off a toe.

412
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
I'm not surprised.

413
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,800
This type of thing always happens to me, 
and I -- I know I'll get over it.

414
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,000
But the thing that I don't think I'll ever get over

415
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,400
is that when I did kiss you, you pulled away from me.

416
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,700
Why did you do that, Bree?

417
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,000
I was just caught off-guard.

418
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,900
But we're dating.

419
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,300
Why would it be so surprising I would try to kiss you?

420
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,700
I'm still married to Rex. I mean, we're not 
even legally separated yet.

421
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,500
He cheated on you.

422
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,500
You said you were going to hate him forever.

423
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,700
You shouldn't listen to a woman who's 
just had her heart broken.

424
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,900
We tend to lie.

425
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,300
'Cause I think we're already late. Hi. Sorry.

426
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,700
<font color=yellow>Lynette knew serious illness was not 
a matter to be treated lightly.</font>

427
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,700
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

428
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:57,200
I'm just picking up my sick, poor, little baby boy.
All right, here. There. Okay. Come on.

429
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,200
<font color=yellow>But making her yoga class 
was a matter of life and death.

430
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,500
Sorry. Sorry.

431
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,900
Excuse me. Excuse me.

432
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,500
Hey, Lauren, hi.

433
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,200
We had a really rough morning.

434
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,700
Don't give it another thought.

435
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,200
I bet you were a cheerleader 
in high school, weren't you?

436
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,800
My junior year. How'd you know?

437
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,200
Girls like you were always cheerleaders.

438
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,500
Clear skin, honor roll, popular.

439
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:31,400
In high school, I was the girl that hung out with 
the freaks on the loading dock and smoked.

440
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,800
Everyone hated us.

441
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,300
Well, you know high school.
Thank god we leave that behind.

442
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,900
See, I don't think we do.

443
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,100
I'm still the outsider that doesn't 
get invited to the cool parties,

444
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:49,500
and you're still the perky cheerleader who thinks 
that she can pull the wool over everyone's eyes.

445
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,700
What?

446
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,500
You came on this trip, paid for the gas, and look at you.

447
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,700
You're changing this flat 
when you know I have auto club.

448
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,000
You want something from me.

449
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,200
I just know Mrs. Huber's death's 
been hard on you. I want to help.

450
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,400
That's a lie.

451
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,200
Why would you think I was lying?

452
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,500
Because we're still in high school.

453
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
The old rules apply.

454
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,900
The cool kids only want to talk to the freaks
when they need something.

455
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:21,200
Now, you're not getting back in my car 
until you tell me what it is that you want.

456
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:30,600
Okay. Look, uh, I --

457
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,700
I just haven't always treated you well,
and I want to make amends.

458
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:43,300
I still think you're full of crap, but we 
don't have time to debate this.

459
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,600
You know, for what it's worth,
I would have talked to you in high school.

460
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Of all the lies you've told...

461
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,700
That's the worst.

462
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,100
Single malt?

463
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,300
Have a seat. Take a load off.

464
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,000
I want it all back.

465
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,400
My maps, pictures, my gun... and the money.

466
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
Oh, my money, you mean.

467
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,400
You are never going to get somebody who cares 
as much about finding deirdre as I do.

468
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,900
Why, because you loved her so much?

469
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,100
You abandoned her, remember?

470
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,500
You saved yourself, found yourself a nice, safe wife,
and you left my daughter to rot,

471
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,900
so forgive me if I question your level of commitment.

472
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,200
I need to do this.

473
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,300
Why are you fighting me?

474
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,200
Because you haven't been moving fast enough,
and I'm running out of time.

475
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,800
What do you mean?

476
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,200
It seems I have a tumor.

477
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,900
Apparently, it's pressing on my brain.

478
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:13,600
I'm going to die, and I'd like to know what 
happened to my daughter before I do.

479
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,300
Oh, that was the best class ever.
I just feel terrific. Thank you.

480
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,300
Oh, Lynette, this is my friend Callie.

481
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

482
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,800
She wanted to meet Parker.

483
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,600
Oh, really? Why?

484
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,100
I'm a survivor.

485
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,400
Breast cancer.
About six years ago.

486
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,400
Can I hug your son?

487
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,100
Sure.

488
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,700
I know exactly what you're going through,
but you're going to be brave, okay?

489
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,600
And you are going to survive this,
because you are a tough little soldier.

490
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,200
Mommy, am I dying?

491
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,700
No. You're not dying.

492
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,300
People just think that because I shaved your head.

493
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,700
You shaved his head?

494
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,800
Yeah, my brothers put bubble gum in my hair.

495
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,200
Sorry.

496
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
Excuse me.

497
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,400
<font color=yellow>And just like that,

498
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:40,200
<font color=yellow>Lynette realized the road to enlightenment
and spiritual well-being was now closed to her.</font>

<font color=lightgreen>- Shanta Yoga Center-

500
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:50,200
Oh, George. What -- w-what a surprise.

501
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,900
See, uh, I've been doing a lot of thinking 
since we talked at the hospital,

502
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,800
and...

503
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
and?

504
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,900
Bree, I don't care what we call it.

505
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:05,600
We can call it dating, we can call it hanging out.
Whatever it is, I just want to be with you.

506
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,800
See, uh, I really need our friendship back.

507
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,900
I don't think that would be wise.

508
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,900
Why not?

509
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,500
Well, I mean, wouldn't you keep hoping that, in time,

510
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:22,100
I would feel the same way about 
you as you feel about me?

511
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,100
Maybe.

512
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,400
Oh, George.

513
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,000
I wish you wouldn't say "oh, George" like that,

514
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,000
like I'm so pathetic for even thinking 
that you could love me someday.

515
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,200
I don't think you're pathetic. It's just that --

516
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,000
I can't.

517
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Aw, jeez.

518
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,100
Aw, jeez.

519
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,800
Oh, George, please don't go.

520
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,500
Why can't we talk this over?

521
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,300
- George --
- Don't -- ugh!

522
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,600
Oh, my god.

523
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,600
- Oh, George, here, 
- Take -- get away from me!

524
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,300
Lean on me.

525
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,600
I don't need you.

526
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,100
I don't need anybody!

527
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,600
You know, honey, tonight's the last 
night of the boat show.

528
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,700
We'll be able to spend some time together before 
the home and garden thing next week.

529
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,500
Carlos?

530
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,800
I'm going to jail, and you're not going 
to be here when I get back.

531
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,500
What?

532
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,200
It's true, and I won't blame you.

533
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,600
Don't talk like that.
Everything's going to be fine.

534
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,900
We're going to sort this mess out, and you're 
going to be back on top again.

535
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,200
Gabby, they could find me guilty on every charge.

536
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
I could go to prison for five years.

537
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,500
We'd probably have to sell the house,
you'd have to keep working --

538
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,600
Okay, Carlos --

539
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,400
If that happens, can you promise you won't ever leave?

540
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,000
I promise.

541
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,100
I got to go.

542
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,400
This is far enough.

543
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,800
Do you need help with the container?

544
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,300
No, I got it open. I'm good.

545
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,900
So what are you waiting for?

546
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,100
I just need a moment, okay?

547
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:35,500
Oh, of course. Take your time.

548
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,100
Are you okay?

549
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,100
No, I'm just so grateful.

550
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,900
I know. I-I know.
Mrs. Huber was a good friend to you.

551
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,600
I'm not talking about Martha.

552
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,900
I'm grateful to you.

553
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,200
Me?

554
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,700
Yeah, I've been such a bitch to 
you over the years, and...

555
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:14,400
Here you are, rowing me out to dump her ashes.

556
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,100
Well, it's -- it's really no -- no big deal.

557
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,900
Yes, it is.

558
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,900
You stepped up when nobody else would, and --

559
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,800
and here I am, thinking you have an ulterior motive.

560
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,900
Oh. God, Susan,
you're such a good person.

561
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,600
And I'm such a bitch.

562
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,500
Oh, Edie, you're not that bad, and --
and -- and believe me,

563
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,100
I'm -- I'm not that good.

564
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,100
Oh, yes, you are.

565
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,200
Oh, please don't do this.

566
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,800
You know, Martha may be gone...

567
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,100
But the good lord above has 
shown me that I'm not alone.

568
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,900
I am so grateful that I still have a true friend.

569
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,700
Thank you, Susan.

570
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,400
Edie, I burned your house down.

571
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,500
Huh?

572
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,800
I was scared that you were sleeping with Mike,
and so I let myself in, and I-I snuck around.

573
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,000
I-I accidentally knocked a candle over, 
and the whole -- just -- I'm so sorry.

574
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,500
Can you ever forgive me?

575
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,300
Row me back.

576
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,600
Now.

577
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,100
I'm sorry about before -- shoving you.

578
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:48,200
I didn't mean -- I'm not going to break.

579
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,500
I'm sorry, too.

580
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,900
Questioning your commitment, your guts --

581
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,200
I know better than that.

582
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,500
Yeah. You should.

583
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:06,000
I keep this with me all the time 
to remind me why I'm there.

584
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,900
If it turns out someone hurt her, I want them dead.

585
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,100
We need to be sure before we do anything.

586
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,700
Well, when you're sure,

587
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,100
I know I can trust you to take care of it.

588
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:23,500
After all, you already killed for her once.

589
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,900
Yeah, is this the pharmacy?

590
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,500
My wife asked me to call.
She lost her prescription.

591
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,200
Gabrielle Solis.

592
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,600
Yeah, the birth-control pills.

593
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,500
Great, great. She'll be very relieved.

594
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,300
Can she get enough for a couple months?

595
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,300
Yeah, that's right.
Better safe than sorry.

596
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,200
Thanks a lot.

597
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,200
Oh, do you guys deliver?

598
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,200
Edie, please talk to me.

599
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:42,300
I've been thinking about this for the last 90 miles, 
and you don't have to forgive me.

600
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
You can go to the police, kick me.

601
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,500
You can burn my house down.

602
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,600
You just have to know that I am so racked with guilt,

603
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:56,300
I don't think it's possible for me to suffer 
any more than I'm already suffering.

604
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:02,400
Boy, I'd like to put that theory to the test.

605
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,300
Well... whatever you want to do, Edie.

606
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,100
Just know that I'm sorry.

607
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,800
I'm not going to the police.

608
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,500
You're not?

609
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,400
No.

610
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,300
The insurance company will just want to investigate, 
and it'll delay my check.

611
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,000
Thank you.

612
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,600
But...

613
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,300
there is something I want you to do for me.

614
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,100
Of course. Anything.

615
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,100
You name it. What?

616
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,900
I want to be invited to your poker game.

617
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,900
Our poker games?

618
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:51,500
I'm not saying I'll go, and I'm not saying that you and 
your little friends have to be nice to me,

619
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:57,400
but every once in a while, yeah, it'd be nice to be asked.

620
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:04,200
Well, uh, we meet on tuesdays, and it's potluck lunch.
Everybody has to bring something.

621
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,300
I'm not bringing anything.

622
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,900
Oh, you don't have to.

623
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,400
Well, this is good.

624
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,900
Thank you.

625
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,300
I guess I should go take a shower and...

626
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,900
wash Mrs. Huber off me.

627
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,700
Hold it.

628
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:30,900
I can't stand the thought of Martha's ashes 
going down some sewer drain.

629
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,500
Well, Edie, I-I have to clean up.

630
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,200
Well, this is such a beautiful lawn.

631
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,200
We could put her to rest right here.

632
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,000
On my front lawn?

633
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,400
Why not?

634
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,700
She could spend all of eternity looking at her house 
and keep an eye on the neighborhood.

635
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,100
She'd like that.

636
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,700
Stand over here. I'll hose you off.

637
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,100
I don't think so.

638
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,300
You owe me.

639
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,800
Martha... I'm going to miss you.

640
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,900
<font color=yellow>Death is inevitable.

641
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,600
<font color=yellow>It's a promise made to each of us at birth.

642
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:44,200
<font color=yellow>But before that promise is kept, we all 
hope something will happen to us.</font>

643
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:49,400
<font color=yellow>Whether it's the thrill of romance...

644
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,800
Hey, come back here!

645
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,800
<font color=yellow>The joy of raising a family...

646
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,300
I'm going to get you!
I'm going to get you!

647
00:41:55,300 --> 00:42:00,500
<font color=yellow>Or the anguish of great loss...

648
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:07,300
<font color=yellow>we all hope to experience something
that make our lives meaningful.</font>

649
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:15,200
<font color=yellow>But the sad fact is not all lives have meaning.

650
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:22,200
<font color=yellow>Some people spend their time on this planet 
just sitting on the sidelines...

651
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,600
<font color=yellow>waiting for something to happen to them...

652
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:33,000
<font color=yellow>before it's too late.

653
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
