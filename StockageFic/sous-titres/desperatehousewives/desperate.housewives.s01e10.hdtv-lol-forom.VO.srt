1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,600
<font color=yellow>Previously on "desperate housewives"...

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,300
Zach's gone from silvercrest.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,100
hungry?

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:05,900
<font color=yellow>Sometimes...

5
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,600
If I don't get some help, I will lose my mind.

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,300
Where can I score some high-grade nanny?

7
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,100
<font color=yellow>No matter how hard you try...

8
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,300
FBI. Open the door.

9
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,200
Carlos Solis, I have a warrant for your arrest.

10
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,300
<font color=yellow>Some problems...

11
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,700
I-I'm sorry. And you are?

12
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,303
I take it you've met Maisy Gibbons.

13
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:19,600
She's a total nightmare.

14
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,800
Maisy does love to rule her little kingdom.

15
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,000
You are unhappy with our sex life.

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,900
You're not getting something from me,
but you're simply too afraid to ask.

17
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,800
<font color=yellow>Can't be easily solved.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,600
<font color=yellow>To understand Maisy Gibbons,

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,000
<font color=yellow>you first need to know how she spent her afternoons.

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,500
<font color=yellow>Her mornings were spent running errands for her husband.

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,400
Hi.

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,700
<font color=yellow>Her evenings were spent washing dishes
and helping with homework.

23
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,800
Um, okay, so 9 plus 1 is...

24
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,800
<font color=yellow>but her afternoons --

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,500
<font color=yellow>well, they were spent in the company of men.

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,600
<font color=yellow>Frustrated...

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,900
<font color=yellow>misunderstood...

28
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,200
<font color=yellow>lonely men willing to pay money
to feel a little less lonely.

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,500
<font color=yellow>And Maisy Gibbons was willing to help them.

30
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,900
Maisy, I've always wondered,

31
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,500
nobody knows about your little hobby, do they?

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,900
Mnh-mnh.

33
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,000
Is it hard keeping a secret like this?

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,400
Well, maybe if it was just my secret,

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,900
but the way I see it, I keep the secrets
of every man who comes to me,

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,900
and I find that absolutely exhilarating.

37
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,800
A few years back, Harold lost his job,

38
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,000
and we had to give up our membership
at the country club.

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,700
And then one day, one of my club friends
asked why she hadn't seen me around lately,

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,800
and I told her that we couldn't afford it anymore.

41
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,600
She waved it off like it was nothing,

42
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,300
but I saw her get that look in her eye, that look of pity.

43
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,600
Maybe she was just trying to be nice.

44
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,700
Anyway, is that so bad,

45
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,500
feeling sorry for someone?

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,200
Well, when they say something,
they are being supportive,

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,400
but when they say nothing,

48
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,100
it's because they think that you're so
far gone, you're never coming back.

49
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,200
Gotcha.

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
Anyway, a couple of months later,

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,500
I started my little hobby,

52
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,900
and the most wonderful thing happened.

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,800
This woman's husband became one of my regulars.

54
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,500
Wow.

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,300
Oh.

56
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,100
Would you be a lamb and go out the back?

57
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,100
It's my next appointment.

58
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,100
Sure.

59
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,000
It's the husband of the woman
I was telling you about.

60
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,200
Hello there.

61
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,000
Hey, Maisy.

62
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,000
<font color=F62B97>Episode 10 : Come Back to Me

63
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,000
<font color=yellow>Every morality play has its cast of characters.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,500
<font color=yellow>There is always an innocent victim,

65
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,300
<font color=yellow>a deceitful villain,

66
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,000
<font color=yellow>a prosecutor who seeks the truth,

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
<font color=yellow>a magistrate who dispenses justice,

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,800
<font color=yellow>and a lawyer who charges too much.

69
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,800
<font color=yellow>This morality play was being produced
at the fairview county courthouse.

70
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,000
<font color=yellow>Its themes were trust and betrayal.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,700
So what's your issue with bail
in this case, Ms. Mcready?

72
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,900
We want bail denied, your honor.

73
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,000
The defendant's company imported goods
manufactured by slave labor,

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,500
and his business partner Mr. Tanaka
has already fled the country,

75
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,900
and Mr. Solis himself has refused
to surrender his passport.

76
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,000
Dog ate your client's passport, Mr. Hartley?

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's been temporarily misplaced, your honor,

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,700
but we maintain that Kisho Tanaka set up
and executed the entire operation.

79
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,400
Mr. Solis is no business partner,
but merely a hired contractor.

80
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,800
And I'd also like to point out that
my client is the sole provider

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,700
for his wife and his mother, who is
hospitalized in a coma as we speak.

82
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,100
Bring me the passport, and Mr. Solis
can visit his mother.

83
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,600
Until then, your client is denied bail and remanded.

84
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,300
What's next?

85
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,100
You better finish those brussels sprouts.

86
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,100
And don't think I can't see them
hidden under your macaroni.

87
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,000
I hate brussels sprouts.

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,800
Yeah, well, brussels sprouts help you grow.

89
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
You don't want to be short your whole life, do you?

90
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,000
Here, look, you know what we'll do?

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,100
We're going to dip them in a little cheese.

92
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,200
Here you go.

93
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,700
Good. Yummy. Yummy.

94
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,100
- Ew!
- Yuck!

95
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,600
Fine, fine, be 3'8" the rest of your life.

96
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
See if I care.

97
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,200
Good luck finding girlfriends.

98
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,000
Hey, didn't you have a lunch today?

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,500
I'm going to cancel it.

100
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,100
The boys are in rare form, and you're
still finding your way.

101
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,400
Lynette, it's been two days.

102
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,500
I don't want to shock them by suddenly disappearing.
You know, deep down, they're very sensitive.

103
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,900
They'll be fine.

104
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,900
Now go.

105
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,400
Get out of here.

106
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,800
You have my cell phone number.
You call me if you need anything.

107
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,000
I will.

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,700
O kay.

109
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,800
You boys, come here and give mama a 3-bear hug.

110
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:07,000
Come on. Whoo!

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,500
1, 2, 3. Whoa! Get in, get in.

112
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,100
- Mm, okay.
- Bye.

113
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,100
- Bye, mom!
- Bye.

114
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,300
Bye!

115
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,600
Okay.

116
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
Watch your hands.

117
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Um, I'm going to eat upstairs.
I've got a ton of homework.

118
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
What are you, storing up for winter?

119
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,800
I'm just really hungry.

120
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,700
Mm.

121
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,200
Oh, I talked to dad today, and apparently,
he and Brandi might break up.

122
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Oh. How awful.

123
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,000
Mom, you're smiling.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,300
Am I?

125
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,800
Anyway, because of all the drama,
he can't take me this weekend,

126
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,600
so I'll be home after all. Good night.

127
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, great. Our romantic weekend's off.

128
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,000
We could move it to my house.

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,300
No.

130
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,300
Why not?

131
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,800
I just -- I just want it to be special.

132
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,600
And it can't be special at my house.

133
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay, I know this sounds weird, but I just
need to have my things around me.

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,800
What things?

135
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,900
Perfumes and oils, and I want to pick out the
outfit that you're going to tear off me.

136
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,400
And plus, I need to be in complete
control of the lighting.

137
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,900
Okay.

138
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,500
We'll wait till next weekend.

139
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,400
You are just the sweetest guy.

140
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,700
All right. I can't wait till next weekend.

141
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,800
No, me neither.

142
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,400
What about tomorrow while Julie's at school?
I've got an early job, and that's it.

143
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,600
Oh, no good. My publisher's got me under the gun
for something. What about friday?

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,300
I'm repiping a house.

145
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,703
Mm, damn karl.

146
00:07:43,703 --> 00:07:47,607
I'm not even married to him anymore, and
he's still keeping me from having sex.

147
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,000
I can't hide you in my room forever, and...

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I think we need to tell my mom.

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,400
& nbsp;

150
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
You can trust her, I promise.

151
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,100
You didn't tell her what I told you, did you?

152
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,900
No. No, no, no. I would never tell anyone that.

153
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,300
What are you doing?

154
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,700
I don't want to cause problems for you.

155
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,500
I'm just -- I'm just going to go.

156
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,900
Zach, stop. Don't go.

157
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,500
I won't tell her.

158
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,300
I swear, I'll be out of here soon.

159
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,800
I'll think of something, okay?

160
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,100
Hello.

161
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,700
Why are you up?

162
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,700
I could ask you the same question.

163
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,900
I'm going to bed.

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,800
I didn't ask you to wait up for me.

165
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,800
Remember, I'm here as our children's
father, not your husband.

166
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,500
What are you doing?

167
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,500
Were you with a woman?

168
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,400
Did you tell her that you have a wife,
or does that hinder your pickup style?

169
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
All right.

170
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,800
Even if I was seeing someone, I have every right to.

171
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,600
Exploring options is the whole point of being separated.

172
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,800
"Options"? I'm not a mutual fund, Rex.

173
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,500
Oh, that's not --

174
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,100
Bree, you should get out there.

175
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,600
Try and meet someone.

176
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,000
Meet someone.

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,800
I'm raising your children.

178
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,900
I am just trying to move on with my life.

179
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,600
It is nothing to be ashamed of.

180
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, okay. I tell you what, then --

181
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,300
why don't you just call up your mystery
woman and invite her over?

182
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,500
I'll pull out the sofa bed, and
you can take her right there.

183
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,900
Andrew, Danielle, daddy's going to fornicate for us!

184
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,300
Just keep your voice down.

185
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,500
Why? Are you feeling ashamed?

186
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,000
<font color=yellow>The next morning started with a banging.

187
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,500
<font color=yellow>No one knew where Martha Huber was,
and Edie Britt was starting to worry.

188
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,500
<font color=yellow>Edie didn't like worrying. She felt it gave her wrinkles.

189
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:19,600
<font color=yellow>So out of concern for her face and Mrs. Huber,
Edie decided to find out what was going on.

190
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,600
Yao lin, listen to me.

191
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,500
It's very important that we find Carlos's passport.

192
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,700
I already looked through his office,
so I need you to search the bedroom.

193
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,500
What?

194
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,000
With Mr. Solis in jail, how are you
going to pay me? I have children.

195
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,200
Yao lin, your kids are in their 20s.

196
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,300
If it'll make you shut up...

197
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,300
h ere.

198
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,700
Three weeks in advance.

199
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,300
If you don't mind, can I call your bank?

200
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,300
Yao lin, don't be stupid.
People don't become poor overnight.

201
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,100
That's my car. Oh, my god.

202
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,800
Hey!

203
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,500
H ey!

204
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,900
What are you doing?

205
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,800
Where are you taking my car?

206
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,600
Government's impounding it. Here's your receipt.

207
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,000
Call that number if you have any questions.

208
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
You call this a paint job?

209
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,200
I don't want to see it again until it's perfect!

210
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,300
Wonder what's going on over there.

211
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,100
I mean, Claire did okay with the kids yesterday,
but that could have been beginner's luck.

212
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,000
You think I should call? I should call.

213
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,700
Lynette, for the first time in years,
you finally have some free time,

214
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,000
and you're wasting it obsessing about the kids.

215
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,000
It's just I don't know this woman. I mean, not really.

216
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,700
So she has a degree in sociology.
Well, big deal. Who doesn't?

217
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,600
My boys are a lot to handle.
What if she's not up to it?

218
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,000
You know, if you really have that many doubts,
you should go buy a hidden camera.

219
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,600
What, a nanny-cam?

220
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,800
Yeah.

221
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,600
People do terrible things when they
think no one's watching them.

222
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,300
Yeah.

223
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,200
& nbsp;

224
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,400
I don't really think I could videotape Claire.
It would be a breach of trust.

225
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,000
Trust is overrated.

226
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,100
So...how are things with you and Rex?

227
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,500
Fine. Why do you ask?

228
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,800
Well, I'm just curious. I mean, he moves out,
moves back in. Is he back for good?

229
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,600
Uh, the situation is, um, fluid.

230
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,400
I'm not certain what his plans are yet.

231
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,300
Huh.

232
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,000
So if you're not sure he's back for good,
why are you ironing his shirts?

233
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,000
Because I have faith that he'll come back

234
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
and that he'll do the right thing.

235
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,000
That's good.

236
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
It's good to have faith in people.

237
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,400
Yeah.

238
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,400
But I'd still buy that camera.

239
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,200
Hello?

240
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,000
- Mike?
- Yeah?

241
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
My oven's out.

242
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,800
Mm-hmm.

243
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,400
Come over and help me find my pilot light.

244
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,000
<font color=orange>Al green's "here I am (come and take me)"

245
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,800
<font color=orange>Laying all my troubles down

246
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,200
<font color=orange>here I am, baby

247
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
<font color=orange>come and take me

248
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,500
<font color=orange>here I am, baby

249
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
<font color=orange>ooh, come and take me

250
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,800
<font color=orange>take me by the hand

251
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,300
<font color=orange>ooh, yeah, show me

252
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,200
<font color=orange>here I am, baby

253
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,800
aah!

254
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,200
Oh, candles, candles.

255
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,600
<font color=orange>Here I am, baby

256
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
<font color=orange>come and take me,

257
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,000
<font color=orange>here I am, baby

258
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,700
<font color=orange>come and take me

259
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,300
<font color=orange>Take me by the hand

260
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,500
<font color=orange>here I am, baby

261
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,000
Mike, is that you?

262
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm up here.

263
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,500
<font color=orange>I can always call you

264
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,400
<font color=orange>for a helpin' hand

265
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,000
<font color=orange>I know you'll do the best you can

266
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
[Come on in...]

267
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,400
<font color=orange>but it don't take much from me

268
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,300
Mike?

269
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,500
<font color=orange>Oh, there's love inside me

270
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,400
<font color=orange>I believe there's going to be an explosion

271
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,700
<font color=orange>yeah, yeah, whoo-hoo

272
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,500
<font color=orange>it's tough for me,

273
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,400
<font color=orange>oh, yeah

274
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,500
Aah!

275
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,700
Oh, my god.

276
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,300
What the hell?

277
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm so sorry. I thought there was someone in the house.

278
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,400
So you took your clothes off?

279
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,200
No, my clothes were already off.
I was going to seduce you.

280
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,400
It didn't really work.

281
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,800
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

282
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,700
Well...

283
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,400
please don't be mad.

284
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,400
hey there.

285
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,100
Zach.

286
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,000
What are you doing here?

287
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,700
<font color=yellow>Later that day, while Claire was out
getting the boys wired on ice cream,

288
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,600
<font color=yellow>Lynette did some wiring of her own.

289
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,900
No, you can't do this. You can't send Zach back.

290
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,800
Julie, what else can I do? He can't stay here.

291
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,300
His father sent him to a psycho ward.

292
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,800
Actually, they call it a rehabilitation center.

293
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,600
What do you think?

294
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,900
Paul is his father. He has a right
to know his son's okay.

295
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,400
And if he finds out you're hiding him,
you could get in a lot of trouble.

296
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,600
He's right.

297
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,100
Sorry, guys.

298
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,400
Mom, please don't do this.

299
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,100
If you knew what Zach had been through --

300
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,800
Julie, Julie, it's okay. I'll be fine.

301
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,200
I'll, uh, take him back over so you two can...

302
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,300
listen, if Paul sees Zach and freaks out --

303
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,000
I'll bring him right back.

304
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,300
Thank you.

305
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,600
Young lady, we need to talk about what you did.

306
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,500
I really don't feel like talking to you right now.

307
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,400
Uh, listen, Zach...

308
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,300
if things ever get really bad...

309
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,700
it's got my cell number on it.

310
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,700
You give me a call... anytime.

311
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,700
Thanks.

312
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,100
Oh, thank god.

313
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,600
How did you --

314
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,200
we'll talk later.

315
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Remember, anytime.

316
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,500
I heard you moved back home.

317
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,800
Yeah, I-I had to. We -- we had some
problems with Andrew.

318
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,300
I'll move out eventually.

319
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,100
Spikes or pearls?

320
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,500
Your choice.

321
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,800
You know what I think?

322
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,900
Hmm?

323
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,900
You don't really want to leave her.

324
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,300
Please don't psycho analyze me.

325
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,400
Well, you're still in love with her.

326
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,700
I never said I wasn't.

327
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,500
Then why divorce?

328
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,600
Now you're rooting for us two crazy kids to work it out?

329
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,900
Hey

330
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,000
You know me.

331
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,600
I'm just a romantic at heart.

332
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,500
Scarves or cuffs?

333
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,200
Up to you.

334
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,700
Even if I could find a way to deal with Bree's
whole obsessive-compulsive thing,

335
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,500
it's not the only problem in our marriage.

336
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,600
As you know, I have certain needs.

337
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,600
Boots or stilettos?

338
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,000
Stilettos... please.

339
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,500
Why don't you just tell Bree what you need?

340
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,700
Tell her what you want.

341
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
Because she'd say no.

342
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,000
So? I've said no to some things
you've asked me to do.

343
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,600
Yeah, that's different.

344
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,600
I don't care if you reject me.

345
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,000
Rex...

346
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,200
do you trust me on this?

347
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,600
Sometimes when you love somebody,

348
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,600
you've just got to make sacrifices for them.

349
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,600
Love or passion --

350
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,800
it's an awful choice to make.

351
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,700
Yes, it is.

352
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,400
Now, I have to warn you --

353
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,200
this might hurt a little bit.

354
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,400
Aah!

355
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,600
How am I supposed to live without a car?

356
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,200
Okay, Gabrielle, listen. Tanaka's still at large,
and they're going to want Carlos to flip on him,

357
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
so this is their way of playing hardball.

358
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,000
Now, I'm guessing that they're not done yet.

359
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Why?

360
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,800
What else could they take from us?

361
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,400
Pretty much anything.

362
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,000
It's all fair game if they even think
they can trace it to ill-gotten gains.

363
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,500
No, no, no. No, some of this stuff is mine
when I modeled, before I even met Carlos.

364
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,100
See this?

365
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,200
Kosta boda. Bought it when I landed my first cover.

366
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,300
This -- I spent eight hours on a rock
in a bikini for that painting.

367
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,300
I understand how you feel --

368
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,800
no, you don't understand.

369
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,000
I have dug myself up from dirt to afford these things,

370
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,400
and no one is going to take them away from me.

371
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,600
Then I suggest you find yourself a good hiding place.

372
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,500
They can't take what they can't find.

373
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,900
Oh, and if you can scare up that
passport, too, that would be good.

374
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,700
- Oh, hi, Gabrielle.
- Hi.

375
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,900
What have you got there?

376
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,800
My china. I know how you've always loved it, and
I thought you might want to borrow it for a while.

377
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Oh. Well, that's, um, very thoughtful of you.

378
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,000
Say, um, can I store some odds
and ends in your garage?

379
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,300
Sure. Why don't you, uh, come by tomorrow?

380
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,000
Sooner is better than later, right?

381
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,600
Oh.

382
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Oh.

383
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,000
Mm.

384
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,300
Aah.

385
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,800
Just like...

386
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,700
Come on now.

387
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,000
Yes! Ah.

388
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,600
Rex?

389
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,400
Rex?

390
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,500
Rex?!

391
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,400
I need an ambulance. Right away.

392
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,600
Oh.

393
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,700
Hello?

394
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,800
Yes, this is she.

395
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,000
Yes, he's my husband.

396
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,400
Um, excuse me. I'm here to see Rex Van De Kamp.
Apparently, he had a heart attack.

397
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,300
I'm not sure --

398
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,100
he's being prepped for surgery right now.
If you'd like to wait...

399
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,800
could I at least poke my head in? I'm his wife.

400
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,000
You're his wife?

401
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,700
Yes. Why?

402
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,000
I was thinking of a different patient.

403
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,200
Let me get the doctor.

404
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,300
[Rex Van De Kamp]

405
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,800
[Maisy Gibbons]

406
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,800
<font color=yellow>As Claire prepared for bed, she was unaware
that somewhere else in the Scavo house,

407
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,000
<font color=yellow>the day she had just finished
was starting all over again.

408
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,100
The dog is blue, the doggie is blue

409
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,700
<font color=yellow>Lynette was relieved to see
that Claire was doing a good job.

410
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,800
<font color=yellow>But after further viewing...

411
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,100
come give me a 3-bear hug.

412
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,600
<font color=yellow>It dawned on Lynette...

413
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,600
<font color=yellow>Claire might be doing her job a little too well.

414
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,700
Here's the candles I borrowed.

415
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,500
Thanks.

416
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,400
I'm trying to read, so if you don't mind...

417
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,200
I cannot believe, after everything
you did, you're mad at me.

418
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,200
I told Zach that he could trust you,
and you turned him in.

419
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Yeah, well, someone had to be responsible,
and like it or not,

420
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,000
I've got a birth certificate that says I'm your mother.

421
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,300
Since when?

422
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,600
What is that supposed to mean?

423
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,900
Since dad left, if there's been a mother
around here, it's been me.

424
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,600
Julie.

425
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,600
Do you remember after the divorce that you stayed in bed
for a week and I had to beg you to eat something?

426
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,500
Yeah, but --

427
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,000
and for weeks, I had to clean the house,
I had to make sure that the bills were paid.

428
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,100
I even had to schedule my own
doctor's appointment once.

429
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,500
I was in bad shape back then.

430
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,200
It's still going on.

431
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,100
And now that I need some support,
you decide to play the mom card?

432
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,300
I had to send Zach back.

433
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,400
We could have gotten in a lot of trouble.

434
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,400
Yeah, well, now Zach's the one who's in trouble.

435
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,000
You sent him back to a man who hates him.

436
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,500
<font color=yellow>As gabrielle considered the vast emptiness
of her new surroundings,

437
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:36,600
<font color=yellow>she was surprised to find there was only
one thing she truly missed --

438
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,600
<font color=yellow>her husband.

439
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,400
Mrs. Solis, we have a warrant to enter your house

440
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,600
and repossess any goods which we suspect
may have been obtained...illegally.

441
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,900
We're not into clutter.

442
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,500
All right,"harvey the flying turtle." Doesn't this look fun.

443
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,600
Where's Claire?

444
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,300
I gave her the afternoon off.

445
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,400
Who wants to turn pages?

446
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Is she sick?

447
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,700
No, she's fine. I just wanted us all
to spend the day together, you know?

448
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,000
Like we used to. Here we go.

449
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,400
"Once upon a time, there was a young turtle named harvey.

450
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,800
"Every day, harvey would tell all the other turtles,

451
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,000
"'one day, I'm going to fly off this island
"and go see the world.

452
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,100
'The other turtles laughed
and said,'turtles can't fly.'"

453
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,800
Ooh, it's getting good now, huh?

454
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,500
W-what's wrong?

455
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,200
When Claire reads, she does funny voices.

456
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,500
Does she, now?

457
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,600
Okay.

458
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,200
"Harvey didn't like the turtles laughing, "so he told them,

459
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,500
'I'll show you. One day I will fly higher than the birds.'"

460
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,800
That's not funny.

461
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,300
Yeah? Well, I'm just warming up.

462
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:04,200
"Then bruno, the big, bad turtle, "took harvey up on
the cliff and threw him over, "and he proclaimed,

463
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:10,200
"'we'll see if you can fly.
Fly or die, fly or die.'"

464
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,500
When's Claire coming back?

465
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,200
What happened to your nails?

466
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,200
Oh, I -- I moved all our stuff to keep it from the feds.

467
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,100
It kills me that I'm putting you through this.

468
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,700
Hands on the table.

469
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,300
It's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong.

470
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,500
I'll take care of everything
until you're back to do it yourself.

471
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,500
And you will be soon.

472
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,900
I got to be honest, I didn't know
how you would hold up.

473
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,200
I knew you were a strong woman, but I had no idea.

474
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,800
You're a good wife, gabby,

475
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,500
a real partner.

476
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,500
Oh, Carlos, I love you so much.

477
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,300
I would give up that house full of expensive junk
just to put this behind us

478
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,500
and have you home with me.

479
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,800
That sounds pretty good right now.

480
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,100
I'm going to kiss my husband now.

481
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,100
Hands on the table.

482
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,300
There's a false panel on the back wall of my closet.

483
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,000
My passport is there, along with some papers.

484
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,800
Take the passport to the lawyer and burn the papers.

485
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,200
Carlos, did you know what Tanaka was doing?

486
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,800
Just burn... the papers.

487
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,300
Hey, Lynette.

488
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,800
Did Martha Huber happen to leave
a spare key to her house with you?

489
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
No.

490
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,000
Oh.

491
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,200
Where is she, by the way? I haven't seen her in days.

492
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,500
Got me.

493
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,600
She kicked me out so fast that I forgot my laptop,

494
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,600
and there's just some stuff on there
that I don't want anyone else to see.

495
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,900
Oh. Well... good luck with that.

496
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,800
You know, you're not looking half bad.

497
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,700
What have you done with that little posse of yours?

498
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,000
They're with the new nanny.

499
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,100
Wow, your own personal nanny? Smell you.

500
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,100
Well, trust me, it's not all it's cracked up to be.

501
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,200
You know, our mothers were smart.

502
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,500
They didn't get us nannies or put us in day care
because they knew if they did, we'd find out

503
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,200
there are other women out there
who are better mothers than they were.

504
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,500
You know, I had a nanny for a while
growing up -- Mrs. Muntz.

505
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,000
You had a nanny?

506
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,300
Well, actually, she was more like a
court-appointed social worker.

507
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,900
My mom did a little time.

508
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,700
She had a thing for bourbon and shoplifting.

509
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,000
Oh. Sorry.

510
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,700
Oh, Muntz was a hard-ass --no mercy.

511
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,700
In fact, she was such a disciplinarian
that when my mom made parole,

512
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,100
I was actually happy to see her.

513
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,000
Really?

514
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,400
Yeah.

515
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,000
Lesser of two evils.

516
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,800
Huh.

517
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,500
Anyway, I got to find a key.

518
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,800
- See you later.
- Bye.

519
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,400
Thanks for your help with Zach before.

520
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,200
Oh, it's my pleasure.

521
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,900
I hope he comes out of this okay.

522
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,400
He's a little squirrelly, but seems like a good kid.

523
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,600
Yeah.

524
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,200
So how's Julie taking all this?

525
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,800
Not well.

526
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,800
She accused me of not being a good mother.

527
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,600
Oh, you're a great mom.

528
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,600
Well, she was sort of right.

529
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,400
After my divorce, I really leaned on her a lot.

530
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,100
Seems natural.

531
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,500
And I still kind of do it.

532
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:22,300
I just want somebody to talk to about all
my adult stuff, and she's right there,

533
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,700
and she just acts so mature. I forget she's 13.

534
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,400
Well, the good news is that from now on,

535
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,900
if you ever want to talk to somebody
about grown-up stuff, you got me.

536
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,400
Well, I can't talk to you about everything.

537
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,700
Oh.

538
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:51,500
What if I want to talk about the big crush I have
on the plumber that lives across the street?

539
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,800
Big crush, huh?

540
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,100
Oh, yeah.

541
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,500
Wow, you'd have to tell me more.

542
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:04,000
Well, um... he's got a smile that's to die for,

543
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,100
and don't get me started on his tattoo.

544
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,400
Thanks.

545
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,700
Oh, Bree.

546
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,400
What a-a nice surprise.

547
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,800
Would you like to come in?

548
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,400
Well, that depends.

549
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,500
Are you having an affair with my husband?

550
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,100
Would you like some more potatoes?

551
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,300
You already asked me that.

552
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,500
Sorry.

553
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,300
I'm so relieved you're safe, I'm, uh...

554
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,900
I'm not thinking straight.

555
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,900
Does that mean you're not going to
send me back to silvercrest?

556
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,100
You've got to understand,

557
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,900
your behavior, the violence,
breaking into the Van De Kamps' --

558
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,500
I just didn't know what you were going through.

559
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,700
You could have asked me.

560
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,300
Well...

561
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,100
I've been remembering things...

562
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,500
things from when I was little.

563
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,000
What kind of things?

564
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,400
Awful things.

565
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,200
Zach, listen to me.

566
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,000
Sometimes it's not good to look back on the past.

567
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,600
But I can't help it.

568
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,300
These images just keep popping into my head.

569
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,300
Well, then, you've got to find a way
to push them back out again.

570
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,900
Okay.

571
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,500
More potatoes?

572
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,300
Yes, please.

573
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,600
Sure is nice to be back to normal.

574
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:17,300
You should know that Rex still loves you...

575
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,300
very much.

576
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,500
He said that?

577
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,400
Yes.

578
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,700
Then why is he so unhappy?

579
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,200
He has certain needs, and he's afraid
to discuss them with you.

580
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,400
Needs -- like...

581
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,200
sexual needs?

582
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,100
Yes.

583
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,200
And have you fulfilled those needs?

584
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,900
I see.

585
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,900
You know, you are pretty brazen for a woman

586
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,800
who just admitted, however tacitly,
that she just slept with my husband.

587
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,300
If I told anyone in this neighborhood,
they would never speak to you again.

588
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,600
You're not going to tell a soul.

589
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,900
Yeah, you may hate me, but you'd hate
the humiliation a lot more.

590
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,100
Oh, I don't hate you, Maisy.

591
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,300
I pity you.

592
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,000
Hi.

593
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,800
Oh, hey, Lynette. Are you heading out now?

594
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,000
Yep.

595
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,600
Um, I'll be home late, so just the usual routine --
a nap for penny, and --

596
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,300
I know, no sugar after 5:00. I got it.

597
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,900
You're the best.

598
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,100
Oh, one more thing.

599
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,900
Since the boys are having corn dogs for dinner,

600
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,000
I'd like you to make sure they
get a vegetable to go with it.

601
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,700
Brussels sprouts?

602
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,500
They're full of iron.

603
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,400
Would you make sure they clean their plates?

604
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,600
Not a problem.

605
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,000
I have this little trick I do.
I cover the veggies with some cheese.

606
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,500
Ooh, you sly dog.

607
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:18,200
<font color=yellow>That night, Lynette settled in to watch her personal
pick for feel-good movie of the year.

608
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,500
You guys, you need to eat your brussels sprouts.

609
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,700
Brussels sprouts!

610
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,300
I don't want this!

611
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,800
Hey! Yes, you do!

612
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,200
You guys, don't throw them -- hey!

613
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,800
Hey, stop it!

614
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,600
Do not -- ow! Hey! You guys, stop it!

615
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,900
Do not throw these at me, you guys! Cut it out!

616
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,700
Hey.

617
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,200
Hey.

618
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,000
I guess they operated, huh?

619
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,500
They sure did.

620
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,000
How' d it go?

621
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,300
It went well.

622
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,500
The surgeon says you're going to be as good as new.

623
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,300
You look like you've been crying.

624
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,600
I have.

625
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,700
I was so afraid you were going to die.

626
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,600
There's so many things I haven't had
a chance to tell you.

627
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,600
I'm sorry you were so worried.

628
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,500
It's okay.

629
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,000
How are you now, Rex?

630
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,300
Are you strong enough to listen to
the things I need to tell you?

631
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,300
Sure, hon.

632
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,600
I know you still love me.

633
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,700
Maisy told me.

634
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,800
She did?

635
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,000
As of this moment, Rex,

636
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I am no longer your wife.

637
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,400
I am going to go out and find the most vindictive lawyer
can find, and together, we are going to eviscerate you.

638
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,200
I am going to take away your money,

639

640
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,800

00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,900
Do you hear me?

Bree --

643
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:53,800

to hurt as much as is humanly possible.

646
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,800
I'm so glad you didn't die before
I got a chance to tell you that.
