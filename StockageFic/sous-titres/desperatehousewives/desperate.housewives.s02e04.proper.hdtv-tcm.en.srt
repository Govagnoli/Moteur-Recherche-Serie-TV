00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Previously on "desperate housewives"...

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,170
you're not taking me?Dad's gonna take you.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,350
Lynette's new job came with a price.

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,340
If this charge sticks,I get sent awayfor eight years.

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,620
And carlos paid for his mistakes.

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,210
Are you in lovewith mr. Williams?

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,040
No.

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,980
I think the machinepicked up on something

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,230
that I wasn't aware of.

10
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,890
While bree detected feelings

11
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,690
she'd never known.

12
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,740
You come within 10 feet of her,I will have you arrested.

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,970
Now get out. Susan discovered something...

14
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,880
zach is your son,isn't he?

15
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,450
Too close to home.

16
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,520
The residents of the fairview county jail

17
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,910
looked forward to every tuesday.

18
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,100
That was the day that gabrielle solis

19
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,170
came to visit her husband.

20
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,510
The inmates went out of their way to give her compliments

21
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,270
whether she wanted them to or not.

22
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,410
With each visit,these accolades became

23
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,960
increasingly inventive.

24
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,310
Still,gabrielle was not flattered.

25
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,950
In fact,gabrielle started to dread this special attention.

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,220
Until one day,when...

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,150
I don't think a conjugal visitis such a ridiculous request.

28
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,630
With all due respect,mrs. Solis,

29
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,950
let's just get throughthe discovery phase first,okay?

30
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,310
But I don't thinkI can wait that long.

31
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,770
I am trying to get your husbandout of jail.

32
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,260
Do you want me to juststop everything

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,750
so you can havea booty call?

34
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,960
Excuse me,we are husband and wife.

35
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,510
We make love.It is a very sacred covenant.

36
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,280
Okay,look,all we need is 20 minutes.

37
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,430
I said no.You can't tell me no.

38
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,770
You work for me.

39
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,240
You will make it happen.

40
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,110
You can't force meto do anything.

41
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,200
I am not your maidor your gardener.

42
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,560
Whoa!Oh!

43
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,760
I can have youarrested for that.

44
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,010
Oh,really?And how about for this?

45
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,520
Ow!

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,810
You crazy bitch!

47
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,840
Ow!

48
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,000
Hey,apologize to the lady.

49
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,390
Big mistake,pal.I play golf with the warden.

50
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,300
You're gonna rot--

51
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,050
You heard him.Apologize.

52
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,770
Look,fellas,

53
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,530
I am just trying to do my job.This is all her fault!

54
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,220
If she weren't so damn horny--ow!

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,360
All right! All right!

56
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,930
come on!

57
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,710
It was at that moment it occurred to gabrielle...

58
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,870
apologize!

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,020
This was the nicest compliment she had ever received.

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,880
There was one thing all the fathers on wisteria lane had in common--

64
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,520
they could return home from a hard day's work to the family they'd left behind

65
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,510
and not feel at all guilty about the precious moments they had missed.

66
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,930
Sadly,the same could not be said for the working mothers.

67
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,640
Hey,honey,I held dinner for as long as I could.

68
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,540
It just got...

69
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,140
too late for them.

70
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,220
You couldn't have given 'em coffee or something?

71
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,960
I just feel like I'm missing out on their lives entirely.

72
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,420
Hey,you sit,eat,and I will fill you in.

73
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,910
Oh,don't eat that. That's been sitting out for hours.

74
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,500
That's for mrs. Mulberry.

75
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,430
This...

76
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,090
is for you.

77
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,710
I'm sorry. Who?

78
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,830
Oh,mrs. Mulberry.

79
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,710
Parker has an imaginary friend.

80
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,610
Um,british nanny.

81
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,490
I think he really locked into the whole "mary poppins" thing.

82
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,260
Is that why he's sleeping with an umbrella?

83
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,740
He carries it with him everywhere.

84
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,340
It's a security blanket.

85
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,260
When did this start?

86
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,730
About a week ago,I guess.

87
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,410
And you don't find it odd that parker's new nanny

88
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,040
made her appearance right at the time I went back to work?

89
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,460
Kids have imaginary friends.

90
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,330
It's no big deal.

91
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,640
I'll agree with you to a point,

92
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,970
when they're flying kangaroos or giant robots,

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,950
not surrogate mommies.

94
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,200
Hey...

95
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,650
parker is having a little trouble adjusting.

96
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,960
That's all.

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,740
Apparently,so are you.

98
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,370
Honey,don't be so sensitive.

99
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,190
I hope you're right.

100
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,840
At the risk of sounding too sensitive,

101
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,560
how come she gets a bigger portion?

102
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,390
That's it?

103
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,080
You're the one who said you wanted things to be casual between us.

104
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,620
Yeah,

105
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,430
but that doesn't mean we have to act like brother and sister.

106
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,230
I mean,you bought me ribs.I have gratitude to express.

107
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,670
What's wrong?

108
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,740
I can't do this.

109
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,190
This casual thing--

110
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,560
it's--it's weird.

111
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,000
No! No! It's not.

112
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,660
We're just gonna pretend like it was when we first started dating.

113
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,550
We just see each other occasionally,

114
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,600
you know,until we get the zach thing resolved.

115
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,480
Yeah,well,we'll just be easy about it. No commitments.

116
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,460
Except,of course,

117
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,330
neither of us is allowed to date anybody else.

118
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,360
Look,I...

119
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,570
I know how you feel about zach.

120
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,890
And,look,

121
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,380
I don't blame you.

122
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,910
But he's part of the package right now,

123
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,080
and either you can accept that or you can'T.

124
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,730
Well,anyway...

125
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,540
mike,wait!

126
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,080
I accept.

127
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,530
Are you sure?

128
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,180
Zach's your son.

129
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,270
And I have julie,

130
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,080
and you've totally accepted her.

131
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,350
I mean,granted,she's been the model child so far.

132
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,540
But she's almost 15. She's going to turn on me any minute.

133
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,710
And you better be there to help me when it gets ugly.

134
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,590
I will.

135
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,030
Good night.

136
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,720
- Uh,susan?
- Yeah?

137
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,980
Technically,we don't have to be casual anymore.

138
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,900
I can be naked in 20 seconds.

139
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,790
That includes travel time.

140
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,300
Carlos,will you calm down?

141
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,260
You incited a prison riot.

142
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,250
It wasn't a riot.

143
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,960
It was more of a melee.

144
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,200
Who's going to defend me now?

145
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,200
Doyle knew my case.

146
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,270
He knew the judge.He called me a bitch.

147
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,070
Well,were you actinglike one?

148
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,440
He refused to help meget a conjugal visit.

149
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,790
Hold it.

150
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,610
My lawyer's in tractionbecause you wanted sex?

151
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,600
Not just for me,for us.

152
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,330
In case you haven't noticed,carlos,

153
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,900
our marriage is stillon shaky ground.

154
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,710
And you thought a conjugal visit would fix it?It couldn't hurt.

155
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,520
Ever since you've been in here,all we do is bicker.

156
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,320
That's all we ever did whenI was out. That's what we do!

157
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,900
Yeah,but whenwe would finish arguing,

158
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,140
we would have this great sex.Now all we do is fight,

159
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,680
and there's no payoff,and it sucks!

160
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,440
You and I needto get laid!

161
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,850
Oh,don't judge me.

162
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,240
You're not in here becauseyou got caught helping the poor.

163
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,960
See,we'd be enjoyingthis argument more

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,450
if we had somethingto look forward to.

165
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,560
Fine. Get the damn lawyer.

166
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,360
And make it quick.

167
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,430
I take it that wasmy good night kiss.

168
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,360
George,you're a very special friend.

169
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,650
You are,but rexhasn't been dead four weeks,

170
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,250
so I think kissingon the lips is--

171
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,600
further thanyou want to go.

172
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,750
Exactly.I hope you don't mind.

173
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,930
Andrew,what are you doing?

174
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,200
Taking out the garbage.

175
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,610
Of course.You remember mr. Williams.

176
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,140
Hi,andrew.

177
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,960
George.

178
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,680
Uh,well,it's getting late,so...

179
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,110
yeah. So let me know if you wantto go out to dinner again soon.

180
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,320
There's a couple new restaurantsI'd like to try.

181
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,230
You know,we've been eating outa lot lately.

182
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,220
Why don't you come over fridayfor a home-cooked meal?

183
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,400
Wouldn't that be nice?Oh,I would love that.

184
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,070
So you leavingor what?

185
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,680
We're not donetalking.

186
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,070
She saidit was getting late.

187
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,990
In case you missed that,that was a hint.

188
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,380
Andrew...

189
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,350
that wasn't a hint.

190
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,690
I'll gowhen I'm ready.

191
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,030
Actually,it is getting late,and I am tired so...

192
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,410
see? You heard the lady.Now...

193
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,360
take off.

194
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,360
Andrew.

195
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,760
It's okay.He's not really that tough.

196
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,130
He knows I would neverhit a child.

197
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,220
Andrew!

198
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,100
George!

199
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,380
Stop it,the two of you,this instant!

200
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,790
This wasa perfectly lovely evening,

201
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,340
and now the both of youhave ruined it.

202
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,540
I will not toleratethis kind of behavior.

203
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,570
Do you understand?

204
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,800
All right,then.

205
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,910
George,we'll see you fridayfor dinner.

206
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,770
I'll be serving fish.

207
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,790
Hey,buddy.

208
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,690
Hey,wake up,sleepyhead.Parker.

209
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,200
Hi. Hiya,pal.

210
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,380

212
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,640
before mommyhas to go to work?

213
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,680
Yeah? Come on.Come on. Come on. Come on.

214
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,230
All right. Oh.

215
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,990
So what do you thinkyou're gonna have,huh? Jelly?

216
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,060
'Cause I thinkI'm gonna have a bear claw.

217
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,580
Stop!

218
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,360
I forgot mrs. Mulberry.

219
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,540
What?

220
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,390
Oh,um,well,since I'm here,

221
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,490
maybe she could just relaxin the house for awhile,okay?

222
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,080
No,I need her!

223
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,030
Okay.

224
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,820
Hello,mrs. Mulberry.

225
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,900
Don't forget to buckle up.

226
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,450
Here we go.

227
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,900
Wait!

228
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,000
You forgot her umbrella.

229
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,990
Well,parker,we don't have time.

230
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,450
No!

231
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,120
she needs it.

232
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:19,940
Hi.

233
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,320
Hey,what are youstill doing here?

234
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,330
I'm lookingfor parker's umbrella.

235
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,210
Have you seen it?No. Nope. Sorry.

236
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,470
Hey,honey,you better hurry.

237
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,710
You're gonna be late for work.

238
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,780
Thank you for that.

239
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,780
I couldn't findmrs. Mulberry's umbrella,

240
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,420
so I brought herher sun hat instead,

241
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,570
all right?

242
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,130
And here we go.It's in the shower.

243
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:49,990
What?

244
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,430
Mrs. Mulberry saysshe left it in the shower.

245
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,410
Well,why didn'tmrs. Mulberry

246
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,790
volunteer that information

247
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,040
before I turned your roomupside down

248
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,730
looking for it,hmm?

249
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,880
Are you going to go get it?

250
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,280
No,I'm not gonna getthe damn umbrella!

251
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,960
I'm so sorry,sweetie.I am not mad at you.

252
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,120
What are you doing?

253
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,290
Uh...

254
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,680
we don't want doughnuts.

255
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,620
Ahem.

256
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:38,130
Andrew,you are notleaving the house dressed like that.

257
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,190
I'm just going to meetsome of the guys at the swim club.

258
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,430
I don't care.Put this on.

259
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,120
Every timeyou leave this house,

260
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,250
you represent this family,

261
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:50,410
and the least you can dois not humiliate us.

262
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,130
A ripped t-shirtis just a look.

263
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,050
Yes,a bad one.

264
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,910
I hope you haven't made plansfor tomorrow night.

265
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,110
Look,if you thinkI'm having dinner

266
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,540
with the pharmacist,you're crazy.

267
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,140
Part of the reasonI'm having him over

268
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,710
is so that youcan get to know him.

269
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,330
Yeah,well,I don't wantto get to know him.

270
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,810
Honey,the feelingsthat you're having

271
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,780
are perfectly normal.

272
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,360
But george isn't tryingto take your father's place.

273
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,270
He's--well,he's just a friend.

274
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,700
Really? Just a friend?

275
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,310
So you're not planningon getting more serious

276
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,340
with this guyin the future?

277
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,830
You know,I haven't eventhought about it.

278
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,270
You're so transparent,it's pathetic.

279
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,030
You're worried abouta ripped t-shirt

280
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,030
humiliating this family?

281
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,530
Wait till people see thatyou're dating the town nerd

282
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,530
less than a month afteryour husband's funeral.

283
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,530
I'll be serving dinnertomorrow night at 7.

284
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,540
Please don't be late.

285
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,320
I'm sorry,but I already have plans.

286
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,080
Andrew,don't you havea meet at the swim club?

287
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,890
Yeah,so?

288
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,790
Doesn't it requirea large entrance fee,

289
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,570
one that you can't affordby yourself?

290
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,190
Are you blackmailing meinto coming to dinner?

291
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,310
Oh,you don't knowthe lengths I'd go to for even seating.

292
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,900
Mayer,is this yours?

293
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,360
Blew into my front yard.

294
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,470
Oh,sorry.I'm helping mike find zach.

295
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,360
You know,so we can allrest easy at night.

296
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,770
Uh-huh.And put him in jail?

297
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:25,370
I don't think mike

298
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,260
would do thatto his own son.

299
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,180
You know?

300
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,370
That mike's zach'sreal father? Yes.

301
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,940
Oh. Julie told karl,karl told me,

302
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,670
and I,well,sent outa few e-mails.

303
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,520
Well,thanksfor your discretion.

304
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,780
Boy,you would do anything to get mike delfinoto love you.

305
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,260
So what's gonna happento little creepy when he gets here?

306
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,570
Are you gonna betucking him in at night?

307
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,930
Making him breakfastin the morning?

308
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,180
Careful to bob and weave as hetries to blow your head off?

309
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,520
You know,edie,could you just back off?

310
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,080
I mean,the truth is,we're probably nevergonna find zach anyway.

311
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,720
It's a needle in a haystack.

312
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,930
Oh,I see.

313
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,490
And then you'll still come offas little miss perfect,self-sacrificing girlfriend,

314
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,320
putting his needs

315
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,560
ahead of yours.

316
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,360
Oh,why,you connivinglittle shrew.

317
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,230
I don't know whywe're not closer.

318
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,820
There was a reason david bradley

319
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:35,750
was the most successful lawyer in all of fairview.

320
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,100
His arguments were persuasive...

321
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,410
no one ever has to know.

322
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,340
His manner was forceful...

323
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,750
take it off.Take it off.

324
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,350
And he tended to win on appeal.

325
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,330
Please.

326
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,260
And when it came to the more challenging cases,

327
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,920
he knew it was to his advantage

328
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,460
to raise the first objection.

329
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,870
I'm not gonna takeyour case.

330
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,440
What?

331
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,090
yes.

332
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,370
sorry to interrupt,mr. Bradley.

333
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,840
Your dinner just canceled.Want me to pull the reservation?

334
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,850
No,I still have to eat.I'm sorry,where were we?

335
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,200
You were about to turn me down,and then you reconsidered

336
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,160
once you realized I was gonnathrow a ton of money at you,

337
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,170
which I am.

338
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:27,420
Ah. It's not about the moneyfor me anymore,mrs. Solis.

339
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,730
The fact is,if I don't feelpassionately about a client,

340
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,360
if I don't feelthat fire in my belly,

341
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,530
I don't bringmy a-game to court,

342
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,000
and from what I've read,it'll take my a-gameto save your husband.

343
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,620
Is this aboutthe gay bashing thing?

344
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,100
He's innocent.

345
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,010
He went berserkand attacked a man in court.

346
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,670
Yeah,but that wasa jealousy thing.

347
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,670
The man that my husbandwas trying to kill in court

348
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,460
is not the least bit gay,trust me.

349
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,650
Your file also saysyou're seeking conjugal visits.

350
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,060
Trying to keepthe old marriage alive,huh?

351
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:58,350
Why does everybodyhave a problem with me having sexwith my husband?

352
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,460
Can I be frank?

353
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,150
Only if it ends with megetting what I want.

354
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,900
Your marriage is doomed.

355
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,710
Excuse me?

356
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,910
I've been doing thisfor a long time,mrs. Solis.

357
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,790
I know what incarcerationcan do to a relationship.

358
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,440
Marriage is hard enough,

359
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,560
but when you throw incement walls,

360
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,980
armed guards,iron bars,

361
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,910
it tends to go downhillrather quickly.

362
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,780
Conjugal visitsnotwithstanding.

363
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,220
But I--

364
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,520
listen,you want my advice?

365
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,540
Walk away.

366
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,210
You're young.

367
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,280
You made a mistake.You learn from it.

368
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,480
Maybe next timeyou'll marry smarter.

369
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,250
Now if you'll excuse me,I have dinner reservations.

370
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,670
Reservation.

371
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,690
You're eating alone,remember?

372
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,800
And I have a feelingit's not the first time.

373
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,720
I'm so sorryI couldn't get here sooner.

374
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,490
I forgot my husbandhad to take our youngest

375
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,750
to the pediatricianand...

376
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,070
it's all right,mrs. Scavo.

377
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,190
So...what did parker do?

378
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,180
Are you aware that your sonhas an imaginary friend,

379
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,510
a mrs. Mulberry?

380
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,950
Yes. We've met.

381
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,870
Well,um,yesterday,

382
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
parker demanded that

383
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,020
mrs. Mulberry get her own easelduring art,which was fine.

384
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,410
But today it was a desk.

385
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,010
And unfortunately,we didn't have an extra desk.

386
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,490
Oh.

387
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,570
That must have been ugly.

388
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,150
It was.

389
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,700
Patty was rammed

390
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,970
with this.

391
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,190
Oh. I am so sorry.

392
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,340
Mrs. Scavo,

393
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,640
have you experienceda death in your family recently?

394
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,360
No. No. Why?

395
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Imaginary friends are oftencreated as a coping mechanism

396
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,430
to--to deal with loss.

397
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,030
Uh-huh.

398
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,980
Or it might occur as the resultof some major change

399
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,090
or extensive alterationin their lives.

400
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:00,790
Exactly.

401
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,050
A manifestation ofsome deep-seated unhappiness.

402
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
Can you think of anything

403
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,530
that might sheda little bit of light

404
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,670
on this for us?

405
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,460
Mrs. Scavo?

406
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,880
thank you.

407
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,070
And I'm thinking,it's the golden gate bridge.

408
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,610
What a great place to geta picture of the sunset.

409
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,390
So I lean out way over the rail to get the shot.

410
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,720
Next thing I know,the police arrive.

411
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,320
People had called 9-1-1from their cell phones.

412
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,380
Thought I was suicidal.

413
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,500
I can't believe how wellthose two are getting along.

414
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,940
Yeah,it's freaky.

415
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,000
Andrew is beingpolite and engaging.

416
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,680
He's even laughingat george's jokes.

417
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,690
That's whyit's freaky.

418
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,690
George's jokesaren't funny.

419
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,240
so,george,can I ask you a question?

420
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,430
And it's kind of personal.

421
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,850
Sure.

422
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,970
Have you ever actuallybeen with a woman?

423
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,950
Excuse me?

424
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,580
Well,let's be honest.I think it's obvious

425
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,990
by the waythat you talk and act

426
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,090
that you're not a player,

427
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,260
so I was just curiousto find out

428
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,040
if you had ever actuallygotten in the game.

429
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,990
My experience with womenis none of your business.

430
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,140
Oh,I think it is.

431
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,730
I mean,you're dating my mom.

432
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,400
And we both knowthat at your age,

433
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,400
dating's a little morethan just holding hands.

434
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,020
We're not dating exactly.

435
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,700
Oh,sure you are.

436
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,440
And you know what?I think it's great.

437
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,530
But I wanna make suremy mom's happy,

438
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,530
you know,and it wouldreally set my mind at ease

439
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,980
to know that she's with a guythat knows how to please a lady.

440
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,840
This is inappropriate.

441
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,860
You know,my parentshad a great sex life.

442
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,890
Man,I heard 'em throughthe wall of my bedroom once.

443
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,460
Please shut up.

444
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,710
You should've heardmy mom,too.

445
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,850
She had this--this weird moan.

446
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:18,010
It was kind of like,um... mmm.

447
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,110
Isn't that bizarre?

448
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,280
That's the soundmy mom makes

449
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,740
when she climaxes.

450
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,950
Okay. Time for cobbler.

451
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,620
Sorry,one of the dessert platesdoesn't match.

452
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,630
I tried to replace it,but it's spode florence.

453
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,130
It's a rare pattern.

454
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,250
It belongedto my grandmother.

455
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,890
But hopefully onceyou taste the dessert,

456
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,120
you'll forget all about it.

457
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,480
I'm not hungry.

458
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,780
George,you have to have this.It's absolutely scrumptious.

459
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,600
Mmm.

460
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,650
Mmm!

461
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,860
(Mouths words)

462
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,550
go to your room!

463
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,140
George!

464
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,610
You heard me.Go to your room.

465
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,120
Mr. Williams,what's wrong?

466
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,580
Did I say something wrong?

467
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,280
Bree,please back me up.

468
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,630
Well,what did he say?

469
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,770
I can't say. It's too sordid.But he said it!

470
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,930
Are you gonnaback me up or what?

471
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,170
George,I can't allow youto discipline my child

472
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,500
if you won't even tell mewhat he did.

473
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,120
George.

474
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,800
George!

475
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,070
mrs. Solis,david bradley.

476
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,900
Look,I feel really bad about the tone of our meeting,

477
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,070
so to make up for it,I'm gonna do you a favor.

478
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,840
The more I think of it,

479
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,610
the more I'm convinced your marriage is a train wreck--

480
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,670
the gnarly type,you know,mass casualties.

481
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,310
Anyway,I'm passing on the name

482
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,750
of a great divorce lawyer,kir--

483
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,400
you have some nerve,

484
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,440
leaving that messageon my machine.

485
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,540
You realize this isentirely inappropriate?

486
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,310
I will tell youwhat is inappropriate.

487
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:12,780
You making sweeping assumptions about the state of my marriage.

488
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,900
Care for a drink?

489
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,220
No!

490
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,370
I like to keep a clear headwhen I'm telling people off.

491
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,980
What makes you think you knowanything about me or my husband?

492
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,130
Well,your husband's recordspeaks for itself.

493
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,810
With you,I had to relyon my instincts.

494
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,090
Would those bethe same instincts

495
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,590
that picked outthat cologne?

496
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,110
You're privileged.You're pampered.

497
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,280
You're spoiled.

498
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,580
You want what you wantwhen you want it.

499
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,400
You want excitement.

500
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,370
A quickie every five monthsin a prison trailer

501
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,860
isn't gonna scratchthat itch.

502
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,120
With all due respect,I will decide for myself

503
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,300
what needs to be scratchedand when.

504
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,460
Mrs. Solis,you are a beautiful,

505
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,960
desirable woman.

506
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,930
Now your husbandis a dimwit,

507
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,560
corrupt,violent criminal.

508
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:00,190
You could do...so much better.

509
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,300
Are you hitting on me?

510
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,980
What would you sayif I were?

511
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,950
I'd say I'm pregnant.

512
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,590
So I see,you're stuck.

513
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,370
I'm not stuck,mr. Bradley.

514
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,590
Believe it or not,I love my husband.

515
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,400
I charge $700 an hour,

516
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,530
plus xeroxing.

517
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,240
I'll pay you 6,

518
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:29,330
and I expect a conjugal visittomorrow by noon.

519
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,480
Aren't you demanding?

520
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,830
Like you said...

521
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,340
I want what I wantwhen I want it.

522
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,730
So a womanI talked to at social services

523
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,820
said a lot of runawayshang out here.

524
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,790
What?

525
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,780
Just happy to bespending the day with you.

526
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:52,340
At homeless sheltersand bus stations?

527
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,730
I'm gonna go ask these guysif they've seen zach.

528
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,280
I think we'll covermore ground if we split up.

529
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,810
Okay.

530
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,850
Thanks.

531
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,580
Have you seen this boy?

532
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,340
Uh,missing kid. Anyone?

533
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,630
Going once...

534
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,570
going twice?

535
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,180
Oh,do you mind keeping those

536
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,730
and passing them outwhen people get their ice cream?

537
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,350
Huh.

538
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,250
What?

539
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,420
Well,isn't that him,over there?

540
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,970
Oh!

541
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,880
Zach! Zach!

542
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,300
Oh,no,no,no,no.

543
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
No,no,no,no.

544
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,810
Don't,don't,don't,don'T.Zach!

545
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,460
Don't,don'T.Zach,don't run away!

546
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,540
Wait! Come on!

547
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,220
Just--would youget back here?!

548
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:58,550
Come on,really!Let's just talk!

549
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,410
Damn it,zach!

550
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,330
It's enough already.

551
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,810
Aah!Oh!

552
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,470
Uh...

553
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,910
nobody herehas seen zach.

554
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,770
But there's a halfway house

555
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:19,710
on the westsideI want to check... out.

556
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,410
Are you okay?

557
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,300
I got you some ice cream.

558
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,400
You did?

559
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,920
But then I got hungry.

560
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,990
So then I just threwmy ice cream at him and ran.

561
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,210
Well,somebody say something.

562
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,900
Thank godyou were in flats.

563
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,820
I'm still recovering frommike is zach's real father.

564
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,580
I should've told mikeI saw zach.

565
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,250
I'm a horrible person,right?

566
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,660
Oh,susan,come on.

567
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,790
Zach attacked felicia.He blew up your kitchen.

568
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,360
Evidently,he tried to kill mike.

569
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:03,120
I think we can all agreethis kid's a freak.

570
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,430
What do you think,bree?

571
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,740
Well,I think given everythingthat's happened,

572
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,240
it's perfectly justified thatyou'd be frightened of zach.

573
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,360
But...

574
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,830
but zachis mary alice's son.

575
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,020
He grew up playingin our yards.

576
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,180
If he has any hopeof surviving,

577
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,390
I have to believe he's betteroff here than on the streets.

578
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:35,830
I couldn't have imagined

579
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,290
how much going back to workwould upset parker.

580
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:42,200
Look,he's going to be fine.He's just gotta get used

581
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,940
to daddy providingall the love.

582
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,360
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

583
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,600
I am kidding.

584
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,100
Look,kids are resilient.He will adapt.

585
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,290
Tom,he attacked a teacherwith an umbrella.

586
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,070
It was a poke.He poked her.

587
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,260
I don't know.

588
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,430
Maybe I shouldn'tbe working.

589
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,450
The kids wouldcertainly benefit

590
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
from havingtwo stay-at-home parents,

591
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,960
although buying foodmight become an issue.

592
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,720
Maybe I could changemy work schedule,

593
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,570
try and get some flex time.

594
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,850
Would nina go for that?

595
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,240
No. No.

596
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,490
No,no,no!

597
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,130
No,no,no!

598
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:18,480
It would help if youcame up with some ideas.

599
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,980
How about hugs?

600
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:20,580
Hugs?

601
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,080
Yeah,I read inone of those family magazines

602
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,300
the kids are supposedto get,like,ten hugs a day.

603
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,010
It makes 'em feelmore secure.

604
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,060
I say pile on the hugs.

605
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,750
That'll fix everything?Hugs?

606
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,650
Yeah. Come here.

607
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,440
come here.

608
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,380
Hey.

609
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,230
Hi.

610
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,190
It's working,isn't it?

611
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,980
Shut up.

612
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,790
Hey,buddy,you busy?

613
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,670
Yes. Mrs. Mulberry'sreading to me.

614
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,200
Well,isn't she nice?

615
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,860
But it's time for bed,so I'mgonna tuck you in,okay?

616
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,020
I'll take that.

617
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,660
No!

618
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,980
I know thingshave been hard for you

619
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,480
since I started backto work,

620
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,810
but it is just as hard for meto be away from you.

621
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,970
And you just haveto remember

622
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,170
that even whenI'm not around,

623
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,860
my love for you is real.

624
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,330
You may not be ableto see it,

625
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,970
but it's not imaginarylike mrs. Mulberry.

626
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,570
It's real.

627
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,730
Okay,honey?

628
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,990
Mrs. Mulberry is real,

629
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,540
and she said you're a liar.

630
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,560
Parker.

631
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,490
Parker.

632
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,050
We're reading.

633
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,700
I don't understand.

634
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,440
Why can't we see each otheranymore?

635
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,820
Because ever since I found outwhat andrew said to you,

636
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,480
I've been doingsome soul searching,

637
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,060
and I realize thateverything's that happened

638
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,490
is completely my fault.

639
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,100
No,no,no,

640
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,430
that's ridiculous.No,it's not.

641
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,310
All the thingsthat andrew's been saying

642
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,010
and the wayhe's been acting,

643
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,860
it's all connectedto his father's death.

644
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,780
And it's clear to me

645
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,060
that I need to spend more timefocusing on him and his needs.

646
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,880
You know...

647
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,460
you're right. You do needto focus on andrew.

648
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,330
Thank you,george,for being so understanding.

649
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,100
Of course.

650
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,690
So have you thoughtabout counseling?

651
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,720
That placeyou sent him to--

652
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,160
that behavioralmodification camp--

653
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,560
he got counseling there,right?

654
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,610
But I only sent him there

655
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,180
because his behavior at the timewas so completely out of bounds.

656
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,520
You don't think that whathe said to me was out of bounds?

657
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,650
I just think if I spenta lot of time with him,

658
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,940
it'll really help.Why not do both?

659
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,060
Let him spend a few monthswith some caring professionals,

660
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,930
and then bring him home.

661
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,340
You know,what he saidto you was horribly rude,

662
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,210
but that camp,it's extreme,

663
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,570
and,I mean,unless I feltlike andrew was getting

664
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,530
really out of control,then...

665
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,750
well,let's hopeit doesn't come to that.

666
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,770
You know,in spite ofeverything that's happened,

667
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,040
I really like andrew.

668
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,830
Oh,george,really?

669
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,120
Yeah. The truth is...

670
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,720
he reminds me of me.

671
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,660
The conjugal visit rules areyou got 45 minutes.

672
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,240
We call every 15 minutesto make sure you're still here.

673
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,150
You understand?

674
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,310
Yes,we got it.

675
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,850
Uh,we interrupt our lovemakingto answer the phone,

676
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,640
or you call out the dogs.Okay!

677
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,390
I'm ready whenever you...

678
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,580
obviously are.

679
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:17,390
Carlos,are we gonna make it?

680
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,140
We just did.You want to go again?

681
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,840
No,I'm talkingabout us--

682
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,540
our relationship,our marriage.

683
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,410
Carlos,you're goingto be a father.

684
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,790
And when you get outta here,you're gonna need to get a job

685
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:38,400
and make an honest livingfor me and our child.

686
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,330
Babe,I've learned my lesson.

687
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:44,400
Okay,when I get out of here,everything's gonna be different.

688
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,000
We're going to start over witha new life and a great family,

689
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,290
and nothing is going toget in the way of that.

690
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,890
Hey,so you never told me--

691
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,110
how's the new lawyer?You like him?

692
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,860
yeah.

693
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,670
Yeah,I'm still here.

694
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,850
Okay,enough chitchat.We only have 30 minutes left,

695
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,780
and I want to makethe most of it.

696
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,840
Okay,please--please don't run.

697
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,990
I can'T. I hurt my foot.

698
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,390
How?

699
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:47,100
I landed on it funny whenI was running away from you.

700
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,610
What do you want?

701
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,240
To talk to you.

702
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,220
Why?

703
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,240
'Cause I havea lot of things to say.

704
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,580
So you can just listen.I'll buy you some food.

705
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,790
When was the last timeyou ate?

706
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:09,560
My dad's alive?Where is he?

707
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,790
I don't know.He disappeared.

708
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,600
But mike did not kill him.I mean,he's alive,you swear?

709
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,440
I swear.Maybe he's in utah.

710
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:20,300
I know that he used tohave a life there--

711
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,000
before me.

712
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,190
I don't know.I just--I just--

713
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,390
I need to get some moneyand find him.

714
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,570
Zach,you know what I think?

715
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,970
I think you should come back with me.Why?

716
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,290
Because there are still peopleat home that care about you.

717
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:35,580
And there's thingsthat you need to know.

718
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,560
Like what?

719
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,120
Well,I can't tell you.

720
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,250
You know,you messed upa lot of people's lives,zach.

721
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,450
You can't run awayfrom that.

722
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,550
Do you mean julie?

723
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,570
What?

724
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,230
I know that I messed upher life,

725
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,590
but I didn't mean to.

726
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,510
I really miss herout here.

727
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,910
I think about herall the time.

728
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,860
Yeah,well,julie'sa really special girl.

729
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:05,360
Has she said anythingabout me?

730
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:09,600
Because if she has,then I mightstill have a chance with her.

731
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,050
If I come backwith you,

732
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,380
then I-I couldmake it up to her.

733
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,330
Do you know what I think?

734
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,080
I think you were right.

735
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:26,630
I think you shouldtry to find your father first.

736
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,690
Yeah?Yeah.

737
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,620
I mean,now that you know he's okay,

738
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,910
you should go to him.

739
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,440
He'll want totake care of you.

740
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,610
That's what parents do.

741
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,750
Let me help.

742
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,780
How much money do you thinkyou'll need to get to utah?

743
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,480
Daddy,I can't findmrs. Mulberry's umbrella.

744
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,310
Where is it?

745
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,990
Oh,I don't know,sport. Honey,have you seen the umbrella?

746
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,180
No,can't say that I have.

747
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,940
Okay,listen,don't worry about it.

748
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:52,230
I'm sure mrs. Mulberry'saround here somewhere.

749
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,920
Or,uh,maybe she's not.

750
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:01,190
She could've left.You know...

751
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,370
maybe she had someother little boy

752
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,670
that she needed to help.

753
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,430
Like who?

754
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,970
I don't know. It could bea little boy in,uh...

755
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,040
england...

756
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,700
named... spencer.

757
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,590
Lynette?

758
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,250
I mean,this isconjecture on my part.

759
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:23,300
But it is possible thatsomeone like little spencer

760
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:28,270
needs mrs. Mulberry more,'cause he doesn't have a daddy

761
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,690
and a mommy who love him.

762
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,180
Yeah,that's it.

763
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,560
He's an orphan...

764
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,910
with no hands.

765
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,010
Okay?

766
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,310
You're so sweet. Come here.I love you. You all right?

767
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,520
Okay,go get dressed.

768
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,370
What have you doneto mrs. Mulberry?

769
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,300
Until there's a body,there's no evidence of a crime.

770
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,100
Mrs. Mulberry!

771
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,210
She's back!

772
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,680

00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,730

00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,940

784
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,960
Andrew needs his space.

786
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,560

And I completely understand

788
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,610

789
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,350
I did want to give youa little good-bye gift.

790
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,530

791
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,070

792
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,070
It's my pattern!Where did you find it?

793
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,790

795
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,170

796
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,690
Oh,george!

797
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,110
George.

798
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,950
George.

799
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,460
Andrew,what are you doing?!

800
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,360
Andrew!

801
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,740
Get off of him,andrew!

802
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,060
Stop it!

803
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,970
Knock it off!

804
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,060
Did you see him?!He was kissing her!

805
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,610
Oh,my god,you're bleeding.

806
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,770
That freak was kissing her!

807
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,210
I don't care.You gotta calm down now.

808
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,490
The world is filled with good fathers.

809
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:37,080
How do we recognize them?

810
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,860
They're the ones who are missed so terribly

811
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:45,220
that everything falls apart in their absence.

812
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,320
They're the ones who love us

813
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,190
long before we've even arrived.

814
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:01,030
They're the ones who come looking for us

815
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:04,870
when we can't find our way home.

816
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,400
hey,what's wrong?

817
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,240
Because of me,

818
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:22,740
my son's imaginary friendgot crushed by a garbage truck.

819
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,180
I am the worst personin the world.

820
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:33,270
Yes,the world is filled with good fathers...

821
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:38,390
honey,he is going to getover this in no time. Trust me.

822
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,160
And one daywhen he is all grown up,

823
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,230
you and parker are going tolaugh hysterically about this.

824
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,480
You really think so?Really?

825
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,920
And the best

826
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,530
are the ones who make the women in their lives...

827
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,630
I promise.

828
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:58,730
Feel like good mothers.
