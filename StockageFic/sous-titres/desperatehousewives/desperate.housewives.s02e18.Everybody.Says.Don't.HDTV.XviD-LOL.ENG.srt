1
00:00:00,059 --> 00:00:01,759
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,213
Well, if Libby here likes
us as much as we like her,

3
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,925
we should just go ahead and
move to adopt her baby girl.

4
00:00:06,926 --> 00:00:09,009
- Who's the father?
- Honestly, I don't know.

5
00:00:09,044 --> 00:00:11,011
Carlos and Gaby made a deal.

6
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:13,347
I did remarry my ex,
but it was only because

7
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,766
- he has great health insurance.
- Susan made amends.

8
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,768
You know, I never thought
I'd have such a good time

9
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,921
hanging out with my girlfriend
and her husband.

10
00:00:19,962 --> 00:00:22,305
- And Mike...
- Didn't she mention we dated?

11
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,926
- ... made a confession...
- Liar! You've just been leading me on!

12
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:27,428
You're obviously still in love
with this guy!

13
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,971
- ... of his own.

14
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:30,973
On her first day of sobriety,

15
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:33,059
Bree Van De Kamp found an old cork,

16
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,230
which reminded her just how
much she craved Chablis.

17
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:42,297
So she called her sponsor,
who came over with a DVD

18
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:46,287
which they watched
till her craving had passed.

19
00:00:46,322 --> 00:00:50,076
Five days later, after she
developed a thirst for Merlot,

20
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,752
Peter arrived with a deck of cards.

21
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:55,289
The next week, he brought
over Chinese takeout

22
00:00:55,324 --> 00:00:57,256
because Bree had told him

23
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:01,671
she was consumed by thoughts
of vintage Chardonnay.

24
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:07,383
By her 20th day of sobriety, Bree had
stopped thinking about alcohol altogether

25
00:01:07,426 --> 00:01:12,306
because her thoughts were
now centered elsewhere.

26
00:01:12,348 --> 00:01:14,225
Hmm...

27
00:01:16,894 --> 00:01:20,606
I'm curious, Peter. What is the
easiest way to overcome addiction?

28
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:23,401
Oh, some folks try shock therapy.

29
00:01:23,442 --> 00:01:25,403
Other use, uh, hypnosis.

30
00:01:25,444 --> 00:01:27,405
But taking it one day at a time

31
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:29,407
still makes the most sense to me.

32
00:01:29,448 --> 00:01:30,408
Why?

33
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:34,787
I don't know. I guess I'm just
impatient to get on with my life.

34
00:01:38,374 --> 00:01:39,834
What are you doing?

35
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,795
I was just giving you a little kiss.

36
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:44,463
Why?

37
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,966
Well, it's just my way of saying thank you

38
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,761
for everything you've done for
me over the past few weeks.

39
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:53,354
What's... wrong?

40
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:56,392
This is gonna seem like it's
coming out of left field,

41
00:01:56,427 --> 00:01:58,894
but in addition to being
a recovering alcoholic,

42
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:01,147
I'm also a member of S.A.

43
00:02:02,982 --> 00:02:04,609
Sex addicts anonymous.

44
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,282
Oh. And that's a-a real thing?

45
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:14,493
Yes. And sex is as much an
addiction for me as booze.

46
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,996
That's why when you turn me on like that,

47
00:02:17,038 --> 00:02:20,708
- it's a bit of a problem.
- It was just a peck on the cheek.

48
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,337
It doesn't matter. The slightest
touch gets my juices flowing.

49
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:30,384
- So, how long has it been since you...
- A year.

50
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:32,803
They have this rule... plant, pet, person.

51
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:35,097
If I can keep a plant alive, you know,

52
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:37,099
then I can move on to a pet.

53
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:40,061
And if I can make that work,
then I can start dating again.

54
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:42,355
So how are you doing?

55
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:45,858
- I'm on my fourth ficus.
- Oh.

56
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:56,202
See?

57
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:58,204
I think you can handle affection

58
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:00,248
better than you give yourself credit for.

59
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:16,973
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:18,975
Um... I think I should go.

61
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:20,309
- Really?
- Yeah.

62
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:24,063
But... but... you forgot your shirt!

63
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:25,856
Keep it.

64
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,610
Though she didn't know it,

65
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:32,119
Bree had answered her own question.

66
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:36,617
The easiest way to overcome one addiction...

67
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:40,788
is to replace it with another.

68
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,489
2x18:
Everybody Says Don't

69
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:49,113
Temptation...

70
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:51,490
it's the name of a well-known establishment

71
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,743
on the outskirts of Fairview.

72
00:03:53,784 --> 00:03:57,163
Its clientele is devoted.

73
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,623
Everyone who goes there

74
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:02,510
wants to get their hands on something.

75
00:04:02,545 --> 00:04:05,179
And when they cross a line...

76
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:06,931
Hey! I warned you, pal.

77
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:09,684
... they are punished...

78
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:12,687
as a certain married couple
was about to discover.

79
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:15,189
Hi.

80
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:16,691
You want a lap dance?

81
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:20,069
Uh...

82
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:22,238
No, thanks. No.

83
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:28,077
I sure hope Libby likes this camera.

84
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:30,746
Well, why wouldn't she? It's
exactly what she asked for,

85
00:04:30,788 --> 00:04:32,748
the most expensive one in the store.

86
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,750
You know, I'm telling you, Carlos,

87
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:36,752
I'm getting really tired of kissing her ass.

88
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:38,754
The woman is giving us her baby.

89
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:40,923
We'll kiss whatever needs kissing.

90
00:04:40,965 --> 00:04:43,217
What the hell are you guys doing here?

91
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,219
Uh, we brought you this gift,

92
00:04:45,261 --> 00:04:48,848
and you said that you didn't
want us coming by your house...

93
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,892
Thanks, but I'm working, so you gotta go.

94
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:52,894
Look, we spent a lot of money on that.

95
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:54,896
The least you can do is open it

96
00:04:54,937 --> 00:04:57,440
so we can bask in your happy expression.

97
00:04:57,481 --> 00:04:58,941
Is there a problem here?

98
00:04:58,983 --> 00:05:01,235
No, we're just talking.
Everything's fine.

99
00:05:01,277 --> 00:05:03,404
Carlos Solis. This is my wife, Gabrielle.

100
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:04,906
We're friends of Libby's.

101
00:05:04,947 --> 00:05:08,242
Oh, hey, I'm Frank, Libby's boyfriend.

102
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:12,121
Libby, you didn't tell
us you had a boyfriend.

103
00:05:12,163 --> 00:05:14,207
Didn't I? I thought I had.

104
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,918
What's that, a present for our baby?

105
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:21,672
I'm sorry, did you just say "our" baby?

106
00:05:21,707 --> 00:05:25,635
Yeah. It's our first.

107
00:05:27,345 --> 00:05:29,430
Hey!

108
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:30,932
What's for lunch?

109
00:05:30,973 --> 00:05:33,017
Omelettes. You want me to make you one?

110
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:34,977
No, thank you. I'll just pick at yours.

111
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:37,438
I didn't know you still had a key, Dad.

112
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:38,905
Of course I do.

113
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,816
I have to watch out for
my two favorite ladies.

114
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:43,486
Try the cheese.
That's the best part.

115
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:46,405
You mean, two of your three favorite ladies.

116
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,158
You know, when you add in Edie.

117
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,042
Right! Of course.

118
00:05:51,077 --> 00:05:54,330
And speaking of Edie, I have some big news.

119
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:57,124
I finally did it. I popped the question.

120
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,001
Oh! Congratulations, Dad!

121
00:05:59,043 --> 00:06:00,753
Yeah... congratulations.

122
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:04,048
Um, what happened to waiting six months?

123
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,641
Edie and I aren't
getting married tomorrow.

124
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:10,555
It takes months to plan
a classy wedding, you know?

125
00:06:10,596 --> 00:06:13,891
Remember ours, hmm? You had
to have it outdoors, huh?

126
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,310
Ugh. It poured.

127
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:18,020
I could have murdered that weatherman.

128
00:06:18,062 --> 00:06:21,315
We were all crammed under
this little gazebo thing.

129
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:23,317
It was hysterical.

130
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:25,736
I thought the whole wedding day was ruined.

131
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:27,738
I loved it! It felt spontaneous.

132
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,410
All our friends gathered
close around us, hmm?

133
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:35,002
Remember?

134
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:38,666
You said it was the happiest
day of your life.

135
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:44,922
Just like you marrying Edie

136
00:06:44,964 --> 00:06:47,383
will be the happiest day of her life.

137
00:06:47,425 --> 00:06:49,510
Yeah. Right.

138
00:06:49,552 --> 00:06:51,679
Her, too.

139
00:06:51,714 --> 00:06:53,806
Toodles.

140
00:06:58,477 --> 00:06:59,916
Oh, hi.

141
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:01,355
Hello.

142
00:07:01,397 --> 00:07:04,525
Andrew said it was all right
for me to get a cream soda.

143
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:06,861
Uh, sure. Help yourself.

144
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:09,071
There's also frosted glasses in the freezer.

145
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:11,240
Can is fine, but thank you.

146
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:13,910
Oh, and, uh, I left a list for you

147
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:16,787
of the witnesses we'll be deposing.

148
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:18,956
It's, uh, there on the counter.

149
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:31,010
Hi.

150
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:32,220
Hey.

151
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:37,558
I know that you're still
angry with me, and, um...

152
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,105
I wanted to tell you that I have, um...

153
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:45,942
joined a recovery program.

154
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:48,201
A.A.

155
00:07:48,236 --> 00:07:51,322
I just wanted you to know that...

156
00:07:51,364 --> 00:07:53,991
and to tell you I'm sorry.

157
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:55,993
You are...

158
00:07:56,035 --> 00:07:58,454
a real friend, and I value your honesty.

159
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:03,084
Oh, I don't wanna be mad anymore.

160
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,086
And I'm so happy to hear all that,

161
00:08:05,127 --> 00:08:07,755
- and I am so proud of you.
- Oh, thanks,

162
00:08:07,797 --> 00:08:09,757
but I'm not really out of the woods yet.

163
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:12,635
I still have this whole court
case hanging over my head.

164
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,101
I heard about that.

165
00:08:14,136 --> 00:08:16,430
Andrew's asking to be emancipated?

166
00:08:16,472 --> 00:08:18,432
Yes, and his lawyer is taking
depositions now

167
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:20,810
to see if I am a fit parent.

168
00:08:20,852 --> 00:08:22,353
Oh.

169
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:24,856
And considering that mishap
that I had with your kids,

170
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:27,483
I, uh, I imagine he'll
be anxious to talk to you.

171
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:29,827
Well, it makes sense, I guess.

172
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:31,203
Yeah.

173
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:33,747
Do you have any idea what you might say?

174
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,002
I, um...

175
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:44,800
I'll focus on your good qualities.

176
00:08:47,303 --> 00:08:49,722
I could not ask for anything more.

177
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,390
Thanks.

178
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:54,101
- See you around, I hope.
- All right.

179
00:08:54,443 --> 00:08:58,155
That's... not why you
came to apologize, is it?

180
00:08:58,197 --> 00:08:59,656
What do you mean?

181
00:08:59,698 --> 00:09:02,951
To soften me up for the deposition?

182
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:05,370
Of course not.

183
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,502
Um...

184
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:15,088
I just want you to understand something.

185
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,758
Andrew is making accusations...

186
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,552
false accusations, saying that I abused him,

187
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:23,639
all because I wouldn't let
him have his trust fund early

188
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,641
so he could buy a car.

189
00:09:25,682 --> 00:09:28,685
I mean, can you blame me for wanting to know

190
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:31,271
if I have your support?

191
00:09:31,306 --> 00:09:33,065
And...

192
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,359
so... what,

193
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,278
you want me to lie? Make you look good?

194
00:09:41,532 --> 00:09:44,243
I actually don't want anything of the sort.

195
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:47,121
Good.

196
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:49,123
Because when I give my deposition,

197
00:09:49,164 --> 00:09:51,125
I'm going to tell the truth.

198
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:05,347
To what do I owe this pleasure?

199
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:07,391
I want you to look at something.

200
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:15,656
Myra Holt is talking to Paul Young,

201
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:18,777
chatting away with him as though
he were any other neighbor.

202
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,779
Now I told her he killed my sister.

203
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,115
I mentioned it to her six
months ago when we were

204
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:25,117
standing in the express line at the market.

205
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,119
But still, there she is, yakking away.

206
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:29,253
Oh, Mike.

207
00:10:29,288 --> 00:10:32,291
I'm afraid people's memories
aren't what they used to be.

208
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,210
What do you want, Felicia?

209
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:37,588
I wanna see how good your memory is,

210
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:40,591
if you recall a certain
promise you made to me.

211
00:10:40,632 --> 00:10:44,052
- I am not gonna kill him.
- Why not? Give me one good reason.

212
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:46,430
Because things have changed.

213
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:48,432
How? My sister still lies
rotting in the ground.

214
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:51,518
So does Deirdre. No, I don't
see how anything's changed at all.

215
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,604
You're just gonna have to let this go.

216
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:57,065
Sounds to me as though
someone's let go of his rage.

217
00:10:57,107 --> 00:11:00,027
Maybe I have.

218
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:02,613
Well, I haven't.

219
00:11:06,108 --> 00:11:08,094
That bitch of a stripper lied to us.

220
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:09,855
The father's totally in the dark.

221
00:11:09,897 --> 00:11:14,458
- He clearly wants to keep the baby.
- Mr. Solis, if the father wants

222
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,960
to assert his rights here,
there's nothing we can do.

223
00:11:17,002 --> 00:11:18,886
I'll find you another baby. I promise.

224
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:21,924
- I don't want another baby. I want this one!
- Oh, honey, he's right, okay.

225
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,551
That trashy girl has been
lying to us from the get-go.

226
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:27,221
Let's just walk away while
we can. It's not worth it.

227
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:30,015
Look, don't get cold feet
now, Gaby, please. All right?

228
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:32,017
Let's just pay Frank the way we paid Libby

229
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,895
- and then bring the baby home.
- Wait, wait, wait.

230
00:11:34,937 --> 00:11:36,438
You paid Libby?

231
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,440
You said we could give her gifts.

232
00:11:38,482 --> 00:11:40,526
Everybody loves getting cash.

233
00:11:41,944 --> 00:11:44,947
I could probably be disbarred
for even listening to this.

234
00:11:44,988 --> 00:11:46,490
I cannot condone baby-buying!

235
00:11:46,532 --> 00:11:49,493
And I sure as hell can't be part of it.

236
00:11:49,535 --> 00:11:50,911
Oh, Mr. Beale, come on.

237
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:52,663
No, no, hear me out.

238
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:55,457
If you are determined to
go down this dark road,

239
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:57,918
and unbeknownst to me steal this...

240
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,212
paternal rights waiver
that's sitting on my desk,

241
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:03,257
and have this Frank guy sign
both sides and date the top,

242
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:06,677
I can't be part of that, either.

243
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:10,264
Hmm.

244
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,853
Okay, I-I'm gonna go to Dad's.

245
00:12:15,894 --> 00:12:18,063
Oh, wait! Why don't you let me walk with you?

246
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,731
Uh, shouldn't you be resting?

247
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:21,233
No! I'm fine.

248
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:23,735
The doctor said I should actually
keep my blood flowing.

249
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,738
Well, do you have to
while we walk over to Edie's?

250
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,576
I just... I don't wanna
risk you running into Dad.

251
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,077
Okay.

252
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,079
You guys have just been so chummy lately,

253
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:37,291
and... this whole flirting thing
is kind of freaking me out.

254
00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:40,002
Wait a second, we're... we're not flirting.

255
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:42,504
Mom, you fed him eggs with your fork.

256
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:44,882
Okay, yes,

257
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:48,010
I am closer to your father
than I have been in the past.

258
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:52,055
The bitter hatred's now settled
into a respectful disgust.

259
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:53,557
That's the kind of thing

260
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:55,601
most children of divorce dream about.

261
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:02,524
Hey, Edie. What's all this stuff for?

262
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:05,277
Oh, hi! Don't tell anyone,

263
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:07,321
but I'm planning a huge surprise for Karl.

264
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:08,655
A surprise?

265
00:13:08,697 --> 00:13:10,657
Yeah, I'm putting together
an engagement party

266
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:11,867
tomorrow afternoon.

267
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:13,125
Oh, cool.

268
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,586
But that's not the surprise.

269
00:13:15,621 --> 00:13:18,457
Actually, it's gonna be a surprise wedding.

270
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:25,255
I know. My Pilates teacher
got ordained over the internet.

271
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:28,091
The, uh, church of the
divine something or other.

272
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:30,552
I'm not sure. Anyway, it's all legal.

273
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:32,519
And, well, just one more day

274
00:13:32,554 --> 00:13:35,974
before I make an honest
man out of your Daddy.

275
00:13:39,228 --> 00:13:42,189
Oh! You're so sweet.

276
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:46,318
Thank you so much for your good wishes.

277
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,738
Oh. No, Edie, wait. Um, no, it's just that...

278
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,073
you know, I was married to Karl,

279
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:53,791
and I used to... try to surprise him,

280
00:13:53,826 --> 00:13:57,913
and he would always, always, always say...

281
00:13:57,955 --> 00:14:01,875
"no, Susan. Don't surprise
me. I don't like it."

282
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:05,212
Whatever. I'm doing it,
so keep your trap shut.

283
00:14:05,254 --> 00:14:07,464
Now if you'll excuse me,

284
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:10,050
I've gotta go and buy a wedding dress.

285
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:12,559
Oh, and by the way, I'll be wearing white,

286
00:14:12,594 --> 00:14:16,223
so that'll be a surprise
for everybody.

287
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:24,106
I don't know why I have
to get dragged into this.

288
00:14:24,148 --> 00:14:25,607
What happened with my kids

289
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:28,277
has nothing to do with Bree's
situation with Andrew.

290
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:29,528
Sit.

291
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,453
Well, it's my understanding

292
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:33,844
that real harm could have
come to your children

293
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:36,201
as a direct result of your friend's behavior.

294
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:38,454
I'm sorry, Mr. Bormanis,
but I'm not gonna testify.

295
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:40,421
It just doesn't feel right to me.

296
00:14:40,456 --> 00:14:45,002
Well, this isn't the first time
someone's felt the way you do.

297
00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:48,797
So this isn't the first
time I've had to say that

298
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,967
if you refuse to give a deposition
of your own accord,

299
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:53,635
I'll compel you to give one.

300
00:14:57,222 --> 00:14:59,224
But I'm sure I won't have to.

301
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:10,486
You're saying Bree did this?

302
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:12,154
While under the influence.

303
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:17,493
I understand your reluctance
to turn on a friend,

304
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:20,037
but this isn't about you.

305
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:22,039
It's about Andrew.

306
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,625
Don't you think he's suffered enough?

307
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:32,883
How much are you gonna give him?

308
00:15:32,918 --> 00:15:34,885
I figured we could start with forty.

309
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:36,345
Thousand?

310
00:15:36,386 --> 00:15:39,723
He's a bouncer in a strip
club. Offer him eight.

311
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:42,392
He's not going to sell his baby for $8,000.

312
00:15:42,434 --> 00:15:44,561
Are we talking about the same idiot?

313
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:46,688
I think for $8,000, you throw in a kidney.

314
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,482
I'm not gonna blow this by bargain hunting.

315
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:50,449
You know, that's your problem, Carlos.

316
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:53,195
Remember when you bought
your car? You paid sticker.

317
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:56,031
- Nobody pays sticker!
- Okay, and what's the sticker price on a child, huh?

318
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:58,534
- Tell me that.
- I'm thinking twelve.

319
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,955
Frank, you have to sign the paper.

320
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,547
- I made a deal with these people.
- A deal?

321
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:08,919
This isn't a used car we're
talking about. It's our baby.

322
00:16:08,954 --> 00:16:10,385
Before you screw this up,

323
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,006
just remember that I can
go to the cops and tell them

324
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:15,884
about the pot farm you have
going on in our basement.

325
00:16:17,553 --> 00:16:19,054
It's just a couple plants.

326
00:16:19,096 --> 00:16:22,015
Yeah, I don't do it for profits.

327
00:16:22,057 --> 00:16:23,559
Hobby, mostly.

328
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,561
Oh, come on, Frank. You know
you would be a lousy father.

329
00:16:26,596 --> 00:16:29,523
It's my kid! And I have a right
to mess her up if I want.

330
00:16:29,565 --> 00:16:32,609
And if you go near the
police, I'll tell 'em how

331
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:35,779
you've been stealing all
those tips from Sheila.

332
00:16:35,814 --> 00:16:37,246
Okay, we're done.

333
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:40,325
Gaby, Gaby, no, just... hold on.

334
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:43,704
Now maybe there's a way that
we can work this out together.

335
00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:45,706
There is nothing to work out.

336
00:16:45,747 --> 00:16:48,250
If Frank is not on board
with this, it's over.

337
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:51,211
Wait! Uh... it doesn't matter what he wants.

338
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:53,130
Why not?

339
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:55,007
Because it's not your baby.

340
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:58,302
That's a lie.

341
00:16:58,343 --> 00:17:01,680
What if I took a paternity
test? Will that shut you up?

342
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:03,974
Wait, if it's not Frank's, then whose is it?

343
00:17:04,016 --> 00:17:06,101
I'm not sure.

344
00:17:06,136 --> 00:17:08,152
All's I know is,

345
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:11,148
I got pregnant right after
I worked at the Calgary rodeo,

346
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,616
and I was very popular there.

347
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:17,321
So what are you saying, you
screwed a bunch of cowboys?

348
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:20,741
You have your hobbies...

349
00:17:20,783 --> 00:17:22,576
and I have mine.

350
00:17:26,538 --> 00:17:28,665
You think this is funny?

351
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,793
Oh, don't you get it?

352
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:33,295
We just got our baby back.

353
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:40,469
Um...

354
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:45,933
Well, you take care now.

355
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,937
Ahem. Yeah.

356
00:17:52,815 --> 00:17:53,947
Hi.

357
00:17:53,982 --> 00:17:55,984
I got, uh, your message

358
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:58,779
that you wanted to see me
before the meeting started.

359
00:17:58,821 --> 00:18:02,616
Yeah, I did. Um, there's someone
I'd like to introduce you to.

360
00:18:04,743 --> 00:18:07,086
Bree, this is Donna.

361
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:10,082
- Donna, this is Bree.
- What's up?

362
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:11,166
Hi.

363
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,710
Donna is gonna be your new sponsor.

364
00:18:13,752 --> 00:18:16,463
I, um, I don't want a new sponsor.

365
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:19,508
I'm... I'm very comfortable working with you.

366
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:25,347
Look, this was always just
a temporary arrangement.

367
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:27,349
And given what happened the other night,

368
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:30,018
I think it's best if we just end this now.

369
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,187
Peter, all we did was kiss.

370
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:40,070
We'd be kidding ourselves
if we didn't think that

371
00:18:40,112 --> 00:18:43,323
whatever's between us isn't
going to affect our recovery.

372
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:46,535
It's not a good time for
change in my life, Peter.

373
00:18:46,577 --> 00:18:50,080
Terrible things are happening.
I'm headed to court.

374
00:18:50,122 --> 00:18:52,499
I need your support now more than ever.

375
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,460
You'll have support, Bree.

376
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:56,503
It just won't be mine.

377
00:18:56,545 --> 00:18:57,880
But, Peter...

378
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:04,052
Oh, Bree could never have done that!

379
00:19:04,094 --> 00:19:06,096
I'm just telling you what the lawyer said.

380
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:08,348
So you think Bree punched Andrew in the face?

381
00:19:08,383 --> 00:19:09,815
'Cause I don't.

382
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,187
I don't either, but on the other hand,

383
00:19:13,228 --> 00:19:16,190
she spanked my kids, she
lied about her drinking

384
00:19:16,231 --> 00:19:19,610
and I once saw her bitch
slap her mother-in-law.

385
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:21,320
So I'm torn.

386
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,655
Well, I'm siding with Bree.

387
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:26,825
How can you be so sure?

388
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:30,454
We have Andrew saying that it's
systematic physical abuse.

389
00:19:30,496 --> 00:19:32,456
And then we have Bree saying

390
00:19:32,498 --> 00:19:34,458
it's Andrew wanting to be emancipated

391
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,461
so he can get at his trust
fund so he can buy a car.

392
00:19:37,503 --> 00:19:39,713
How are we supposed to know the real truth?

393
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:41,882
Because I remember being 17.

394
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:44,718
And I would've done a hell of a lot more

395
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,596
than punch myself in the eye to get a car.

396
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:53,852
Karl!

397
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:55,854
Karl, stop! Stop!

398
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:57,940
Oh! It's an emergency.

399
00:19:57,981 --> 00:19:59,942
Just calm down. What's going on?

400
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:02,986
- Edie is gonna marry you tomorrow.
- What?

401
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:04,988
She's planned this whole secret wedding.

402
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,406
It's a surprise.

403
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:08,951
God, I hate surprises!

404
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:10,452
I know. I told her that.

405
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:13,163
I said, "he always, always hates surprises."

406
00:20:13,205 --> 00:20:16,187
All right, don't get yourself
all worked up here.

407
00:20:16,222 --> 00:20:19,169
Put our heads together. We'll
come up with something.

408
00:20:19,211 --> 00:20:21,505
So the thing you gotta know about me

409
00:20:21,547 --> 00:20:23,298
is my style is proactive.

410
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,926
I don't hold your hand if you go on a bender.

411
00:20:25,968 --> 00:20:28,095
I believe in behavior modification.

412
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:30,472
Hmm. Some muffins?

413
00:20:30,514 --> 00:20:33,475
Oh. Oh, that's okay. I-I'm not big on snacks.

414
00:20:33,517 --> 00:20:35,644
You should also know...

415
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:37,187
I'm not a lesbian.

416
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:40,774
Oh!

417
00:20:40,816 --> 00:20:42,282
Well, good for you.

418
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:46,488
Well, see, if I was, the program
wouldn't let me be your sponsor.

419
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,990
Not great for your recovery

420
00:20:48,031 --> 00:20:50,534
if we get tangled up in a little somethin'.

421
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:54,037
So, um, whatever vibe you might be getting,

422
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,581
that's all on you.

423
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,543
Um, Donna...

424
00:21:01,753 --> 00:21:05,591
I-I really appreciate everything
that you've been doing for me,

425
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:08,051
but I think I was really making some progress

426
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:10,053
with Peter as my sponsor.

427
00:21:10,095 --> 00:21:13,098
- And I was thinking...
- All right, stop right there!

428
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,725
You're fixating on Peter.

429
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:17,311
Well, I just really feel like
I'm jeopardizing my recovery

430
00:21:17,352 --> 00:21:19,730
- by switching...
-You're making excuses.

431
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:24,026
See, I have a 99% success rate as a sponsor

432
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:26,487
because I have 0% tolerance

433
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:28,697
for people who lie to themselves.

434
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:30,199
Now come on.

435
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,493
Come on? Where are we going?

436
00:21:32,534 --> 00:21:35,788
Hiking. There's nothing like it
to take your mind off booze.

437
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:39,958
I got it!

438
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,503
I'll just be the woman.
I'll say I want a big wedding.

439
00:21:42,544 --> 00:21:44,505
You know, the church, the big ballroom,

440
00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:47,049
smushing cake in her face...
it'll take months to plan.

441
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,676
- That's great.
- And of course, I'll have to tell her

442
00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:51,678
you're the one who ruined the surprise.

443
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,014
You're gonna make me take the hit?

444
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:55,182
Yeah.

445
00:21:57,184 --> 00:22:00,062
Hey, guys. What you doing out here?

446
00:22:00,103 --> 00:22:02,147
Uh, just talking.

447
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:04,775
Oh, well, come on in. I've
got something to show you.

448
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:06,860
Oh, no, that's okay.

449
00:22:06,902 --> 00:22:08,695
Come on! You'll love this.

450
00:22:12,616 --> 00:22:16,829
Wait until I leave to tell her,
'cause she's gonna kill me.

451
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:24,169
Well, I should go.

452
00:22:25,671 --> 00:22:27,513
I'm not gonna scream or cry

453
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:29,550
or pound your faces in with a mallet,

454
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:32,261
which, Lord knows, is my right.

455
00:22:32,302 --> 00:22:34,263
But what I will say is that you two

456
00:22:34,304 --> 00:22:37,182
are the most reprehensible
excuses for human beings

457
00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:40,060
that I have ever met!

458
00:22:40,102 --> 00:22:42,896
Do you have anything to add?

459
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:51,321
Right. What the hell.

460
00:23:15,846 --> 00:23:17,598
Hey, Mrs. Scavo.

461
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:20,350
That's a... that's a sweet ride.

462
00:23:20,392 --> 00:23:23,520
Yeah, you think so?

463
00:23:23,562 --> 00:23:25,522
Why don't you come over here for a second?

464
00:23:25,564 --> 00:23:27,775
I'd like to pick your brain.

465
00:23:30,986 --> 00:23:33,447
You're the demographic that
my client is interested in,

466
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:35,449
so you'd actually be doing me a favor

467
00:23:35,491 --> 00:23:37,451
if you drove it around for a couple hours,

468
00:23:37,493 --> 00:23:40,704
and tell me what you thought. Do you mind?

469
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:43,172
Are you kidding me?

470
00:23:43,207 --> 00:23:46,293
I can't believe you are old enough to drive.

471
00:23:46,335 --> 00:23:48,420
I still remember when you were 10 years old.

472
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:50,672
I paid you a dollar to rake our leaves.

473
00:23:50,714 --> 00:23:51,882
Yeah.

474
00:23:51,924 --> 00:23:53,675
Yeah, you were pretty cheap.

475
00:23:56,553 --> 00:23:58,771
Is this set up for MP3?

476
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:01,141
Uh, all the bells and whistles.

477
00:24:01,176 --> 00:24:02,893
But listen...

478
00:24:02,935 --> 00:24:05,729
I really wanted to tell you how sorry I am.

479
00:24:05,771 --> 00:24:07,606
Hmm?

480
00:24:09,316 --> 00:24:12,194
Your lawyer came to see me.

481
00:24:12,229 --> 00:24:15,037
I'm going to be deposed.

482
00:24:15,072 --> 00:24:18,325
It's going to be hard for me...

483
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:21,912
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

484
00:24:21,954 --> 00:24:24,498
You just have to remember

485
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,251
she's a different person when she drinks.

486
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:29,169
She must be.

487
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:33,590
It's hard for me to imagine the Bree
I know capable of hurting you.

488
00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:36,093
Yeah.

489
00:24:36,135 --> 00:24:37,594
Do you have the keys?

490
00:24:37,636 --> 00:24:39,937
Oh. Sure.

491
00:24:39,972 --> 00:24:41,932
Anyway, I just...

492
00:24:41,974 --> 00:24:45,519
I feel so guilty that this
all went on in your house,

493
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:47,903
right under our nose.

494
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:51,483
So if there is anything
I can do to help you...

495
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:53,944
Well, can you get a discount on these?

496
00:24:56,238 --> 00:24:58,490
Um...

497
00:24:58,532 --> 00:25:01,452
actually, yeah. One of the perks.

498
00:25:01,493 --> 00:25:05,664
Even so, it's a little out of the
price range of a high school student.

499
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:07,666
Well, if you tell my lawyer the truth,

500
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:11,253
I don't think money's gonna be a problem.

501
00:25:15,507 --> 00:25:17,468
Hi. What's going on?

502
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,018
Edie wants to discuss
our little... deception.

503
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:29,646
Exactly how ugly is this gonna get?

504
00:25:29,688 --> 00:25:33,984
How long does it take to shut a door?

505
00:25:34,026 --> 00:25:36,028
I can forgive your trickery.

506
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:39,364
I can forgive the humiliation.

507
00:25:39,406 --> 00:25:40,866
But what I can't forgive

508
00:25:40,908 --> 00:25:43,535
is the complete and utter
lack of faith in me!

509
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:47,372
I mean, having Susan get married
for insurance was my idea!

510
00:25:47,414 --> 00:25:49,374
Okay, so if I'd known that everything

511
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:52,336
had gotten all screwed up,
of course I would've agreed.

512
00:25:52,377 --> 00:25:54,505
Look, Edie, in retrospect...

513
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:56,715
yes, we didn't think.

514
00:25:56,757 --> 00:26:00,969
We didn't handle this the way
mature adults should have.

515
00:26:01,011 --> 00:26:03,972
He's right. We behaved like children...

516
00:26:04,014 --> 00:26:06,642
naughty, stupid children.

517
00:26:06,683 --> 00:26:10,771
Well, that makes me feel better
that you could admit that.

518
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:16,068
Because... when naughty children misbehave,

519
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,654
they know that they're gonna
get punished, don't they?

520
00:26:21,782 --> 00:26:22,741
Punished?

521
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:24,500
At this point,

522
00:26:24,535 --> 00:26:28,122
I'd like to point out that,
uh, it was Karl who proposed.

523
00:26:28,163 --> 00:26:29,838
Karl.

524
00:26:29,873 --> 00:26:33,585
You are gonna throw me an elaborate wedding.

525
00:26:33,627 --> 00:26:36,380
Yes, of course.

526
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:39,258
Anything, baby.

527
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,767
How elaborate?

528
00:26:41,802 --> 00:26:45,389
Well, figure out exactly what
it is that you could afford,

529
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,932
and triple it.

530
00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:52,146
- As for you...
- Okay, now remember, I'm broke.

531
00:26:52,187 --> 00:26:54,481
I'm well aware of your church mouse status.

532
00:26:54,523 --> 00:26:58,360
I don't intend to lift a finger

533
00:26:58,402 --> 00:27:00,529
during the planning and execution

534
00:27:00,571 --> 00:27:04,575
of this crushingly expensive wedding.

535
00:27:04,616 --> 00:27:06,577
No. No, of course not.

536
00:27:06,618 --> 00:27:09,163
And anything I can do to help...

537
00:27:09,204 --> 00:27:11,707
uh, you know, I would...
I could help with the engagement party.

538
00:27:11,742 --> 00:27:12,833
How's that?

539
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:16,587
Well, I wasn't planning on inviting you.

540
00:27:16,628 --> 00:27:18,297
But...

541
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:20,007
I will need a bartender.

542
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,552
Oh, oh, and, um...

543
00:27:23,594 --> 00:27:26,096
make sure you come in through the back door.

544
00:27:34,938 --> 00:27:37,483
You're just in time.

545
00:27:37,524 --> 00:27:42,821
Mrs. Scavo has been sworn in,
so we're all ready to start.

546
00:27:42,863 --> 00:27:43,822
Hey.

547
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:45,908
Hi.

548
00:27:52,748 --> 00:27:55,042
All right, we are now on the record.

549
00:27:55,077 --> 00:27:57,336
Okay.

550
00:27:57,377 --> 00:28:00,464
Isn't it true that while your
children were in Bree's care,

551
00:28:00,506 --> 00:28:01,965
that she passed out drunk

552
00:28:02,007 --> 00:28:06,136
and allowed them to wander off
to a downtown business district?

553
00:28:10,432 --> 00:28:14,978
My kids don't wander. They scurry, like rats.

554
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,315
- Excuse me?
- Do you know a rat can fit through a hole

555
00:28:18,357 --> 00:28:19,817
the size of a quarter?

556
00:28:19,858 --> 00:28:22,820
Anyway, my children have
that trick down, too.

557
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:24,404
Mrs. Scavo, are you saying

558
00:28:24,446 --> 00:28:26,573
that you don't hold Mrs.
Van De Kamp responsible

559
00:28:26,608 --> 00:28:28,575
for endangering your children?

560
00:28:28,617 --> 00:28:30,911
No, I don't hold her responsible.

561
00:28:30,953 --> 00:28:34,373
Bree Van De Kamp and I have
known each other a long time.

562
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:35,839
I trust her completely.

563
00:28:35,874 --> 00:28:38,001
She's a wonderful friend
and a fantastic mother.

564
00:28:38,043 --> 00:28:41,004
She puts the rest of us to shame.

565
00:28:41,046 --> 00:28:44,049
She's lying! Are you gonna let
her get away with this crap?

566
00:28:44,091 --> 00:28:46,093
Please.

567
00:28:47,594 --> 00:28:50,722
Do you consider Mrs. Van De
Kamp to have a drinking problem?

568
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:53,725
No.

569
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:56,228
Then why did you line empty wine bottles

570
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,938
up on her front stoop?

571
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,567
I was helping Bree with her recycling.

572
00:29:01,608 --> 00:29:03,819
Do I need to remind you

573
00:29:03,861 --> 00:29:06,447
of the potential consequences of perjury?

574
00:29:06,488 --> 00:29:10,659
No, you don't. In fact, I hate liars.

575
00:29:30,554 --> 00:29:31,513
Hello?

576
00:29:31,555 --> 00:29:34,683
Peter. Hi, it's Bree.

577
00:29:34,725 --> 00:29:36,310
Hey, Bree.

578
00:29:36,351 --> 00:29:39,021
You know, um, if you feel like
you're gonna need a drink,

579
00:29:39,062 --> 00:29:40,689
you should call Donna.

580
00:29:40,731 --> 00:29:43,692
No! No, I-I don't feel like I'm gonna drink.

581
00:29:43,734 --> 00:29:45,778
And if I did, I certainly would call Donna.

582
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:49,281
I mean, she and I are just...
we're just really clicking.

583
00:29:49,323 --> 00:29:51,450
Oh, that's good. So why are you calling?

584
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:54,369
I know it's really late notice,
but a friend of mine, uh,

585
00:29:54,411 --> 00:29:56,336
got engaged and she's throwing a party,

586
00:29:56,371 --> 00:29:58,373
and I thought, um, maybe you'd like to come.

587
00:29:58,408 --> 00:30:01,585
- Bree...
- Well, you're not my sponsor anymore,

588
00:30:01,627 --> 00:30:03,962
so I assume this is allowable.

589
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:06,138
I mean, it's just a casual get-together.

590
00:30:06,173 --> 00:30:09,092
And they're having sushi.
You do like sushi, don't you?

591
00:30:09,134 --> 00:30:10,093
Bree...

592
00:30:15,474 --> 00:30:19,144
Okay, Peter, I just really...

593
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:21,021
need us to be friends.

594
00:30:21,063 --> 00:30:23,023
When I'm with you, I'm not myself,

595
00:30:23,065 --> 00:30:24,274
which is a good thing.

596
00:30:24,316 --> 00:30:27,152
I can... I can relax when I'm with you

597
00:30:27,194 --> 00:30:30,656
in a way that I can't
when I'm with other people.

598
00:30:31,949 --> 00:30:34,952
With them, I have to pretend
that I have it all together,

599
00:30:34,993 --> 00:30:37,371
but...

600
00:30:37,412 --> 00:30:40,541
you know that I don't, so
it's just so much easier.

601
00:30:40,576 --> 00:30:42,793
Come on, it's just a...

602
00:30:42,835 --> 00:30:44,795
it's just a dumb old party.

603
00:30:44,837 --> 00:30:46,880
Bree...

604
00:30:46,922 --> 00:30:48,590
do not call me again.

605
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:56,682
Oh!

606
00:30:56,723 --> 00:30:58,808
Paul! I am so glad you made it.

607
00:30:58,843 --> 00:31:00,894
I appreciate the invitation, Edie.

608
00:31:00,936 --> 00:31:03,063
Although, frankly, I'm a
little surprised to get it

609
00:31:03,105 --> 00:31:05,441
considering how people in this
neighborhood feel about me.

610
00:31:05,482 --> 00:31:09,403
Oh. You know me. I like to be inclusive.

611
00:31:09,445 --> 00:31:10,904
Ooh! It's heavy.

612
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:15,325
Uh, unh-unh. This is flat.

613
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,619
I think I'd like, um...

614
00:31:17,661 --> 00:31:19,121
a Rusty Nail.

615
00:31:19,163 --> 00:31:20,789
A what now?

616
00:31:20,831 --> 00:31:21,999
It's a cocktail,

617
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,709
well, I'm not really sure what's in it.

618
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:27,463
But it sounds obscure and
complicated, so chop-chop.

619
00:31:28,672 --> 00:31:30,549
Be right there.

620
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:32,641
Hey, hey. Put that down. We gotta go.

621
00:31:32,676 --> 00:31:35,436
- Our birth mother just went into labor.
- What?

622
00:31:35,471 --> 00:31:39,016
- That's fantastic!
- Yeah, can you believe it?
We're gonna be parents.

623
00:31:39,057 --> 00:31:41,059
I'll go get the car. Come on.

624
00:31:41,101 --> 00:31:43,020
We were supposed to have four weeks.

625
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:46,064
She promised to me the baby wasn't
due for four more weeks.

626
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:48,525
We don't have anything! We don't...
we don't have diapers,

627
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:50,861
and we don't have the stuff babies drink.

628
00:31:50,903 --> 00:31:53,154
- Formula.
- Exactly. We're not ready.

629
00:31:54,072 --> 00:31:56,408
You know, this is a total inconvenience.

630
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:00,078
Welcome to parenthood. Come on.

631
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,080
This is your father's bartender bible.

632
00:32:02,122 --> 00:32:05,125
- See if you can find a
recipe for a Rusty Nail.
- Okay.

633
00:32:10,422 --> 00:32:11,507
Um, Mom?

634
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:16,553
Where'd you find that?

635
00:32:16,595 --> 00:32:20,808
It was stuck in here between
a Pink Squirrel and a Pisco Sour.

636
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:23,227
Oh.

637
00:32:23,268 --> 00:32:26,730
Well, why is your father keeping this?

638
00:32:26,772 --> 00:32:29,233
Why do you think?

639
00:32:37,282 --> 00:32:38,909
Hey, Susie.

640
00:32:38,951 --> 00:32:40,410
Karl, this marriage...

641
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:41,912
our marriage, this fake marriage,

642
00:32:41,954 --> 00:32:44,164
that's what it is, right? Fake.

643
00:32:44,206 --> 00:32:45,707
What are you talking about?

644
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:48,043
What's this?

645
00:32:48,085 --> 00:32:49,628
Nothing.

646
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,005
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

647
00:32:52,047 --> 00:32:56,677
Okay, then, repeat after me.

648
00:32:56,718 --> 00:32:58,178
"Our marriage is fake,

649
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,848
"and I'm going to marry
the woman I really love...

650
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:02,224
Edie Britt."

651
00:33:02,266 --> 00:33:04,351
If that's what you want me to say.

652
00:33:04,393 --> 00:33:07,229
No, no, no, no! It's not about
what I want you to say.

653
00:33:07,271 --> 00:33:12,693
You have to want to say
that you want to marry Edie.

654
00:33:12,734 --> 00:33:14,840
Don't worry about this, Susie.

655
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:16,947
Why are you hanging on to that?

656
00:33:16,989 --> 00:33:19,283
I need to look at it from time to time.

657
00:33:19,324 --> 00:33:20,492
Why?

658
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,541
Consider it my punishment.

659
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:31,253
For screwing up the best thing
that ever happened to me.

660
00:33:33,338 --> 00:33:38,218
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.
This is not happening.

661
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,936
No, wha... mmm. Mmm!

662
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:43,515
Oh, Karl! Oh! Will you...

663
00:33:43,557 --> 00:33:46,143
- Are you crazy?!
- Just tell me what to do, Susie.

664
00:33:46,178 --> 00:33:48,103
If you want me to marry Edie, I will.

665
00:33:48,145 --> 00:33:50,939
You want me to call off
the wedding, I'll do it.

666
00:33:50,981 --> 00:33:53,400
I'll do whatever you want.
I'm putty.

667
00:33:53,442 --> 00:33:55,277
Karl! Whoa!

668
00:33:57,905 --> 00:33:59,371
What are you doing?

669
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:02,951
I'm, just, uh, putting away some coats.

670
00:34:02,993 --> 00:34:04,328
Oh.

671
00:34:04,369 --> 00:34:06,538
Well, it's time to open my presents.

672
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,581
Let's go.

673
00:34:24,973 --> 00:34:26,475
Oh, hello.

674
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,726
Hi.

675
00:34:27,768 --> 00:34:30,104
Hi. Um, I need some advice
from a professional.

676
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,071
I'd like to get stinking drunk.

677
00:34:32,106 --> 00:34:35,818
Do you have anything that can
accomplish that in a hurry?

678
00:34:39,947 --> 00:34:41,907
I forgot the Lamaze book in my purse!

679
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,451
Oh, forget it. Come on.
Let's go. We'll wing it.

680
00:34:47,788 --> 00:34:49,832
Oh, we missed it!

681
00:34:49,873 --> 00:34:52,251
The kid just slipped right out.

682
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:53,877
Are you family?

683
00:34:58,882 --> 00:35:00,384
They're the parents.

684
00:35:07,808 --> 00:35:10,769
Would you like to help?

685
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:12,229
No, thanks.

686
00:35:12,271 --> 00:35:15,941
You guys look like you got it covered.

687
00:35:15,976 --> 00:35:18,110
Oh, are you sure, honey?

688
00:35:18,152 --> 00:35:19,736
Come on, Gaby.

689
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:21,905
I just, um...

690
00:35:21,947 --> 00:35:23,907
I-I don't wanna do anything to screw it up.

691
00:35:23,949 --> 00:35:26,118
She won't break.

692
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,454
Here.

693
00:35:28,495 --> 00:35:29,621
Okay.

694
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:37,171
Hi.

695
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:45,012
Oh, honey, you were right.

696
00:35:45,053 --> 00:35:46,597
About what?

697
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:52,853
It was all worth it.

698
00:36:02,905 --> 00:36:05,824
Serving bowls.
Just what I needed, Lynette.

699
00:36:05,866 --> 00:36:08,786
There's a gift receipt taped
to the bottom of the box.

700
00:36:08,827 --> 00:36:10,579
Oh. Thank God!

701
00:36:12,623 --> 00:36:15,626
Okay, the next one is from Felicia.

702
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:18,086
I do hope you like it.

703
00:36:18,128 --> 00:36:20,088
Oh, you know what they say...

704
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,801
good things come in small packages.

705
00:36:28,013 --> 00:36:30,224
What is it?

706
00:36:32,643 --> 00:36:33,790
Teeth?

707
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:34,937
Dentures.

708
00:36:36,897 --> 00:36:39,775
They were my dear sister Martha's.

709
00:36:39,817 --> 00:36:42,778
I'm sure none of you knew,
but she had orthodontic issues

710
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,864
from the time she was a child.

711
00:36:45,906 --> 00:36:49,201
Oh.

712
00:36:49,243 --> 00:36:50,536
Thank you.

713
00:36:50,577 --> 00:36:54,206
I know it's an unconventional
gift for an engagement party,

714
00:36:54,241 --> 00:36:56,416
but you and Martha were
such close friends, Edie.

715
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:58,418
I wanted you to have something truly personal

716
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,920
to remember her by,

717
00:36:59,962 --> 00:37:03,340
since she left us so... abruptly.

718
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:04,807
You know,

719
00:37:04,842 --> 00:37:07,136
when Paul Young strangled
her, crushed her windpipe

720
00:37:07,177 --> 00:37:11,890
and buried her alive next to
a garbage-strewn hiking trail.

721
00:37:11,925 --> 00:37:14,560
Felicia, uh... I think you've had enough.

722
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,231
I do apologize if I've offended anyone,

723
00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:22,693
but... while you all are chitchatting

724
00:37:22,734 --> 00:37:24,987
and eating these gummy hors d'oeuvres,

725
00:37:25,028 --> 00:37:26,537
just remember...

726
00:37:26,572 --> 00:37:29,032
you're in the company of a murderer.

727
00:38:04,234 --> 00:38:07,613
Bree? Bree.

728
00:38:13,243 --> 00:38:15,329
Why didn't you call Donna?

729
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:18,582
Hmm.

730
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,418
I don't need Donna.

731
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,629
I need you.

732
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:43,357
You know, I don't even like redheads.

733
00:38:47,152 --> 00:38:48,612
Okay, it's my turn.

734
00:38:48,654 --> 00:38:51,205
Shh. In a minute.

735
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,493
Come on, you're hogging her.

736
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:57,412
Tell me! You tell
me who it is, Libby.

737
00:38:57,454 --> 00:38:58,914
Are you drunk?

738
00:38:58,956 --> 00:39:00,874
Who is he, Libby? Hmm?

739
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:03,001
I got to know.

740
00:39:03,043 --> 00:39:05,546
I already told you, he's just some rodeo guy.

741
00:39:05,587 --> 00:39:07,923
- I don't even remember his name.
- Liar!

742
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:11,844
What are you doing?

743
00:39:11,885 --> 00:39:13,595
I am gonna light myself on fire.

744
00:39:13,637 --> 00:39:16,807
He's gonna light himself
on fire with coffee liqueur?

745
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:18,684
Would not have been my choice.

746
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:21,186
Tell me his name, or I'm gonna do it!

747
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:22,938
Frank, you're being an idiot.

748
00:39:24,481 --> 00:39:26,191
It was Dale, okay? It was Dale.

749
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:28,944
Security to maternity.

750
00:39:28,986 --> 00:39:33,038
My brother Dale? He's a kid!

751
00:39:33,073 --> 00:39:35,868
Well, he's 19, Frank.
He knows which end is up.

752
00:39:35,903 --> 00:39:39,538
Wait, what is she saying?

753
00:39:39,573 --> 00:39:41,957
There's a father.

754
00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:43,167
Hey! Hey!

755
00:39:45,335 --> 00:39:46,962
- No.
- Leave me alone!

756
00:39:47,004 --> 00:39:48,630
I'm not giving up the baby.

757
00:39:48,672 --> 00:39:51,341
Let's get him out of here.

758
00:39:51,376 --> 00:39:53,093
No! No!

759
00:39:53,135 --> 00:39:54,970
Security to O.B. Security to O.B., stat.

760
00:39:55,005 --> 00:39:56,972
What the hell are you doing?

761
00:39:57,007 --> 00:39:58,439
Taking our baby home.

762
00:39:58,474 --> 00:40:00,434
She's not ours. The papers
aren't valid anymore.

763
00:40:00,476 --> 00:40:02,269
She has a father.

764
00:40:02,311 --> 00:40:04,271
Do you really wanna leave
this beautiful little girl

765
00:40:04,313 --> 00:40:06,273
with that white trash freak show?!

766
00:40:06,308 --> 00:40:07,941
Huh?

767
00:40:07,983 --> 00:40:09,735
Well, come on, then.

768
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,160
Where?

769
00:40:18,202 --> 00:40:19,828
Maternity. Maternity.

770
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,455
All right.

771
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:26,668
Hurry up!

772
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,670
I'm hurrying.

773
00:40:31,048 --> 00:40:33,300
Man, there's a lot of straps on this thing!

774
00:40:33,342 --> 00:40:36,762
- How does this thing go in?
- Read the instructions!

775
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:38,639
"Pass strap 'a' through strap 'b,'

776
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,183
making sure that the harness
clip is at chest level."

777
00:40:41,225 --> 00:40:44,186
- Well, which damn one is the harness clip?
- That is after the baby is in.

778
00:40:44,228 --> 00:40:46,146
You have to connect it to the car first!

779
00:40:46,188 --> 00:40:48,148
I told you we should've got an S.U.V.!

780
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:51,068
Okay, stop yelling! This is very complicated.

781
00:40:51,103 --> 00:40:53,070
Oh, for God's sakes. Just take the baby.

782
00:40:57,825 --> 00:41:00,327
- Wow.
- We're good to go.

783
00:41:00,369 --> 00:41:03,372
Give me the baby.

784
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,168
You know this isn't gonna end well.

785
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,672
You know, they're just gonna
try and take her back.

786
00:41:11,707 --> 00:41:15,134
Maybe. But we don't have
to make it easy for them.

787
00:41:15,175 --> 00:41:18,971
- Gaby, I...
- Look, just buckle up!

788
00:41:27,771 --> 00:41:30,566
Temptation comes to all of us.

789
00:41:30,607 --> 00:41:32,533
Whether or not we succumb

790
00:41:32,568 --> 00:41:37,427
depends on our ability
to recognize its disguise.

791
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:42,286
Sometimes it arrives in
the form of an old flame,

792
00:41:42,327 --> 00:41:44,997
flickering back to life.

793
00:41:46,707 --> 00:41:48,375
Or a new friend

794
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:52,504
who could end up being so much more.

795
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:57,933
Or a young child

796
00:41:57,968 --> 00:42:03,056
who awakens feelings we didn't know we had.

797
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:08,708
And so we give in to temptation,

798
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:12,775
all the while knowing come morning,

799
00:42:12,816 --> 00:42:15,535
we'll have to suffer the consequences.
