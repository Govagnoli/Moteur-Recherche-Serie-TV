00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,150
previously on Desperate Housewives

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,240
I'm gonna die,

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,900
and I'd like to know
what happened to my daughterbefore I do.

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,890
When it comes to wisteria lane,

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,810
there are old crimes...

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,210
new crimes...

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,330
as soon as it gets dark,we get rid
of that body.

8
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,580
And crimes that are happening...

9
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,360
right under everyone's nose.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,390
I'm thinkingit's the applewhites.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,980
Jim halverson was aware
that he had little to offer a woman.

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,790
He was neither rich,nor smart,nor handsome.

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,820
Are you jim?I'm susan mayer.

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,610
So when his friend set him up on a blind date
with a beautiful stranger...

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,050
wow,you're so much hotterthan nikki said you'd be.

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,780
How old are you?

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,380
How olddo you think I am?

18
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,610
Jim made the tragic decision to try to be funny.

19
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,830
Not a day over 50.

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,840
why don't weget our table?

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,680
Well,no,see,that was funny,

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,600
because you'reso obviously not 50.

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,500
That's why I said 50,'cause it's absurd.

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,220
Jim did everything he could to get
susan mayer to laugh.

25
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,270
He tried racial humor...

26
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,250
so guess what time chinesepeople
go to the dentist?

27
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,880
2:30.

28
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,210
uh,get it?"Tooth-hurty?"

29
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,080
Tooth-hurty.

30
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,660
I love that.

31
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,280
He tried to be engagingly risqu?..

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,340
rectum?Damn near killed him!

33
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,770
you know whata rectum is,right?

34
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,190
he even tried gentle teasing.

35
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,190
No,no,you see,by comparing you to a nazi,

36
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,550
I was making the pointthat you're
so not a nazi.

37
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,820
-You're like the--
-and just when jim

38
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,540
thought the date couldn't get any worse....

39
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,570
...It did.

40
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,460
Okay,jim,I need you to look up...

41
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,030
and down.

42
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,100
All right,so,how did this happen?

43
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,180
It was an accident.

44
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,420
Oh,I don't knowabout that.

45
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,520
In some cultureshead-butting is
a mating ritual.

46
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,980
Dr. Mccready,can italk to you
about my head?

47
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,390
Away from...the draft?

48
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,610
you can call medr. Ron. Everyone does.

49
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,150
dr. Ron...

50
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,100
I need you to pretendthere's something
wrong with me and admit me for the night.

51
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,040
I'm sorry?

52
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,180
This is the worst dateI have ever
been on in my life.

53
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,260
That man is the most obnoxious,
offensive,annoying human being.

54
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,030
And you're looking at melike
I'm crazy right now,

55
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,860
but I will be if I spendone more
second with him.

56
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,600
So you gotta help me.You gotta do something.

57
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,560
It's my mental health.My mental health!

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,140
You took an oath.

59
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,260
Could you let goof my lapel,please?

60
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,040
Oh,sorry.

61
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,220
Um,listen,I'm sorryyour date's
not going well.

62
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,460
But I can'tadmit you,susan.

63
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,180
Right. Right.

64
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Jim,let's,uh,let's takea look at
those reflexes.

65
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,890
Okay,I got a jokefor you,doctor.

66
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,420
What's the correct medical term
for the circumcisionof a rabbit?

67
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,000
Hare cut.

68
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,720
I don't--I always--

69
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,420
jim,I'm gonna needto keep you here
for awhile,run some tests.

70
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,550
Really? I--

71
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,530
yeah,I'm still worried about
that bump on your head here.

72
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,060
That's still...

73
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,510
and,susan,

74
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,440
you're good to go.

75
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,590
And though it only lasted a moment,

76
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,540
jim caught the look that passed
between his date...

77
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,330
and his doctor.

78
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,940
Thank you so much,dr. Ron.

79
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,410
And he suddenly got the feeling

80
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,460
the joke was on him.

Desperate Housewives
Season 02 Episode 12

84
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,570
The annual blood drive was
a tradition on wisteria lane.

85
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,820
Most residents came to help
promote health and well-being,

86
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,320
but my friends turned up
for a different reason.

87
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,070
They were growing
increasingly concerned

88
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,980
that their street was infected
with a dangerous kind of sickness.

89
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:47,340
And they came to consult
with one another about a possible cure.

90
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,020
great,
she caught me staring.

91
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,660
Have you guys noticed
how friendly betty's been

92
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,630
since that body was found
in front of her house?

93
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,150
I don't trust
friendly women.

94
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,240
That's okay.
They don't trust you,either.

95
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,610
I just know those two have
something to do with that dead body.

96
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,270
Do we even know
who he is?

97
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,270
Well,the paper said the police
are withholding the details.

98
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,010
Bree,maybe you should call in a favor
from your police detective pal,

99
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,780
have him poke around.

100
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,260
That's a great idea.

101
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,670
You could have him do a background
check on the applewhites.

102
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,710
I don't think
I can do that.

103
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,350
Why not?
You said he was nice.

104
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,440
Well,once he stopped suspecting me of
murdering rex he was delightful,but,um...

105
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,420
I don't really know him.

106
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,690
Well,somebody has to do something,
'cause I'm losing sleep.

107
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,110
Betty! Matthew.

108
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,280
Hello,everybody.

109
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,200
Susan,a little birdie told me
you're having a birthday soon.

110
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,410
We should all go out
and celebrate.

111
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,040
Super.

112
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,150
Sounds like a plan.

113
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,130
Count me in.

114
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,080
bye.

115
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,200
See ya.

116
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,210
So why are you everybody's
best friend all of a sudden?

117
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,450
If there was ever
a time to be neighborly,

118
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,790
this is it.

119
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,280
We're idiots for staying here.

120
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,650
I mean,we should've hit the road
as soon as they found monroe's body.

121
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,150
I mean,how do we know he didn't tell
foster where we're hiding?

122
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,550
Because if he had,foster
would've shown up by now.

123
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,110
And besides,if we take off,
what are we gonna live on?

124
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,000
I have all of our money
tied up in this house.

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,470
So why not
just sell it?

126
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,980
Patience,matthew.

127
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,370
If we take off right away,

128
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,880
it'll look suspicious.

129
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,670
Now what we need
is a story--

130
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,580
a reason for us to move.

131
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,930
Look at this,a-b negative.

132
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,520
Yeah,it's the rarest
of all blood types.

133
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,680
Well,there must be something
in the water around these parts.

134
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,690
You're my second
a-b negative today.

135
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,810
Seriously?

136
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,330
Uh,who was it?

137
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,510
That guy.

138
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,230
Hi,bree.

139
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,290
Oh,hi.

140
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,670
I just wanted to thank you
for your advice on my azaleas.

141
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,160
They're just thriving.

142
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,940
Oh,it was
no trouble at all.

143
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,120
Such a shame I may not
be around to enjoy them.

144
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,350
Well,my mother has taken ill.

145
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,710
And matthew and I,

146
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,450
we'll probably go and visit her.

147
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,550
We may even be moving.

148
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,320
We just don't know yet.

149
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,260
Oh,well,
where does she live?

150
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,100
Oh,back in chicago.

151
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,860
Is it serious?

152
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,520
I-I don't know yet.

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,900
Well,obviously,I'll be
speaking with her doctor.

154
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,050
Oh,betty,if there's anything I can do,
anything at all...

155
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,500
thank you.

156
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,810
You've already
done so much.

157
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,240
Bye.

158
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,870
That dr. Ron called.

159
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,970
He needs to see you
for a follow-up appointment.

160
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,160
He needs to see me
or he wants to see me?

161
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,190
Jeez,mom,how cute
is this guy?

162
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,610
Oh,he could be cuter...

163
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,800
but I don't know how.

164
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,360
So ask him out.

165
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,710
Oh,no,
I can't do that.

166
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,420
Mom,he's a cute surgeon.
What's the problem?

167
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,040
He's young.

168
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,460
Young?

169
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,040
Younger than me.

170
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,430
How much younger?

171
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,690
Let's just say if I was
a senior in high school,

172
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,560
I'd be saying,"wow,
you're a hot fifth grader."

173
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,260
Oh,well,of course it's gonna sound
gross if you say it that way.

174
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,070
But you're both adults.So why not
just ask him out?

175
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,430
'Cause the conversation
could go something like this,

176
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,020
"dr. Ron,I think you're hot."

177
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,750
"Oh,well,thank you,ma'am.

178
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,750
"Now I think it's time we talk
about your hip replacement."

179
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,760
Mom,you're hot

180
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,050
and funny and nice.

181
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,400
And... clearly desperate,
and guys are into that.

182
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,240
Play to your strengths.

183
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,020
Thank god you're home.

184
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,000
What's wrong? Pat said youtold 
her it was an emergency!

185
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,060
The boys weresent home from school.

186
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,650
What? Why? I called.The machine kept picking up.

187
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,360
I know. I know.Look,I...

188
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,170
they've got chicken pox.

189
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,120
Chicken pox?That's the emergency?

190
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,760
They'retotally contagious.

191
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,980
Not to us.

192
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,800
They are to me!I've never had it.

193
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,310
Well,you nevertold me that.

194
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,880
You know,the point is,I can't go in there.

195
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,420
It's a hot zone.

196
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,560
Well,tom,somebody'sgotta take care
of our kids.

197
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,670
Exactly.

198
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,280
And since you're immune--

199
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,380
oh,you've gotta be kidding!I have
to get back to work!

200
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,260
Just for a couple of days,until
they're not contagious.

201
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,640
It is not the ebola virus.It's chicken pox.

202
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,500
You are being a baby.

203
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,880
Yes,I am.

204
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,790
Okay.

205
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,950
And if you thinkI'm being a baby now,

206
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,970
do I need to remind youof what
I'm like when I'm sick?

207
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,470
Remember that timeI had strep throat?

208
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,640
We wound upin marriage counseling.

209
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,810
I'll call the office.

210
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,200
Thanks,honey.

211
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,890
Uh,mrs. Solis,I gotta talk to you.

212
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,500
Ralph,if this is about luis
overwateringthe hydrangeas again,

213
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,530
I told you,
no one likes a tattletale.

214
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,830
My wife left me.

215
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,370
Oh,I'm sorry.

216
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,220
I didn't know you and bonitawere
having problems.

217
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,320
We weren't.

218
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,920
Uh,it was all of a sudden.
She just packed her bagsand left.

219
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,350
She said I have an illness,
and I need to get help.

220
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,330
Why?

221
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,930
There's nothingwrong with me.I just
like to look atpretty ladies on the internet.

222
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,620
And sure,they're not always dressed,

223
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,600
and sometimes,there's more than one.

224
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,390
But I only go tothe classy web sites.

225
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,070
There's some really sick stuffout there,
mrs. Solis.

226
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:28,940
Ralph!

227
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,260
Make your point.

228
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,480
Um,last night,uh,I found this new web site.

229
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,860
And there wasa picture of a lady
sitting on a bearskin rug

230
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,160
with nothing on except for a little
pointyelf hat. It was very festive.

231
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,650
Uh,ralph,why are youtelling me this?

232
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,040
I'm sorry.It's just,um...

233
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,440
ahem. I think you reallyneed to see this.

234
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,340
Oh,my god!

235
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,680
The lighting looks greaton you,mrs. Solis.

236
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,990
I mean,most of the time,you have to squint
at the screen to see anything really good.

237
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,700
And not here,no,sir,that's good.

238
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,730
Well,um,thank you,ralph,
for bringing thisto my attention.

239
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,830
Uh,mrs. Solis,I was wondering...

240
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,790
would you sign that for me?

241
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,240
Oh,okay.

242
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,740
where have you been?

243
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,100
Why didn't you cometo see me?

244
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,380
I came every sunday.

245
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,800
You were just too out of it to
know I was here.

246
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,120
I think you're lying.

247
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,710
But then again,these days,
I think everyone'sbeen lying to me.

248
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,070
The thing is,you're here now.

249
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,750
So tell mewhat I wanna know.

250
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,030
Did you find the manwho killed my daughter?

251
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,370
It was a guy namedtodd forrest--

252
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,370
this lowlife drug dealer.

253
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,160
He got her hooked again.

254
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,180
She tried to steal from him,and he killed her.

255
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,140
And I killed him.

256
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,780
I thought hearing thatwould make you happy.

257
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,370
I thought it would,too.

258
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,120
But it doesn't.

259
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,560
I'm sorry.

260
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,930
I wanna start your I.V.,But your
veins are kinda bad.

261
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,800
Well,here,let me help you.

262
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,320
What the hellare you doing?

263
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,540
You're crazy!

264
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,060
You're fired.Get out.

265
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,720
So I guesswe're done then?

266
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,050
Yeah.

267
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,530
You,uh...

268
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,040
you gonna come see me again?

269
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
You planning on havingan open casket?

270
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,090
Hey,guys.

271
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,750
Hi,lynette.

272
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,000
Hi,carlos.

273
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,710
All right! A reuben?How sweet is that?

274
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,810
Lunch brought rightto the golf course.

275
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,880
I hear you got somepretty
sick kids in there.

276
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,320
Oh,it's justchicken pox.

277
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,330
But braveheart here will onlycome
in to sleep and shower.

278
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,670
I can't say I blame him.

279
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,220
I wouldn't want to beshooting blanks either.

280
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,390
Be well,my man,

281
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,320
Bye,lynette.

282
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,590
See you later.

283
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,300
I'm sorry,what did he mean,"shooting blanks"?

284
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,870
Oh,it's nothing.

285
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,340
There's justa small chance

286
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,070
of sterility if a grown mangets
chicken pox,so...

287
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,890
we're not having any more kids.
Why would it matter?

288
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,780
I don't know.You know,survival instinct?

289
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,770
So that if you're the last manto
survive a nuclear holocaust,

290
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,650
you could repopulatethe planet?

291
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,330
No,all I'm saying is that,

292
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,440
god forbid something wereto
happen to either one of us,

293
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,370
I'd want either one of usto have,you know,options.

294
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,620
So you're sayingthat if I died...

295
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,880
you would want a second wifeand a family?

296
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Maybe.

297
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,380
I can't believe you'veactually
thought about this!

298
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,540
Haven't you?

299
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,040
Thought about who I'd marryif you died?

300
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,490
Hmm. No.

301
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,560
Well,honey,it's a back-upplan.
I'm not gonna use it.

302
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,900
Then why have it?

303
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,920
Well,I don't know,because...

304
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,540
it's like,there's this door,right?

305
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,350
And I'm not planning on
actuallygoing through it

306
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,060
because I'm so happyin the room
that I'm in.

307
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,690
But in case of fire or flood,

308
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,870
it's comforting to knowthat
the door is unlocked.

309
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,590
Honey,I'm notthrough with that!

310
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:18,840
Yeah,well,why don't you have your
second wifemake you lunch,okay? Oops!

311
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,040
You...

312
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,440
bree,uh,

313
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,300
I have to say,I was,uh,

314
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,170
I was very pleasedto get your call.

315
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,810
I mean,I'm surprised you'd wantto
have anything to do with me

316
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,200
given our recent history.

317
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,060
Oh,you mean your having suspected me
of murdering my husband?

318
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,780
Detective,that is allwater under
the bridge now.

319
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,590
I am very gladto hear you say that.

320
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,550
Although,I have to confess,I do
have an ulterior motive.

321
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,570
I need to ask you a favor.

322
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,480
Oh,well,shoot,whatever I can do.

323
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,920
We have these,um,new neighbors--
the applewhites.

324
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,880
It's a mother and her son. They
just moved here from chicago.

325
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,090
And they seem very nice.
But there's--

326
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,210
there's something about themthat'S...

327
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,420
off.

328
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,510
They're...

329
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,110
odd.

330
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,060
Odd?

331
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,140
Yeah,they're secretiveand watchful.

332
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,500
And there was a dead bodyfound
in front of their house.

333
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,410
I can't run a background checkon
your neighbors for being odd.

334
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,840
Is that why youwanted to see me? To--

335
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,350
to ask me that?

336
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,410
Yeah,why?

337
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,040
Well,I just--during the investigation,

338
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,410
I just thought there wasa kind of a,um...

339
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,480
spark between us.

340
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,500
You know,I thoughtthis might be a date.

341
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,900
Uh,no.

342
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,220
I just wanted to ask you a favor.

343
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,890
Fine,no harm done.

344
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,950
When do I ever getto have lunch
with sucha lovely lady anyway?

345
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,740
Date or...

346
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,220
no date.

347
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,380
Are you sure that you can'tcheck
on the applewhites?

348
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,320
I mean,I just knowthat there's
something there.

349
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,380
And,you know,I havea sixth sense
about people.

350
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,100
And yet,you got engaged to the man
who murdered your husband.

351
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,300
Well,your blood pressurelooks fine.

352
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,130
You're free to go,mrs. Mayer.

353
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,690
You mean,I'm notgonna see dr. Ron?

354
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,290
Well,I do the follow-up exams.

355
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,630
Dr. Ron only comes inif there's a problem.

356
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,010
Oh,well,maybe I shouldgo ahead
and see him anyway,

357
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,330
just to be safe.

358
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,170
I'm sorry.

359
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,630
Dr. Ron's scheduleis very tight today.

360
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,970
So unless you'rehaving a serious problem...

361
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,290
you're experiencing nausea,
chills and tingling,huh?

362
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,280
Yeah,

363
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,590
but nowthat I think about it,

364
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,160
I bet it's justall the coffee I drink.

365
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,110
I drink way too much coffee.

366
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,170
Do you liketo drink coffee?

367
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,490
Uh,no.No.

368
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,810
So the tingling is inyour fingers
and your toes?

369
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,550
I should switch to juice.I know
the best juice place.

370
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,000
You would love it.Do you drink juice?

371
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,740
Susan,how oftenhave you been having
these involuntary muscle spasms?

372
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,030
Oh,oh,not that often.

373
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,910
I probably just needa good massage.

374
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,470
Susan?

375
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,710
Yeah?

376
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,710
I wanna get you infor an M.R.I.

377
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,650
no,I don't thinkthat's necessary.

378
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,780
Are you a doctor?

379
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,330
I got high marksin math and science.

380
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,420
I wanna get you infor an M.R.I.

381
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,630
No,no,no,I think giventhe misunderstanding

382
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,170
that I should get the bill.

383
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,140
I won't hear of it.

384
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,340
All right,

385
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,870
we'll split it.

386
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,450
Fair enough.

387
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,970
You know what?

388
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,460
Let me,uh,let megive you a ride home.

389
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,990
Detective barton,is this somesort of high
school ployto get me back to your place?

390
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:56,350
I just don't thinkyou should be
driving a car.You've been drinking.

391
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,390
I had two glasses of wine.

392
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,260
Three,plus the tawny portwith dessert.

393
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,140
It's all here on the bill

394
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,780
if you wanna take a look.

395
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,800
You know what?

396
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,330
I politely rejected you,

397
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,930
and now you're getting your revenge
by embarrassing me.

398
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,420
You've had too much to drink.
Give me your keys.

399
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,730
I am not giving you anything.

400
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,290
Except the bill.

401
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,100
what do you thinkyou're doing?

402
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,420
I followed you to make sureyou were okay.

403
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,000
You were weaving.

404
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,880
Please step outof the car.

405
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,280
Oh,you can't be serious.

406
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,970
Out.

407
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,960
Detective,I am not drunk,and
I am not stupid.

408
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,610
I know exactlywhat this is all about.

409
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,890
I'm gonna need you to takea sobriety test.

410
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,950
A sobriety test? I'm nottaking
any sobriety...

411
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,000
test.

412
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,680
This behavior stems fromthe hurt feelings
of a man withvery low self-esteem.

413
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,800
The worldis a big place,

414
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,270
and I'm sure there isa woman out
there somewhere who'll respond to your

415
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,760
macho posturing.

416
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,490
Well...

417
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,620
here's hoping.

418
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,440
Baby,what you're about to see

419
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,250
will most likely shockand upset you.

420
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,860
Okay.

421
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,270
Remember scott,the photographer
I was dating when we met?

422
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,980
The one I dumped for you,

423
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,910
who never really got over it
and who I always said

424
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,280
was gonna get back at me?

425
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,610
Oh,carlos,I love you so much.

426
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,790
Move.

427
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,950
What is this?

428
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,640
Scott's web site,

429
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,240
with pictures of me on it.

430
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,110
well,say something.

431
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,240
Oh,my god.

432
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,850
It wassupposed to be funny--

433
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,660
a naughty little christmas gift
for my boyfriend.

434
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,890
Oh,my god!

435
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,430
I know,I was freakishlyflexible back then.

436
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,610
I'm sorry!

437
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,630
Look,what are we gonna doabout this?

438
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,680
I guessI'll call my lawyers.

439
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,610
I gave these pictures to himas a gift.
He owns them.

440
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,060
Then I guesswe're screwed.

441
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,620
Not necessarily.

442
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,970
See,here's what I'm thinking--

443
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,860
scott's a coward,

444
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,440
so you could totallyput the scare into him.

445
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,870
All you gotta dois go and rough him up,

446
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,190
and he'll take my picturesoff
the web site like that.

447
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,150
I'm sorry,but thisis your mistake.

448
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,040
You're gonna have tofix it yourself.

449
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,120
And I would love to,

450
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,230
but I have the upper bodystrength
of a kitten.

451
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,460
I need a brute!

452
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,290
Gaby,

453
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:15,560
I am just now starting
to get my rage issuesunder control.

454
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,590
This brute doesn't swingthat way anymore,

455
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,890
so go find another.

456
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,570
Well,when you left prison,
did they leave youa contact list?

457
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,880
So is dr. Ron gonnabe here for this?

458
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,190
Oh,yeah,yeah,yeah.

459
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,900
Uh,there's a hookon the wall there

460
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,470
so go aheadand get your stuff hung up

461
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,210
and,uh,just get comfy. Dr. Ronshould
be here pretty soon.

462
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,410
Okay.Okay.

463
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,880
is she tryingto put on the dust cover?

464
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,610
yep.

465
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,720
How long are we gonna let this go on?

466
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,430
Just a fewmore minutes.

467
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,790
Hi,uh,susan?

468
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,280
It's dr. Ron.

469
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,300
You don't have toget undressed for this.

470
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,850
Oh,uh,I-I,uh...

471
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,630
then why did youput out a gown?

472
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,700
No,no,it's not a gown.

473
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,440
It's the dust coverfor the M.R.I. Machine.

474
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,350
This should takeabout 45 minutes.

475
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,910
Now I know it's really crampedand
uncomfortable in there,

476
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,190
but try not to move.

477
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,550
Susan,I realizethat this whole process
must be troubling for you.

478
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,030
Yeah,it's prettytroubling.

479
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,200
Well,we're gonna getto the bottom of this.

480
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,980
And I'll be herefor you,okay?

481
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,820
Hey,dr. Ron?

482
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,020
I just have a feeling
that everything'sgonna turn out fine.

483
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,650
And when it does...

484
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,710
I'd like to buy you dinner

485
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,660
to celebrate my health.

486
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,020
You know,I was thinkingmaybe italian?

487
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,800
Oh,what the heck,

488
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,810
maybe we can call it a date.

489
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,760
If you like.

490
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,020
Dr. Ron?

491
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,150
uh,he left awhile ago.

492
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,340
He got a phone callfrom his girlfriend.

493
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,580
Okay.

494
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,230
Thank you.

495
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,320
I'd liketo get out now.

496
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,550
Try not to move.

497
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,730
good morning,luis,ralph.

498
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,230
-good morning,mrs. Solis.
-good morning,mrs. Solis.

499
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,840
Good morning,honey.

500
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,860
Hey,you're talkingto me again.

501
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,460
Well,I thoughtabout what you said--

502
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,830
about the pictures--and you're right.

503
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,310
It was my mistake

504
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,780
and I have to live with it.

505
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,100
What the hellare you doing?!

506
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,800
I'm living with it!

507
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,780
Hey,turn aroundand keep gardening!

508
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,220
Aw,you're so mean.

509
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,780
Put your clothes on right now.

510
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,410
Why? You either careif men leer
at me or not.

511
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,470
And you made it clear thatyou don't.
So what's the point?

512
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,010
Gabrielle,I am not beatingthis
guy up for you!

513
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,340
Then you better think of anotherway to
get my pictures back.

514
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,230
Because if you don't,people on wisteria lane
are gonna be seeinga lot more of me!

515
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,110
Ralph,luis,feast your eyes!

516
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,880
My finger!

517
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,080
I'll find it!

518
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,370
Aah,my finger!

519
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,460
It's gotta be here somewhere.

520
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,460
I'll look for it,man.

521
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,100
Don't worry,man.

522
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,760
-I'll find it.Oh,
-my finger!

523
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,100
Hey,honey,

524
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,920
good news.

525
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,660
I checked on penny,

526
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,660
and she didn't scream.

527
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,970
I think she's getting usedto the mask.

528
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,100
I don't want youto have options,tom.

529
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:40,430
If I die,I wanna hearyour life would be over.

530
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,270
I want you to spendthe rest of 
your life screaming,

531
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,460
"it should've been meon that plane!"

532
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,280
-Plane?
-I'm assuming there was a crash.

533
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,520
It could've been something else.

534
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,390
Okay,wait,wait,wait,wait.

535
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,460
Do you have any idea

536
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,860
how painful it is to hear about you
even thinkabout your next wife and kids?

537
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,150
I could never do that!

538
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,590
I can't imagine my lifewithout you.

539
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,560
You are my everything!

540
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,910
Honey,you're my everything.

541
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,780
Okay,well,that's easy to say,

542
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,670
but I need youto show me.

543
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,200
How?

544
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,120
With a vasec to me.

545
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,700
Can't I justget you some flowers?

546
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,860
Look,it makesperfect sense.

547
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,660
We're not gonna haveany more kids.

548
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,510
And the pill just makesme bloat.
It'll be great!

549
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,420
No,okay,lynette,

550
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,160
this is crazy.

551
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,850
Oh,I know! I know!

552
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,610
But it is whatmarried people do.

553
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,900
They go out of their way to calmeach
other's irrational fears.

554
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,120
Oh,come on,tom.

555
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,040
I really need youto do this.

556
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,120
Well,okay.

557
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,750
Fine,yeah.

558
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,520
I'll make an appointment.

559
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,240
Thank you.

560
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,920
can I ask yousomethin'?

561
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,660
I'd rather you didn'T.

562
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,440
How'd you get started?

563
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,450
-Started?
-You know,

564
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,080
in the escort business?

565
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,490
I beg your pardon.

566
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,700
I bet the guys go crazywith
your whole...

567
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,060
classy,repressed thingyou
got going on,huh?

568
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,970
I mean,your skin has,like,
no pores.

569
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,790
I am not sure,but I think there
wasa compliment in there somewhere,

570
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,870
so thank you.

571
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,270
But I am not an escort.

572
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,270
How much you chargea night?

573
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,880
Look,I'M...

574
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,500
$5,000.

575
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,040
What do you have to doexactly for 5 grand?

576
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,620
All right.

577
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,220
Your bail cleared.You're free to go.

578
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,920
Your car'sat the impound lot.

579
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,900
And you can pick it upin the morning.

580
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,050
Well,how am I supposed to get
home? I don't have any money.

581
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,460
Call a friend.

582
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,830
I have been through enoughhumiliation
for one day.

583
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,120
I hope you have a bettersuggestion than that.

584
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,930
Okay,well,let me think,um...

585
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,160
walk.

586
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,640
oh,for goodness sakes!

587
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,290
bree?

588
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,760
Is everything okay?

589
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,810
Oh,oh,I'm fine.I just,um,had a flat tire.

590
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,660
It's your lucky day.

591
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,290
I'm a whizat changing tires. Hop in.

592
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,600
You know,thank you,

593
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,760
but I think it's actuallysomething
more mechanical.

594
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,480
My car has been makingjust a terrible noise.

595
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,670
Well,I have auto club.

596
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,000
Come on.

597
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,520
Actually,

598
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,900
my car has beenimpounded by the police.

599
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,200
Thanks,betty,and,um...

600
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,770
I'd appreciate itif you could keep
this little incidentto yourself.

601
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,890
I won't say a word.I swear.

602
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:31,940
Well,that's good to hear,

603
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,810
because most people on thisstreet
couldn't keep a secret

604
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,550
if their lives depended on it.

605
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,840
Well,bree,

606
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,020
even if everyone does find out,

607
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,520
it's no big deal.

608
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,440
I mean,lots of peoplehave D.U.I.S.

609
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,290
Yes,but the difference ismost of those people
were actually drunkwhen they were arrested.

610
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,810
I was not.

611
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,580
Well,of course.

612
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,580
You know,you sound likeyou
don't believe me.

613
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,990
Well,um,it's just...

614
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,640
I know you've gone througha lot lately--

615
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,880
the death of your husband,problems
with your son.

616
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:08,390
It would only be naturalif you
did self-medicate.

617
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,220
I'm sorry,but sincewhen do you know
so much aboutmy personal life?

618
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,350
Bree,

619
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,910
it's like you said--

620
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:20,060
the people on this street arenot 
great at keeping secrets.

621
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,460
Except for you.

622
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,990
You're reallygood at it.

623
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,220
I beg your pardon.

624
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,850
Well,you moved into your housein
the middle of the night.

625
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,270
God knowswhat you moved in
that you didn't wantanybody to see.

626
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,260
People hear soundscoming at all
hours from there.

627
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,400
And,oh,what was the last one?Oh,right--

628
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,100
they found a dead bodyin front of your home.

629
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,690
Everybody talks aboutthe applewhites,

630
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:44,610
but nobody can figure out
exactly what you peopleare hiding.

631
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,140
So congratulations.

632
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,370
Your secrets are safe...

633
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,510
for now.

634
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,440
Edie?

635
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,620
Hi,it's betty applewhite.

636
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,500
Yeah,I'm sorryto call you so late but,um...

637
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:18,350
I really need to meet with
youfirst thing in the morning.

638
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,580
Yes.

639
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,940
Well,I've decidedto sell my house.

640
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,460
Dr. Ron?

641
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,630
What are you doing here?

642
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,370
Uh,we need to talk.

643
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,900
And it's not the kind of talkwe
can have over the phone.

644
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,990
Oh,are you sure?

645
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:39,740
Um,becauseI would look a lot better
over the phone right now.

646
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,060
Um,susan,your,uh,your test results came back.

647
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,510
And for the life of me,I can't figure it out.

648
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,740
Now based on the--on the symptoms
you were describing--

649
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,760
symptoms?

650
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,470
Yeah,the dizziness,the tingling,
the muscle spasms,

651
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,400
the chills--it could be neurological.

652
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,490
It also could be basedon an
autoimmune disorder.

653
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:02,080
I just--frankly,I'm stumped.

654
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,430
Oh,no,no,no,no.

655
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:06,140
Hey,listen,we're gonnaget through this,okay?

656
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,930
I am so sorry.

657
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:11,900
But I'm not sick.

658
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,240
What are youtalking about?

659
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,870
your nurse wouldn'tlet me see you,and I...

660
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,580
really wanted to see you,

661
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,380
so I sort of fakedall my symptoms.

662
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,210
The dizziness,the chills,you know,
all of it.

663
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,110
Why--why would youdo something like that?

664
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,370
What the hellis wrong with you?

665
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,190
I know. I know.I feel really awful.

666
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,880
I am just not the bestat meeting men.

667
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,060
And I thought you were cute,

668
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,280
and I sort of thought that maybe
you thoughtI was cute,

669
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,080
and you're a doctor,and that's so sexy.

670
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,490
So I was up all nightworried sick

671
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,750
digging through medical books,

672
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,290
trying to figure outsome mysterious disease
that doesn't really exist?

673
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,120
Really?You were up all night?

674
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,230
Yes.

675
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,690
I don't enjoytelling people
I thinkthey're going to die.

676
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,640
Especially not
people I like.

677
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,020
You like me?

678
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,470
Yes.

679
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,650
What about your girlfriend?

680
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,310
-What girlfriend?
-The one who calledin the M.R.I. Room?

681
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,470
We had one date. She wanteda
referral to a dermatologist.

682
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,150
She's got eczema.

683
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,080
Maybe we couldgo out sometime?

684
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,710
Do you like sushi?

685
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,280
I love sushi.

686
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,780
I'm available tomorrow night.

687
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,220
No,no,no,tomorrow's no good.
I'll still be angry.

688
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,670
I should be cooled downby friday.

689
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,680
Oh,uh,friday's good.

690
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,640
Oh,there's one thing--

691
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,460
your M.R.I. Showed that you
havea wandering spleen.

692
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:38,770
A what?

693
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,810
It's a wandering spleen.
It's no big deal.

694
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,790
Sometimes the thing just
moves around in there.

695
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,940
But we'll keepan eye on it.

696
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,610
Wandering what?

697
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,460
Okay,

698
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,960
go get him,tiger.

699
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,720
I can't do it,gaby.

700
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,150
What?

701
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,950
I can't go in there.I thought I could,
but I can'T.

702
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,650
You promised!

703
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,470
Ever since I got outof prison,

704
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,180
I've been tryingto lead a better life.

705
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,440
And for the first time,I can honestly say

706
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,950
that I'm a good catholic,
and I don't want to ruin that.

707
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:20,600
So do this today and go toan
extra long mass tomorrow.

708
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,460
It doesn't workthat way.

709
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,310
Okay,

710
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,770
look,I'm really trying
to understandyour moral dilemma here,I am.

711
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,190
But if you don't getmy pictures back,

712
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,770
I'm gonna be humiliated.

713
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:34,550
You think our gardener
is the only local pervsurfing the web?

714
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,580
I'm sorry,gabrielle.

715
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,870
You used to go crazy

716
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,880
when men would so muchas
look at me the wrong way--

717
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,850
and that's whenI had clothes on.

718
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,590
I'm trying to bebetter than that now.

719
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:47,160
Or maybe you just don't love
meas much as you used to.

720
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,410
Why can't you just let mebe a good person?

721
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,570
You know,if you really loved me,

722
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,380
you wouldn't even ask meto go in there.

723
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,170
If you really loved me,
I wouldn't have to ask!

724
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,250
fine,forget it.

725
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,260
Really?

726
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,670
Be a good person.

727
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,930
Knock yourself out.

728
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,160
It's not thatI don't love you. I--

729
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,950
yeah,okay,look,let's just go home.

730
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,940
What are you doing?

731
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,140
I'm gettingyour pictures back.

732
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,080
I'm not gonna hurt him.

733
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,780
I'll talk to him,

734
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,670
appeal to his better nature.

735
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,630
Can I help you?

736
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,440
I'm carlos solis.

737
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,050
You have,uh,naked picturesof
my wife on your web site.

738
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,080
You're,uh...

739
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,050
gabrielle's husband?

740
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,400
well,you know what?
I was just aboutto take those off anyway.

741
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,400
That's great.

742
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,720
I reallyappreciate this,scott.

743
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,180
Hey,no problem.

744
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:24,350
To tell you the truth,gabrielle's pages
weren't exactly raking inthe big bucks for me.

745
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,100
I find thathard to believe.

746
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,860
I'm not saying gabrielle's nota pretty girl.

747
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,570
Of course she is.But,uh,

748
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,500
she ain't exactlyinternet pretty,you know?

749
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,660
What does that mean?

750
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,720
The web's about fantasy,not fashion.

751
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,960
I mean,guys surfingfor porn,

752
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,780
they don't care how the clothesare
hanging off the body.

753
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,300
They just wanna seethe goods. So,uh,

754
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:46,070
if little miss nastyain't rocking
some curves...

755
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,600
my wife has a perfect figure.

756
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,350
Don't get me wrong.

757
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,590
Our little gaby knows how to,uh...

758
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,670
work a runway,but,uh,

759
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,370
when it comesto cyber lovin'?

760
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,880
No real man's gonnawaste tissue on that.
There you go.

761
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,640
That's all of 'em.

762
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,060
So we cool now?

763
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,710
now that's my guy.

764
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,850
You're not limping.

765
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,120
Did everything go okay?

766
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,900
I couldn't do it.

767
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,290
What happened?

768
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,280
I don't know.
I got there,I...

769
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,400
I put on the paper gownand I,uh...

770
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,370
I just couldn't do it.

771
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,540
Why not?

772
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,690
It felt likeI was being emasculated.

773
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,300
Oh,please.

774
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:55,960
I'm serious,lynette.

775
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,790
I don't make the moneyaround here anymore.

776
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,780
I don't providefor you and the kids.

777
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,380
And I wasn't go

1
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,910
And i wasn't going to  let them snip out the l
ast thing that make me feel a man

2
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:08,520
Staying  home and taking care of the kids
doesn't make you less of a man

3
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,070
that's crazy

4
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:13,510
you expect me to calm your rational fears,

5
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,110
i expect you  to calm mine

6
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,850
Are you saying you are not happy ?

7
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,400
A little bit yeah

8
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,980
Well what we gonna do about that ?

9
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,960
i don't know

10
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,550
-can we just ?
-no,Lynette

11
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,620
I don't know

12
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:13,190
hi,it's detective barton,look i feel awful
about what happend the other day,

13
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,810
I was the jerk

14
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,100
so to make it up to you

15
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,860
I did some sniffing around about the dead man

16
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,600
they found in front of your neigbours house

17
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,010
I got some information his name is Curt Monroe

18
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,560
A private detective who lost his license
a couple years ago

19
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,080
Apparently he is from Chicago

20
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,870
I don't if this is helpful but...

21
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,330
years ago,he is apparently from Chicago

22
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,000
I,I don't know if this is helpful but

23
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,940
I just feel terrible about what happened

24
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,340
illness can take on many  forms

25
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,220
those of the body are easy to treat

26
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,070
Much more difficult

27
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,630
are the hidden maladies festering in our hearts

28
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,900
the secret diction that consume our soul

29
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,510
and the disease  we deny

30
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,750
which affect our judgement

31
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,640
To survive we need to find that special
someone who can heal us

32
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,400
I work so hard on my life,

33
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,180
so hard

34
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,980
Now it's all nothing

35
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,140
i got one daughter i hate who hates me

36
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,760
before her time

37
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,020
No one left for me now

38
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,940
What did I do it for

39
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,340
it was good i

40
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,110
did't feel a thing

41
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,950
XXXXX

42
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,010
XXXXXXXX

43
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,220
But we can never predict

44
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,920
who have the cure for what ills us

45
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,590
XXXXXXXXXXXX

46
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:10,390
or when  they'll show up

47
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,750
But I think we can get along,

48
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,310
just
