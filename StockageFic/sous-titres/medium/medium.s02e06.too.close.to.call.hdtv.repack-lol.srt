1
00:00:30,502 --> 00:00:31,382
Happy Birthday!

2
00:00:43,352 --> 00:00:44,976
Excuse me...may I help you?

3
00:01:12,802 --> 00:01:15,392
Hi...
you okay?

4
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:17,397
Yeah, yeah.

5
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:19,691
No... I'm-I'm okay.

6
00:01:19,742 --> 00:01:20,599
You sure?

7
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,900
Yeah, I'm sure.

8
00:01:24,727 --> 00:01:28,440
But I am never taking our kids to that damn arcade again.

9
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:16,472
Bridge, come on...you have to eat.

10
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:18,630
Bridgette, move it!

11
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,337
I have to get to Hannah's,and Marie has to get to day care!

12
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,708
Bridgette!

13
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:25,840
But I don't understand.

14
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:28,601
Mommy said we were going to the park today.

15
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:30,005
I don't know what to tell you, kiddo.

16
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:33,446
Mommy got a call early this morning and she had to rush to work.

17
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:35,012
So you're coming to the office with me.

18
00:02:35,063 --> 00:02:36,873
But why can't I go with Ariel?

19
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:38,926
Because you're not invited.

20
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,614
Because I'm going to Hannah's

21
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:43,060
and Hannah and I are going to dance class together.

22
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:44,141
I'm in the car.

23
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:46,195
But that's not fair.

24
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:51,893
How come school gets canceled for teachers' conferences but not dance class?

25
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,757
Probably to torture those of us who have to entertain you

26
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,736
and drive you from place to place.

27
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,875
The death of Amy Bannister is a tragedy.

28
00:03:00,274 --> 00:03:02,326
But the facts are the facts:

29
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:05,980
Ms. Bannister, after an evening of drinking and drugging,

30
00:03:06,031 --> 00:03:09,528
chose to accompany my client back to his apartment.

31
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:13,695
Unfortunately, that has now turned into a tragedy for both of them.

32
00:03:13,746 --> 00:03:17,890
And while it may titillate some people to think that something sinister happened that night,

33
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:23,716
the sad truth is that my client was fast asleep when Ms. Bannister apparently entered the bathroom,

34
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,783
slipped, cracked her head open on the shower door and summarily bled to death.

35
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:29,870
Mr. Watt...

36
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:31,153
Mr. Watt, Mr. Watt...

37
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:33,525
you said in your opening statements yesterday

38
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:36,187
that you're confident the jury will believe your client's version

39
00:03:36,238 --> 00:03:38,770
of the events and not the District Attorney's.

40
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:40,517
How can you be certain of that?

41
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:42,580
Well, my client's telling the truth.

42
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,825
Look, Damon Hodges is a throwback to a time

43
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:48,862
when the phrase "student-athlete actually meant something.

44
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:50,060
Last year,

45
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:52,928
he led his team into the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament

46
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:55,209
and made the Dean's List both semesters.

47
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:57,852
Now the District Attorney's decision to charge him

48
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:01,086
using a case that relies solely on flimsy circumstantial

49
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:04,693
evidence and hearsay smacks of election year desperation.

50
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:08,637
I mean, there's got to be a better way to boost one's name recognition

51
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:11,570
than falsely accusing our brightest and our best.

52
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:12,876
Don't you think?

53
00:04:13,126 --> 00:04:14,584
Mr. Watt, Mr. Watt...

54
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:23,125
Just a hunch, but I sense that man doesn't like you.

55
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:26,864
Unfortunately, with this particular client,he has no choice.

56
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,228
Why don't you folks go ahead in?

57
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,871
I'll join you in a minute.

58
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:36,691
Just between us,I have a witness who's about to testify

59
00:04:36,742 --> 00:04:40,794
under oath that Amy Bannister never touched a drop of alcohol in her life.

60
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:43,464
I think it will be quite clear by the time I'm through

61
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:45,653
that Mr. Wonderful drugged Ms. Bannister.

62
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:49,831
He raped her,accidentally killed her and then force-fed her alcohol to cover his tracks.

63
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:51,248
And you can prove that?

64
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:53,578
With my crack team of young turks...

65
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:55,211
Why, the Mayor nervous?

66
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,641
Well, Attorney Watt is right about it being an election year,

67
00:05:00,186 --> 00:05:03,512
and people do prefer being associated with winners.

68
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,806
Let's chat at the lunch recess.

69
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,471
It's incredible how she does that.

70
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:13,990
You don't even see her reach for the blade.

71
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:17,059
You just look down and there it is,lodged in your gut.

72
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:20,759
What is so fascinating?

73
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:23,723
Nothing. I had this crazy dream last night,

74
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,464
and she was wearing the same blouse in it.

75
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:29,614
But it's okay, you were wearing a different tie.

76
00:05:29,665 --> 00:05:33,238
So, I'm sorry, you asked me to be here early for a reason.

77
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:37,008
This young kid's something of a local celebrity,

78
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:39,024
and juries are funny with celebrities.

79
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:41,058
Sit with me today and watch 'em,

80
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:43,256
see if you can tell which way they're leaning.

81
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:45,160
That barracuda out there is right.

82
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,577
It is an election year.

83
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:50,273
If you're not getting a good feeling, I need to know that.

84
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:51,994
See if perhaps I want to cut a deal.

85
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:56,153
The government has approached 16 other design firms for bid-designs and proposals.

86
00:05:56,204 --> 00:05:58,713
My sense is, if we land this,

87
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,423
it's a small piece of a much bigger, much more lucrative pie,

88
00:06:02,474 --> 00:06:06,356
a pie that this firm would love
to ultimately get the lion's share of.

89
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:07,734
So...

90
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:14,892
let's sharpen our pencils,ladies and gentlemen,and reconvene...in 48 hours.

91
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:19,591
He's kidding, right?

92
00:06:20,411 --> 00:06:23,656
48 hours to come up with a chip that can withstand that kind of temperature,

93
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:26,154
those kind of G-forces and that atmospheric pressure?

94
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:27,485
Hey, stop griping.

95
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:29,934
Smaller, faster, cheaper -- that's what we do.

96
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:31,025
Daddy?

97
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,512
What's that thing?

98
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:36,349
What thing is that, honey?

99
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,664
That thing
you're talking about building.

100
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,040
An algorithmic microprocessor component?

101
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:46,090
Well, honey, it's...

102
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:51,064
Well, in this case,it's a little machine that the government wants to use

103
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:54,256
to help fix blurry pictures, photographs.

104
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,614
You give it a blurry photo,

105
00:06:57,165 --> 00:07:00,599
and then it tells you
what the picture's supposed to really look like.

106
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,495
Oh. Okay.

107
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,595
Junior engineer in the making.

108
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:06,408
Yes!

109
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,145
Thank you for being so good.

110
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:12,784
I know that meeting lasted a long time.

111
00:07:12,835 --> 00:07:15,245
Eh, it's okay,I was doing my picture.

112
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,996
Oh, yeah? Let's see it.

113
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,237
What is this, sweetie?

114
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:24,510
You know.

115
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:30,041
It's an al...gor... rithmic... Whatever that thing is.

116
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,830
No, no, it isn't.

117
00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:32,897
Yes, it is.

118
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:34,792
It's what you and your friends are making.

119
00:07:34,843 --> 00:07:37,338
At least that's what he thinks you're making.

120
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:38,587
No, no, he doesn't.

121
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:41,841
We're making a microprocessor.
He knows that.

122
00:07:42,726 --> 00:07:45,006
It's part of a very,very small computer.

123
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:46,945
Oh. Okay.

124
00:07:47,862 --> 00:07:50,548
Can we do the vending machine thing now?

125
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:53,208
Ms. Staley, how well do you know Ms. Bannister?

126
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:56,207
We've been roommates for over a year and a half.

127
00:07:56,348 --> 00:07:57,273
Were you close?

128
00:07:57,324 --> 00:08:00,212
I mean... some roommates barely see each other.

129
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,560
I think it would be fair to say that we considered each other best friends.

130
00:08:04,768 --> 00:08:06,549
Best friends in college, anyway.

131
00:08:06,677 --> 00:08:10,861
So when you heard that your best friend, your...best friend in college, anyway,

132
00:08:10,952 --> 00:08:13,979
had gotten drunk and allegedly slipped in a bathroom

133
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,265
and cracked her head open and then bled to death,
what was your reaction?

134
00:08:17,316 --> 00:08:18,805
Well, I knew that it was a lie--

135
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:20,456
I knew that it couldn't have happened that way.

136
00:08:20,507 --> 00:08:21,595
Objection, Your Honor.

137
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:23,676
The witness knows no such thing.

138
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:25,256
Duly noted, Counselor.

139
00:08:25,643 --> 00:08:29,309
The jury will disregard the witness's claims oftain

140
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:34,120
So... what was it about that scenario that gave you pause?

141
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:36,820
Amy didn't drink. Not at all. Not ever.

142
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:39,105
Really?
You're certain of that?

143
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:41,835
Yeah, she hated drinking; she hated drugs.

144
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:46,103
She would go to clubs because that's what college kids do,

145
00:08:46,154 --> 00:08:48,764
but she would only drink soda water.

146
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,279
If they found drugs and alcohol in her system,she didn't put them there.

147
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,217
No further questions at this time, Your Honor.

148
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:01,661
Defense counsel,your witness.

149
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:10,243
So it's your testimony, Ms. Staley,that,

150
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:11,697
to the best of your knowledge,

151
00:09:11,748 --> 00:09:13,286
Ms. Bannister didn't drink.

152
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:17,443
No. It's my testimony that Ms. Bannister didn't drink,period.

153
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,564
Look, I applaud your loyalty to your friend,

154
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,811
but the truth is, you don't know that.

155
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:24,161
- I certainly do.
- I beg to differ.

156
00:09:24,534 --> 00:09:27,802
Just because Ms. Bannister may have told you she didn't drink

157
00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:30,553
- doesn't guarantee that on occasion, she may...
- Objection.

158
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:31,593
Sustained.

159
00:09:32,057 --> 00:09:36,426
This court and the jury recognize that Ms. Staley cannot absolutely warrant

160
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:39,345
that Ms. Bannister has never taken a drink, Counselor.

161
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:42,204
Any further questions?

162
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:51,636
Psst.

163
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:53,991
Mr. Watt?

164
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,354
Mr. Watt, I'm still waiting

165
00:09:57,405 --> 00:09:59,803
to hear if you have any further questions...

166
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,939
Mr. Watt.

167
00:10:06,202 --> 00:10:07,912
He's stalling for some reason.

168
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:09,989
Mr. Watt.

169
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:14,628
My apologies, Your Honor.

170
00:10:15,632 --> 00:10:18,460
Um, and I have several more questions,if you please.

171
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:19,920
- Proceed.
- Thank you.

172
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:26,432
You knew Ms. Bannister very well, didn't you, Ms. Staley?

173
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:30,648
- As I said, we were roommates.
- Do you know my client?

174
00:10:31,095 --> 00:10:34,760
No. I have heard of him,read about him.

175
00:10:34,954 --> 00:10:36,859
I don't know him personally.

176
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,664
Well, do you like him?

177
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:42,899
I... don't know him.

178
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,366
But you don't hate him.

179
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:46,209
I mean, you have no reason

180
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,679
to lie here today,no reason to say anything

181
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,319
that might prejudice this jury against my client.

182
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,763
No, of course not.

183
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:55,682
I mean,
it's not like you were jealous of him.

184
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:57,826
Excuse me?

185
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:02,917
Well, I mean, given...how he felt about Ms. Bannister, and...

186
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:05,603
given how you felt about Ms. Bannister.

187
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:07,325
Excuse me?

188
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,471
Well, you were...in love with her...

189
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:11,643
weren't you, Ms. Staley?

190
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:22,952
Oh, my God.

191
00:11:23,261 --> 00:11:24,725
A simple "yes" or "no" will suffice.

192
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:25,525
Uh...

193
00:11:31,578 --> 00:11:32,449
Oh, my God.

194
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:37,955
Let the record show that Ms. Staley refused to answer.

195
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:40,652
No further questions.

196
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:48,674
Don't look so shocked.

197
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:51,341
You, of all people,should have seen that coming.

198
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:53,509
Who deposed that woman?

199
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,782
- I did. For seven hours.
- Seven hours?

200
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:57,857
And in all that time

201
00:11:57,908 --> 00:12:00,648
you didn't think that perhaps Ms. Staley's statements might be colored by...?

202
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:03,387
- No. No.
- Someone on Watt's team did.

203
00:12:03,716 --> 00:12:04,953
Happy Birthday.

204
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:14,231
I want everyone to pore over the witness list,

205
00:12:14,282 --> 00:12:17,635
review all the depositions, re-prepare all the witnesses if you have to.

206
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:20,344
I can't have another witness torpedoed like that.

207
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,329
- What?
- Lloyd's birthday.

208
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,618
They wanted to be sure you had a piece.

209
00:12:25,668 --> 00:12:26,429
I can come back.

210
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,698
No, no...Thank you, Sondra.

211
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:33,733
I'm not losing this case.

212
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:36,251
I may lose a few assistant district attorneys,

213
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:38,020
but I'm not losing this case.

214
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:40,679
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir.

215
00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:42,120
Thank you.

216
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:49,475
For what it's worth, most of the jurors are still with you.

217
00:12:49,526 --> 00:12:50,183
Well, that's good to know.

218
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:51,775
Unfortunately, I need all 12 of them

219
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:53,277
if I'm going to lock this kid up.

220
00:12:53,328 --> 00:12:56,603
Did you happen to notice this woman sitting behind Attorney Watt?

221
00:12:56,654 --> 00:12:58,716
She was wearing a scarf on her head.

222
00:12:58,997 --> 00:12:59,709
You hungry?

223
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:02,666
Right before Watt went in for the kill,

224
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:05,537
she leaned forward and whispered something to one of his assistants.

225
00:13:05,588 --> 00:13:08,883
Private detective? Friend of the defendant?

226
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:12,447
Damn it.

227
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,833
I don't... I don't know what to tell you, Allison.

228
00:13:14,884 --> 00:13:17,900
You think it's important? Should I have someone look into it?

229
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,275
The Mayor on line one.

230
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:20,583
Of course he is.

231
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,262
Court resumes tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

232
00:13:24,313 --> 00:13:26,083
- Can you be there?
- Of course.

233
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:26,923
Thank you.

234
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:30,456
Yes, Mr. Mayor.

235
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:38,949
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

236
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,484
- That's a lovely blouse.
- Thanks. It's new.

237
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:50,429
I'm confused.

238
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,413
- You didn't actually see a man with a gun?
- No.

239
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:55,888
And yet you felt compelled to scream,

240
00:14:55,939 --> 00:14:57,807
"There's a man with a gun in the elevator"?

241
00:14:57,858 --> 00:14:59,120
Apparently so.

242
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,637
Were you expecting a man with a gun?

243
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:02,530
No.

244
00:15:03,075 --> 00:15:04,615
I made a terrible mistake.

245
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:09,202
Are you currently on any kind of prescription medication, Mrs. Dubois?

246
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:15,315
Chief Parker... I recognize that this false alarm was a major inconvenience to you and your staff,

247
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:17,996
me and my staff,but it's clear to me

248
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:21,144
that what we're looking at here is a result of a simple mistake in judgment.

249
00:15:21,195 --> 00:15:23,261
Well, that's very understanding of you, Mr. District Attorney,

250
00:15:23,312 --> 00:15:25,677
but I still have to explain to my bosses on the City Council

251
00:15:25,728 --> 00:15:27,968
why a person would yell "gun" when there is no gun

252
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,929
or pull a fire alarm when there is no fire.

253
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,291
And I have every confidence you'll find a way to do that,

254
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:33,540
but if you run into any trouble,

255
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:36,349
be sure to have the people you answer to call me.

256
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:38,029
- But, Mr. District...
- Thank you, Chief.

257
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,586
Now do we have the all clear to go back in?

258
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,307
Yeah, we're all clear.

259
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,280
- I'm sorry, Chief.
- Thank you, Chief.

260
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:51,593
What is so funny?

261
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,357
Just imagining the headline in tomorrow's paper.

262
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,148
"D.A. Burned in Court,Not in Office."

263
00:15:58,199 --> 00:15:59,346
I'm so terribly sorry.

264
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:01,233
I don't even know where to begin.

265
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:04,612
It's okay. I take it this had something to do with a dream?

266
00:16:05,272 --> 00:16:06,769
Excuse me, Mr. District Attorney.

267
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,523
Excuse me.

268
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:11,867
Are you the one who pulled the alarm ?

269
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,036
This is for you.

270
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:18,662
$500?

271
00:16:22,267 --> 00:16:23,961
$500!

272
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:26,227
I'll pay for it. We'll take it out of my money.

273
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,245
Your money, my money,it's all...

274
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,158
Wait a second, I mean, can't we appeal this?

275
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:34,076
Well, we can, but we'd lose.

276
00:16:35,143 --> 00:16:36,761
It was a stupid dream when I dreamt it.

277
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:38,939
I didn't even mention it 'cause it seemed so silly,

278
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,653
but all the pieces seemed to come together.

279
00:16:42,763 --> 00:16:44,149
I was so certain.

280
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,919
Okay, fine. Well, I'll just add it to the list

281
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,185
of all the other bills we can't figure out how to pay.

282
00:16:49,236 --> 00:16:50,143
I'm sorry.

283
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,523
- Who is it?
- It's me.

284
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:56,038
Hey, it's my work buddy.

285
00:16:56,337 --> 00:16:57,913
What you got there, Pumpkin?

286
00:16:57,973 --> 00:17:01,426
- It's a picture.
- A picture of what?

287
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:04,537
- Daddy's work.
- Daddy's what?

288
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:08,409
His bomb. He and his friends are making it at work.

289
00:17:09,135 --> 00:17:11,717
Bridge, I told you Daddy is not making a bomb.

290
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,429
Daddy is making an algorithmic microprocessor component, remember?

291
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,228
Whatever you say.

292
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:21,868
- Who's going to tuck me in?
- Could we not?

293
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,687
I promised her I'd put it up.

294
00:17:25,437 --> 00:17:28,193
So where do you think she came up with something like this?

295
00:17:28,244 --> 00:17:29,702
She's a kid.
Who knows?

296
00:17:31,036 --> 00:17:32,983
So this component you're working on --

297
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:34,910
what exactly is it a component of?

298
00:17:34,961 --> 00:17:35,909
I have no idea.

299
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,745
It could be the component of a lot of things,

300
00:17:37,796 --> 00:17:41,728
but one thing I'm reasonably certain of it isn't a component of a bomb.

301
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:43,680
And how are you so sure?

302
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:46,293
Because, my dear, my company doesn't make bombs.

303
00:17:46,344 --> 00:17:47,877
We're an aeronautical firm, remember?

304
00:17:47,928 --> 00:17:49,830
As in airplanes and gliders and spaceships.

305
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:51,289
Not things that go boom.

306
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:53,759
What?

307
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,090
Nothing. It's just...

308
00:17:56,881 --> 00:18:00,503
I'm not the only person who gets feelings in this house, you know?

309
00:18:01,655 --> 00:18:05,994
If you don't know what it is you're building, you might think about asking somebody, that's all.

310
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:08,038
Okay, I'll add that to my to-do list.

311
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:13,133
Since I have to be up in six hours, you'll understand if it doesn't go right to the top.

312
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,614
You okay?

313
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,684
Fine. It's just this stupid dream

314
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:03,045
Ah, so that's who you are.

315
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:08,638
You're kidding me.

316
00:19:09,256 --> 00:19:11,144
Watt hired a psychic of his own?

317
00:19:11,224 --> 00:19:13,974
A pretty good one, too, according to her Web site.

318
00:19:15,315 --> 00:19:19,757
Supposedly, she's been working with the Albuquerque police on missing persons cases for years.

319
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:22,058
Although they won't corroborate that on the record.

320
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:25,389
Supposedly, even the FBI calls her for a consult every once in a while...

321
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,406
although they, too, won't corroborate.

322
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:31,779
She's worked missing persons, kidnapping cases, serial killers, you name it.

323
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,080
She's even written a book.

324
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:36,146
- According to her Web site.
- According to her Web site.

325
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:37,674
Dueling psychics.

326
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:41,643
This just might be a first for the American justice system.

327
00:19:41,694 --> 00:19:42,724
I don't get it.

328
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:44,451
You aren't concerned?

329
00:19:44,524 --> 00:19:46,502
Don't take this the wrong way, but for the most part,

330
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:50,828
recent false alarms notwithstanding, I believe in you.

331
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:54,029
I believe you believe everything you tell me.

332
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,366
And I'm astonished at how often you're right.

333
00:19:58,085 --> 00:20:01,202
But I also believe that people like you are extraordinarily rare.

334
00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:05,136
So, am I worried about some woman who advertises in the newspaper?

335
00:20:08,628 --> 00:20:09,955
I believe in the justice system.

336
00:20:10,006 --> 00:20:11,222
I believe in the power of truth,

337
00:20:11,273 --> 00:20:14,283
and I believe in the wisdom and the fairness of juries.

338
00:20:15,092 --> 00:20:19,477
Randy Pilgrim has been a teammate of Damon Hodges for the last two years.

339
00:20:20,282 --> 00:20:22,060
In about 20 minutes, he's going to testify

340
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:25,598
that Hodges has a habit of putting GHB into women's drinks.

341
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:28,382
Apparently, he's even boasted about it in the locker room.

342
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:30,167
If my belief systems hold water,

343
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:33,519
then Mr. Pilgrim's going to help me establish a pattern of behavior with this jury

344
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,060
that's going to put Damon Hodges behind bars.

345
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:39,740
Care to predict how it's going to go?

346
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,137
One last question, Mr. Pilgrim.

347
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:44,056
How do your teammates feel about you testifying today?

348
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:46,232
Some of them weren't very happy.

349
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,826
But I don't understand.

350
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,491
If Damon Hodges is truly guilty of what's being alleged here today

351
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,432
wouldn't they want to see him punished?

352
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:55,725
Wouldn't they want him put away where he could pose

353
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:59,004
no harm to their wives, their sisters,their girlfriends?

354
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,927
Yeah, but... He helps us win games.

355
00:21:05,638 --> 00:21:07,298
No more questions, Your Honor.

356
00:21:13,891 --> 00:21:16,281
So if I understand your testimony accurately,

357
00:21:16,997 --> 00:21:19,008
my client, Mr. Hodges,

358
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:23,576
has been boasting of drugging and taking advantage of women for months?

359
00:21:23,753 --> 00:21:25,338
Yes, sir,that's what I said, sir.

360
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:27,519
- How many months exactly?
- Excuse me?

361
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:31,189
What I'm asking you is how many months have you allegedly known

362
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,854
that my client drugs women for the purpose of having sex with them?

363
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:38,527
How many months was it that neither you nor anyone else on your team,

364
00:21:38,578 --> 00:21:41,785
for that matter,felt it necessary to call the authorities

365
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:44,734
or tell a coach or tell anyone?

366
00:21:45,698 --> 00:21:46,527
Not until now.

367
00:21:46,578 --> 00:21:50,934
Objection. We've already established that Mr. Pilgrim did not come forward immediately...

368
00:21:50,985 --> 00:21:53,320
that there was enormous peer pressure to remain silent.

369
00:21:53,371 --> 00:21:55,325
- Sustained.
- Move along, Mr. Watt.

370
00:21:58,544 --> 00:22:00,908
You know my client pretty well, don't you?

371
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:04,735
You played ball on the same team for a couple of seasons.

372
00:22:06,321 --> 00:22:08,594
Would you describe him as a handsome man?

373
00:22:11,446 --> 00:22:13,679
I don't know. I guess.

374
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,174
Does he strike you as the type of man

375
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:18,815
who would have to drug women to have sex with them?

376
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:22,082
Objection. Council is calling for an opinion from the witness

377
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:25,819
that is completely irrelevant and immaterial and inappropriate.

378
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,448
And for which the witness has no expertise.

379
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:32,357
Mr. Watt, if you don't have any substantive questionsfor this witness,

380
00:22:32,408 --> 00:22:34,394
I'm going to ask him to sit down.

381
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,061
So what will it be, Mr. Watt?

382
00:22:36,112 --> 00:22:39,450
Because right now you are trying this court's patience.

383
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,225
Have you any more substantive questions for this witness?

384
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,309
Begging the court's indulgence.

385
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,984
I'd like a minute to confer with my colleagues.

386
00:23:04,782 --> 00:23:09,780
If it please the court, the defense would like to present a few more questions to Mr. Pilgrim.

387
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:13,042
All right, Mr. Watt, but mind your manners.

388
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:16,039
Absolutely, Your Honor.

389
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:23,869
- Mr. Pilgrim... do you hate my client?
- God, no.

390
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:28,403
Come on...maybe just...just a little bit?

391
00:23:28,454 --> 00:23:29,905
Objection.
Leading the witness.

392
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:32,572
- Mr. Watt...
- I'll hurry it along,Your Honor.

393
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:37,295
Ever been to a Klan meeting, Mr. Pilgrim?

394
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,396
I'm sorry, was that a "yes" or a "no"?

395
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:47,638
You can't use that against me.

396
00:23:47,689 --> 00:23:49,454
Isn't it true that your Uncle Marshall,

397
00:23:49,505 --> 00:23:52,077
your father's brother, sits on the council...

398
00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:56,110
Objection.
Of what relevance are the associations of the witness's uncle...?

399
00:23:56,161 --> 00:23:56,995
Overruled.

400
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:00,200
- The witness will answer the question.
- Which one?

401
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:03,672
Have you ever been to a Klan meeting, Mr. Pilgrim?

402
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:07,219
Not because I wanted to go, no.

403
00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:10,773
Was that a "yes" or a "no"?

404
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:16,921
I've been to a Klan meeting, yes.

405
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:20,430
My... my uncle took me, I was a kid.

406
00:24:20,882 --> 00:24:21,687
I was, like, six.

407
00:24:21,738 --> 00:24:23,812
It was some kind of picnic or something.

408
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,523
But it wasn't like something I wanted to do.

409
00:24:25,574 --> 00:24:29,004
Let the record show that the witness answered in the affirmative.

410
00:24:29,108 --> 00:24:30,466
This witness is excused.

411
00:24:49,882 --> 00:24:52,419
I don't know what to tell you, boss. We're giving it our best shot.

412
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,792
Tomorrow at noon, I guess you'll tell us.

413
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:57,779
Right, that's easy for you to say.

414
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:01,359
You think I don't know that what I asked you to do is impossible?

415
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,065
No, I know you know.

416
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,550
You're the best engineer in this building.

417
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:07,227
Best engineer I've ever met.

418
00:25:08,188 --> 00:25:10,309
We just, we want to...we want to get this for you.

419
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,643
We want to, uh...well, we don't want to let you down.

420
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:18,254
- I appreciate all the hard work.
- Yeah, I appreciate the job.

421
00:25:18,998 --> 00:25:21,423
Oh, hey, you know what I've been meaning to ask you?

422
00:25:21,474 --> 00:25:25,571
Um, this algorithmic microprocessor, what exactly is it being integrated into?

423
00:25:26,206 --> 00:25:28,855
I mean, I understand it's a small part of a larger project,

424
00:25:28,906 --> 00:25:31,254
but what exactly is the initial application?

425
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:34,466
- It's a government project, Joe.
- No, I know.

426
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:37,158
I heard you say that yesterday. But I mean specifically.

427
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:38,031
Specifically?

428
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:41,232
Specifically for the first 18 months of its life

429
00:25:41,283 --> 00:25:44,351
my guess is that it will live on the nose of a missile

430
00:25:44,564 --> 00:25:47,031
for our own use or for sale to our allies

431
00:25:47,206 --> 00:25:50,775
and help guide it to its target so that innocent people won't get hurt.

432
00:25:50,826 --> 00:25:54,838
Shortly thereafter it will probably appear on home computers to facilitate

433
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:56,564
personal video conferencing.

434
00:25:57,087 --> 00:25:59,467
A few years after that, my hunch is some clever fellow

435
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:02,613
will use the technology in a child's game of some kind.

436
00:26:02,664 --> 00:26:04,307
Hopefully, it'll be a big hit at Christmas.

437
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:07,562
Pay us a lot of royalties. That would be my hunch.

438
00:26:09,738 --> 00:26:10,688
Night, Joe.

439
00:26:15,145 --> 00:26:18,088
And then Mr. Newberry told Hannah that she should spend less time

440
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:20,534
downloading music and more time studying...

441
00:26:20,602 --> 00:26:23,310
- Mom, I was still eating that.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

442
00:26:24,484 --> 00:26:25,901
Are you even listening to me?

443
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:28,892
- Honestly, I'm a little distracted.
- I noticed.

444
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:32,184
There's something I need to do tonight and I need Daddy to watch you girls.

445
00:26:32,235 --> 00:26:34,292
- What is it?
- Oh, it's this lecture.

446
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,628
This woman that I noticed in court, she wrote a book.

447
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,600
And she's going to speak tonight downtown.

448
00:26:38,651 --> 00:26:40,674
- Sounds boring.
- Thank you.

449
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:42,958
Hey...! Where's my picture?

450
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:45,553
The picture I drew of Daddy's bomb.

451
00:26:45,717 --> 00:26:49,236
I was going to bring it in to school for show-and-tell.

452
00:26:49,427 --> 00:26:51,301
Daddy doesn't have a bomb, doofus.

453
00:26:51,352 --> 00:26:52,771
- Hey.
- Not yet.

454
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:55,429
- Mom, tell her, please.
- You know...

455
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,851
- Look, Daddy's home.
- Daddy!

456
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:00,483
You're going to wake your sister.

457
00:27:00,534 --> 00:27:02,240
- Daddy!
- Sorry I'm late.

458
00:27:03,954 --> 00:27:04,554
Hi.

459
00:27:05,945 --> 00:27:07,887
I stopped and had a talk with my boss, and...

460
00:27:07,938 --> 00:27:10,167
Uh, Marie's asleep.I need a favor.

461
00:27:10,867 --> 00:27:13,145
- Will it hold?
- Uh, yeah, it'll hold.

462
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:14,282
Okay.

463
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,626
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Mom.

464
00:27:19,935 --> 00:27:24,153
"When little Autumn Mowry"was 13, she broke her neck diving into a pool.

465
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:30,335
"At her funeral, her mother and her younger sister cried so hard they had to be hospitalized.

466
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:33,214
"That... was in 1987.

467
00:27:33,994 --> 00:27:38,940
"When Autumn appeared to me in the year 2000,"she was practically screaming.

468
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,460
"Her younger sister had been missing for three days.

469
00:27:43,124 --> 00:27:48,120
"The police suspected that Autumn's sister had been abducted by a janitor at her school --

470
00:27:48,597 --> 00:27:53,879
a man they realized was a registered sex offender who had lied about his identity.

471
00:27:54,743 --> 00:27:57,401
But Autumn told me differently..."

472
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:59,658
What a load of crap.

473
00:28:00,023 --> 00:28:04,577
"Her spirit led me to an intersection on the outskirts of Albuquerque..."

474
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:07,976
You had a sudden bout of diarrhea, you lying whore.

475
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:09,628
If you hadn't been looking for a bathroom,

476
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,110
you'd have never been caught dead in that part of town.

477
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:15,025
Hey. Excuse me, could you keep it down over there?

478
00:28:15,143 --> 00:28:15,777
Shh! Shh!

479
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:20,162
"And that's when I saw them..."standing in the gas station convenience store.

480
00:28:20,213 --> 00:28:23,952
"He was holding her hand. She looked terrified.

481
00:28:24,007 --> 00:28:26,910
I was buying her something for dinner, you lying whore.

482
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:28,869
And she was smiling,by the way.

483
00:28:29,104 --> 00:28:31,857
Right up until the point where that police car came roaring up

484
00:28:31,908 --> 00:28:34,792
that you called and shot me three times in the head.

485
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:38,586
"How do I explain these extraordinary encounters with the dead?"

486
00:28:38,806 --> 00:28:40,258
It's called a coincidence.

487
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:43,109
and you've been dining off it for years, you fake.

488
00:28:43,575 --> 00:28:47,135
Can't wait 'til she gets down here to the hot zone where I live.

489
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:51,378
Man, are there a lot of pissed-off souls down here that want a piece of her.

490
00:28:51,823 --> 00:28:54,468
"It is truly a gift."

491
00:29:16,985 --> 00:29:19,010
Hey, where are you going with that?

492
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:22,629
- That's my work.
- This is not your work.

493
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:28,954
You've never spent one single moment of your life contemplating how to hurt someone else.

494
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:34,395
You knew the whole time. Didn't you, you witch?

495
00:29:37,939 --> 00:29:41,543
I remember being seven,I remember drawing pictures...

496
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:44,872
seeing them come true...not understanding.

497
00:29:45,944 --> 00:29:47,675
I'm not going to quit, Allison.

498
00:29:47,726 --> 00:29:50,859
I can't quit. I got you, I got the kids.

499
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:54,997
I got a mortgage and a stack of bills I can't pay already.

500
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,014
I can't quit.

501
00:29:57,593 --> 00:29:59,229
Maybe your company won't get the contract.

502
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,738
Maybe it'll all be moot.

503
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:03,484
No, we're going to get it.

504
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,393
I can feel it in my bones. We're going to get it.

505
00:30:08,091 --> 00:30:12,603
- How was the lecture?
- She was okay.

506
00:30:13,469 --> 00:30:15,402
Very interesting crowd.

507
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,602
Excuse me, can I help you?

508
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,401
What are you up to? What are you doing?

509
00:30:44,556 --> 00:30:46,954
You're killing everyone here, you know that?

510
00:30:48,153 --> 00:30:49,477
Why would you do that?

511
00:30:57,486 --> 00:30:59,306
Does it matter at all that the young man's guilty,

512
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,807
that he killed this girl?

513
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:05,409
It matters. But it's not the subject of this particular conversation.

514
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:12,128
Look... I get in your face a lot and so does the Mayor.

515
00:31:12,657 --> 00:31:15,935
But we both like you. And we both want you to stick around.

516
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,506
He wants you on the ticket. But you can't be there

517
00:31:19,557 --> 00:31:23,665
if this guy's going to make an ass out of you in that courtroom every day.

518
00:31:26,055 --> 00:31:30,068
I know. Same blouse.
Didn't get homelast night. Campaign season.

519
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:34,943
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Ten after 1:00.

520
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:36,796
You might have to walk with me.

521
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:41,171
I spent some time last night with Olga Z., Watts' psychic.

522
00:31:41,258 --> 00:31:43,966
- The woman is a fraud.
- I don't know, Allison.

523
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:45,797
Two days ago, I might have agreed with you.

524
00:31:45,848 --> 00:31:47,813
But she's kicking the stuffing out of me in that court.

525
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,329
No, I don't think so, not her.

526
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,464
Someone's giving Watt information we don't have, but I don't think it's her.

527
00:31:52,515 --> 00:31:53,445
Well, then who?

528
00:31:54,075 --> 00:31:55,626
I've been having this nutty dream lately

529
00:31:55,677 --> 00:31:58,220
which is the reason I pulled the fire alarm the other day.

530
00:31:58,271 --> 00:32:00,242
It's a massacre, here in the office.

531
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,702
This shooter comes in, wipes everybody out.

532
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:04,941
I was certain it was going to happen for real,

533
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:08,002
but last night I realized,it was a metaphor.

534
00:32:08,631 --> 00:32:10,787
I'm sorry, I'm not following any of this.

535
00:32:10,838 --> 00:32:13,466
This new assistant district attorney, Elliot?

536
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:15,163
He's holding the gun.

537
00:32:15,622 --> 00:32:18,867
Are you saying he's the one that's feeding Watt information?

538
00:32:18,918 --> 00:32:22,671
But he's only privy to what we're privy to -- the information in the depositions.

539
00:32:22,722 --> 00:32:25,399
In fact, he didn't even depose some of these witnesses.

540
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,205
I can't explain it yet. I don't know how it works,but...

541
00:32:28,256 --> 00:32:30,661
Okay. Here's the walk with me part.

542
00:32:32,735 --> 00:32:36,441
Allison, I have to be honest with you, what you're saying doesn't...

543
00:32:36,657 --> 00:32:38,087
make a whole lot of sense.

544
00:32:38,138 --> 00:32:40,125
And unless you can fill in the blanks and do it quickly,

545
00:32:40,176 --> 00:32:43,219
I have no choice but to head over to Watt's office and try to cut a deal.

546
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,670
- What?
- I'm on my way there now. I'm boxed in.

547
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:48,474
Unless I can assure the Mayor that Larry Watt's not gonna

548
00:32:48,525 --> 00:32:51,341
catch me with my pants down again in court, I really have no option.

549
00:32:51,392 --> 00:32:52,280
You all right?

550
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,475
What are you staring at, Allison?

551
00:32:55,526 --> 00:32:56,925
My metaphor, I hope.

552
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:05,226
- Larry Watt's waiting for me.
- No, don't go yet.

553
00:33:05,277 --> 00:33:08,074
- I have to go.
- This woman matters.

554
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:09,809
This woman is important.

555
00:33:13,085 --> 00:33:14,834
We have to go speak with her.

556
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,086
Come in.

557
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,098
- Elliot.
- Mr. District Attorney.

558
00:33:23,442 --> 00:33:25,194
I've asked you to come in, Elliot, because even though

559
00:33:25,245 --> 00:33:26,512
you've worked here only a short time,

560
00:33:26,563 --> 00:33:28,995
I've come to feel a certain connection with you,

561
00:33:29,046 --> 00:33:30,840
and I wanted to share something.

562
00:33:31,027 --> 00:33:34,893
Something that very few people other than Mrs. Dubois here know about me.

563
00:33:36,077 --> 00:33:39,390
Well, thank you, uh, I guess.

564
00:33:40,758 --> 00:33:42,082
I'm a psychic, Elliot.

565
00:33:44,598 --> 00:33:46,308
- Excuse me?
- I'm a psychic.

566
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,920
I can pluck things from people's minds.

567
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,506
For instance, even though you've never introduced us,

568
00:33:54,557 --> 00:33:58,489
I know that your fiancee works in Student Services over at Mesa University

569
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:03,604
as a psychiatrist,I believe.

570
00:34:04,098 --> 00:34:06,537
- How am I doing?
- May I sit down?

571
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:07,188
No.

572
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,396
And I bet if I subpoenaed her records,

573
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:13,609
I'd find that she met with young Amanda Staley,

574
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:19,291
helped her cope with her heartache after she realized that she fell in love with her roommate.

575
00:34:19,342 --> 00:34:23,978
- If could just sit...
- I need you to stay right where you are.

576
00:34:26,947 --> 00:34:30,998
I'm also sensing that she met with Randy Pilgrim.

577
00:34:31,177 --> 00:34:35,960
Helped him deal with the guilt of growing up in a family filled with racists and worse.

578
00:34:36,011 --> 00:34:37,012
Am I warm?

579
00:34:38,726 --> 00:34:42,025
- I'm feeling a little faint,actually...
- Stay where you are.

580
00:34:42,076 --> 00:34:46,648
So Attorney Watt would come into the courtroom armed with all this information ahead of time.

581
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:51,363
He'd put on a little act, pretend that the District Attorney was beating the pants off him,

582
00:34:51,414 --> 00:34:53,259
and then just in the nick of time,

583
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:56,572
he'd get some new and explosive information from his psychic,

584
00:34:57,535 --> 00:35:00,253
all to convince us that he was unbeatable.

585
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:03,842
All to convince us that we'd better make a deal.

586
00:35:04,084 --> 00:35:06,130
How much you make a year working for the city, Elliot?

587
00:35:06,181 --> 00:35:07,747
And what was Watt promising?

588
00:35:07,798 --> 00:35:09,565
About three times that?

589
00:35:11,169 --> 00:35:14,573
There are two options here, Elliot,and I want you to pick one.

590
00:35:14,686 --> 00:35:17,594
I fire you right here and now, report you to the Arizona Bar.

591
00:35:17,645 --> 00:35:22,799
They strip you of your license and you never work as a lawyer again ever, anywhere.

592
00:35:23,801 --> 00:35:25,043
Or option two:

593
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,329
you help me even the score a bit,

594
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,329
I still fire you, write a horrible letter of recommendation for your file,

595
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,231
but with hard work in four or five years,

596
00:35:32,282 --> 00:35:36,164
you might get with a decent firm and be able to actually earn a living.

597
00:35:36,864 --> 00:35:41,160
Don't tell me. Don't tell me 'cause I'm guessing

598
00:35:41,211 --> 00:35:45,143
that you pick option number two.

599
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:49,899
Mr. James, in your deposition, you described yourself as the team manager.

600
00:35:50,629 --> 00:35:53,458
And isn't it true that part of your responsibility

601
00:35:53,509 --> 00:35:55,936
was to pick up Damon Hodges at 6:30 every morning,

602
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,999
make sure he was there for practice?

603
00:35:58,234 --> 00:35:58,862
Yes, sir.

604
00:35:59,037 --> 00:36:01,535
And isn't it fair to say that you enjoyed that part of your job,

605
00:36:01,586 --> 00:36:03,805
that you admired Mr. Hodges,

606
00:36:03,856 --> 00:36:07,480
found him glamorous, enjoyed being in his company?

607
00:36:07,652 --> 00:36:08,749
Yes, sir, I did.

608
00:36:08,962 --> 00:36:12,661
Now, in your deposition, you stated that you picked up Damon Hodges

609
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,353
for practice on the morning in question at 6:30.

610
00:36:15,404 --> 00:36:18,338
And he confessed that he had a young woman over the night before

611
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:21,074
who apparently had left in the middle of the night.

612
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:23,569
You then go on to describe how Damon said

613
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,360
he just needed to brush his teeth and headed into the bathroom,

614
00:36:26,411 --> 00:36:32,422
that you then heard Damon hollering, screaming for you to call 911.

615
00:36:33,104 --> 00:36:35,671
Isn't it true that when you were deposed by my office,

616
00:36:35,722 --> 00:36:38,499
we showed you these phone records indicating you received

617
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,984
a phone call at 4:30 in the morning?

618
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:43,450
A phone call that was made from a pay phone

619
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,971
not three blocks from Damon Hodges' townhouse?

620
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:49,086
A phone call that you repeatedly insisted

621
00:36:49,137 --> 00:36:52,583
was simply a wrong number and that woke you from a sound sleep?

622
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,675
That's what I said.

623
00:36:57,379 --> 00:36:58,570
Is that the truth?

624
00:37:04,492 --> 00:37:05,924
No, it is not.

625
00:37:06,264 --> 00:37:07,610
- Objection.
- Overruled.

626
00:37:07,661 --> 00:37:09,757
You'll have your opportunity to cross.

627
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:10,644
Proceed.

628
00:37:12,184 --> 00:37:16,552
The truth is it was Damon Hodges who called you at 4:30 that morning, isn't it?

629
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,557
Yes, sir.

630
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:22,371
And you went to his apartment at 4:45, not at 6:30.

631
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,170
- Yes.
- Objection, Your Honor.

632
00:37:24,221 --> 00:37:27,123
- Counsel's leading the witness.
- Overruled, Mr. Watt.

633
00:37:27,722 --> 00:37:30,288
Now what really happened when you arrived there?

634
00:37:34,017 --> 00:37:35,207
I saw Amy Bannister.

635
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,328
Damon told me that he brought her home to party, but she wasn't into it.

636
00:37:40,379 --> 00:37:43,821
She wanted to leave. They had a fight,and he pushed her down,

637
00:37:43,873 --> 00:37:45,935
she hit her head on the shower door.

638
00:37:46,205 --> 00:37:47,853
He said it happened really fast.

639
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:51,251
He was scared and he wanted me to help him cover it up.

640
00:37:53,618 --> 00:37:57,500
We poured vodka down her throat and then waited until 6:30 to call 911.

641
00:37:59,247 --> 00:38:01,099
And what did you do until 6:30?

642
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:07,146
We played cards.Damon wanted to play cards.

643
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,382
No further questions.

644
00:38:14,578 --> 00:38:15,894
Mr. Watt, your witness.

645
00:38:22,311 --> 00:38:24,231
It's pretty interesting, Mr. James.

646
00:38:25,008 --> 00:38:26,811
You tell one story for months and months,

647
00:38:26,862 --> 00:38:29,830
you tell it to the police, you tell it in depositions,

648
00:38:30,515 --> 00:38:33,273
and then you get here in court and you change it.

649
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:36,287
Why would you do a thing like that?

650
00:38:36,927 --> 00:38:39,144
I felt bad. I couldn't sleep.

651
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:43,955
You couldn't sleep because you felt badly about lying before,

652
00:38:44,006 --> 00:38:48,021
or you couldn't sleep because you felt badly about having to lie today?

653
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:49,776
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

654
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,523
Mr. Watt,if you're going to attack this witness's testimony,

655
00:38:52,574 --> 00:38:54,572
I need you to do it based on matters of record,

656
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,498
not by restating the obvious.

657
00:38:56,549 --> 00:38:57,907
I apologize, Your Honor.

658
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,515
Mr. Watt,are you going to proceed or shall we dismiss the witness?

659
00:39:07,281 --> 00:39:11,005
Mr. Watt,I need to know if you've concluded your cross.

660
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:20,286
Mr. Watt?

661
00:39:22,723 --> 00:39:26,037
Your Honor, actually, I have several more questions for this witness.

662
00:39:26,088 --> 00:39:29,171
- We are all ears, Mr. Watt.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

663
00:39:33,547 --> 00:39:37,296
So you couldn't sleep and that's why you changed your story today?

664
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:39,049
Yes, sir. I couldn't sleep.

665
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:42,170
I couldn't study. I couldn't do much of anything.

666
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:46,363
And you're sure this doesn't have anything to do with you father, Mr. James?

667
00:39:47,403 --> 00:39:48,425
How do you mean?

668
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:52,246
Well, isn't it true that your father is staring at multiple felony charges

669
00:39:52,297 --> 00:39:53,621
filed by this district attorney?

670
00:39:53,672 --> 00:39:54,803
Objection: irrelevant.

671
00:39:54,854 --> 00:39:57,000
- Whoever this young man's father is...
- Overruled.

672
00:39:57,051 --> 00:40:01,209
For theft, for forgery, for credit card fraud,

673
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,452
for the sale of narcotics to a minor?

674
00:40:03,503 --> 00:40:04,220
Objection.

675
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:05,626
Overruled, Counsel.

676
00:40:05,677 --> 00:40:07,303
Get to the question, Counsel.

677
00:40:07,388 --> 00:40:10,711
And isn't it true that the sudden change in your story today

678
00:40:10,762 --> 00:40:15,674
has more to do with the District Attorney promising to go easy on good ol' dad?

679
00:40:15,725 --> 00:40:18,310
- I must object!
- Overruled.

680
00:40:19,064 --> 00:40:22,067
Remember, Mr. James, you are under oath.

681
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:26,386
You are in a court of law and I am asking you a direct question.

682
00:40:27,243 --> 00:40:30,551
Isn't it true that the reason for changing your story today

683
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:34,893
has nothing to do with my client nothing to do with the truth,

684
00:40:34,944 --> 00:40:39,916
nothing to do with justice, but has everything to do

685
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:42,567
with your degenerate father and some understanding

686
00:40:42,714 --> 00:40:45,246
between you and the District Attorney here?

687
00:40:46,308 --> 00:40:47,878
- That is not true, sir.
- Oh, really?

688
00:40:47,929 --> 00:40:53,311
Are you denying that as we speak, your father sits in a cell in Prescott,

689
00:40:53,362 --> 00:40:55,309
awaiting extradition to Phoenix?

690
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,609
Sir, my father's an appellate court judge in the Sixth District of the state of Missouri.

691
00:41:01,353 --> 00:41:06,645
Although, currently he's on temporary leave to work on a U.N. commission investigating aid to Africa.

692
00:41:07,197 --> 00:41:10,131
In fact, the two of you went to the same law school.

693
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:14,134
He was a year behind you -- Bennett James?

694
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:17,253
He said to say hello.

695
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:20,726
Oh.

696
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:29,283
Mr. Watt, is there any follow-up?

697
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:32,234
Was there any basis to this line of questioning?

698
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:35,101
You just attacked this witness ruthlessly,and I --

699
00:41:35,152 --> 00:41:37,858
and I'm sure I'm speakingfor these 12 jurors as well,

700
00:41:37,909 --> 00:41:39,499
would like to know why.

701
00:41:41,177 --> 00:41:43,399
Begging Your,Your Honor's pardon.

702
00:41:43,681 --> 00:41:48,023
Before proceeding, defense would like to take a moment to confer with the prosecution.

703
00:41:48,074 --> 00:41:49,474
This is highly irregular.

704
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:51,032
Keep it brief.

705
00:41:58,746 --> 00:42:02,866
Hey, Manny, I got to believe there's some kind of a deal to be made here.

706
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:05,105
You know, one that's good for everyone.

707
00:42:05,596 --> 00:42:06,618
What do you say?

708
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:11,989
Me? I say manslaughter, minimum of 15 years.

709
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:16,796
Don't look so shocked. You, of all people, had to see this coming.

710
00:42:23,216 --> 00:42:27,904
