1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,960
previously on "Medium"...

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,110
there were 5 of us in that room.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,310
only two of us made it out alive.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,430
my name is Cooper Conroy, I'm an attorney, mr. dubois.

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,680
- can you talk for a moment?
- talk about what?

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,140
about millions of dollars I believe you're entitled to.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,860
- what is it?
- it's a liability waiver.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,560
you're saying if I don't sign this, I can't come back to work.

9
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,940
Walter Paxton chopped his wife's head off

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,850
and kept her head as souvenir.

11
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,670
we find that the defendent guilty of murder in the first degree.

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,290
I thought you needed to see this.

13
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,320
It's Natalie Paxton's head.

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,950
on Ramona Hensley's body.


15
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,520
City Hall is already being inundated with people calling 
for the immediate release of Walter Paxton.

16
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,790
The woman who hit my car, she wants to have lunch.

17
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,460
what is it like, working for the DA?

18
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,090
I need to talk to you about a dream I just had.

19
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,270
you said there are 5 victims, and you say your friend is victim No. 4.

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,420
I thought about you, in a hotel, by yourself.

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,590
Don't be concerned, there's thousands of hotel rooms
in Phoenix and only one recapitator

22
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,130
Your boss gets fired after the death of the fifth victim.

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,350
I like being the new D.A. of Phoenix.

24
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,600
Don't let your friend get murdered, stop the murder, stop the murderer.

25
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,840
Cheryl Ann Potts,24 years old.

26
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,690
The maid found her in the hotel bath tub,

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,980
previous victim's head was there as well.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,330
it was her head that ends up on Debra's body,

29
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,860
we can't allow that happen.

30
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,110
this national reporter, P.D. McCall, has been
writing some pretty nasty pieces about me.

31
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,930
talk about some of the work you do for us.

32
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,580
Where would something like thatcome from?

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,470
Is it apparently came from you,allison.

34
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,200
I don't even know a P.D.Mccall.

35
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,720
- I think maybe you do.
- P.D.

36
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,870
You're not at all who you say you are, are you?

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,640
Okay, but then if you were really the psychic you claim to be,
wouldn't you have known that?

38
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,370
You cannot run this story.

39
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,100
I told you things in confidence.

40
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,310
Crazy things, Allison.

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,830
I told you those things to save your life!

42
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,670
Hey.

43
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,710
Baby, honey.

44
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,940
Try not to wake your sister.

45
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,270
Daddy and I have to talk to you.

46
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,390
You know how we never really told anyone about mommy's dreams?

47
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,750
About how mommy sees things, knows things sometimes?

48
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,430
Well, now that this article's in the paper, people are going to know.

49
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,220
Some people,some people...

50
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,900
are going to thinkthat mommy's lying.

51
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,820
And some people might even think that mommy's crazy.

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,750
And you two may hear some of that at school and when you're out.

53
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,080
You really think people are going to think that?

54
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,900
Some.

55
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,950
So what do we do?

56
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,270
I mean, if someone says something bad?

57
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,260
Well, what I'd like you to try to do is to ignore it.

58
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,720
I mean, we know the truth, right?

59
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,140
Excuse me, are you Allison Dubois?

60
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,450
You just pulled into her parking space.

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,560
- If you'll just...
- is this her?

62
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,140
- I think so.
- I have to get to work.

63
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,640
Can you talk about your relationship as a spiritual advisor to the district attorney?

64
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,670
Do you actually talk to dead people?

65
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,260
Are there any dead people here now?

66
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,510
- Could you point them out to us?
- I really have to get to work.

Season 3 Episode 22</font>

70
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,220
The fourth victim's name was Pamela Franklin.

71
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,880
27 years old.

72
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,400
Does she even look like your reporter friend?

73
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,510
She's not my friend.

74
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,030
Sorry.
Just curious.

75
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,790
- No, not even close.
- Speaking of which,

76
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,830
we have removed all surveillance and protective manpower from ms. Livingston--

77
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,300
that is to say ms. Mccall-- and her hotel.

78
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,670
I mentioned it to the deputy mayor.

79
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,700
She's going to make sure the press is informed.

80
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,540
Gee, if I had known,

81
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,500
I could have mentioned it to the welcoming committee of reporters

82
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,730
who greeted me in the parking garage this morning.

83
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,100
I'm sorry, you were briefing us on victim number four.

84
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,900
got an old friend of yours out here.

85
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,970
Mind if i bring him in?

86
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,790
Tom.

87
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,220
Fantastic.

88
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,770
I am so glad that you could make this work.

89
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,910
For you, manny, anything.

90
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,900
I'm not going down like my predecessor.

91
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,680
I like being the new D.A. of Phoenix.

92
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,640
came straight from the airport.

93
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,380
I'd like you all to meet an old law school buddy of mine, Tom Van Dyke--

94
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,250
assistant district attorney out of Flagstaff and a good friend.

95
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,230
The governor suggested that I bring in a new face to help, um...

96
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,890
how'd he put it?

97
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,620
Dissipate some of the heat we're feeling,

98
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,300
and tom was the first man I thought of.

99
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,790
You've already met lynn.

100
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,300
This is detective lee scanlon.

101
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,580
- Detective.
- Pleasure.

102
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,840
And over here is Allison Dubois from my office.

103
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,370
I think I read about you on the plane.

104
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,730
Well, don't believe everything you read.

105
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,980
actually, your timing is perfect.

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,280
Lee was just briefing us on the tragic killing last night--

107
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,200
a young woman named Pamela Franklin.

108
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,430
27, physical therapist.

109
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,820
Where was she from?

110
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,370
That's one of the things that's throwing us for a bit of a loop.

111
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,250
She isn't from anywhere-- she's local.

112
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,720
Lived here all her life.

113
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,930
Local?
I don't get it.

114
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,140
Then why was she staying in a hotel?

115
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,960
We're still trying to figure that out.

116
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,100
Coroner got a time of death?

117
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,490
Almost down to the minute.

118
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,750
Now, nobody knows this,

119
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,500
but unlike our previous three victims

120
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,540
victim number four was not completely beheaded.

121
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,850
What does that mean, not completely?

122
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,230
He started the job,

123
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,300
but a fire alarm went off at exactly 7:17 last night.

124
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,450
It apparently spooked him,

125
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,110
sent him fleeing before he could finish.

126
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,210
He didn't happen to leave behind...?

127
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,320
Victim number three's head?

128
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,380
Unfortunately not.

129
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,570
hi.
Joe dubois.

130
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,950
Mr. Dubois, this is Cooper Conroy.
We met several days ago.

131
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,320
Yes, Mr. Conroy, I know i haven't gotten back to you.

132
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,290
Things have actually gotten a little more complicated with my employer.

133
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,190
They want me to sign some papers before they'll let me go back to work, and...

134
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,510
I need to meet you tomorrow.

135
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,060
Maybe at the same coffee shop, 10:00?

136
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,150
Sure.
Is everything all right?

137
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,340
I'll see you at 10:00, Mr. Dubois.

138
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,680
I'm heading out.

139
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,580
You're the last one here.

140
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,680
You okay?

141
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,130
I'm, uh...

142
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,280
I'm great, actually.

143
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,850
Really? What are you taking and where can I get some?

144
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,880
Allison, I do believe I have survived the worst day of my career,

145
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,000
and I can't explain it, really,

146
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,320
except to say that people get it.

147
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,000
The mayor gets it,the governor gets it.

148
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,400
Everyone understands we make mistakes,

149
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:38,470
and I find that gratifying, exhilarating.

150
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,700
Have you checked in at home?

151
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,670
No, it's weird.

152
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,060
There are no reporters camped out on the front lawn.

153
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,850
The kids were fine at school.

154
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,250
I guess at the end of the day,

155
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,030
Pamela Franklin's murder was a bigger story

156
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,010
than you or your oddball sidekick.

157
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,590
oh, excuse me, I didn't know anyone was here.

158
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,590
How did you not hear the hair dryer?

159
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,690
I'm sorry, I...

160
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,570
can you just please get out?

161
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,430
You want me to come back later?

162
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,370
No, I don't want you to come back ever.

163
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,590
Do you see this?

164
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,020
This means do not disturb, okay?

165
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,840
I don't care about the stupid sheets or the towels.

166
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,210
I don't want anyone in my room.

167
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,980
Not with everything that's going on around here.

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,340
And when I checked in, I told you people that.

169
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,240
I understand.

170
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,470
Excuse me. Con permiso, disculpe...
Oh my god!

171
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,740
It's a very generous,generous offer.

172
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,240
May I?

173
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,900
- Yes.
- Thank you.

174
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,580
This has been cleared?

175
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,440
And that is money you will actually see,

176
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:56,010
not money you have to fight for in a court of law for six or seven...years.

177
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:02,060
sorry, I, uh, didn't realize anyone was in here.

178
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,730
- Mr. District attorney.
- Manuel.

179
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,800
Will you two just, uh,give me a moment?

180
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,390
Sure.

181
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,910
I'm sorry to surprise you.

182
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,980
That meeting came together very quickly.

183
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,720
I apologize if anything looks untoward, Manny, but

184
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,300
the mayor, the governor, everyone

185
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,270
just felt that the most efficient path to a quick settlement out of court

186
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,530
would be to put a new face...

187
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,380
a quick settlement?
What are you talking about?

188
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:43,670
They're threatening to file a wrongful prosecution suit against the city-- $50 million.

189
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,120
And I've been told to take the lead on this.

190
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,470
"Get out in front of it,"so that's what I'm doing.

191
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,370
Again, I apologize that you were out of the loop.I...

192
00:10:53,400 --> 00:11:00,010
no, I certainly see the wisdom in having a new face broker that sort of conversation.

193
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,920
I appreciate you understanding, Manny.

194
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,920
Well, I'd better get back inside.
We're sort of at a delicate spot.

195
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,490
Of course.

196
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,660
good morning.

197
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,250
We'll see about that.

198
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,090
You have to listen to what I'm about to tell you.

199
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,390
I have no interest in anything you have to say.

200
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,760
You think the storm is over,

201
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,800
you think the worst is past,but you're wrong.

202
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,480
It's only just begun.

203
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,910
Even as we speak,I have to believe that

204
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,170
the people above him are doing everything they can

205
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,240
to isolate your boss and completely distance themselves from you.

206
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,020
Fine.

207
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,460
There's going to come a time when you're going to want to get your side of the story out.

208
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,700
And there's gonna be all kinds of people vying for that story.

209
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,160
I hope you'll think of me.

210
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,820
- You're insane!
- Whatever you say.

211
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,400
After all you've done to me, after all you've done to my family,

212
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,910
why would I ever speak to you again?

213
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,280
Come on, Allison,I'm the devil you know.

214
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,240
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Not to worry.

215
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,170
My employer, my boss gave me this to sign.

216
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,160
It came with a very generous check.

217
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,700
But the implication was pretty clear:

218
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,910
"If you don't sign this,you can't come back to work."

219
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,380
Well, then by all means,you should sign it.

220
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,530
I don't think you understand.
It's a liability waiver of some kind.

221
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,430
Um, I think that if I sign this,

222
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,700
it's going to make it very difficult for you for you to take them to court.

223
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,970
You might want to take a look at it.

224
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,040
I don't need to look at it.

225
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,190
This woman who's helped the D.A. get in all this trouble,

226
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,610
she's your wife,isn't she?

227
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,400
Why? What does that have to do with anything?

228
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:21,200
Well, according to these articles, she claims to talk to dead people.

229
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,870
Do you believe that?

230
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,470
You believe she talks to dead people?

231
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,110
Actually, I do.

232
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,570
But what does this have to...?

233
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,950
And you'd swear to that under oath?

234
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,430
Mr. Dubois, for me to prevail in this case,

235
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,120
I have to convince a jury to believe you, to believe in you.

236
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:52,260
If before I can do that, I have to convince them that dead people talk to your wife...

237
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,580
I would sign that paper.

238
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,870
Cash that check.

239
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,960
It was very nice meeting you, sir.

240
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,390
First pitch to him...

241
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,710
testing test, one, two.

242
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,080
Testing test, one, two.

243
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,230
Get the hitter to chase that rising fastball,

244
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,750
but the two-one pitch.

245
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:25,160
Swing at the ball, hit in the aiinto foul territory in shallow right.

246
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,280
The 1-oh pitch on the way.

247
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,060
- Mr. Paxton, thank you for coming.
- Oh, how could I not?

248
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,540
You've been my greatest supporter,my greatest defender.

249
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,850
Just trying to get to the truth,

250
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,500
which is what I wanted to talk to you about.

251
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,890
I believe there's a book in all of this,

252
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,250
in everything that's happened to you; an important one--my publisher does, too.

253
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,250
I was hoping I might persuade you to collaborate.

254
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,820
The two-one pitch.

255
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,360
There's a swing and a soft liner...

256
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,090
arizona's down by three.

257
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,580
Tough luck for arizona.

258
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,400
And anyone who has a bet on them.

259
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,490
The short stop will make a nice throw over to first.

260
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,680
I know they've frozen your bank accounts while they hash out the details of your wife's estate.

261
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,040
My publisher is willing to extend their generous advance immediately.

262
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,450
I don't need money, Ms. Mccall.

263
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,710
Oh, well, you'll need to live on something while you mount a suit against the city.

264
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,180
You know about that?

265
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,450
I know a lot of things.

266
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,740
Litigation can take a long time,

267
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:32,630
and my sense is that district attorney devalos is not inclined to settle quickly.

268
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,280
Well, I have reason to believe that

269
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:38,380
that decision will soon be out of the district attorney's hands.

270
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,650
I appreciate your offer, miss Mccall.

271
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,010
I'll look forward to reading your next article.

272
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:49,060
Struck him out and now he is just one out...

273
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,230
I don't appreciate your attitude, ariel!

274
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,090
I've had a horrible day, too.

275
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,580
Bridgette, can you get Marie a snack?

276
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,120
Mommy wants to get out of her work clothes.

277
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,400
That must be nice.

278
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,830
It isn't.

279
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,660
Hello.

280
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,010
Good-bye.

281
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,060
Who was that?

282
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,010
Some reporter from some paper.

283
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,970
They've been callingall afternoon,

284
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,710
which I really don't appreciate because I'm waiting for a call from my boss.

285
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,940
Your boss?
Why?

286
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,210
Have you decided whether or not to sue?

287
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,790
Oh, yeah.

288
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,040
Yeah, the lawyer made it real easy for me.

289
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,520
Really?
What'd he say?

290
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,170
He said he was dropping me as a client.

291
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,440
He seemed to think that in light of recent events, that, uh,

292
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:42,260
I might have a bit of a credibility problem with the juries.

293
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,920
'Cause of me.

294
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,100
Hello.

295
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,780
Good-bye.

296
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:48,640
Did something else happen?

297
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,510
That phone all of a sudden is ringing off the hook.

298
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,560
Yeah, something's happened.

299
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,720
The whole world's fallen off its axis.

300
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,160
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

301
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,020
I went to work-- no devalos;he's just not there.

302
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,290
I can't get a straight answer from anybody.

303
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,830
I call his house, no answer.

304
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,990
Turns out that his friend they brought in to help is suddenly running the place.

305
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,350
He sends an assistant over to me

306
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,510
to tell me that my part-time consulting services

307
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,710
probably won't be needed for the foreseeable future.

308
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,000
Ariel hates me because some kid at school found out that

309
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,500
she got the highest grade on the algebra test,

310
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,920
and they're convinced that I got the answers from that morrissey kid

311
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,960
who died in that swimming mishap last summer.

312
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,900
Come on.

313
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,320
I had a dreamlast night,

314
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,660
the fourth victim has a spare head in her hotel fridge,

315
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,700
which would either imply that she is the killer and killed herself or...

316
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,340
or?

317
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,150
Or debra is right,and I'm crazy,

318
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,810
and this whole dreaming thing isn't all it's cracked up to be.

319
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,090
So we're not suing?

320
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,050
No?

321
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,660
So there's no millions,no tens of millions.

322
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,980
Uh, no, I'm going back to my old job.

323
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,390
Thousands, tens of thousands.

324
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,850
Because of me.

325
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,070
No, 'cause that's the way it should be.

326
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,020
I never really felt right

327
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,450
in profiting from all that death.

328
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,670
The truth is I miss my work.

329
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,620
so I'm okay.

330
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,980
If my boss would only call me back.

331
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:23,100
And what about Devalos and your crazy dream and your angry daughter?

332
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,260
What are we going to do about that?

333
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,240
I just want to go to sleep and not wake up for 20 years.

334
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,620
I like that.

335
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,060
Deal with your problems head on.

336
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,780
I'll go look in on ariel.

337
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,010
You get some rest.

338
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,090
Housekeeping.

339
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,700
Housekeeping!

340
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,830
Can you step back please,so I can see you?

341
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,860
Sorry about that.

342
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,640
I guess I'm a little paranoidwith everything on the news.

343
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,660
You know what?
Forget about the bathroom.

344
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm just now running a bath.

345
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,730
Would you mind just leaving me towels and making up the bed?

346
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,330
Thanks.

347
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,370
Excuse me.I thought I told you to just do the bed...

348
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,250
no!

349
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,460
Lynn Dinovi.

350
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,260
Lynn, hi.
This is Allison Dubois.

351
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,100
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

352
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,520
That's okay, allison.

353
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,280
I'm just getting home from a task force meeting.

354
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,770
- What can I do for you?
- I'm looking for lee.

355
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,930
I can't seem to get ahold of him you haven't seen him, have you?

356
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,260
No.I mean, he was at this meeting,

357
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,670
but where he went after that?

358
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,620
- You know Lee.
- Do me a favor.

359
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,500
If you see him, will you let him know that I need to speak with him?

360
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,010
Will do.

361
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,420
Perfect.

362
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,900
Allison.
I thought we were friends.

363
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,920
I thought I could count on you--you and Devalos.

364
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,310
I have things to tell you!

365
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,500
I am still dreaming about this case!

366
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,000
Look, I understand that Manny is in hot water.

367
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,060
I know you're on thin ice where you are, but...

368
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,720
we are friends,

369
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,490
but it's really not smart for me to be seen talking to you.

370
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,580
Not here.
Not now.

371
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,140
- And as for manny...
- yeah, okay,let's talk about him.

372
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,550
I get it.
Someone told him to stay home.

373
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,390
But neither of you takes my calls?

374
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,550
Allison, Manny is on a boat in the gulf of mexico fishing.

375
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,170
He isn't taking anybody's calls!

376
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,290
And when he comes back-- if he comes back--

377
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,840
it'll be because the city of phoenix gets Walter Paxton to sign a settlement agreement.

378
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,750
And, hopefully, for a lot less than $50 million!

379
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,310
And as for you,what do you want me to say?

380
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,860
You're toxic!
You just are!So I'm sorry.

381
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,960
Given the way things are going, nobody wants to hear your dreams!

382
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,220
Nobody wants to hear from Allison Dubois.

383
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,790
All right, I'm sorry.
Tell me.I want to hear it.

384
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,380
Tell me your dream.

385
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,360
Pamela franklin.
Victim four.

386
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,110
I saw her put on a maid's uniform,

387
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,610
talk her way into Cheryl Ann Potts' room.

388
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,130
She brought knives.

389
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,060
She brought victim number two's head.

390
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,750
It doesn't make any sense.

391
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,880
I know it doesn't make complete sense, but it answers a lot of questions.

392
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,210
- Like?
- Like how does he get into the room?

393
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,020
- He impersonates a housekeeper.
- The victims let him in.

394
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,240
And why is it we can't figure out who he is?

395
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,670
'Cause he isn't a he at all.

396
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,940
That's very nice.
It's...it's...

397
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,650
it's very interesting.

398
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,200
But aren't you leaving something out?

399
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,900
I don't know who killed pamela franklin.

400
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,440
Maybe it's someone outside this whole situation.

401
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,270
Maybe that's why he didn't finish chopping her head off.

402
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,490
Maybe that's why he didn't leave behind victim number three's head.

403
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,450
Or you're just wrong.

404
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,010
Like you've been on just about every aspect of this one.

405
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,240
Go home, Allison.

406
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,340
Let us figure this one out the old-fashioned way.

407
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,100
The way we used to do it.

408
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,710
You still interested in talking to me?
'Cause no one else is.

409
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,050
I need you to do something for me.
I need you to change hotels.

410
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,020
And I need you to do it now.

411
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,730
So what's going to happen to me this time?

412
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,660
What?

413
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,480
You know, I just realized that it seems like you're always expecting a call.

414
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,280
Oh.
Yeah.

415
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,340
Trade secret.
It's also a digital recorder.

416
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,720
I like to make sure I have it out

417
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,670
when I'm about to have a conversation that might be quote-worthy.

418
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,570
So why am I changing hotels?

419
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,660
I had another dream last night.

420
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,100
- Of course you did.
- I saw the third murder.

421
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,000
Really?
You saw it?

422
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,010
- So who did it?
- Doesn't matter.

423
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,110
I beg to differ, Allison.
It's all that matters.

424
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,680
No.You don't understand.
I saw the third murder.

425
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,110
I thought it was important.
I went to the police.

426
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,690
I tried telling them about my dream.

427
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,950
But of course,they won't listen to me anymore.

428
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,840
They can't listen to me anymore.

429
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,700
I was really upset.

430
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,370
I really started to believe that there was no one to tell,

431
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,530
no one that mattered.

432
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,660
And then I realized there was still you.

433
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,310
And in a strange way,

434
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,730
you're the only onewho ever really mattered anyway.

435
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:14,420
Because, Debra,you're still next.

436
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,890
Wow.You're like a dog with a bone.

437
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,030
Listen.
Follow my reasoning.

438
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,530
Victim number four's head was never completely severed from her body.

439
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,900
So the killer didn't leave victim number three's head in its place.

440
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,530
Which means it's still out there.

441
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,460
Which means it could still be placed on your body after the killer kills you.

442
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,940
If you stay in this hotel...

443
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,940
Allison, you already made this prediction,

444
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,800
and I'm happy to say it didn't come true.

445
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,330
No.I was right about everything except for the numbers.

446
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,680
It all still works if you're the fifth victim.

447
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,840
If you're next.

448
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,680
In my dream, he said there were five victims.

449
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,420
I saw victim number three's head on your body.

450
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,170
I just assumed it was a natural mistake,

451
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,280
but now I have figured it out.You're next.

452
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,080
Allison, you're not making any sense again.

453
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,340
If you were really concerned about me--

454
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,410
if you did actually see the third killing--

455
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,780
wouldn't it just be a whole lot easier to tell everyone who did it?

456
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,450
Who the killer is?

457
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:19,320
No.Because it wouldn't clarify anything.

458
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,710
And actually,

459
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:27,130
I'm beginning to believe that there must be two killers.

460
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,110
Two killers?

461
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,670
In my dream...

462
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:38,340
the person that I saw kill Cheryl Ann Potts

463
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,890
was Pamela Franklin.

464
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,510
Dead Pamela Franklin?
The fourth victim?

465
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,030
Which is the reason I believe there are two killers--

466
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,890
Pamela Franklin and the person who killed

467
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,930
- Pamela Franklin.
- Pamela Franklin.

468
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,510
So come on.
Just...

469
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,060
just do it.
Just change hotels.

470
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,980
You really are crazier than I thought.

471
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,440
Truly certifiable.

472
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,380
And you know the craziest part?

473
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,740
You know how I absolutely know you're out of your mind?

474
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:16,000
After all I've done to you, you are still here trying to save my life.

475
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,270
Okay.
Ooh!You're right.

476
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,220
You know what?
I'm crazy.Cuckoo!Cuckoo!

477
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,300
Yeah, I'm crazy.

478
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,740
So just, you know...
just humor me.

479
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,510
Come on.
What will happen?Nothing.

480
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,200
You'll still be alive.
I'll still be crazy.

481
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,090
You can laugh about the delusional lady

482
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,620
who talked you into changing hotel rooms in Phoenix.

483
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,310
You can even...

484
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,390
you can even write a chapter of your book about it.

485
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,080
Come on.
What's the downside?

486
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,230
I'll even help you pack.

487
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,140
But what if I'm wrong?

488
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:49,730
What if you're not delusional?
No.

489
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,420
I'm going to be as good to you as you're being to me.

490
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,000
I think I'm going to stay here, and let the recapitator come and get me.

491
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,240
I mean, think about it.

492
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,700
If it's true-- if you're right--

493
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:07,290
then it would be a great vindication of you and everything you stand for.

494
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,830
I owe you that.

495
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,380
Now leave.

496
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:17,060
Or I'll call the police.

497
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,330
And I'm reasonably sure they'll listen to everything I have to say.

498
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,740
Hi, Elizabeth.

499
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,280
Listen, I know that I don't have an appointment,

500
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,020
but I was just wondering if i could get two minutes with him.

501
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,500
I have these papers that he asked me to sign.

502
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,850
I just wanted to find out about a couple of things.

503
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,530
Let me stick my head in there,see what I can do.

504
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,030
Well, this is embarrassing.

505
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,830
I don't know how I...

506
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,670
What?

507
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,470
He's actually not in there--he's off-site today.

508
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,910
Mr. Dubois, please...

509
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,790
- Hello, Joe.
- Hello, Marcus.

510
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:19,060
I brought your papers back.
They're signed.

511
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,440
That's all right.

512
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:26,170
I'm afraid the insurance company had a change of heart about you.

513
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,650
I know that they became nervous when you didn't sign at first.

514
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,340
Well, what can I do to calm them down?

515
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,430
I'm not going to sue, Marcus,I promise you.

516
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,040
I just want to go back to work--

517
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,940
I just want things to go back to the way they were a month ago.

518
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,900
Joe, if I can't insure you,

519
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,190
I can't bring you back.

520
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,940
Of course you can--this is your company, I'm your employee,

521
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:46,860
you know me.

522
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,360
Yes, Joe, it is my company,

523
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,540
but if I violate my agreements with my insurers,

524
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,680
I will have no company,no government contracts, no lines of credit.

525
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,250
300-and-some-odd people will be out of work.

526
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,000
I'm sorry.

527
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,400
You're backing me into a corner, Marcus.

528
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,030
You see that, don't you?

529
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,730
I mean, if you don't bring me back,

530
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,360
I-I'm gonna have no choice,I have to sue you.

531
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,110
I know-- but that we're covered for.

532
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,660
I like having sandwiches for dinner.

533
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,580
I think we should always have sandwiches for dinner.

534
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,400
It's just funner than hot food.

535
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,630
Quiet, Bridge.

536
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,850
Mom and dad are thinking.

537
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,550
$4,382--

538
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,330
that's the minimum that we've got to come up with each month.

539
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:47,170
That's mortgage,car insurance, food.

540
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,580
$4,500-- that's the magic number.

541
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:41,050
Honey, how much am I worth?

542
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,660
Baby...

543
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,270
you're worth everything to me.

544
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:52,390
no.
I mean, money.

545
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,640
Well...
let's see.

546
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,680
My late wife was worth about...

547
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,630
$88 million, so...

548
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,770
as soon as you become Mrs. Walter Paxton,

549
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,190
you'll be worth 44.

550
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:18,360
and when will that be?
When will I get to be Mrs. Walter Paxton?

551
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:22,090
Well, it can't be too soon.
That would be...

552
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,640
unseemly.

553
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,780
Do you miss her?

554
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,930
You miss your wife?

555
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:32,950
Pamela, I slit her throat,

556
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:37,790
then I cut off her head with an electric knife,

557
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:41,310
and kept it in formaldehyde for six months.

558
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,430
If I did miss her,

559
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:47,480
I'd have no one to blame but myself, wouldn't you think?

560
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,310
I love you, Pamela.

561
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,580
I think that's pretty clear.

562
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,000
I love you, too, Walter.

563
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,670
I know.

564
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,940
I knew it the second you said yes,

565
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,640
the second you said you'd kill that woman for me, both of them.

566
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,330
How could I say no?

567
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,740
It was such a great plan.

568
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:22,510
You kill your wife,give her head to me,

569
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,530
and go to jail--but six months later,

570
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:29,450
I kill a random woman and leave your wife's head behind,

571
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,190
so they know it couldn't have been you,

572
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:37,080
and two days later,I do it again, just so they're sure.

573
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,340
And then we live happily ever after...

574
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,350
get married.

575
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,260
Well, after tonight.

576
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,660
That's right, after tonight.

577
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,580
One more tonight.

578
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,350
Who's the lucky lady?

579
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,500
That would be you.

580
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,280
ask me again how much you're worth.

581
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:37,020
Writer found headless
in hotel room

582
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:41,560
Tomorrow morning, I will be convening a meeting of every detective on the force.

583
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,210
There's going to be a lot of changes made in the way we do things around here.

584
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,020
And I just, I want to be clear.

585
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,680
I don't see a bright future for you here in Phoenix.

586
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,170
Hey.

587
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,940
Well, look who's here.

588
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:06,120
Aren't you the lady who predicted P.D.Mccall's murder?

589
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,140
Allow me to introduce myself.

590
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,820
I'm the guy who canceled her round-the-clock protection

591
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,910
so that your prediction could come true.

592
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,640
I went to look for you at police headquarters.

593
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,830
They said they thought you were here.

594
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,270
Yeah, well...

595
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,510
this new substitute D.A.
Van dyke's taken a special shine to me.

596
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:27,560
I'm heading out right now to key his car.
You want to come?

597
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,830
- I had another dream.
- Fabulous.Was I in it?

598
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,320
More importantly,was I employed?

599
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,250
We were right.

600
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,610
We were right the whole time,it was Paxton.

601
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,680
Walter Paxton killed his wife.

602
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,220
His lover was Pamela Franklin.

603
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,730
She killed all the others to convince the world that he was innocent,

604
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,990
then he killed her.

605
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,660
And I'm figuring, last night,he killed P.D.Mccall.

606
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,000
Really?
Walter Paxton?

607
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,950
The man we already prosecuted and released?

608
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:53,730
The man who's suing the city for $50 million?

609
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,150
That Walter Paxton?

610
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,910
Come on.
Come on, Lee.

611
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,970
You just admitted I was right about P.D.Mccall,

612
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,110
and I'm telling you,I'm right about this, too.

613
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,750
Let's go tell that Van Dyke guy.

614
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,870
Van Dick?
I don't think so.

615
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,050
You know how he's spinning this to the press?

616
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,200
You didn't predict it,you inspired it.

617
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,850
By making this crazy prediction, you gave this lunatic a fabulous new target.

618
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,030
And me, I'm the idiot who left her vulnerable to the attack.

619
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,230
I don't care what he thinks about me.

620
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,290
And you shouldn't care what anybody thinks about you.

621
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,580
We just have to get Paxton.

622
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,140
We're not going to get Paxton,no one is.

623
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,560
Walter Paxton's bulletproof.

624
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,540
At this point, nobody can accuse him of anything.

625
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,720
I'm telling you, if he got caught robbing a bank tomorrow,

626
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,950
they'd have a parade for him.

627
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,120
He personally murdered three people,

628
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,940
and he helped plan the murder of two others.

629
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,430
That's all well and good,allison, but you don't have any evidence.

630
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,620
Your dreams are not evidence.

631
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,680
Would it be possible for you to get me into debra's hotel room?

632
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,270
It's 4:45 in the morning.

633
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,730
I need you out of here before the techies show up again at 8:00.

634
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,740
That shouldn't be a problem.

635
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,010
I'm sorry to leave you on your own, but I got to run home and shower.

636
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,500
My fellow incompetent detectives and

637
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,640
I have been summoned to the conference room at 7:00 A.M.

638
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,190
For what I know is gonna be a truly inspirational ball busting.

639
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,410
It'll be fine.

640
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,870
Come on, debra.

641
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:36,210
Talk to me,show me something.

642
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,570
hello?

643
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,670
Is this the same case you were working on yesterday?

644
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,740
I'm guessing you're a lawyer.

645
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,860
Oh, no.I didn't actually finish law school.

646
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,720
I work for the district attorney--

647
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,430
uh, Manuel Devalos.

648
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,340
Sounds impressive.

649
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,690
I feel so badly for you.

650
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,490
I feel so badly for your boss.

651
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,940
They're just destroying him on television.

652
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,760
I know.

653
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,350
I can't help but think a lot of that's my fault.

654
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,860
- How do you mean?
- Before Paxton...

655
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,540
this is a surprise.

656
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,970
Is this a bad time?

657
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,410
Absolutely not, no.
Come in.

658
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,800
Thanks.

659
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,300
Excuse the mess.

660
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,990
Forgive me, I'm expecting a call.

661
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,550
Can I get you a drink?
A mini drink from my minibar?

662
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,120
No, I'm good.

663
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,330
I was, uh...

664
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,540
thinking about our conversation the other day.

665
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,580
You called it.

666
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,640
I've only been out three days, and already I'm broke.

667
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:17,190
So I was wondering if we could have one more conversation about that book deal.

668
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:19,940
You did say something about an advance?

669
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,450
Would $10,000 tide you over?

670
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,420
I think if you were willing to sign some papers in the morning,

671
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:35,820
I'm fairly sure my publisher could come up with at least that fairly quickly.

672
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,200
That would be a lifesaver.

673
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,220
So...
what do you hear?

674
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,460
Are the police any closer to figuring out who's doing this?

675
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,440
Well, I did hear one really nutty theory today.

676
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,330
But it's not going to make you feel any better.

677
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,750
It's pretty out there.

678
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,430
What's that?

679
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,660
- Two killers.
- Two killers?

680
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,050
are you sitting down?

681
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,990
Obviously you are.
I can see that.

682
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:11,080
Pamela Franklin and whoever killed Pamela Franklin.

683
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,550
Pamela Franklin?

684
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,020
Well, I don't get that.

685
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:19,440
Why would she kill all those people?

686
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,660
And who's saying that?
Is it the police?

687
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:27,140
And who are they saying Pamela Franklin killed, everybody except herself?

688
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,080
No, I don't get that.

689
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,600
I don't know if the person who told me this even knows.

690
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,310
And, no, it's not the police,not really.

691
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:39,770
Yeah, I think the thinking was that

692
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,870
Pamela killed everyone and then someone killed her.

693
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,330
But nobody is saying who that someone might be?

694
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,840
And why would that woman want to kill my wife?

695
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,610
Well, you don't know.

696
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,450
This may have nothing to do with your wife.

697
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,590
It may only be about...

698
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,670
the second victim.

699
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,880
And all the other deaths were committed to throw people off the scent.

700
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,070
Or it could have been about the third victim.

701
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:10,190
But you know what?I haven't really given it much thought, but the truth is

702
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:14,210
women don't really do these things, not on their own.

703
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:18,750
Go into a hotel room and cut off someone's head?No.

704
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,290
I'm betting when the smoke clears,

705
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,750
if she was doing it,she was doing it for a man.

706
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:27,660
Not to sound sexist, but it's always a man.

707
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:31,430
She was in love with someone,someone she couldn't have and...

708
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,030
and?

709
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,410
And nothing.

710
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,570
We have a problem.

711
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:56,170
- What's that?
- I didn't bring my tools.

712
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:13,000
don't go away.

713
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:27,990
All right, ladies and gentlemen, five women are dead now--

714
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:32,140
all brutally murdered by the same sociopath.

715
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,620
Are you embarrassed?
Are you ashamed?

716
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,730
I know I am.

717
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,500
Our local hotels and restaurants are losing millions in revenue.

718
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,350
Our convention center is empty.

719
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,450
Every day brings a new cancellation.

720
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:53,020
Well, I won't have it,not on my watch.

721
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:58,590
I'm not going down like my predecessor.

722
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:03,160
I like being the new D.A. of Phoenix.

723
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,150
Well, before you get too comfortable...

724
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,120
I would appreciate it

725
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:14,350
if you would issue an arrest warrant for Walter Paxton in the death of P.D. Mccall.

726
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:17,480
Here's the evidence,on this tape recorder.

727
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,310
You can thank me later.
