00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:02,790
Who's that?

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,090
Terry Kavanaugh! The John D.
Rockefeller of solar energy.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,130
It's from Meghan.

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,910
What is she doing, buying you a robe?

6
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,800
I don't know.

7
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,260
There's nothing going on!

8
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,650
The other night,I'm
working in my office.

9
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,800
She walks in, she's
all drunk off her ass...

10
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,280
I know! I already
dreamt it! I saw it all!

11
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,760
You did? Then why didn't you tell me?

12
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,550
No! That is not the question.

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,540
The question is, why didn't you tell me?

14
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,130
I'm going to go in there in the morning.
I'm going to tell her there's no company.

15
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,970
Are you insane?

16
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,940
this is going to work.

17
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,220
You're going to give me my idea back.

18
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,240
We're going to close down this business.

19
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,390
Do you understand?

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,630
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,960
Manuel. Thank you.

23
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,370
I appreciate you coming
over at this very early hour.

24
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,670
Why all the drama,Tom?
It's 7:00 in the morning.

25
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,260
- I have a campaign to run, a practice to tend to.
- No. I know.

26
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:24,500
I have a friend, just discovered he's got
a fairly advanced case of prostate cancer.

27
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,460
And he asked me if I knew of any attorneys in town who
could be trusted to do a bunch of probate work quickly.

28
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,110
Wants to make sure his,um...

29
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,730
his family's taken care of.

30
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,790
So,how are you going to do it?

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,350
I don't know. I mean,I've
been thinking about that.

32
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,090
I think I just have to tell
her and take my chances.

33
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,100
I think so,too.

34
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,350
- Hello?
- Hello.

35
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,560
My name's Charles Winters.

36
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,910
I'm a tax attorney over
at Phelps and Kingman.

37
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,400
I'm looking for Allison Dubois.

38
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,420
Well,this is Allison Dubois.

39
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,070
I got your number from Larry Watt.

40
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,510
He indicated that he had hired you on a
freelance basis a couple of months back,

41
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,800
and I was wondering if I might
be able to do the same thing.

42
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,490
I see you got my text.

43
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,870
Okay. So what's all
the excitement about?

44
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,280
Oh,my gosh. It's the end
of the world as we know it.

45
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,120
Mr. Winters? This is Mrs. Dubois.

46
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,680
Thanks.

47
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,750
thank you for coming in.
I'm Charles Winters. Please.

48
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,140
Uh,well,frankly, I'm a little puzzled.

49
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,200
You mentioned on the phone
that you were a tax attorney?

50
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,590
The work that I've done with Larry Watt and
former District Attorney Devalos is,uh...

51
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,130
Almost all of it was
of a criminal nature.

52
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,190
Actually,I'm not interested in hiring
you to help me with a professional matter.

53
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,500
It's about my wife.

54
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,500
Uh,my... house... really.

55
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,080
She thinks it's haunted.

56
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,320
This is great that you've
actually got the time to do this.

57
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,320
Kelly is going to be
thrilled. She loves this house.

58
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,200
I mean,she's actually the
one who found it. She,um...

59
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:24,000
I mean... It actually
wasn't even for sale.

60
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,800
Took me days to convince
the people that owned it,

61
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,150
and the truth is,we
paid too much for it.

62
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,960
You must really love your wife.

63
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,870
I do. Yeah.

64
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,940
That's why I can't stand
to see her like this.

65
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:46,480
I've got clients all over the Southwest,
and when I have to be gone overnight...

66
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,300
What?

67
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,260
She hears things.

68
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,090
What kind of things?

69
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,070
Water.

70
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,250
She hears water... running.

71
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,820
And then sometimes, she hears crying.

72
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,420
A baby crying.

73
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,170
But you never hear it? It
never happens when you're there?

74
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:15,420
I'm just hoping that if you say there
are no ghosts, there can be no baby...

75
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,930
there can be no water, then...

76
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,810
there won't be.

77
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:32,130
hey partner, yohoo! I'm back!

78
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,370
Oh,good. You got it.

79
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,870
I was worried when I
didn't hear from you.

80
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,340
Does it fit? Of course
it fits. It's a robe.

81
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,990
You know what?

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,880
Give me five minutes to settle
in, and then come into my office.

83
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,400
I'll fill you in on everything.

84
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,790
God,it is good to be back.

85
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,390
Why would you send me
a $2,200 cashmere robe?

86
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,590
I don't know. I-I just...

87
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,190
I didn't really want to have
to carry it on the plane.

88
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,460
That's not what I mean.

89
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,160
You know that's not what I mean.

90
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,670
No,I don't. What do you mean?

91
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,420
I mean,it's a robe. It's
intimate. And that card.

92
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,810
What about the card?

93
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,280
I thought it was a lovely card.

94
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,670
You didn't like the card?

95
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,420
After the other night?
After the promises you made?

96
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,400
No,I didn't like the card.

97
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,690
I didn't like the card.
I don't like the robe.

98
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,210
My wife doesn't like the robe.

99
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,340
Whoa,whoa,whoa,wait a second.

100
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,100
Your wife has a problem with the robe?

101
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,100
I think we're all having a
gigantic misunderstanding here.

102
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,640
It's a robe. It's cashmere.

103
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,350
It's a luxury item.

104
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,490
It speaks to the fact that I believe you and
I are going to make a lot of money together.

105
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,840
That's all it is.

106
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,390
It's not like I bought
you silk underwear.

107
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,190
You know what? I need to call your wife.

108
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,840
I need to straighten this out.

109
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,060
You don't need to call
anyone. You've said enough.

110
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,680
You've written enough.
You've done enough.

111
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,780
Listen to me,Meghan. I'm done.

112
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:11,090
I'm dissolving the business. I'm
taking my marbles. I'm going home.

113
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,540
- No.
- No what?

114
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,640
No,you are not dissolving the business.

115
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,990
It is not your business to dissolve.

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,010
I own 51% of it.

117
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,110
I own 51% of you.

118
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,920
So,give me the freaking
robe. I'll take it back.

119
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,700
I'll send your wife some flowers, and let's
get back to doing what we know we have to do.

120
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,840
Excuse me.

121
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,130
Where do you think you're going?

122
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,490
Don't worry. You'll be
hearing from me again.

123
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,910
There he is.

124
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,240
Lynn.

125
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,520
Good to see you.

126
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,090
Lee.

127
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,260
Okay,enough small talk.

128
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,390
What the hell was going on over there?

129
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,370
We saw you cavorting with that weasel.

130
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,180
He's dying.

131
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,430
- Are you serious?
- Oh,my God.

132
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,830
Okay. I feel horrible,
but you guys were laughing.

133
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,180
You both looked so happy.

134
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,120
We've known each other a long time.

135
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,400
He,the mayor,
the governor--

136
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:30,400
they all want me to step in,
finish out my current term.

137
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:35,480
Obviously,Tom's gonna withdraw his
candidacy, and I'll end up running unopposed.

138
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,840
I haven't even had a chance
to call and tell Lily.

139
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,860
Well,congratulations...

140
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,770
- I guess.
- Yeah.

141
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,860
I know exactly what you mean.

142
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,890
Do you want to hear something strange?

143
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,610
Absolutely. That's what we're all starved
for around here is something strange.

144
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,300
He wants to meet with Allison Dubois.

145
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,600
He said he'd consider it a personal favor if I'd
intercede and help smooth things over with her,

146
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,180
get her to meet with him.

147
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,810
It usually starts around 10:00, just after
I've gone to bed, once the house is dark,

148
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,930
and only if I'm alone.

149
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,970
It goes on for about an
hour, and then it stops.

150
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,020
I know it's impossible.

151
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,200
The man Charles hired showed me that
there weren't any water pipes in that wall,

152
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,120
so,that's weird.

153
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,420
But,uh,it's still just
the sound of water.

154
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,080
It doesn't frighten me that much.

155
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,530
But when the baby cries...

156
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,130
He sounds so frightened and unhappy.

157
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,740
Isn't that tile awful?

158
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,570
I'm sure we'll never have
the money to replace it.

159
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,160
We're in so much debt now, and there
are so many things we want to do.

160
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,960
Your house is really beautiful.

161
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,710
Very lovely.

162
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,450
Uh,so I'm curious.

163
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,870
I think we're both curious.
Any first impressions?

164
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,270
Anything you want to share?

165
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,760
Uh,well, you have a beautiful home.

166
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,070
A very lovely home.

167
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,890
Um,other than that, I-I'm
sorry to say that I don't...

168
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,800
I don't see anything.

169
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,170
I don't sense anything.

170
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,420
You know,of course,it's
the middle of the day.

171
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,230
And obviously,you're not
here by yourself,so...

172
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,680
You know,it doesn't make you wrong.

173
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,500
It doesn't make me right.
It's just a first impression.

174
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,140
I called seven lawyers.

175
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,800
I left messages,haven't
heard back from a single one.

176
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,670
Well,that's okay. I'm loaded.

177
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,910
I made $300 today,

178
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,580
explaining in the nicest way possible to
this attorney's wife that in all likelihood--

179
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,820
even though she hears
noises in her house--

180
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,750
that her house is almost
certainly not haunted.

181
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,180
Well,that probably made her feel better.

182
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,520
I don't know.

183
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,940
You should have seen the look
on her face when I told her.

184
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:15,260
I'm afraid that all I did was
convince her that she's crazy.

185
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,570
There,there.

186
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,880
it's all right. Mommy's got you.

187
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,220
It's all right.

188
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,800
Okay. It's going to be all right.

189
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:01,600
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

190
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,640
Hello.

191
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,440
Hey,sorry.

192
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,600
I tried to get to it before it
woke you,but you beat me to it.

193
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,650
Was it for me?

194
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,030
No,it was your friendly neighborhood
she-devil-- Meghan Doyle.

195
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,200
She's having some papers drawn up.

196
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,250
She wants to show them to me at 11:30.

197
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,600
Dissolution papers,right?

198
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,150
Papers to end the company?

199
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,290
Yeah,I can only assume so.

200
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,010
What are you working on
so furiously over here?

201
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,850
Well,you're going to find this hard to
believe, but I had a dream last night.

202
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,250
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- That's okay.

203
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,200
I know that I told you yesterday
I didn't see anything in your house

204
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,300
and I didn't feel
anything in your house.

205
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:11,270
Well,last night I had a dream and it
seemed to take place in your house.

206
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,170
It was a long time
ago-- 20 years or so.

207
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,390
So I woke up this morning,
and I,I went on the Internet.

208
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,730
It didn't take me
terribly long to find this.

209
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,120
Oh,my God.

210
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,910
A little boy died in our house.

211
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Drowned by accident.

212
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:40,110
The version of events I saw last
night was somewhat more... violent.

213
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,160
Jonathan McKenzie.

214
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,880
His mother was distracted by the
television and he drowned in the bathtub.

215
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,480
Do you think that's
why I hear what I hear?

216
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,180
I can't answer that.

217
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,720
It may be that you're a little like me,

218
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,260
that you have...sensitivities.

219
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,230
Sensitive... not crazy.

220
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,710
Sensitive. I like that.

221
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,440
If you'll excuse me for a moment.

222
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,570
Like I said, it took me about ten
minutes to come across these stories.

223
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,250
Mr. Winters, you're a lawyer.

224
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,150
Surely you were aware of this.

225
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,150
Not when we bought the house.

226
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,750
After she started hearing
things,sure, I did some research.

227
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,140
- I found what you found.
- And you didn't tell her?

228
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,520
Tell her what?

229
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:55,770
That we just sunk our life savings--
more than our life savings--

230
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,540
into a house where
someone had an accident?

231
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,510
No,I didn't tell her that.

232
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,960
I don't believe in ghosts.

233
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,280
I don't think that our
place is really haunted,

234
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,030
but I do believe in
the power of suggestion,

235
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,630
and I honestly thought that you
would come over, look around,

236
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,420
and say either we were poltergeist-free
or chant some mumbo jumbo

237
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,130
and she would believe that we were.

238
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,730
Well,sorry I let you down.

239
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,450
You have no idea the can of
worms that you have just opened.

240
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,440
She is going to want to move now.

241
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,540
She is going to want to sell
and we cannot afford to do that.

242
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,770
You are talking about
your wife's peace of mind.

243
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,470
Can you really afford
not to,Mr. Winters?

244
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,410
You two have a lot to talk about.

245
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,940
Boy,you don't waste any time.

246
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,460
Come in.

247
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,000
is that I'm surrendering all my
rights to,to everything,right?

248
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:07,750
It says you're divesting your
49% ownership in Dubois-Doyle,yes.

249
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,210
This wasn't my idea.

250
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,770
This is not something I want.

251
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,070
Wait a second. What's this?

252
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,230
What's what?

253
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,070
It says something about a
quarter of a million dollars.

254
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,830
Does this say that I owe you
a quarter of a million dollars?

255
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,280
No.

256
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,400
It says upon the tender of your signature--
as soon as you sign these papers--

257
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,850
I'm giving you a quarter
of a million dollars.

258
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,900
Why would you do that?

259
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:44,680
I promised you I'd invest
$300,000 in your idea,Joe.

260
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,470
Between the office, our
expenses,the models, our travel,

261
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,670
you do the math.

262
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,050
A quarter of a million dollars?

263
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,680
That's what it says. I've reread that page
of the agreement 16 times.

264
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,940
And she's going to
give that money to you?

265
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,290
To us,yeah.

266
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,200
Well,I mean,in return for signing this
agreement, in return for signing over everything.

267
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,450
I mean,I don't get
anything until I sign.

268
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,340
But you are going to sign it?

269
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,280
Of course I am. It's just... do
you think maybe we misjudged her?

270
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,640
What?

271
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,000
Let me think about that a minute. No.

272
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,400
She is paying you that money 'cause she's betting
she's going to make a lot more money down the road.

273
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,030
Yeah,of course,you're right.

274
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,380
Which is the other reason I called.

275
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,110
You want to go out
and celebrate tonight?

276
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,870
Oh,I would love to, but Devalos just called me and
asked me to meet him at Tom Van Dyke's office at 7:00,

277
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,830
but I-I could call him
and try to reschedule.

278
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,420
Don't you think we should wait
till we really have the money?

279
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,320
Hmm,that's awfully
damn adult of you,dear.

280
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:51,510
Sorry,I didn't mean to be
so "awfully damn adult."

281
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,570
They gave him his job back.

282
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,180
That's amazing.

283
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,030
Does that mean that
you get your job back?

284
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,000
As soon as I want.

285
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,760
It's so weird how things work.

286
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,020
I mean,you think you know the course
of things, how things are going to go.

287
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,960
Well,you got to feel bad for Van Dyke.

288
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,540
He wants me to meet with him.
Although I'm not sure why.

289
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,040
So where are we going to go
celebrate tomorrow,rich guy?

290
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,560
What makes you think we're
going to get the money tomorrow?

291
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,210
Well,did you check all the papers?

292
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,150
Yeah,only about a hundred times.

293
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,470
Does your right hand work,yeah?

294
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,070
So where are we going
to celebrate tomorrow?

295
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,570
Tell me again why we got
to wait till tomorrow.

296
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,260
Hello.

297
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,500
Allison,it's Lee.Sorry to call so late,

298
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,930
but I was summoned over here
to a house on Fremont Lane.

299
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,450
Apparently,you know these people. I was
talking to the husband. He mentioned your name.

300
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,200
Wait,I was half asleep.

301
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,840
Where are you? What's going on?

302
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,320
The Winters' home--
Charles and Kelly Winters.

303
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:11,370
About an hour and a half ago, Kelly Winters
swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills,

304
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,310
***hot bath. And killed herself.

305
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,100
YOUNG BRIDE TAKES OWN
LIFE IN CURSED HOUSE

306
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:23,020
Kids are safely ensconced in school,

307
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,910
and I just got off the
phone with Meghan Doyle.

308
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,490
She wants to sign the
papers today at The Belmont.

309
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,990
This was in with the mail.

310
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,680
Somebody must have just
put it in the mailbox.

311
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,130
Been waiting an hour and 20 minutes.

312
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,250
- What the hell do you think is taking 'em so long?
- Dad...

313
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,760
You sure you don't want a lawyer?

314
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,680
Because I know I can get your
mother to pay for a lawyer.

315
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,980
I don't need a lawyer. They just
want to ask me some questions.

316
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,600
Mr. Winters.

317
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,550
- This your attorney?
- I'm Sam Winters. I'm Charles' father.

318
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,400
I'm down here helping
my son with the funeral.

319
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,090
Well,it's nice to meet you,sir, but I'm
going to need you to wait outside here

320
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,540
while we talk to your son.

321
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,170
She said she wouldn't live in
a house where a child had died.

322
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,840
She couldn't bear to
hear him cry anymore.

323
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:16,600
I don't understand.

324
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,760
Why not just put the house on the
market, find another place to live?

325
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:24,710
I know. That's,that's what Kelly
wanted to do, but it's not that easy.

326
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,800
We overpaid.

327
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,910
The market is down.

328
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,490
I just... I honestly... I couldn't...

329
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,750
see how that it was possible or,

330
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,430
or really why it was even necessary,

331
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,810
and we had a really big fight about it.

332
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,130
So she went on a drive.

333
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,890
What'd you do while she was gone?

334
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:52,090
I had a couple of scotches
and fell asleep on the couch.

335
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,740
Then when I woke up,

336
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:01,960
I could hear the sound of water,
an-and I-I thought it was a joke.

337
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,750
When I walked into the bathroom,I...

338
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,830
She was so still. She...

339
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,530
I loved her so much.

340
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,840
Mr. Winters,while you were
sitting out there waiting for us,

341
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,650
I went ahead and got a
warrant to search your home.

342
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,910
We looked in the attic above
the bedroom and found this.

343
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,710
What is that?

344
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,100
It's a white noise machine.

345
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,600
It helps people fall asleep.

346
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,440
It makes sounds like a
babbling brook or an ocean.

347
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,960
Even has a convenient timer on the back,

348
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,270
so if you were going out of town you could
set it to go off in the middle of the night.

349
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,740
Mr. Winters, could you take a look at this
and tell me if you recognize the handwriting.

350
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,390
What is this?

351
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,780
This is Kelly's handwriting.
Where did you get this?

352
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,810
I found it in my mailbox this morning.

353
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,790
I'm guessing Kelly left it there last
night when she went for that drive.

354
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,240
The letter's pretty clear,Mr. Winters.

355
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,220
Your wife believed you
meant to do her harm.

356
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,550
What?

357
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,180
She writes if anything happens to her, anything
at all, we should look very closely at you.

358
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,260
In fact, she specifically
says that she's not suicidal.

359
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,000
What-what-what are...
what are you saying?

360
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,610
I don't...

361
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:22,060
believe that you're saying
that I murdered my wife

362
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,100
and then I made it look
like it was a suicide.

363
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,880
We aren't saying it,Charles.

364
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,560
Kelly is.

365
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,660
Mr. Winters,you have the
right to remain silent.

366
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:33,120
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

367
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,980
You have the right to an attorney.

368
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,360
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed for you.

369
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,230
Thank you,Joe.

370
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,800
And thank you.

371
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:56,510
I'm sorry things didn't work out the way you
hoped, but at least this way it's not a total loss.

372
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,880
You know,I have to tell you,I
completely regret leaving my idea behind.

373
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,920
Um,and there were times when we
were working together that I,uh,

374
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:10,270
I actually, I literally
wanted to kill you.

375
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,040
But this is actually
extraordinarily decent of you.

376
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,050
And I know that we're probably
never gonna see each other again,

377
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,640
but I just want you to know that I think
that you're basically a good person,Meghan.

378
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,750
And I too regret that
things didn't work out.

379
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,760
Oh,Joe...

380
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,930
I can't believe you said that.

381
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,510
I can't believe you think that.

382
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,580
I mean I think that you tried your best.

383
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,180
You are a lovely man.

384
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,870
And I am happy that
check makes you so happy.

385
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,860
But,Joe... God,you're
smart, and God,you're thick.

386
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,020
Excuse me?

387
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,980
Who is that?

388
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,470
That's my smart,but thick.

389
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,080
That's my husband. He's early.

390
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,500
Your husband?

391
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,030
Does he know about your boyfriend?

392
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,180
Does he know what you tried with me?

393
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,080
Joe.

394
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,940
There was no boyfriend.
There was never a boyfriend.

395
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,780
And don't hate me...

396
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,990
but there were no patent
problems in Eastern Europe either.

397
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,500
While you were sitting watching
the phone at the office,

398
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,510
I was at home watching
DVDs with my husband.

399
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,170
What are you talking about?

400
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,130
I needed to make you uncomfortable.

401
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,070
I needed to make you want to
sell me your half of the business.

402
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,270
And now you have. And now
you're happy. And now I'm happy.

403
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,540
It's how it had to be.

404
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,320
We could have never worked
together. Not long-term.

405
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,100
I mean... you're smart. And I'm smart.

406
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,460
We're just different kinds of smart.

407
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,790
Order a drink,Joe.

408
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,930
Go ahead. Celebrate. I have a tab here.

409
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,840
Order whatever you like.

410
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,290
So I run to the bank. And
thank God the check cleared.

411
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,550
But I can't help it.
My head is spinning.

412
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,250
And I'm starting to feel like
the biggest fool on the planet.

413
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,260
I think some of this might be my fault.

414
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,380
I think maybe you
sensed my insecurities.

415
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,500
- I think maybe she sensed my insecurities.
- No. No. No,it had nothing to do with you.

416
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,830
She had a plan. She had
a plan from the beginning.

417
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,420
So now,all I'm thinking of is that she was in Albuquerque
meeting for two days with that Terry Cavanaugh.

418
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:30,580
And she probably sold him my idea
for ten times what she paid me.

419
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,580
Oh,Joe.

420
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,270
So I go home and I start
calling Stratosphere Aeronautics,

421
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,410
and I'm asking to speak to
this Terry Cavanaugh guy.

422
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,840
And of course they don't connect me.

423
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,560
And then it hits me.

424
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:44,630
I mean I just got paid a quarter of a million
dollars for my first independent invention.

425
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,780
And I only had the damn
idea a whole two months ago.

426
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,310
And now we're sitting on more money
than we've ever had in our entire lives.

427
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,770
And I know we're not set.

428
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,210
I mean,I know I still got to
go out there and get a job.

429
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:59,210
But,I mean,it sure beats
working at the car wash.

430
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,140
So you ready to go out and celebrate?

431
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,590
Yes,I am.

432
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,600
Is that you,baby?

433
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,450
Are you hiding in there?

434
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,020
It's only Mama.

435
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,300
Don't be frightened.

436
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,710
Baby?

437
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,010
No! Mommy,please!

438
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:46,040
Don't do this! Please! Don't do this!

439
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,360
I'll do anything you want.

440
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:53,350
There is nothing to
do! Do you understand?

441
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,170
It is over for all of us.

442
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,580
Not now. Go away!

443
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:02,470
- Daddy!Daddy,help me.Please,Daddy!
- Kelly!

444
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,120
Come back here! Kelly!

445
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,480
Okay,so what you're
telling me is a little girl

446
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,150
who lived in the Winters'
house 20 years ago...

447
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,240
Kelly McKenzie.

448
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:20,050
Kelly McKenzie has the same first
name as Charles Winters' late wife.

449
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,190
Sorry,what does that prove?

450
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,470
It doesn't prove
anything, but it is a fact.

451
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,990
Now,what if they're the same person?

452
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,330
It should be easy enough to check if
Charles's late wife's maiden is McKenzie.

453
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,260
But it isn't. I mean, at least not
according to the death certificate.

454
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,870
But maybe she changed it.

455
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,250
Okay,I'll play.

456
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,950
Let's pretend she changed it.

457
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,710
I still don't see where we're going.

458
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,990
Well,I'm not 100% sure on this either,

459
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,160
but I keep dreaming about the
death of this little McKenzie boy.

460
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:50,140
And the version that I see,
his death is no accident.

461
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,780
His mother drowns him on purpose.

462
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,960
And there's a little girl
there, a little girl named Kelly.

463
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,320
And she sees it all.

464
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,340
Well,I must be dreaming
this for a reason.

465
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,570
Hello?

466
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,970
This is Joe Dubois.

467
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,580
Terry Cavanaugh?

468
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,700
It's you.

469
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,770
They said it was going to be someone
from the district attorney's office.

470
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:23,310
As of today I'm with the
district attorney's office.

471
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,780
You gotta laugh.

472
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:43,780
I hired you to help calm my wife down and
now the city's hired you to help put me away.

473
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,460
I'm not an attorney,Charles.

474
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,970
The city's hired me to help them
figure out what really happened,

475
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,070
which is why I wanted to talk to you.

476
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,330
I have some... some hunches. Some ideas.

477
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,520
But without knowing more about Kelly...

478
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,520
they really don't make a lot of sense.

479
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,750
Well,you better not ask me.

480
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,410
Because,uh,when it comes to Kelly, I don't
think that I'm really the expert I thought I was.

481
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,630
You know,I loved her...

482
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,860
more than anyone or
anything I have ever loved.

483
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:25,130
That... that... that letter,
it makes no sense to me.

484
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,940
According to Kelly's death certificate,
it says that her maiden name is Anderson,

485
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,450
that she was born in California.

486
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,950
Do you have any reason
to suspect otherwise?

487
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,170
What are you talking about?

488
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,190
I don't know. Do you know
of any brothers or sisters?

489
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,310
Have you ever met
anyone from her family?

490
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,180
Her father? Her mother?

491
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:49,920
No. No,there was no one else to meet.

492
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:53,090
Growing up she said it was
just her and her crazy mother.

493
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,270
Her mother's dead?

494
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,260
Before I came along.

495
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:00,330
And she referred to her as "crazy"?

496
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,980
Yeah. We had bad parenting in common.

497
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,150
Two crazy mothers. Two crappy fathers.

498
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,860
Her dad was never around.

499
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:13,550
My dad was practically a lap dog
because my mother had all the money.

500
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,140
I guess you could say
that we bonded over that.

501
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,230
And the two of you met how?

502
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,400
Uh,she chose me.

503
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:28,480
It was,uh, like a movie.

504
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,670
The prettiest girl in the bar just
walks up and starts talking to me.

505
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,890
Me.

506
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:43,260
Oh,sorry to interrupt,Miss, but I'd ask
you not to continue questioning my son

507
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:47,380
until he has a chance to confer
with his attorney here,Mr. Beverly.

508
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,170
Mr. Beverly, my son,Charles.

509
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,330
Charles.

510
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,250
Have you out of here before you know it.

511
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,070
I see Mom finally came through,huh?

512
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,290
This is Allison Dubois.

513
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,180
She's with the district
attorney's office.

514
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:04,270
Allison,my dad and,apparently,
my new attorney.

515
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,940
- Nice to meet you,Mr. Winters.
- Ms. Dubois.

516
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,520
We're actually finished here.

517
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,550
If you gentlemen would like
to use this room to chat.

518
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,590
Great. Thank you.

519
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,220
She was an odd girl, you know.

520
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,850
I wouldn't put it past her...

521
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,920
take her own life,
leave a note like that.

522
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,340
- Dad!
- I'm just saying.

523
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,060
You ever meet her?

524
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,380
Yes. Briefly.

525
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:37,050
Well,then you know. She was an odd girl.

526
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,590
What's the motive?

527
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,190
You know, they didn't own much of anything
other than the enormous debt on that house.

528
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,990
They didn't have much life insurance.

529
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,470
Uh,maybe,uh, he hated her?

530
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,780
No,I don't get that.

531
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,850
I,I never got that from him.

532
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,290
I think he honestly loved her.

533
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:58,940
And besides,you have to hate
somebody a lot to risk life in prison.

534
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,240
All right,you win. He loved her.

535
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,850
What's your theory?

536
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,520
I don't have a theory.

537
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,270
She simply committed suicide.

538
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:11,590
She took a bunch of sleeping pills and let
herself to drown to death in the bathtub.

539
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,000
And then wrote a letter
implicating her husband?

540
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,870
Why? Did she hate him?

541
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,480
No. I didn't get that either.

542
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,770
None of it makes any sense...

543
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,770
least of all, the dreams
that I keep having.

544
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,740
Hey,you know what you need to do?

545
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,360
You need to put it out of your mind
and you need to come help me pack.

546
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,900
All right. Well,you met
this Terry Cavanaugh,right?

547
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,550
Is he a suit guy?

548
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,840
Yeah,he seems like a suit guy.

549
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:37,160
And you don't know what
this meeting is about?

550
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,060
I don't know. They just called.

551
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:42,180
They said Terry Cavanaugh wanted to meet
with me tomorrow, and was I available?

552
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,470
Um,they said there was going to be a
first-class ticket waiting for me at the airport

553
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,360
and a car to pick me
up on the other end.

554
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,090
You think it has something
to do with Meghan?

555
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,900
I mean,isn't he the guy that she said was
going to invest all that money in your idea?

556
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,700
Yeah,he certainly is.

557
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,320
I don't know.Maybe he
needs a good engineer

558
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,010
and heard from Meghan I'm out of work.

559
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,210
Not now. Go away!

560
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,370
- Daddy!Daddy,help me!Please,Daddy!
- Kelly!here!

561
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,110
Kelly!

562
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,810
Madeleine, what the
hell is going on here?

563
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,250
Mr. Winters.

564
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,670
I'm District Attorney Devalos.

565
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,390
You've already met Detective
Scanlon, Mrs. Dubois.

566
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,520
Appreciate you rushing down
here. Please,have a seat.

567
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,270
Not at all. I'm glad I could do it.

568
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,350
When you said that there might be some kind
of a deal you could offer my son Charles...

569
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,860
The important thing is, we're starting
to buy into your theory,Mr. Winters:

570
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:54,680
that she did it to herself, that she
left that letter to implicate Charles.

571
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,110
Like I said...

572
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,720
she was an odd girl.

573
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:03,930
The key thing is,some new facts have come to
light that from our standpoint change everything.

574
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,930
Terrific. What have you found out?

575
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,370
SCANLON: First and foremost,
your daughter's maiden name.

576
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,020
It was actually McKenzie
before she changed it.

577
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,730
Or how about the fact that you are listed
as the father on her birth certificate?

578
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,430
Mr. Winters...

579
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,910
your son's wife was
your daughter,wasn't she?

580
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:34,340
Ever since Kelly's death, we've been
struggling to find enough physical evidence

581
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:40,240
to implicate your son or find a reason why his
wife would hate him enough to leave that letter.

582
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,160
And frankly,we haven't
come up with either.

583
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,210
And now I know why.

584
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,300
She didn't really hate him.

585
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:50,030
Of course,she didn't
really love him either.

586
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,120
She just knew who he was, your son,

587
00:34:55,130 --> 00:35:00,070
a means to an end...and
that end was you.

588
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:06,130
You have to understand, when
he first brought her home,

589
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,240
I didn't recognize her.

590
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,830
I hadn't seen Kelly...

591
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,950
my Kelly,in 20 years.

592
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,080
But then,when they bought
the house on Fremont,

593
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,230
and Charles told me that she was
hearing a baby crying at night,I...

594
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,600
I knew it must be her.

595
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:28,640
She really was her mother's daughter.

596
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:32,030
And you think that's why
Madeleine drowned your son?

597
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,440
To punish you?

598
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,820
Yep.

599
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,750
Madeleine was my mistress.

600
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,320
I was already married to
Charles' mother when I met her.

601
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:47,970
I told her right up front that
I would never leave my family.

602
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,680
I loved my wife.

603
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,200
And when she began to suspect I was being
unfaithful, she gave me an ultimatum.

604
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,200
So I gave one to Madeleine
and I told her it was over.

605
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,000
That night I went to the house.

606
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:07,600
I went there to say good-bye to the children
and to give Madeleine some money to start over.

607
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:14,460
But when I got there, she
had already drowned Johnny.

608
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,250
Tried to kill Kelly.

609
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,970
So I told Madeleine to call the police
and tell them there had been an accident.

610
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:26,550
By that time,whatever fever
had possessed her was gone.

611
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,590
She didn't want to go to prison.

612
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:31,560
She didn't want to hurt Kelly.

613
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,610
And she didn't want anyone
to know what she had done.

614
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:38,630
For once,we both wanted the same thing.

615
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,990
I know I should have taken
Kelly with me that night.

616
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,320
I know that.

617
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:49,620
But that would have been the end
of my life with Charles' mother.

618
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,020
The end of everything.

619
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,170
Mr. Winters,I'm going to see
to it that Charles is released.

620
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,400
I'm not certain that I can actually
charge you with a crime at this point,

621
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:04,640
but you can be damn
sure I'm going to try.

622
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,620
In the meantime, you're going to need to
tell your wife and your son the whole truth...

623
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:14,520
and I suspect that's as fitting a way
as any for your punishment to begin.

624
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,470
Thank you.

625
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,710
Thank you for coming, Mr. Dubois.

626
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,270
Very anxious to meet you again.

627
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,560
Very anxious to look you in the eye.

628
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,210
Sit down.

629
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,790
You know, I bought your
company, bought your invention.

630
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,590
I suspected you might have.

631
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,900
I wanted to buy it the
day I met you in Phoenix.

632
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,680
She wanted four million. I paid her two.

633
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,280
How much did you end up with?

634
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,150
A lot less than that.

635
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,910
You hate her?

636
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,890
I'm not inviting her
over for Thanksgiving.

637
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:09,590
She's a bottom-feeder, a
matchmaker, an agent,a broker.

638
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,710
Got 'em in every business.

639
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,640
The only thing they're
good at is smelling money.

640
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:20,930
The day you met her, the day you pitched your
idea to that firm she worked for, she called me.

641
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,910
Said "I think I might have
something you'd be interested in."

642
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,370
She was right.

643
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,200
Well,good for her.

644
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:32,390
She knew I'd be interested because I've spent
the last seven years developing a technology

645
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,340
that's surprisingly similar.

646
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:38,670
She knew I'd be interested because I'd want
to make sure yours never made it to market.

647
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,790
She knew I'd pay to kill it.

648
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,640
Sounds like the two of you
were meant for each other.

649
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:50,020
Well,two days ago,I finally
looked at what I bought.

650
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,980
Went through the drawings,
went through the specs.

651
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,290
Mr. Dubois, I like
yours better than mine.

652
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,550
Well,thank you... I guess.

653
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,370
How'd you like to
finish what you started?

654
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,850
You got a couple minutes?

655
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,970
Maybe. I got to pick Joe up at
the airport in about an hour.

656
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,950
This won't take that.

657
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:28,260
Mr. Van Dyke.

658
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,050
Just,uh,dropped by to say
good-bye to some folks. And I'm...

659
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,680
grateful to have that
opportunity with you.

660
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,440
I'm so sorry to hear about everything.

661
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:45,480
I know I haven't been your greatest
supporter or your greatest ally around here,

662
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:50,470
and,uh,I have no right
to ask for favors.

663
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:57,460
And as you well know, I'm not even sure I
believe in what it is you claim you're able to do.

664
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,980
What is it that you need,sir?

665
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,280
My wife...

666
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,120
my children...

667
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,640
as you might imagine, they're
having a difficult time with this.

668
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:16,370
After I'm gone...

669
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,800
When I'm no longer here...

670
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,490
I don't know how it works.

671
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,990
I don't know what to tell you to do.

672
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:31,520
But if what you want
is for me to see you...

673
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,720
to tell your wife and
children that you're fine...

674
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,970
I promise you...

675
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,890
I will be on the lookout.

676
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:47,360
You really can read minds,can't you?

677
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,720
Thank you.

678
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,960
Isn't this fun?

679
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:02,350
And the later it gets, the funner it is.

680
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,730
They're here! They're here!

681
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:08,400
That's it! It's 9:30! You
guys are supposed to be in bed!

682
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:23,410
I keep thinking it's this giant
cosmic joke, that I'm going to wake up,

683
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,570
the last eight hours
never happened at all.

684
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,810
And you're sure we don't have to move?

685
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,060
He said do it in Phoenix.

686
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,260
Do it where you live.

687
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,460
Find some space, hire some
people, make me some money.

688
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,110
Hey,should we tell the kids?
Should we wake the kids?

689
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,270
let's not.

690
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,810
Hey,Ariel,what's going on?

691
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,810
I didn't hear them come in.

692
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,210
How are we supposed to
get our good-night kisses?

693
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,110
Yeah.

694
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,070
I don't know what to tell you guys.

695
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,620
They're still in the garage.

696
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,790
Well,what do you think
they're doing out there?

697
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,360
- Don't they know they have kids?
- Yeah?

698
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,160
- That's it. I'm quitting this family.
- Yeah!
