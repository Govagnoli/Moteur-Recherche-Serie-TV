00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,600
Previously on Medium:

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,210
You totally saved me.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,530
It's my mom.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,700
Pain in the ass. Thank you so...

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,600
Suzie!

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,310
According to this,Cynthia Keener had a
daughter named Suzie who went missing in 1998.

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,050
Don't scream. Don't scream,okay?

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,640
Don't scream. He'll hear you,okay?

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,430
I know where he took her,where
he kept her and the others.

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,210
The others?

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,300
There was at least one other.

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,580
Her name was Johanna.

13
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,180
Oh,my God.

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,850
Marion Wheeler?

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,720
Are you the owner of this store?

16
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,180
Maybe.

17
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,550
Johanna?

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,160
Her disappearance in 1998?

19
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,640
My daughter isn't missing.
She's never been missing.

20
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,150
It means you're wrong.

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,560
It means I'm actually...

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,310
I'm actually angry that that
woman's daughter isn't dead

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,970
because she could have been there
for daughter in her final moments,

24
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,750
if in fact,if she was
ever even in that basement.

25
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,710
What does that mean?

26
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,060
It means you're fired.

27
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,670
Slow down. Are you
telling me you think you...

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,450
you actually invented something?

29
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,970
Here's the thingit isn't just a toy.

30
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,690
I actually think that it might
have real world applications.

31
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,320
I figure all that's going
to cost about $30,000.

32
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,900
Joe,come on.

33
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,250
$30,000? We don't even have $3,000.

34
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,580
The girl's college money.

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,640
There's almost $32,000
just sitting there.

36
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,340
You know I can't do this.

37
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,810
God,isn't life funny?

38
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,090
I mean,this whole marriage has
always been about me believing in you.

39
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,660
Now the one time,the one time,the
shoe ends up on the other foot...

40
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,240
This is not the same thing.

41
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,690
It's exactly the same thing,exactly.

42
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,220
Where are you going?

43
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,000
What does it matter?

44
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,910
Joe...

45
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,570
Stop it,please!

46
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,980
Oh,God... oh,God.Oh,God.

47
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,070
I don't understand why...

51
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,930
You watching this,or can
I change it to the news?

52
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,240
No,no,it's your bar. Your TV.

53
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,500
Change it to whatever you like.

54
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,610
You and the missus had a blowup,huh?

55
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,720
Yeah. How did you know?

56
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,670
You've been fiddling with that wedding band for
the last hour and every time the phone rings,

57
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,420
you forward it to voicemail.

58
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,020
Want some advice?

59
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,890
Problems at home never
get solved at a bar.

60
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,530
Next time that thing rings,answer it.

61
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,450
Might be an emergency.

62
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,440
Maybe she needs your help.

63
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,050
Reporting live from just
outside Casa Valley Hospital

64
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,270
where the two young women managed to escape
from their captor early this morning...

65
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,990
Actually,it looks like
she's doing just fine.

66
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,170
Looks like she's right
where she wants to be.

67
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,190
Ms. Keener.

68
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,670
One of your colleagues from
Ameritips is asking for you.

69
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,020
She's in the waiting area.

70
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,950
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,260
I know I'm not supposed to be here.

72
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,460
I'm supposed to be a secret.

73
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,260
I have to talk to you about something.

74
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:22,670
Everything I've been seeing in my dreams
the last few nights,everything about Suzie--

75
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,520
it happened.

76
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,080
It did not happen.

77
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,960
Not to my daughter,not nine years ago.

78
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,460
We know that now.

79
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,670
What you saw was happening
to Melanie Linder.

80
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,370
You got the faces confused.

81
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,280
- You put Suzie's face where Melanie's was,and...
- No.

82
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,030
I think I got the faces right:

83
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,320
Suzie's,Johanna
Wheeler's,the kidnapper's.

84
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,930
That makes no sense.

85
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,340
Johanna Wheeler was just freed.

86
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,280
Obviously,she wasn't locked up in a
basement with my daughter nine years ago.

87
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,740
I think she was.

88
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,740
What are you saying?

89
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,360
She was in on it.

90
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,640
She and her boyfriend.

91
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,560
He's not the man who took Suzie,but I believe
he and Johanna had the same arrangement.

92
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,400
What do you mean?

93
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,670
They would
target a girl--

94
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,830
someone they both wanted.

95
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,330
And the boyfriend would kidnap her and
throw her in the basement with Johanna

96
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,300
who would pretend to be a fellow victim.

97
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,160
Why would she do that?

98
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,190
Because she's a sociopath.

99
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,620
Because she thinks it's fun.

100
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,130
Because it's all a big game to her.

101
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,530
She likes
befriending them--

102
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:36,210
getting them to open up,seducing them,keeping
them close to her,and then watching...

103
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,140
their surprise when she betrays them.

104
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,700
Laughing while they're suffering.

105
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,630
Well,I saw Johanna when
they brought her in.

106
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,020
She didn't look like she
was playing a game to me.

107
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,860
She's acting.

108
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,700
For you,for the police,for the media.

109
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,140
She has to.

110
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:00,740
The last thing she imagined was that Melanie
Linder would get that gun away from her boyfriend

111
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,530
and kill him with it,before
they could kill her.

112
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,010
Well,that's a very
interesting theory,Allison.

113
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:13,640
The only problem is,Melanie Linder wasn't the
one who wrestled the gun away from the kidnapper.

114
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,990
Melanie Linder wasn't
the one who shot him.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,670
It was Johanna Wheeler.

116
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,240
I'm home.

117
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,840
You smell like beer.

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,650
I don't know what to tell you.

119
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,930
It's not our money to use.

120
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,850
It's the girls' money.

121
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,430
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,950
Do you want to pick up the
girls or you want me to do it?

123
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,810
You're right. You probably
shouldn't be driving.

124
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,270
Please...

125
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,580
please don't.

126
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,110
Please.

127
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,860
Don't.

128
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,420
If you have to take one of us...

129
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,900
take me.

130
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,540
If you take her,she'll just keep crying.

131
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,570
Me...

132
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,070
I can make you believe I like it.

133
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,570
Not yet.

134
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,670
I have to check my messages.

135
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,230
Hey,sweetie,it's Mom.

136
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,110
Listen,Johanna,I'm sorry to bother you with
this,but the strangest thing just happened.

137
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,950
These two women came to
visit me here at the store.

138
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,900
One of them was a private investigator

139
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,710
and they both seemed to be under
the impression that something...

140
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,590
well,that something terrible
happened to you nine years ago.

141
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,510
I mean,obviously they have
the wrong Johanna Wheeler,

142
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:00,880
but I don't know,I just thought
you should know just in case.

143
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,380
Next message...

144
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,140
Hello,Ms. Wheeler.

145
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,800
My name is Cynthia Keener and I'm
an investigator with Ameritips.

146
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,420
I'm calling because it recently
came to my attention that

147
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:18,710
you may have some information regarding a
missing persons case involving a Suzanne Keener.

148
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,260
If you'd call me at your earliest
convenience I'd appreciate it.

149
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,940
I can be reached at...

150
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,120
**********

151
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,890
Daddy?

152
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,550
Daddy,you up?

153
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,540
Bridge... You all right?

154
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,140
Everything all right?

155
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,840
Why are you sleeping in here?

156
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,260
I don't know. It's fun.

157
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,860
Sweetie,what is it?

158
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,540
I think you need to
go to the bank,Daddy.

159
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,370
What are you talking about?

160
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,920
Well,you need money,right?

161
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,430
I heard you and Mommy talking about it.

162
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,950
Yeah,but,Bridge,no one at the bank
is just going to give us money.

163
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,200
But they are.

164
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,960
I had a dream about it.

165
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,480
There's this white-haired man working
there,and he wants to give you a bunch of money.

166
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,300
A white-haired man?

167
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,490
Bridge,this
white-haired man--

168
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,480
he wouldn't be Santa by any chance?

169
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,890
Dad,come on.

170
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,250
I'm nine. Trust me.

171
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,570
Allison,what are you doing here?

172
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,820
Do you have any idea what time it is?

173
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,790
Did you leave a message for Johanna Wheeler
after we met her mother the other day?

174
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,360
Well,yes,I did.

175
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,520
I wanted to make absolutely
sure she didn't know my daughter.

176
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,430
Why?

177
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,540
Her mother left her a
message too,at we were asking

178
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,460
Yesterday you asked me if Johanna
and David Draper were partners,

179
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,710
why would she kill him before
they finished their little game.

180
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,940
Well,now I think I know the answer.

181
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,180
It was us,Cynthia.

182
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,790
We're the reason that she killed him.

183
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,400
We spooked her.

184
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:37,780
This is Peter Connolly,the man that
I saw torturing Suzie in my dreams.

185
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,990
The man I believe was working
with Johanna Wheeler in 1998.

186
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,670
You think that I'm wrong?

187
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,810
Let's talk to Johanna Wheeler.

188
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,020
Let's talk to Peter Connolly.

189
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,390
Can I help you,sir?

190
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,730
Uh,I don't know,maybe.

191
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:11,070
Um,a friend of mine recommended that I come
and speak to a colleague of yours about a loan,

192
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,040
but I'm having a hard
time remembering his name.

193
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,800
All I know for sure is
that he has white hair.

194
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,450
Oh,you mean Walter.

195
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,450
Walter,yes. Good ol' Walter.

196
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,860
Miss Wheeler?

197
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,940
Do you have a moment?

198
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,110
If you're reporters,the press
conference is downstairs.

199
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,810
I'm not giving any interviews.

200
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,250
Actually,I'm an
investigator with Ameritips.

201
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,070
My name is Cynthia Keener.

202
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,940
You,uh,left a message on my cell,right?

203
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,670
Something about a missing persons case?

204
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,140
That's right.

205
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,200
I listened to it this morning when the
police returned my personal effects,

206
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,130
but I didn't understand it.

207
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,450
No one I know has ever gone missing;

208
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,360
no family,no friends,no
one except myself,really.

209
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,350
I don't see how I could be of any help.

210
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,350
Well,we were wondering if maybe you'd
be willing to look at a few photographs,

211
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,290
tell us if you recognize
any of the people in there.

212
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,240
Of course,if you think it would help.

213
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,360
I'm sorry. I don't know her.

214
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,380
How about this man?

215
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,850
Maybe you'd like to look
again just to make sure.

216
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,030
I've never seen this
man before in my life.

217
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:57,620
Well,obviously,the anonymous
tip my office received was bogus.

218
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,430
It happens sometimes.

219
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,290
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

220
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,120
Are you saying that someone told you I had
information about a missing persons case?

221
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:17,050
Well,earlier this week,my
office received a tip that

222
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:23,160
this man Peter Connolly
abducted two young women in 1998.

223
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:29,210
He kept them in a basement,raped them
repeatedly,tortured them,then discarded them.

224
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,610
According to the
person who contacted me,

225
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,640
one of these young women
was my daughter Suzie.

226
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,520
The other one was you.

227
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,740
This some sort of joke?

228
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,850
I was kidnapped this week.

229
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,990
I was raped this week.

230
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,870
If the same thing had
happened to me nine years ago,

231
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,040
don't you think I would have
mentioned it to the police?

232
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:04,430
If this is a joke,it's being
had at both of our expenses.

233
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,410
Obviously,I love my daughter
very much,Miss Wheeler,

234
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,520
and I would do anything to
find out what happened to her,

235
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:17,000
even risk upsetting you at what
is clearly a very difficult time.

236
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,280
Please forgive me.

237
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:27,090
Have you talked to him yet,this,uh,this
Connolly person,the one in the photograph?

238
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,480
No,not yet. He's next on our list.Why?

239
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,160
According to the
person who contacted me,

240
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:39,610
this man Connolly had a lot in common with
the man who kidnapped you and Melanie Linder.

241
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,320
You know,Ms. Dubois and
I keep asking ourselves,

242
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,950
"Was there any connection
between these two men?

243
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,910
"Did they know each other?

244
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,320
"Was there communication
between them at some point?

245
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,220
"Did they frequent the same nightclubs?

246
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,260
Perhaps they trolled
the same chatrooms."

247
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,220
Or who knows?

248
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,420
Maybe they dated the same woman.

249
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,200
I suppose anything is possible.

250
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,360
Very sorry I couldn't be
of more help,Ms. Keener.

251
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,750
Maybe you'll have more luck
with this Connolly fellow.

252
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,970
Who knows? Maybe he'll even
give you a full confession.

253
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:25,950
I mean,I get the feeling
that without one,you...

254
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,870
you really don't have much
of a case at all,do you?

255
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,230
Thank you for your time,Miss Wheeler.

256
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,380
We'll be in touch.

257
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,270
Absolutely.

258
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,680
Definitely.

259
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,500
I'll see you then.

260
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,940
Don't do this. Don't go.

261
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,030
Ask me about my day.

262
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,190
Ask me who I was on the phone with.

263
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,550
All right. Who were
you on the phone with?

264
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,010
Cynthia Keener.

265
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,600
She finally managed to track down a
current address for Peter Connolly.

266
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,720
We plan on paying him a visit tomorrow.

267
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,040
See if we have better luck rattling
his cage than we did Johanna Wheeler's.

268
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,750
Are you telling me that you're actually
gonna try and provoke a man who,

269
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,700
according to your dreams,repeatedly raped
and then murdered an 18-year-old girl?

270
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,440
That's sort of the only thing we can do.

271
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,250
We don't have any evidence
to bring the police.

272
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,540
Tell me about your day.

273
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,340
You have a meeting or something?

274
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,630
Yeah,you could say that.

275
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,780
With who?

276
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,670
With Walter,the wondrous
white-haired banker.

277
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,930
The man from Bridgette's dream?

278
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,290
He didn't give you the money,did he?

279
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,840
Well,he wanted to.

280
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,950
But...

281
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,760
But we already have two
mortgages on the house,

282
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:06,250
and since what I really have
is an invention or actually,

283
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,630
just an idea for an
invention,technically,

284
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't really qualify
for a small business loan.

285
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,030
Don't do that.

286
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,300
Don't go sleep out there.

287
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,010
I know you're mad at me.

288
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,670
Can't you just be mad at me in here?

289
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,010
I need that money,Allison.

290
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,080
I need you to sign those papers.

291
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,960
****

292
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,420
It's so peaceful here.

293
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,680
It's so quiet.

294
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:55,650
I could stay here forever and
ever right here on this spot.

295
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,470
Mom

296
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,850
don't say it.

297
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,190
I know what you're gonna say.

298
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,140
I don't want you to say it.

299
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,270
I mean it,Suzie. I'm your mother.

300
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,960
You have to do what I tell you to do.

301
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,350
I'm sorry,Mom. It's time.

302
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,600
I have go back now.

303
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,610
You know how much I love you,don't you?

304
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:06,320
You only tell me every
freakin' time I see you.

305
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,670
Sweetie,come on.

306
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,310
Your sister's got a test first period.

307
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,720
You can draw after school.

308
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:04,150
Dad,the man you spoke to at
the bank,did he look like this?

309
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,790
Bridge,nobody looks like this.

310
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,010
Dad,look closer.

311
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,150
Is that a mustache?

312
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,100
Yeah,didn't I tell
you about the mustache?

313
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,200
You spoke to the
wrong white-haired man.

314
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,370
Bridge,there was only
one white-haired man.

315
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,350
No,but that can't be right!

316
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,640
There has to be two!

317
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,360
No,Bridge,come on,sweetie.

318
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,610
It was a dream,all right? Just a dream.

319
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,500
Now can we please just let it go?

320
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,150
No,I'm sorry.

321
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,770
I've never seen her before.

322
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,760
She's been in the news lately,right?

323
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,840
She and another young woman were kidnapped
and held in a basement for a week.

324
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,240
Sound familiar?

325
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,370
You claim never to have seen this
young woman before in your life,

326
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,120
and yet,my office was contacted
by an individual who says that

327
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,050
you and a partner abducted,raped
and murdered her in 1998.

328
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:07,150
And with each passing day,my team and I
draw ever closer to you and your partner.

329
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,510
Now,it's gonna take a
little while,but that's okay.

330
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,620
We want to build the
strongest case possible.

331
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,330
We want to be thorough.

332
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,390
That's the only way you can
guarantee the death penalty,really.

333
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,060
But then again,you might
come to your senses.

334
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:25,480
One of you might confess or cut a deal
with the district attorney's office.

335
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,640
That would be the
smarter move,of course.

336
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,930
Piece-of-crap
rowboat.

337
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,020
These shoes are ruined.

338
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,190
This was wrong.

339
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,380
This was a mistake.

340
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,940
What are you talking about?

341
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,240
Never should've let
you talk me into this.

342
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,940
Hey,baby,hey. Relax.It's over now.

343
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,330
What if somebody finds her?

344
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,940
What if they figure out what we did?

345
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,180
No one is gonna find her.

346
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,290
I just made sure of that.

347
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,360
Honestly.

348
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,840
You're a big,blubbering
mess now,but,mark my words,

349
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,110
in a week,you're gonna want another one.

350
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,080
No. Johanna,no.

351
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,390
This was it.

352
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,960
Never again.

353
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,600
We know that she was the
driving force,Mr. Connolly.

354
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,290
We know that she wanted
it more than you did.

355
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,760
It's important that you felt
remorse,that you stopped.

356
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:41,290
That's gonna mean something to the jury.

357
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,300
She's the one we really
want,Mr. Connolly.

358
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:47,870
She's the one who's still doing it.

359
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,660
We can go on accusing Johanna Wheeler and
Peter Connolly till we're blue in the face,

360
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,610
but unless we have any evidence...

361
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,810
I'm sorry I don't have more for you.

362
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,570
Oh,there's no need to apologize.

363
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,920
You've done more for me in the past week

364
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:14,760
than the entire Phoenix Police Department
has done in the last nine years.

365
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,750
Cynthia,I need you to go down that road.

366
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,890
What? Why?

367
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:36,880
This is the place I saw in my dreams.
You and Suzie's ghost came here to talk.

368
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,820
I've never been here before in my life.

369
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,270
Something I saw at the house.

370
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,370
Piece-of-crap
rowboat.

371
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,370
These shoes are ruined.

372
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,480
The night that Peter and
Johanna disposed of Suzie's body,

373
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,500
they were both dripping wet.

374
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,960
Johanna said something about a rowboat.

375
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,910
I'm praying it's someone else.

376
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,860
Don't know that you should have
hung around after you called,Allison.

377
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,240
People are starting to ask questions
I don't have good answers to.

378
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,490
Well,how long till the
coroner can give us an ID?

379
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,140
Remains have been down
there a good,long time.

380
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,940
All he can tell at this
point is that they're female.

381
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,540
That,and there are three metal pins.

382
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:39,360
In her left femur?

383
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,630
Suzie had a skiing accident in 1989.

384
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,160
She broke her leg. It's her.

385
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,890
identified the body that was recovered from
the bottom of Tyler Lake earlier this afternoon,

386
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,460
as Suzanne Keener,

387
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:09,110
a 19-year-old woman who disappeared from the parking
lot of a Phoenix strip mall almost nine years ago.

388
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,850
Channel 9's Dawn Velasquez was able to
catch up with Suzanne's mother,Cynthia,

389
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,420
as she left the coroner's
office a short while ago.

390
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:21,460
I'm saddened to have the very long
search for my daughter end this way,

391
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:27,000
but I'm also very encouraged by the great deal of
physical evidence that was recovered with Suzie's body,

392
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,620
so for now,I'm...

393
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,760
I don't remember you saying
anything about physical evidence.

394
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:32,910
'Cause there wasn't any.

395
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,860
Just an old skeleton in a tarp.

396
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,010
She's bluffing?

397
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,180
She wanted to give the killers
something to think about.

398
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,590
See what shakes out.

399
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,160
Remind me to never play
poker with that woman.

400
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,940
I need you to promise me.

401
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,310
We're gonna pay this money back.

402
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,810
Before we pay down the house,before we buy
any cars,we are going to pay this money back.

403
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,660
We're not gonna need to.

404
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,690
I know that if I can just get this idea
in front of some venture capitalists...

405
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,670
Worst-case scenario.

406
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,640
Worst-case scenario. You have my word.

407
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,970
Fine.

408
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,560
Tomorrow morning.

409
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:16,320
Whatever you need,I'll sign it.

410
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,150
I suppose you expect me
to sleep with you now.

411
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,280
No,in fact,I've decided I'm
never sleeping with you again.

412
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,600
Well,hold on a second.

413
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,340
Allison?

414
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:44,310
but I'm also very encouraged by the great deal of
physical evidence that was recovered with Suzie's...

415
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,960
Hello?

416
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,640
Who did you tell about the girl,Peter?

417
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,560
What? Who is this?

418
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,180
Who do you think it is?

419
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:56,200
Her mother paid me a visit today.

420
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,390
She asked me a bunch of questions,but
I didn't tell her anything.

421
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,320
She said her office received
an anonymous tip about me.

422
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,510
Yeah. She said the same thing to me.

423
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:09,630
The funny thing is,I never told
a soul about our darling Suzie.

424
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,230
You think that I did?

425
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,800
I don't know.

426
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:16,510
I mean,between the two of us,you
always did have the more,uh...

427
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,170
delicate constitution.

428
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,850
Well,I-I have wanted to tell.

429
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,830
I've wanted to get it off
my chest for a long time.

430
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,290
I've just never been,um,strong enough.

431
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,870
I believe you.

432
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,300
They said on the news they
found physical evidence.

433
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,520
What do you think they've got,Pete?

434
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,990
Your blood? Your semen?

435
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,320
That body's been at the bottom
of that lake for nine years.

436
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,320
There wouldn't be
anything left but bones.

437
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,450
You think they're bluffing?

438
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,600
Yeah,of course they're bluffing.

439
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:53,840
I know it's hard,baby,but you...

440
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,630
you've got to be strong for me,okay?

441
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,030
Just... just for a little while longer.

442
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,970
We keep our mouths shut,and
all of this goes away,I promise.

443
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,130
Tell me you can do it. Come on.

444
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,180
Tell me you can be strong.

445
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,960
Sorry.

446
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:18,770
Hello?

447
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,860
Peter Connolly just called me.

448
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,280
He wants to talk about a deal.

449
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,100
You're kidding me?

450
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,630
No,he keep everything very
hypothetical at this point.

451
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,750
"If I was a party to this.
If I was a party to that."

452
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,990
But I could hear it in his voice.

453
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,380
He's starting to crack.

454
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,270
Cynthia,that's wonderful.

455
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,810
I know,I'm leaving for
his house right now.

456
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,380
I thought you might want to meet me.

457
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,130
Me?

458
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,970
Well,yeah,you started
this thing,Allison.

459
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,030
It seems only fair
you're there to finish it.

460
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:50,860
Oh,well,I should be an hour or two,tops.

461
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,530
You're sure you're okay with the girls?

462
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,880
Yeah,it's Saturday,babe.

463
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,540
What's there to do but watch
cartoons and eat cereal?

464
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,960
What? What's going on?

465
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:03,100
Well,it's Saturday. The bank
closes early on Saturdays.

466
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,580
I wanted to go by and sign those papers
for you and deposit this retainer check that

467
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,790
Cynthia gave me for this week.

468
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,310
Cover that check that we
sent to Dr. Bondi on Thursday.

469
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,750
Tu crippling debt es mi crippling debt.

470
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,330
I'll take it to the
bank when Ariel gets up.

471
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,770
You go.

472
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,100
Bring that nice lady some closure.

473
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,390
Everything's covered here.

474
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,600
We'll sign the papers on Monday.

475
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,900
Bye,stinkus.

476
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,040
Did I hear you say
you're going to the bank?

477
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:32,120
You're not fooling anyone,you know.

478
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,260
What do you mean?

479
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:37,210
I mean,I know you're only here 'cause
you want to look for the white-haired man.

480
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,700
I can help the next customer.

481
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,380
- I'd like to deposit that,please.
- Sure

482
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,710
Daddy! Daddy,come quick!

483
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,960
I found him! I found him!

484
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,100
Sorry. Excuse me a minute.Bridge...

485
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,590
Daddy!

486
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,410
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

487
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,260
Just a little fall. Oh,thank you.Thanks.

488
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,640
Ms. Keener. Mrs. Dubois.

489
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,570
You killed him,didn't you?

490
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,140
You knew he was going to speak with us.

491
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:03,100
You knew he was going to
give you up,so you shot him.

492
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:07,220
Ms. Keener,I don't know
what you're talking about.

493
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,520
Peter Connolly. He's dead.

494
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,190
You,uh...

495
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,160
you showed me his photograph,right?

496
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,890
We found him this
morning in his apartment.

497
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,490
The police believe it was a suicide.

498
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,300
Suicide?

499
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,210
Sounds like a guilty conscience to me.

500
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,030
Maybe you were right about him.

501
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,530
Maybe he did have something to
do with your daughter's murder.

502
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,840
Don't play innocent with
me,you little monster.

503
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,470
Ms. Keener...

504
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:40,360
I'm so sorry about what
happened to your daughter,

505
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:45,550
and I'm sure that it's the stress of
finding her body after all these years

506
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,730
that's making you act this way.

507
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,440
But I had nothing to do with her death.

508
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:55,510
I don't know how to
make that any clearer.

509
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,870
And I really think you should leave now
or I'll be forced to call the authorities.

510
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,970
If you think this is over,you're wrong.

511
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,940
I can go to Detective
Scanlon. I can tell him...

512
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,240
Tell him what? We have nothing,Allison.

513
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,800
Nothing but the knowledge she was there.

514
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,470
I'm so sorry.

515
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,550
You know,I used to think that
not knowing was the worst.

516
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,140
But this is worse.

517
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:33,570
I know exactly what happened.

518
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:38,110
I know exactly how my
daughter suffered and died.

519
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,540
And there's not the least amount
of justice I can bring to her.

520
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,030
What are you going to do now?

521
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,370
I'm going to bury my daughter.

522
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:02,150
I'm going to tell her how sorry I am
there was nothing I can do for her.

523
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,920
See you.

524
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,400
- Hello?
- Hello.

525
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,880
I need to tell you
something,but before I do,

526
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:15,750
I want to assure you that
everything's perfectly fine.

527
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,460
Okay.

528
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:22,750
I slipped and fell at the bank,and now I'm in
the emergency room at the Casa Valley Hospital.

529
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,520
Oh,my God,Joe,are you all right?

530
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:29,280
I've got the slightest little fracture
in my wrist,but other than that,I'm fine.

531
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,590
It hardly even hurts at all.

532
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,900
Besides,I've got Bridgette
right here to keep me company.

533
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,600
She's flirting shamelessly
with a handsome young intern.

534
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,500
You'd be very proud.

535
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,830
Are they putting a cast on you?

536
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,780
Are you going to be able
to drive yourself home?

537
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,270
Joe,are you there?

538
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,400
Sweetheart,I think I'm going
to have to call you back.

539
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:51,980
Mr. Dubois?

540
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,430
Reginald Smythe,Regional
Manager for Phoenix West.

541
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,650
I oversee all of our downtown branches.

542
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,280
I'd offer my hand,but...

543
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,650
15 grand!

544
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:05,370
15 freakin' grand just
for falling on my ass.

545
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,830
I think I've found my new calling.

546
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,850
I'm gonna be the guy who falls
down in banks for a living.

547
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,940
Someday I'll branch out-- maybe I'll fall
down in grocery stores,maybe even malls.

548
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,640
Too bad you didn't
crack your skull open.

549
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,210
Maybe you could've gotten the
whole 30 grand you were looking for.

550
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,560
I've been giving that some thought.

551
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,820
I'm starting to think that 30
may have been a little grand.

552
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,830
I think that I can do what
I need to with just this 15.

553
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,180
Husband to wife.

554
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,100
I'm trying to tell you we don't need
to touch the girls' college money.

555
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,860
I'm listening. I am.I hear.

556
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,100
That's... that is
great news.It's just...

557
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,580
Cynthia?

558
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,900
I feel like I wish I never started
dreaming about her daughter.

559
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,330
I wish I'd kept it to myself.

560
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,990
I feel like I've done
something incredibly cruel.

561
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,620
You've been doing this for a while,Al.

562
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,060
You know you don't get
the dreams that you get

563
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,670
because you're supposed
to keep them to yourself.

564
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,450
You get them 'cause you're
supposed to try to help people.

565
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,290
Well,how exactly did I help Cynthia?

566
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:06,510
You know,how is she better off today
knowing the things that I told her?

567
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:11,850
How's she going to sleep tonight knowing
who killed Suzie,but not be able to prove it?

568
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,800
Well,maybe Cynthia's not the person
you were supposed to help this time.

569
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,410
Now,because of your dreams,you and Cynthia
started asking questions about Johanna Wheeler.

570
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,950
Johanna,in turn,got nervous.

571
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,420
So nervous,in fact,that she killed her
new partner and let Melanie Linder go.

572
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,450
Now,let's say that you had
kept your dreams to yourself.

573
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:31,850
Let's say that you hadn't risked telling Cynthia some
pretty terrible things that had happened to her daughter.

574
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:36,160
Where exactly do you think
Melanie Linder would be tonight?

575
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,820
At home with her parents?

576
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:41,060
Or at the bottom of a
lake right next to Suzie?

577
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,920
You know,for a faithful manservant you have an
uncanny knack at putting things in perspective.

578
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,050
You should see me do windows.

579
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,890
I wish.In my dreams.

580
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,160
I would love to see that.

581
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,230
Hello?

582
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,350
Allison,it's Cynthia.

583
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,610
I was wondering if you
would meet me someplace.

584
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:34,030
When she was three years
old,I put Suzie in day care.

585
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,410
Her father had left us.

586
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,680
I needed to go back to work.

587
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,040
It wasn't the greatest place.

588
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,990
I couldn't afford much.

589
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,350
One morning,she came to me crying.

590
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,690
She said she didn't want to go.

591
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,400
The other kids were
mean to her,she said.

592
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:05,230
They hit her when the
teachers weren't looking.

593
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,400
And she was afraid.

594
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,900
She didn't know what to do.

595
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:17,710
Well,in those days,I had the
weight of the world on my shoulders.

596
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,530
I was just trying to get through
the week and pay the rent.

597
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:31,380
And I didn't have time for her
and her little girl problems.

598
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,760
And I got angry with her,and I said,

599
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:39,360
"Suzie...you've got to
stand up for yourself.

600
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:44,670
'Cause no one else is gonna
look after you in this life."

601
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,760
She was just three years old.

602
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:55,140
She was just a baby.

603
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:00,280
It was my job to look after her.

604
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,590
It was my job to stand up for her.

605
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:12,440
And now I finally have.

606
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,750
Cynthia...

607
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,800
whose house is this?

608
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,060
It's all right,Allison.

609
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,590
I've called the authorities.

610
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,380
They'll be here in a moment.

611
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,750
What can I do for you,Cynthia?

612
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,950
How can I help?

613
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:57,480
Take my hand.

614
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,210
Wait with me.
