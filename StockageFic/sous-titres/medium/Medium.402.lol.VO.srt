1
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,400
Ooh!

2
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,300
JOE:
Crisis averted.

3
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,300
All eyes under the age
of nine are closed.

4
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,900
And, miracle of miracles,

5
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,600
the children they
belong to are asleep.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,300
What about Ariel?

7
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,000
What about Ariel?
Let's leave Ariel alone.

8
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,300
She's 14. She's in her room
simultaneously doing homework,

9
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,400
listening to music,
texting her friends

10
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,400
and counting the hours
until she's 18.

11
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,900
Let's not unnecessarily
tax her concentration.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,700
How long was I asleep?

13
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,200
I was only gone ten minutes.
You fell asleep?

14
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,100
I had a dream. This girl,

15
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,400
she was in a car.
She hit a deer.

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,200
She was trapped inside.

17
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,600
Is there anyone to notify?

18
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Did you catch
the plate number?

19
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,000
You have any idea

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,900
where the accident
might have taken place?

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,300
No. Nothing.

22
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
I didn't even
see the girl's face.

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,400
Okay. Well,
I guess there's not much

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,200
to do about it right now, then.

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
(groaning)
A little help.

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,000
Anyway, you were
telling me about this woman.

27
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,000
From Ameritips.
Cynthia Keener.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,100
Why is she paying you?
Why isn't the company that
she works for paying you?

29
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,600
Because I don't work
for that company.

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,800
She doesn't want
the company knowing
anything about me.

31
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,600
 <i>You know, in a lot of ways,</i>
 <i>it's kind of like what I used</i>

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,800
to do for Devalos.

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,900
That was secret.
This is secret.

34
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,200
But why?

35
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,700
I think the job
is all she has.

36
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,100
I think she wants to impress
the people that she works for.

37
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,300
I guess she's hoping
I'll be able

38
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,500
to help her
with some of her cases.

39
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,200
Give her a leg up.

40
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,800
She'll get the glory,
I'll get the 800 bucks a week.

41
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,000
omm.m!

45
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,000
Allison, look.
Whatever you saw...

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,900
Our daughter, Joe.

47
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,900
The danger is not imminent,
if it's even real.

48
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,200
What does that mean?

49
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,200
Come on. The reality is,
Ariel does not dri.

50
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,100
Yet!

51
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,300
Exactly.

52
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,600
Whatever you saw,

53
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,300
it has nothing to do
with the here and now.

54
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,300
I mean, you know as well as I do

55
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,100
she's a good
two-and-a-half years away

56
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,600
from getting behind the wheel
of a car.

57
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,700
So?

58
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,200
So there's still time

59
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,900
to make sure
that it doesn't happen.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,400
In fact, we can guarantee it.

61
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,800
What do you mean, guarantee it?

62
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
What kind of car
did she have
the accident in?

63
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,400
I have no idea.

64
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,900
Okay. Well, hopefully,
sometime in the next

65
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,900
two-and-a-half years,
you'll have this dream again.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,200
And maybe then
you'll make it a point

67
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,300
to notice what make
and model the car is.

68
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,000
Then we'll make it a point
never to buy

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,100
that make
or model car.

70
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,700
Well, maybe it's not our car.

71
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,300
Maybe she borrows it
from a friend or a boyfriend.

72
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,400
Okay, fine. Fine. Look. When and
if you know what kind

73
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,200
of car it is, then
we'll both just go

74
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,100
to Ariel and
we'll tell her.

75
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,700
And she'll make it her business
never to get in one,

76
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,100
much less drive one.

77
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,200
See? It's a lock.
It's a guarantee.

78
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,500
Come on. Let's
get some rest.

79
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,000
CYNTHIA KEENER:
She's 16 years old.
Her name's Melanie Daniels.

80
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,200
Apparently, she's
a very good kid.

81
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,400
No history of
trouble or drugs.

82
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,300
She's a junior at
Hilldale High School
across town.

83
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,000
She's been missing
since yesterday morning.

84
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,100
She caught the bus
to go to school

85
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,000
but never showed
up at school.

86
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,700
This happened yesterday?

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,400
Why? Is something
the matter?

88
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,700
I guess I'm just surprised

89
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,000
that her parents called you
before the police.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,100
Oh, no, no.
They-They didn't call me.

91
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,300
I called them.

92
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,100
I went over to their home,
actually.

93
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,900
Just as soon as the missing
child report came through

94
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,000
on my e-mail, 
I drove over and talked

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,600
to the mother, and explained
that while

96
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,700
there were several hundred cases
the police were tracking,

97
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,800
for me, this would
be the only one.

98
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,800
That's quite a look
on your face, Mrs. Dubois.

99
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,900
I'm not an ambulance chaser,

100
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,900
but this <i>is</i> how I make my money,

101
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,100
and I need to strike
while the iron's hot.

102
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,600
Okay.

103
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,000
Um... forgive me.

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm not certain
how this works.

105
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,100
But I've read online
that people like you,

106
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,700
when they
touch something

107
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,100
that belongs to
a missing person or,

108
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,900
for instance,
a dead person,

109
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,800
um, sometimes you...
you might get vibes

110
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
or signals.

111
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,800
Yes? No?

112
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,400
Sometimes. It depends.

113
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,500
Here's the entire contents
of Melanie's locker.

114
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,900
Her mother gave me
permission to borrow it.

115
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,700
I was wondering

116
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,300
if you could do, uh...
whatever it is that you do,

117
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,500
and give me a call.

118
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,600
Hey, Ariel.

119
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,400
Are the Suns going to
make the playoffs this year?

120
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,400
I don't know.

121
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,800
I don't really follow sports.

122
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, maybe you
could ask your mom.

123
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,000
I mean, she knows
the future, right?

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Come on, man.
No, no. no.
Just ask her

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,300
if she could check
her crystal ball.

126
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,700
Leave her alone, Jeremy.

127
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,900
Just ask her.

128
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,900
Ariel!

129
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,000
Ariel, wait.

130
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,200
What do you want, Connor?

131
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,500
I don't know.

132
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,800
He's a jerk. And I'm a jerk
for hanging around him.

133
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,900
I'm really sorry.

134
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,200
Okay. I heard you.

135
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,600
So, are you going
to that KHBX thing?

136
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
What?

137
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,800
KHBX. The radio station.

138
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,400
They have that concert
at the Orpheum every year.

139
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,900
There's, like,
a dozen different groups.

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,700
It's on Saturday
during the day.

141
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,900
Did you maybe
want a ticket?

142
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,200
No. That's okay.

143
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,300
I actually don't have the money
for that right now.

144
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,000
No. No. I... I mean,

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,600
I would buy it for you.

146
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,100
We'd... we'd
go together.

147
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,900
I'm just warning you.
We're back from school,

148
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,300
and I need your help
with something.

149
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,600
What are you talking about?

150
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,900
Mom? Did Dad tell you?

151
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,700
The most amazing thing happened
to me at school today.

152
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,800
Well, tell me.

153
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,000
This really cute guy-- I think
he's in the 11th grade--

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,200
asked me to go to a concert with
him on Saturday

155
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,700
at the Orpheum downtown.

156
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,000
Are parents going
to this concert?

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,100
No.

158
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,800
And who is
this boy again?

159
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,100
Connor. He's really nice.

160
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,500
Yeah? But we don't
even know him.

161
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,300
And you want to go downtown
into the city?

162
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,800
It's during the day.
And how are you
going to get there?

163
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,300
I don't know. We haven't
figured that out yet.

164
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh, honey, I don't know.
I think that your mommy and I

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,200
are going to have
a problem with this.

166
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
I'm 14.

167
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,100
And he's 16.

168
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,800
So?

169
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,700
So we don't know him.

170
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,400
He's so nice. Honest.

171
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
And you know this how?

172
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,700
Because I know it!
And, besides, it's a concert!

173
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,300
They'll be tons of people.
Nothing is going to happen.

174
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,500
And you know this because
you've been to so many concerts?

175
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,500
You two are crazy!

176
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,900
Crazy? Really?

177
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,700
You know what
I've been doing all day?

178
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,500
I've been trying
to find a missing girl,

179
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,300
a couple of years older
than you.

180
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,500
Gone. Vanished into thin air.

181
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,800
Okay. So? I'm not her!

182
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,400
And how did it happen?
Was she going to a concert?

183
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,200
No. Actually,
she was going to school.

184
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,300
Okay. Fine.
I'll stop going to school.

185
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,600
Hey! You're not gonna get
your way by being a wise guy.

186
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,800
What difference does it make?

187
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,400
I'm not going
to get my way anyways.

188
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Ariel?

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Ariel.

190
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,200
You know, no one is saying
you can't ever go to a concert

191
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,800
without an adult.

192
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,800
No one is saying that
you can't ever go out with boys.

193
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,100
Just not this boy.

194
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Just not this Saturday.

195
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,500
Honey, I know
how you feel.

196
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,500
(phone rings in distance)
My mom wouldn't let me go

197
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,000
to a concert alone
until I was 16.

198
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,100
And you know what?

199
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,700
When I finally went,

200
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,300
I realized she was right.

201
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,300
Hey, it's Cynthia Keener.

202
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,100
She wanted to know if
you had anything for her.

203
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,600
She said you'd know
what that meant.
Yeah.

204
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,900
Tell her I'm still
working on it.

205
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,300
Tell her I need to
call her back, please.

206
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,700
Ariel...
(sniffles)

207
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,500
Fine.

208
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,900

Tell him you're here,
dufus!

226
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,500
Here.

Yup.

237
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,500

Uh, what do you mean?

238
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,200
Jordan Spence!
Come on, pretty
great, huh?

239
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,900
Well, I don't know. I mean,
what does he look like?

240
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,100
Okay, don't do that.

241
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,100
Don't take a poop all ovover my
good news just to be funny.

242
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,400
I'm sorry.
It's great.

243
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,900
It's better than great.

244
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,900
It happened just
the way I dreamed it.

245
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,800
Right in front
of my locker.

246
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,600
He was even wearing the shirt
I told you he'd be wearing.

247
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,300
I'm really happy for you, Mo...

248
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,600
Ally.

249
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,900
Did you pick up
your yearbook yet?

250
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,000
Did you see
the pictures of us?

251
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,400
There we are.

252
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,700
Al?

253
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,600
You okay?

254
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,100
What's going on?

255
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
It's Ariel.

256
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,100
It's that damn dream.

257
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,500
She can't reach the phone.

258
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,800
She's trapped in that car,
bleeding to death.

259
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,200
Okay...

260
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,300
No, I didn't see
the kind of car.

261
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,900
I didn't see anything.

262
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,600
Just our daughter suffering.

263
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,000
Wh-Wh-What are
you doing?

264
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh! Why do I keep
seeing that dream?

265
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,700
I'm not learning
anything from it.

266
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm not seeing anything
that I haven't seen already.

267
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,700
Okay, well,
call me crazy,

268
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,800
but, you know, she's not
speaking to you,you just had a
big fight with your daughter.

269
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,800
so maybe you're bringing that
anxiety back into bed with you.

270
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,800
You know what the irony is?
There is a girl out there

271
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,100
who really needs my help,
who really is in trouble,

272
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,200
and I have nothing for her. I
touch her things, I get nothing.

273
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,500
I touch her hairbrush,
I see her hair.

274
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,600
I touch her contact lens
case, I see her eyes.

275
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,700
I'm not even sure
any of it is real.

276
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,900
I so badly want
to see something.

277
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,100
Did you call
that Keener woman back?
No.

278
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,800
I'm gonna see her tomorrow.

279
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,500
I'm not looking forward to it.

280
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,300
You know, I...
have nothing for her.

281
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,900
CYNTHIA:
 <i>Well, I don't understand.</i>

282
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,000
I gave you all those things
that belong to her,

283
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,400
and you come up
with nothing?

284
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,500
It doesn't work that way;
I'm not a Geiger counter.

285
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
You can't just flip a switch
and turn it on.

286
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,200
Sometimes it just...
doesn't happen.

287
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,900
Still, you do
expect to get paid.

288
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,900
I don't work for charity.

289
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,600
Neither do you.

290
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
I mean, how did it work with
the District Attorney?

291
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,900
Surely there must have been
some level of reliability.

292
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,400
He wouldn't have kept you
around all that time
if there weren't.

293
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,800
It was completely different.

294
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,600
He didn't keep me
at home hiding.

295
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,100
I got to go to the crime scenes,

296
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,500
talk to the victims,
to their families.

297
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,400
Well, that would rather seem

298
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
to defeat the
purpose, wouldn't it?

299
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,200
I mean, this is supposed
to be about me, not you.

300
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,500
Who are you going to see?

301
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,000
You're going to see someone.

302
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,500
It has something to do
with this case.

303
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,600
Take me with you.

304
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,300
Are you playing me?

305
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,100
You've already paid me
for the week.

306
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,500
Why wouldn't you want
to get your money's worth?

307
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,000
All Right

308
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:49,800
???

309
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,500
The polygraph
seems to back that up.

310
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,300
The police seem to
think she was on her
way to his apartment.

311
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,700
What do you mean?

312
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,700
Oh, come on,
it's not <i>The DaVinci Code.</i>

313
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,500
She told everyone she was going
to school that day,

314
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,100
and, in fact,
she got off the bus,

315
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,200
made her way
towards his apartment.

316
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,700
At least that's
the theory du jour.

317
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,800
I've talked
to Melanie's parents.

318
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,600
I've asked them
to call the boy,

319
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,500
and find out if
I can interview him.

320
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,700
It's not a sure thing;
they haven't said yes.

321
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,600
After all, I haven't given them
a lot for their money so far.

322
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,900
It's going to happen.

323
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,400
You should take me with you.

324
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,300
You're completely playing me.

325
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,500
Fine, if it doesn't happen,
don't take me with you.

326
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,700
I'm just trying to earn my keep.

327
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,500
You said he was 18.

328
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,200
He's not going to know who I am.

329
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,700
You can introduce me
as whoever you want.

330
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,500
I'll think about it.

331
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,900
ARIEL:
 <i>See this picture?</i>

332
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,100
That's my mom.
And the girl next to her, that's

333
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,700
the girl that
I was in my dream.

334
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,500
Okay... but it's
still just a dream.

335
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,100
No, you don't understand.

336
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,400
I saw this picture
in this yearbook,

337
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,200
only that was me
where that girl is now,

338
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,900
in the exact same pose,
in exactly the same clothes.

339
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,200
Well, maybe you've seen
this book before.

340
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,900
Maybe you saw that picture,

341
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,500
and it just got
stuck in your head.

342
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,000
But I haven't; I've never
even heard my mom mention
a girl named Casey before.

343
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,200
Well... maybe you
should tell her.

344
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,800
Maybe you should tell
your mom about your dream,
about this yearbook.

345
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,700
No. No, no...
no way.

346
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,600
I'm so mad at her.

347
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,100
It's weird.

348
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,100
She was so cool in my dream.

349
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,400
So into the boy who
asked her to the dance.

350
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,200
She would be so disappointed

351
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,100
if she could see
how she turned out.

352
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,600
JOE:
 <i>Okay, here's my strategy.</i>

353
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,000
 <i>I'm paying the mortgage.</i>

354
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,600
Everything else I'm paying,

355
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,800
but I'm paying
with a credit card,
which I'm not paying.

356
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,500
You listening?

357
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,700
It's important
that you know these details

358
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,900
so that you can testify
in my defense

359
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,000
when they throw me
into debtor's prison.

360
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,800
Well, I look at these things,
I see nothing.

361
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,900
Well, I see things.

362
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,100
(sighing):
You know what?

363
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,900
We'll live without
the 800 bucks.

364
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,000
No, it's not that.
It's this girl.

365
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Well, I want to help her.

366
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,000
I want to help her parents.

367
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,900
I don't know
what to say, Al.

368
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,200
You know, if you were meant to
be of help, you'd be of help.

369
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,600
You keep telling me what
a jerk this Cynthia woman is.

370
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,500
Huh.
So maybe that's
the news here.

371
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,700
Maybe you're not supposed
to be working with her

372
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,500
on this or
any other case.
(sighs)

373
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,300
(sighs)
Al, it's 11:00.

374
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,000
Would you go in?
I'll be in in a second.

375
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,200
Ariel?

376
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,200
Hey, Ariel, I know
you're not asleep.

377
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,500
I know you're still
mad at me...

378
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,300
I don't know
what to tell you.

379
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,800
You're 14.

380
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,500
There'll be
other concerts.

381
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,300
There'll be other boys.

382
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,400
I just... I can't.

383
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,400
(singing along):
* There is freedom within *

384
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,500
* There is freedom
without *

385
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,400
* Try to catch the deluge
in a paper cup *

386
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,900
* There's a battle ahead *

387
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
* Many battles are lost *

388
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,100
Come on, Casey, sing along.

389
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,400
* ...the road while you're
traveling with me *

390
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,200
* Hey now, hey now *

391
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,300
WOMAN:
Allison!

392
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,200
(knock at door)
Okay, I'm shutting it off!

393
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,000
* Hey now *

394
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,800
I hate my mother.

395
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,100
Don't say that.

396
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,500
Why not? You say it all the time
about your parents.

397
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,900
I do?

398
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,600
I hate my parents and
I hate Jordan Spence.

399
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,500
How could he break up with me
just before summer vacation?

400
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,400
I don't know.

401
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,100
How could he break up with you
just before summer vacation?

402
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,400
You know what I was gonna get
him for his birthday?

403
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,400
Know what my big surprise
was gonna be?

404
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,100
Tickets to Crowded House,

405
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,600
his favorite band.

406
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,600
I've never
heard of them.

407
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,700
Really?

408
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,300
Jordan turned me on to them and
now they're like my favorite.

409
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,700
They're coming to
the Orpheum downtown.

410
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,200
I've been saving up money
for months.

411
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,900
You want to go anyway,
you and me?

412
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,400
What are you talking about?

413
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,600
I can't afford that.

414
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,700
I'll lend you the money,
I've got it right here.

415
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,100
Wait a minute, you're not
allowed to go to concerts.

416
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,700
Not until you're 16.

417
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,100
I know.
And neither are you.

418
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,000
What did your father say
the last time

419
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,800
they caught you sneaking
out of the house?

420
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,100
One more time and
they're sending you

421
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,800
to live with
your aunt in Germany.

422
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,200
Well, I'm not waiting a whole
other year to live my life.

423
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,500
I'm not.
The tickets go on sale tomorrow

424
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,600
and I know that they're gonna
sell out in no time.

425
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,500
We should definitely go.

426
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,900
But it's the Orpheum downtown.

427
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,000
And if our mothers
don't take us,

428
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,700
then how are we gonna get there?

429
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,500
This is downtown.

430
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,100
And here's the Orpheum
box office

431
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,600
right on Adams.

432
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,600
Okay.

433
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,900
Well, according to this,

434
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,900
the M-14 bus runs
right up and down Adams.

435
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,800
And what just happens to be at
the other end of Adams?

436
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,900
Why, the Moonlight Roller Rink,
of course.

437
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,100
Okay, but I still don't get it.

438
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,900
Sure you do. I get my mom to
drop us off in the morning,

439
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,100
we hop the bus downtown,
buy the tickets,

440
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,300
then hop on the bus back in time

441
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,400
for your mom to pick us up
at the roller rink.

442
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,500
Oh, my God, I think
that could work.

443
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,100
Of course it'll work.
Why wouldn't it work?

444
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,400
Oh, my God, that could work.

445
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,800
Oh, my God,????

446
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,400
Hey, you see that?
All bad things

447
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,100
don't necessarily
come to an end.

448
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,600
It's Cynthia Keener for you.

449
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,600
I'm taking the girls
to that matinee.

450
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,200
No candy.

451
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,300
No money.

452
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,500
Hello?

453
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,700
Any dreams?

454
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,000
Any breakthroughs?

455
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,700
Afraid not.

456
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,300
Melanie's parents
called the boyfriend.

457
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,000
He's agreed to meet me tonight.

458
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,200
You still interested
in being there?

459
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,000
You still interested
in having me?

460
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,900
Well, like you said,
I already paid you.

461
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,100
I might as well get
my money's worth.

462
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,000
I'll tell him to come around

463
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,200
to that little coffee shop
we meet at.

464
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,600
Can you be there at 7:00?

465
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,700
Oh, wait.

466
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,600
That's about the time

467
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm supposed to pick up
my daughter and her friend

468
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,500
from the roller rink.

469
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,900
And my husband just left.

470
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,800
You know what?

471
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,700
I'll just pick them up
a little early.

472
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,100
I can get them both back here
and still be able to get there.

473
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,800
ARIEL:
 <i>Thank you for doing this.</i>

474
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,000
That's the third time
you've thanked me.

475
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,600
Do you think I'm awful?

476
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,800
No. I think you've got a date
with Connor Widomski.

477
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,300
That says it all.

478
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,400
And besides,
your mom lied to you.

479
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,700
I wish you
could've seen her.

480
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,100
She was so cool.

481
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,400
Didn't care when her
parents told her no.

482
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,600
See? You're just doing
what she would've done.

483
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,100
You're just doing
what she <i>did.</i>

484
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,800
I know I'm a little early;
something came up.

485
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,900
Where's Ariel?

486
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,100
Ariel!

487
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,700
Ariel!

488
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
I just want
to let you know

489
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,200
I'm probably not going
to be able to make it.

490
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,500
Something came up that's
out of my control.

491
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,400
I am truly sorry.

492
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,700
CYNTHIA:
I don't understand.

493
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,900
Well, to be honest, I don't
really understand myself.

494
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,800
Cynthia, I don't know
what to say.

495
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,900
Well, neither do I.

496
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,800
JOE:
 <i>You lied to us?</i>

497
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,900
Yeah, well, she lied to me.

498
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,000
Excuse me-- lie to you?!

499
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,900
It wasn't me who got on a bus
and went downtown

500
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,400
when they were
told not to.

501
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Yeah, well,
as a matter of fact, it was.

502
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,400
What is she
talking about?

503
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,800
What <i>are</i> you talking about?

504
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,700
You.

505
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,800
You're such a liar.

506
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,300
No concerts until
you were 16?

507
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,700
Yes, I did not go to
a concert by myself

508
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,000
until I was 16--
what is your point?

509
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,600
There it is--
you're doing it again.

510
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,900
You're lying.

511
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,100
I happen to know that
you did go to a concert

512
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,300
with your best friend Casey,

513
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,400
and you did it when
you were in the ninth grade.

514
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,100
Even though
you weren't 16,

515
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,100
even though your parents
said you couldn't.

516
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,900
What?!

517
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,200
And you want to know
how you bought the tickets?

518
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,600
Your told your mom
you were going to go skate,

519
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,000
and you took a bus downtown.

520
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,100
What is going on here?

521
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,200
Is any of this true?
Who told you that?

522
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,300
Nobody told me anything.

523
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,600
I saw it.

524
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,300
I dreamt it.

525
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,000
You had a dream
about me and Casey?

526
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,100
Yeah. Only I was her.

527
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,700
I was Casey.

528
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,400
And you were so cool, Mom.

529
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,700
???

530
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,700
Is she still crying?

531
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,700
No. She's finally asleep.

532
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,600
And you can't sleep
and cry.

533
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,400
She said it had been
the best day of her life

534
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
and I made it the worst
day of her life.

535
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,000
Want to hear
the funny part?
Mm.

536
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,700
You know that concert
she's talking about--

537
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,300
I never even
made it there.

538
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,300
No?

539
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,600
We got a ride with
this senior who had a car.

540
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,900
He and his buddies were
drinking and smoking
the whole way.

541
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,200
We finally got there,
we were about to go
into the Orpheum,

542
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,900
and there's this cop
at the window.

543
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,900
And when he saw how young
Casey and I were,

544
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,900
he put us in his squad car
and drove us home.

545
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,900
So you really were 16
when you went to your
first concert.

546
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,000
Mm-hmm.

547
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,700
Oh.

548
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,700
So who is this friend--

549
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,300
the one that she's
dreaming about?

550
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,000
Casey Tunstell.

551
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,400
I haven't
spoken to her since, well...

552
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,100
pretty much since the night
of that concert, practically.

553
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,000
We stopped hanging out
after that.

554
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,700
I figure her parents must've
found out it was all my idea.

555
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,300
She just started avoiding me.

556
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,400
I guess they forbade her
to see me.

557
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,100
You know how that goes.

558
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,200
Last chance before
the main event.

559
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
We told you "no."
What's the problem?

560
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,300
Don't you girls know
how to have fun?

561
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,800
Look at her--
she's shaking.

562
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,000
I told you she just doesn't
want to get in trouble.

563
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,300
Her parents are
really strict.

564
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,500
Come on, we're here.
Let's just go inside.

565
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,200
OFFICER:
My goodness.

566
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,800
That's a fragrant aroma
coming from your vehicle.

567
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,300
Can I see your license,
please, sir?

568
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,800
Says here you're 17,
young man.

569
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,100
How about you two
in the back?

570
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,400
You sure look
young to me.

571
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,800
Either of you old enough
to have a license?

572
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,200
OFFICER:
Huh?

573
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,600
I didn't think so.

574
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,700
Your parents know that
you're hanging out with boys,

575
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,000
drinking and smoking?

576
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,500
We didn't drink
or smoke anything.

577
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,200
We just needed a ride.

578
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,700
You two planning on going
to the concert tonight?

579
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,000
Yes, we were, sir.

580
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,800
All right, I'm gonna
cut you some slack.

581
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,100
Get out.

582
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
What I want you to do

583
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,100
is go in there and sober up.
And I'm gonna be out here

584
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,900
waiting for you
when the concert's over.

585
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,500
And if either one
of you looks

586
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,100
the least bit squirrelly
to me,

587
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,300
not only will you not
be getting behind the wheel

588
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,000
of this car tonight,
but I will see to it

589
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 that neither one of you <i>ever</i>
gets behind the wheel

590
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,900
of a motor vehicle ever again.

591
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You read me?

592
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,200
Yeah. Thank you, Officer.

593
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,100
Okay.

594
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,900
Now, ladies, one more time,

595
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,800
do your parents know
that you're here,

596
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,900
either of you?

597
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,400
Yeah, they know.

598
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,400
Okay, well, give me their phone
numbers, each of you,

599
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,000
and I'll give 'em a call
and confirm that.

600
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,600
I thought so.

601
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,600
Why don't you hop out there?

602
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,900
Get in my car.
I'm taking you ladies home.

603
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,900
Are you gonna
be okay?

604
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,300
Are your parents
gonna be okay?

605
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,200
I remember how they got
that last time.

606
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,900
I'm so sorry, Case.

607
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,200
I can't believe this.

608
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Who knows?
Maybe it's just a dream.

609
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,500
Maybe I'll just wake up.

610
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,800
You poor thing.

611
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,900
Briarwood Place, you said?

612
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,500
Uh-huh.

613
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,100
What I should do right now
is walk up to that door,

614
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,400
knock on it
and tell your folks

615
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,000
where it is I found
you tonight,

616
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,500
but I'm not gonna do that

617
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,300
'cause I suspect
you're smart enough

618
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,000
to know when you've dodged
a bullet.

619
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,000
Now get out of here.

620
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,300
Can my friend come with me?

621
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,700
Her parents, they're
not gonna understand.

622
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,700
Why don't you let me worry
about that?

623
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,200
Or would you rather I escort you
to your door?

624
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,400
No, that's okay.

625
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,400
What'd you say your
name was, young lady?

626
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,700
Casey.

627
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,000
Well, it sounds like your
parents are real strict, huh?

628
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,600
Yeah, that's what I hear.

629
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,800
Yeah. They wouldn't be
too happy if they found out

630
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,000
what you were doing tonight,
would they?

631
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,200
Yeah, but you're not really
gonna tell them.

632
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,300
(sighs)
Well, that depends.

633
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,300
There's my street.

634
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,300
I suppose I could

635
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,000
do you a favor
and not say anything.

636
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,300
You're passing it.

637
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,400
First, you have
to do me a favor.

638
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,100
I'd really like to wake up now.

639
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,100
Pardon me?
Did you say something?

640
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,800
You missed my street.

641
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,600
It's okay.

642
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,900
We're just talking,

643
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,600
getting to know each other.

644
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,900
Okay, I'd really like
to wake up now!

645
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,700
You're a pretty girl,
Casey.

646
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,100
Know that?

647
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,300
A really pretty girl.

648
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Ariel!

649
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,400
You okay?

650
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,800
What is it?
What is it?!

651
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,200
I couldn't wake up!
I couldn't wake up!

652
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,900
It was so horrible!

653
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,700
???

654
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,800
She's asleep
in our bed.

655
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,400
Well, I'm grateful
that someone is.

656
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,800
Um, I got to ask.

657
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,300
How much of that
actually happened?

658
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,900
Want to hear something scary?

659
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,200
All of it. At least
all of it I was there for.

660
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,700
It happened just like that.

661
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,400
I never heard about
Casey being attacked.

662
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,100
You did say you didn't see

663
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,000
that much of her
after that night.

664
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,600
You know, I don't think
I ever spoke to her after that.

665
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,500
I always assumed
it was her parents.

666
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,800
You know what?
I have to find her.

667
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
I have to talk
to her about this.

668
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,500
Tunstell.
T-U-N-S-T-E-L-L.

669
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,000
You know, she could
be married by now.

670
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,700
Her first name,
you know,

671
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,900
could be Cassandra,
for all I know.

672
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,600
I found her, I think.

673
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,500
Well, what
took you so long?

674
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,500
Okay, this is from
the <i>Flagstaff Examiner.</i>

675
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,700
"Pinecrest resident
Casey Tunstell..."

676
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,700
What? What?
Why'd you stop reading?

677
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,300
Ah, she's dead, Al.

678
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Killed in a car accident
almost 12 years ago.

679
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,800
Oh, my God, Casey...

680
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,300
According to this,

681
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,100
she hit a deer.

682
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,400
You know, in all those dreams,
Ariel was Casey.

683
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,400
in the car wreck dreams
that I had

684
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,200
and the high school dreams
that Ariel had.

685
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,600
I just, I can't figure out
the why of it.

686
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,100
I mean, why show us
these things now?

687
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,700
What does it have
to do with anything?

688
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,100
I don't know. It doesn't
make any sense.

689
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,000
A guy attacked her
20 years ago

690
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,100
and she didn't say
anything then when
she was alive.

691
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,300
I mean, why now?

692
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,600
That cop was some judge
of character.

693
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,100
He knew the only way
that Casey could accuse him

694
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,500
of anything would be for her
to tell her parents,

695
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,100
to admit to them
that she snuck out again,

696
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,200
that she disobeyed them again.

697
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,900
And he could sense
she would never do that.

698
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,600
What I don't get
is why I didn't see it.

699
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,100
I was in that car
with him, too.

700
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,700
I let him drive off with her.

701
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,000
Come on, Allison.

702
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,500
You're a teenager.
He's a police officer.

703
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,300
I mean, how do you not
get in that car?

704
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,300
Wait a minute.
Say that again.

705
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,200
When you're that age,
when you're in high school,

706
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,800
I mean, how do you not get
into a police officer's car

707
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,000
when he tells you to?

708
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,000
Good morning.

709
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,400
Good morning. I appreciate you
coming over so quickly.

710
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,000
Oh, that's all right.
I needed to see you anyway.

711
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,200
Now's as good a time as any.

712
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,400
This, uh, obviously isn't
working out.

713
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,100
It's certainly not working out
for me, for my clients.

714
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,200
Melanie's parents
have called in the FBI.

715
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,900
I'll need her books
and things back.

716
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,400
I've been asked to surrender
them to the federal authorities.

717
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,700
As for the money I've paid
you to date, well...

718
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,600
But, uh, going forward,

719
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,400
I don't really believe
there is any going forward.

720
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,800
(sighs) Well, I am sorry
that you feel that way,

721
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,700
especially now that I have
a pretty good idea

722
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,100
how to find her and I was
counting on you for your help,

723
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,200
but let me go get those books.

724
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,600
Um, Allison...

725
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,100
Uh, let me see if I understand
this correctly.

726
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,700
You want a copy of
the I.D. photos

727
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,500
of every officer
working in 1987.

728
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,700
I do.

729
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,400
Wouldn't it just be simpler
to bring whoever

730
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,500
this secret informant is
into the station here

731
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:01,500
and have him or her
just look over the files?

732
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
It's not gonna happen,
Detective.

733
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,000
And time is of the essence.

734
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,900
It's our guy.

735
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,900
Can I help you?

736
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,300
Ben Talmadge?

737
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,300
 <i>Officer</i> Ben Talmadge.

738
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,800
What can I do for you,
Detective?

739
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,600
I was wondering
if I might take a look
inside your house.

740
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,000
You have a warrant?

741
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,700
No, but I can
get one.

742
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,900
We can all wait
around till it arrives,

743
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,900
or you can invite me in
to take a look around.

744
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,900
You know, I retire...
a week and a half.

745
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,700
Made a lot of, a lot of plans.

746
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,600
A lot of preparations.

747
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,200
You're not gonna do anything
to screw that up,

748
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,100
are you, Detective?

749
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,900
That'd be up to you, sir.

750
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,300
That'd be up to you.

751
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,400
REPORTER:
 <i>16-year-old Melanie Daniels</i>

752
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,000
was rescued late this evening

753
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,800
after being missing
for four days,

754
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,200
based on information supplied
by Ameritips,

755
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,200
which aided in the investigation
at the parents' request.

756
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,900
Her abductor, a policeman,
is believed to have lured

757
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,200
the 16-year-old
into his patrol car

758
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,100
and kept her prisoner in the
basement of his home...

759
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,900
Come on. Time to
get up, go to bed.

760
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,300
It's 2:00
in the morning.

761
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,600
Wait a second.
I was watching that.
No, you weren't.

762
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,800
That's the 2:00 a.m.
rebroadcast of the
11:00 news.

763
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,100
You've seen it already.

764
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,200
To hear them tell it,

765
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,300
Ameritips did the whole
thing by themselves.

766
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,400
Your friend Cynthia's
gonna be very happy.

767
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,600
No mention of you,
no mention of Ariel.

768
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,100
Well, that's fine
with me.

769
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,300
I'm just happy
that the girl's safe

770
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,900
and I'm still on the payroll.

771
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,200
You go ahead.
I'll be in in a minute.

772
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,200
* There is freedom within *

773
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,400
* There is freedom without *

774
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,400
* Try to catch the deluge
in a paper cup... *

775
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,000
You know, I'm really glad
we're doing this.

776
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,500
You don't hate me?
Come on, Mom.

777
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,600
I wouldn't be
having this dream
if I hated you.

778
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,500
* Many battles are lost, but
you'll never see *

779
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,900
* The end of the road while
you're traveling with me *

780
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:21,200
* Hey now, hey now,
don't dream it's over... *

781
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:26,100
