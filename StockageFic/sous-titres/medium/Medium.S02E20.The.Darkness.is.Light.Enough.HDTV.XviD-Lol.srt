00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:20,434
WOMAN:
Hello?

2
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:21,601
Hello?

3
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:45,901
WOMAN:
Hello?

4
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:48,868
Hello?

5
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:19,801
WOMAN:
Hello?

8
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:42,567
Mom, next time
can I pour the milk?

9
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:43,767
We'll see, sweetie.

10
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:45,900
You have to be able
to get it in the bowl.

11
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:47,067
Ariel...

12
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,067
BRIDGETTE:
I can do that.

13
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,667
I pour good.

14
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:51,900
You don't pour good,
you pour well.

15
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:54,067
Okay, so when
can I start pouring?

16
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:56,401
As soon as they
get rid of gravity.

17
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,633
First we have to promote you
to cereal pouring detail.

18
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,134
I'm getting a promotion?

19
00:03:01,201 --> 00:03:02,667
Starting tomorrow.

20
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,500
We'll start with the cereal,
we'll see how it goes.

21
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:05,533
Then we'll think about milk.

22
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,867
I'm getting a promotion!

23
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,334
Girls, keep it down
to a dull roar.

24
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,500
Your dad's still
sleeping.

25
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:13,001
( <i>grumbling</i> ):
No, he's not.

26
00:03:17,034 --> 00:03:19,001
Aren't you going
to have any breakfast?

27
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:20,567
This is breakfast.

28
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,534
I got out of there ten of 2:00,
and what is it now-- it's 7:20.

29
00:03:26,601 --> 00:03:28,968
I've got to be back
there in 45 minutes.

30
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,701
It's been over a week
now like this.

31
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,367
No wonder you're so tired.

32
00:03:32,434 --> 00:03:34,001
They got guys working
on this project

33
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:35,500
in their late 20s.

34
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:38,334
They're out of there, like,
7:00, 8:00 at night.

35
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,867
They can do the work
while talking

36
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:43,601
on their cell phone
at the same time

37
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,701
that they're checking a blog
and e-mailing a friend.

38
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:50,634
I'm barely 40,
and I feel like an antique.

39
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:52,233
Well, that's crazy.

40
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,867
You've been there
nine years.

41
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,801
You have more experience
than anyone else.

42
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:58,701
Yeah, I cost them more
than anyone else, too.

43
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:02,334
I just... I can't
shake the feeling

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,534
that this project is some kind
of a bake-off.

45
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:06,034
That when it's all done,

46
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,901
the winner is going to get
a pat on the back,

47
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:09,701
the loser's going to get
shown out the door.

48
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,667
What do you mean loser?

49
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:13,567
It's a project,
not a contest.

50
00:04:13,634 --> 00:04:14,867
How do you know?

51
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:16,667
I don't <i>know.</i>

52
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:19,968
Well, okay then.
I work there. I do.

53
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:24,701
I feel like I never see you.

54
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:26,867
That's because
you never do see me.

55
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:33,200
I don't get a kiss?

56
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:34,200
Huh?

57
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:35,834
Nothing.

58
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:39,334
I'll see you tonight,
or whenever.

59
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:42,334
Sir?
Yep.

60
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,734
I have those parole applications
you asked me to take a look at.

61
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:47,968
Great. Anything in there
jump out at you?

62
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:49,300
Not really.

63
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:50,767
Just a collection of horrible
human beings

64
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:52,167
looking for a little mercy

65
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:54,400
despite the fact that they had
none for their victims.

66
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:55,801
Yeah, today is the day.

67
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:57,801
Parole board hearings. Yahoo.

68
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:59,801
Nothing like
spending time

69
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:02,200
in a concrete bunker listening
to a bunch of vermin

70
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:04,934
swear that they've
seen the light, found the way,

71
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:06,901
and if only you'll
let them out into society

72
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:08,634
they'll cure cancer and
make the world safe

73
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:10,100
for old ladies
and orphans.

74
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:12,767
Care to come with?

75
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:17,767
Is there a problem?

76
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:20,867
Oh, no. I just have
to pick up my girls from school.

77
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:22,734
Joe's been working crazy hours
on this project.

78
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:23,968
That shouldn't be a problem.

79
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:25,567
This will only take
a couple hours.

80
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:29,834
So how does this work?

81
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:31,534
It's pretty
cut and dried.

82
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:33,300
The prisoner is announced
by the parole board.

83
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,133
He's given an opportunity
to make his statement--

84
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,001
express remorse
for his crimes.

85
00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:38,701
Once the board
has her his request,

86
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:40,634
they'll ask if we have
any objections.

87
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:46,667
MAN:
Tell us about the crime
you committed, Mr. Cosgrove.

88
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:48,434
I shot my wife.

89
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:53,500
You shot her 16
times, Mr. Cosgrove,

90
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:54,901
in the back.

91
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:56,901
You killed her.

92
00:05:56,968 --> 00:06:00,133
What the board needs to
determine at this time

93
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,601
is do you regret that you
committed this crime?

94
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,133
I do, sir.

95
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,034
I regret it every day
of my life.

96
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,601
I'm a very different man

97
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:10,767
from the one who arrived here
ten years ago.

98
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,767
I work hard
to be a better person.

99
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:14,534
I gave my life
over to the Lord.

100
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:19,300
Would the State
care to comment?

101
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:21,434
Due to the heinous nature
of this crime,

102
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,167
as well as to the fact
that, to my recollection,

103
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:25,968
this prisoner has never
shown any remorse

104
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:27,601
before this hearing,

105
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:30,233
the State would ask that parole
be denied at this time.

106
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,034
MAN:
The board is
inclined to agree.

107
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,767
Parole is denied.

108
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:36,968
Don't worry, just
one more to go.

109
00:06:37,034 --> 00:06:38,934
The board will now
consider the petition

110
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:40,534
of Mr. Sam Elkin.

111
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,867
You've served five years

112
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:44,767
of a life sentence,
and this is the first time

113
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,233
you've been eligible to appear

114
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,034
before the parole board,
correct?

115
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,801
Yes, sir.

116
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,500
That's correct, sir.

117
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:53,834
Tell us about
your crime, Mr. Elkin.

118
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,667
Mr. Elkin?

119
00:06:57,734 --> 00:06:59,667
You know what I did.

120
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:02,934
It's important that
we hear it from you.

121
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:09,068
I guess I kidnapped
my girlfriend...

122
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:11,068
my ex-girlfriend.

123
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:14,068
We broke up

124
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,434
about a month before...

125
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,133
she broke up-- it was her idea.

126
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,467
I waited for her in her car.

127
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:22,867
I had a key.

128
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:24,567
She used to let me use it.

129
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:26,434
Anyway, I waited for her.

130
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,734
I knew she'd be going out.

131
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:32,867
It was Tuesday.
She always went out on Tuesdays.

132
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,901
I forced her to drive
out into the desert.

133
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:41,400
And once
we were there,

134
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:43,767
we... we did it.

135
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:47,100
I... I made her do it.

136
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:54,300
When we were done,
I just, uh, started choking her.

137
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,867
She was tiny.

138
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:56,934
It didn't take long.

139
00:07:57,001 --> 00:08:00,734
It was almost
morning by then,

140
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:03,334
so I drove her car back
into the city

141
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,634
with her dead body
in the passenger seat.

142
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:11,034
Pulled into a busy car wash
on Bell Road.

143
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,467
The kind with two lanes--

144
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,434
one where they clean
the inside, and an express

145
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,567
where the car just goes
through unattended

146
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:20,968
and they clean
the outside.

147
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,701
Once the car
was inside the wash,

148
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:27,534
I, uh, just turned
and walked away.

149
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:41,200
That's what you needed
to hear, right?

150
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:44,367
MAN:
It's my understanding

151
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:47,100
that until you became
eligible for parole this month,

152
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:50,934
you repeatedly denied
committing any
of these crimes.

153
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:53,001
Uh, yes, sir.

154
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:54,968
And I regret that, sir.

155
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,434
Mr. District Attorney?

156
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,834
While I am moved
to finally hear Mr. Elkin

157
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:04,500
admit to these
heinous acts,

158
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:06,901
I can't help
but be suspicious
of his motives.

159
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:08,701
Mr. Elkin is, after all,

160
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:11,233
well aware that taking
responsibility
for his crimes

161
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,233
is a condition
of his parole eligibility.

162
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,968
Perhaps his apology
and remorse will
carry more weight

163
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:18,801
when he has another five
years to sleep on them.

164
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:31,104
Hello?

165
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:10,904
I'm lonely.

166
00:10:10,971 --> 00:10:12,404
Hi, lonely.

167
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,737
My name's Joe.

168
00:10:13,804 --> 00:10:15,038
So what do you think?

169
00:10:15,104 --> 00:10:16,470
What are the chances
I'll see you

170
00:10:16,537 --> 00:10:17,937
before today becomes tomorrow?

171
00:10:18,004 --> 00:10:20,303
Uh, you wouldn't happen to know

172
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,303
what the temperature
in hell is, would you?

173
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,437
You haven't heard anything about
a big freeze, maybe?

174
00:10:25,504 --> 00:10:28,303
They didn't mention it
on the news, no.

175
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,470
Mm. Then I'm probably
going to be here for a while.

176
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:34,971
Talk to me.

177
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:37,203
Tell me about your day.

178
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,504
I sat in on
a parole hearing today.

179
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,237
Heard this guy confess
that he killed his girlfriend.

180
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:48,203
I got this strong feeling
that he didn't do it.

181
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,737
And?

182
00:10:50,804 --> 00:10:54,237
And I just had a dream about him
kissing this woman.

183
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:55,737
The dead girlfriend?

184
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:57,071
Someone else.

185
00:10:57,138 --> 00:10:58,437
You know what I think?

186
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:00,904
I think you've got
kissing on the brain.

187
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:03,370
No one's kissed me on the brain,

188
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:04,904
or anywhere else
for that matter,

189
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:06,937
for quite some time.

190
00:11:07,004 --> 00:11:08,604
Oops.

191
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,804
I think break time is over.

192
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:13,004
Love you, too.

193
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:15,570
Love you, three.

194
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,138
Whatever you want,

195
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:41,437
you're going to have
to do it yourself.

196
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:43,437
Not funny.

197
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:45,270
When did you get in?

198
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,771
I don't know.

199
00:11:46,837 --> 00:11:49,671
I couldn't bear to
look at the clock.

200
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:52,937
I really have to
get some sleep.

201
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,270
I just found out

202
00:11:54,337 --> 00:11:55,437
the client's
coming in tomorrow

203
00:11:55,504 --> 00:11:58,604
at 3:00 for an update.

204
00:11:58,671 --> 00:12:00,604
Oh, crap.

205
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:00,904
What?

206
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:04,370
Did we ever get my
suit pants fixed

207
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:06,104
after the cuff came
unraveled at Christmas?

208
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:11,470
"We"? If by "we,"
you really mean "me," then no.

209
00:12:11,537 --> 00:12:13,470
"We" didn't know
about your cuff.

210
00:12:13,537 --> 00:12:14,804
Okay, forget it.

211
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:17,237
I'll wear shorts
and a T-shirt.

212
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,470
I can go straight
from the meeting
to unemployment

213
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:21,470
and then directly
to the car wash

214
00:12:21,537 --> 00:12:23,971
to look for a job.

215
00:12:25,038 --> 00:12:27,637
Psst! Hoo-hoo...

216
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:30,971
Hey... there is a tailor

217
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:33,637
who works at the mall
by City Hall

218
00:12:33,704 --> 00:12:35,804
who does alterations
while you wait.

219
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:38,303
I can drop them off
first thing

220
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,937
and pick them up
at lunch.

221
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:43,237
Wow.

222
00:12:43,303 --> 00:12:44,570
On second thought,

223
00:12:44,637 --> 00:12:46,771
bring those brains
of yours over here.

224
00:12:46,837 --> 00:12:49,637
I think I do feel
like kissing them.

225
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:04,870
WOMAN:
No, I just felt him there,

226
00:13:04,937 --> 00:13:08,204
and he was standing over my bed,
just looming there.

227
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:10,371
And then he
leaned down...

228
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:12,638
and then he
kissed me.

229
00:13:17,537 --> 00:13:20,371
You'd better not be playing
solitaire on that computer.

230
00:13:20,437 --> 00:13:22,571
It's almost 2:00.
You're cutting it close.

231
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:24,738
( <i>sighs</i> ):
You're welcome.

232
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,404
I'm sorry. There was
a thank you in there.

233
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:27,571
You just didn't hear it.

234
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:28,903
Well, you're right.

235
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,037
I'm running late.

236
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:33,604
Ah! Ah!

237
00:13:33,671 --> 00:13:36,004
The strangest thing happened
to me on the way over here.

238
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,137
I saw this woman.

239
00:13:38,204 --> 00:13:41,170
She looked just like that girl
I've been seeing in my dreams--

240
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,970
the one who keeps
getting kissed?

241
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:44,638
She was going
up an escalator.

242
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:45,704
I was going down.

243
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,237
Geez.

244
00:14:02,304 --> 00:14:04,870
There's no reason
some stranger in a mall

245
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:07,371
should be getting
all the action.

246
00:14:07,437 --> 00:14:09,537
I'm sorry
I haven't been around.

247
00:14:09,604 --> 00:14:11,204
Thank you for lunch.

248
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:13,404
You tip all the delivery
people that way,

249
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:15,271
or was that
special for me?

250
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:18,137
Mm...
Yeah?

251
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:21,037
Forgive me, Mr. Dubois.

252
00:14:21,104 --> 00:14:22,704
I just wanted to
remind you we're going

253
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,371
to be leaving
in approximately
30 minutes.

254
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:25,903
I'm all over it, Edrick.

255
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,404
I'm just going to grab
a bite to eat,

256
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:28,571
and then I'm going
to change.

257
00:14:28,638 --> 00:14:30,671
Edrick, this is
my wife, Allison.

258
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:31,903
Allison, this
is Edrick,

259
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,903
who is single-handedly
making it tough

260
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,571
for mere mortals like me

261
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:38,504
to have to work anything less
than a 24-hour day.

262
00:14:41,803 --> 00:14:43,837
( <i>whimpering</i> ):
Joe...

263
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:45,571
I need your help...

264
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:49,004
JOE:
Allison?

265
00:14:53,437 --> 00:14:56,170
Uh...

266
00:14:56,237 --> 00:14:57,903
Edrick?

267
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,504
First generation American.

268
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:01,204
My parents didn't
speak much English

269
00:15:01,271 --> 00:15:03,704
when I was born, but they
loved American names.

270
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,037
Couldn't decide
between Ed and Rick.

271
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:08,504
Ed-Rick.

272
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:09,571
Nice meeting you,
Mrs. Dubois.

273
00:15:09,638 --> 00:15:10,571
Thirty...

274
00:15:10,638 --> 00:15:12,204
Minutes.

275
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:14,304
I'm counting
the seconds.

276
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,537
The Elkin case? Sam Elkin?

277
00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:18,537
Why would you want
to revisit the Elkin case?

278
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:20,870
It's five years old.
The case is closed.

279
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:22,204
The accused man confessed.

280
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:23,870
Call me old-fashioned,

281
00:15:23,937 --> 00:15:25,304
but if you want
to revisit old cases,

282
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:27,271
I'd certainly prefer that
you find one that's unsolved

283
00:15:27,337 --> 00:15:29,204
and where the guilty party
isn't already behind bars.

284
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:30,937
I told you yesterday
I felt strongly

285
00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:32,837
I'm starting to regret
asking you to come with.
that Elkin's lying.

286
00:15:32,903 --> 00:15:34,704
And I told you yesterday
I completely agree.

287
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,104
He was lying...

288
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,237
about feeling badly,
about being filled with remorse,

289
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,371
about his supposed concern

290
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:41,337
for Amanda Crane's friends
and family.

291
00:15:41,404 --> 00:15:42,504
I have court.

292
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:44,237
Mr. District Attorney...

293
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:47,170
Allison, look at the
coroner's report.

294
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,471
I did.

295
00:15:48,537 --> 00:15:49,437
Then you know
that Elkin's sperm

296
00:15:49,504 --> 00:15:50,803
was still inside
the victim

297
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,237
when we recovered
her body.

298
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:53,170
There's got to
be something more

299
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:54,271
than just your sense

300
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:56,004
that this man wasn't
being truthful.

301
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,671
I've been having
this dream...

302
00:15:57,738 --> 00:15:58,837
Uh-huh.

303
00:15:58,903 --> 00:16:00,170
This woman--
not the victim--

304
00:16:00,237 --> 00:16:01,504
she's lying in bed
in the dark.

305
00:16:01,571 --> 00:16:03,170
Her lover comes up
and steals a kiss.

306
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:04,337
Sounds romantic.

307
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:07,037
Up until last night,
the man had no face.

308
00:16:07,104 --> 00:16:09,371
Now I see it's Sam Elkin.

309
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:11,037
I'm not sure I know
what that means.

310
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,704
I'm not sure I know
what it means, either,

311
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,704
but I actually saw
this woman today,

312
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,037
a block away from here
at the mall.

313
00:16:17,104 --> 00:16:18,870
Seems to me
there must be some reason

314
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,371
I'm dreaming these dreams,

315
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,870
some reason
I met Elkin yesterday,

316
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:27,371
some reason I crossed paths
with this woman today.

317
00:16:27,437 --> 00:16:29,204
Go talk to Scanlon.

318
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:31,070
If the two of you can find
something in the file

319
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:32,070
worth looking at...

320
00:16:32,137 --> 00:16:33,571
Thank you.

321
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,837
Excuse me, uh,
I'm looking

322
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:49,170
for Detective
Lee Scanlon.

323
00:16:49,237 --> 00:16:50,837
That's his desk
over there.

324
00:16:50,903 --> 00:16:53,738
Must have stepped out
for a second.

325
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,671
Excuse me.

326
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,170
Uh, you look a bit upset.

327
00:17:12,237 --> 00:17:14,371
My name's, uh,
Allison Dubois.

328
00:17:14,437 --> 00:17:16,037
I work with the District
Attorney's Office.

329
00:17:16,104 --> 00:17:18,704
I was wondering if I can be
of some kind of help to you.

330
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,204
I don't know.

331
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:21,870
I've been waiting
to see a detective

332
00:17:21,937 --> 00:17:23,371
since early
this morning.

333
00:17:23,437 --> 00:17:24,704
I came here
with a friend.

334
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,037
We waited for an
hour and a half,

335
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:27,537
then they told us to
go away for an hour.

336
00:17:27,604 --> 00:17:30,037
So we took a walk around
the mall, came back.

337
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:32,037
Then they said it
would be another
two to three hours.

338
00:17:32,104 --> 00:17:34,037
My friend finally had to leave.

339
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:35,638
I'm missing a day's work.

340
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:37,371
You know what?

341
00:17:37,437 --> 00:17:39,638
I work with one
of the detectives here.

342
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:41,770
Let me see if I can't get him
to talk to you.

343
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:44,537
Oh, thanks. That would be great.

344
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:48,738
Thank you.

345
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:55,420
I'm sorry, Miss...?

346
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:56,754
Walsh.

347
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:58,253
Kathleen Walsh.

348
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,654
I'm not married.

349
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:01,587
Mrs. Dubois explained you've
been waiting a long while.

350
00:18:01,654 --> 00:18:03,188
What can we help you with?

351
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:05,587
Well, I should tell you,
I called the police
yesterday morning.

352
00:18:05,654 --> 00:18:06,887
They came by
my house, but...

353
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:09,320
Start from the beginning.
Tell us what happened.

354
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,587
Six months ago, I
moved to Phoenix--

355
00:18:12,654 --> 00:18:14,420
just before the start
of the school year.

356
00:18:14,487 --> 00:18:16,253
I teach music.

357
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,253
Anyway, I found this
wonderful apartment

358
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,420
for very little money.

359
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:24,220
But shortly after
I settled in,

360
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:26,954
I began to hear noises...
only at night.

361
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:29,821
They'd start just as I was
getting ready for bed.

362
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:35,721
Do you have any pets?

363
00:18:35,787 --> 00:18:37,721
A cat-- Boots.

364
00:18:38,854 --> 00:18:40,520
<i>But I've had him,</i>
<i>like, forever.</i>

365
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:43,253
He doesn't make
these sounds.

366
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,554
Okay, so you heard
there sounds...

367
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,854
Yeah. I would
call out,

368
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:47,054
but no one
would answer.

369
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:48,887
Uh, this would happen...

370
00:18:48,954 --> 00:18:51,287
like, three, maybe
four times a week.

371
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:52,921
So what'd you do?

372
00:18:52,987 --> 00:18:54,054
I didn't think

373
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:56,188
that there was
anything to do.

374
00:18:56,253 --> 00:18:58,587
I wasn't certain that
there was anything
really there...

375
00:18:58,654 --> 00:19:01,787
so frankly, for a long
time, I did nothing.

376
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:04,487
But then the noises
started to change.

377
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:06,454
What do you mean? Change how?

378
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,587
Well, there was
this clicking sound.

379
00:19:09,654 --> 00:19:10,587
Clicking?

380
00:19:10,654 --> 00:19:11,821
Um...

381
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:16,721
A camera.

382
00:19:16,787 --> 00:19:18,154
Huh?

383
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,721
I was wondering if you thought
it sounded like a camera.

384
00:19:20,787 --> 00:19:23,821
Um... I don't know.

385
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:25,587
Okay. Whatever it was,

386
00:19:25,654 --> 00:19:27,554
there's this new sound.

387
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,287
And I ignored that
for a while, too.

388
00:19:29,353 --> 00:19:31,787
But then two
nights ago...

389
00:19:31,854 --> 00:19:34,121
I felt him there...

390
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:36,287
close.

391
00:19:36,353 --> 00:19:38,854
He was standing
over the bed.

392
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:41,620
Forgive me for asking,
but how do you know that?

393
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:43,353
How do you know he was there?

394
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:52,554
Stand up.

395
00:19:53,587 --> 00:19:55,121
Excuse me?

396
00:19:55,188 --> 00:19:57,021
Would you stand up, please?

397
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:03,854
Close your eyes.

398
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:18,021
Any questions?

399
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:21,620
No.

400
00:20:35,587 --> 00:20:37,954
And then?

401
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,021
He kissed me.

402
00:20:42,088 --> 00:20:43,754
Hmm.

403
00:20:43,821 --> 00:20:46,320
So what'd you do?

404
00:20:46,387 --> 00:20:47,754
I screamed.

405
00:20:47,821 --> 00:20:50,088
And then he was gone.

406
00:20:50,154 --> 00:20:52,253
And then I
called the police,

407
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,088
and then the
police came over.

408
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:55,387
And then--

409
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,921
I have no way
of proving this...

410
00:20:57,987 --> 00:21:00,021
but I think they
laughed at me.

411
00:21:00,088 --> 00:21:01,220
Whoa, hold it, you're...

412
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:02,587
I want to make sure
I've got this right.

413
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:04,253
You're not alleging
that this guy raped you,

414
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,721
struck you, fondled you?

415
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:09,287
A man broke into my apartment...

416
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:11,021
and he kissed me.

417
00:21:14,188 --> 00:21:15,420
Miss Walsh...

418
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:17,287
You're going to tell me
to change the locks,

419
00:21:17,353 --> 00:21:19,921
move in with a friend...

420
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:23,387
buy a big dog?

421
00:21:24,387 --> 00:21:27,287
Can I see you, Allison, uh...

422
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,454
in private for one second?

423
00:21:31,554 --> 00:21:33,220
What are you doing to me?

424
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:34,520
What am I doing to <i>you?</i>

425
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:35,887
Shouldn't the question be

426
00:21:35,954 --> 00:21:37,487
what are you gonna
do for that woman?

427
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:38,954
Uh, no.
I don't think so.

428
00:21:39,021 --> 00:21:40,121
What is your problem?

429
00:21:40,188 --> 00:21:41,721
She's clearly being victimized.

430
00:21:41,787 --> 00:21:43,287
She came to you
for help.

431
00:21:43,353 --> 00:21:44,287
Victimized?

432
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:46,387
A man keeps breaking

433
00:21:46,454 --> 00:21:47,954
into her apartment.
Maybe.

434
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:49,154
No. Not maybe.

435
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,587
Based on what she's telling me,

436
00:21:50,654 --> 00:21:51,887
the police who went
into her apartment

437
00:21:51,954 --> 00:21:53,520
couldn't find any evidence
of a break in.

438
00:21:53,587 --> 00:21:54,554
And obviously,
there's no witnesses.

439
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,754
She is a witness.

440
00:21:56,821 --> 00:21:58,088
I don't think so. To what?

441
00:21:58,154 --> 00:21:59,887
To the breaking and entering.

442
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:01,154
Well it doesn't actually appear

443
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,154
as though there was
any breaking.

444
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,787
Which would lead me to suspect

445
00:22:03,854 --> 00:22:05,188
that there probably wasn't
any real entering, either.

446
00:22:05,253 --> 00:22:06,787
So what do you want me to do?

447
00:22:06,854 --> 00:22:09,054
Protect her.
From what?

448
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:10,821
This dangerous band
of marauders and thieves

449
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:13,887
who may have broken into her
place and stolen, what, a kiss?

450
00:22:13,954 --> 00:22:15,921
What are you so hot about?

451
00:22:15,987 --> 00:22:17,287
You don't even
know this lady?

452
00:22:17,353 --> 00:22:19,754
Didn't you just tell me
you met her ten minutes ago?

453
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:22,287
I know what she's
telling us is true-- I saw it.

454
00:22:22,353 --> 00:22:23,487
Oh, you were there?

455
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:28,954
And I saw something else, too.

456
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:30,854
A man who's serving
a life sentence

457
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:33,353
for a murder that
I don't think he did,

458
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,420
he was the person
doing the kissing.

459
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,921
You're not making much sense,
if the guy's still in prison.

460
00:22:37,987 --> 00:22:40,021
I know, it doesn't make
a lot of sense

461
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:41,954
to me either.

462
00:22:45,854 --> 00:22:48,054
What do you want me
to do, Allison?

463
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,154
Ms. Walsh...

464
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,721
you ever heard
of a man

465
00:22:55,787 --> 00:22:57,520
named Sam Elkin?

466
00:22:57,587 --> 00:23:00,787
No. Doesn't ring a bell. Why?

467
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:02,620
Uh, never mind. No big deal.

468
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:07,220
I've conferred with Mrs. Dubois
here and we've decided

469
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:09,188
to post a visible
police presence

470
00:23:09,253 --> 00:23:10,320
right outside
your building.

471
00:23:10,387 --> 00:23:12,154
They'll be there
24 hours a day,

472
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,154
and if anyone comes in
or out, they'll see it.

473
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,554
Additionally, we'll set up

474
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,987
a direct phone link
to your apartment.

475
00:23:17,054 --> 00:23:18,554
If anyone does come in,

476
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,287
you just pick up that phone
and we're there.

477
00:23:20,353 --> 00:23:22,721
Wow. That's great.

478
00:23:22,787 --> 00:23:24,287
I was just hoping that maybe

479
00:23:24,353 --> 00:23:26,721
you could send someone over
to take a second look.

480
00:23:26,787 --> 00:23:29,587
Really?

481
00:23:31,253 --> 00:23:33,188
I wouldn't hear of it.

482
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:34,754
This kissing thing,

483
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:37,387
that's not something
I want to play around with.

484
00:23:37,454 --> 00:23:38,821
Well, thank you.

485
00:23:38,887 --> 00:23:42,487
And thank you, Mrs. Dubois.

486
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,687
Oh, no, it's nothing.
That's what we're here for.

487
00:23:45,997 --> 00:23:48,497
???

488
00:23:53,971 --> 00:23:55,804
Hello?

489
00:23:55,871 --> 00:23:58,704
Hello?

490
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:03,437
Are you here?

491
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,571
Are you watching me?

492
00:24:10,537 --> 00:24:13,038
Hey.

493
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:17,637
You're home,
and it's not even 12:00.

494
00:24:17,704 --> 00:24:19,804
Will wonders never cease?

495
00:24:21,704 --> 00:24:23,938
You'd almost think
that I lived here.

496
00:24:26,704 --> 00:24:28,304
Mm...

497
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,904
I missed you.

498
00:24:29,971 --> 00:24:32,871
I hate waking up
and having dreams

499
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,437
and not having you
to share them with.

500
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:37,437
Well, good.

501
00:24:37,504 --> 00:24:39,938
Because I suspect
that pretty soon,

502
00:24:40,004 --> 00:24:43,971
not only will I
be around during the
middle of the night,

503
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:46,671
but quite possibly
during the day, as well.

504
00:24:48,137 --> 00:24:50,404
What are you talking about?

505
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,737
Well, we went to
see the client today,

506
00:24:52,804 --> 00:24:54,904
and it's like
I was invisible.

507
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:57,971
Nobody really wanted
to hear from me.

508
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,170
It was The Edrick Show.

509
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:02,537
All day, all the time.

510
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:07,203
You know, the guy's been an
engineer for 15 minutes,

511
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,704
but it's like he's
Galileo the way they
hang on his every word.

512
00:25:10,771 --> 00:25:11,837
Oh.

513
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:13,470
Honey...

514
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:16,203
And not just...

515
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,070
not just the client,

516
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:21,704
but the senior guys
from our firm, as well.

517
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,704
I know that look.

518
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:26,004
I used to get
that look.

519
00:25:26,103 --> 00:25:29,771
That's the "you're the
future of this company" look.

520
00:25:29,837 --> 00:25:31,737
Hmm, I think
you're exaggerating.

521
00:25:31,804 --> 00:25:33,038
I met Edrick.

522
00:25:33,103 --> 00:25:34,771
He bows at your feet.

523
00:25:34,837 --> 00:25:36,137
He worships you.

524
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:38,337
He's got me lined up
in his crosshairs.

525
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,470
He covets my
parking space.

526
00:25:42,537 --> 00:25:46,804
He lusts after the Senior
Vice President nameplate

527
00:25:46,871 --> 00:25:48,871
on my office door.

528
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:52,304
He pines for my four extra
vacation days a year.

529
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,804
Mm.

530
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:57,404
And you know what the
surprising part is?

531
00:25:59,904 --> 00:26:02,103
I don't think I
really give a damn.

532
00:26:04,504 --> 00:26:08,704
It's good to be home.

533
00:26:08,771 --> 00:26:11,004
And you?

534
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,504
Any more kissing dreams?

535
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,604
Mm, the kissing has stopped.

536
00:26:15,671 --> 00:26:17,938
There is no kissing.

537
00:26:18,004 --> 00:26:21,604
No real clarity, either.

538
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:23,871
Hmm.

539
00:26:36,771 --> 00:26:39,337
Interview Elkin again?

540
00:26:39,404 --> 00:26:40,904
Whatever for?

541
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:42,370
I've been having these dreams.

542
00:26:42,437 --> 00:26:43,904
Allison...

543
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:46,404
All of them are very similar.

544
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,038
Up until last night,

545
00:26:48,103 --> 00:26:50,137
I thought they were
about this blind woman,

546
00:26:50,203 --> 00:26:53,004
Kathleen Walsh, being kissed
by a man who has no features,

547
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,437
being kissed by Sam Elkin.

548
00:26:54,504 --> 00:26:56,871
But then
last night,

549
00:26:56,938 --> 00:27:00,170
I had the same dream,
set in the same place,

550
00:27:00,237 --> 00:27:03,304
but Kathleen is gone.

551
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:07,771
Elkin's dead girlfriend,
Amanda Crane, is in her place.

552
00:27:07,837 --> 00:27:09,637
And this suggests?

553
00:27:09,704 --> 00:27:11,904
I don't know, but I'd like
to try and find out.

554
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,804
I don't have it,
and I couldn't do it.

555
00:27:16,871 --> 00:27:19,237
I left here at 10:30 last night.

556
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,938
No matter how
much I try,

557
00:27:21,004 --> 00:27:22,904
I can't design
with my eyes closed.

558
00:27:22,971 --> 00:27:25,737
The drawings,
the silicone diode--

559
00:27:25,804 --> 00:27:28,270
I don't have them,
I'm still working on them.

560
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:29,504
Sorry, kid.

561
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,470
I need your help.

562
00:27:34,537 --> 00:27:36,637
Excuse me?

563
00:27:36,704 --> 00:27:38,237
All my work.

564
00:27:38,304 --> 00:27:41,737
I sent it down to QC,
double-check the specs.

565
00:27:41,804 --> 00:27:44,337
None of it checked out.

566
00:27:44,404 --> 00:27:47,504
The quality control guys
called it gibberish.

567
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,737
It's only a matter of time

568
00:27:53,804 --> 00:27:56,470
before everyone upstairs
hears about it.

569
00:28:00,704 --> 00:28:03,604
I need your help, Mr. Dubois.

570
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,437
So what'd I do?

571
00:28:21,504 --> 00:28:24,203
Well, that's what I was hoping
to figure out.

572
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,270
I don't know if you remember me.

573
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:28,737
My name's Allison Dubois.

574
00:28:28,804 --> 00:28:30,571
I work with
the district attorney's office.

575
00:28:30,637 --> 00:28:33,170
I was here for your
parole hearing the other day.

576
00:28:33,237 --> 00:28:35,337
Sat right over there.

577
00:28:35,404 --> 00:28:37,671
You waiting for a thank you?

578
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,737
It's gonna be a long wait.

579
00:28:43,804 --> 00:28:46,337
Well, no, I'm not here
for a thank you.

580
00:28:46,404 --> 00:28:49,337
I'd just like
to get some questions answered.

581
00:28:49,404 --> 00:28:51,070
Well, I don't know.

582
00:28:51,137 --> 00:28:52,737
Depends on the questions.

583
00:28:52,804 --> 00:28:55,571
I mean, what's in it for me?

584
00:28:55,637 --> 00:28:58,904
Looks like I'm gonna be in here
the rest of my life.

585
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:01,404
I'm not what you'd call
highly incentivized.

586
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,671
Okay, well, let's start
with an easy one then.

587
00:29:04,737 --> 00:29:08,038
Why did you sit
there the other day

588
00:29:08,103 --> 00:29:09,270
and plead forgiveness

589
00:29:09,337 --> 00:29:11,038
for a crime
that you didn't commit?

590
00:29:11,103 --> 00:29:15,203
I mean, I know your
lawyer must have told you

591
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,971
your only chance of parole was
for you to come in and sit there

592
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:21,370
and tell the board
what they wanted to hear,

593
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:23,470
but I'm here to tell you,

594
00:29:23,537 --> 00:29:28,504
I <i>strongly</i> suspect that you
did not commit that crime.

595
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:31,404
Now, I'm not on the
board, and I'm with

596
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,804
the district attorney's office,
but I'm no attorney,

597
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:36,304
so I can't really
promise you anything.

598
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:39,103
But if you have a story to tell,

599
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,470
I would like to hear it.

600
00:29:41,537 --> 00:29:43,604
And if I believe you,

601
00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:46,504
I will do everything I can

602
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:48,771
to be sure
that everyone listens.

603
00:29:53,671 --> 00:29:55,804
I loved Amanda Crane.

604
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:58,404
She was
a college girl,

605
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,504
I was a guy who fixed cars.

606
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:04,304
Her friends didn't think
much of me.

607
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,304
Her family didn't think
much of me.

608
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,904
But I loved her.

609
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:11,103
We went together for months.

610
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:15,270
<i>Used to spend almost</i>
<i>every day together.</i>

611
00:30:15,337 --> 00:30:19,571
<i>Every day except Tuesdays.</i>

612
00:30:19,637 --> 00:30:22,337
<i>At first, she was always</i>
<i>coming up with excuses.</i>

613
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:25,437
<i>I have a test,</i>
<i>I have a paper due.</i>

614
00:30:25,504 --> 00:30:28,704
<i>Then she switched her story</i>
<i>on me.</i>

615
00:30:28,771 --> 00:30:32,470
<i>Said she had a job,</i>
<i>she had to work.</i>

616
00:30:32,537 --> 00:30:34,804
Didn't really bother me
at first.

617
00:30:34,871 --> 00:30:36,671
Didn't think much of it.

618
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:39,203
Then I lost my wallet one night,

619
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,404
had no money to get home.

620
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,671
I went over to her dorm,
she wasn't there.

621
00:30:44,737 --> 00:30:46,704
It was 3:00 in the morning.

622
00:30:46,771 --> 00:30:50,904
Next day she tells me
she was working all night.

623
00:30:50,971 --> 00:30:53,504
"Doing what?" I said.

624
00:30:53,571 --> 00:30:57,404
That's when things started
to get strange.

625
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,404
For a while,
she wouldn't tell me,

626
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,804
but I wouldn't let it go.

627
00:31:01,871 --> 00:31:04,103
I was like a dog with a bone.

628
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:09,137
Finally, one night,
she tells me.

629
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:10,704
She met a man.

630
00:31:10,771 --> 00:31:15,203
He offered to pay her way
through school.

631
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:18,637
<i>All she had to do was go over</i>
<i>to this apartment he owned.</i>

632
00:31:18,704 --> 00:31:20,304
<i>When she gets inside,</i>

633
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,871
<i>she puts on a blindfold,</i>
<i>spends the night.</i>

634
00:31:22,938 --> 00:31:25,203
And do what?
Exactly.

635
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,170
That's what I wanted to know.

636
00:31:27,237 --> 00:31:29,871
<i>She swears to me,</i>
<i>she's not doing anything.</i>

637
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:32,470
<i>She just puts on a blindfold,</i>
<i>takes off her clothes,</i>

638
00:31:32,537 --> 00:31:35,004
<i>puts on a nightgown,</i>
<i>goes to bed.</i>

639
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,170
<i>Got up the next morning,</i>

640
00:31:37,237 --> 00:31:39,671
<i>put her clothes back on,</i>
<i>took the blindfold off,</i>

641
00:31:39,737 --> 00:31:42,637
<i>and walked out the door.</i>

642
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:44,404
And that was it?

643
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,370
So she said.

644
00:31:49,637 --> 00:31:51,571
I asked her if he was there.

645
00:31:51,637 --> 00:31:53,170
She said she supposed so,

646
00:31:53,237 --> 00:31:56,270
but she never heard him,
never felt him,

647
00:31:56,337 --> 00:31:58,370
never sensed he was there.

648
00:31:58,437 --> 00:32:01,637
I didn't believe her at first.

649
00:32:01,704 --> 00:32:04,537
<i>I used to drop her off</i>
<i>a couple of blocks away.</i>

650
00:32:04,604 --> 00:32:06,938
<i>She'd let me use the car.</i>

651
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:11,137
<i>Then one night, I followed her.</i>

652
00:32:12,504 --> 00:32:14,737
She caught me
before she got there.

653
00:32:14,804 --> 00:32:16,737
She was furious.

654
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:20,871
We had a huge fight,
broke up.

655
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:23,237
I'd call her,
she wouldn't answer.

656
00:32:23,304 --> 00:32:27,070
I'd go over to her dorm,
she wouldn't let me in.

657
00:32:27,137 --> 00:32:29,871
That's when she got
the restraining order.

658
00:32:30,904 --> 00:32:34,704
I stayed away
for a month,

659
00:32:34,771 --> 00:32:37,504
but then I couldn't
take it any longer.

660
00:32:37,571 --> 00:32:39,070
I went over to her dorm.

661
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:42,038
( <i>chuckles lightly</i> )
Damn near busted the door down.

662
00:32:42,103 --> 00:32:43,904
Her roommate threatened
to call the cops,

663
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:46,237
but Amanda finally let me in.

664
00:32:46,304 --> 00:32:51,771
Roommate took off,
and we had another huge fight

665
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:56,038
and then, a huge cry...

666
00:32:56,103 --> 00:32:58,637
and then, we made love.

667
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:05,137
I told her I was going to find
a way to pay for school.

668
00:33:05,203 --> 00:33:08,337
I was going to do it.

669
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:11,437
She told me she loved me,
she missed me.

670
00:33:11,504 --> 00:33:13,103
She was going to quit.

671
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:19,038
She was going to find a way
to tell that guy that night.

672
00:33:19,103 --> 00:33:21,237
That was the last time
I saw her.

673
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,103
Next thing I know, they found
her car at that car wash.

674
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,137
My DNA was everywhere.

675
00:33:31,203 --> 00:33:35,470
It was inside the car,
inside her.

676
00:33:35,537 --> 00:33:40,103
I told them my story,
but no one believed me.

677
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:42,637
Ma'am?

678
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:44,470
What are you thinking?

679
00:33:44,537 --> 00:33:48,337
I was thinking, have you
ever met Kathleen Walsh?

680
00:33:48,404 --> 00:33:49,938
No, I don't think so.

681
00:33:50,004 --> 00:33:51,571
What does she look like?

682
00:33:53,604 --> 00:33:57,504
I'm thinking she looks a lot
like this guy's next victim.

683
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,570
ing is that
there's this man

684
00:34:02,637 --> 00:34:04,670
who likes to watch women sleep?

685
00:34:04,737 --> 00:34:07,137
I'm not going to even pretend
to know what he likes.

686
00:34:07,204 --> 00:34:09,071
SCANLON:
You think this
is the guy

687
00:34:09,137 --> 00:34:11,338
who's been sneaking into your
friend Kathleen's apartment?

688
00:34:11,404 --> 00:34:13,137
Well, she's not my friend,
but yes,

689
00:34:13,204 --> 00:34:15,104
what I'm saying is
I feel very strongly

690
00:34:15,171 --> 00:34:17,637
the man who's been watching
Kathleen is the same man

691
00:34:17,704 --> 00:34:19,971
who was watching Elkin's
girlfriend, Amanda,

692
00:34:20,037 --> 00:34:23,670
and very well may have been
responsible for her death.

693
00:34:23,737 --> 00:34:25,870
You know, when I was preparing
for Elkin's parole hearing,

694
00:34:25,937 --> 00:34:27,271
I remember reading
his statement.

695
00:34:27,338 --> 00:34:30,470
This crazy story about
his girlfriend having a job,

696
00:34:30,537 --> 00:34:33,338
only he didn't know where,
and he didn't know with whom.

697
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,537
I know, it sounds so bizarre.
Bizarre?

698
00:34:35,603 --> 00:34:38,804
( <i>chuckles</i> )
No, it aspires to "bizarre."

699
00:34:40,338 --> 00:34:42,204
Allison, this man's sperm

700
00:34:42,271 --> 00:34:44,137
was still inside her
when they found the body.

701
00:34:44,204 --> 00:34:45,704
Yeah, they made up
the night before.

702
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:46,837
He went by her dorm.

703
00:34:46,904 --> 00:34:48,470
Her roommate saw him.

704
00:34:48,537 --> 00:34:50,237
Precisely, he was in violation
of the restraining order

705
00:34:50,304 --> 00:34:51,503
she took out against him.

706
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,104
Not exactly the kind of thing
you want to put

707
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:55,770
in front of a judge
in hopes of reopening a case.

708
00:34:55,837 --> 00:34:57,603
What if we could catch him?

709
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,171
You lost me.

710
00:34:59,237 --> 00:35:01,404
Well, we know he likes Kathleen.

711
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,804
So what if we can remove
the visible police presence

712
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:04,971
outside the building--

713
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:08,438
the squad car,
the patrolman?

714
00:35:08,503 --> 00:35:10,837
Are you suggesting
that we use this woman as bait?

715
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:13,004
We might be able
to do it safely.

716
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:14,637
Wire the place up
so we could hear everything,

717
00:35:14,704 --> 00:35:16,271
hide a bunch of SWAT guys.

718
00:35:16,338 --> 00:35:19,171
We're already providing round-
the-clock police protection

719
00:35:19,237 --> 00:35:22,537
against an intruder
I'm not convinced even exists!

720
00:35:22,603 --> 00:35:25,171
Now we're talking about spending
more of the taxpayer's money

721
00:35:25,237 --> 00:35:27,338
to catch someone you think
<i>might</i> have committed

722
00:35:27,404 --> 00:35:28,904
a five-year-old murder,

723
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:30,537
for which we already have
someone in prison?

724
00:35:30,603 --> 00:35:33,204
Doesn't matter-- won't
work unless Kathleen Walsh

725
00:35:33,271 --> 00:35:35,137
agrees to stay in that apartment
without a police car

726
00:35:35,204 --> 00:35:38,271
standing watch
outside her building.

727
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:41,204
Which I'm guessing might
be a tough sell.

728
00:35:41,271 --> 00:35:43,737
Well, can't we
at least ask her?

729
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,104
It's 11 minutes past 8:00.

730
00:35:47,171 --> 00:35:48,770
She might not have
left for work yet.

731
00:35:48,837 --> 00:35:53,338
It's up to you.

732
00:35:58,104 --> 00:35:59,670
Hello.

733
00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:02,470
Ms. Walsh, this is
District Attorney Devalos.

734
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:05,204
I'm sorry to bother you
so early in the morning,

735
00:36:05,271 --> 00:36:07,338
but we think we may have
developed a significant lead

736
00:36:07,404 --> 00:36:09,503
in your case,
and I was wondering

737
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,804
if I might be able to
persuade you to let us

738
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,037
pull the police presence
in front of your building

739
00:36:14,104 --> 00:36:17,204
for several nights in hopes
of drawing the suspect out.

740
00:36:17,271 --> 00:36:20,071
Obviously, we would install
other safety measures.

741
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:22,271
Last night was the first
good night's sleep

742
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:23,837
I've had in months.

743
00:36:23,904 --> 00:36:26,371
I can't tell you what
it was like to get into bed

744
00:36:26,438 --> 00:36:28,438
and know I was alone.

745
00:36:28,503 --> 00:36:30,870
<i>Know</i> I was alone.

746
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,137
JOE:
Hey, where you going?

747
00:36:35,204 --> 00:36:36,603
I got to call Scanlon.

748
00:36:42,104 --> 00:36:43,737
Yeah.

749
00:36:43,804 --> 00:36:45,204
He's in the apartment.

750
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:46,637
Allison?

751
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,670
I don't know how he got
in there, but...

752
00:36:48,737 --> 00:36:50,404
Are you talking
about Kathleen Walsh's place?

753
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,338
I got a cop and a cop car

754
00:36:52,404 --> 00:36:54,004
sitting in front
of her building, trust me.

755
00:36:54,071 --> 00:36:56,271
I'm telling you,
he can get past them.

756
00:36:56,338 --> 00:36:58,338
We changed the locks
on every door,

757
00:36:58,404 --> 00:37:00,137
and checked the latches
on all her windows.

758
00:37:00,204 --> 00:37:01,637
It doesn't matter.

759
00:37:01,704 --> 00:37:04,503
Allison, what you're saying
doesn't make any sense.

760
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,670
Please! You have a man
right there.

761
00:37:06,737 --> 00:37:08,770
Can't you send him up?

762
00:37:08,837 --> 00:37:11,071
It's 2:00 in the morning,
Allison.

763
00:37:11,137 --> 00:37:12,537
Lee!

764
00:37:12,603 --> 00:37:14,371
All right,
I'll send someone up there.

765
00:37:14,438 --> 00:37:15,971
I'll call you right back.

766
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:23,237
I'm not sure how I feel
about you calling strange men

767
00:37:23,304 --> 00:37:24,737
at 2:00 in the morning.

768
00:37:24,804 --> 00:37:25,937
I'm worried, Joe.

769
00:37:26,004 --> 00:37:27,503
I got a bad feeling.

770
00:37:29,537 --> 00:37:32,904
That's good enough for me.

771
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:36,537
You were right about Edrick,
by the way.

772
00:37:36,603 --> 00:37:37,904
What do you mean?

773
00:37:37,971 --> 00:37:40,137
Did he fall to his knees,
beg for mercy?

774
00:37:40,204 --> 00:37:42,271
Pretty damn close.

775
00:37:44,537 --> 00:37:45,904
Hey.

776
00:37:45,971 --> 00:37:47,237
Two officers went up, Allison.

777
00:37:47,304 --> 00:37:48,670
They checked the whole place.

778
00:37:48,737 --> 00:37:51,137
No one was in there,
and no one was getting in there,

779
00:37:51,204 --> 00:37:53,503
I mean, except for one fairly
cheesed-off blind lady,

780
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,570
who said she was enjoying
the best night's sleep

781
00:37:55,637 --> 00:37:56,804
she'd had in months.

782
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,204
Really?

783
00:37:58,271 --> 00:38:00,371
But I don't understand.

784
00:38:00,438 --> 00:38:02,770
No offense, Allison,
but it's 2:00 in the morning.
( <i>sighs</i> )

785
00:38:02,837 --> 00:38:06,137
You, me, and Devalos are
supposed to meet at 8:00 a.m.

786
00:38:06,204 --> 00:38:08,438
Would it be okay
if we chatted then?

787
00:38:08,503 --> 00:38:11,570
Sure.

788
00:38:11,637 --> 00:38:14,603
Now you're suggesting
we use this woman as bait?

789
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:19,603
Well, we know he likes Kathleen,
so maybe we could remove

790
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,071
some of the visible police
presence around the building--

791
00:38:22,137 --> 00:38:25,204
the car sitting there,
the patrolman?

792
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,837
Okay...

793
00:38:31,904 --> 00:38:33,603
What do you want me to say?

794
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,837
Well, I don't know.

795
00:38:35,904 --> 00:38:37,770
Last night, I convinced myself

796
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:40,770
that you thought
it was a good idea.

797
00:38:40,837 --> 00:38:43,371
Well... I don't know
what to tell you.

798
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:46,104
Allison, be realistic.

799
00:38:46,171 --> 00:38:48,570
After you convinced
Detective Scanlon

800
00:38:48,637 --> 00:38:50,971
to send the police charging
into this woman's apartment

801
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,804
at 2:00 in the morning, the
other tenants in the building,

802
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,338
who are already up in arms
about being stopped

803
00:38:56,404 --> 00:38:59,537
every time they come in and go
out, have had it up to here.

804
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,037
Not to mention what it's
costing the department

805
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:03,071
keeping personnel there 24-7.

806
00:39:03,137 --> 00:39:04,737
I think we have to pull
the plug on this thing.

807
00:39:04,804 --> 00:39:06,537
But, sir, that
man was there!

808
00:39:06,603 --> 00:39:08,237
I saw him--
we were here

809
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,371
having a meeting like this...

810
00:39:09,438 --> 00:39:10,704
Allison...

811
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:14,438
I have enormous respect for you,
but it's 8:10,

812
00:39:14,503 --> 00:39:15,804
and I'm due
in the judge's chambers

813
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,037
in 20 minutes.

814
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,371
8:10?

815
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:25,037
Last night,
you said it was 8:11.

816
00:39:25,104 --> 00:39:26,870
Last night?
What are you talking about?

817
00:39:31,171 --> 00:39:36,004
Hey, I need to use your phone.

818
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:39,537
Hello.

819
00:39:39,603 --> 00:39:41,438
Kathleen, it's Allison.

820
00:39:41,503 --> 00:39:42,637
Are you standing
in your kitchen

821
00:39:42,704 --> 00:39:43,704
wearing your bathrobe

822
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,503
holding a cup
of hot coffee?

823
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,237
Well, no.

824
00:39:47,304 --> 00:39:49,137
Now I'm making my way
into the living room,

825
00:39:49,204 --> 00:39:52,371
wearing my bathrobe,
holding a cup of hot coffee.

826
00:39:52,438 --> 00:39:54,071
Kathleen, I need you
to stay calm

827
00:39:54,137 --> 00:39:56,004
and do exactly
as I say.

828
00:39:57,137 --> 00:39:58,870
Take that hot coffee
you're holding

829
00:39:58,937 --> 00:40:00,171
and throw it over
your right shoulder.

830
00:40:00,237 --> 00:40:01,603
This is Detective Scanlon.

831
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,104
I need you to
get up there now.

832
00:40:03,171 --> 00:40:05,404
Enter Kathleen Walsh's
apartment, weapons drawn.

833
00:40:08,537 --> 00:40:11,137
Kathleen, do it now--
he's right behind you!

834
00:40:13,171 --> 00:40:16,137
( <i>laughing</i> ):
Mom, don't be ridiculous.

835
00:40:28,204 --> 00:40:30,137
No!

836
00:40:35,004 --> 00:40:36,137
Police! Release that woman,

837
00:40:36,204 --> 00:40:37,237
and put your
hands in the air!

838
00:40:48,204 --> 00:40:52,503
DEVALOS:
I want to thank you
for your bravery.

839
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,438
And I would also
like to apologize

840
00:40:54,503 --> 00:40:56,770
for the initial skepticism
that came from this office.

841
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:58,404
Apology accepted.

842
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,438
Turns out your tormentor

843
00:41:00,503 --> 00:41:02,503
was also your neighbor.

844
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,371
It seems your apartment and his
were originally designed

845
00:41:05,438 --> 00:41:06,937
as a single unit.

846
00:41:07,004 --> 00:41:09,603
Mr. Christopher Russo
and his mother lived there

847
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,770
until the early '90s,
when his mother passed on,

848
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:14,603
and he decided to turn it
into two apartments.

849
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,137
Your living room closet
shares a common wall

850
00:41:16,204 --> 00:41:17,570
with one in his bedroom.

851
00:41:17,637 --> 00:41:19,570
SCANLON:
He finally confessed
to everything last night

852
00:41:19,637 --> 00:41:20,971
from his hospital bed.

853
00:41:21,037 --> 00:41:22,737
He hired Amanda Crane
five years ago.

854
00:41:22,804 --> 00:41:24,937
When she told him
that the arrangement

855
00:41:25,004 --> 00:41:26,971
no longer worked for her,

856
00:41:27,037 --> 00:41:29,171
he told her he had
pictures of her.

857
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,204
She threatened to
call the police.

858
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:33,037
They fought; he
strangled her.

859
00:41:33,104 --> 00:41:35,171
He claims to have been
so horrified by the act

860
00:41:35,237 --> 00:41:36,837
of killing Amanda,
that he completely swore off

861
00:41:36,904 --> 00:41:40,171
having anything to do
with the opposite sex.

862
00:41:40,237 --> 00:41:42,304
Started renting the apartment

863
00:41:42,371 --> 00:41:44,704
and completely forgot
about the common closet.

864
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:47,404
Then, you came along,
a beautiful tenant

865
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,137
with a built-in blindfold,

866
00:41:49,204 --> 00:41:51,837
and his old compulsions
just took over.

867
00:41:51,904 --> 00:41:54,704
Well, I'm just happy to know
he's behind bars.

868
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,637
Which reminds me,
there is someone

869
00:41:56,704 --> 00:41:59,438
who would very much
like to meet you.

870
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:12,737
ALLISON:
Kathleen.

871
00:42:12,804 --> 00:42:15,104
This is Sam Elkin.

872
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:17,338
It's very nice to meet you.

873
00:42:18,371 --> 00:42:20,737
Nice to meet you, Sam.

874
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:24,171
I've never slept

875
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:27,104
with an executive senior
vice president before.

876
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:31,271
Five extra vacation
days a year.

877
00:42:31,338 --> 00:42:33,870
Very impressive.

878
00:42:33,937 --> 00:42:38,404
So what did Edrick
have to say about it?

879
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,304
He was upset, but
I explained to him,

880
00:42:45,371 --> 00:42:47,304
with age comes
experience,

With any luck...
