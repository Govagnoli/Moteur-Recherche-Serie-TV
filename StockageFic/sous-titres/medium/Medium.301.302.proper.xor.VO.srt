1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,330
I have a theory.alma

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,560
We all eat.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,260
We all sleep.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,530
We all dream.

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,530
WOMAN:
Manuel?

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,860
Can you hear me?

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,880
Manuel wake up
Huh?

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,080
What?
What are you doing?

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,910
What, what, what are...
what are you talking about?

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,350
Geez, Manny,
are you all right?

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,980
What do you mean?

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,950
You wet the bed.

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,910
Our dreams reveal us
to ourselves.

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,050
The people we are.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,650
Don't just shoot,
you gotta aim it.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,810
So when that site is in
the middle of the clown's mouth,

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,250
then you shoot.
Okay, Daddy.

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,980
The people we'd like to be.

19
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,350
Whoo! Yeah!

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,180
You don't need much.

21
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,350
Just a little push.

22
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,850
Oh, hole in two!

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,880
Hey!

24
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,510
Ah, come on, boy!

25
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,110
You guys have fun?

26
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,010
Oh... sure did.

27
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,010
(grunting):
All right.

28
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,610
Here's your deposit.

29
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,080
A lot of people tell me
the game's even more fun

30
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,250
when they bring their own kid,
rather than renting one.

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,210
I know. I heard that.

32
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,410
You know how
to get one?

33
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,250
I know people.

34
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,980
(grunting):
Yeah.

35
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,150
(sighing):
Wait a second, will you?

36
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,680
What are you talking about--

37
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,110
"heads blown off"?

38
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,080
Mm... do me a favor,
look around.

39
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,150
Sometimes... a kid will hide
under the bed, in a closet.

40
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,150
All dead.

41
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,750
No, I have no idea
where the mayor is.

42
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,050
It's 5:52 in the morning.

43
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,580
I'm guessing
that he's at home, asleep.

44
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,650
Wait a second,
give me an address.

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,680
How many children?

46
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,350
No, don't move anything,
just lock it down.

47
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,110
I'm maybe 35 minutes away.

48
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,550
I'll be right down there.

49
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,110
Some people have dreams
that amaze them...

50
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,450
...and entertain them.

51
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,010
And then there are my dreams.

52
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,770
Where is your head?

53
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,620
You keep staring at the ceiling
like your mind is somewhere else.

54
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,760
Like your mind is on someone else.

55
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:56,130
It's rude to pay a woman for her attention

56
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,320
and then not give her any.

57
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,640
MAN:
Speak English.

58
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,010
You want English?

59
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,640
Why'd you come to Indonesia?

60
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,940
Go home to America.

61
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,310
Where are you going?

62
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,440
I'm going
to the airport.

63
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,840
I'm going home.

64
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,770
(scoffs)
I feel
like going home.

65
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,770
You can't do that.

66
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,910
You're intoxicated.

67
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,170
Do you even have a ticket?

68
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,740
Besides...
it's early in the morning.

69
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,770
It's not time for traveling.

70
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,640
It's time to make love.

71
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,340
Keep the change.

72
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,370
What's the matter?

73
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,040
What's going on?

74
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,770
A dream?
Ugh, yeah.

75
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,340
You want to talk
about it?

76
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,670
I don't know.

77
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:35,010
I'm not sure there's anything
to talk about.

78
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,740
Oh, wow.

79
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,310
Well, that's a first.

80
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,140
I mean,
it took place in Indonesia.

81
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,810
I don't know anyone
in Indonesia.

82
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,540
You would've
liked it, though.

83
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,410
There was a naked
girl in it.

84
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,340
This is weird.

85
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,140
I just had the
exact same dream.

86
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,240
Oh, really.

87
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,570
Truly.

88
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,740
Was there a guy in your dream
who got his head chopped off?

89
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,570
No.

90
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,510
I just had the
naked girl part.

91
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,740
I see.

92
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,210
You had a guy...

93
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,170
Well, I hope you're happy.

94
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,940
Now I'm afraid to
go back to sleep

95
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,110
and finish the dream.

96
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,870
Yeah, well,
welcome to my world.

100
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,970
BRIDGETTE:
I have a sore throat.

101
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,610
What are you
talking about?

102
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,510
Don't make me
say it again.

103
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,940
It really hurts.

104
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,070
Come here, Bridge.

105
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,970
Let's have a
look at you.
No, don't, Daddy.

106
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,910
(giggling loudly):
Hey, hey!

107
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,370
Oh, what do you know?

108
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,940
All cured.

109
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,210
No, wait.

110
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,640
That was my tickle throat,
not my talking throat.

111
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,070
(chuckles)
Well, you can use

112
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,340
your tickle throat
in school today.

113
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,340
No one will know
the difference.

114
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,510
Bridge...
Hmm?

115
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,640
You want to tell me
what this is all about?

116
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,370
No, you'll just
think it's stupid.

117
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,670
Well, maybe, maybe not.

118
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,510
Well, I had the funnest
dream last night,

119
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,870
and I was sort of hoping

120
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,510
that I could stay in bed
and have it again today.

121
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,870
What kind of dream?

122
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,870
It was a cartoon
with monkeys in it.

123
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,410
BRIDGETTE:
Oh, no.

124
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,210
Hello?

125
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,070
If I swing by your house
in 20 minutes,

126
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,910
could you join me for a
little trip to Paradise Valley?

127
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,410
Uh, hang on a second.

128
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,110
I have to ask my husband if he
can run the girls to school.

129
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,910
Yes, I can run the
girls to school.

130
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,710
And don't worry, Bridge,
if you start feeling

131
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,660
a little feverish, I'll
just tickle you some more.

132
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,360
Not funny, Daddy.

133
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,420
Not...
Whoa!

134
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,060
funny... Daddy.
(giggling)

135
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,760
Not funny.

136
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,320
So what are we
rushing off to see?

137
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,390
Well, I can't seem to get a
straight answer on that one.

138
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,660
I asked Detective Scanlon if
he thought it might be useful

139
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,190
to have you on the scene,

140
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,220
and he indicated that it
certainly couldn't hurt.

141
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,760
You seem awfully thirsty.

142
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,360
You okay?

143
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,990
It's the heat.

144
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,160
You'd think, after all these
years, a body would adjust.

145
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,220
REPORTER:
But I don't understand.

146
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,690
Why are we not being told
the exact nature of the crime?

147
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,970
DINOVI:
You're not being told
the exact nature

148
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,010
of the crime because the
investigation is ongoing

149
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,070
and has not yet reached a stage

150
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,470
where we can make
that determination.

151
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,810
REPORTER 2:
Where is the mayor?

152
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,040
We're hearing rumors
of a cult-like slaughter,

153
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,270
a Manson-style killing spree.

154
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,910
Shouldn't the mayor be here?

155
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,240
I spoke with the mayor
early this morning.

156
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,670
He's rushing back
from a fact-finding mission.

157
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,940
I'm sure he'll have plenty
to say when he gets here.

158
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,240
Sorry, folks.

159
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,140
I'm afraid that's all
I have for now.

160
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,010
Thank you.

161
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,340
Thanks.

162
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,740
Fact finding mission?

163
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,270
That's what
his girlfriend said.

164
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,210
A Las Vegas
fact finding mission.

165
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,670
Apparently, that's where
all the best facts are found.

166
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,810
Okay.

167
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,870
My interest is piqued.

168
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,470
What exactly are we
looking at here, Lee?

169
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,010
Not exactly sure yet.

170
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,110
Wealthy family-- mother,
father, three kids.

171
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,640
Live-in help had
the weekend off.

172
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,910
Housekeeper
lets herself in

173
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,670
at 5:00 a.m., discovers
all of them shot to death.

174
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,270
Was it a robbery?

175
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,240
Maid says
nothing's missing.

176
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,770
Family attorney's
on his way over

177
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,510
with a locksmith
to look in the vault,

178
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,510
but our guys are telling
me it hasn't been touched.

179
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,740
Put your party clothes on,
I'll show you what we got.

180
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,140
SCANLON:
We're guessing
the wife here

181
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,140
heard the shots
from the family room

182
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,210
and was standing, attempting
to get out of the tub

183
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,210
when her attacker came

184
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,470
to this doorway.

185
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,110
There was no weapon present
when the first team

186
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,210
of responding officers
showed up this morning.

187
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,070
Doesn't appear to be
a murder-suicide.

188
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,170
TV REPORTER:
Now for more on
the market sell-off...

189
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,940
Honey?

190
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,770
TV REPORTER:
...early warning
stock predicting...

191
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,110
The kids were all
shot in their beds.

192
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,940
Dog's in here, too.

193
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,440
DEVALOS:
Allison?

194
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,640
Yeah, I know, the kids.

195
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,370
I'll take your word for it.

196
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,040
We need to find out
everything we can

197
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,270
about the man
of the house.

198
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,210
Maybe... it's
a revenge killing.

199
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,110
Pretty savage
form of revenge.

200
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,470
Maybe the attorney will open

201
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,210
the safe and tell us
the family jewels are missing.

202
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,970
Sorry, guys, but I seriously
doubt this was a robbery.

203
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,870
Why do you say that?

204
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,140
That's an Armand Vartanian,

205
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,270
probably worth three quarters

206
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,010
of a million dollars.

207
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,740
I mean, if you're looking
for something of value.

208
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,010
I'm gonna visit
the powder room,

209
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,870
then we'll be
on our way.

210
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,540
See you in about an hour.

211
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,740
Can I help you?

212
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,570
I don't know.

213
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,640
I'm gonna call the police.

214
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,840
If you need help,
they can help you.

215
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,310
What?

216
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,510
I would really appreciate it

217
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,410
if you could just wait
for them the sidewalk.

218
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,540
This your house?

219
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,370
Phoenix Police, this
is Allison Dubois

220
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,940
with the District
Attorney's office.

221
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,940
Phoenix?

222
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,840
I'm in Phoenix?
I made the plane?

223
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,440
I have a man here
standing on my front porch.

224
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,110
No, you don't.

225
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,370
No, no, you don't.

226
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,610
I don't know who he is.

227
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,010
He didn't identify himself.

228
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,740
Oh, that's not true.
That's not true.

229
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,010
My name's Clay Bicks.

230
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,810
Clay Bicks.

231
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,110
Oh, my God.

232
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,070
(chuckles):
Hey...

233
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,940
Clay.

234
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,070
You cut your hair.

235
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,610
What'd you say
your last name was?

236
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,310
Dubois.

237
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,510
Benoit.

238
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,610
Allison Benoit.

239
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,770
Al.

240
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,260
Cut your hair, too.

241
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,240
Come here, you.

242
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,870
No, no, back up, back up.

243
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,170
I, uh... it's been awhile
between showers, you know?

244
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,940
I still can't believe

245
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,010
they let me on the plane.

246
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,170
God, you look great.

247
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,770
Plane from where?

248
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,040
Indonesia.

249
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,870
Indonesia.

250
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,440
Yeah, I'm a shooter--
photographer.

251
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,870
You know, magazines,
wire services.

252
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,340
Sounds dangerous.

253
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,540
I know.

254
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,310
I get a little anxious
just talking about it.

255
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,140
What kind of idiot
goes over there,

256
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,640
seeks work like that, huh?

257
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,670
They do have
a couple of

258
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,070
excellent bars, though.

259
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,740
Damn, you look, uh... great.

260
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,710
You look different.

261
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,070
And how dare you change
when I wasn't looking?

262
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,610
Well, it's a long time
since high school, Clay.

263
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,170
Yeah... You got
kids now, huh?

264
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,410
Mm-hmm.

265
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,970
Yeah... Why'd you go
do that without me?

266
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,410
What, just 'cause you ain't
seen me in 17, 18 years?

267
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,570
Bet you're
married now, huh?

268
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,870
Happy, well-adjusted.

269
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,710
Bet you never get
stinking drunk.

270
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,040
Bet you bathe every day.

271
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,220
You know...

272
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,460
I got a weird confession
to make.

273
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,890
I been in a couple
of hairy spots in my life.

274
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,490
Stared down a couple of
loaded barrels,

275
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,320
had a couple of
scary helicopter rides.

276
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,920
Got taken hostage once
for three days in Samoa.

277
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,760
And you know that moment when
you're thinking, "This is it."

278
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,620
You know,
the Clay Bicks Show is over.

279
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,160
You know who'd keep
popping in my head?

280
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,460
You.

281
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,520
Ms. Benoit.

282
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,090
Voted most likely
to stay in someone's head

283
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,790
long after they've let them go.

284
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
Maybe they shouldn't have.

285
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,520
You're my favorite regret.

286
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,220
You don't remember
getting on the plane?

287
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,160
Nah, I was pretty loaded.

288
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,020
And you don't remember
getting off here in Phoenix?

289
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,920
Why don't you come in the house?

290
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,720
We'll have a cup
of coffee, and...

291
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,960
mom this is......???

292
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,710
and ????

293
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,020
so...????

294
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,670
you know.do???

295
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,420
5

296
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,090
Just...
I'll be there in a second.

297
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,070
BRIDGETTE:
Are we having dinner yet?

298
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,840
ARIEL: Uh, what are you
talking about?

299
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,500
Daddy's not even home yet.
And it's, like, 5:30.

300
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,000
And why are you
in your pajamas?

301
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,440
Well, as soon
as dinner's over,

302
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,770
I want to go
right to bed.

303
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,770
Why?
I had the funnest
dream last night.

304
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,070
It was a cartoon
called The Monkeyheads,

305
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,640
and I can't wait
to see more of it.

306
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,640
TheMonkeyheads?!

307
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,470
That's so over.

308
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,300
That was on when
I was little.

309
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,470
BRIDGETTE:
So? I don't care.

310
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,870
I still like it.

311
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,770
DEVALOS:
Yeah... my whole
morning's open.

312
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,470
Just set the appointment,
e-mail me the time.

313
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,970
Right. I'm home now.

314
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,900
Just e-mail me the time.

315
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,870
Okay.

316
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,240
Whew... Damn.

317
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,140
There are just some
days that can't end

318
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,640
fast enough.

319
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,500
Mmm! Smells good.

320
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,540
Smells good.

321
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,740
Call them back
and tell them

322
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,770
you're not free
tomorrow morning.

323
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,770
I called Dr. Berman.

324
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,240
He remembered you.

325
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,900
I made an appointment
for 10:30.

326
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,640
I'll drive you.

327
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,870
I'm a grown man.

328
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,840
I can make my own
doctor's appointments,

329
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,870
thank you very much.

330
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,470
There's something
wrong, Manuel.

331
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,940
I'm worried you're
falling apart inside.

332
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,540
Sometimes, I wake up
in the morning,

333
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,770
and you're laying
there and I...

334
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,340
I think you're dead.

335
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,800
I can't hear you breathe,
you're covered in sweat,

336
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,100
you're white as a ghost.

337
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,570
I'm fine.

338
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,240
It's Phoenix-- it's
hot and I sweat.

339
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,740
Tomorrow, I will
find a doctor.

340
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,470
I will call and I will
make an appointment.

341
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,540
And when the time comes,
I'll drive myself.

342
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,670
Right now, I'm hungry,
and I'm, uh...

343
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,670
gonna eat.

344
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,940
How do you think
he knew where you lived?

345
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,750
I have no idea.

346
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,820
How do you think
he knew you'd be home?

347
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,220
I have no idea.

348
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,490
What do you think he wanted?

349
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,050
(sighs):
I have no idea.

350
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,790
I think maybe
I'm a little jealous.

351
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,720
He's dead, Joe.

352
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,050
Well, you know,
in some ways,

353
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,090
that could give him
an unfair advantage.

354
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,050
I don't think
he knows he's dead.

355
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,720
What? You trying to get me
to feel sorry for him?

356
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,820
I think maybe

357
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,420
that's why he's here.

358
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,490
Maybe that's why
he's waiting for me.

359
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,890
I think maybe
I'm supposed to tell him.

360
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,190
You don't think
he'll get the gist

361
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,290
when he looks in the mirror
and there's nobody there?

362
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,390
When the phone
stops ringing?

363
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,690
When nobody bothers
to check his theater stub

364
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,850
after he comes back
from the candy counter?

365
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,600
I think they've
got a pretty good

366
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,700
orientation system
already in place.

367
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,270
Then why did I have
that encounter?

368
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,640
And why was he brought here?

369
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,570
I don't know, he needed
the extra frequent flier miles,

370
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,840
figured an extra stopover?

371
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,870
I believe these things

372
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,140
happen to me for a reason.

373
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,840
The challenge is
to have the patience

374
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,540
to wait for the reason
to reveal itself.

375
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,470
Hmm... profundity.

376
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,370
If I dig it out, will you write
that in my high school yearbook?

377
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,470
(singsong):
Someone is jealous.

378
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,240
Of your high school boyfriend?
I think not.

379
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,440
He was pretty wild.

380
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,500
I was pretty wild.

381
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,670
Well, he's not wild now.

382
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,040
I'm sorry.

383
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,920
I've really had
my fill of death today.

384
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,420
I really have.

385
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,300
Deputy Mayor DiNovi.
I'll tell you what I know.

386
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,170
The Costigans all died
early this morning

387
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,500
of close-range shotgun wounds.

388
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,500
Preliminary investigations
suggest that the killings

389
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,240
were not related to
Mr. Costigan's employment.

390
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,000
We are aware of
similar home invasions

391
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,870
in Wyoming and New Mexico

392
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,740
during the last 12 months.

393
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,940
Beyond that,
it's an active investigation.

394
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,370
Hopefully, we'll know
more in the morning.

395
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,800
WOMAN:
Do you have
anything to say

396
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,270
to the people of Phoenix
who are obviously frightened?

397
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,140
Phoenix is a safe city.

398
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,540
But obviously, people need
to take precautions.

399
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,570
Lock your doors,
lock your windows.

400
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,840
Check in on your loved ones,

401
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,740
check in on your neighbors,

402
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:01,800
and know that we are
gonna find these people.

403
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
We're gonna stop these people.

404
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,740
REPORTER:
And what does the mayor have
to say about all this?

405
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,170
DINOVI:
The mayor fell ill
prior to boarding a plane

406
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
back to Phoenix this morning.

407
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,200
(phone ringing)

408
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,670
Hey.

409
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,370
Yeah, I saw it;
of course I saw it.

410
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,040
You were great.

411
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,900
You couldn't hear me cheering
from over here?

412
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,540
You coming over?

413
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,300
I don't care.

414
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,570
Ring the bell, wake me up.

415
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,570
I mean it.

416
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,640
2:00 in the morning.
Whenever.

417
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,740
Wake me up.

418
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,600
It was so random.

419
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,700
They were so unprepared.

420
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,340
I mean, in his wildest dreams,
could he have ever imagined

421
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:07,400
that he would have died
lying on his belly...

422
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,340
reading the paper?

423
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,440
And the mom.

424
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,470
Was she singing in the shower,
seconds before it happened?

425
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,770
And the kids.

426
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,040
What were they dreaming about

427
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,500
before their lives
were snuffed out?

428
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,270
Are you sure
everything's locked?

429
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,170
I'll go check again.

430
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,170
Mom?

431
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,500
Mom?!

432
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,940
Mom...!

433
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,900
Mom, please!

434
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,900
Mom!

435
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,300
Help!

436
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,900
BRIDGETTE:
Mommy...

437
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,170
I just had a bad dream.

438
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,140
Yeah, me, too.

439
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,100
You know you don't have
to go to bed early

440
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,940
to see The Monkeyheads,
they're all out on DVD.

441
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,070
Well, I don't care!

442
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,570
I hate The Monkeyheads!

443
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,100
Somebody had
a nightmare last night.

444
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,400
So that's what you were doing
in our bed

445
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,600
this morning.
Well, Monkeyheads are scary.

446
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,740
Monkeyheads aren't scary,
they're just stupid.

447
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,200
You're stupid!

448
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,340
Nobody's stupid.

449
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,370
Marie, baby, we're all out

450
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,070
of Nutty Wutteys.
How about

451
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,440
some flakes?

452
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,470
We have millions of kinds
of flakes.

453
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,300
I want some eggs!

454
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,970
Did you see this?

455
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,240
How do you feel about frying
your daughter some eggs,

456
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,270
so I could sit down

457
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,900
and have myself
a cup of...
Oh, sure.

458
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,740
I'm done.
I'm done.

459
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,000
Daddy's making you eggs.

460
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,140
Thanks, Daddy.

461
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,100
So, I know that Bridgette
had a nightmare.

462
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,340
Tell me about your nightlife.

463
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,840
Any visits from old boyfriends?

464
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,070
No.

465
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,340
I suppose he figured out
where he was supposed to be,

466
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,970
and how to get there,
all by himself.

467
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,540
What do you mean?
Are you telling me

468
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,970
that you actually had
a sound night's sleep?

469
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,670
I didn't say that;
I just didn't see

470
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,000
any news you can use,
if you know what I mean.

471
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,800
Nothing about Clay,

472
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,600
nothing about this.

473
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,300
I did have a terryfying dream
about a little  b-o-y.

474
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,540
That took place I
don't know where,

475
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,500
I don't know when,
involving I don't know who.

476
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,640
Isn't that what you said

477
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,940
about your Indonesian nightmare?

478
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,370
I mean, before you realized who
and what it was really about.

479
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,840
Well, that's what has me
so worried.

480
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,870
Oh, Lee.

481
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,780
Can I talk to you
about something?

482
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,450
I don't know if it
means anything but...

483
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,920
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

484
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,620
You mind taking a ride,
we'll talk in the car?
Sure.

485
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,650
What's going on?

486
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,820
Some hikers spotted a
minivan, sitting upside-down

487
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:05,440
in a couple feet of water.
?????es in it.

488
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,470
There are.

489
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,840
A mother and her son.

490
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,700
Okay.

491
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,440
And you wanted to
talk to me about...?

492
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,470
We just covered it.

493
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,740
Someone slept alone
last night.

494
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,140
You really are psychic.

495
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,500
Ha, ha.

496
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,270
Shaving cream.
Yeah, clever.

497
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,970
No woman would let a man
leave home like that.

498
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,700
Yeah, well, wasn't
for lack of trying.

499
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,740
She's just been working
all hours.

500
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,070
Between this home invasion thing
and the mayor

501
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,470
flaking out.

502
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,800
Hm.

503
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,520
How old were you
when you got married?

504
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,620
Me? Um... nine.

505
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,420
I've been married 12 years.

506
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,920
So, yeah, nine, mm-hmm.

507
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,290
Yeah, well, I'm
pushing 14 myself.

508
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,650
You know, I never really
lived with anyone.

509
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,320
Not long-term.

510
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,150
Hey, if it works for you.

511
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,790
Yeah, well, I'm not so sure
it does anymore.

512
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,320
Tough to make the leap.

513
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,970
But I'm thinking there might be
some leaping in my future.

514
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,140
Well, go on, Baryshnikov.

515
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,420
You can see where the big SUV
pushed against it,

516
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,590
forced it off the road.

517
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,050
Maybe.

518
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,070
It's just so eerie.

519
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,840
Everything I dreamt about
happened.

520
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,400
Well, that has to give you
some sense of satisfaction.

521
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,870
No, it doesn't.

522
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,300
I feel like
a walking carnival trick.

523
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,400
I dreamt about this little boy
drowning to death.

524
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,540
What do you know?

525
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,870
It really happened.

526
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,100
What is the point?

527
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,840
Why show it to me
if I can't prevent it?

528
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,700
So I have answers
for the police questions

529
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,100
15 minutes before they
would have them otherwise?

530
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,840
You know, um,

531
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,500
a very intuitive lady
once said to me...

532
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,340
"I believe these things happen
to me for a reason,

533
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,100
"and the challenge is having
the patience

534
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,500
to wait for the reason
to reveal itself."

535
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,000
Oh, zip it.

536
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,800
Anyway, I called Mrs.
Pasternack down the street.

537
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,500
She's going to take the girls
home with her.

538
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,100
So if you could stop by
her place on the way home...

539
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,770
Thy will be done.

540
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,100
CRIME TECH:
Everything we can do
here, we've done.

541
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,240
The rest of it

542
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,940
really ought to happen
back at the lab.

543
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,000
I made a call-- flatbed's
on its way out here.

544
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,700
Anything you want to share?

545
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,900
Well, wherever
they were going,

546
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,500
they knew it was going to
take them a while to get there.

547
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,940
Car's full of clothes,
toiletries...

548
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,070
No maps, though.

549
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,070
No tickets or brochures.

550
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,170
You get the feeling that maybe

551
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,440
it was
a pretty spontaneous trip.

552
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,500
But you got a lot of
the kinds of things

553
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,100
you see on a long road trip,
like DVDs for the kid,

554
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,370
fast food wrappers,
juice boxes...

555
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,340
What's this?
It was in the player.

556
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,970
They must've had it on

557
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,740
when they went over the side--
The MonkeyHeads.

558
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:27,000
Did you say Monkeyheads?

559
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,300
Mm-hmm.

560
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,200
SCANLON:
What's the big deal?

561
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,500
Does that mean something?

562
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,510
(gasping):
Oh, boy...

563
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,510
1

564
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,250
Hey, I'm home.

565
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,850
Shh, shh, shh.
You'll wake the baby.

566
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,340
Marie's already down?

567
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,570
Have you looked
at your watch?

568
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,240
It's after 9:00.

569
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,770
Wow.
You do good work.

570
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,070
What about Bridgette?

571
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,570
I really need to
talk to Bridgette.

572
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,700
Well, I don't know,

573
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,340
she's been in bed
for half an hour,

574
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,440
but I couldn't tell you
if she's asleep or not,

575
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,340
'cause she fought me
every step of the way.

576
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,400
Three days ago, she couldn't
wait to get to bed,

577
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,470
and now she acts like

578
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,100
I'm sending her off
to the electric chair.

579
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,500
You going to have
some food?

580
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,400
Later.
(sighs)

581
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,400
Did you feel that?

582
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,540
What?

583
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,940
That blast of cold air?

584
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:19,100
What are you talking about?

585
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,240
I don't even think
the air-conditioning's on.

586
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:22,440
I don't know.

587
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,870
I've been
feeling them all night.

588
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,600
Maybe it's just my imagination.

589
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,770
Maybe you're going through
the change of life.

590
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,300
Ah, could be.

591
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,270
(whispering):
Bridgette.

592
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,900
Bridgette?

593
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,970
Hey. Hey.

594
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,870
(gently):
Hey...

595
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,470
What are you doing
with this?

596
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,000
This is your sister's.

597
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,640
Well, I wasn't hurting it.

598
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,500
I was just listening to it.

599
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,370
Well, you're not supposed
to be listening to it,

600
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,270
you're supposed
to be asleep.

601
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,100
Well, I don't want to be asleep.

602
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,840
Sleeping is scary.

603
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,100
I seeMonkeyheads
when I sleep.

604
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,940
And why is that scary?

605
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,040
Monkeyheads aren't scary.
Monkeyheads are funny.

606
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,140
No, no, they're not.
Not lately.

607
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,370
Really?

608
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,140
Tell me what you've seen.

609
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,640
Well, the other night,

610
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,340
this mama monkey
and this baby monkey,

611
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,470
they were in their car,

612
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,870
and then these bad monkeys
chased them

613
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,700
and chased them

614
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,870
and then pushed them right off
the road and into this lake.

615
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,640
And then?

616
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,240
And then they just sat there,

617
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,000
and they were upside-down,
and they were bleeding,

618
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,240
and the car got filled
up all with water.

619
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,800
And they just sat there.

620
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,540
And then they were breathing
funny little cartoon bubbles.

621
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,740
And then they
finally fell asleep,

622
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,970
and turned into Angel Monkeys,

623
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,840
and floated out the car
and up to heaven.

624
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,540
Sweetie...

625
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,440
Well, I can see why
you wouldn't want to have

626
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:03,140
another dream like that.

627
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,400
But here's
the thing, Bridge--

628
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,140
I am almost 100% sure

629
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,970
that the bad dreams are over.

630
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,340
I really think it's okay
to go back to sleep.

631
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,440
You do?
I do.

632
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,700
And if, for some strange reason,
I'm wrong,

633
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,840
you can come into my bed.

634
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:25,840
But... I don't think I'm wrong.

635
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,770
I think the bad dream
is over.

636
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,470
Well, I hope so.

637
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,970
'Cause it's really tiring
trying not to sleep.

638
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,640
She dreamt it, too.

639
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,200
The little boy,
the drowning.

640
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,740
What are you
talking about?

641
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,100
She dreamt a cartoon version
of the same thing I did.

642
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,970
Cartoon?

643
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,940
Why a cartoon?

644
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,440
The little boy

645
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,300
was watching cartoons
when he drowned.

646
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,240
I suppose he was trying to make
peace with the way he died,

647
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,100
trying to find someone
to tell his story to.

648
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,040
They're about
the same age.

649
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,470
I hate that she dreams
that stuff.

650
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,900
I know.

651
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,270
For what it's worth,
I think she's okay.

652
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,570
She really thinks
it is a cartoon.

653
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,740
A scary cartoon,
but still a cartoon.

654
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,470
And I do think it's over.

655
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,770
Oh...

656
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,270
God.

657
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,940
Tell me you don't feel that.

658
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,570
Feel what?

659
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,940
It's like arctic.

660
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,070
You didn't feel
that cold blast of air?

661
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,040
Come here, let me
feel your head.

662
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,540
You don't feel feverish.

663
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,100
But why don't you go
lay down in bed?

664
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,540
I'll be in in a minute.

665
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,740
I don't feel sick.

666
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,570
I don't know what to tell you.

667
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,170
It's Phoenix, Arizona.

668
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,740
If you're feeling the chills,
you're getting sick.

669
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,070
Just go.

670
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,940
I'll clean up.
I'll lock up.

671
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,840
Hey, Al.

672
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,500
Sorry about the cold.

673
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,440
I hear it goes away,
eventually, though.

674
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,600
What else have you heard?

675
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,040
Oh... that you can see me.

676
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,300
That you can hear me.

677
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:28,100
That, uh, that's pretty rare.

678
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,470
I am really sorry, Clay.

679
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,120
The other day,
outside my house...

680
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,230
I wasn't sure.

681
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,540
I thought you might be...

682
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,300
But I wasn't sure.

683
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,200
I'm really glad you're here.

684
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,800
I'm really glad
I get to say good-bye.

685
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,600
Don't be sorry.
Nothing to be sorry about.

686
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,970
Truth is, I've been flirting
with this all my life.

687
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,540
Now that I'm here...

688
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:00,170
it's not like the view's
all that bad.

689
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,640
You know what
else I heard?

690
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,400
What's that?

691
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,700
That if I try hard enough,

692
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:14,070
that if I want it bad enough,

693
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,840
sometimes, someone like me

694
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:21,740
can be felt...

695
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,070
by someone like you.

696
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,070
I have to tell you,
I've never...

697
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,200
Allison?

698
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,940
Do you want a hand
locking up?

699
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,500
Uh... sure.

700
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,500
Absolutely.

701
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,140
Hello, Detective.

702
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,390
Your deputy-ship.

703
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,990
Haven't seen you
in a couple of days.

704
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,390
You know what's been going on.

705
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,520
I look up from my desk,
it's 11:00 at night.

706
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,850
Well, the mayor's
back in town now.

707
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,620
I saw it right on the
front page of the paper.

708
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,650
No reason for you not
to come over tonight.

709
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,450
Well, then maybe I will.

710
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,650
Well, if you ring the bell,
maybe I'll let you in.

711
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,950
10:00-ish okay?

712
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,630
I got a call from this woman
in the third district.

713
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,040
Worked on our last campaign.

714
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,240
Wants to buy me a drink.

715
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,340
She was very insistent.

716
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,440
You sure it was a woman?

717
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,200
Don't you have somewhere
you need to be?

718
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,440
Oh, um...

719
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:22,440
So... 10:00-ish.

720
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,840
Hey.

721
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,800
Hey.

722
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,100
(clears throat)
Allison here yet?

723
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,340
She's the one who wanted
to have this meeting.

724
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:40,070
I've got a doctor's thing
this afternoon,

725
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,500
desk full of work.

726
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,200
Excuse me.

727
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,140
SCANLON:
The dead woman, the
driver of the minivan,

728
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,000
name is Olga Bankova.

729
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,500
She's a naturalized
U.S. citizen,

730
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,100
34 years old, single mother,
artist of some kind.

731
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,870
Also works as a substitute
teacher; no priors.

732
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,540
They were over 200 miles
from home when they died.

733
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:01,070
The child in the backseat
was her son Ian.

734
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,070
Seven years old.

735
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,300
What else do we know?
Not much.

736
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,200
We're checking paint and body
shops around the state,

737
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,500
looking for any large vehicles
with horizontal abrasions

738
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,800
consistent with
the minivan's.

739
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,300
So...

740
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,840
we're certain the car
was pushed into that lake bed?

741
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,370
No.
Yes.

742
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
No one in the crime lab
is willing to say

743
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,240
in a definitive way that the
minivan was actually pushed

744
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,130
into that lake bed.

745
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,550
Yes, there's paint on the car,
yes, the side is scraped

746
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,790
consistent with that kind
of scenario

747
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,350
but the vehicle also took
about a 40-foot fall,

748
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,750
which could account
for the damage

749
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,050
and the mismatched paint could
also be from a previous mishap.

750
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,390
That coupled with the fact
that no one

751
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,220
can seem to come up
with any kind of motive...

752
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,150
I know that she was pushed
off the road.

753
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,990
I saw it happen.
My daughter saw it, too.

754
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,050
Your daughter?

755
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,350
Really?

756
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,590
Did either one of you,
perchance,

757
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,090
see who was driving
the other vehicle?

758
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,050
I didn't, no.

759
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,780
What about your daughter?

760
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,620
My daughter doesn't have any
information you could use.

761
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,890
I don't understand.

762
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,220
I'm gathering that, like you,

763
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,990
your daughter saw all this
in a dream.

764
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,490
Don't you think
it might be useful to us

765
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,750
to interview her, see
if we couldn't piece together

766
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,250
some kind of description?

767
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,750
I'm familiar with a number of
people from around the state

768
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,250
who have a lot of expertise

769
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,750
when it comes
to interviewing children.

770
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,590
I mean, we'd have to finesse
the whole dream thing,

771
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,750
but I'm sure
it could be handled.

772
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:20,950
She saw them,
but she didn't see them.

773
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,520
Look, it was a cartoon.

774
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,150
She saw the whole thing
as a cartoon.

775
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:29,020
The people who pushed
the minivan off the road

776
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,190
were cartoon people.

777
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,050
Everybody was a cartoon.

778
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,220
I see.

779
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,700
Any news
on the home invasion front?

780
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,200
SCANLON:
Not really. No.

781
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,200
Place turned out to be
amazingly clean.

782
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,800
I mean,
clearly these guys were pros.

783
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,370
Aha.

784
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,720
No leads
on the home invasion front.

785
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,350
Dark cartoon forces at work,

786
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,050
pushing vehicles off
our thoroughfares.

787
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,950
It's a wonderful day
to be the district attorney.

788
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,820
Excuse me?

789
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,520
You're excused.

790
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,190
(mimics):
"It's a wonderful day
to be the district attorney."

791
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,680
You know the man's under
a lot of pressure.

792
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:09,720
That's not the point.
It was mean.

793
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,850
It was needlessly mean.

794
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,050
He's not himself.

795
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,490
I don't know what's
wrong with him.

796
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,350
Who are you guys talking about?
Nobody.

797
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,190
You know, all they're talking
about on the radio is

798
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,520
how these guys are
still out there,

799
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,620
it's just a matter of time
before they do it again.

800
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,990
Okay, I get it.

801
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,390
He's under a lot of pressure
on that case,

802
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,990
and I'm not helping him
on that case.

803
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,150
Well, I'm sorry.

804
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,790
I wish I could pick and choose
what I dream

805
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,320
on any given day, but I can't.

806
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,690
So it isn't
the crime du jour.

807
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,190
I can't help that.

808
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,750
I see what I see, and I know
what I know and my daughter...

809
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,090
Uh-uh...
I think you're blowing this

810
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,950
way out of proportion.
My daughter

811
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,790
doesn't get to specify
the style of presentation

812
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,920
when someone reaches out to her
from the great beyond

813
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,090
to tell her something.
"Well, I'm sorry,

814
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,950
we're not accepting
cartoon dreams today."

815
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,890
The district attorney prefers
his clues from the other side

816
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,520
more straightforward.

817
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,890
More crime, less character.

818
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,850
More like an episode
of Law & Order.

819
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:56,850
Allison.

820
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,450
Are you talking about me?

821
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,050
No, honey,
nobody's talking about you.

822
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,850
Nobody's talking about anybody.

823
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:04,290
I need a bath.

824
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,150
Is something wrong, Mommy?

825
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,450
It's not you guys.

826
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,420
Mommy just had a hard day.

827
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,550
No, I'm, uh, I'm still here.

828
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,420
Of course.
I know it's dinnertime.

829
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,750
He just wanted
to run some tests,

830
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,690
and I'm just sitting here
waiting for the results.

831
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,050
I'll call you when I'm done.

832
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,720
I love you, too.

833
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
I've been guarding
it with my life.

834
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,190
I appreciate it.

835
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,720
Yeah?

836
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,220
Bridge and Marie are down.

837
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,250
Ariel's taking a shower.

838
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,890
I thought I would just lock up
and go to bed.

839
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,950
Oh, my God,
how long have I been in here?

840
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,150
That's all right;
you look comfortable.

841
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,420
You're allowed.

842
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,720
I'll be back.
I won't let you drown.

843
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,550
WOMAN:
We're very aware
of everything

844
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,120
that's been going on
with the mayor.

845
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:25,590
We're all aware
of how mercurial he can be.

846
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,650
You've been very deft

847
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,250
the way you've covered for him.

848
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,890
That's my job.

849
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,050
Oh, and you
do it well.

850
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:36,420
You seem very, um,
at ease on television.

851
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,580
Oh?

852
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,880
Have you ever considered
running for office?

853
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,350
Excuse me?

854
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:44,720
We'd like to see you go after
a spot on city council.

855
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,990
Oh, let me ask
you something.

856
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,620
How do I do this?

857
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,790
Just ask her.

858
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,890
You got a boyfriend?

859
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,850
Hopefully, a doctor
or a lawyer.

860
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,790
Someone with some standing.

861
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:19,850
I'm just kidding.

862
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,850
But seriously, is there someone
we should know about?

863
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,250
Whoever they are,
they're going to end up
being very involved.

864
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,320
Please, whomever it might be,

865
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:30,050
just don't let it be
a civil servant.

866
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,220
All of the union agreements
are coming up in January,

867
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,650
(laughs):
and that's all we need.

868
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,120
I'd do that for you,
if I could.

869
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,410
1

870
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,230
I'm beginning to think
it's a big lie.

871
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:53,470
2

872
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,100
What are you doing here?
3

873
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,850
4

874
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,050
But that's crazy.

875
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,110
That's wrong.
You can't be here.

876
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,830
You can't do this.

877
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,900
I have a family,
and you have someplace

878
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:07,060
you're supposed to be.

879
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,760
Well, I like it here.

880
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,560
I like your house;
it feels good.

881
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,700
I like your kids.

882
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:14,060
You're not thinking clearly.

883
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,060
You must still be in shock.

884
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,600
And you're leaving
out my husband.

885
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,100
I have a husband.
I have a life.

886
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,760
Really?
(door opens)

887
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,200
Locked and loaded.

888
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,900
Hey, you know what?

889
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:31,730
Wet becomes you, my darling.

890
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,200
You look good like that.

891
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,360
I may toss you
in that tub every night.

892
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,060
"Wet becomes you"?

893
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,160
This is so unfair.

894
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,260
(chuckles)
What's that?
I say the wrong thing?

895
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,760
You want me to go?

896
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,460
Just say, "Clay,
I need you to go."

897
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,630
JOE:
I can't help it.
You come over here

898
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,760
and look at yourself
in that water,

899
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,760
in the candlelight.

900
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,200
Sorry, baby, it's
bigger than both of us.

901
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,500
Kind of a goofball, huh?

902
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:02,430
Stop it.

903
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,530
You're seriously
bothered?

904
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,960
Just say, "Clay, I need
you to go."

905
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,360
See, this is it.
This is the kind of stuff.

906
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,200
This is why we were
never meant to be.

907
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,460
What are you talking about?

908
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,130
"Never meant to be"?

909
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,230
Does he know he's got
toothpaste on his mouth?

910
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,660
Does he have any idea
how sad and pathetic

911
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,530
this all is?
Clay, I need you to go!

912
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,560
Clay?

913
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,230
Did you say "Clay"?

914
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,330
As in high school Clay?

915
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,130
Is he here?

916
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,700
Allison?

917
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,300
Hey, Allison!

918
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:39,400
Allison!

919
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,260
(screaming):
Mommy!

920
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,330
Is he in here?
I don't see him, no.

921
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,900
Then where is he, Allison?

922
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,560
I don't know.
I don't see him, either.

923
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,000
You expect me
to believe that?

924
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,000
BRIDGETTE (screaming):
Mommy!

925
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,100
Hello?

926
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:55,160
Hey, you still coming over?

927
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,230
How'd the drink thing go?

928
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,500
They just left.
It went great.

929
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,530
It went really great.

930
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,360
But I need to talk
to you about something.

931
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,200
Anything.
What's going on?

932
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,660
Hang on a second, honey,
I'm getting another call.

933
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,700
Baby, whatever it is,
it's gonna have to hold.

934
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:17,530
I just got a call.

935
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,130
Somebody hit a mansion
in Bear Park.

936
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,530
I don't have all
the details yet,

937
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,830
but, uh, looks like I'm gonna
have to run out there.

938
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,900
Hello?

939
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,900
Oh, yes, I understand.

940
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,900
He's right here.

941
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:38,400
Manuel?

942
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,800
What are you doing?

943
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,830
There's been another one
of those house things.

944
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,860
Okay, I know.

945
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,660
The light is on, right?

946
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,160
You turned
on the lamp?

947
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,060
The lamp is on?
What are you talking about?

948
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,600
Yes, the light is on.
They're on the phone.

949
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,160
Shh, don't panic. Just tell them
I'll call them back.

950
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,660
What are you talking about
you'll "call them back"?

951
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,960
Lilly...

952
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,860
listen to me.

953
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,530
Don't be alarmed...

954
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,360
but I can't see a damn thing.

955
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,300
(crying)
Shh, Bridgette.

956
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,130
(phone ringing)
Sweetie, it was
just a bad dream.

957
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,600
Sweetie, stop. You're
gonna make yourself sick.

958
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,600
It's Scanlon.

959
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:20,860
Hello?
Come here.

960
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,900
SCANLON (on phone):
Allison, it happened again.

961
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,030
They got the man of the house.

962
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,330
He has a golf club.

963
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,200
The Mom...

964
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,360
In the hall, yeah.

965
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,860
What about the baby?

966
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,900
Did they get the baby?

967
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:37,400
Yeah, they got the baby, too.

968
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:39,150
How'd you know?

969
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:39,160
5

970
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,610
Go to sleep, Joe.

971
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:46,810
I can't go to sleep.

972
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,650
He's not here.

973
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:52,810
You don't know that.

974
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,210
I don't see him.
I don't see him anywhere.

975
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,510
I would tell you
if I did.

976
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,450
But you're not
even looking.

977
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,950
I don't see him.

978
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,110
I swear.
Right.

979
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,350
Uh-huh.
What, you don't
believe me?

980
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,880
Allison, the man has
apparently been here

981
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,280
for two whole days.

982
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,650
Now, either you forgot

983
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,610
to mention it or he
can choose when it is

984
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:17,650
that you see him, and neither
of those two scenarios

985
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,810
makes me particularly
comfortable.

986
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:21,710
You know, you can
really be an ass.

987
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:22,850
I didn't do this, Allison.

988
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,310
I'm going to go sleep
in the girls' room.

989
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:26,950
Go.
Holler if you see a ghost.

990
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,710
Yeah, if you see a ghost,
remember:

991
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,710
you're a married woman.

992
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:36,150
Hey, "Allibaster."

993
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,110
Your guy's got quite
the temper, huh?

994
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,650
You think he has a temper?

995
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,280
Shh, down, girl.

996
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:44,480
How dare you--
camp out in my house?!

997
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:46,480
Toy with my family,
toy with me,

998
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,480
someone you claim to care about?

999
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:49,650
I hate you.

1000
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,710
No, you don't.
Yes,

1001
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:54,150
I do and I need you
to leave my house.

1002
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,380
Funny how
things work out.

1003
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:58,180
You know, when we were in
school, I thought you were

1004
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,710
the smartest thing
on two legs.

1005
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:02,210
When we were in school,
I thought you were smug.

1006
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:05,450
And vain and selfish
and nice to look at

1007
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,950
and maybe, deep down,
had a heart.

1008
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,480
I guess I was wrong
about the heart.

1009
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:11,350
You know, he's mistaken
about you in there.

1010
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,280
Pissed off becomes you.

1011
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,710
Leave my house!

1012
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,750
Don't you think I
would, if I could?

1013
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,750
Well, maybe you just
have to try harder.

1014
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,210
Come on, you can do it.

1015
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,410
Find a light
and walk into it.

1016
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:26,250
You think it's just
a coincidence I ended up here,

1017
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,780
out of all the places
in all the world?

1018
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:29,410
Your house?

1019
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:32,150
You think it's an
accident you can see me?

1020
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:35,450
Hear me? I don't.

1021
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,050
I've been to a lot of places,
I've seen a lot of things.

1022
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,380
I don't believe in coincidence.

1023
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:41,910
I'm here for a reason...

1024
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,580
like it or not, baby.

1025
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:46,610
I think that
reason is you.

1026
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,750
Mommy, I got scared and I
thought I heard voices.

1027
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,950
It's just me, sweetie,
talking to myself.

1028
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,810
Did you have a bad dream?

1029
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:59,910
Uh... kind of.

1030
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:02,880
Do you want to come in my
bed and sleep with me?

1031
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,650
That might make it all better.

1032
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,580
If you don't mind.

1033
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:10,010
Okay, just this once.

1034
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,910
As long as we don't
make a habit out of it.

1035
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:14,010
(chuckles):
Okay.

1036
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,680
(beeping)
MAN:
Mr. Devalos.

1037
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:22,280
I'm going to shine a very bright
light into your eyes.

1038
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,550
I need you to tell me
if you see something.

1039
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,550
Anything.

1040
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,110
DEVALOS:
Uh, yeah.

1041
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,080
It's very blurry, but I can see.

1042
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,980
I see you and I see the room.

1043
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:34,580
And I can see you, Lilly.

1044
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:37,650
My best guess is
that we're looking
at a severe case

1045
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,580
of diabetic retinopathy.

1046
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:41,150
Blood sugar's
off the charts.

1047
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,080
You're lucky you
can see at all.

1048
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:44,680
You're lucky
you're conscious.

1049
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:45,950
DEVALOS:
What does this mean?

1050
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,610
Is this thing curable?

1051
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:48,950
It means we wait.

1052
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:51,250
Wait for that insulin
we're putting in you

1053
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,080
to hopefully start
doing its work.

1054
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:54,750
And wait for the
doctors who really

1055
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,910
know their way
around this stuff

1056
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:58,350
to get here, which
may be a little bit.

1057
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,810
It is 4:00 in the
morning, you know.

1058
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,480
LILLY:
But he's gonna be okay?

1059
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:03,650
We just have to hope the
damage isn't too great.

1060
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,610
Mr. Devalos...

1061
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:08,480
when was the last
time you saw a doctor?

1062
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:13,450
DEVALOS (sighing):
I honestly don't know.

1063
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,650
I really can't remember.

1064
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,880
I'm gonna shut
this light off.

1065
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,910
I suggest you
get some rest.

1066
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:23,950
Okay.
Mommy.

1067
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,350
I know.

1068
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,950
I saw it, too.

1069
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,580
It's okay, honey.

1070
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,180
It's okay,
it was just a cartoon.

1071
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:32,050
Okay? Shh.

1072
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,300
DEVALOS:
Hey.

1073
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,500
I can see you.

1074
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,930
Hey.

1075
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,600
I can see you, too.

1076
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:51,260
You look kind of soft and gauzy,

1077
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,230
kind of like an angel.

1078
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:57,200
Kind of like...

1079
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:58,860
we might be in heaven.

1080
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,260
We're not dead, are we?

1081
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,860
God, I hope not.

1082
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,030
I have a bunch of stuff I have
to pick up at the dry cleaners.

1083
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,330
If I'm dead,
Joe will never remember

1084
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,930
where I keep the tickets.

1085
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,430
What did you do?

1086
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:15,530
The dentist, the doctor, flying.

1087
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,300
Those are my three big demons.

1088
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,960
When I was a teenager,

1089
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,900
my... my mother

1090
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:27,600
worked in a department store
refolding merchandise

1091
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,960
at night after
everyone had gone home.

1092
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,400
She didn't even feel bad.

1093
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:36,530
Just a little pain
under her arm.

1094
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,330
Ignored it for the longest time.

1095
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,300
Store insisted she see someone.

1096
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:45,330
And then, six weeks later...

1097
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:51,760
I do believe that's
the last time I ever cried.

1098
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,800
Got a life's worth of tears out.

1099
00:53:58,330 --> 00:53:59,500
You come all this way

1100
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:02,230
just to give me that
swell-looking balloon?

1101
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,630
Olga Bankova and her son
were run off the road

1102
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,300
by the same people who killed
the Costigan family last week,

1103
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,960
slaughtered the Milano family
last night.

1104
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,330
And you know this how?

1105
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,800
I know.

1106
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,330
We're still in the land
of cartoon people, right?

1107
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,300
I'd really like to see
where they lived,

1108
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:27,860
this boy and his mother.

1109
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,030
We've already had
a detective out there,

1110
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,060
but, sure, you're welcome
to take a look.

1111
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,130
Hey, hold on a second.

1112
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,260
Uh, thought you
were a friend.

1113
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,930
Gaze into your crystal ball.

1114
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,330
Give a sick man some hope.

1115
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,460
It just doesn't work that way.

1116
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,700
A lot of times,

1117
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:53,160
the people closest to me...

1118
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,760
I didn't even know you were ill.

1119
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,960
I do know
that your wife loves you.

1120
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,460
We passed
in the hall.

1121
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,200
She was going home to clean up,

1122
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,000
call relatives.

1123
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:08,800
It just poured off her.

1124
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:10,730
"I love this man.

1125
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,460
"I'm so angry at this man.

1126
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,660
"I love this man.

1127
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,700
I am so angry at this man."

1128
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:28,530
ALLISON:
Thank you.

1129
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:40,000
They smashed their way
through this door.

1130
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:42,500
Who, the cartoon bad guys?

1131
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:44,200
It's an old,
rotted doorjamb,

1132
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:46,430
an old, rotted door.

1133
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,900
If she didn't have it locked,
didn't have the chain on it,

1134
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:49,930
you could kick this open,

1135
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,000
we'd never even know.

1136
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,260
What is it we're
looking for again?

1137
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,960
I don't know, a reason why
killers who hit wealthy families

1138
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,700
for no reason at all
would also kill

1139
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,100
a substitute teacher
and her child.

1140
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,480
SCANLON:
Methinks the woman
liked to paint.

1141
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:28,680
Look at this.

1142
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,710
It looks like she's trying
to learn how to paint

1143
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,280
in the style
of this artist.

1144
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,250
Do these look familiar?

1145
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,710
Sure. I'd recognize
that squiggle anywhere.

1146
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,280
It's after
5:00, Allison.

1147
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:46,650
We've got at least a
two-hour drive back.

1148
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,550
Allison?

1149
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:54,210
The food court at the mall?

1150
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:56,510
You can have dinner
anywhere you want,

1151
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:59,250
and you want to have it
at the food court at the mall?

1152
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,810
Daddy, if you don't really
want to know, you shouldn't ask.

1153
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:03,810
What's wrong with the
food court at the mall?

1154
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:05,050
They have everything.

1155
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,210
They have food from
all over the world.

1156
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:10,110
Okay, the people have spoken.

1157
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:11,750
Let me just get
out of these clothes,

1158
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,580
and we'll head out to the mall.

1159
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:15,710
Yippee.

1160
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,450
Hello?

1161
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:45,850
She is my wife, you know.

1162
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:50,650
Mine.

1163
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,310
I know what you're thinking.

1164
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:57,010
You're thinking,
what am I gonna do, kill you?

1165
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,680
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1166
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:03,310
But I will figure something out.

1167
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:07,210
I am gonna make your death

1168
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,210
more miserable than your life.

1169
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:20,510
She's mine.

1170
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,710
Hey, Ariel?

1171
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,750
Ariel, sweetie,
come here for a second.

1172
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:36,910
Hey, come here.
What are you doing?

1173
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:38,310
I thought you
were changing.

1174
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:40,810
I thought we were
going to the mall.
We are, we are.

1175
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,250
Just have a look
around the room.

1176
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,350
Okay.

1177
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:45,410
What am I
looking for?

1178
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:46,850
I don't know.
What do you see?

1179
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,550
Do you see anything?

1180
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,010
What are you
talking about?

1181
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:52,550
I see what you see.

1182
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,610
It's your room.

1183
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:56,110
It looks like your
room always looks.

1184
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:57,310
Are you okay?

1185
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:58,580
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just curious.

1186
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:00,280
So...

1187
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:03,650
there's nothing you see in here
that's out of the ordinary?

1188
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,850
I don't know.

1189
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,750
Did Mommy get a new
bedspread or something?

1190
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,280
Huh.

1191
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,680
It's the wind, Daddy.

1192
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:22,080
It's just the wind.

1193
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:24,310
Huh.

1194
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:25,610
I'm really hungry.

1195
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:27,250
We're all
really hungry.

1196
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,250
Yes, me, too.

1197
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,610
Come on.

1198
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:32,650
I'll change later.
Let's get out of here.

1199
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,050
Let's go.

1200
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,760
6

1201
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,530
Look at this.
Together again.

1202
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:10,400
If we're here,
who's running the city?

1203
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:14,760
Could you have picked
a more out of the way place?

1204
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,360
Yeah, pretty
obscure, huh?

1205
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:20,080
May I start you off
with something to drink?

1206
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:21,550
You on the clock?

1207
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,110
I'll have a scotch
and soda.

1208
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:26,850
The lady will have
a dirty martini.

1209
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,310
So, when last we spoke, uh...

1210
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:30,650
DINOVI:
When last we spoke...

1211
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,010
Where do I start?

1212
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:35,710
Drinks... Lady from
the third district...

1213
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,150
It went great.

1214
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:39,250
It's been 24 hours, and
I still don't believe it.

1215
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,280
Believe what?

1216
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:44,450
They want me to run
for city council.

1217
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:48,850
(exhales)
I should cancel the cocktails

1218
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,280
and get us
a bottle of champagne.

1219
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,510
Don't do that.
I've been dreaming

1220
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:52,610
about a martini all day.

1221
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:53,910
A martini? Not me?

1222
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:55,250
A martini and you.

1223
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,910
I was just

1224
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:59,450
so completely
taken by surprise.

1225
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,250
Then they started hitting
me with questions.

1226
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,480
Questions?

1227
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:05,510
"Where were you born?
Are you a native?

1228
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:06,750
"Do you belong
to any clubs?

1229
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:07,780
Are you involved
with anyone?"

1230
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:09,080
You fess up?

1231
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,110
I told them the truth.

1232
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:13,050
That, for all intents
and purposes, I'm...

1233
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,780
You're at my house
one or two nights a week.

1234
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:16,580
Well, no, I didn't
tell them that.

1235
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:18,680
I don't think a woman
running for office

1236
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,410
should be bragging about
making the walk of shame

1237
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:22,680
from her lover's apartment to
her car at 6:30 in the morning,

1238
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:25,550
praying that nobody sees her.

1239
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:27,150
Yeah, well...

1240
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,810
...I want to talk to you
about that.

1241
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:32,580
No, it's okay.

1242
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:33,950
I realized something.

1243
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:36,480
I like what we have,
the way we have it.

1244
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,750
I wasn't sure
at first.

1245
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:43,180
Never been with someone who
didn't want to come home with me

1246
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:44,980
to my folks at
Christmas, but...

1247
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:45,980
but it's okay.

1248
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:47,210
It's actually good.

1249
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:50,250
One of the things these
people said to me was,

1250
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,010
I guess a lot of the
union agreements--

1251
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:56,010
police, fire, teachers--
they're all coming up next year.

1252
01:01:56,050 --> 01:02:00,210
I mean, the last thing they
wanted to hear was that I'm--

1253
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:04,480
whatever you call this thing we
have-- with a civil servant.

1254
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,050
Is that what I am,
a civil servant?

1255
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,780
What? No.

1256
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:14,210
That's their word.

1257
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:15,250
It's really just about...

1258
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,510
I get the point.

1259
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:18,700
They don't want you
sleeping with the help.

1260
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:20,630
It's really just about
these negotiations.

1261
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:21,930
What did you say?

1262
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,810
(cell phone ringing)
There was nothing to say.

1263
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,110
Got it.

1264
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:33,480
I'll see you there.

1265
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:35,900
Wait a second.

1266
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,130
I thought we were having dinner.

1267
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,310
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

1268
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:39,950
I'm just a civil servant.

1269
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:42,050
I get a call, I go to work.

1270
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,950
Lee...
What?

1271
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,060
Hey, some people just got shot
to death in Hasbrook Heights.

1272
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,180
The mayor's back in town,

1273
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:50,780
so you're not
getting the call,

1274
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:52,210
but I'm just a working guy.

1275
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,210
Enjoy your drink; it's paid for.

1276
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,350
Are you hurt?

1277
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:59,380
You don't even let me keep
a toothbrush at your place

1278
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:01,380
and you're hurt?!

1279
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:02,880
I'm not hurt.

1280
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:03,880
I'm thrilled for you.

1281
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:05,980
You have my vote.

1282
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:08,380
But I got to go.

1283
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:14,810
Will the gentleman
be returning?

1284
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:23,050
It's Scanlon.
He says it's important.

1285
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,850
You didn't have another
bad dream, did you?

1286
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:31,480
Hello?

1287
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:34,110
SCANLON:
You want the good news, the bad
news or the very bad news?

1288
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:35,910
Just tell me
what's going on.

1289
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:38,410
(over phone):
Another home invasion.

1290
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:41,010
Only this time, the homeowner
was packing heat.

1291
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,950
Killed all three of them.

1292
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:44,180
I think it's over, Allison.

1293
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:45,880
I think it's all over.

1294
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:47,380
Okay.

1295
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:49,850
What about the very bad news?

1296
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,580
Your boss is still
in the hospital.

1297
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:53,450
I need you to get dressed
and come downtown

1298
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,180
and help me interrogate
the solid citizen

1299
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:56,550
who gunned down
these three bastards.

1300
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:57,880
What is it, Mommy?

1301
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,310
Who's on the phone?

1302
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:00,680
Hold on.

1303
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:01,680
It's the police, honey.

1304
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,450
They got the bad Monkeyheads.

1305
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,880
They're not gonna bother
anybody anymore.

1306
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:08,910
SCANLON:
Spell your name
for me, please.

1307
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:10,450
Alan Gardner.

1308
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,950
G-A-R-D-N-E-R.

1309
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:14,450
And I should warn you,

1310
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,710
I don't think
I'm actually sick, but I...

1311
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:16,260
We know.

1312
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,330
We know that you've been through
a lot tonight.

1313
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:21,250
The officer mentioned
that you've been throwing up.

1314
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:25,800
I think it's just nerves.

1315
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,630
I'm actually feeling
a little better right now.

1316
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:31,400
You want to tell
us what happened?

1317
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:33,760
What happened...

1318
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,300
I don't know...
I mean, I guess,

1319
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:39,430
like everybody with a big
house, I've been on edge.

1320
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,560
It was the staff's
night off.

1321
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,600
I had been reading.

1322
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:45,160
Fell asleep in bed.

1323
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,260
Then the alarm went off.

1324
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,200
What did you do?

1325
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:50,100
I ran into the closet.

1326
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:52,860
It's like a little
vault, actually--

1327
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,230
fireproof.

1328
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:58,700
I keep some papers there,
antiquities, canvases.

1329
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:00,430
I'm an art dealer.

1330
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:03,100
And I thought, well, I'll just
lock the door and stay in here.

1331
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:04,730
I don't think they can
shoot through it.

1332
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,060
Like a panic room.

1333
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,060
Yeah.

1334
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:08,060
But small.

1335
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,160
And there's monitors in there.

1336
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,400
So I can see them moving
through the house.

1337
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:13,300
And I know the police
are trying to call.

1338
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:16,600
And I thought for a moment,

1339
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:19,360
I think I might actually
live through this thing.

1340
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,260
Then they shot Keezey.

1341
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:32,300
That little schnauzer
is the only family I have.

1342
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,800
I mean, you go through
the housebreaking,

1343
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:41,860
the bladder infections,
the doggie tumors,

1344
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,900
and you just never imagine...

1345
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,260
Even on the
black-and-white monitor,

1346
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,460
I can see him lying there,

1347
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,900
the blood coming
out of his body.

1348
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:59,200
That's when I saw the gun...

1349
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:02,660
the rifle, box of ammo...

1350
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,400
I got it, like,
six years ago,

1351
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:07,160
to go skeet shooting with
a client, which I hated.

1352
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,830
So much noise, and it...

1353
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,830
hurt my shoulder.

1354
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:18,200
Then I went out
into the hall.

1355
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:22,660
The way the stairs work,
you can't see into the hall

1356
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:25,200
unless you're at the top.

1357
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:29,460
And I just waited.

1358
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,700
(gunshots)

1359
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:43,400
(gently):
Mr. Gardner?

1360
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:46,930
I am a civilized person.

1361
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,660
I know they were killers.

1362
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,160
They killed my Keezey.

1363
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,860
But I just never imagined,
in the course of my life,

1364
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:57,000
that I would actually
kill another man.

1365
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:01,530
Three other men.

1366
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:06,100
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1367
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:22,460
Look who's returning
to the marital bed.

1368
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:28,100
What is it, like,
4:00 in the morning?

1369
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:30,200
It's nice of you to
make an appearance.

1370
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:31,560
It's, like, 5:00.

1371
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,900
Or five-oh-s...

1372
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,360
...seven.

1373
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,060
I think it's really over.

1374
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:51,100
The home invaders are dead.

1375
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:54,100
This meek little
art dealer shot them

1376
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:58,130
'cause they killed his dog.

1377
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:01,200
Bridgette will be relieved.

1378
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:04,360
No more bad dreams.

1379
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,400
It's funny the way
stuff happens.

1380
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:15,000
I think your boyfriend's
gone, by the way.

1381
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:16,600
ALLISON:
Oh, yeah?

1382
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:18,500
JOE:
We had a chat.

1383
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,960
I mean, I had a chat.

1384
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,300
And I think
he heard it,

1385
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:25,660
because I haven't felt
any cold breezes,

1386
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,660
and he hasn't
been seen since.

1387
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,460
What do you mean?

1388
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,200
Seen by who?
Who could see him?

1389
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:33,300
He's a ghost.

1390
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:35,700
I had Ariel take a
little look for him.

1391
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:38,330
I mean, she didn't know

1392
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,830
that that's who she
was looking for.

1393
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:41,830
You did not.
Yes...

1394
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,700
I certainly did.

1395
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:51,030
Did you think I was just gonna
give you up without a fight?

1396
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:57,500
I love you with
all my heart.

1397
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:37,160
You got it now?

1398
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,230
You got it figured out?
'Cause I got to go.

1399
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:47,830
SCANLON:
Wow, what are you doing here?

1400
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:49,460
Aren't you the lady
who was with me

1401
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,160
till almost 4:30 this morning?

1402
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,730
Shouldn't you be
at home sleeping?

1403
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,730
I tried sleeping.

1404
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,530
I kept dreaming.

1405
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,560
What about you?
Why aren't you home sleeping?

1406
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,660
I don't know.

1407
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,460
Phone kept ringing.

1408
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,760
You wanted to see me.
Is something up?

1409
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,260
It's like I said,
I keep having dreams.

1410
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:09,430
Yeah? So?

1411
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:13,300
Isn't that kind of like Einstein
always having brainstorms?

1412
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:14,330
You recognize this?

1413
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:15,360
Thought you said
you would

1414
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,600
recognize this
squiggle anywhere.

1415
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:19,160
It's that painting Devalos
told us was so valuable,

1416
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,630
that was hanging
at the first house.

1417
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:23,730
Okay.
Remember

1418
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,630
those little paintings at Olga's
house I was looking at--

1419
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:27,930
I told you they reminded me
of something?

1420
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:30,500
This is the painting
they remind me of.

1421
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:32,900
I'm glad we, uh,
solved that mystery.
I think she was

1422
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:35,360
trying to learn how to paint
in the style of this painter.

1423
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,430
I think she was trying to learn
to paint this painting.

1424
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:41,230
You think they killed her
for that?

1425
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:42,830
How does that explain
the other killings?

1426
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:45,730
How does that explain the home
invasions in two other states?

1427
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,460
To be honest, I don't know.
I just...

1428
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:51,400
Both those houses are still
crime scenes, right?

1429
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:53,560
Could someone possibly

1430
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,660
just bring me this painting?

1431
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:58,260
Maybe all the little ones
I was looking at

1432
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,700
at Olga's house?
Allison, is it possible

1433
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:02,030
that in all the hubbub last
night, that you missed the part

1434
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,560
where the home invaders
were shot to death?

1435
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,900
No, I heard that.

1436
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:06,800
Did you miss the part
where I said
(phone rings)

1437
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:08,900
I was still having
dreams about it all?

1438
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,300
So what do you think?

1439
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:17,810
I think someone's in a mood.

1440
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:19,380
Sorry.

1441
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:22,680
A friend of mine who was
visiting left suddenly.

1442
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:24,210
I guess...

1443
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:27,150
I guess I wanted to say good-bye
more than I realized.

1444
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:29,380
Yeah, good-byes are
a bitch, aren't they.

1445
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,410
WOMAN:
How's your vision?

1446
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:31,380
It's good.

1447
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:32,350
I can see perfectly.

1448
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:33,680
I feel good, too.

1449
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:35,410
Frankly, Doctor, I feel ready
to get out of here.

1450
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:36,710
Ready to get back to work.

1451
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,580
Well, that's what's going
to kill you, you know.

1452
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:39,710
How good you feel.

1453
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:43,410
You have diabetes,
Mr. District Attorney.

1454
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:45,510
I think that you've probably
had it for years,

1455
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:46,610
but you just didn't know.

1456
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:48,450
It's a sneaky little bastard.

1457
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,080
If you're not checking for it,

1458
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:52,550
it doesn't let you know it's
there until it's good and ready

1459
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:54,550
to give you a stroke
or a heart attack,

1460
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:56,760
make you impotent
or strike you blind.

1461
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,230
Are you trying to frighten me?

1462
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:01,030
No, I am trying
to warn you.

1463
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:03,100
Now, I can see you
every three months.

1464
01:12:03,130 --> 01:12:04,230
We can monitor this thing.

1465
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,500
I can teach you how to get
on top of it.

1466
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:08,560
Or I can see you
in a couple of years.

1467
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:11,430
Now, if they manage to keep
you alive until you get

1468
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,200
to the hospital,
well, then we can

1469
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:15,960
chat about how high on your leg
we need to amputate

1470
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,660
or maybe
where the best Braille

1471
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,860
classes are.

1472
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,960
Okay, so what
does this prove?

1473
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,030
You know, I don't know anything
about this stuff, Allison.

1474
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,500
Yeah, I know. Me neither.

1475
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:40,760
But I know someone who does.

1476
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,400
Hey, I just wanted
to let you know

1477
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:43,560
I'm heading out to Carefree.

1478
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,260
Paying a visit to Alan Gardner.

1479
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,260
That gallery owner who shot
those three home invaders.

1480
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,630
Are you okay to drive?

1481
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:52,130
What'd you get,
about 15 minutes sleep?

1482
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,700
No, I'm fine.

1483
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:55,130
I'm not going to be there long.

1484
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:57,030
I've just have a couple
paintings in the car

1485
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:59,130
I asked him to take a look at.

1486
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,860
Hey, can I ask you something?

1487
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,500
Hmm? Sure.

1488
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:05,000
What did you say to him?

1489
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:06,630
What are you talking about?

1490
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:08,630
To Clay. Last night.

1491
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:14,060
You know what?

1492
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:16,000
I'm sorry I mentioned it.
It was silly.

1493
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:17,760
I'm sure that
there was nobody there.

1494
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,400
Okay. But what did you say
to him?

1495
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,530
Hello?

1496
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:30,900
CLAY:
He said, "She's mine."

1497
01:13:30,930 --> 01:13:34,800
He said everything
you'd want him to say.

1498
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:37,800
He said everything
you'd hoped he'd say,

1499
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,430
if some crazy numbskull
showed up on your doorstep

1500
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:43,460
with the idea that maybe
he could have you back.

1501
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:53,330
Sorry. I-I lost you.

1502
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:57,430
Yeah, well, um, I don't know
what to tell you.

1503
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:00,130
I don't know, exactly,

1504
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,600
what I said, and I really
don't think it matters.

1505
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:04,830
You're right.
It doesn't matter.

1506
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:07,800
I mean, I don't know what I was
getting so worked up about.

1507
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,800
After all... I'm here.

1508
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:15,200
Till death do us part.

1509
01:14:15,230 --> 01:14:16,600
Yes.

1510
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:19,430
And who knows.
Maybe longer.

1511
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:22,130
I'll see you when I get home.

1512
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:24,960
I will see you
when you get home.

1513
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,260
He's a good man.

1514
01:14:35,330 --> 01:14:37,260
I know.

1515
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:39,860
I was wrong
about why I'm here.

1516
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:42,560
And you were right.

1517
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:45,530
And I am smug, vain, selfish...

1518
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,230
even in death.

1519
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:50,830
None of this has anything
to do with me.

1520
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:53,460
I finally figured that out
last night.

1521
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:56,230
I'm not here to woo you.

1522
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:58,830
I'm here to help you.

1523
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:01,060
To tell you something

1524
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:03,560
that you otherwise
wouldn't know.

1525
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,160
To redeem myself.

1526
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:12,830
And then, Allison,
I think I'll be on my way.

1527
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:16,360
You sent me that dream
last night, didn't you?

1528
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,400
The one with

1529
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:19,730
the cartoon?

1530
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,300
I know where you're going.

1531
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:23,930
And I know what you're
about to do.

1532
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,660
And I know how it all ends up.

1533
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:28,830
But I need to get you
to do something first.

1534
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:41,660
This is where
I'm supposed to be.

1535
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,000
Mr. District Attorney,

1536
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:44,800
I'd like to introduce
you to Alan Gardner.

1537
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:46,360
The gentleman who
single-handedly stopped

1538
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,660
those three ruthless
home invaders.

1539
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:48,930
This is an honor,

1540
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,900
sir.
No, it's an honor
meeting you, sir.

1541
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:52,200
Please.

1542
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:55,000
I apologize for not being made
available to you sooner.

1543
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,500
I was a bit
under the weather.

1544
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:58,960
But I just wanted you to know
that this office stands ready

1545
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,060
to help you navigate whatever
legal hurdles your

1546
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,230
extraordinarily brave actions

1547
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:03,730
may have created
for you.

1548
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,960
Oh.

1549
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,110
Should I have brought

1550
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:09,250
my lawyer?

1551
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,010
Both the detective

1552
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:12,280
and Mrs. Dubois,
the other night,

1553
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:13,580
seemed to indicate
that... that...

1554
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:14,910
That shooting
three people to death

1555
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:16,310
to protect one's own life

1556
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:18,650
is a perfectly justifiable
course of action? Absolutely.

1557
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:20,950
So long as you can prove
that you were in mortal

1558
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:23,850
danger, you have nothing to fear
from the justice system.

1559
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:27,110
Well, is there any doubt
about that?

1560
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:28,580
Doubts? No.

1561
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:30,410
No doubts, but questions.

1562
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:31,980
There are always questions.

1563
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:33,850
There's quite a lot

1564
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,880
of valuable art in your
home, isn't there, sir.

1565
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:37,280
I own two art galleries.

1566
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:39,050
Of course there's art
in my home.

1567
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:41,380
You may have heard,
in addition to your home,

1568
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:44,310
and the two others in the
Phoenix area, two others

1569
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:46,880
in the Southwest were also hit.
Guess what they all had

1570
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:48,710
in common?
Every family that was

1571
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,850
targeted, owned at least
one major work of art.

1572
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,050
But I-I don't understand.

1573
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,310
I thought I read that
nothing had been taken from

1574
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:56,850
the homes.

1575
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,450
The papers never mentioned
anything about art being stolen.

1576
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,380
And it appears that none had,
but then...

1577
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,010
Mrs. Dubois here
developed a theory.

1578
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:05,950
Well, what if you could find
someone who could paint

1579
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:08,850
near-perfect copies
of modern masterpieces?

1580
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,250
You go into a home.

1581
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,610
You massacre everyone
who lives there.

1582
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:16,710
You replace the authentic
painting with the fake.

1583
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:21,010
Then while everyone is consumed
with the grief and horror

1584
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:24,080
you quietly sell the priceless
originals to wealthy collectors

1585
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:25,310
in the Middle East and Asia.

1586
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:27,480
Wow.

1587
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:30,180
You think that's
what's been going on?

1588
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:32,660
Well, that's the reason

1589
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,780
I brought that painting to you
yesterday.

1590
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:37,850
It came from the Costigan home
after the massacre.

1591
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,010
I was really hoping
to get your expert opinion

1592
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:41,780
as to its authenticity.

1593
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:43,210
Well, I'll sign anything.

1594
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:45,380
And happily testify under oath,
the painting you showed me,

1595
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:47,550
the one you said came
from the Costigan home,

1596
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:50,810
that's absolutely an original
Armand Vartanian.

1597
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:52,850
Easily worth at least
a million dollars.

1598
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,710
Maybe twice that, depending
on the appetite of the buyer.

1599
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:57,910
So much for your theory.

1600
01:17:57,950 --> 01:18:00,650
So you would be
willing to sign

1601
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:01,910
a sworn statement

1602
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:04,710
vouching for the painting's
authenticity?

1603
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:06,980
Well, I'd have no choice.

1604
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,710
Sorry about that.

1605
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:19,680
Mm.
I appreciate this.

1606
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:24,130
And let me present you
with this.

1607
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:25,700
And this is?
That...

1608
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:28,200
that's a search warrant.

1609
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:31,830
Actually, the detectives should
be arriving at your house

1610
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:33,100
right about now.

1611
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:34,730
To look for what?

1612
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:37,930
That painting
that I brought you yesterday--

1613
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,500
an old friend suggested,
before I gave it to you,

1614
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:42,560
that I mark it in some way.

1615
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,160
So, on the back,
where it would do no damage,

1616
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,860
I wrote the initials, "C.B."

1617
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,830
in indelible marker.

1618
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:51,560
That is the painting
that you gave back to me.

1619
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,130
And, yes, it's the real
actual painting.

1620
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,930
But it's not the painting
I brought to your house.

1621
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,160
No initials.

1622
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,100
The painting

1623
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:14,260
I brought to your house was the
one you had Olga Bankova paint.

1624
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:17,830
What are you suggesting?

1625
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:20,360
What are...
What are you talking about?

1626
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,400
Those home invaders

1627
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:23,560
worked for you,
Mr. Gardner.

1628
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,760
So did Olga.

1629
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,560
Although we're fairly
certain she had

1630
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,960
no idea what she vas involved
in until it was too late.

1631
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,100
When you realized I was going
to pay you a visit,

1632
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:32,730
you thought I might be
on to something.

1633
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:34,630
So you gave me
the authentic painting

1634
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:36,030
to throw me off the scent.

1635
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:37,860
This is preposterous.

1636
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,300
DEVALOS:
Really?

1637
01:19:39,330 --> 01:19:42,600
What about the part where you
suggested to your hired killers

1638
01:19:42,630 --> 01:19:45,130
that you needed them
to hit one more home-- yours.

1639
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,630
But, unlike everyone else,

1640
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,660
you weren't surprised when they
showed up-- you were waiting.

1641
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,360
You can't prove that.

1642
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,100
Oh, I think we can.

1643
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:56,360
What was your story--

1644
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,900
waiting at the top
of the stairs?

1645
01:19:57,930 --> 01:20:00,060
We think maybe you were
hiding at the bottom.

1646
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:02,230
DEVALOS:
According to ballistics,

1647
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:03,900
you shot those men in the back.

1648
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:06,060
Your dog, too.

1649
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:08,230
Now, if you'll

1650
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:10,830
excuse us, I need to give myself
a little insulin shot

1651
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:12,260
and I'd love a word with you.

1652
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,360
Detective, read this
man his rights.

1653
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,460
You have the right
to remain silent.

1654
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,260
Anything you say
can and will be

1655
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:20,930
(in distance):
used against you
in a court of law.

1656
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,700
Nice work, Allison.
I mean that.

1657
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:27,600
I'd like to think
if I'd been feeling better

1658
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:29,900
I might have listened
more and sooner.

1659
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:32,100
Don't worry about it.
It's no big deal.

1660
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:34,430
It wasn't just me;
I had a lot of help.

1661
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:35,460
Yeah, I know,
your daughter.

1662
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,460
The cartoons.

1663
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,430
Yeah, and an old friend.

1664
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:41,060
Well, thank him for me, too.

1665
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:44,330
Yeah, well, if I see him,
I will.

1666
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:50,060
ALLISON:
Some say sleep is the death
of each day's life.

1667
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:53,600
But I say sleep is the gateway
to our dreams.

1668
01:20:53,630 --> 01:20:57,400
And our dreams are the map
of our humanity.

1669
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:00,560
Ever watch a child sleep?

1670
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,160
They almost always smile.

1671
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:06,200
They know what's coming.

1672
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:07,730
And adults?

1673
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:11,260
Ever notice how we try to tidy
up our lives just before bed?

1674
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,200
Did you take your pills?

1675
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:21,160
Check your sugar?

1676
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:30,330
You die on me, I'll
never forgive you.

1677
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,400
Don't worry.

1678
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:36,130
I'm not going anywhere.

1679
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,960
Or what a disappointment it is

1680
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,700
when we're lurched out
of our sleep,

1681
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:47,800
(phone rings)
or our dreams,
by something unexpected.

1682
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,200
Scanlon.

1683
01:21:53,230 --> 01:21:55,160
Hi.

1684
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,300
Who is it?
Is it work?

1685
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:02,200
Uh...
Want me to go?

1686
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:04,230
No. It's okay.

1687
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:05,630
It's nothing. Wrong number.

1688
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:27,260
Hey, Al.

1689
01:22:29,530 --> 01:22:31,860
Allibaster.

1690
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:33,900
You know what I heard?

1691
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:37,430
That if I want it bad enough...

1692
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:39,900
if I try hard enough...

1693
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:43,460
sometimes, someone like me...

1694
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:47,130
can actually be felt...

1695
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,400
by someone like you.

1696
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:52,860
A great man once said,

1697
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:55,160
"If a little dreaming
is dangerous,

1698
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,100
"the cure for it
is not to dream less...

1699
01:22:58,130 --> 01:23:01,460
but to dream more."

1700
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:07,760
Did you think I was just going
to give up

1701
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,730
and let you dream this dream
without a fight?

1702
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:16,910
Dream all the time.

1703
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:20,110
Yeah, I'm for that.

1704
01:23:21,650 --> 01:23:28,650
