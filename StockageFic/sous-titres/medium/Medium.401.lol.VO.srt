1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,600
Can you tell
me what happened

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,200
<i>at the end of last
season of Medium?</i>

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,800
Oh, it was very...
It was a really nice story.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,300
Joe was held hostage.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,600
There was gunshots.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,800
<i>There were five of us
in that room.</i>

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,000
Only two of us
made it out alive.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,300
So he was told by his lawyer
that he could actually sue.

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,700
My name is Cooper Conroy.

10
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,400
I'm an attorney, Mr. Dubois.

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,400
Can you talk for a moment?

12
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,500
Talk about what?

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,000
About the millions of dollars
I believe you're entitled to.

14
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,600
What is this? It's a liability waiver.

15
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,400
So you're saying that if

16
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,400
I don't sign these,
I can't come back to work?

17
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,300
Allison was begging
Neve Campbell,

18
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,600
the reporter chick, not to print
the truth about her.

19
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,700
That reporter had to be, like,
a little snitch.

20
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,600
You cannot run this story!
Debra!

21
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,900
Please!

22
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,800
<i>What about
my life?!</i>

23
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,300
My husband's life?

24
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,100
My children's lives?

25
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,100
And now Allison's whole life is
in turmoil and in jeopardy.

26
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,800
Well, the press is after her.

27
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,700
Can you talk about
your relationship

28
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,100
as a spiritual advisor
to the district attorney?

29
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,400
Do you actually
talk to dead people?

30
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,100
Her boss is about this close
to losing his job.

31
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,200
This new D.A. came in,
started cleaning house,

32
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
and no one seemed to have wanted
Allison's services anymore.

33
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,700
I'd like you all to meet an
old law school buddy of mine,

34
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,600
Tom Van Dyke, Assistant
District Attorney

35
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,300
out of Flagstaff
and a good friend.

36
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,300
<i>Well, I went to work.</i>

37
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,000
<i>No Devalos.
He's just not there.</i>

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,000
<i>Turns out his friend
they brought in to help</i>

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,300
<i>is suddenly running the place.</i>

40
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,400
<i>He sends an assistant
overto me</i>

41
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,600
to tell me that my part-time
consulting services

42
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,200
probably won't be needed
for the foreseeable future.

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,800
Look, I understand
that Manny is in hot water.

44
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,600
I know you're on

45
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,800
thin ice where you are,

46
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,700
but neither of you
takes my calls?

47
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,800
Allison, Manny is on a boat
in the Gulf of Mexico fishing.

48
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,200
And as for you, what do you
want me to say? You're toxic!

49
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,300
Given the way
things are going,

50
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,300
nobody wants to
hear your dreams.

51
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,200
Nobody wants to hear

52
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,600
from Allison Dubois.

53
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,400
Now they both don't have jobs.

54
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
How are they going
to survive?

55
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,900
I don't know
what they're going to do.

56
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Yeah, I don't know.

57
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,400
Yeah, that makes
no sense to me.

58
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,400
No. We've been
negotiating this deal

59
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,300
for three
and half months.

60
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,800
Now he's insisting
we close it this second?

61
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,700
No. You can't
conference him in right now.

62
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,600
I'm with Ben.

63
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,900
What? Uh, hold on.

64
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,800
I'm losing you.

65
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Yeah. Hold on
a second.

66
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,200
Ben, come here, buddy.

67
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Dad?
Yeah, uh...

68
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,200
Fine. All right,
put him through.

69
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,700
Ben?

70
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,200
Uh, no, no, sorry,
Mr. Rivercott.

71
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,500
Can you just
give me one second, please?

72
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,500
Yes, Mr. Rivercott.
I'm here.

73
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,400
Yes, sir, and I'm ready
to do some business.

74
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,400
Well, if that's all
that's standing

75
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
between us and a deal, sir,
I'm sure we can...

76
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,900
Ben?

77
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,000
Ben? Buddy, can you hear me?!

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,900
Ben?!

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,400
Oh, God. Ben!

80
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,300
Ben?

81
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,500
Ben! Ben!

82
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,300
Ben!

83
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,600
Oh.
Oh.

84
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,900
What?

85
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,300
Did you say
something?

86
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Dream.

87
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,100
A little boy.

88
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,800
A kidnapping, I think.

89
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,800
Oh.

90
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,100
What are you
going to do?

91
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,400
Here. You want
to call someone?

92
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,500
There's no one to call.

93
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,800
Don't you reiember?

94
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,100
Oh, yeah.

95
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,500
I guess for a
minute there,

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,100
I was hoping that
was just a dream.

Oh, no, not again.

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Ugh!

102
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,900
We really need
to have a boy.

103
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,100
Mm...

104
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,800
And in the forecast-
oudy, windy and cold.

105
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,600
I'm just saying, I
don't think it's fair.

106
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,600
Fair? I don't think
it's about fair.

107
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,500
I mean, if what you're
saying is true, I'm sure

108
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,300
it's just 'cause they
want to know that

109
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,400
whoever they give the lead
role to can handle the pressure

110
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
and the
responsibility.

111
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,800
Being in a new school

112
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,000
and balancing that
with all the homework.

113
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,300
So you agree?

114
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,500
You think it's just fine that
because I'm in the ninth grade,

115
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,000
and it's my first
year in high school

116
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,200
that I shouldn't play the
lead in the school play?

117
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,100
Even though
it#s the perfect play for me

118
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,800
and it's the perfect role
for me and I'm perfect for it?

119
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Here, babe.

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's no good.

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,900
I'm sorry, baby.

122
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,100
That's all the peanut
butter we have left.

123
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,000
Mom,

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,100
what do you think?

125
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,400
What do I think?

126
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,500
I think just because all
the other kids are saying

127
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,000
ninth graders never get the
lead doesn't make it so.

128
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,600
I think you ought
to wait to see

129
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,900
that you didn't get the part
before you get all upset.

130
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,100
Great. Just my luck.

131
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,100
<i>When I'm in ninth grade,
they do The Sound of Music.</i>

132
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,200
And then, when I'm in tenth,

133
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,400
<i>they'll do The Wiz or
Dreamgirls. Just watch.</i>

134
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,500
Yeah, it's tough
looking like you.

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,200
And now authorities
and the young man's family

136
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,000
are asking for your help.

137
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh, no.

138
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,500
A $20,000 reward
is being offered

139
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,700
for any information leading
to the recovery of Ben Goldman,

140
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,200
and both the Chief of Police

141
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,800
and acting District Attorney
Van Dyke have pledged...

142
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,000
D.A.'s Office.

143
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,700
Of course, the election
is still several months away,

144
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,500
and just to put some things
in perspective,

145
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,100
only about 32% of the
eligible electorate

146
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,200
is even aware that there's
going to be an election.

147
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,300
But among those
that are,

148
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,000
slightly more than 70%
recognized your name,

149
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,200
and about half of them

150
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,500
indicated that
they were favorably disposed

151
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,600
to seeing you continue...

152
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,900
Excuse me a moment.

153
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,400
<i>Can you tell him</i>

154
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,100
it's about the
missing Goldman boy?

155
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,800
I- I think I may
be able to help.

156
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,300
I think I may
know some things.

157
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,300
As soon as he returns

158
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,000
to the office,
I'll give him the message.

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,400
And you have
all my num...?

160
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,700
<i>Boy and girls?</i>

161
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,300
Okay, I need
everyone's attention,

162
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,700
because today
we have a special guest.

163
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,200
So our mouths are closed
and our eyes and ears are open.

164
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,300
And now-
and this is pretty exciting-

165
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,100
I'm going to introduce
a real, live police detective.

166
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,100
From our very own Phoenix
Police Force, let's welcome

167
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,300
Detective...

168
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,600
Is it, uh, Scanlawn?

169
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,200
Scanlon.

170
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,400
I feel like
I'm having a nervous breakdown.

171
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,500
Who am I speaking with?

172
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,800
It's Allison.
It's Allison Dubois.

173
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,100
Uh, please don't hang up.

174
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,900
I know you're not supposed
to take my calls.

175
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,500
I know I'm persona non grata.

176
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,300
Allison, we've been
through this.

177
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,500
I had a dream
about the Goldman boy.

178
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,900
I called the District Attorney's
Office.

179
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,400
I left Van Dyke a message.

180
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,200
I know he's never going
to call me back.

181
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,000
I called the Phoenix P.D.
I can't get a detective

182
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,100
to take my call.

183
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,700
I don't know what to tell you.

184
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,000
Well, I have to do something.

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,500
I can't see what I see,
know what I know,

186
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,200
and not do anything with it,
not tell anyone.

187
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,200
I can't go buy peanut butter and
pretend that I didn't see it.

188
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,800
Allison, they've got me doing
public relations now.

189
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,700
I'm about the furthest thing

190
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,600
there is
from a homicide detective.

191
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,900
You are the closest thing
to a homicide detective I know.

192
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,500
Tell me what you saw.

193
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,200
It happened in a toy store.

194
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
They already know that.

195
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,700
He used a doll, a marionette,

196
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,200
to lure the boy.

197
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,500
Allison, none
of this stuff matters.

198
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,600
It has to matter.

199
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Why would I see it?

200
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,100
Why would someone bother

201
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,000
to show it to me
if it didn't matter?

202
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,300
Did you see him?

203
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,100
Did you see the man
who took the boy?

204
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,700
Not from the front.

205
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,200
He was wearing a...
green jacket.

206
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,500
A green denim jacket.

207
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,200
All right, fine. Green denim.

208
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,900
I'll tell someone.

209
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,400
Whether they listen,
whether they care-

210
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,800
I can't control that.

211
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,100
Hi.

212
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,300
Have a seat.

213
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,700
Last time you applied
for unemployment benefits?

214
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,300
God.

215
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,800
Uh, sometime in the eighties.

216
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,800
Hmm.

217
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,900
Um...

218
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Engineer?

219
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,500
Aerospace.

220
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,400
So, um, what are we
doing to find work?

221
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,800
I'm sending out
letters of inquiry.

222
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,800
I'm, you know, calling friends
and going to conferences.

223
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,000
It's tough because

224
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,100
there are really only
two other aerospace companies

225
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,500
in the area that do the work
in the fields

226
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,300
that I specialize in, so it's...

227
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,200
I got three kids in school,

228
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,300
so we-we really don't want
to leave the area.

229
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,700
You're in a
tough spot.

230
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,300
Made good
money, too.

231
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,900
Never see it
coming, do you?

232
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,000
"Dubois. "

233
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh, my goodness.

234
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,700
Dubois?

235
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,200
I take that back.

236
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,700
Maybe you did
see it coming.

237
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,700
I mean,

238
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,600
maybe your
wife did anyway.

239
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,300
$111.80.

240
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,700
All right. Thanks.

241
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,700
Oh, ma'am, that
card's being denied.

242
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,800
Do you have
another card?

243
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,800
No, I-I don't need another card.

244
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,400
There's a mistake.

245
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,100
I know this card's good.

246
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
I just paid the bill
a couple weeks ago.

247
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,900
Is there a problem?
I have things I need to do.

248
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,700
There's no problem.

249
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,000
We're just
sorting something out here.

250
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,400
Okay, ma'am, that card's just
going to keep being denied.

251
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,200
And if you swipe
it one more time,

252
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,400
I'm just going to get a message
to take it away from you.

253
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,400
You got cash?

254
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Well, not enough
for all this stuff.

255
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,300
Okay.

256
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,100
All right, let's just figure
out what you really need, okay?

257
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,500
<i>My name? Rolen.</i>

258
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,300
Allison Rolen.

259
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,300
Uh, I think I may have
some information ???

260
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,800
$240 a week.

261
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,800
You work for the same
company 15 years.

262
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,400
The government takes thousands
of dollars every month,

263
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,400
and then when you get fired,

264
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,300
when you can't get work,
they give you $240 a week.

265
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,200
And act like you really ought
to be ashamed of yourself

266
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
for even asking for it.

267
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,400
The guy at the
unemployment office

268
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,100
recognized our last name.

269
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,200
He knew about you.

270
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,300
Oh...

271
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,800
Maybe I should take
Marie out of preschool.

272
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,900
I'm home now.

273
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,500
It's not like
she has to be there.

274
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
No, don't do that.
We're not there yet.

275
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,800
Hell, haven't you
been listening?

276
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,700
I just got us $240 a week
to blow on anything we want.

277
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,400
Oh.

278
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,000
* You see I go by the code
Of the doctor of the mix *

279
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,700
* These reasons
I'll tell ya why *

280
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,000
* You see I'm six foot one
I'm tons of fun *

281
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,000
* And I dress to a "T"

282
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,600
* You see I got more clothes
than Muhammad Ali *

283
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
* And I dress so viciously *

284
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,900
* I got bodyguards,
I got two big cars *

285
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,800
* That definitely
ain't the whack *

286
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,200
* I got a Lincoln Continental
and a sunroof Cadillac *

287
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,600
* So after school,
I take a dip in the pool *

288
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,400
* Which is really on the wall *

289
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,400
* I got a color TV so I can see
the Knicks play basketball *

290
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,000
* Hear me talk about checkbook

291
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,300
* Credit card, more money... *

292
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,000
Hey, what is it?

293
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,000
Why are you
breathing so hard?

294
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,800
What'd you see, hmm?

295
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,600
He's white.

296
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,200
Or at least
his feet are white.

297
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,800
What I think he's doing
to that little boy...

298
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,500
Is there anyone to call?

299
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,600
Is there anything to do?

300
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,700
No.

301
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,800
SCANLON
What's that, Bobby, a joint?

302
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Two wrongs don't
make a right, Bobby.

303
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,200
I know, they make a left.

304
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,900
Just say "no. "

305
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,500
Eat me, stupid.

306
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,200
Haven't you heard?
Drugs are bad.

307
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,300
Puppets.

308
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,300
They, uh...

309
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,600
they want me to try
'em with the older kids.

310
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,400
Third graders.

311
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,600
I hate my life.

312
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,100
You're still a detective.

313
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,600
What are you talking about?

314
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,700
What it says on my badge?

315
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,300
No. Yes.

316
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,500
If you think you know something,
if you think you can help...

317
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,000
I don't know anything.
But you said Allison Dubois

318
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,100
called you with... With nonsense,
with nothing that matters.

319
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,800
She told me that it
happened in a toy store.

320
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,100
The father told us it
happened in a toy store.

321
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Said the guy was wearing
a green denim jacket.

322
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,400
Besides, I'm on Romper
Room duty. It's not my case.

323
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,500
Make it your case.

324
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,800
Go to the store.
Look around.

325
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,500
Flash your badge.
Talk tg people.

326
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,600
You're not listening.
I'm on the Reefer Madness tour.

327
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,700
<i>You're not listening,
after hours.</i>

328
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,300
Look at the crime
scene photos.

329
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,600
Go see the family.

330
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,900
People don't get irate
because there are

331
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,600
too many cops asking questions.

332
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,900
Tell them the mayor's
office sent you.

333
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,100
<i>Tell them I sent you.</i>

334
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,600
You don't get it.
This new D.A...

335
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,400
Let me handle the new D.A.

336
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,400
*... six foot one
And I'm tons of fun *

337
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400

344
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,100
Hello?

345
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,600
WOMAN
Allison Rolen?

346
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,700
I'm... sorry,
may I ask who's calling?

347
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,000
This is Ameritips.

348
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,300
You called our 800 number
and left us some

349
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,500
information about ???

350
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,700
I'm following up.

351
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,200
My name is Cynthia Keener.

352
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,300
Uh, right, um...

353
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,600
What can I do for you?

354
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,000
Actually, I was wondering
if we could meet.

355
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,600
You could come
to our Phoenix office,

356
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,400
or I could come to your home.

357
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,200
Do we really have to meet?

358
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,100
Well, I do need to follow up.

359
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,300
I guess it really depends
if you're serious.

360
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,000
Serious about the information
you gave us.

361
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,500
Serious about the reward.

362
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Uh, right, the reward.

363
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,700
I completely forgot.

364
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,400
I really don't feel comfortable
meeting at my home.

365
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,800
You know the Scottsdale Fashion
Square Mall?

366
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,000
How about we meet
in the food court?

367
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,800
Say tomorrow at 11:00?

368
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,700
Okay.

369
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,900
How will I recognize you?

370
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,900
Don't worry, I'll find you.

371
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,900
That's what I do for a living.

372
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,900
Hey, girls!

373
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,400
Come on, hurry up!

374
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,500
Daddy's going to pick up Marie

375
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,000
and Bridgette
and meet us at home.

376
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,700
Hannah, honey, do you
need a ride home?

377
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,300
Oh, my God!
I got called back

378
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,700
for Maria this afternoon!

379
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,600
Oh, my God!
I know!

380
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,500
Hey.

381
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
You nervous?

382
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,000
Terrified.

383
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,500
Look at her.

384
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,900
Brooke Greene?

385
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
I know her.

386
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,600
Yeah, well...

387
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,300
she's in the tenth grade,
and I hear she's amazing.

388
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,600
She's perfect for this.

389
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,300
I don't stand a chance.

390
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,100
Hey, the idea is to psych
her out, not yourself.

391
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,000
Never mind.

392
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,300
Hey, Brooke.

393
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,300
Hi, Hannah.
What's going on?

394
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,300
I just...

395
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,600
I know you're going
out there in a minute,

396
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,300
and I don't want you
to get rattled.

397
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,300
Rattled bx what?

398
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,800
Ariel's mother
is out there.

399
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,300
Okay.

400
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,700
And you know who
she is, right?

401
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,500
Yeah.

402
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Well, she's Ariel's mother.

403
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
And the thing is,
she already knows

404
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,300
her daughter's
getting the part.

405
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,400
I mean, that's why
she's sitting out there.

406
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,000
I just...

407
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,800
I didn't want you to see her
and have it mess you up.

408
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,300
Brooke Greene? You're on.

409
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,000
Thing is, we just closed,
and it's pouring out.

410
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,100
Couldn't we do this
another time?

411
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
I mean, come on,
you guys were here

412
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,700
for two days. My
employees are still crying

413
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,200
about all the
wages they lost.

414
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah, well,
the store's closed now,

415
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,400
and no one's losing a dime.

416
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,900
How about you just
take 20 minutes

417
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,100
and walk me through it?

418
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
What's in this direction?

419
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,900
Two bathroom doors, both locked,

420
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,600
employees lounge and lockers,

421
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,800
warehouse space
for additional inventory.

422
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,500
Other cops already
been through it twice.

423
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Yeah, well,
you know what they say.

424
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,500
Third time's a charm.

425
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,100
Who do you say
you work for again?

426
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,100
The Mayor?

427
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,200
That's what I said.

428
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
I hate him.

429
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh, don't tell me
we have a leak.

430
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,700
I just had this damn roof
re-tarred a month ago.

431
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,900
You use red tar?

432
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,200
What are you talking about?

433
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,100
What's above us?

434
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,600
Toys, what do you think?

435
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,600
Who's up here?

436
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,700
Someone's up here!
It's the mice.

437
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,400
When it rains
they come inside.

438
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,700
It's the mice.

439
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Am I above the spot
where that drop hit me?

440
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,800
You gotta go
towards the rail.

441
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,800
Hey, hey, take it
easy up there!

442
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,600
I gotta sell that stuff.

443
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,400
He's not here.

444
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,600
Is he?

445
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,900
What are you
talking about? Who?

446
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,100
I don't know.

447
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,300
I think I was asleep.

448
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,200
Then I felt it.

449
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,000
His head on my chest.

450
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,300
He was lying on top of me.

451
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,800
And it was so real.

452
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,200
I mean, I...

453
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,800
I could smell his hair.

454
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,500
Why doesn't someone call?

455
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,900
Ask for ransom?

456
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,600
Or the the police?

457
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,500
Why don't the police call?

458
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,800
Someone.

459
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,100
I think he's gone.

460
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,600
I think he just came to me...

461
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,200
said "good-bye. "

462
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,200
I think that's what it was.

463
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,100
What? What is it?

464
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,400
He's dead.

465
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,500
I think the little
Goldman boy is dead.

466
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
No... I don't
think so, honey.

467
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,200
I just got into bed.

468
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,500
I just got done
watching the news.

469
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,800
They didn't say
a word about it.

470
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,700
What are you
talking about?

471
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,400
It's the middle
of the night.

472
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,200
No, Allison, it's 11:45.

473
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,000
You went to bed
just after 10:00.

474
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,500
I stayed up to
watch the news.

475
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,500
I'm telling you.

476
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,200
Who you calling?

477
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,600
I'm calling Scanlon.

478
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,000
Maybe he knows something.

479
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,200
Hello?!

480
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,500
I'd like to speak
with the officer in charge.

481
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,400
Hello?!

482
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,400
Would someone point me towards
the lead detective, please?

483
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,500
That would be me.

484
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,600
You?

485
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,900
You found the boy?

486
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,700
I was unaware

487
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,300
that you were even assigned
to this case, Detective.

488
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,500
Some friends in
the mayor's office

489
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,900
asked me to look into it.

490
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,800
Kind of like an
after school project.

491
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,200
Who knows?

492
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,800
Who else knows about this?

493
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,700
Just me and the
store manager.

494
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,900
Coroner's on his way.

495
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,900
Other than that...

496
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,900
You haven't spoken
to any press?

497
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,500
I called your office,

498
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,800
the District
Attorney's Office.

499
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,900
That's the protocol.

500
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,100
That's what I did.

501
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,900
This boy's parents
are in a lot of pain.

502
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,100
I'd like to try to
keep this under wraps

503
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
for another 12 hours or so,

504
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,700
at least until the
coroner and forensics

505
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,100
have had a chance
to take a look.

506
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,100
Maybe generate some clues,

507
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,100
get us closer to the
animal who did this.

508
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
I think that would make
this a much easier pill

509
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,800
for the parents to swallow.

510
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,500
For everyone to swallow.

511
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,600
Certainly make
for a better story in the press.

512
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,200
Can I count on your
discretion, Detective?

513
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,300
Can I sleep on it?

514
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,900
No. Not unless you plan
on sleeping alone.

515
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,900
Let's keep your
girlfriend out of this.

516
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,600
I'm tired mf her calls
on your behalf.

517
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,200
I need to know if
I can count on you.

518
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,300
I don't know what to tell you.

519
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,900
It's after midnight and I have
to get up in five hours

520
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,700
to talk to a group
of student crossing guards

521
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,900
about the importance
of walking on the green

522
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,700
and not in between.

523
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Really?

524
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,100
I'm sure I could
find somebody else

525
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,400
to take care of
that for you.

526
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,300
A valuable man like you, you
should be out in the field.

527
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
A valuable man like you

528
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,100
should be leading
investigations for my office.

529
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,700
It's not here.

530
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,700
What's not there?

531
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,700
Something I was
sure would be.

532
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,800
<i>So now you're
the star of the play?</i>

533
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
It's high school.

534
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,900
There are no stars, but...
I'm the lead.

535
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,000
Cool.

536
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,500
Do you know where Daddy is?

537
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,100
No, I agree with you, Mom.

538
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,100
Yes.

539
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,900
No, I agree with Oprah.

540
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,800
In a civilized society,
women should wear underwear,

541
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,200
particularly
if they're public figures,

542
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,900
getting out of cars,
being photographed.

543
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
Mom...

544
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Yeah, Mom... Mom. Mom.

545
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,800
I need to borrow some money.

546
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,300
<i>Allison Rolen?</i>

547
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,100
Have I made a mistake?

548
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,400
Cynthia Keener.

549
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,600
Ameritips.

550
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,500
Allison?
Hi.

551
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,500
I thought I was going
to meet you ten minutes

552
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
at the food court.

553
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,300
Oh, I just, well, um...

554
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,500
I was early,
and I saw you standing there.

555
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,800
At Least I thought it was you
standing there.

556
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,900
I'm kind of intuitive that way.

557
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,600
Is-is this all right?

558
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,400
I'd be happy to wait till 11:00.

559
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,000
Oh, this is fine,
this is fine.

560
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,500
I know it sounds so ancient,
but I wanted to be a nun.

561
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,200
You just don't hear that
anymore, but I did.

562
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,900
I wanted to wear a habit

563
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,700
and sit in the front row
Christmas mass,

564
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,800
get mentioned in
Father's sermons.

565
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,100
So I took temporary vows of
poverty, celibacy and obedience.

566
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,500
And I don't know what happened
to the vows of poverty

567
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,000
and celibacy,
but it soon became very evident

568
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,200
that I had no talent whatsoever
for obedience.

569
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,600
So, then I decided to go
into the family business,

570
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,900
become a cop.

571
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,800
I went to college,
I studied criminology.

572
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,100
Me, too.

573
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,500
Back then, for a woman,

574
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,500
it was... tough.

575
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,100
Anyway, I saw an
ad for Ameritips.

576
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,100
And I've been an investigator
with them for 20 years.

577
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,600
And I got my wish-

578
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,700
I'm poor, I'm celibate,

579
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,300
and I don't have to
listen to anyone.

580
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,000
How many people phoned in
about the Goldman boy?

581
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,600
We logged about 1,400 calls.

582
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,500
1,400 calls?

583
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,200
Most of those
are cranks

584
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,400
and others are people fishing
for the reward money.

585
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,400
The credible ones
really jump out at you,

586
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,300
which is why I'm here.

587
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,300
"Green, denim jacket. "

588
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,900
That's rather
specific, isn't it?

589
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,000
Of course, it's not
the kind of clue

590
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,700
that's going to
get you a reward.

591
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,900
Oh, I don't care
about the reward.

592
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,300
I don't care about the money.

593
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,200
The money would be good-
it would be great- but...

594
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,800
I really can't get
that little boy out of my mind.

595
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,400
I know what you mean.

596
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,900
This is a ground floor
plan of the toy store

597
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,000
where the Goldman
boy was abducted.

598
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,600
I wonder if you
wouldn't mind

599
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,900
indicating with the
cursor where you were

600
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,100
when you saw the
man take him.

601
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,300
What do you mean?

602
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,100
Well, the "X" here
is where Mr. Goldman said

603
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,000
his son was standing
the last time he saw him.

604
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,700
And this green "X" here
is the position of the father.

605
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,900
Where would you have been?

606
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,500
I mean, you would have had
to have been fairly close

607
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
to see that the jacket
was denim.

608
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,700
Were you in the store at all,
Allison?

609
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,600
Enjoy your iced tea.

610
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,700
You should Google me.

611
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,800
My married name is Dubois.

612
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,900
Allison Dubois.

613
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,800
D- U-B-O-I-S.

614
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,200
I know what I'm talking about.

615
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,400
The jacket is green.

616
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,500
And the man who took him?

617
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,600
He likes to dance.

618
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,700
And...

619
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I think the little boy is dead.

620
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,100
You think the
little boy is dead?

621
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,900
Well, I work for the parents,

622
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,500
and I think I would know
if the little boy is dead.

623
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,900
I think you're one of the
cruelest people I've ever met.

624
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,500
Well, I'm not trying to be.

625
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I saw his spirit
visit his parents last night.

626
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,700
You saw?

627
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,100
Look me up.

628
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,700
It's on your computer.

629
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Right there
for all the world to see.

630
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

631
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,300
Bridge.

632
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,100
Catch a tiger by the toe.

633
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,200
I know what I want for
Christmas. If he hollers...

634
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,500
I want my own room.

635
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,200
...let him go.

636
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,400
What are you doing?

637
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,500
Choosing who's going
to take me to school.

638
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,100
Well, now that you guys
don't have to be anywhere

639
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,200
in the morning...

640
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
I miss work.

641
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,300
Me, too.

642
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,500
<i>What do you mean</i>

643
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,200
there's no evidence, Detective?

644
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,900
This, this little boy's body
is covered with evidence.

645
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,200
He is drenched in blood.

646
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,100
Was he shot? Was he stabbed?

647
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,300
Poisoned.

648
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,500
Forced to ingest something-
we don't know what yet-

649
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,500
that very rapidly brought
on massive dehydration,

650
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,600
all the fluid in his
body is just gone.

651
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,100
The skin tissue is nothing
but a hard crust.

652
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,900
The blood you see there
came from his eyes,

653
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,800
his nose, his mouth,
and his anus.

654
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,300
That's enough, Detective.

655
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,800
We're gonna begin
reinterviewing

656
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,600
all the store employees
this morning.

657
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,900
I'm hoping
that fairly soon

658
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,100
the lab will be able to tell us
the exact nature of the poison.

659
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,900
That should certainly help
point us towards

660
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,400
whoever might have done this.

661
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,500
I don't think we can keep
a lid on it much longer.

662
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,100
I know you're not looking
forward to calling the parents.

663
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,700
I'm just afraid if we don't...

664
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,000
Too many people are aware-
cops, lab technicians-

665
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
for the media not to find out.

666
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,100
We don't have a single clue?

667
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,000
We don't have a single lead
on who this might be?

668
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,000
Well, there is one, but it's...

669
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,100
not much to hang your hat on.

670
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,400
I'm not even sure
if it's credible.

671
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,100
I need something for the press.

672
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,900
He may have been wearing
a green, denim jacket.

673
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,100
You found a fiber?

674
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,900
Allison Dubois had a dream.

675
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
Sir?

676
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
I'll, uh, call the parents,

677
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,500
I'll notify the media
the boy is dead.

678
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,100
There are no leads
at the present time.

679
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,900
<i>This shocking news just in.</i>

680
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,100
The Coroner's office confirming
that the body of Ben Goldman,

681
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,900
that young boy reported missing
since last week,

682
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,300
was apparently discovered by
authorities sometime yesterday.

683
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,800
Details of the discovery are not
being shared with reporters,

684
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,100
nor is there
any press conference scheduled

685
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,200
at this time.

686
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,000
* I need someone *

687
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,400
* Older and wiser

688
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:56,600
* Telling me what to do

689
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,900
* You are 17

690
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,600
* Going on 18 *

691
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,400
* I'll *

692
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,400
* Depend *

693
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,500
* On you. *

694
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,100
I could never do that.

695
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,500
What are you talking about?

696
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,200
You have the part.

697
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Yeah...

698
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,100
but nobody was more surprised
than I was when it happened.

699
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,600
I was sure
it was going to be you.

700
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,100
What?

701
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,300
Your mother didn't tell you?

702
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,400
Tell me what?

703
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,400
She seemed to think
you knew.

704
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,800
She seemed to think
you dreamt it

705
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,900
and made it so.

706
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,700
There was no use
in even trying...

707
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,900
Well, I didn't dream it.

708
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,000
The first I heard about you
being called back was

709
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,900
when you told me.

710
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,900
The first...

711
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,700
I heard about you
getting the part was

712
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,900
when you got it.

713
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,200
Mom, this girl
is Maria.

714
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,400
Hi, Mom.

715
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,800
Hey!

716
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,700
I thought you guys were
here the whole time.

717
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,800
Daddy let us play
at the park

718
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,800
until the Police came
and kicked us out!

719
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,500
Turns out the place closes
at dark,

720
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,800
which makes no sense to me.

721
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,400
Where are High School kids
supposed to go

722
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,100
and do the things
they can't do at home

723
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,400
if the park is closed?

724
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,300
Dad!

725
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,400
Did you grab the mail?

726
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah.

727
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,200
Why, you expecting
something?

728
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,100
I thought maybe
Mom... Grandma...

729
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,600
might have sent
me something.

730
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,000
Oh, what?

731
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,200
Joe?

732
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,700
I asked her
for a loan.

733
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,500
I tried to
convince her

734
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,000
it was gonna be cheaper
than bail.

735
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,700
Oh, Joe...

736
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,800
She said she was gonna
think about it.

737
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,000
Talk to her
accountant.

738
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,100
I guess I was just
kind of hoping

739
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,100
that her answer would
be in the mail.

740
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,800
It's the mice.

741
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,300
When it rains
they come inside.

742
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,300
It's the mice!

743
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,600
Am I above the spot
where that drop hit me?

744
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,100
You gotta go
towards the rail.

745
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,100
Hey, hey!

746
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,200
Take it easy
up there!

747
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,800
I gotta sell
that stuff!

748
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,900
Come on, pick up your phone.

749
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,100
Allison, it's
barely 6:00.

750
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,500
He's probably
sleeping.

751
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,900
The nut.

752
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,200
I don't know.

753
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,500
He's not taking my calls lately.

754
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,100
He hasn't been returning
them either.

755
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,000
Hi. This is
Detective Lee Scanlon.

756
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,800
Leave a message
and I'll call you back.

757
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,500
I mean, what is it
that you want him to say?

758
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,900
What is it that you
want him to tell you?

759
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,900
I mean, you dreamt
the boy was a mouse.

760
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,400
But clearly... he's not a mouse.

761
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,200
Well... it means something.

762
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,700
Who you calling now?

763
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,900
DiNovi.

764
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,600
Lynn? It's Allison.

765
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,300
I need to speak
to him.

766
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,600
Um, he's not here.

767
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Yeah, he left a half hour ago.

768
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,700
He's at the toy store.

769
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,300
They're reinterviewing
all the employees

770
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,800
before the place opens
this morning.

771
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,800
You want the address?

772
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,900
Now the last time
you spoke to police

773
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,000
you mentioned that you
do open the store

774
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Mondays and
Thursdays

775
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,500
and that therefore
you do have a key.

776
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,900
Is that correct Mr...

777
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,700
Mr. Kaye?

778
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,400
There's a lady here
to see you.

779
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,700
Detective,

780
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,600
I'm Cynthia Keener.

781
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,900
I'm an investigator
with Ameritips.

782
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,100
Well...

783
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,100
you're here early.

784
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,000
Didn't expect to see you

785
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,700
till rehearsal this afternoon.

786
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,400
Actually, that's
why I came by.

787
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,700
I need you to listen
to something.

788
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,300
What do you mean?

789
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,400
You want to sing something
for me?

790
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,700
Not exactly.

791
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,400
Brooke?

792
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,000
<i>Now, Mr. Kaye,</i>

793
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,200
obviously, what we
need from you is

794
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,000
someone to corroborate
your whereabouts

795
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,600
for the 24 hours prior tk the
discovery of the Goldman boy.

796
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,000
You have
another visitor.

797
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,400
A mouse?

798
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,100
It means something.
I'm sorry.

799
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,300
Not to me. Neither does
the green denim jacket

800
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,300
or the dancing.

801
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,100
I don't know what to tell you,
Allison,

802
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,400
but you can't hang around here.

803
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,300
I'm just starting to get some
traction with the new D.A.

804
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,600
If he finds out you were here... Fine.

805
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,900
Maybe you could do me a favor.

806
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,100
Maybe you could give me a call
when you're done with all this.

807
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,300
Or maybe, uh...

808
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,100
maybe you could pick up
the phone when I call you.

809
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,500
I could probably swing that.

810
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,800
I miss Devalos.

811
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,300
Me, too.

812
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,000
* Girls in white dresses

813
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,000
* With blue satin sashes

814
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:29,900
* Snowflakes that stay
on my nose and eyelashes *

815
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,100
* Silver white winters

816
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,100
* That melt into springs... *

817
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,400
I don't understand.

818
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,400
When we get back home...

819
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,600
what are we gonna do?

820
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,900
What are you gonna do?

821
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,300
I don't know.

822
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,600
I'm not sure.

823
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,100
I just can't spend
another day waiting

824
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,900
for permission
to be who I am.

825
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,800
I'm a lawyer.

826
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,700
I practice law.

827
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,200
It's all I really know.

828
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,000
And if I can't do it
for the people,

829
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,900
I'll open up my own office.

830
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,100
I'll start my own practice.

831
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,800
* These are a few
of my favorite things *

832
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,000
* Raindrops on roses

833
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,900
* And whiskers on kittens *

834
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:29,200
* Bright copper kettles
and warm woolen mittens *

835
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:36,900
* Brown paper packages tied up
with strings... *

836
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,700
Miss Heath...

837
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,200
apparently you also
have a key.

838
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,200
* These are a few
of my favorite things... *

839
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,400
What the hell is that?
Who...

840
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,400
Somebody unlocking
the warehouse door.

841
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,500
* When the dog bites *

842
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,200
* When the bee stings

843
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:10,600
* When I'm feeling sad... *

844
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,900
Well, I don't
understand.

845
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,600
I thought everyone who had
keys to the building

846
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,900
were here this morning.

847
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,400
Well, yeah.

848
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,800
Everyone
who works for us.

849
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,300
Oh.

850
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,700
Sorry.

851
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,800
You, you guys having a meeting?

852
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,900
Nobody told me.

853
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
And you are?

854
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,300
Oh, the exterminator.

855
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,400
We have a contract.

856
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,900
Put some poison out
the other day.

857
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,800
I'm just back
to pick up the mice.

858
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,200
The mice?

859
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,000
Mice.

860
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,800
Rats.

861
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,500
They've had a real problem
with them.

862
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,300
See, I put the poison out
a couple of nights ago.

863
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,900
But thing is,
once they eat that stuff,

864
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,800
it makes them really stiff
and bloody.

865
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So you really want
to get rid of them

866
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,300
before it starts
to smell,

867
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,800
and it gets
into the air-conditioning.

868
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,200
Is it okay? I...

869
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,600
I won't make too much noise.

870
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,700
We should question him.
He has a key.

871
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,500
Uh, you know what?

872
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
I left my gloves
in my other jacket.

873
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,400
I just gonna run
to my truck.

874
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,400
Uh, you mind if I come with?

875
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,600
Yeah.

876
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,700
A little bit.

877
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Who the hell are you?

878
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,900
I'm a detective
with the Phoenix Police force.

879
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,200
I'm investigating the murder
of a young boy.

880
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,100
I- I'd like to ask you

881
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,300
some questions.

882
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,200
* I simply remember... *

883
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,800
What was the color
of that other jacket?

884
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,000
Was it green?

885
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,000
* My favorite things

886
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,200
* And then I don't feel... *

887
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:52,100
* So bad! *

888
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,300
Hello.

889
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,500
Green denim jacket.

890
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,700
He was doing
a little dancy thing

891
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,100
when he first walked
in the room.

892
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,900
Exterminator.

893
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,700
Which I guess explains
the mouse.

894
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,400
So what are you doing?

895
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,300
Me, I'm just, uh...

896
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,300
I'm paying bills.

897
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,600
Well, no, actually...

898
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Lee, someone's at the door.

899
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,500
This guy Van Dyke-
he's an idiot.

900
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,200
Let me try and talk to him
about you.

901
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,800
Let me see
if we can't get you back here...

902
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,300
at least part-time.

903
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,800
Raally. So they making snowballs
in hell now?

904
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,100
Lee, let me call you back.

905
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,700
I Googled you.

906
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,900
Apparently I owe
you an apology.

907
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,300
$2,500?

908
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,400
This is a personal check.

909
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,700
This is your check.

910
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,500
Why are you doing this?

911
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,500
I couldn't get you
the reward.

912
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,400
Um, you didn't find him-

913
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,100
I mean, your clue didn't
really find him-

914
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,900
but I thought

915
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,800
maybe we could
keep in touch.

916
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,200
Perhaps come to some sort
of an arrangement.

917
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,900
Not between you
and Ameritips,

918
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,600
but between you and me.

919
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,800
I'm an investigator,

920
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,900
and someone
like you...

921
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,100
I have a feeling

922
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,100
that we could do each other
a lot of good.

923
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,600
And as I mentioned
the other night,

924
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,900
I'm really quite intuitive, too.

925
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,700
I'll be calling.

926
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,100
