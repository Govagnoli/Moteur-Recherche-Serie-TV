1
00:00:10,586 --> 00:00:11,484
Are you all right?

2
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:15,929
I'm kind of a nervous flier.

3
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:18,458
I sensed that.

4
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,611
Can I tell you a few things?

5
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:23,087
Might calm you down a bit.

6
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:25,623
I used to be a flight attendant.

7
00:00:26,128 --> 00:00:28,713
When you're up here-- 35,000 feet--

8
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:32,328
it's, like, the safest place you can be.

9
00:00:32,794 --> 00:00:34,147
It's safer than in your car.

10
00:00:34,652 --> 00:00:36,123
Safer than in your bathroom.

11
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:38,810
Yeah, I know that.

12
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:40,899
You're talking logic.

13
00:00:41,852 --> 00:00:44,929
And what's in my head has nothing to do with logic.

14
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:50,627
- It's nothing.
- I hate that.

15
00:00:51,278 --> 00:00:53,976
It's air. It's like a bump in the air.

16
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:56,387
Like a boat going over a small wave.

17
00:00:56,617 --> 00:00:57,581
You want that.

18
00:00:57,842 --> 00:00:59,342
You want air under the wings.

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,755
There's that logic again.

20
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:03,828
Folks, I've just been informed by air traffic control

21
00:01:03,883 --> 00:01:07,520
that we're flying into some nasty weather and to expect some pretty good chop,

22
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,153
so I'm flipping on the fasten seat belt sign and

23
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,405
at this time, I'd like to ask our flight attendants to take their seats as well.

24
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:15,137
Oh, boy.

25
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:23,053
It's going to be okay. I promise you.

26
00:01:27,476 --> 00:01:31,450
I don't understand. Why can't he fly around it, or above it?

27
00:01:32,604 --> 00:01:33,392
Oh, God!

28
00:01:34,707 --> 00:01:36,585
Now I'm going to tell you a secret.

29
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:38,593
Nothing's going to happen.

30
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:40,379
Nothing can happen.

31
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:41,654
I know it.

32
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:43,078
I'm certain of it.

33
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:44,158
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:47,087
- How do you know that?
- I'm four months pregnant.

35
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:51,055
I can't be hurt. I'm invulnerable.

36
00:02:02,008 --> 00:02:05,539
- You okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

37
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,511
Wow. I can hear your heart beating from over here.

38
00:02:11,345 --> 00:02:13,404
So what's playing tonight, World War III?

39
00:02:13,523 --> 00:02:14,284
No.

40
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,992
Unstoppable microbes spreading disease throughout the world and killing entire populations?

41
00:02:20,137 --> 00:02:20,889
No.

42
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:22,999
The Yankees back in the pennant race?

43
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,373
It was an airplane crash. It was horrible.

44
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:27,872
Sorry.

45
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,501
Did you actually see it go down?

46
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:32,849
No, I woke up just before it.

47
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:35,281
Well then, maybe...

48
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:37,370
Maybe.

49
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:41,404
Do you think you can sleep some more, or do you want to get up?

50
00:02:41,486 --> 00:02:42,388
I don't know.

51
00:02:43,104 --> 00:02:46,582
Just... I don't know, hold me for a second.

52
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,598
Can I tell you something that might calm you down?

53
00:02:57,876 --> 00:03:01,076
When you're up there-- 35,000 feet-- it's, like, the safest place you can be.

54
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:04,215
It's safer than in your car, safer than in your bathroom.

55
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:09,002
Don't take this personally, but could you maybe not say anything?

56
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:12,269
Okay.

57
00:03:57,109 --> 00:03:59,164
Up and at 'em. Rise and shine.

58
00:03:59,496 --> 00:04:01,808
I smell delicious cold cereal.

59
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:04,043
Boy, you don't want to be late for that.

60
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,350
Where's Mommy?

61
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,533
Oh, the D.A. called. Something's going on.

62
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,791
He needed Mommy to come into work early this morning.

63
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:16,710
Do you want me to wake up Marie?

64
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:18,426
No, no, no, you let her sleep.

65
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,446
So what'll it be? I'm cooking Pebbles, Loops or Puffs.

66
00:04:21,507 --> 00:04:22,249
Puffs.

67
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,091
You're in luck. I got a batch coming out of the oven right now.

68
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:27,463
- Morning Daddy!
- Morning, Bridge.

69
00:04:30,094 --> 00:04:32,291
So, uh, what's that you got on your head there?

70
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:35,977
That's her new bicycle helmet. Mommy bought it for her yesterday.

71
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:37,262
She slept in it.

72
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:39,673
- Pebbles, Loops or Puffs?
- Loops.

73
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:42,991
- Don't I look cool?
- Yeah, absolutely. The coolest.

74
00:04:43,309 --> 00:04:46,546
But, you know, normally, we don't eat, or for that matter, sleep

75
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:49,947
with our hats, and especially our bicycle helmets on.

76
00:04:50,304 --> 00:04:52,034
You want me to help you get it off?

77
00:04:52,186 --> 00:04:54,833
- Daddy...
- Okay. Got it. Fine.

78
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,682
Keep the helmet on for breakfast.

79
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,621
But I mean, it's not like you're going to go to school in it.

80
00:05:03,017 --> 00:05:04,792
You want milk on those Loops?

81
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:09,564
His wife's been missing going on 72 hours.

82
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:11,898
Comes home from work, no note.

83
00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:15,053
Her car's not there, but nothing from the home seems to be missing.

84
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:19,558
No luggage, no clothing. Her toiletries and medications are where she always keeps them.

85
00:05:19,604 --> 00:05:21,437
It's not like she packed for a trip or anything.

86
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:24,505
I think I heard him on the radio just now, driving over here.

87
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:26,343
He was pleading for her to come home.

88
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,071
- He... He sounded frantic.
- I think he is.

89
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:30,495
We think he is.

90
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,631
His alibi is airtight.

91
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:34,644
He left the house for work at 4:00.

92
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:39,184
Two separate neighbors have come forward to say they saw the wife leave the house around 5:15.

93
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:40,500
So what am I doing here?

94
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,260
What can I say? I'm an old dog.

95
00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:44,760
Whenever one of these disappearing wife situations comes up,

96
00:05:44,806 --> 00:05:47,355
I feel like a fool if I don't suspect the husband.

97
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:48,180
But...?

98
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:52,040
But, frankly, I can't find a single reason to doubt this guy's story.

99
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:54,456
But you were hoping maybe I would?

100
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,625
Well, we were hoping that you would sit with him.

101
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,945
Give us the benefit of your opinion.

102
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:01,999
It's not like we have a whole lot else to go on.

103
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:04,319
No crime scene, no body.

104
00:06:04,391 --> 00:06:06,095
We're already doing everything we can.

105
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:09,003
We've alerted the police departments to be on the lookout for her car.

106
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,481
The bank is standing by, waiting for any credit card activity.

107
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:14,969
We've even got the cell phone provider to alert us if she makes a phone call.

108
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:18,193
I told him you work with me, that these kind of situations are your specialty.

109
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:24,533
Those are sort of boiler plate things we say to people in missing persons cases.

110
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,913
Things to get the conversation started.

111
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:29,591
Does he know he's a suspect?

112
00:06:30,482 --> 00:06:31,485
But he's not.

113
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:33,877
Does he know we're suspicious?

114
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:37,477
He doesn't strike me as a stupid man.

115
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,508
Well, obviously, any current pictures would be helpful.

116
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,128
And if she has a phone book or a PDA, we could start calling everyone.

117
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:49,806
We could see if she's reached out to anyone.

118
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:53,282
Who knows? Maybe she's just visiting a friend, or...

119
00:06:53,348 --> 00:06:54,301
Are you married?

120
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:55,433
Yes.

121
00:06:57,245 --> 00:06:58,361
You ever do that?

122
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:01,408
Just go off and visit a friend--

123
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:03,676
not tell your husband, not tell anyone?

124
00:07:05,212 --> 00:07:08,325
I'm sure you've been asked this a hundred times, but

125
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:10,300
do you mind telling me what happened?

126
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:15,867
But I don't know what happened.

127
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:17,355
That's why I'm here.

128
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:20,403
No, I... I mean, from your perspective.

129
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:22,344
How did you discover she was gone?

130
00:07:27,628 --> 00:07:29,256
Can you not just read this somewhere?

131
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,397
16 different people have taken my statement already.

132
00:07:33,628 --> 00:07:36,455
I... I feel like we're wasting time.

133
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:38,589
She's out there somewhere. She could be hurt.

134
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:43,490
- She could be...
- It would really be helpful if I could hear it from you.

135
00:07:45,204 --> 00:07:48,912
Yes, of course it would. I knew that.

136
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:50,160
- I know that.
- Mr. Call...

137
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:53,929
The sooner you... The sooner you rule me out, the sooner--

138
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:56,355
- Mr. Call... 
- No-- the sooner you can move this along.

139
00:07:57,022 --> 00:07:57,727
I get it.

140
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:00,602
This bird's not moving until you run it, so let's run it.

141
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:01,855
Excuse me?

142
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:05,224
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's...

143
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:09,478
It's just sky jockey talk. It's something that we say at work.

144
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,293
You're a pilot?

145
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:12,581
Yes, ma'am. Sunbeam Air.

146
00:08:13,528 --> 00:08:14,594
They didn't tell you?

147
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:17,046
Sunbeam, huh?

148
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:19,022
You fly out of Phoenix?

149
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:22,141
Yes, round trip to Cleveland three times a week.

150
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:28,183
Folks, I've just been informed by air traffic control that we're flying into some nasty weather,

151
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:31,840
and to expect some pretty good chop, so I'm flipping on the fasten seat belt sign

152
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,546
I'd like to ask our flight attendants to have a seat at this time, too. Thank you.

153
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:44,705
I can't be hurt.

154
00:08:45,294 --> 00:08:46,768
I'm invulnerable.

155
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:59,266
Oh, no, no, man, no. Not today. Not on my anniversary.

156
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:00,752
Pull back on that yoke!

157
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:03,373
I'm pulling, there's just nothing there!

158
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:10,557
Checklist says to just keep pulling back on that yoke.

159
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:16,966
What the hell are you doing?

160
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,113
Shutting it all down.

161
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,952
Then we'll fire it back up again.

162
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:22,871
God, what did you do?! You're gonna drive us right into the earth!

163
00:09:28,604 --> 00:09:30,274
- We're dead!
- I don't think so.

164
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:31,477
Oh, my God!

165
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:43,663
Okay.

166
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:50,072
I told you so.

167
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,203
Ma'am?

168
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:54,420
Ma'am, are you okay?

169
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:57,609
Excuse me, ma'am. Are you okay?

170
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,951
- You all right?
- Oh. I'm fine, I'm sorry.

171
00:10:02,457 --> 00:10:03,247
Okay.

172
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:07,434
What can tell you? How can I help? How can I help move this along?

173
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:11,741
Can I ask you a question... about flying?

174
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,211
Excuse me?

175
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,750
About flying. About being a pilot.

176
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:20,271
Would you mind if I ask you-- Have you ever had any close calls up there?

177
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:23,475
Ma'am, what does this have to do with my wife?

178
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:24,629
I'm not sure.

179
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:35,411
No.

180
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:38,718
I mean, no.

181
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,649
No, I... I blew out a tire on a landing in Salt Lake City one time,

182
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:46,121
but that's about as bad as it's ever gotten for me.

183
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,541
Do you mind if I ask you, when is your anniversary? Your wedding anniversary?

184
00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:52,860
Are you serious?

185
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:55,348
Oh, I'm sorry.

186
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:57,708
I didn't mean to pry.

187
00:10:58,184 --> 00:11:00,361
- I can look it up.
- It's next week, actually.

188
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:03,499
March 31.

189
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:07,596
31st... of March.

190
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,025
Thank you.

191
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:14,907
This has been very helpful.

192
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:20,037
You're a very odd woman.

193
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:25,849
I'm afraid that I don't understand.

194
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:29,949
I had a dream last night about a plane crash.

195
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:31,957
At least, it looked like it was about to crash.

196
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:34,339
But it didn't, and now I know it never will.

197
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,626
Because it turns out Mr. Call in there--

198
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:37,875
Captain Call--

199
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:39,785
he's the pilot.

200
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:43,790
And he pulls the plane out of a dive before it goes down.

201
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:45,781
I see. And when does this happen?

202
00:11:45,848 --> 00:11:47,875
Could be in a week. Could be a year from next week.

203
00:11:47,936 --> 00:11:50,968
- All I know is it hasn't happened yet.
- And how do you know that?

204
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:53,779
'Cause he told me-- not directly--

205
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:57,254
but I asked him if he ever had a close call as a pilot, and he said "no."

206
00:11:57,752 --> 00:12:00,101
Okay, I must be the slowest guy in the room.

207
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:04,592
So tell me again, one more time, how this dream you had proves that fellow didn't kill his wife?

208
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:05,678
Think about it.

209
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:09,175
He can't be sitting in the cockpit of a jet, ready to save a plane,

210
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,177
if he's in jail for murdering his wife.

211
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:12,328
That doesn't prove anything.

212
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:13,471
Right, not directly.

213
00:12:13,674 --> 00:12:17,336
But the fact that I see him do this, the fact that it hasn't happened yet,

214
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:20,587
means that it's something that's going to happen in the future.

215
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:24,698
And in order for it to happen in the future means he doesn't go to jail.

216
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,103
And that would suggest that he didn't do anything.

217
00:12:30,136 --> 00:12:31,345
Help me out here, Manny.

218
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,468
Don't ask me. I don't have a clue.

219
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:37,918
Well, I do, and I'm telling you this man had nothing to do with his wife going missing.

220
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:38,563
Fine.

221
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:42,141
Neither one of us necessarily disagrees with your conclusion...

222
00:12:42,214 --> 00:12:46,340
Another thing. Wherever she is, she's still alive, and she's going to stay that way.

223
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:48,788
Well, that's great news.

224
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:50,216
Are you sure?

225
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:53,272
All I can tell you is... whenever that plane starts going down,

226
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,639
they're still celebrating wedding anniversaries.

227
00:12:57,312 --> 00:12:59,514
Looks like you and I have a missing wife to find.

228
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:14,168
Oh, my God.

229
00:13:15,146 --> 00:13:17,384
This time, it's me having a scary dream.

230
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:19,626
- What do you mean?
- Well, look at you. It's morning.

231
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:23,420
You're not waking up from some apocalyptic vision with your heart pounding.

232
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:24,838
And you're smiling.

233
00:13:26,446 --> 00:13:28,131
It's got to be a dream.

234
00:13:28,227 --> 00:13:29,733
Actually, I slept through the night.

235
00:13:30,373 --> 00:13:31,683
I'm getting chills.

236
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:35,688
I think the only possible explanation is for the first time in a long time...

237
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:37,629
I'm content.

238
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,746
Hmm. "First time in a long time"?

239
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:43,957
Does that mean up to now, our marriage has been a fraud?

240
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:46,071
No, I'm not talking about us. I mean in here.

241
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:50,934
I feel like I, like I accomplished something.

242
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,967
Like I... I contributed something.

243
00:13:55,882 --> 00:14:00,045
I helped redirect everyone's attention on where it needed to be.

244
00:14:00,193 --> 00:14:04,938
Finding that woman and bringing her home so that she and her airline pilot husband

245
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:09,007
could live happily ever after, and he could fulfill his destiny

246
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:12,855
by helping that plane and those passengers through that horrible calamity.

247
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,153
Boy, it doesn't take much to make you content.

248
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:19,526
Avert one minor disaster, and there's no getting that goofy grin off your face.

249
00:14:25,004 --> 00:14:28,767
Now, listen, I don't mean to burst your "all's right with the world" bubble,

250
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:30,985
but did you happen to notice anything unusual last night

251
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:32,337
when you kissed Bridgette good night?

252
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:33,493
No, not really.

253
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,981
She didn't look a little like a crash test dummy to you?

254
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:37,759
What are you talking about?

255
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:40,937
Did you not notice the bicycle helmet on her head?

256
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,114
She's been wearing it for two days straight now.

257
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:45,433
- And...?
- Morning, Mommy. Morning, Daddy.

258
00:14:45,722 --> 00:14:47,031
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

259
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:49,008
Good morning, sweeties.

260
00:14:50,743 --> 00:14:53,591
I really sleep good in this new bike helmet.

261
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,414
All right.

262
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,497
Don't you think it's a little strange? Don't you think it's a little peculiar?

263
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:04,322
Don't you think when you have a child who's unique and doesn't make friends easily...?

264
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:05,192
And...?

265
00:15:05,756 --> 00:15:09,012
Don't you think we should discourage anything that appears overly... eccentric?

266
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,209
This is a bad dream.

267
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:12,919
It's okay; she's okay. It's normal.

268
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,674
She does this all the time.

269
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:15,862
You're just not aware of it.

270
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,510
Last time, it was the SpongeBob underwear.

271
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:21,935
I had to wash them every night so she could wear it the next day for, like, a week and a half.

272
00:15:22,002 --> 00:15:24,050
And before that, it was her ballet slippers.

273
00:15:24,142 --> 00:15:27,659
She insisted on wearing them to school, in bed, in the bath.

274
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,770
I mean, trust me. Leave it alone; it will pass.

275
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:33,911
Well, I'm sorry, I'm not sure we should leave it alone.

276
00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:36,190
I'm not sure we shouldn't sit down and talk with her.

277
00:15:38,156 --> 00:15:38,852
Morning.

278
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:40,976
Yeah, she's right here.

279
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:41,899
It's your boss.

280
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,197
Hello.

281
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:47,663
Wow, that is good news.

282
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,834
Um, I'd love to meet you there,

283
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,709
but I have to see if I can get someone to take the kids to school this morning,

284
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,037
and I can.

285
00:15:55,605 --> 00:15:57,437
Okay, so I'll see you in 45 minutes.

286
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,347
Trust me.

287
00:16:07,961 --> 00:16:10,120
This was exactly the break I was hoping for.

288
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,359
As soon as we went public with the fact that she was missing

289
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:16,705
and started to publicize her license plate number, I knew it was only a matter of time.

290
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:18,886
Once this shopping mall parking lot emptied out last night,

291
00:16:18,953 --> 00:16:22,082
somebody realized this car had been sitting here in the same spot a couple of days.

292
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:24,690
Then they compared the license plate with the one in the paper.

293
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:29,582
Hey, we're out of here.

294
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,218
The seats, the steering wheel, the dash-- everything's wrapped in plastic.

295
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,153
We'll keep working on the car when it gets to the impound.

296
00:16:34,231 --> 00:16:36,012
- It's all yours, Mr. District Attorney.
- Thanks.

297
00:16:36,565 --> 00:16:39,290
No purse, no cell phone, no signs of a struggle.

298
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:42,766
Whoever took her knew her, and wasn't leaving anything behind.

299
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:45,601
If there were no signs of a struggle, how do you know someone took her?

300
00:16:47,968 --> 00:16:48,710
Have a seat.

301
00:16:53,718 --> 00:16:54,941
Mrs. Call is five-two.

302
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:56,324
So am I.

303
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:57,993
How we doing with the pedals over there?

304
00:16:58,765 --> 00:17:00,527
Perfect. Absolutely perfect.

305
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:01,863
Now check your mirrors.

306
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:07,972
Well, I can't see anything but the ceiling in the rearview mirror...

307
00:17:08,892 --> 00:17:11,423
and the passenger side view is no help, either.

308
00:17:11,484 --> 00:17:12,447
Do you know why?

309
00:17:13,143 --> 00:17:15,032
Whoever drove the car was taller than Mrs. Call,

310
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,398
but smart enough to put the seat back to her original position.

311
00:17:17,474 --> 00:17:18,811
Just forgot about the mirrors.

312
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:23,102
Let's close the driver's door again so I can check the side view mirror, just to be sure.

313
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:35,334
What do you see? It's screwed up, right-- the mirror?

314
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,296
Allison, hey, you're not even looking at the mirror.

315
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:04,923
Three-three-one-two...

316
00:18:05,282 --> 00:18:06,845
zero-zero-three.

317
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:09,764
One-one-two-three-

318
00:18:10,068 --> 00:18:11,604
one-eight-nine-three.

319
00:18:11,685 --> 00:18:12,634
Open the door!

320
00:18:13,418 --> 00:18:15,092
- Write this down.
- Write what down?

321
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:19,100
Three-three-one-two-zero-zero-three.

322
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:22,459
One-one-two-three...

323
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:24,901
one-eight-nine-three.

324
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,343
- One-one-two-three...
- ...one-eight-nine-three.

325
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:29,168
What the hell is that, the next winning lotto numbers?

326
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:32,546
That's where he took her. That's the latitude and the longitude of where he took her.

327
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,309
Joe?

328
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:45,780
Hey, what's up?

329
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:47,456
God, where are you calling from?

330
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,058
It sounds like you're coming from the moon.

331
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,712
Actually, I'm in the middle of the desert.

332
00:18:51,116 --> 00:18:54,106
I started to get a good fix on where Call's wife might be,

333
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:56,461
so the DA, Detective Scanlon and I,

334
00:18:56,627 --> 00:18:59,074
and a couple of state troopers are headed out there.

335
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:01,141
Well, that's great news, isn't it?

336
00:19:01,802 --> 00:19:02,995
Yeah, I don't know.

337
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:05,171
She's dead, Joe.

338
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,560
Does her husband know?

339
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:12,251
No, not yet. Nobody knows. I didn't tell anybody.

340
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,998
What do you mean? Why?

341
00:19:14,357 --> 00:19:17,702
Why? 'Cause yesterday, I was sure that she was alive.

342
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:21,449
Yesterday, I was sure that her husband was innocent.

343
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:24,453
Now I'm starting to think I was wrong about all of it.

344
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:26,142
Uh, hold on a second, Allison.

345
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:27,771
Aren't you putting the cart before the horse?

346
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:30,403
Why don't you just wait and see what you find out there in the desert.

347
00:19:30,489 --> 00:19:32,608
Maybe she's fine; maybe everything's fine.

348
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:34,156
Yeah.

349
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,502
Right.

350
00:19:36,418 --> 00:19:37,156
Maybe.

351
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:03,089
I guess I'm not sure I know what we're looking for.

352
00:20:03,764 --> 00:20:05,597
A shack? A car?

353
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,756
Do we maybe want to rethink this? Double-check our numbers?

354
00:20:15,557 --> 00:20:16,415
Allison.

355
00:21:13,828 --> 00:21:15,718
Allison, you okay? Everything all right?

356
00:21:16,095 --> 00:21:16,847
Yeah.

357
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,590
No!

358
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:21,584
She's here.

359
00:21:22,608 --> 00:21:24,299
She's buried right here.

360
00:21:33,384 --> 00:21:37,036
Folks, I'm going to ask the flight attendants to take their seats for a couple of minutes here.

361
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:38,724
We're heading into some rough weather,

362
00:21:38,935 --> 00:21:40,978
but I guarantee you we'll get you through it.

363
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:44,665
And we'll let you folks know just as soon as we get through this turbulence here, okay?

364
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:49,109
Damn. It's getting rough up here.

365
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:54,182
What the...?

366
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:02,652
Pull back on the yoke.

367
00:22:03,978 --> 00:22:05,535
Elevators aren't responding.

368
00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:11,925
Oh, my God. Oh, my god.

369
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,456
Mayday!

370
00:22:15,672 --> 00:22:17,304
Mayday! Mayday!

371
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,203
A little cold over here.

372
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:29,690
I'm sorry.

373
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,369
I was in the middle of a plane crash.

374
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,789
It was that same flight.

375
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,177
Cleveland to Phoenix, but this time,

376
00:22:39,913 --> 00:22:42,511
Call wasn't the pilot. It was this other guy, and...

377
00:22:44,456 --> 00:22:46,269
that guy did the wrong thing, and...

378
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,415
the plane went down.

379
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,518
All the people died.

380
00:22:52,475 --> 00:22:53,864
It was a dream, Al.

381
00:22:54,528 --> 00:22:56,004
But what does it mean?

382
00:22:56,484 --> 00:22:58,267
I don't know, babe, 

383
00:22:58,687 --> 00:23:00,349
but it's the middle of the night.

384
00:23:07,861 --> 00:23:13,242
I want to thank everyone in the community for their support and their prayers.

385
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:16,319
What went through your mind when you first got the call that she'd been found?

386
00:23:16,401 --> 00:23:19,566
You know... I-I don't want to answer that.

387
00:23:20,645 --> 00:23:22,309
But you know what I do want?

388
00:23:23,617 --> 00:23:28,403
I want her to be remembered for the wonderful person that she was.

389
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:31,220
I want her to be remembered for her life.

390
00:23:31,352 --> 00:23:34,860
It would be an unspeakable tragedy if the only thing that people remembered,

391
00:23:34,921 --> 00:23:38,279
the only thing people that spoke of, was the fact...

392
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:43,195
that this... monster snatched her from us.

393
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:47,286
Um, obviously, this is a very difficult time for all of us.

394
00:23:48,115 --> 00:23:50,670
My wife's parents both passed away last year...

395
00:23:52,078 --> 00:23:52,800
and now this.

396
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:55,033
Are there plans for a memorial?

397
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:57,637
If people want to send flowers and condolences?

398
00:23:57,982 --> 00:24:02,015
Instead of sending flowers, what would be really wonderful is

399
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:06,869
if they could make donations to the Youth Outreach Project of Downtown Phoenix.

400
00:24:08,396 --> 00:24:11,309
My wife was very committed to her volunteer work there.

401
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,242
And, uh, as for the service, uh...

402
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:18,406
there's no date set as of yet.

403
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,746
Actually, I just...

404
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:24,458
want a little... time to go by.

405
00:24:25,921 --> 00:24:28,262
Our wedding anniversary is next week.

406
00:24:29,762 --> 00:24:31,722
It would've been next week.

407
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:33,991
March 31st.

408
00:24:35,347 --> 00:24:37,089
We would've been married two years.

409
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:46,335
I just want a little... little time to go by.

410
00:25:48,661 --> 00:25:52,891
Oh, uh, hello, Mrs. Dubois, from the District Attorney's office.

411
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:56,142
I'm sorry to show up so early in the morning on such a difficult day.

412
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:57,565
Oh, no, no, no, it's okay.

413
00:25:57,852 --> 00:25:59,603
It's good. It's... actually, it's good.

414
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:06,658
I... I, uh, overslept, and I'm expecting a delivery here any minute, so it's, uh... it's good.

415
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:11,579
Um, anyway, I, uh, I-I wanted to thank you.

416
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:15,387
I heard from the police that you were somehow involved in...

417
00:26:15,521 --> 00:26:19,689
in finding Marcia-- my-my wife's... body.

418
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:25,060
When I think about where she was, I mean... we might never have found her.

419
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,468
It might've been months.

420
00:26:28,327 --> 00:26:30,672
So, um... anyway, thank you.

421
00:26:30,748 --> 00:26:34,076
That's the reason I drove over here. I-I couldn't sleep last night,

422
00:26:34,132 --> 00:26:36,259
and I was watching you on television,

423
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:39,800
and you were talking about how it would've been your anniversary next week.

424
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,036
And I noticed the most peculiar thing...

425
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:44,732
The latitudinal coordinates.

426
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,384
Do you know what I mean by that?

427
00:26:48,797 --> 00:26:51,408
Yeah. I'm a pilot. Yes.

428
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:57,413
Well, the latitudinal coordinates of where we found you wife's body...

429
00:26:58,048 --> 00:27:03,307
Three-three, dot, one-two, zero, zero, three.

430
00:27:04,244 --> 00:27:07,168
Those are the exact same numbers in the exact same order

431
00:27:07,786 --> 00:27:09,768
as the date of your anniversary,

432
00:27:10,151 --> 00:27:12,533
if you were to express that date numerically.

433
00:27:12,682 --> 00:27:16,218
March 31, 2003.

434
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:22,594
Three, 31, two, zero, zero, three.

435
00:27:24,631 --> 00:27:26,962
Mr. Call? Okay if we bring these in?

436
00:27:29,076 --> 00:27:31,881
Excuse me. People will be coming over.

437
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:33,741
They'll be paying their respects.

438
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:35,553
- Oh, oh, I...
- Yes, come on in.

439
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,354
- By all means...
- Just do it. Why don't you just...?

440
00:27:38,154 --> 00:27:41,301
Set those up in the, uh, living room, please. Thank you.

441
00:27:46,955 --> 00:27:49,402
I'm not sure I know where you're going with this.

442
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,130
I'm not necessarily going anywhere. I just thought it was peculiar.

443
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:54,563
I thought it was interesting.

444
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,240
Well, forgive me, but I think you're peculiar.

445
00:28:00,626 --> 00:28:04,926
My wife is dead. And I just think it is just completely odd for you

446
00:28:04,972 --> 00:28:07,533
to come driving all the way over here at the crack of dawn

447
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,358
to point out some weird numeric coincidence to me.

448
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,561
Okay? I mean, are you one of these people that thinks there's some relationship

449
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:18,782
between 9/11 and dialing 911 to call the police?

450
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:22,079
Mr. Call, I'm going to need you to come out and count some chairs

451
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,719
and tables and glass and china and then sign the inventory list.

452
00:28:24,808 --> 00:28:25,597
Okay.

453
00:28:27,092 --> 00:28:28,356
I'll be right back.

454
00:29:14,654 --> 00:29:15,813
Thank you, Mr. Call.

455
00:29:15,978 --> 00:29:18,252
We'll be back in a couple days to pick up everything.

456
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:21,994
And by the way, we're all really sorry about everything.

457
00:29:22,287 --> 00:29:24,088
Thank you. I appreciate you saying that.

458
00:29:26,713 --> 00:29:27,586
Is there anything else?

459
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,262
Have you, uh, discovered any other odd factoids

460
00:29:30,323 --> 00:29:33,974
that might further diminish my wife's memory and trivialize her death?

461
00:29:34,046 --> 00:29:37,159
No. I'm terribly sorry if I upset you.

462
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,314
I'm sure you are.

463
00:29:39,949 --> 00:29:41,848
If you don't mind, I have to get ready.

464
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:43,707
People will be coming over.

465
00:29:56,226 --> 00:29:58,110
Girls, come on! Time's a-wastin'!

466
00:30:01,147 --> 00:30:03,129
Wow! Look at you.

467
00:30:03,415 --> 00:30:04,505
What's the occasion?

468
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:06,410
It's Picture Day, Daddy.

469
00:30:06,563 --> 00:30:08,991
Everybody in school is getting their picture taken.

470
00:30:09,145 --> 00:30:11,873
Picture Day. Cool. I love Picture Day.

471
00:30:12,094 --> 00:30:12,959
Ready!

472
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:22,062
What's the problem? Why are we all standing here?

473
00:30:22,475 --> 00:30:23,813
It's Picture Day.

474
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:25,395
We don't want to be late.

475
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:32,938
Bridge, come on. You and I need to have a little talk.

476
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:39,561
Are you going to cancel Christmas?

477
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,353
Bridge, honey.

478
00:30:43,085 --> 00:30:45,603
It's March. Christmas is a long way...

479
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:48,265
Nobody can cancel Christmas.

480
00:30:48,354 --> 00:30:49,982
I don't want to talk about Christmas.

481
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:52,506
I want to talk about Picture Day.

482
00:30:52,696 --> 00:30:53,458
Okay.

483
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:57,389
Well, you know, Picture Day is really important.

484
00:30:57,549 --> 00:30:59,920
Every year, you get these pictures taken,

485
00:31:00,048 --> 00:31:04,995
and that's your picture for that grade, for that year, for all time.

486
00:31:05,787 --> 00:31:06,657
Okay.

487
00:31:07,338 --> 00:31:10,575
And that's the picture we're gonna send to friends at Christmas

488
00:31:10,646 --> 00:31:14,645
and Grandma in Florida and hang on the refrigerator.

489
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:15,659
Okay.

490
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,607
And I want everyone to see your pretty face and your beautiful eyes

491
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:21,383
and your wavy hair, you know?

492
00:31:22,842 --> 00:31:25,699
So what do you say maybe you leave the bike helmet at home today?

493
00:31:30,716 --> 00:31:34,178
You know, Daddy, you can cancel Christmas, if you want.

494
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:35,565
It's okay with me.

495
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,088
What are you doing here?

496
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:43,917
I thought Daddy was taking you to school.

497
00:31:44,086 --> 00:31:47,409
He's talking to Bridgette about her h-e-l-m-e-t.

498
00:31:47,486 --> 00:31:48,121
Oh, no.

499
00:31:48,321 --> 00:31:49,221
Oh, yes.

500
00:31:50,383 --> 00:31:51,751
Hey, I remember you.

501
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,981
You left me a note in the middle of the night?

502
00:31:55,197 --> 00:31:56,369
It's good to see you again.

503
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,633
Hi, Mommy!

504
00:31:59,053 --> 00:32:00,957
Hi, Lambchop.

505
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,329
You look beautiful.

506
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,081
You both look beautiful.

507
00:32:04,478 --> 00:32:07,053
Hey, guys, do me a favor. Go wait in the car.

508
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,672
I'll be out in a second.

509
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:15,635
- One morning I ask you to cover me.
- One?!

510
00:32:15,702 --> 00:32:17,065
- One morning!
- Second time this week!

511
00:32:17,156 --> 00:32:18,979
- After years of "I've got to work late."
- I have a job, too.

512
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:21,145
- "I got to work this weekend, babe."
- Maybe I'm not out there saving the world

513
00:32:21,202 --> 00:32:23,321
- from bad dreams and bogeymen, but you know what?
- And I would think, I would hope, you would assume

514
00:32:23,378 --> 00:32:25,042
- what I was doing is pretty damn important.
- I have a job, too,

515
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:27,385
and one of those jobs is to be Bridgette's father.

516
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:30,949
I am entitled to an opinion on things like how she looks.

517
00:32:31,047 --> 00:32:33,238
It's her class picture, for goodness sake.

518
00:32:33,378 --> 00:32:36,019
I would have thought, out of deference to me, out of some sort of consideration

519
00:32:36,074 --> 00:32:38,794
for the fact that we're all going to have to look at this for the next 50 years,

520
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:44,182
that maybe, maybe you could stop indulging her eccentricities and take a stand!

521
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:45,618
Except, I think you like it!

522
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:47,698
Well, you know what, I do like it.

523
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:49,987
I do like it, and you want to know why?

524
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:53,775
Because those pictures are supposed to capture how they really look,

525
00:32:53,877 --> 00:32:57,604
who they really are, before they change, before they're gone.

526
00:32:57,968 --> 00:33:01,019
And today, who she really is is a little girl

527
00:33:01,076 --> 00:33:04,252
who's in love with the way that a red helmet looks on her head.

528
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:07,251
And that's great. 'Cause that's who she is!

529
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:08,265
Today!

530
00:33:09,597 --> 00:33:11,930
Just relax! She's not getting married in it.

531
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:14,583
What am I doing?

532
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,062
I haven't slept. I haven't had any coffee.

533
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:19,933
The kids are sitting in the car. I got to get the baby, take everyone to school...!

534
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,875
Hey, hey, hey, I'll do that.

535
00:33:21,941 --> 00:33:23,871
Oh, no, no, no. Please, I wouldn't want to interrupt you.

536
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:26,293
You're very busy "woe is Joeing."

537
00:33:28,867 --> 00:33:30,404
You want to hear something funny?

538
00:33:31,013 --> 00:33:34,163
I was racing back home hoping that you would still be here,

539
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:38,427
'cause I had this crazy idea that I needed to talk to you.

540
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,398
That you would help me sort this all out.

541
00:33:41,576 --> 00:33:44,714
That you could help me figure out my-- what did you call it?

542
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:48,627
My bogeyman and my... bad dreams?

543
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,750
All right, it was a bad choice of words.

544
00:33:52,762 --> 00:33:53,586
I'm sorry.

545
00:33:55,757 --> 00:33:57,811
What do you want to talk about? What do you want to sort out?

546
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,534
If you knew that 200 people were going to die, and you could prevent it...

547
00:34:05,912 --> 00:34:07,740
So far, this is not a tough question.

548
00:34:07,856 --> 00:34:13,377
No, but it meant that you had to compromise everything that you believe in,

549
00:34:13,623 --> 00:34:18,419
and that you would have to let a guy go who committed an unspeakable act...

550
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:21,779
...what would you do?

551
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,419
I'll get the baby. We'll drive the kids together.

552
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:28,767
You can drop me off at work and explain this to me on the way.

553
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:36,257
Well, if you're convinced he's guilty, you have to go to Devalos.

554
00:34:36,344 --> 00:34:37,441
I'm not sure I should.

555
00:34:37,554 --> 00:34:38,556
What-What are you talking about?

556
00:34:39,626 --> 00:34:41,941
My dream last night. I think I know what it means.

557
00:34:43,046 --> 00:34:45,438
That plane crashed when Call wasn't flying it.

558
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:48,167
If Call goes to prison, he won't be the pilot.

559
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,615
And hundreds of people will die? Is that what you're saying?

560
00:34:52,074 --> 00:34:54,997
You realize that's an absurd assertion, don't you?

561
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:57,530
You can't control the future.

562
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:00,834
The future is subject to hundreds and billions of variables,

563
00:35:00,911 --> 00:35:02,887
almost none of which are in your control.

564
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:05,721
- I know what I saw.
- What you dreamt, darling.

565
00:35:05,902 --> 00:35:08,181
And how many times have you thought a dream means one thing,

566
00:35:08,222 --> 00:35:10,633
only to discover that it meant something completely different?

567
00:35:10,854 --> 00:35:12,840
I mean, isn't that how we got here in the first place?

568
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,106
- This time I know.
- No, this time, again, you assume.

569
00:35:15,202 --> 00:35:17,190
Just like the last time, when you assumed,

570
00:35:17,252 --> 00:35:20,169
because you saw him fly the plane, that he must innocent.

571
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:24,596
Just like you assumed that when he mentioned an anniversary, that his wife must be alive.

572
00:35:24,674 --> 00:35:27,649
And now you're assuming that because you dreamed this plane crash,

573
00:35:27,731 --> 00:35:30,787
that somehow it's your responsibility-- --no, your duty--

574
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:33,910
to turn your back on the one thing that does seem reasonably certain:

575
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,779
That this man killed his wife.

576
00:35:35,845 --> 00:35:37,782
But what about all those people? What about that plane?

577
00:35:37,843 --> 00:35:40,213
What about that woman he buried in the desert?

578
00:35:40,387 --> 00:35:44,468
What about the way he used the date of their anniversary to choose a place to dump her?

579
00:35:44,945 --> 00:35:47,694
What about her family and their grief?

580
00:35:47,882 --> 00:35:49,342
And what about justice?

581
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:54,073
You're willing to turn your back on all of that for something you're afraid might happen?

582
00:35:54,524 --> 00:35:56,895
I'm sorry, honey, that doesn't sound like justice to me.

583
00:35:56,976 --> 00:35:58,517
That sounds like cowardice.

584
00:36:08,005 --> 00:36:12,137
So he had the means, and he had the motive.

585
00:36:12,357 --> 00:36:15,527
What we need is a piece of physical evidence that ties him to...

586
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:16,945
Well, hello, stranger.

587
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:20,461
We were just comparing notes on your friend Captain Call. You all right?

588
00:36:22,006 --> 00:36:22,827
Do you need me?

589
00:36:24,023 --> 00:36:25,705
Folks, could you give us five minutes?

590
00:36:25,863 --> 00:36:26,642
Thanks.

591
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,669
Not withstanding your conviction that the man had absolutely nothing to do

592
00:36:31,715 --> 00:36:36,897
with his wife's abduction, we've discovered a couple of very interesting omissions in his story.

593
00:36:36,963 --> 00:36:40,849
Remember how two of his neighbors testified they saw Captain Call leave for work at 4:00,

594
00:36:40,911 --> 00:36:43,179
and then his wife leave the house at around 5:15,

595
00:36:43,256 --> 00:36:45,678
thus providing him with what should have been an airtight alibi?

596
00:36:45,729 --> 00:36:50,107
Turns out, his flight that normally leaves at 6:00 p.m. was delayed for four hours.

597
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:53,486
And it turns out, Mrs. Call's parents both died last year in a boating accident,

598
00:36:53,562 --> 00:36:55,990
leaving a rather considerable fortune to their only daughter.

599
00:36:56,051 --> 00:37:00,311
Which, obviously, the husband would inherit, should she pass first.

600
00:37:04,109 --> 00:37:05,108
Allison...

601
00:37:08,283 --> 00:37:09,634
...you look like you're going to cry.

602
00:37:12,031 --> 00:37:13,736
Everybody's wrong once in a while.

603
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:15,476
You did lead us to the victim's body.

604
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:16,505
No, it's not that.

605
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:20,300
In fact, I'm fairly certain that he did kill his wife.

606
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,458
In fact, I think I have the physical evidence to prove it.

607
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:27,631
This is Captain Call's.

608
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,021
This is his security badge from the airport.

609
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:36,341
If you'll look inside the plastic protector, you'll see grains of sand.

610
00:37:36,663 --> 00:37:38,660
I'm pretty sure, if you have it tested,

611
00:37:39,069 --> 00:37:42,295
you'll find it's from the desert where we discovered the body.

612
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:43,996
Wait a second. Where are you going?

613
00:37:44,533 --> 00:37:46,208
I have to get to the airport. I-I...

614
00:37:47,256 --> 00:37:49,002
What's going on? You got people coming in?

615
00:37:50,818 --> 00:37:52,254
I guess you could say that.

616
00:37:54,276 --> 00:37:59,996
When you see Captain Call, wish him a happy anniversary for me.

617
00:38:13,114 --> 00:38:14,489
Going to work?

618
00:38:16,221 --> 00:38:17,613
You're probably gonna need this.

619
00:38:19,935 --> 00:38:21,448
You hear that sand?

620
00:38:22,192 --> 00:38:24,787
Turns out it's from the desert where your wife's body was found.

621
00:38:24,956 --> 00:38:29,022
Hmm. Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn't.

622
00:38:29,255 --> 00:38:33,009
One thing's for certain: You didn't obtain that security pass with a search warrant.

623
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:35,506
That means it's not admissible in court.

624
00:38:36,015 --> 00:38:39,004
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get ready for work.

625
00:38:39,045 --> 00:38:40,188
I have a plane to fly.

626
00:38:41,257 --> 00:38:43,199
You might want to call in sick, cowboy.

627
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:45,498
I have a search warrant.

628
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:49,593
I intend to vacuum every room, every rug, and every drape in this house to find more sand.

629
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,999
I'll even vacuum between your toes, up your nose and in your ass, if I have to.

630
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:04,324
Mrs. Dubois, at this point, its still circling over Cleveland.

631
00:39:04,457 --> 00:39:07,047
We're estimating it'll land about six minutes from now--

632
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:08,599
a little late, due to weather.

633
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:10,581
That's okay. I'll wait.

634
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:14,113
Mrs. Dubois, I'm happy to tell you as soon as the plane has landed,

635
00:39:14,236 --> 00:39:17,693
but standing here and waiting like this-- it's just not necessary.

636
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:19,258
You can call on your phone.

637
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:21,455
You can monitor the flight on your computer at home.

638
00:39:21,522 --> 00:39:22,894
But you'll know first, right?

639
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:25,556
I mean, you'll know the second that they actually land.

640
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,279
That's okay. I'll wait.

641
00:39:42,905 --> 00:39:43,866
This seat taken?

642
00:39:44,537 --> 00:39:45,284
Hey.

643
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,055
I want you to know, you're making our baby-sitter the richest 16-year-old in Phoenix.

644
00:39:53,114 --> 00:39:55,677
I took a cab. I thought you might want some company on the ride home.

645
00:40:00,383 --> 00:40:01,463
No word yet?

646
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,961
Well, they took him into custody.

647
00:40:04,817 --> 00:40:08,591
As soon as they took the death penalty off the table, he confessed to everything.

648
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:10,388
He'd been planning it for months.

649
00:40:10,469 --> 00:40:13,854
Waiting for a day when he knew in advance there'd be a long flight delay.

650
00:40:15,308 --> 00:40:18,283
Went to work on time, deliberately left his security pass,

651
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,627
called his wife, asked her to bring it to the airport.

652
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,610
When she arrived, he met her at curbside.

653
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,748
Told her he had some extra time, invited her out to eat.

654
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:30,520
Pulled into an alley, leaned across as if he was going to kiss her.

655
00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:34,676
He suffocated her with a plastic bag.

656
00:40:35,686 --> 00:40:38,189
Drove her out to the desert, buried her.

657
00:40:39,946 --> 00:40:44,922
Left her car at a shopping mall and still got back in time to fly that plane to Cleveland.

658
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:45,926
Mrs. Dubois?

659
00:40:46,704 --> 00:40:49,562
Just wanted to let you know, the flight landed in Cleveland.

660
00:40:49,623 --> 00:40:51,721
They're taxiing to the arrival gate right now.

661
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,812
Thank you.

662
00:40:55,163 --> 00:40:55,966
Let's go home.

663
00:40:56,604 --> 00:40:57,446
Hallelujah.

664
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,437
March 31 has come and gone.

665
00:40:59,612 --> 00:41:02,422
Nothing crashed, no one died. All is right with the world.

666
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,659
Well, this year, anyway.

667
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,659
Hi, Daddy.

668
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,259
Morning, Bridge.

669
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,859
Where's your helmet?

670
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,059
Hey, what's going on?

671
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,959
Bridget's here, she's helmet free.

672
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,459
No more helmet, really?

673
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,999
I don't know, maybe when I ride my bike...

674
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,109
Anyways... Here're the pictures.

675
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,159
You guys weren't home before I went to bed.

676
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,009
You guys have to decide which one is the one.

677
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,999
Allright sweetie, well give'em to daddy and we'll look at 'em 

678
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,859
Hey Bridg', what's the deal with the galoshes?

679
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,159
You're expecting rain in the family room?

680
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,359
I don't know, I like the way they sound.
