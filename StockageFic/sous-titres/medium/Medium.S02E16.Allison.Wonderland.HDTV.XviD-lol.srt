1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,900
Agent 47, wake up.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,800
Agent 47,

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,100
I just got word
your mission is over.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,600
It's been terminated.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,800
-Take a drink of this.
-I'm sorry, I don't really like the taste.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,100
Okay, I hear that.
But it's policy.

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,200
Guys.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,700
-Please, no!I don't like the taste!
-I understand,but my hands are tied.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,500
It's policy.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,500
Come on now,keep your mouth open.

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,600
There's nothing I can do.
I'm just following procedure.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,200
 You should feel good.
What you've accomplished--

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,700
the definition of a job well done.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,100
So... would you like to see your next mission?

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,000
-No...!No!
-Your next assignment 
involves research into the effects of

16
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,200
gravity on the human skull.

17
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,100
My friends here are going to let go of your legs.

18
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,800
And then, we're all going to
place bets on how big a spot

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,200
you leave on the sidewalk.
Pretty exciting, huh?

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,200
-One...
-No, no, please!

21
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,600
-two...
-This isn't what I signed up for!

22
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,000
three.

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,700
You okay? 

24
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,600
I just had the craziest dream.

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,500
Did you just hear yourself?

26
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,600
No, I mean,David Carradine was in it.

27
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,500
He fell to his death.These guys,

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,600
they pushed him off this building and he died.

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,300
That's what I dreamt about.

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Wow...That sounds damn near...normal.

31
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,300
You think so?

32
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,200
Yeah, absolutely.

33
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,700
To be perfectly honest, 
I just had a crazy dream, too.

34
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,800
No kidding?

35
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,100
No.and there was no one there 
but me and Angelina Jolie.

36
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,500
-What are you...
-That's not funny.

37
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,500
I thought we were having a conversation.

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,100
I don't even find her attractive.

39
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,300
What are you doing?

40
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,800
Shh!

41
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,100
You're not supposed to read at the table.

42
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,100
Mom.

43
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,200
What, Ariel?

44
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,800
Nothing.

45
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,000
It's 20 after 7:00.
Why did you let me sleep?

46
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,700
I don't know.You seemed happy.

47
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,200
Besides, there's no way I was going to get 
between you and Angelina.

48
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,500
Who's Angelina?

49
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
No one.

50
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,800
A friend of your father's.

51
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,900
I take it there are no mentions 
of Grasshopper tumbling to his death 

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,200
in this morning's paper.

53
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,100
No, not a one.

54
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,300
Hmm.

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,200
What's that?

56
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,300
-What's that?
-That.

57
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,200
That quiet.

58
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,100
I find it unsettling at this hour of the morning.

59
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Where's the noise?
Where's the commotion?

60
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,600
Bridgette's reading.

61
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,600
Shh! Shh!

62
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,000
 Danielle in Danger?
Didn't we read that last night, Bridge?

63
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,700
I know, but I really like it.

64
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,800
Danielle in Danger,

65
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,700
 Danielle in Distress,

66
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,500
 Danielle in the Deep End--
 she has them all.

67
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,100
She reads them all the time.

68
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,000
Last time, I found her 
in the bathroom reading it.

69
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,800
They're good.

70
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,700
You're getting food all over it.

71
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,700
Am not.
Am not.

72
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
And the only reason I'm reading it again

73
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,200
is because we don't have any more, 
and I like it.

74
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,800
And I like that you like it.

75
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,700
I like it, too.

76
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,100
In fact, 

77
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,700
I'm going to stop by the bookstore 
on my way home from work tonight.

78
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,500
Whatever else Danielle is in,
I'm going to find it.

79
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,200
Really?

80
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,500
Sure.

81
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,400
Danielle at the Deli,

82
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
Danielle in Duluth,

83
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,100
Danielle in the Dumps.

84
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,500
Wherever Danielle has been,
I'm going to find it.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,600
I must apologize for the other evening.

86
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,000
Is there some reason you won't look at me?

87
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,200
I mean, other than the obvious.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,400
It must have been a horrible way to die.

89
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,900
I was left with no choice.
The agency was left with no choice.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,700
I mean, we have to preserve the code.

91
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,000
Right?

92
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,700
I just hope that someday 
you find a way to forgive us all.

93
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,700
Ma'am, 
are you getting out?

94
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,500
I'm not a big one to solicit favors.

95
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,300
My wife does charity work with
a woman named Jessica Delany.

96
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,300
Her brother's been missing for almost two weeks now,
and...

97
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,500
she asked me if I knew someone who could check it out

98
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,300
without actually making it a police matter.

99
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

100
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,800
Her brother's apparently
something of a wild hair.

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,900
Hasn't been able to hold down a job for years,
pretty eccentric guy.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,400
But

103
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,800
it's not like him to not stay in touch.

104
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,700
And as I mentioned,they've not been able

105
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,700
to make contact with him for almost two weeks.

106
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,000
She and her husband basically support him.

107
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,800
I still don't get it.
Why call you?

108
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,600
Why avoid the police?

109
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,400
And if you've got to avoid the police,
why not just hire a private detective?

110
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,000
They did hire a private detective.
He came up with nothing.

111
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,600
So why not go to the police?

112
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,600
Apparently,along with a host
of other eccentric habits,

113
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,200
this guy's terrified of the police.

114
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,300
They're worried that if law enforcement
starts snooping around,

115
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,800
he'll never come out of hiding.

116
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,300
I was hoping between the two of you...

117
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,200
Sure.

118
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,500
I can do the usual--
call the hospitals, the morgue.

119
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,400
And, if you don't mind,

120
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,200
this is his address
and his landlord's phone number.

121
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,400
The landlord's been told
to expect a phone call

122
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,500
from a family friend who might show up,
want to take a look around.

123
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,500
I'm happy to try.

124
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,100
You want some company?

125
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Sure.

126
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,700
I'll call you after I make
contact with the landlord.

127
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,700
Codes are amazing,
aren't they Miss Dubois?

128
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,700
Life is a kind of a code,
isn't it?

129
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,900
And death.

130
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,500
Death is a kind of code,too.

131
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,100
wouldn't you say?

132
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,300
If there's any way we can do it 
on my way home tonight,

133
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,800
say around 8:00...

134
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Allison.

135
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,000
Allison?

136
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,500
Hi, excuse me.

137
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,200
I'm looking for the Danielle books.

138
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,700
-Danielle in Danger...Those...
-Oh, Beverly Rhodes.

139
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,100
She's a wonderful writer.

140
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,900
Right here we have three.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,600
 Danielle in Danger,Danielle in Distress
and Danielle in the Deep End.

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,800
Ah, yes, no.Those are the ones we have.

143
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,100
I was hoping there might be some others.

144
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,900
Let's check the computer.

145
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,300
I'm sorry, those are the only
three that were published.

146
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,900
Hmm.

147
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,300
Oh.

148
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,100
Um,okay.
Are any more coming?

149
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,600
Is old Beverly banging out another one?

150
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,000
I got a little one who's
just nuts for these things.

151
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,600
I kind of doubt it.

152
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,000
Beverly Rhodes passed away last year.

153
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,200
"And so, Danielle declared,'It pays to be prepared.

154
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,500
"'With homework done,there's time for fun.

155
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,300
No distress anywhere.'"

156
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,300
-Night,Angel.
-Night,Daddy.

157
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,400
okay.

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,400
You read that good, Daddy.

159
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,600
Thank you,I appreciate that.
I know this can be a tough room.

160
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,400
-I love Danielle.
-I know you do,sweetheart.

161
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,500
Uh, but you know what I was thinking?
I was thinking that maybe

162
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,500
we should start reading some 
other books and give Danielle

163
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,100
a rest for a little while, huh?

164
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,000
But I don't want to give Danielle a rest.

165
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,600
I want to read everything
there is to read about her.

166
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Well, as it turns out,I think that you have.

167
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,800
There are only three books,
honey, you have them all.

168
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,000
-Nuh-uh.
-Mm-hmm.Sure you do.You got Distress.

169
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,500
 Danger, Deep End.That's all there is.

170
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,700
Nuh-un.
I know there's another one.

171
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,800
I don't think so, honey.I'll check again,
but I don't think so.

172
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,700
In the meantime,don't let those bedbugs bite.

173
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
I won't, Daddy.

174
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Must be the maid's year off.

175
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,800
What do you think all 
this stuff is about?

176
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,400
I don't know.

177
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,200
Maybe he's calculated how much to tip the guy
who delivered all these pizzas.

178
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,300
( man reading equations,
 voice overlapping itself )

179
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,900
Yes, sir.Yeah, 
I'm at liberty to do that.

180
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,900
Los Angeles, the Harmon Hotel,
day after tomorrow.

181
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,600
No, I can do that.

182
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,000
Check in and waitto hear from you.
I got it.

183
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,900
Think our boy took a little trip.

184
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,500
Drawers are open,
clothes seem to be missing.

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,100
No toothbrush or toothpaste or comb
in the bathroom.

186
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,900
No wallet, no I.D., no keys.

187
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
You all right?

188
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:16,700
Yeah.

189
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,700
I think he might be in Los Angeles.
The Harmon Hotel.

190
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,700
Okay.

191
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Anything else?

192
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,800
Yeah.

193
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,900
I think he might look a lot like
David Carradine.

194
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,500
You awake?

195
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh,yeah.

196
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,900
What are you doing?

197
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,300
Is that Daddy's work computer?

198
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,800
You know you're never supposed to play with
Daddy's work computer.

199
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,700
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,100
How long were you there?

201
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,900
I don't know.
A little while, I guess.

202
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,000
Bridgette.

203
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,600
What did the misfit of science do now?

204
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,800
-Ariel.
-None of your beeswax.

205
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,400
Who cares.
Can I have some microwave oatmeal?

206
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,400
Yeah.

207
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,500
-You left the bathroom a mess again.
-Did not.

208
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,900
Your underwear is on the counter.

209
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,300
Your towel is in the tub,
and youdon't flush.

210
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,500
-Do, too.
-Do not.

211
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,500
-Do, too.
-Fine,then whose poo was it 
in the toilet this morning,huh?

212
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,800
-Not my poo.
-Was, too.

213
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,300
Can we not... discuss poo
at the kitchen table?

214
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,400
Thank you.

215
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,700
Can you come here for a minute?

216
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,300
-What's up?
-I need to cook something for one minute.

217
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,200
( girls arguing indistinctly )

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,700
Okay.

219
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,900
-You were looking for me?
-Yeah, come in.

220
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,400
So I've known you for what,
little over a year now?

221
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,200
And I have to confess,that every time one 
of your things comes true.

222
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,500
What are you talking about?

223
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,100
Jessica Delany's brother?

224
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,600
He was registered at the Harmon
Hotel in Los Angeles.

225
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,900
I was authorized by the family 
early this morning

226
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,800
to send Detective Scanlon out there.

227
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,000
So...

228
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,700
Thank you.

229
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,700
I'm very appreciative,
and I just wantedto tell you so.

230
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,500
Have you given any thought to our problem?

231
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,600
How do we thwart these terrorists?
How do we stop them before they strike?

232
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,600
Who are you?

233
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,100
What are you?

234
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,700
Are you a ghost?
Are you a hallucination?Are you a dream?

235
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,800
You understand how these
terrorists operate, don't you?

236
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
When a terrorist needs to communicate,
he or she requests a password.

237
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,200
They can do this from anywhere,
from a payphone,from a cell phone, an email.

238
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,800
The means is unimportant.

239
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,200
What is important is they are then sent a password

240
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,300
over the phone,over the Internet, over a pager,
not terribly secure.

241
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,100
But what they do with that password is they enter it
into a device like this,

242
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,300
wihich uses a complex algorithmic formula
to create a new password,

243
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,800
the real password,a fluid password, a password
that changes every six seconds.

244
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,300
I'm asking you

245
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,200
please sit down and 

246
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,900
crack the algorithmic formula that makes
this conversion possible.

247
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,100
I don't understand.I think you have
the wrong person.

249
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Are you not the one
who said Harmon Hotel?

250
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,700
Allison,it's a simple "thank you".

251
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,100
Just accept it gracefully,and get the hell out of here
so I can do my work.

252
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Yeah... yes, yes,
of course, sir.

253
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,200
You think they're all
watching you, don't you?

254
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,100
That's the paranoia kicking in.
You have drugsfor that.

255
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,300
Don't worry about them.

256
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,200
Me and my people will take care of them.

257
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,100
All you need to be thinking about
is code decode,

258
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,200
code decode,

259
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,900
code decode.

260
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,300
Code decode!

261
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,700
( phone playing musical ring tone )

262
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,300
Hi.

263
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,000
Hey. 

264
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,300
-You all right?You sound stressed.
-You call me,what's going on?

265
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,100
I'm just trying to figure something out.

266
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,800
I'm transferring files from my
laptop to my office computer,

267
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,100
and there are some files here
that I don't recognize.

268
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,500
-Um, did you maybe...
-Bridgette was playing
with it this morning.

269
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,700
I'm sorry-- I stopped her.

270
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,200
I don't think she had a chance
to do any real harm.

271
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,700
It's okay.
As long as I know what it is.

272
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,900
I didn't know whether to print
it out or throw it away.

273
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,200
Listen, I got to go.
The coast is clear.

274
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,200
The coast is clear?

275
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,400
Al?

276
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,100
I'm really sorry.

277
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,900
I'm...sorry to put you through always.

278
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,600
It's really horrible,their eyes
following you like that.

279
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Convinced they're all
watching you, all after you.

280
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,900
I...suspect your a lot like me


281
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,300
smart enough to know
it's not really happening,

282
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,300
but still,

283
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,700
the heart starts to race,
the adrenaline starts to kick in.

284
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,200
It's impossible
not to be sucked into it.

285
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,400
So these are delusions?

286
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,000
It's all life, right?

287
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,400
I mean, I'm not really sure.

288
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,900
I'm a  mathematician,not a psychiatrist,

289
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,400
but I strongly suspectthat 
everything I'm seeing,everything I'm feeling,

290
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,800
some of it probably isn't there.

291
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,700
So these things that I'm seeing,
these things that I'm feeling...

292
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,800
you're sending them to me?

293
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,900
I think so.

294
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,900
Even that man who keeps talking about codes?

295
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,000
So what are these?
Are these memories or fantasies?

296
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,600
All sorts of things.
Probably a little bit of everything.

297
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,800
I'm really sorry.

298
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,800
You know, you look like a famous actor.

299
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,500
Really?

300
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,900
My goodness.

301
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,600
Anyone I would reganize

302
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,500
Do you know who David Carradine is?

303
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,700
Of course.

304
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I imagine I'm him a lot.

305
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,200
Lots of guys.
Lots of different times...

306
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,500
but..him a lot.

307
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,500
Allison?

308
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,800
What are you doing in here
with the lights off?

309
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,100
Tell me you're all right.

310
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,400
I'm all right.

311
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,200
Yeah.

312
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,900
Well, you just did me a favor,

313
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,500
now I'm going to do you one--

314
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,000
go home.
Take the rest of the day off.

315
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,100
-That's not necessary.
-Okay, it's not a favor.It's an order.

316
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:15,400
See you tomorrow.

317
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
See you tomorrow.

318
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,500
Movie star guy.

319
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,500
Movie star guy?

320
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,700
I need you to wake up.

321
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,600
There's someone on the phone for you.

322
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,400
Mom.

323
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,600
Didn't you hear me?

324
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,800
I said "Mom, there's someone on the phone for you."

325
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,600
Sorry, honey,
I must have dozed off.

326
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,200
Hello?

327
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,300
Greetings from L.A.--

328
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,500
what do you want to hear,
the good, the bad, or the weird?

329
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Well, it can't get any weirder
than it's been herthan it's been her

330
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,400
an it's been herso start wherever you'd like.

331
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,300
Well the good news is he was here, all right.

332
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,100
The bad news is, apparently,he jumped off the roof of 
this place two nights ago.

333
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,100
They've been trying to I.D. him ever since.

334
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
I'm waiting for a car now to 

335
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,000
take me to the airport pick up the family,
escort them to the morgue.

336
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,800
Don't laugh,

337
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,300
but are you sure he jumped?

338
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,100
Which brings us to the weird part.Allison, 

339
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,100
this guy was as nutty as a fruitcake.

340
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,300
His bathroom counter was covered with prescription

341
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,000
antipsychotic medications,none of which were found
in his stomach, by the way.

342
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,900
He was a textbook paranoid schizophrenic 
who went off his meds

343
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,100
and jumped off a diving board
that wasn't there.

344
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,400
I'm just curious.

345
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,800
Any of the people there,
any of the people who saw him,

346
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,300
any of the people at the hotel,

347
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,500
did anyone happen to mention 
that he looked like...

348
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,400
a movie star?

349
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,200
What?

350
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,000
Nothing.

351
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,900
"She was no fool,
while in the pool.

352
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,700
"Danielle played smart,
followed all the rules.

353
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,900
"She made safety her friend,
while in the deep end."

354
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,200
-You read that good, Daddy.
-My biggest fan.

355
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,500
Sleep tight.

356
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'll see you in the morning.

357
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,500
-Good night, Daddy.
-Good night, sweetie.

358
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Close your eyes.
Good girl. Okay.

359
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,400
Daddy?

360
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,800
Yes,sweetie.

361
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,500
When are we going to read the new one?

362
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,900
The new one what, babe?

363
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The new Danielle.

364
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,300
Honey, I explained that to you yesterday.
There is no new Danielle.

365
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,400
There's only three Danielle books,
and we have them all.

366
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,500
-Nuh-uh. There's another one.
-No, sweetie,only three.

367
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,100
The woman who wrote them--
she's not writing them anymore.

368
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,800
She's done with Danielle.

369
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,900
Nuh-uh.

370
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,200
There's another one.
She told it to me.

371
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,900
I wrote it on your computer.

372
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,100
 So, where's your laptop?

373
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,900
At the office. Of course.
'Cause I need it at home.

374
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Well, don't stress about it.
You'll go to work,

375
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,400
you'll print out t fand you'll see.

376
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,500
How can you be so calm?

377
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,200
I mean, what choice do I have?

378
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,900
What would be so terrible
if you opened your computer

379
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,300
and discovered that you do
have a new Danielle book?

380
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,600
What would be so terrible?

381
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,400
Don't you find it at all disturbing

382
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,900
that your daughter may have
taken dictation from a dead woman?

383
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,100
What's the matter with me?
Look at who I'm asking.

384
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,000
What does that mean?

385
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
I don't know. I just...

386
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,800
This is just one of those times when I think

387
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,200
I would have preferred
if they'd inherited your allergy to ragweed.

388
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,000
I don't mean that. I'm just...

389
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,800
She just turned seven.

390
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,800
I'd like to believe that 
I have a little bit of control over 

391
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,200
who her friends are,

392
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,500
who she spends her time with.

393
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,300
Maybe you're jumping the gun.You know,

394
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,800
you may very well get to work, 

395
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,300
turn on that computer,and find you have nothing
but gobbledygook.

396
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,200
That would be a tremendous relief.

397
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,300
Is there any word from Scanlon?

398
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,600
Her sister and her husband 
identified the body a couple of hours ago.

399
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,900
Apparently,
he was a PhD candidate at Stanford.

400
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,200
He started hearing voices and seeing things in 1997.

401
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,900
He was doing pretty good on meds till 9/11.

402
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,400
Then he became convinced that 
he held the key to some sort of

403
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,100
coding device.

404
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,500
So he went off his meds so he could concentrate

405
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,100
on his mathematical equations.

406
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,800
He'd disappear for days,
pop up in other cities.

407
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,900
She pleaded with him to go back
on his prescriptions,

408
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,900
but he said that...

409
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,100
they interfered with his thought process.

410
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,100
His government work.

411
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,400
That's sad.

412
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,100
I'm gonna meet with the sister
and her husband tomorrow.

413
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,200
I can't even imagine
what they're going through.

414
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,600
Hello.

415
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,600
"Danielle chose not to play,
Danielle felt bad that day.

416
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,700
"Her smile was gone,her spirit wan.
Her best friend had moved away."

417
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,000
Well, darling, 
there's no gobble in that gook.

418
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,200
Allison?

419
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,400
I-I... I don't know what to say.

420
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,700
I'm late for a meeting.
I don't know what to say.

421
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,200
Well, what is there to say?

422
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,300
Oprah has a book club.
Why shouldn't Bridgette?

423
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,100
Joe...

424
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,200
Hey, think about it.There are a lot of great,
dead authors.

425
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,200
She could channel a new Hemingway novel, 

426
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,500
a new Dickens.
Imagine. A Tale of Three Cities.

427
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,100
C-Can we discuss this tonight?

428
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,800
Can we discuss this
when I get home?

429
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,800
I suppose. Danielle will keep.

430
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,800
And the author
certainly isn't going anywhere.

431
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,800
-Sure. Tonight.
-Thank you.

432
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,200
-Have a good meeting.
-I'll try.

433
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,700
Nice of you to finally show up.

434
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,100
Sorry.

435
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,300
It's okay. Nice people.

436
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
Jessica Delany's very anxious to meet the woman

437
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,400
whose good old-fashioned
detective work helped her find her brother.

438
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,700
Jessica, this is Allison Dubois.

439
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,100
She's the investigator who figured out

440
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,000
that your brother was in Los Angeles.

441
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,100
I'm so sorry about how things turned out.

442
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,900
I'm so sorry about your brother.

443
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,000
I appreciate that. Thank you.

444
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,100
Um, this is my husband David.

445
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,200
Um, can you hold on a minute?

446
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,600
I'm sorry. Forgive me. 
It's the mortuary.You are, um...

447
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,300
Agent 47, wake up.

448
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Allison. Allison Dubois.

449
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,400
You saw him throw his brother-in-law
off the roof of that hotel?

450
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,000
Yes .Well,no.

451
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,700
Actually, I saw him throw 
David Carradine off the roof of that Hotel.

452
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,600
Actually, it was two guys he hired.

453
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,500
But I don't think
that's an important distinction.

454
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,100
Okay. Now I am confused.

455
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,100
How exactly does David Carradine 
figure into any of this?

456
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,500
Well, I'm not sure,but my best guess,

457
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,700
is the night that David Delany's
brother-in-law died,

458
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,200
his spirit started sending me messages.

459
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,400
And unfortunately,
they were the messages of a mentally ill man

460
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,900
who's been off his medication for some time.

461
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,900
So, the things that he showed me
were the way that he perceived them.

462
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,500
The world that he lives in--

463
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,200
he's the star of his own movie.

464
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,600
He's the superhero.

465
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,500
He's a man fighting an unbeatable foe.

466
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,200
And of course, he made himself 
look like a movie star.

467
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,800
I can't dismiss the fact

468
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,800
that he cast his brother-in-law
as the villain.

469
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,600
That in his mind,in his delusion,

470
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,600
this is the man who betrayed him.
This is the man responsiblefor his death.

471
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,100
Delusion is the key wordere.

472
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,600
He didn't look
like a movie star,

473
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,200
or a superhero in life,
and he wasn't one.

474
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,100
And insofar as we can determine,
he wasn't doing any work

475
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,700
for the government,
wasn't actually cracking terrorist codes.

476
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,700
Now, I'll happily ask,
but I'm reasonably certain

477
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,500
that the gentleman
in that conference room

478
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
has a perfectly logical explanation

479
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,600
for where he was the night
of his brother-in-law's fall.

480
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,700
After all, he is the one who's been supporting him
for the last five years.

481
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,200
And according to Jessica,they were very close.

482
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,900
Actually spent a fair 
amount of time together.

483
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,200
Is this really something
you want us to pursue?

484
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,400
I don't know.

485
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,700
You're right. It's crazy.
He jumped, but it's just...

486
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,900
The movie's always
more interesting than the truth.

487
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,600
You saw all that nonsense
he was working on.

488
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,300
These are nice people.

489
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,800
They're already in a fair amount of pain.

490
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'd rather not go in there
and open this particular can

491
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,100
of worms unless you're absolutely certain.

492
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,400
No. No, you're right.

493
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
We shouldn't.

494
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,600
What are those?

495
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,100
Personal effects.

496
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,200
We were holding onto them
as possible evidence.

497
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,300
Jessica wants the family photos,a scrapbook,

498
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,400
and her husband wants
to hold on to the math.

499
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,400
The math?

500
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,000
The stuff on the walls.

501
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,900
He's a finance guy.
Apparently, he's fascinated by the stuff.

502
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,300
Uh, could you hold on to those
for a  coup ofor a coup so I could take a look at them--

503
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,000
the math, I mean?

504
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
I was half hoping I'd read this stuff
and convince myself

505
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,200
it was all a product
of Bridgette's imagination,

506
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,400
but I just don't see her
coming up with words like "wan."

507
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,500
I couldn't even finish it, I was so...

508
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,000
She wants me to come in
there and read it to her.

509
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,300
Okay.

510
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,700
Okay?What...?
You really think this is okay,Al?

511
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,500
I don't know.

512
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,700
I don't think I should be doing
anything to encourage all this.

513
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,700
All what?

514
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,200
If you really believe this came from the woman
who wrote the Danielle books,

515
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,400
how lovely, how flattering

516
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,700
she heard our child's pleafor more,
and she chose to answer it.

517
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Uh...

518
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,000
If you can't get your head
around that, that's fine, too.

519
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,000
All it means is that Bridgette is precocious.

520
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,600
She took the three booksthat she loved,
and she wrote one for herself.

521
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,800
Either way...

522
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,300
Wait a second.

523
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,700
You really think that Bridgette might 
have come up with this herself?

524
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,900
Kids have done crazier things.

525
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,500
Hell, maybe that's what inspiration is.

526
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,100
Some original thought,and some desire,

527
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,600
and a willingness to listento the voices of 
the peoplewho came before us,

528
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,100
Whispering to us,and encouraging us.

529
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,800
Why are you looking at me like that?

530
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,100
You think I'm crazy, right?

531
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,000
No.

532
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,100
I think you're brilliant.
I think you're beautiful.

533
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,700
I know you're crazy.

534
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And I've learned
there's no point in arguing with a crazy person.

535
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,700
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to read to Bridgette.

536
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,200
I'll read to Bridgette.

537
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,100
I need you to look at something.

538
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,700
Some stuff I broug

539
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,200
What is this?

540
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,600
It's math, I think.

541
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,500
You think?

542
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,100
I think,like you think I'm beautiful.

543
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,100
"Danielle was happy once more.

544
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,000
"Someone new had moved in next door.

545
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,200
"Ariel was her name.

546
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,200
"She had great toys and games.

547
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,900
Danielle would be lonely no more."

548
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,000
Yay.

549
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,300
You read that really good,Mommy.
Almost as good as Daddy.

550
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,600
Thank you, honey.

551
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,900
So, Ariel, huh?
She's the one that makes Danielle feel better?

552
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,500
Yeah. Well,
it's a pretty common name, Mom.

553
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,800
Mm.

554
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,100
I'm sorry that I yelled at you
for using Daddy's computer.

555
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,700
But it's Daddy's, and we
shouldn't play with it.

556
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,900
But maybe tomorrow, 

557
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,100
I mean, 

558
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,000
in case there's another story 
a writer wants you to put down.

559
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,200
That would be really great,Mommy,

560
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,700
'cause I'm hearing stories 
in my head all the time.

561
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,700
I bet you are.

562
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,700
Give me a kiss.

563
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,600
Thank you for the sugar.

564
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,500
Oh, no, Joe.
It's worse than we thought.

565
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,400
Not only might she be a Touch Psychic,

566
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,800
I fear deeply that she may be...
creative.

567
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,200
You didn't find another one, did you?

568
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,500
Come here, I want to show you something.

569
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
What am I looking at?

570
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,600
Wait a second,I've seen one of those before.
What is that?

571
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,100
It's called a pass code generator.

572
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,000
It's used with secure computer networks--

573
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,300
the kind that big corporations
with lots of

574
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,700
sensitive data have,
like banks and investment houses.

575
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,600
Okay...

576
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,000
Right, so let's say that
you want to let your employees

577
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,000
use the Internet to access your network

578
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,400
from home or when they're on the road.

579
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,800
Obviously, you're going to want to secure 
things with a password,

580
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,300
a password that's going to change 
relatively frequently.

581
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,500
Now, what happens is,
that every few minutes or so,the company server

582
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,400
sends out a page to everybody's pager or cell phone.

583
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,600
Wow, this sounds terribly familiar.

584
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,000
Now, to guard against anybody intercepting 
the page or the text message,

585
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,900
they issue everyone...

586
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,800
-one of these.
-One of these.

587
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,800
Sorry.

588
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,500
Right. There's a program that's hard-wired

589
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,700
into this thing that runs a series of 
fancy mathematical transformations,

590
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,400
ultimately kicking out the new password.

591
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,100
The new password...
the real password?

592
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,300
For banks,financial institutions?

593
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
Well, that's what this particular 
model is for, yeah.

594
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,700
Of course, if you don't
have one of these,

595
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,300
and you happen to be a friggin' genius,

596
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,200
then you can also do all of this.

597
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,600
-You just lost me.
-Well, all of this...

598
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,400
equals that.

599
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,000
Okay, one more time for those of us

600
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,000
who had to repeat math in summer school.

601
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
He was calculating pass codes.

602
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:47,800
What do you mean?

603
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,500
He was doing the same thing
that that little gadget does,only by hand.

604
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,700
So someone, somewhere,
could get into a computer

605
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,700
that they otherwise couldn't get into.

606
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,100
Presumably.

607
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,800
Were you just saying
something to me about Bridgette?

608
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Oh... yeah.

609
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,500
Yeah, wherever that story came from,

610
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,700
I really don't think it came to her whole.

611
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,800
There is a lot of Bridgette in it.

612
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,100
I think she's just smart.
Like her dad.

613
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:21,800
Mm.

614
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,400
Hey,wait a second,
where you going?

615
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,100
That was just getting good.

616
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,600
Jessica.

617
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,600
When your brother first fell to 
his death in Los Angeles,

618
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,500
after the local authorities 
were able to identify him,

619
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,100
they all assumed--
we all assumed--

620
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,800
given his history of mental problems,

621
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,900
that his death was self-inflicted.
That he simply jumped.

622
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,200
But since then,some new evidence has come to light

623
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,800
that would seem to suggest that...

624
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,200
he was pushed off that roof.

625
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,100
Very much against his will.

626
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,100
I'm sorry, what are we looking at here?

627
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,400
Financial statements from an investment 
account under your wife's name

628
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,400
at the firm of Wile and Price.

629
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,300
I'm sorry,I'm confused.

630
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,900
Did you not just tell me you suspect that
my brother was murdered?

631
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,400
What could that possibly have to do

632
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,000
with my financial statements?

633
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,500
I assure you, we believe there is a connection.

634
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,600
Well, I certainly hope that's true,

635
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,200
these records are private.

636
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,600
When I discover how they came to be 
in your possession...

637
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,700
David.

638
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,500
Those documents were provided
to us by Wilke and Price.

639
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,100
They were more than willing to cooperate

640
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,900
once we alerted them to the possible 
irregularities in the account.

641
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,900
What irregularities?

642
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,000
As you can see,the account was opened

643
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,000
with an initial deposit of $50,000.

644
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,300
Today, barely eight months later...

645
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,300
it's worth over four million.

646
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,300
That's quite a rate of return,wouldn't you say?

647
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,700
I-I don't know what to tell you.

648
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,800
My husband is very gifted
when it comes to making money.

649
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,700
he just is.

650
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,500
But I still don't understand 
what any of this had to do with my brother.

651
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,400
We checked with your investm from 
and discover damndest thing.

652
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,100
At 4:01 Eastern time,right after the markets
closed on Wall Street,

653
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,000
whoever was handling your 
account would electronically

654
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,000
access your holdings
and change them to reflect

655
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,300
the day's winners.
Add some gainers,drop some losers.

656
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,300
Pretty good investment strategy...

657
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,200
if you can get away with it.

658
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,800
Well,I;m baffled.

659
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,300
Darling, have you been reading your 
statements when they come in the mail?

660
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,500
I don't know whether the bank has 
made some kind of mistake in our favor or, 

661
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,800
as you say, for some reason somebody did...

662
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,300
do some thing but...either way,
the money isn't oursand, naturally,

663
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,100
we'll return it.

664
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,200
That's very gib of you.

665
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,700
No, absolutely, 
that's the right thing to do.

666
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,200
It's the only thing to do.

667
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,200
You were once an employee of 
Wilke and Price, weren't you?

668
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
Yes, as a Senior Vice President, why?

669
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,200
None of you are suggesting that 
I had anything to do with this?

670
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,400
That's absurd.

671
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,200
Even if I wanted to manipulate 
my wife's account,

672
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,800
how was I going to go about it?

673
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
I had no access to it.

674
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,600
I was no longer with the company.

675
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,300
Wouldn't be that tough.

676
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,400
Not if you had one of there.

677
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,400
Yes,but I don't.

678
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,600
When I left the firm, 
I surrendered my pass-code device.

679
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,100
So you see,
your theory makes no sense.

680
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,000
Unless, of course, you happened
to have a brother-in-law

681
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,100
with the mathematical skills necessary

682
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,100
to defeat the security safeguards
that the pass code generator

683
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,400
was designed to protect.

684
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,900
A brother-in-law
who could be easily manipulated.

685
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,900
Who could be led to believe 
that he wasn't involved in anything illegal.

686
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,100
That, in fact,

687
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,900
he was essential to the security 
of this country.

688
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,000
But what do you do with a guy like that? 
A relative?

689
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,200
A guy who might talk?

690
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,000
Maybe you could tell him

691
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,400
that the government has 
a new assignment for him

692
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,900
in Los Angeles.

693
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,900
Book him a room at the hotel,

694
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,400
make sure that he spends enough time there

695
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,900
so that everybody sees him talking to himself,

696
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,200
behaving strangely.

697
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,000
So that when he ends up 
a puddle on the sidewalk,

698
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,200
they don't even qusetion why.

699
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,800
Darling, this isn't true.

700
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,300
All of it's true.

701
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,500
I have nothing further to say
until I speak with my lawyer.

702
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,300
That won't be a problem.

703
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,800
Actually, I have him waiting outside.

704
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,900
I'll bring him in.

705
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,900
Pardon me,sir?

706
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,000
-Are you're David Delany's attorney?
-Yes I am.

707
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,000
Well,they'd like you to step inside now.

708
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,900
Oh,really?
And you are?

709
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,600
Allison.
Allison Dubois.

710
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,000
Have we met before?

711
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,600
No.
I don't believe we have.

712
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,700
I have to go pick up my kids,

713
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,500
but you could go through the door right there.

714
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,700
Oh,sir?

715
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,200
Just a one more thing.
Uh,they'll probably arrest you.

716
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
Just a heads up.

717
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,700
Very well done.

718
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,500
Thank you.

719
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,300
How are you doing?

720
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,100
Good ,I think.
Better all the time.

721
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,800
Still worried about my sister.

722
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,700
But good.

723
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,100
Feeling a little silly
for looking like this.

724
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,000
Maybe... the next time...
 we meet...

725
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,500
I'll...

726
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,300
look more like myself.

727
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,500
I'll lood forward to that.
