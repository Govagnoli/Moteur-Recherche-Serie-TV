1
00:00:01,237 --> 00:00:02,064
Grief.

2
00:00:02,742 --> 00:00:03,724
Envy.

3
00:00:04,706 --> 00:00:05,847
Love.

4
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:08,060
Most basic human emotions

5
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:11,438
are communicated in ways
others can easily understand.

6
00:00:11,822 --> 00:00:15,225
Through words, behavior, facial expressions.

7
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:18,334
And then... there's fear.

8
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:24,668
I believe that, when people are
alone and vulnerable and afraid,

9
00:00:25,123 --> 00:00:28,339
they put out a sort of distress signal.

10
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:34,025
An alarm of sorts.

11
00:00:48,872 --> 00:00:50,430
An S.O.S.

12
00:00:58,594 --> 00:01:00,650
It's not visible or audible.

13
00:01:01,218 --> 00:01:03,014
At least not to everyone.

14
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:05,493
Just certain people.

15
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,331
What are you doing, huh?

16
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:25,186
Hey, it's Saturday.

17
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:29,082
We got another half hour or so.
Lay back down. Hmm?

18
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:31,538
I don't think I can. I...

19
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,139
I saw a girl slip and fall.
I got to call somebody.

20
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:36,797
- What?
 - Got to find the phone book.

21
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:38,904
What are you talking about?
Slipped and fell?

22
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,883
Now you're doing slips and falls?

23
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:45,895
What happened to kidnappings
and assaults and murders?

24
00:02:46,093 --> 00:02:47,540
It's a Saturday.

25
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:35,580
Yes. Mariposa State Park.

26
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:39,869
She looked like she was around 18.
She had long blond hair.

27
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,883
She was wearing a white T-shirt
with the name of some sorority on it.

28
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,985
No. I didn't actually witness her fall.

29
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:50,873
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

30
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:52,301
Well, you have to show someone.

31
00:03:52,302 --> 00:03:54,115
- Like who?
- Mom or Dad.

32
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:55,990
But what if I don't want to?

33
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:56,775
Well, you'd better.

34
00:03:56,776 --> 00:03:57,775
Hey, hey, hey.

35
00:03:57,776 --> 00:03:59,001
What's going on?

36
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:01,527
Your baby sister's still asleep.

37
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,845
What's this?

38
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,295
It's a class project.

39
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:12,615
What kind of class project?

40
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:16,432
Well, we're doing this art project
about what our parents do for a living.

41
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:18,507
And I'm doing mine about Mom.

42
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:22,399
That's nice, Bridge.

43
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:24,827
Tell him what it means.

44
00:04:24,828 --> 00:04:26,928
What do you mean,
"what it means"? It's her job.

45
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:28,974
Okay, I get that. I'm just curious.

46
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:31,078
What do you think Mom's job is?

47
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:33,606
Well, she's a guesser and a dreamer.

48
00:04:34,806 --> 00:04:35,829
One more time?

49
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,812
Well, she makes guesses about things,

50
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:40,128
and sometimes she dreams about things.

51
00:04:41,152 --> 00:04:44,313
And she tells all this stuff
to District Attorney Devalos,

52
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:46,358
and he puts people in jail.

53
00:04:49,347 --> 00:04:50,816
I'll be right back.

54
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:54,960
No, Lee, I know the park
is not your jurisdiction,

55
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:58,391
but I called Park Services, and I
couldn't seem to get anyone's attention.

56
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,132
Well, can you just give him a call?

57
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:05,906
Okay. Can you call me back? Thanks.

58
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:10,784
Hey, have you seen this
class project of Bridgette's?

59
00:05:10,785 --> 00:05:14,011
That collage thing with the photographs
and pictures from magazines?

60
00:05:14,154 --> 00:05:15,047
No. Not yet.

61
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,178
You might want to take a look at this thing.

62
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,183
She's got some pretty eerie ideas
about what you do for a living.

63
00:05:21,518 --> 00:05:24,763
Eerie crazy or eerie accurate?

64
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,931
That's a pretty tough call.

65
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:30,836
In the kitchen?

66
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:35,213
We still doing that Family Day thing?

67
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:36,260
Yeah. Remember?

68
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:37,760
We decided to go to the mall.

69
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:39,507
The mall? It's so sunny out.

70
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:42,498
Yeah, well, it's Arizona, Allison.
It's always sunny.

71
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:45,540
Well, I know. It... The mall's so stuffy.

72
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:47,230
They've been there a million times.

73
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:49,578
I kind of want to do something outdoors.

74
00:05:49,586 --> 00:05:50,826
Experience nature.

75
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,553
Nature? What do you mean?

76
00:05:53,192 --> 00:05:54,214
I don't know.

77
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:57,031
I thought maybe we could go to the park.

78
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:59,777
Go for a hike. Climb some rocks.

79
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:08,793
Wow, honey. Is this what you
think Mommy does for work?

80
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:10,217
Uh-huh.

81
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,795
This would be a good thing
to talk about at the park

82
00:06:14,796 --> 00:06:17,094
while we go for a hike and climb some rocks.

83
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:20,867
It's great up here, huh?

84
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:22,530
It's beautiful!

85
00:06:23,262 --> 00:06:26,336
It's boring. I don't understand.
What happened to the mall?

86
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:27,721
Didn't we vote?

87
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:29,387
Isn't this a democracy?

88
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,355
What'so great about the mall?
What do they have at the mall?

89
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:34,241
You're joking, right?

90
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:36,468
How  about clothes?!

91
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:38,000
Well, I hate clothes!

92
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:39,546
Well, there is something wrong with you.

93
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:43,730
Mom, there's an emergency.
We have to call the hospital.

94
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:46,118
This little girl is not my sister.

95
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:47,784
Mom?

96
00:06:49,136 --> 00:06:49,998
Al?

97
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,420
Al?

98
00:06:55,438 --> 00:06:58,514
You know, it was your idea to
come up here in the first place.

99
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:03,066
The very least you can do is participate
in the stimulating conversation.

100
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,516
What are you looking for?

101
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:08,938
You guys figure out
a place to have a picnic.

102
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:10,389
I'll... I want to look at something.

103
00:07:11,619 --> 00:07:13,411
Okay, I'm confused.

104
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:16,991
What is it about that sign
that you do not understand?

105
00:07:16,992 --> 00:07:18,137
I'll be right back.

106
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:21,469
Terrific.

107
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:04,371
I don't get it. Isn't Mommy
a guesser and a dreamer?

108
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:07,172
There is no job called
a guesser or a dreamer.

109
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:09,919
Bridgette, Mom works for
the District Attorney's office

110
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,397
with a lot of other people.

111
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:14,893
She helps them investigate
things-- figure things out.

112
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:17,571
So she's a "figurer"?

113
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:22,954
Daddy's right. I guess
I'm kind of an investigator.

114
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:25,307
You don't dream?

115
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:28,398
Well, sure, I do, but that's not uncommon.

116
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,890
Lots of people dream about
their work once in a while.

117
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,705
I dream. I think. I feel. I explore.

118
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:39,592
And then I follow my instincts.

119
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:42,010
Which, I guess, is what
a lot of investigators do.

120
00:08:42,618 --> 00:08:46,684
Oh.  So, Sherlock, did you find
whatever it was you were looking for?

121
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,027
No. In fact, I did not,
which is probably a good thing.

122
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,627
Anybody want to play Frisbee?

123
00:08:52,628 --> 00:08:57,811
Sure. Marie and I will play, as long as you promise
to try and throw it in our general direction.

124
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,809
I can't help it if the Frisbee
doesn't pay attention.

125
00:09:03,703 --> 00:09:08,215
Oh, girls, be careful over there
by the rocks. Look out for snakes.

126
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:10,573
Hmm. An investigator, huh?

127
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:16,866
And what case are we working
on today, Magnum Dubois?

128
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:18,632
You figured that out, huh?

129
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:20,644
You're not the only one
with instincts around here.

130
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:22,830
That dream that I had...

131
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,074
Slipping? Falling?

132
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:27,444
I do recall that.

133
00:09:28,686 --> 00:09:30,368
This is where it happened.

134
00:09:30,552 --> 00:09:32,554
At least this is where
I thought it happened.

135
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:34,912
Damn accident victims.

136
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:37,014
You just can't count on them.

137
00:09:37,015 --> 00:09:39,377
That's why I tell all my investigator wives

138
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,094
to stick with crime victims.

139
00:09:41,218 --> 00:09:44,016
Kidnap. Murder. Rape.

140
00:09:44,288 --> 00:09:47,504
Horrific, but dependable.

141
00:09:47,823 --> 00:09:49,606
Mom! Dad! I found something!

142
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,542
Bridgette?

143
00:09:51,543 --> 00:09:53,000
What you got there, kiddo?

144
00:09:53,002 --> 00:09:54,460
Maybe there's money in it.

145
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,060
Where did you find this?

146
00:09:58,068 --> 00:09:59,284
Over there.

147
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:02,714
Ariel! Quick! Come on.

148
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:04,221
Sit down. Sit down.

149
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:07,039
Stay here while your daddy goes and looks.

150
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:08,401
What's going on, Al?

151
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:13,586
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?

152
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:16,013
The rest of her.

153
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,544
I hate family day.

154
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:26,794
Can we go photocopymy face again?

155
00:10:27,137 --> 00:10:29,328
You know what, honey, I don't want
to walk away right now.

156
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:31,200
I mean, if your fatherwants to take you...

157
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:34,433
You know, we'vealready got about
six photocopies of your face, Bridge.

158
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:38,746
Tongue in, tongue out, finger in nose,
finger in ear. Why don't we just...

159
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:41,991
I'll be right back.

160
00:10:46,072 --> 00:10:48,591
Her  name is Amy Asher.
18 years old.

161
00:10:48,592 --> 00:10:51,128
She was an out-of-state freshman
from Wheaton, Illinois.

162
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:53,586
That's her, that's the girl I dreamt about,
I called you about.

163
00:10:54,673 --> 00:10:56,598
Wait a second,you dreamt about this girl?

164
00:10:56,831 --> 00:10:59,931
You actually saw her being
sexually assaulted and

165
00:10:59,932 --> 00:11:04,216
strangled to death and then you had a conversation
with Detective Scanlon about it before it ever happened?

166
00:11:04,217 --> 00:11:08,178
No, I dreamt about a girl climbing really
high to try to spray paint a boulder

167
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:09,324
and then slipping.

168
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:11,737
When she called we had no idea this thing
was going to end up like this.

169
00:11:11,783 --> 00:11:16,381
I called Park Services, they went looking for
a girl disabled by a fall, never found her.

170
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,188
Hold on.

171
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:20,401
You guys know more about this than I do.

172
00:11:20,402 --> 00:11:23,056
She was sexually assaulted and strangled?

173
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:26,908
According to the girls we
spoke to over at the sorority,

174
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:29,633
she was sent to paint
Skull Rockas an initiation task.

175
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:32,216
She left her housearound 4:30 this morning

176
00:11:32,217 --> 00:11:34,661
so she could do it without
being spotted by the park rangers.

177
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,431
Okay. I had my dream right after sunrise.

178
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,004
Based on some very preliminary work,

179
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:41,228
the folks over at forensics
are saying it looks like she fell,

180
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:44,939
she broke her left ankle and then was
dragged to where your husband found her.

181
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:49,439
They believe that's where she was sodomized,
raped and then eventually, strangled to death.

182
00:11:49,654 --> 00:11:51,470
The attack was apparently quite savage.

183
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:54,257
How much did your kids actually see?

184
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:55,926
Nothing, thank goodness.

185
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,151
Joe got there first.

186
00:11:57,152 --> 00:11:59,407
Well, Bridgette found her backpack.

187
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:03,195
It was about 15 yards
fromwhere Joe found her body.

188
00:12:03,877 --> 00:12:06,507
We might need to interview
the both of them at some point.

189
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:07,725
Of course.

190
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:09,364
What are the chances?

191
00:12:09,382 --> 00:12:14,839
A girl falls, breaks her ankle and the one person
who happens to cross her path
is a sexual predator and killer.

192
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:19,799
Let's get out of here.

193
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:22,202
Maybe we can salvage
a little of our Saturday.

194
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,418
Anything you can tell me?

195
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,009
Not here, not now.

196
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:36,613
You okay?

197
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,360
Yeah. It was pretty grisly.

198
00:12:39,912 --> 00:12:41,644
It was pretty awful.

199
00:12:41,786 --> 00:12:43,680
Her face...

200
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:46,505
I'm so sorry.

201
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,791
I guess you were right,
we should've gone to the mall after all.

202
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:50,015
It's not your fault.

203
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:53,312
I don't know,I don't understand.

204
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:55,009
What? You don't understand what?

205
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:57,959
Oh, I'm just thinking
about my instincts--

206
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:01,783
I had an instinct about
this girl slipping and falling--

207
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:05,153
and how besides the point
it all seems right now.

208
00:13:06,656 --> 00:13:12,084
It's kind of like sensing that you're sailing into
a little rain when you're on board the Titanic.

209
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,325
Okay, I get it now. Mom's an investigator.

210
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:18,433
- But you know what's weird?
-Your face?

211
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:21,577
Nuh-uh. Us going to the park.
We never go to that park.

212
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:23,656
Just 'cause we never go there
doesn't make it weird.

213
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,420
Well, don't you think it's
weird that we went hiking?

214
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:34,914
Lots of people go hiking. My friend
Rachel Donnelly goes hiking all the time.

215
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,552
Yeah, but we don't.

216
00:13:37,682 --> 00:13:39,608
What's  your point, doofus?

217
00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:42,428
And don't think I didn't notice
you didn't brush your teeth.

218
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:47,188
I mean the one time that
we go hiking, we find a dead body.

219
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:49,705
Don't you think that is weird?

220
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:51,242
I think you're weird.

221
00:13:51,243 --> 00:13:53,171
I think this conversation is weird.

222
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:58,864
Well, think about it. Doesn't it seem like
everywhere Mommy goes she finds dead bodies?

223
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:01,187
She told you,she's an investigator.

224
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:03,617
Investigators are always finding dead bodies.

225
00:14:03,618 --> 00:14:05,629
Today was just a coincidence.

226
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:09,673
I hope so, because I don't want to grow up
and have kids and have to explain why

227
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:14,015
their grandma always had
dead bodies hanging around.

228
00:14:33,211 --> 00:14:34,742
Do you forgive me?

229
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:36,090
Huh?

230
00:14:39,626 --> 00:14:41,430
Do you forgive me?

231
00:14:43,478 --> 00:14:44,855
I forgive you.

232
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:48,413
What did you do?

233
00:14:48,414 --> 00:14:50,511
I dragged you all to the park today.

234
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,672
Yeah, well, it still beats
going to the mall.

235
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:56,887
Putting you and the kids
so close to all that ugliness.

236
00:14:57,894 --> 00:14:59,972
I still can't believe I did that.

237
00:15:00,662 --> 00:15:03,227
I can't believe you saw what you saw.

238
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:06,036
Hey, I can't believe I saw what I saw.

239
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:10,700
And frankly, if I never
see another naked girl

240
00:15:10,815 --> 00:15:16,798
with  that look of horror permanently
etched on her face, that's just fine with me.

241
00:15:17,631 --> 00:15:23,616
As for the kids, Bridgette told me that she wants
a coffee machine of her own for her birthday.

242
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:28,217
Darling, I swear, there's nothing
for you to apologize for.

243
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:31,637
Just... it'd be nice to get a little sleep.

244
00:17:29,762 --> 00:17:31,740
-Yeah?
- Lee, it's Allison.

245
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:33,876
I'm sorry to wake you.
I need your help with something.

246
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,439
What's going on? What's wrong?

247
00:17:36,874 --> 00:17:39,704
I had a dream. This girl was
driving through the desert.

248
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:41,877
Her car ran out of gas and
her cell phone doesn't work.

249
00:17:42,712 --> 00:17:43,666
Okay.

250
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:45,497
Well, what do we do?

251
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:49,111
What do you mean,what do we do?
It sounds like a AAA problem to me.

252
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:51,562
I told you, her cell phone doesn't work.

253
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:53,605
Allison, look, I think you're amazing,

254
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,258
but it's 4:00 in the morning
and I'm a homicide detective.

255
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:59,422
Oh, I know. Normally I wouldn't bother you
with something like this, it's just...

256
00:17:59,656 --> 00:18:01,404
after what happened today...

257
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:04,487
I don't know, there must
be some reason I saw it.

258
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,271
It has to have some importance.

259
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:07,519
Well, that's fine, but...

260
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,149
I guess I could call the highway patrol.

261
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:14,896
Okay.

262
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,894
Tell me anything specific
you might have seen.

263
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,739
Describe the girl, describe the car,
describe the road.

264
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:33,161
Kill me now. It's Sunday.

265
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:36,380
Come on, who the hell is
calling this hour on a Sunday?

266
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,354
Hello?

267
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:41,655
That girl you called me about a couple hours ago,
you said she was drivinga silver sedan?

268
00:18:41,724 --> 00:18:42,526
Uh-huh.

269
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,190
I think we found the car.

270
00:18:44,912 --> 00:18:46,382
Trucker called it in last night.

271
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:50,385
Looks like it just ran out of gas on the side of the
desert highway about 40 miles outside the city.

272
00:18:50,724 --> 00:18:51,980
What about the girl?

273
00:18:52,857 --> 00:18:55,891
Yeah. Well, we found her, too.

274
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:02,861
We're still waiting to hear from forensics.

275
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:05,220
They think that he offered her a ride,

276
00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:08,237
raped her and then strangled her.

277
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:12,871
Is it just me or does this kind of
thing seem to be going around?

278
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:14,465
I know, I thought the same thing.

279
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:18,342
What?

280
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:21,812
Maybe it's broken.

281
00:19:22,482 --> 00:19:24,490
I'm sorry, you lost me.

282
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,814
I don't know.

283
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:28,743
When these girls popped into my dreams,

284
00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:33,500
it was like I was receiving
distress signals or something.

285
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:35,623
I saw them alone, they were in need of help.

286
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:37,770
They were not in danger of being killed.

287
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:40,121
Wait, you still saw them. You just...

288
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:42,578
you didn't get the whole story.

289
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:44,328
That's the thing... I felt like I did.

290
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:47,284
I felt like from the moment
they came into my dreams,

291
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:50,513
these girls, their lives were not in danger.

292
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:54,781
They were just stuck, they were stuck
on the side of the road needing gas,

293
00:19:54,782 --> 00:19:57,646
stuck on an out-of-the-way
trail with a broken ankle.

294
00:19:57,647 --> 00:19:58,540
So?

295
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,541
So... how did he know? How did he find them?

296
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,168
I don't know. Luck?

297
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,973
Maybe-Maybe we're jumping
the gun here, Allison.

298
00:20:08,794 --> 00:20:12,153
I mean, we can't even be sure that both of
these attacks were committed by the same person.

299
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:16,208
I mean, think about it, some
homicidal maniac gets this lucky twice.

300
00:20:16,325 --> 00:20:18,735
No, I know. You're right, it makes no sense.

301
00:20:19,757 --> 00:20:22,397
It doesn't make it any less tragic, but...

302
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,483
Looks like it's going to rain.

303
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:28,422
What do you want to do with the girls?

304
00:20:34,387 --> 00:20:36,350
Mom, I'm ready.

305
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,013
Coming. I'm coming.

306
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:42,543
You're late,Ms. Dubois.

307
00:20:42,986 --> 00:20:44,779
We're gonna have to mark you tardy.

308
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,104
I'll have my mommy write
me a note on Monday.

309
00:20:51,081 --> 00:20:52,493
Fire when ready.

310
00:20:54,664 --> 00:20:57,533
My mom's an investigator
for the District Attorney.

311
00:20:57,534 --> 00:21:00,444
The District Attorney is
a lawyer who works for the people.

312
00:21:00,445 --> 00:21:03,067
When someone is arrested
formurdering somebody,

313
00:21:03,068 --> 00:21:06,065
the District Attorney is
supposed to prove they did it.

314
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:09,261
This is lucky because it seems
like everywhere my mom goes

315
00:21:09,262 --> 00:21:11,964
she's always finding dead bodies.

316
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:17,740
A lot of times my mom's instincts tell her
where to be "to find dead bodies".

317
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:20,851
Just the other day, my mom said,
'Let's go for a hike.'

318
00:21:20,852 --> 00:21:22,697
We never go on hikes, but...

319
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:28,870
Oh, boy. Yep, I'm going to go get that.

320
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:33,332
-Hello.
- Bridge...

321
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:34,320
Good morning, sir.

322
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:36,807
Mommy doesn't see dead
bodies wherever she goes.

323
00:21:36,808 --> 00:21:39,578
Sure you do. Don't you remember?
That's what you told me.

324
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,900
No, honey,I never told you that.

325
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:42,920
Yes, you did.

326
00:21:42,921 --> 00:21:46,212
You said you listened to your instincts,
they tell you where to go,

327
00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:48,440
and that's where the dead bodies are.

328
00:21:48,543 --> 00:21:51,603
Al?  It's your boss.

329
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:53,268
Hold on.

330
00:21:58,418 --> 00:21:59,357
Hello.

331
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:02,272
Sorry to bother you on a wet Sunday, but...

332
00:22:02,328 --> 00:22:04,801
apparently the press is starting
to grab a hold of this thing,

333
00:22:04,802 --> 00:22:07,480
and the deputy mayor was
wondering if we could come in

334
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:09,548
and give her a quick briefing
on everything we know.

335
00:22:14,689 --> 00:22:15,973
When do you need me?

336
00:22:22,156 --> 00:22:23,601
They gave him a name?

337
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,016
Oh, yeah.

338
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,306
Why do they think it's one guy?

339
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:31,322
Honestly, I don't think there's a lot
of actual thinking going on here.

340
00:22:31,323 --> 00:22:35,024
Although, there is some reason to suspect
that we may be talking about a single individual.

341
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:36,276
What makes you say that?

342
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,943
It's not the greatest linkin the world, but

343
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,630
when we found that girl on the side
of the Sonoran Desert Highway,

344
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:48,527
there was a large recent oil spot
almost directly behind her car.

345
00:22:48,528 --> 00:22:50,786
We checked her under carriage
and it's tight as a drum.

346
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:54,174
So we went back to Mariposa
State Parkand wouldn't you know it?

347
00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:55,482
We found another large oil spot

348
00:22:55,783 --> 00:23:00,483
in one of the parking spaces located in the lot
closest to where that sorority girl was found.

349
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:01,759
And that proves?

350
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,960
Nothing.

351
00:23:03,304 --> 00:23:08,192
Lee, you know as well as I do that you can't
even be sure that oil came from the same car.

352
00:23:08,193 --> 00:23:09,834
As a clue, it's worthless.

353
00:23:09,835 --> 00:23:12,445
It's not like you can trace
the oil back to its owner.

354
00:23:12,446 --> 00:23:14,858
Hey, I'm not telling you it's not a straw.

355
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:17,385
And I'll be the first to admit
that we are grasping here.

356
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:19,638
This is ridiculous.
Has anyone looked at a map?

357
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:22,164
Did you see how far apart
these two incidents occurred?

358
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:23,125
About 60 miles.

359
00:23:23,126 --> 00:23:24,588
60 miles.

360
00:23:25,192 --> 00:23:28,330
In my opinion, Ms. Deputy Mayor,
the only responsible thing to do

361
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:31,589
is to call a press conference and
reassure the city that in all likeli hood,

362
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,345
these were two tragic,
separate and random acts of violence

363
00:23:35,346 --> 00:23:38,824
committed by two completely
different individuals...

364
00:23:39,142 --> 00:23:42,319
that the police department is doing
everything it can to find the guilty parties,

365
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,871
but that we are not looking at a murder spree
being perpetrated by some psychotic Bad Samaritan.

366
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:52,007
Hey, this is Cindy. Leave a message.

367
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:55,095
Cin, hey. It's Taylor. What's up?

368
00:23:55,763 --> 00:23:58,870
So, you know how my parents
went away this weekend and

369
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:02,824
I was totally psyched 'cause they finally
let me stay home alone this time?

370
00:24:03,617 --> 00:24:07,030
Um, well, maybe it's
not as cool as I thought.

371
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:10,862
'Cause honestly, it's kind
of creepy being here all alone.

372
00:24:12,012 --> 00:24:16,237
And I guess 'cause I watched this horror
movie on cable that was hella scary

373
00:24:16,592 --> 00:24:20,913
and now there's all this
lightning and thunder and...

374
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:24,373
This is going to sound kind of lame,

375
00:24:24,412 --> 00:24:28,447
and don't even repeat this to anyone
'cause if you do, I'll, like, totally deny it,

376
00:24:28,858 --> 00:24:32,587
but maybe you could come
crash here tonight?

377
00:24:32,588 --> 00:24:36,532
I know it's so weak, but I just
don't want to be here solo.

378
00:24:37,887 --> 00:24:43,559
Um, so anyway, it's 11:35 right now.
Um, you can call me at home, not my cell.

379
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,696
It's 555-0178.

380
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:49,866
555-0178.

381
00:24:50,228 --> 00:24:52,626
555-0178.

382
00:24:54,052 --> 00:24:57,068
555-0178...

383
00:24:57,548 --> 00:24:59,293
Come on, come on,come on, pick up.

384
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:02,399
H ello.

385
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,392
Taylor, hi. You don't know me.
My name is Allison Dubois.

386
00:25:05,393 --> 00:25:07,709
I work with the District
Attorney's office in Phoenix.

387
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,289
Don't ask me how, but I know
that you are home all alone.

388
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:12,624
Now I need you to listen.

389
00:25:12,694 --> 00:25:14,444
Who is this?

390
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:15,720
My name is Allison Dubois.

391
00:25:15,892 --> 00:25:17,511
Did Cindy tell you to call?

392
00:25:17,512 --> 00:25:20,399
No, Cindy didn't tell me to call.
I told you my name is Allison Dubois.

393
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,098
I think you might be in a lot of danger.

394
00:25:22,165 --> 00:25:23,911
I need you to give me your address.

395
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:29,075
And I need you to go around and make sure
all your doors and windows are locked.

396
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:31,588
Hello?

397
00:25:31,943 --> 00:25:34,321
-This isn't funny.
- I'm not trying to be funny!

398
00:25:34,623 --> 00:25:37,718
I need your address.
I need to know that you are going around

399
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:40,291
and locking all your doors and
windows so I can hang up with you

400
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:45,406
and I can call the police and
get them out there. Hello? Hello?

401
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:52,005
Phoenix Metro Police.
What's the nature of your emergency?

402
00:25:52,006 --> 00:25:53,450
My name is Allison Dubois.

403
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,594
I work with the Phoenix
District Attorney's office.

404
00:25:55,716 --> 00:26:00,305
I need the address of a house
whose phone number is 555-0178.

405
00:26:06,184 --> 00:26:08,662
Listen, butt brain, do not call here.

406
00:26:08,756 --> 00:26:09,899
Taylor Greene?

407
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:12,396
Yeah. Who's this?

408
00:26:12,397 --> 00:26:15,442
This is 911 dispatch.
We have a car coming your way.

409
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:22,035
A car? Why? We received a call coming
from someone in the District Attorney's office

410
00:26:22,036 --> 00:26:24,322
saying an intruder was trying
to break into your house.

411
00:26:26,407 --> 00:26:27,574
Hello?

412
00:26:27,575 --> 00:26:30,679
Hold on. Don't hang up.
I want to check some stuff.

413
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:34,907
Who was this who called you?

414
00:26:34,908 --> 00:26:38,509
I don't know, ma'am. Should I cancel the car or
would you like me to stay on the line with you?

415
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:42,184
- Stay on the line. Stay on the line.
- No problem. I'm right here.

416
00:26:43,605 --> 00:26:44,874
<i>Are you okay, ma'am?</i>

417
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,710
I'm here. Just don't hang up. Keep talking.

418
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:03,713
Hey, early bird.

419
00:27:03,812 --> 00:27:07,046
What you doing,worm-catching?

420
00:27:08,091 --> 00:27:09,527
He struck again.

421
00:27:10,065 --> 00:27:12,495
16-year-old girl home alone.

422
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:15,554
I called her right before he got there,
then I called the police.

423
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,769
Apparently, he was just about to break in,
but she surprised him and he fled.

424
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:24,360
There was an oil slick outside
her house at the curb.

425
00:27:24,455 --> 00:27:26,410
It's definitely the same guy.

426
00:27:30,725 --> 00:27:32,440
But that makes no sense.

427
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:35,069
I still don't get it.

428
00:27:35,093 --> 00:27:36,685
How does he find them?

429
00:27:37,742 --> 00:27:39,294
It can't be luck.

430
00:27:39,528 --> 00:27:42,057
Three vulnerable,isolated girls,

431
00:27:42,276 --> 00:27:46,012
totally different parts of
the city three times in a row.

432
00:27:46,486 --> 00:27:49,422
How could he have known
that this last girl was alone?

433
00:27:49,423 --> 00:27:51,593
Nobody could have known that but you.

434
00:27:52,023 --> 00:27:54,048
Or somebody like me.

435
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:58,009
<i>Yesterday, the Mayor's office assured us
that the killing spree was over,</i>

436
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,788
<i>that the two weekend
murders had no connection.</i>

437
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:03,057
<i>Today, a third apparent attack,</i>

438
00:28:03,186 --> 00:28:09,091
<i>and now a bizarre new twist in the serial murder
spree that has all of Phoenix in a state of panic.</i>

439
00:28:09,092 --> 00:28:11,802
<i>I was just lying in bed and this lady called</i>

440
00:28:11,813 --> 00:28:14,820
<i>and warned me to lock the doors
'cause someone was coming.</i>

441
00:28:15,132 --> 00:28:17,847
<i>Just like that, out of the blue?
You know who she was?</i>

442
00:28:19,594 --> 00:28:21,044
<i>Well, why did you believe her?</i>

443
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:23,071
<i>Um, I didn't at first,</i>

444
00:28:23,072 --> 00:28:28,386
<i>but then she said she worked for the District
Attorney's office and it sounded kinda serious.</i>

445
00:28:29,085 --> 00:28:31,200
<i>And then she said she
was going to send the police.</i>

446
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:33,162
<i>And a minute later the police were calling.</i>

447
00:28:33,272 --> 00:28:34,809
<i>And did you get this woman's name?</i>

448
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:40,520
<i>Um, I only got her first name...
Andrea or Allison. Something like that.</i>

449
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:42,343
<i>Who was this mystery caller?</i>

450
00:28:42,344 --> 00:28:48,512
<i>Your Action News Team  has made repeated
phone calls to the District Attorney's
office and gotten no response.</i>

451
00:28:48,513 --> 00:28:53,508
<i>And whoever she was, how was she able to warn
the young victim before the serial killer struck?</i>

452
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:56,678
<i>Could it be that the District Attorney,
the Mayor's office and</i>

453
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:00,018
<i>the Police Department know more
than they're letting on? Stay tune...</i>

454
00:29:00,154 --> 00:29:03,538
Every channel's running a version of the
same thing. The papers are full of it, too.

455
00:29:04,193 --> 00:29:07,608
I just got off the phone with the Mayor.
Everyone wants an explanation.

456
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,352
I think we have to give them one.

457
00:29:10,353 --> 00:29:14,664
Hello. Thank you for coming. My name is Allison
Dubois and I work as a freelance consultant

458
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:17,384
and investigator for the
District Attorney's office.

459
00:29:19,726 --> 00:29:25,136
There's been much recent speculation about who
in the District Attorney'soffice called Taylor Greene

460
00:29:25,674 --> 00:29:28,477
to warn her that someone was
trying to break into her house,

461
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,547
and how this caller
obtained this information.

462
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:40,646
You might be surprised
by my answer... luck.

463
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:45,487
I'd been working late on,
of all things, the Bad Samaritan case

464
00:29:45,488 --> 00:29:49,119
and I was driving home from work
when I passed Ms. Greene's house.

465
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:57,662
I saw a figure lurking about the perimeter of the
house and it looked like a burglar,so I called 911.

466
00:29:57,979 --> 00:29:59,990
They promised to senda police car.

467
00:30:00,074 --> 00:30:02,875
Concerned about the safety of
whoever might have been in the house,

468
00:30:02,876 --> 00:30:08,391
I requested a reverse phone number
lookup from Ms. Greene's street address

469
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:10,709
and was immediately connected
to her home phone.

470
00:30:11,304 --> 00:30:14,261
Like I said... luck.

471
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:18,668
But let me take this moment
to clear up another misconception.

472
00:30:18,811 --> 00:30:20,798
We cannot be certain at this time

473
00:30:20,997 --> 00:30:23,181
that the man who fled Ms. Greene's house

474
00:30:23,182 --> 00:30:27,978
is the same person responsible
for this weekend's two murders.

475
00:30:28,072 --> 00:30:31,910
Naturally, we're using Ms. Greene's
description of the suspect and working

476
00:30:31,911 --> 00:30:34,874
in conjunction  with the Phoenix
police to help apprehend him.

477
00:30:35,106 --> 00:30:36,049
Thank you.

478
00:30:37,023 --> 00:30:38,703
Mom, you lied.

479
00:30:39,242 --> 00:30:40,623
I didn't lie.

480
00:30:40,624 --> 00:30:43,878
We don't know that those three
incidents were the work of one man.

481
00:30:44,372 --> 00:30:46,603
Everybody has an opinion. I have an opinion,

482
00:30:46,947 --> 00:30:50,266
but since the Mayor went ahead and told everybody
that he didn't thinkthere was a connection...

483
00:30:50,597 --> 00:30:51,815
That's not what she meant.

484
00:30:53,616 --> 00:30:55,188
You weren't working last night.

485
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:58,919
You didn't drive by that girl's house.
Why did you say that you did?

486
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:01,567
How did you know that
that man would break in?

487
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,762
Girls, Mommy works for someone.
When you workfor someone...

488
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:05,692
Joe.

489
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:15,801
Ariel's right.

490
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:22,011
I lied, and that is really not something
that I want to teach you girls.

491
00:31:23,372 --> 00:31:27,821
And to answer your question,I don't know.

492
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:33,594
I don't know how I knew that man
was going to beoutside that girl's house.

493
00:31:34,622 --> 00:31:36,398
I just did.

494
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:39,753
That happens to me sometimes.

495
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,526
I see something.

496
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:45,612
I just know things. I just sense things.

497
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,269
I don't get to pick and
choose what they are.

498
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:56,751
And I have learned most
people don't understand it.

499
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,276
So it's not something that I talk about.

500
00:32:00,277 --> 00:32:02,410
It's not something that I try to explain.

501
00:32:05,335 --> 00:32:09,435
Do you girls understand
what Mommy's saying to you?

502
00:32:09,436 --> 00:32:12,196
I know you girls know
what I'm talking about.

503
00:32:14,744 --> 00:32:18,545
I think a little bit of what
I have has rubbed off on you.

504
00:32:18,976 --> 00:32:21,482
I know that you've felt this thing.

505
00:32:22,245 --> 00:32:27,205
But you have to trust me when I tell you
very few people ever experience it.

506
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:30,891
And very few people understand it.

507
00:32:31,024 --> 00:32:33,947
Which is why,for the moment at least,

508
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:40,649
only you and Daddy and
a couple of people at work know.

509
00:32:41,598 --> 00:32:44,812
And I'm asking you,just for the time being,

510
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:48,466
don't tell your friends.

511
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:51,851
Don't talk about it at school.

512
00:32:51,852 --> 00:32:53,690
Don't share it with anyone.

513
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,088
Is that an order?

514
00:32:57,804 --> 00:33:00,746
No, honey. No.

515
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,912
It's just a suggestion. It's just a hope.

516
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,636
No parent has the final word on what
their children say about them. It's just...

517
00:33:12,939 --> 00:33:15,758
People just don't understand it.

518
00:33:16,723 --> 00:33:22,157
And I really don't want them treating
you differently because of the way I am.

519
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:32,252
Now, come on, give me a kiss.
Let's get ready for bed.

520
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:43,858
What do you think?

521
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:45,916
About what?

522
00:33:46,355 --> 00:33:48,659
Tomorrow is Bridgette's report.

523
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,849
If she's going to say something,
tomorrow's the day.

524
00:33:52,386 --> 00:33:54,111
I don't know.
What do you think?

525
00:33:54,114 --> 00:33:56,554
I thought you were amazing.

526
00:33:57,053 --> 00:34:01,579
I thought you said everything
just about perfectly.

527
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:06,820
I guess the rest is up to her.
And I think I'm allright with that.

528
00:34:09,862 --> 00:34:11,629
I wish I didn't lie.

529
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:15,171
Well, you didn't lie.

530
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,899
You told a fib.

531
00:34:17,007 --> 00:34:20,642
And you didn't fib to the girls.
You told them the truth.

532
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:23,598
And I think that is what
they're going to remember.

533
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:26,305
I hope you're right.

534
00:34:31,004 --> 00:34:32,437
What's so funny?

535
00:34:32,824 --> 00:34:34,876
Today. This day.

536
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:40,335
For all of my "gifts," 
I didn't see this one coming.

537
00:34:41,753 --> 00:34:45,345
Helping that girl last night.
Devalos calling a press conference.

538
00:34:46,032 --> 00:34:48,955
The conversation with the girls.

539
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:51,583
This life thing is a tricky business.

540
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:54,779
Keep looking for a batting order,
a table of contents...

541
00:34:55,651 --> 00:34:58,339
something to let you know
what's happening next.

542
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,936
Hello.

543
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,681
Is this Allison Dubois?

544
00:35:07,717 --> 00:35:09,820
Uh, may I ask who's calling?

545
00:35:09,821 --> 00:35:11,465
You don't know me.

546
00:35:11,552 --> 00:35:15,781
I just saw you on the news, and I wanted
to call and tell you how impressed I was.

547
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:18,986
Who is that?

548
00:35:19,162 --> 00:35:21,696
I'm sorry...
didn't catch your name.

549
00:35:21,796 --> 00:35:23,961
That's because I didn't tell you my name.

550
00:35:24,712 --> 00:35:26,490
That was quite a story.

551
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,839
The one about passing
the house and seeing me.

552
00:35:29,706 --> 00:35:30,778
It's him.

553
00:35:33,837 --> 00:35:35,842
Really, who is this?

554
00:35:36,161 --> 00:35:39,444
You tell me. You're the dreamer.

555
00:35:39,668 --> 00:35:41,585
You're the one who sees things.

556
00:35:42,437 --> 00:35:47,786
It was funny and strange watching TV
and seeing someone else who had it.

557
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:51,494
Spent my whole life looking.
Never found anyone.

558
00:35:51,495 --> 00:35:54,059
And then there you were on the television.

559
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,885
Someone else who can do it.

560
00:35:55,886 --> 00:35:58,415
Someone else who gets the dreams.

561
00:35:59,462 --> 00:36:02,164
You know, when I get off this phone,
I'm going to have them trace this call.

562
00:36:02,165 --> 00:36:04,603
Oh, I'm counting on it.

563
00:36:04,857 --> 00:36:08,890
And you know, as soon as I get off this call
I'm going to throw away this cell phone.

564
00:36:09,264 --> 00:36:14,578
Well, I mean, you know... after I pull
away from the front of your house.

565
00:36:16,352 --> 00:36:18,543
Al, what's going on?

566
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,822
Oil.

567
00:36:27,043 --> 00:36:30,138
Oh, my God,he knows where we live.

568
00:36:34,286 --> 00:36:35,511
It's like your boss said...

569
00:36:35,512 --> 00:36:37,560
I can't trace the oil back to its owner.

570
00:36:38,128 --> 00:36:40,099
I will trace and find that cell phone.

571
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,485
If he bought it on credit or left a
finger print on it, we'll find that, too.

572
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,067
But short of that...

573
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:48,864
Well, what about tonight,
what about tomorrow?

574
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:51,875
I'm concerned about my family.

575
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:57,235
I'm going to leave a couple uniforms
and a cruiser outside to stand watch.

576
00:36:58,645 --> 00:37:00,467
If you're out and about and
somebody looks at you funny,

577
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,972
somebody makes you feel nervous, call me.

578
00:37:02,976 --> 00:37:05,119
I'll have an officer there
before we're off the phone.

579
00:37:07,238 --> 00:37:11,021
My guess is, he's on his way to
California by now, or New Mexico.

580
00:37:11,157 --> 00:37:14,142
We've alerted the authorities in those states.
We've set up road blocks.

581
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:17,492
But nobody quite knows
who we're looking for,

582
00:37:17,493 --> 00:37:19,830
so it's hard to say how
effective they'll be.

583
00:37:23,262 --> 00:37:24,952
You holding up okay?

584
00:37:27,002 --> 00:37:29,355
It was scary that he was so close.

585
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,443
I'm just amazed that my kids
have slept through this.

586
00:37:37,044 --> 00:37:38,969
He sees the min his dreams, huh?

587
00:37:40,544 --> 00:37:43,205
It's too bad we couldn't get
the bastard to work for our side.

588
00:37:47,287 --> 00:37:48,728
Give me five more minutes.

589
00:37:48,729 --> 00:37:51,403
I'll have my guys out of here
and you two can go back to bed.

590
00:38:06,771 --> 00:38:09,324
The whole house is full of police.

591
00:38:10,225 --> 00:38:12,380
What are you talking about?

592
00:38:12,438 --> 00:38:15,754
I think I liked it all better
when Mommy wasn't special.

593
00:38:15,783 --> 00:38:19,041
I think I liked it all better
when Mommy was just Mommy.

594
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:22,668
Mommy is just Mommy.

595
00:38:27,147 --> 00:38:28,762
Want to hop in here?

596
00:39:07,133 --> 00:39:10,925
I believe that when people are
alone and vulnerableand afraid,

597
00:39:11,824 --> 00:39:16,324
they put out a sort of distress signal,

598
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,824
an alarm of sorts.

599
00:39:20,014 --> 00:39:21,804
An S.O.S.

600
00:39:22,189 --> 00:39:24,229
It's not visible or audible.

601
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:29,883
At least not to everyone.
Just certain people.

602
00:39:41,994 --> 00:39:44,787
What's going on? You all right?

603
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:47,249
I'm good. I'm great.

604
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:49,566
Everything's going to be just fine.

605
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:52,424
- Yeah?
- Lee, it's Allison.

606
00:39:52,793 --> 00:39:54,320
I know where he is.

607
00:39:55,944 --> 00:40:00,685
And now we get to hear from
someone I know I'm looking forward to.

608
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:05,115
Her mommy has been in
the newspaper and on TV,

609
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:09,416
and this morning I heard she was involved
in catching a really dangerous criminal

610
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:11,677
as he fled the state last night.

611
00:40:11,913 --> 00:40:14,930
So let's hear from Bridgette Dubois.

612
00:40:33,261 --> 00:40:37,137
My mom is an investigator for the
dis...for the District Attorney.

613
00:40:37,138 --> 00:40:40,032
The District Attorney is a lawyer
who works for the people.

614
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:42,764
when someone is arrested
for doing something bad.

615
00:40:42,765 --> 00:40:45,450
The District Attorney is
supposed to prove they did it.

616
00:40:45,556 --> 00:40:47,115
My mom helps with this.

617
00:40:47,116 --> 00:40:50,430
You ask her how she helps,
she'll tell you she doesn't really know.

618
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:52,504
"I just know that when she's done,

619
00:40:52,505 --> 00:40:57,124
she comes home and gets to be
with me and my sisters and my dad.

620
00:40:57,315 --> 00:41:01,034
She's a really good investigator,
but she's a really great mom.

621
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:05,001
And I keep thinking, if people
would just stop doing bad things,

622
00:41:05,002 --> 00:41:08,555
maybe she could stay home
and be a mom all the time."

623
00:41:25,431 --> 00:41:27,093
Morning, Mom.Did you sleep good?

624
00:41:27,094 --> 00:41:28,896
Actually, I did. How about you?

625
00:41:28,897 --> 00:41:31,695
Yeah. Really good. I even had a good dream.

626
00:41:31,696 --> 00:41:33,292
A good dream? Really?

627
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:37,311
Uh-huh. It helped me figure out
something that was bothering me.

628
00:41:37,577 --> 00:41:39,382
I had one of those, too.

629
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,757
What was yours about?

630
00:41:43,058 --> 00:41:45,558
