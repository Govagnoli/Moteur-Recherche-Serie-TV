1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,600
Your aspirin, mademoiselle.

2
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,000
I was starting to think
you'd forgotten about me.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,400
I was just looking for
a store that was still
open, that's all.

4
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,700
Must be some headache.

5
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,800
Can't even kiss your husband

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,000
in the most beautiful city
on Earth.

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,700
This isn't right, Kent.

8
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,200
It's springtime in Paris.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,300
We're in the same room
we honeymooned in.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,500
Come on, maybe
a little Chardonnay

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,800
will put you in
a better mood.

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,700
To us.

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,000
To us.

14
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,000
JOE (groggily):
You all right?

15
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,900
What's going on?

16
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,600
Were you dreaming again?

17
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,800
An American couple in Paris...

18
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,600
The wife ended up

19
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,500
stabbing the husband through
the hand with a corkscrew.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,900
I don't know what to tell you.

21
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,500
I don't think 'em up.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,500
BRIDGETTE:
Three tenths...

26
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,500
Two twelfths, whic
really one sixth.

27
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,800
Um...

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,000
Can you give me a clue?

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's a math problem, doofus.

30
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,800
So?

31
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,600
So, there are
no clues in math.

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
You either know
the answer or you don't.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,600
Mommy, I don't like doing
flash cards with Ariel.

34
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,500
I'd rather do them with Daddy.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,900
Sorry, kiddo.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,400
Your dad is getting ready
for a big job interview.

37
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,200
It's your sister
or nothing this morning.

38
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
You ready for
a good luck kiss?

39
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,000
Why don't you tell me,
do I look ready?

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,900
Let's see.

41
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,400
Ooh, you look good.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,600
Highly employable.

43
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Oh, yeah?

44
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,400
Absolutely.

45
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,500
If I was the president of
a big aerospace company,

46
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,500
I would definitely
hire you-- definitely.

47
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,300
All right. Okay.

48
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,200
From your lips.

49
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,500
Don't be such
a fatalist.

50
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,500
I'm not a fatalist,
I'm a realist.

51
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,400
I mean, aside from Aerodytech,

52
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,900
aside from the company
that fired me,

53
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,700
there are only two
other firms in Phoenix

54
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,400
that do anything
even remotely related

55
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,500
to the kind of work
that I do.

56
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,600
And one of them
is laying people off.

57
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,000
This may literally be the
last engineering job in town.

58
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
That's okay.
You only need one.

59
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,400
You're a brilliant man,
Mr. Dubois.

60
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,400
I've been following your career
for some time.

61
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,300
We'd be lucky to have you.

62
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,000
And that would be that,
except that, for some reason,

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,800
at this particular
 moment in time,

64
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,200
there are also two or three
other engineers

65
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,600
who I expect we'd be
lucky to have

66
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,100
and I've yet to meet with them.

67
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,900
So I'm going
to have to ask you

68
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,700
to be patient,
bear with me.

69
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,900
May take me a week or two
to identify just who it is

70
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,500
I'm going to ask to join us.

71
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,700
Of course.
I understand completely.

72
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,000
It's a big decision.

73
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,800
For both of us.

74
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,000
Now that we got that
out of the way,

75
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,300
I have to ask you, um...

76
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,000
kind of a peculiar question.

77
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Okay.

78
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,100
Your wife-- she wouldn't,
by any chance,

79
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,300
be the Dubois woman who was
on the news earlier this year?

80
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,100
Why? Is that going
to be a problem?

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Depends what you
consider a problem.

82
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,300
My wife followed
that story very closely.

83
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,600
When I told her I was meeting
with you this morning

84
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,300
she made me promise
I'd find out.

85
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,400
Well, please tell your wife
I am married to Allison Dubois.

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,200
And she is the woman that
they were writing about.

87
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Frankly, I take issue
with a lot of the things

88
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,500
that were said, a lot of
the things that were implied.

89
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,900
Well, it can't be easy.

90
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,900
For you or her.

91
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
For what it's worth,
my wife is a big believer.

92
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,900
And her husband?

93
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,600
Well, I'm a big believer
in my wife.

94
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,300
Which brings me to
my next peculiar question.

95
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,300
What are the two of you
doing this evening?

96
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,700
JOE:
Hey.

97
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,300
Hey. How'd it go?

98
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,800
Honestly, it's a little
hard to say.

99
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,100
But I need a favor.

100
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
So let me get
this straight--

101
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,100
they're having a party
at their house.

102
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,500
It's kind of
a charity thing.

103
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,200
Tonight.

104
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,500
I know, it's a
little bit odd.

105
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,700
And your new boss?

106
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
He's not
my boss yet.

107
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,800
Right, not your boss yet--

108
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,800
wants us to come
to this party

109
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,600
because his wife
thinks I'm interesting.

110
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,000
Uh, you make that sound
like it's a bad thing.

111
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,800
Well, just so you know,
it feels like a bad thing.

112
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,600
I'm not a freak,
I'm not an oddity,

113
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,200
I'm not a science experiment.

114
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,300
I don't even know what you're
talking about now.

115
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,200
What is going to be
expected of us

116
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,000
when we go to this party?

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,500
What is she expecting
me to do?

118
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,000
Do? I don't know-- eat,
drink, maybe be merry.

119
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,800
And you're fairly sure
her idea of merriment

120
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,300
doesn't include me sitting
in the corner reading tea leaves

121
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,300
or telling a fortune or two?

122
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,400
Allison, this man that I met
today, Pet Peter Barrister--

123
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
he strikes me as a fairly
sophisticated man.

124
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,800
I've got to believe that if he's
looking for party entertainers

125
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,100
he has the means
and the wherewithal

126
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,400
to find them on his own.

127
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,500
I honestly think
that his wife

128
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,400
is legitimately
interested in you.

129
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,300
Which is another way of saying
that you are someone

130
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,300
that she would love
to meet, period.

131
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,600
Now, if you don't want
to go to this party,

132
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,400
I guess we won't go
to this party.

133
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,100
But I got to
tell you, finally,

134
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,600
you doing what you do
and you being who you are,

135
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,000
has the potential of
giving us-- giving me--

136
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,400
a leg up in a situation
where I could use it.

137
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,800
Now, he's interviewing
two other people.

138
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,800
I'm betting neither of them
are married to a famous psychic.

139
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,500
I'll tell Ariel that
she's babysitting.

140
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,900
We need a signal.

141
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,300
Hmm? What do you mean?

142
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,600
Well, what if we do if
Mrs. Barrister corners me

143
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,000
tries to get me, you know,
to guess people's birthdays

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,600
or the future...
I don't know.

145
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,100
Hmm, let me see...

146
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,900
Why don't you just give me
that look you always give me

147
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,500
and then I'll, uh, interject
myself in the situation.

148
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,600
I'll know what to do.
What are you talking
about? What look?

149
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,300
I don't know what look
you're talking about.

150
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,000
You know, I think you're
intentionally being vague

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,200
because you actually
find this situation amusing.

152
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,400
Well, it's not amusing.

153
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Not to me.

154
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,500
Yeah, that's the one.

155
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,800
Oh, hi.

156
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,300
Hi. Hello.
Hi, um...

157
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm Joe...

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Joe Dubois. Yeah, I recognize
your wife

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,600
from the newspaper.

160
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,500
You must get that
all the time.
Allison.

161
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm Bonnie Barrister.

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,400
I'm so excited that you're here.

163
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,200
Come on in.

164
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,400
We're thrilled
to be here.

165
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,700
Oh, please, come in,
make yourself at home.

166
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,400
JOE:
Thank you.

167
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,900
There's a bar in the next room,
and there's food as well.

168
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,500
Peter is around
here somewhere.

169
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,800
I have to iron out
a few wrinkles

170
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,900
with the caterer, but after
I'm through

171
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,200
I plan on finding you.

172
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,300
I'll be here.
Wonderful.

173
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Wonderful.

174
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,600
You're not fooling me.

175
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,900
That's not the look.

176
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,000
I see you've been abandoned.

177
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,500
Uh, no, he's just...
hunting and gathering.

178
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,600
(laughing):
Oh, my.

179
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,800
Does that make my
husband his prey?

180
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,800
(laughing)
I hope Chardonnay's okay.

181
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,600
Thank you.

182
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,100
For what it's worth,

183
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,400
ow Peter's very taken
with your husband.

184
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,900
Not just because
I'm taken with you.

185
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,900
I have to be honest
with you, Allison.

186
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,900
I don't know how
you can live with it.

187
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,900
I'm sorry. Live with what?

188
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,900
With this city
and the people in it.

189
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,800
The way they treated you,

190
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,200
the way they treated
the district attorney.

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,800
I followed that story
like a hawk.

192
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,500
You said that that man,
Walter Paxton,

193
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
murdered his wife and he did.

194
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,600
You said that the reporter,
P.D. McCall,

195
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,900
would get killed,
and she was.

196
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,000
And you found the evidence
to put Paxton away, you did.

197
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
And then it was as if
it never happened.

198
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,500
The district attorney was gone,

199
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,300
and you were treated
in the press

200
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,700
like some kind of pariah.

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,100
Or worse--
some kind of nut.

202
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,400
But you were right
about everything.

203
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,800
Thank you.

204
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,600
Oh, there's Melissa.

205
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,700
Have you met
my daughter Melissa?

206
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,500
No, I don't believe I have.

207
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,200
Oh, I would love for her
to meet you.

208
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,200
She's listened to me
talk about you

209
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,600
for quite a while now.

210
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,200
And besides, she's getting
married next month.

211
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,400
Oh, congratulations.

212
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,700
She is gonna get such
a kick out of this.

213
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,600
Just let me know
if you have any
premonitions.

214
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,100
Oh, what do you mean?

215
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh, wedding-day disasters, um,

216
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,900
how many grandkids I can expect,

217
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,900
that kind of thing.

218
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,800
Bonnie, I need to let you know
it doesn't really work that way.

219
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,700
I'm joking, Allison.

220
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,700
I know she's here somewhere.

221
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,800
Oh, here's Melissa,

222
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,200
right over there.

223
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,800
Don't do this.

224
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,700
Oh, my God, how do I not?

225
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,600
How do you not?

226
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,800
Al, come on! You're talking
about something that,

227
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,100
if it happens at all,
probably won't happen for years.

228
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,800
I mean, look at her.
She's fine now.

229
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,200
JOE:
She's happy now.

230
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,700
She's not in Paris.

231
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,300
She's nowhere near
a corkscrew.

232
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,100
Hell, she's not even
married yet.

233
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,300
What's the harm
in just letting her
enjoy this party?

234
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,800
Are we in agreement?

235
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,600
Are we in agreement
about what?

236
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,900
About not saying anything--
not tonight.

237
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,400
'Cause I really don't think
that's gonna help my cause.

238
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,300
BONNIE:
Allison,

239
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
you took off so suddenly.
Are you okay?

240
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah. Uh, no.

241
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,600
I get headaches
sometimes.

242
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,400
Well, if you'd like,

243
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sure we have some aspirin
upstairs.

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,400
Oh, no, no.
I'm fine.

245
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,800
Bonnie, who...

246
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,400
who's that man
with Melissa?

247
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,700
Oh, that?

248
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,700
That's Steven,
Melissa's fiance.

249
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,900
That's her fiance?

250
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
This isn't right, Kent.

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,500
Okay, wait, wait.
Who's Kent?

252
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,900
I overheard somebody earlier
mention a Kent.

253
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,200
Oh, Kent. God, no. Kent was
Melissa's first husband.

254
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,700
She was married before?

255
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,300
Three years.
Three horrible years.

256
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,500
They didn't happen,
by any chance,

257
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
to have honeymooned
in Paris?

258
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,400
That's very good.

259
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,400
Isn't she something?

260
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,400
(chuckles)
Come on,
admit it.

261
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,900
That was the most fun
you've had with your clothes on

262
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,300
in a very long time.

263
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,700
Don't push your luck, buster.

264
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,600
You don't fool me,
uh-uh.

265
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,000
I saw smiles.

266
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,800
I saw phone numbers
being exchanged

267
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,600
and I saw
a kiss good-bye.

268
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,700
All right.

269
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,000
I was just trying
to help my deadbeat
husband get a job.

270
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,600
Yeah? Well, all right.

271
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,100
Methinks she doth
protest too much.

272
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,600
Okay, I admit it.

273
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,000
I liked her.

274
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,900
She wasn't
what I expected.

275
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,700
She was smart
and she was nice
and she liked me.

276
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,800
Bingo.

277
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,400
Isn't that every one

278
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,800
of your minimum
requirements for
friendship?

279
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,800
Yeah, I'm pretty easy,
aren't I?

280
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,600
I liked
the husband, too.

281
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,400
In fact, I even
like the daughter.

282
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,000
I know. She seemed
rather pleasant

283
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,300
for somebody given
to impaling her exes.

284
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,400
Whatever she was going through,
whatever drove her to do that

285
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,200
to her first husband,

286
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,700
it seemed like she put it
all behind her.

287
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
It seemed like it was
ancient history.

288
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,800
Yeah.

289
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,100
Thank you.

290
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,300
For what?

291
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,500
For going.

292
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,100
Peter took me aside
and he said that he wants

293
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,400
to have a second interview
with me tomorrow.

294
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,000
You're kidding!

295
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,500
When were you gonna tell me?

296
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,400
I don't know. I think I was
afraid to say it out loud.

297
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,100
I think I was afraid to jinx it.

298
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,900
I think I want this job
very badly.

299
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,500
I think
you're gonna get this job.

300
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,300
Do you mean you know
that I'm gonna get this job?

301
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,600
I don't know anything.

302
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,800
I just think that there's
nobody who deserves it

303
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,300
more than you do.

304
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,100
Bingo.
You just met every one

305
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,800
of my minimum requirements
for friendship.

306
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,300
Hmm, cool.

307
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,400
Hmm.

308
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,300
Mm...

309
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,600
I didn't want to
hurt you, Kent...

310
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,800
...but I'm not gonna
pretend anymore.

311
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,400
I'm not gonna keep
playing this game with you.

312
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,300
This whole thing
was a mistake.

313
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,200
Yeah?

314
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,300
I'm starting to sense that.

315
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,600
Paris was a bad idea.

316
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,800
Maybe I should have gone
with the cabin--

317
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,600
our secret hideaway--

318
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,900
but I know how much
you love that place.

319
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,100
I'm not mad, Melissa,

320
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,300
I swear.

321
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,200
I just want you
to put that down

322
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,900
before you hurt yourself,
all right?

323
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,100
It's okay, honey.

324
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,500
It's okay.

325
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,700
We made it through
so much before.

326
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,000
We're gonna make it
through this, too.

327
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,200
I still love you.

328
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,900
Ooh!

329
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,800
You okay?
Is everything
all right?

330
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,000
Oh, yeah, yeah...

331
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,100
No, no, it's nothing.

332
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,200
I'm fine.

333
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,500
Just more ancient history.

334
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
It's... nothing.

335
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,100
Hello.

336
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,700
Dad, it's for you!

337
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,800
Hello.

338
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,900
Hi, Peter.

339
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,600
We have three kids.

340
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,300
There's no such thing
as too early.

341
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,700
"Family crisis,"
that's all he said?

342
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
That's it.

343
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,000
That and "Is there any
way that you and Allison

344
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,200
can come up
to the house?"

345
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,300
Oh, Allison, Joe, I can't
thank you enough for coming.

346
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,700
It's been
a rough morning.

347
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,900
PETER:
My daughter and future
son-in-law live in Los Angeles.

348
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,900
As it happens,
Steven had to fly back

349
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,000
after the party
last night.

350
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,200
Some kind of a
emergency meeting

351
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,600
with one of his clients
this morning.

352
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Melissa was going to spend
a few more nights,

353
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,000
finalize all the wedding
plans with me, but...

354
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,900
PETER:
When we went out

355
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,900
to the guest house to get
Melissa for breakfast,

356
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,300
the guest house was empty.

357
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,900
Her things were gone,
so was she.

358
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,400
And I found
this message

359
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,900
on my phone: "Mom,
I hate to do this to you,

360
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,100
"but I need some time
to think.

361
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,200
"I'm just not sure
that I can go through
with the wedding.

362
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,500
"Please, don't try
to find me.

363
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,400
I'll keep in touch
en I can."

364
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,800
Does her fiance know?

365
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,600
I called him right before
I called you.

366
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,700
He's a mess.

367
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,900
I called the police.

368
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,200
Of course, she's an adult.

369
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,100
She's allowed to come and go
as she pleases.

370
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Allison, I...

371
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,000
I don't mean to put you
on the spot, but...

372
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,500
I know from all the articles
I've read

373
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,500
that you've helped the police
find missing people before.

374
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,100
You dream about them, right?

375
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Yes, but...

376
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,400
I thought
if you found her,

377
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,700
I could talk some sense
into her,

378
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,500
convince her that she's making
a terrible mistake.

379
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,900
She's done this before--

380
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,800
run away when
there's a lot
of pressure.

381
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,600
Bonnie, but what I need you

382
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,900
to understand is the impressions
I get, the things that I see,

383
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,700
I can't count on them to
point me toward your daughter

384
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,300
just because I want them to.

385
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,100
Look, uh, true confession time.

386
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,600
I'm fundamentally a skeptic
about these sorts of things.

387
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,200
I've already been
on the phone

388
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,000
with a number of
private investigators.

389
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,700
Having said that,

390
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,200
we obviouslyant
to make sure

391
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,400
we've left no
stone unturned.

392
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,100
Allison, I promise you,
if you come up empty,

393
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,900
if you come up dry,
I'll understand.

394
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,900
I mean, you only
just met her last night,

395
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,900
and briefly at that.

396
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,600
I really do understand.

397
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,500
I mean, it's not like
you've been dreaming
about her.

398
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,100
(voice breaking):
It's not like she's on

399
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,800
your wavelength
or anything.

400
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,500
Well, I guess
you're helping
the Barristers.

401
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,100
I mean, what else could I say?

402
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,100
She's desperate, and so nice.

403
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,700
I <i>have</i> been dreaming
about her daughter. I <i>have.</i>

404
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,000
And you're trying to get
a job from her husband.

405
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,800
And I just... I... I didn't feel

406
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,900
like there was anything else
I <i>could</i> say.

407
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,300
I mean, it's true.

408
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,800
All the dreams
I've had about her

409
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
have been about her past.

410
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,600
But still, I mean,
what else could I say?

411
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,700
You said the only
thing you could say.

412
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
Thank you.

413
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,300
And, just remember,
if we ever hope

414
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,800
to send our three
girls to college,

415
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,900
you damn well
better find her.

416
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,400
Okay. How about this?

417
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,100
Is it possible
that you've dreaming about Paris

418
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,500
because that's
where Melissa's run off to?

419
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,700
That makes no sense.

420
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,400
Makes sense to me.
Oh, come on.

421
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,800
What woman in her right mind

422
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,400
would go to the place where
her first marriage fell apart

423
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,900
to figure out whether or not
to get married a second time?

424
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Moving on.

425
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,700
What else do you remember
from that first dream?

426
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,600
Well, she was upset.

427
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,600
She didn't want to be there--
Paris, I mean.

428
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,800
That's it?

429
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,400
That's it.

430
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,000
He poured her a glass of wine,

431
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,200
she stabbed him through
the hand with a corkscrew.

432
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,500
Those are the highlights.

433
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,700
What?

434
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,400
That's all right.

435
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,000
I didn't want
to work there, anyway.

436
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,200
All right, that's not fair.

437
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,700
It's not my fault
that the dreams I'm having

438
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,600
have nothing to do
with where she is now.

439
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,900
The second one
same as the first?

440
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,800
Yes. Second one
same as the first.

441
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,100
Corkscrew through hand.

442
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,800
Smashed bottle against wall.

443
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,300
Sounds romantic.

444
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,500
She said that Paris
had been a mistake.

445
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,100
He said they should
have gone to the cabin.

446
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,400
What?

447
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,900
He called it
their secret hideaway.

448
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,800
The cabin.
That's what he called it.

449
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,400
Did either of them happen
to mention where it was?

450
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm going to call Peter.

451
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,500
He's not going to
know where it is.

452
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,900
It's a secret hideaway.

453
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,000
Yeah, well, maybe he can
help us find his ex-son-in-law.

454
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,600
He's <i>got</i> to know where it is.

455
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,000
It was his secret.

456
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,100
I hate these foreground trees.

457
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,500
I hated them yesterday,
ill hate them today.

458
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,600
Mr. Henley?

459
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,800
Hi. My name's Allison Dubois.

460
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,300
I spoke with your receptionist
about an hour ago.

461
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,200
Oh, right, uh... yeah.
Bonnie and Peter's friend.

462
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,900
Have we met before?

463
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,000
Maybe one
of their parties?

464
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,500
You look
awfully familiar.

465
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,700
Mrs. Dubois?

466
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,100
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

467
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,000
Bonnie tried to tell me
what exactly it was
you did for a living,

468
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,900
and I didn't get it.

469
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
This is it.

470
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,000
This and six other buildings
like it.

471
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,700
We design and create exhibits

472
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,400
for museums and exhibitions
all over the world.

473
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,600
That's very
impressive.

474
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,600
Thank you.

475
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,700
This is one of those days

476
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,300
where I feel like an
overpaid window dresser.

477
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,700
So thank you.

478
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,300
Now, what can
I do for you?

479
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,500
Are you shopping
for a life-sized,

480
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,300
historical diorama
of your very own?

481
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,400
Or is there something else
I can help you with today?

482
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,300
Mr. Henley, actually,
I was hoping

483
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,900
to talk to you
about your ex-wife.

484
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,800
She's missing.

485
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,500
"Missing" may be overstating it.

486
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,400
Uh, she ran away.

487
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,500
Her parents are very
concerned about her.

488
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,700
Sounds like my Melissa.

489
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,300
So what scared her off
this time?

490
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,700
I don't know how
much you know.

491
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,700
I don't know how much the two
of you have kept in contact.

492
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,900
She's planning on getting
married next month.

493
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,700
Mel and I haven't spoken
in years.

494
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,700
I needed to do some healing
after our marriage ended.

495
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,600
And for my own peace of mind

496
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,800
I just had to cut off contact
for a little while.

497
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,800
I understand.

498
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,200
I'm sorry-- I didn't mean to
stir up any painful memories.

499
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,200
Just no one else seems to know
where she might be.

500
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,000
So you thought you'd come
to the last guy

501
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,100
that Melissa ran out on,

502
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,700
and see if he could
shed any light.

503
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,600
I know the two of
you had a cabin.

504
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,800
Now I know where
I know you from.

505
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,800
You were in the papers
a while back.

506
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,800
You worked with that
district attorney, right?

507
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,300
The one who messed up
the serial killer thing?

508
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,900
Well, same old Bonnie.

509
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,900
Leave it to her
to find someone like you

510
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,500
to help her
with Melissa.

511
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,700
Now what did you say?

512
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,200
That we had a cabin?

513
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,100
No. We didn't
have a cabin.

514
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,100
There was a cabin
that we rented,

515
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,600
that Melissa really liked.

516
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
It was on Lake Mead.

517
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,700
And I think
she liked it so much

518
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,200
because her parents
didn't know about it.

519
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,600
It was kind of
our secret hideaway.

520
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,500
Is that where you think
she might be?

521
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,500
I'm not sure.

522
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,700
I'm just trying to help.

523
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,700
We went there maybe
three or four times,

524
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,800
but Melissa handled
all the arrangements,

525
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,500
so I don't even remember
the address.

526
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,400
I'm sorry.

527
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,000
The owner's first name
was Chuck, I think.

528
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,100
Sorry.

529
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,100
I know Peter and Bonnie are
probably beside themselves.

530
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,600
But she'll turn up.

531
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,900
She always does.

532
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,000
Say hi to them for me,
will you?

533
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,600
Yeah. Thank you.

534
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,900
JOE:
 <i>Yeah, Lake Mead.</i>

535
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,400
Well, we hope it helps.

536
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Okay, I'm looking forward to it.

537
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,700
Bye.

538
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,600
I take it no one has heard
from Melissa yet?

539
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Not yet.

540
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,000
They're going to call the
Lake Mead Tourist Board

541
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,300
first thing in
the morning.

542
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,600
See if they know of any
locals named Chuck

543
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,100
who have cabins for rent.

544
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,200
It would be
completely wrong

545
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,700
during ts
periodcrisis

546
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,800
to wonder when...

547
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,800
and if he's ever going
to offer you that job,

548
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,000
wouldn't it?
Yes.

549
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,600
It would be
completely wrong.

550
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,700
But I can't help but
wonder either.

551
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,700
Is there some
particular reason

552
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,500
you don't want to take
this to the Barristers?

553
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,800
Allison, this is not an
easy call to make.

554
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
"Hey, sorry to wake you up

555
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,600
"in the middle of the night,
Peter,

556
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,100
"but my wife
thinks your daughter

557
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,100
is in the clutches
of some maniac."

558
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,500
You don't get
to pick and choose

559
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,000
Hey...
which dreams you want
to believe in.

560
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,700
Listen, I'm not asking
to pick and choose.

561
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,800
I'm just saying that

562
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
if we're going to deliver
this horrific news,

563
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,700
can we at least serve it up
with a side order of hope?

564
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,300
Just tell me that
you saw the,

565
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,600
the make and model
of the car

566
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,900
or the license plate.

567
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,200
That you have some clue as
to where all this happened.

568
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,900
This was just supposed to be
so simple.

569
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,600
Dream the dream.

570
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,900
Find the girl.

571
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,000
Get the job.

572
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,900
Do we have to wake them up
in the middle of the night?

573
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,400
Do you think it'll hold
till morning?

574
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,400
It's like you said...

575
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,300
I don't have any clues,
just bad news.

576
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,900
Yeah, I think
it'll hold till morning.

577
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,200
The trunk of someone's car?

578
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,000
Allison, um...

579
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,400
our daughter left us a message.

580
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,000
She needed time to think.

581
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,200
She wasn't abducted.

582
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,600
She wasn't kidnapped.

583
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,700
Yes, we asked you to
help us find her

584
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,900
but, uh...

585
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,700
I don't think what you're saying
makes much sense.

586
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,400
I know how strange
this sounds.

587
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,200
The dream was very clear.

588
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,100
Your daughter is
in danger.

589
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,300
I think you need
to call the police.

590
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,000
I think you need to file
a missing persons report.

591
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,100
I think you need
to launch a search for her.

592
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,800
We launch this search
on the basis of nothing other

593
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,900
than this woman's dreams
and it turns out she's fine?

594
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,900
Turns out she's
doing exactly

595
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,300
what she said she
was going to do?

596
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
Thinking?

597
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,200
She's going to be furious
with us.

598
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,600
Peter, this woman is
trying to help us.

599
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,500
She's trying
to warn us.

600
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,000
She was right
about Lake Mead.

601
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,000
I was?

602
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Partially.

603
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,700
We called there first thing
this morning.

604
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,000
There is a cabin owner
named Chuck.

605
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,200
I don't remember his last name.

606
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,200
He knew exactly
who Melissa was.

607
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,200
He rented a place to her
several times before.

608
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,900
But he hasn't heard from her
in years.

609
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,700
And she certainly
isn't up there now.

610
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,500
Fine, Peter. You win.

611
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,900
She's only half right.
Look,

612
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,700
all I'm saying is we have three
different private investigators

613
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,700
out there looking for her.

614
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Why don't
we take a step back.

615
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,700
You take a step back.

616
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,800
Someone I trust is telling me

617
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,800
my daughter is being
held against her will.

618
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,800
I know what I
have to do.

619
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,200
I'm calling
the police.

620
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,700
PETER:
She's changed a lot

621
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,900
since that
time but...

622
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,600
Peter does not look happy.

623
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,300
What other choice
do we have, Joe?

624
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,200
Well, how seriously are the
police going to take all this

625
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,100
once they hear
that you're involved?

626
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,100
No one's going to mention me.

627
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,200
Oh, excuse me.

628
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,400
Steven, hi.

629
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,300
Uh, come in.

630
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,100
Come, come in.

631
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,500
My plane got in
a little early.

632
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,500
My favorite
son-in-law to be.

633
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
I'm glad you're here.

634
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,800
What...

635
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,900
What is all this?

636
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,900
Steven...

637
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,600
I can't give you
specifics just now,

638
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,800
but suffice it to say that
we have reason to believe

639
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,600
that someone may be holding
Melissa somewhere

640
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,700
against her will.

641
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,300
You're kidding me,
right?

642
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,900
But that's not possible.

643
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,000
I don't want to believe
it either...

644
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,100
No. You don't understand.

645
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,900
It's actually not possible.

646
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,000
She just left me a message
an hour ago.

647
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,900
(on voicemail):
Hey. It's me.

648
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,400
I know I'm being a coward,
leaving a message, but...

649
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,900
I just didn't think
I could handle talking to you.

650
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,900
Not yet.

651
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,800
I'm not going to tell you
where I am,

652
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,900
but I wanted you to know
that I was safe.

653
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,100
That I'm thinking about you.

654
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,800
About us.

655
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,800
I just need little more time
to figure it all out.

656
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,000
When I do, I'll be in touch.

657
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,700
I promise.
BONNIE:
Oh...

658
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,800
I turned my phone back on
when the plane landed,

659
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,100
there it was.

660
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
She knew I was flying back
from L.A. today.

661
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,200
I figured she did it
on purpose.

662
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,900
Called my cell when
she knew it'd be off,

663
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,900
so she could
avoid speaking to me.

664
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,000
Oh, thank God
she's okay.

665
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,300
Thank God.

666
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,500
I'd, uh...

667
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,000
I'd better explain
to the detectives

668
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,000
why we won't be needing
their assistance after all.

669
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
As for the two of you,

670
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,400
I suggest you slip out
of here quietly,

671
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,700
before I ask these police
officers to find something

672
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,200
to charge you with.

673
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,200
Hey.

674
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,200
???

675
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Kids down?

676
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,600
Yep.

677
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,900
And out.

678
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,200
All except Ariel.

679
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,100
What you doing?

680
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,100
What you doing?

681
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,200
I'm looking for a job.

682
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
How's it going?

683
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,900
Well, that depends.

684
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,300
How you feel
about Oregon?

685
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,700
I'm so sorry.

686
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,800
I know how badly
you wanted that job.

687
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,400
I know how badly we needed
that job.

688
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,400
I just...

689
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,400
(sighs):
I don't know.

690
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,100
(sighs):
Okay.

691
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,400
Guess I'll go to bed.

692
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Co here.

693
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,800
REPORTER:
A federal jury in Chicago
found reputed Mob boss

694
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,700
Joseph Binale Nardiello

695
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,700
guilty on all charges today

696
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,300
after a five-month trial
in federal court.

697
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,700
A racketeering conspiracy charge
included in the indictment

698
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,000
carries a maximum sentence
of 20 years in federal prison.

699
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,900
Sentencing will be set
on February 28.

700
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,200
You ?

701
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,900
See? Someone had
a day worse than ours.

702
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,500
(on TV):
And...

703
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,500

00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,200
(remote clicks):
Big news out of Chicago today

705
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,100
as Joseph Binale Nardiello
was found guilty

706
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,000
on all charges,
after a five-month trial.

707
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
You okay?

708
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
Everything all right?

709
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Yeah.

710
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,500
I think so.

711
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,700
You remember
when I told you

712
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,500
that Melissa would never
have gone back to Paris

713
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,100
to figure out whether or not
she wanted to marry Steven?

714
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,300
I think I must
have been wrong.

715
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,100
Oh, Mr. Henley.

716
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,500
Ah, thank goodness.

717
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,800
I was afraid
I might've missed you.

718
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,700
You have so many buildings here,

719
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,100
I wasn't sure
this was the right one.

720
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,000
Mrs. Dubois,
did you call?

721
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,900
Was somebody
in my organization

722
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,700
supposed to let me know
that you wanted to see me?

723
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,400
No, it all happened
spontaneously.

724
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,500
You said that you
had read about me.

725
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,400
Yeah.

726
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,600
I had a dream
last night...

727
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,700
a dream about Melissa,
about where she may be.

728
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,800
I know this sounds crazy,

729
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,700
but I think that
she may be in Paris.

730
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,900
I think she may be
in the hotel

731
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,700
that the two of you
honeymooned in.

732
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,400
What?!

733
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,900
It doesn't make a lot
of sense to me either,

734
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,100
but there you go.

735
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,600
Anyway, I spent
most of my day

736
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,800
trying to figure out
which hotel in Paris.

737
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,300
And it's a long story,

738
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,600
but I can't really ask
Bonnie and Peter.

739
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,300
And then I realized...

740
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,600
I could ask you.

741
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,100
I know it
sounds crazy.

742
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,000
Let me get this straight--

743
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
you... you saw Melissa...

744
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,500
in the same hotel that
she and I honeymooned in...

745
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,200
in a dream?

746
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,100
Okay, um...

747
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,500
Residence de Bastille.

748
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,100
???

749
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,700
Yeah.

750
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,300
But I'm afraid you're
not gonna find her there.

751
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,800
Why do you say that?

752
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,000
It was torn down in 2003.

753
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,900
No, are you sure?

754
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,200
Positive. I tried to book
a room there last year.

755
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,200
Look...

756
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,600
I don't mean to tell you
your business, but...

757
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,300
it sounds to me like...

758
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,100
your dream was just a dream.

759
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
You okay?

760
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,300
Yes. I'm fine.

761
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,100
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

762
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,800
WOMAN:
Phoenix Police Department,
may I help you?

763
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
(hushed):
What are you doing here?

764
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,200
Do you have any
idea how much trouble

765
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,900
I'll be in if
anybody saw you?

766
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,100
What if Van Dyke
walked in?

767
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,000
Wait a second.
I'm confused.

768
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,600
How could anything
you've seen

769
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,800
possibly have
happened in the present,

770
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,400
in Paris, no less,

771
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,300
if that hotel room
doesn't exist anymore?

772
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,400
I think he built it.

773
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,700
The hotel room--
I think he built it.

774
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,500
He recreated it
down to the titiniest detail.

775
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,500
I think he even
duplicated the view.

776
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,800
You're serious?

777
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,100
Look, I know how it sounds.

778
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,300
I tossed and turned
about this all last night.

779
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,700
But this is what this guy does.

780
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,200
He builds dioramas.

781
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,100
He builds environments.

782
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,400
So you're saying you think
that Melissa Barrister

783
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,400
is being held captive
in some fake Paris hotel room

784
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,200
that this guy built
over there at his business?

785
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,000
But why?

786
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,500
I don't know.

787
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,500
She's about to marry again.

788
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,700
Maybe the idea
of losing her forever...

789
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,000
I think he thought
he could win her back.

790
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,300
All right, look,
even if I could

791
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,600
wrap my mind around
the idea of this lovesick guy

792
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,300
building an elaborate
stage set

793
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,700
to woo his ex-wife...

794
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,300
...there's no way
I can get a warrant

795
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,300
to search that complex
on the basis of a dream.

796
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,300
It's not gonna happen.

797
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,500
I know that.

798
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,300
I'm just worried.

799
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,300
He knows who I am.

800
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,100
He knows I'm looking.

801
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,200
He knows I know
about that hotel room.

802
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,500
I think I may have
rattled his cage.

803
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,300
I am concerned
about what he may do to her.

804
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,800
No, no, no, I hear that.

805
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,600
But I still can't
 <i>legally</i> go in there.

806
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,300
I mean, it's not like somebody
called in a fire alarm

807
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,200
or a chemical spill
or a bomb threat.

808
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,200
What are you saying?

809
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,600
I mean, I'm going to be in that
area around 10:30 this morning.

810
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,300
About an hour
and fifteen from now.

811
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,800
And you know,
if somebody did call in,

812
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,300
like a fire or a bomb threat,
something like that,

813
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,300
then being in the area,
I'd actually be legally obliged

814
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,700
to assist the emergency crews--

815
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,100
walk through every building,
each and every room

816
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,200
in that complex to make sure
that everyone was evacuated.

817
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,800
But failing that...

818
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Oh...

819
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,900
In any case, I'm sorry
I couldn't have been more help.

820
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,000
Somebody please
let me out of here!

821
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,000
Please let me out!

822
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,100
Please!

823
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,900
Somebody, please!

824
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,000
Somebody...
(door opening)

825
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,000
NEWSCASTER:
Melissa Barrister was released

826
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,400
from Casa Valley Memorial
Hospital this morning

827
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,900
where she was held for 24-hour
observation after spending

828
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:08,200
four nights a captive of her
ex-husband, Kent Henley.

829
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,600
Mr. Henley, who abducted
his former wife at gunpoint,

830
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,100
went to great lengths
to give her family

831
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
the impression
that she had run away,

832
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,400
even going so far as to force
Ms. Barrister to leave a message

833
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,200
on her fiance's cell phone
that indicated she was

834
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,000
safe and would come home soon.

835
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,300
In other news...

836
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,700
BRIDGETTE:
This is so not fair.

837
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,900
They didn't even mention
how Mommy helped.

838
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,600
Here, hon.

839
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,700
Well, it's okay, honey.

840
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,200
Mommy's had more than enough
attention the last few months.

841
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,100
Mr. Barrister knows,
though, right?

842
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,900
Now he'll give you the job?

843
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,700
Uh, well, he would
give Daddy the job,

844
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,700
except he doesn't own
the company anymore.

845
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,800
He called us last night
to let us know

846
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,100
that he was selling it.

847
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,300
He wanted to stay home
with his daughter,

848
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,100
help her get better after
everything she'd been through.

849
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,700
Okay, but doesn't
the new owner

850
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,200
still need an engineer?

851
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,800
Uh... I'm pretty sure
that Aerodytech

852
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,600
has all the engineers
they can handle.

853
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,800
Aerodytech?

854
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,800
Your old company
is the new owner?

855
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,000
Mm-hmm.

856
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,900
That's so not fair.

857
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,100
What are you doing?

858
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,100
Still looking for a job.

859
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,600
Any luck?

860
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,200
Um, that depends.

861
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,200
How do you feel about Oregon?

862
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,000
You mean building it
or actually living there?

863
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,500
Come here.

864
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,900
???

865
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,300
??

866
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,000
???

867
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
??
