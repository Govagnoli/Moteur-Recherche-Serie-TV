1
00:00:03,415 --> 00:00:04,590
Excuse me!

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,616
I need help!

3
00:00:07,357 --> 00:00:08,582
Can you help me?

4
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:11,276
I need money and I'm running out of time!

5
00:00:13,287 --> 00:00:14,772
Hey! Hey, this is important!

6
00:00:14,823 --> 00:00:15,818
Can you help me?

7
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:17,267
I need money!

8
00:00:21,446 --> 00:00:24,486
You, you! I'm talking to you!
I need money!

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,125
Allison!

10
00:00:27,357 --> 00:00:28,470
Hey, hey, hey!

11
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:29,877
Help me!

12
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:31,489
I need money!

13
00:00:32,315 --> 00:00:34,533
Give me money!
Give me money!

14
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,530
Hey! Hey!

15
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:39,083
- Allison!
- This is important!

16
00:00:39,864 --> 00:00:43,933
I need help! Can you help me?
I need money! I'm running out of time!

17
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,605
This is important!

18
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:50,358
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I can't talk now!

19
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:51,784
I need money!

20
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:53,802
I need money!

21
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,098
How would you normally describe your quality of sleep?

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,722
I mean, would you say your sleep is normally uneventful?

23
00:01:55,256 --> 00:01:58,395
Do you sleep through the night,
wake up rested, that sort of thing?

24
00:01:58,446 --> 00:02:02,022
Or are you one of those people
who wake up several times a night,

25
00:02:02,073 --> 00:02:03,200
tired, moody?

26
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:05,511
Pretty normal.

27
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:10,651
I suppose, yeah.
Pretty normal...

28
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,554
kinda.

29
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:16,187
And you don't remember how you got to the highway,

30
00:02:16,238 --> 00:02:18,289
why you were on the highway,
anything about the highway?

31
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,965
All I remember is my husband
slapping me awake.

32
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,428
I'll be right back.

33
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:31,713
Look at it from my side...

34
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:33,760
- Your side?! You keep acting as if...
- ...spoken to in three years

35
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:35,508
- ...I've done something to you.
- is calling me to tell me...

36
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:36,648
This has been done to me!

37
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:38,513
...standing in the middle of a highway, half-naked!

38
00:02:38,564 --> 00:02:39,627
...no control over what happened tonight.

39
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:40,743
I roll over, you're not there.

40
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,386
...last thing I remember,
we were getting to bed.

41
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:44,552
...wake up our 12-year-old daughter,
tell her, don't be scared,

42
00:02:44,603 --> 00:02:46,837
but for the next three hours,
you're going to be the oldest person in the house.

43
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:48,921
Stop punishing me as if I've done something wrong!

44
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:51,160
You scared the piss out of me, Allison!

45
00:02:54,513 --> 00:02:55,361
Okay...

46
00:02:55,953 --> 00:02:57,950
I'm pretty sure this will do the trick.

47
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:00,837
Let's take these for the next week or two, just before bed.

48
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:01,818
What are these?

49
00:03:01,911 --> 00:03:03,705
It's an anti-anxiety medication.

50
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:08,127
It's okay; all your neighbors are taking it.

51
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:10,410
That's what I thought this was.

52
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:14,758
Look, we don't really understand what causes sleepwalking in adults,

53
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:16,847
but there are usually two contributing factors:

54
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:18,516
One, the victim is usually...

55
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:20,292
Uh... the victim?

56
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,211
And that would be me?!

57
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:23,440
Yes, ma'am.

58
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:26,871
The victim is usually wrestling with some kind of unresolved anxiety.

59
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:28,670
Additionally, most sleepwalkers are people

60
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:31,777
whose sleep is being disturbed on a fairly regular basis.

61
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,664
I know you said otherwise,

62
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:37,432
but it's entirely possible that it's happening and you're not even aware of it.

63
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,383
Anyway, these pills should knock you out enough

64
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:42,513
that you should sleep soundly and return to a normal sleep cycle.

65
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:44,366
Forgive me, Doc, but that's it?

66
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:47,279
A handful of Valium and "call me in the morning"?

67
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:50,584
She didn't just sneak out in the backyard to look for the cat.

68
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:52,394
She stood in the middle of a highway

69
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:55,615
and tried to strike up a conversation with oncoming traffic.

70
00:03:56,414 --> 00:03:57,721
What about my anxiety?

71
00:03:58,157 --> 00:03:59,733
Do you have any suggestions?

72
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,708
I suggest you lock all the doors and windows at night.

73
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:08,555
Here; feel free to call me if you need anything else.

74
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:12,384
"Nan has a new hat.

75
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:15,607
"Nan's hat is made of wool.

76
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:20,722
- "Nan's wool hat is red."
- Perfect!

77
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:22,366
Yay! Bravo!

78
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:23,908
Great.
Can I talk now?

79
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,767
Want to hear me spell Nan?

80
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:28,467
- I think Ariel is trying to...
- N-A-N. Nan.

81
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,387
Mom...

82
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:30,735
Hey, Bridgette...

83
00:04:31,427 --> 00:04:34,142
Yes, you can talk.
Anyone can talk whenever they want to.

84
00:04:34,193 --> 00:04:37,012
It just... it isn't polite
to talk when someone is reading.

85
00:04:37,063 --> 00:04:38,080
Ooh-yah.

86
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,044
I want to walk home from school.

87
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:45,770
Well, why would you want to do that?

88
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:46,650
Why wouldn't I?

89
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:48,550
We live seven blocks from school.

90
00:04:48,862 --> 00:04:52,573
Besides, Hannah walks home from school every day, and I could walk with her.

91
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:54,167
Wow, I don't know.

92
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,082
Walk home from school?

93
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:57,675
People still do that?

94
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,771
You can't do that!
I need you in the car with me.

95
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:02,238
I'm in the sixth grade.

96
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:04,099
I'm not a baby.

97
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:08,571
I'm old enough to stay home at 2:00 in the morning,
while you guys had your emergency.

98
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:09,775
What emergency?

99
00:05:09,863 --> 00:05:12,352
I want to walk home from school. I do.

100
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:17,931
She wants to walk home from school with her friend.

101
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:20,099
Do you know what I do all day?

102
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:22,457
Do you know what goes through my mind all day?

103
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:24,581
What comes across my desk all day?

104
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:26,596
Of course I do, but she's 12.

105
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:28,797
This is non-negotiable. No!

106
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:31,533
All right, you think so?
Let me tell you how this goes:

107
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:33,374
You say it's non-negotiable, and then, one day,

108
00:05:33,425 --> 00:05:36,076
you're going to drive to school to pick her up and she's not going to be there.

109
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:40,065
Because that's the way kids negotiate when they're told something is non-negotiable.

110
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:41,179
What is the big deal?

111
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,903
Why does she have to walk home?

112
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:45,394
What is she going to do walking home from school with her friend,

113
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,065
that she can't do in the car with me?

114
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:49,065
Use bad language, talk about boys,

115
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,674
complain about her teachers, complain about us...

116
00:05:54,323 --> 00:05:56,251
Allison, look,
she's a good girl.

117
00:05:56,547 --> 00:05:58,471
All right? We live in a nice part of town.

118
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:00,374
I don't think we have a choice.

119
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,497
Bye, Mommy!

120
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:11,079
Bye, lamb chop.

121
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:12,513
Whoa...

122
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:14,996
One more time.

123
00:06:16,453 --> 00:06:18,033
Do you ever walk home alone?

124
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:19,492
I never walk home alone.

125
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,278
And what if Hannah's staying late?

126
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:23,746
I come out here and I ride home with you.

127
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:25,632
Okay, and if Hannah's sick?

128
00:06:25,683 --> 00:06:27,829
I come out here and I ride home with you.

129
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,874
And if you and Hannah have a fight?

130
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:32,166
I come out here and I ride home with you.

131
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:33,366
What's the number of the police?

132
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:34,378
911.

133
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:35,115
What's our phone number?

134
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,501
Mom, I'm 12!

135
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,182
Okay, fine.

136
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:40,555
- Do you have your key?
- I have my key.

137
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:43,430
Now give me a hug.

138
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:49,000
Mom?

139
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:50,939
People can see.

140
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:52,839
Okay.

141
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:01,532
Okay, 4:00!

142
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:03,833
Or earlier, if you want.

143
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:10,881
I want to know where my little boy is.

144
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:14,704
I assure you, Mrs. Church, Ms. Ballou,

145
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:16,662
we're doing all we can to get to the bottom of this.

146
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:18,423
Have you interviewed my ex-husband?

147
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:20,786
Not personally, no, but I believe you know Mr. Calley.

148
00:07:20,837 --> 00:07:22,415
He's head of security operations.

149
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:23,790
Security operations?!

150
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,399
I always thought that he was in charge of making sure

151
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,274
the women arriving didn't run into the women leaving.

152
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:30,179
Ms. Ballou...

153
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:32,271
Do you even know where he is?

154
00:07:33,944 --> 00:07:34,832
Of course not.

155
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,618
He's gone.

156
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:39,817
They're both gone.

157
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:43,611
He took Justin to some safe haven island that he owns in the Caribbean,

158
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:45,816
and I'm never going to see him again.

159
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,916
Ms. Ballou...

160
00:07:47,138 --> 00:07:48,548
your ex-husband, Greydon Church,

161
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,617
is one of the four or five richest men in the country.

162
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,693
I, for one, find it hard to believe he's going to turn his back on that.

163
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:56,120
Oh, he's not turning his back on anything.

164
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:58,183
He's just simply moving it offshore.

165
00:07:58,863 --> 00:08:02,443
I don't think that you understand the depth of his hatred for me.

166
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,773
When you can have anything that you want,

167
00:08:04,824 --> 00:08:07,054
when you can buy anything that you want,

168
00:08:07,482 --> 00:08:10,818
and one thing slips away, refuses to be bought?

169
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,546
Well, what's the point of having all the money in the world,

170
00:08:13,597 --> 00:08:16,028
if you can't use it to exact revenge?

171
00:08:16,198 --> 00:08:18,376
I'm sorry there's acrimony between you and your ex,

172
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:20,874
but his extraordinary wealth does not make him immune

173
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:23,392
with regards to the custody laws of this state.

174
00:08:23,443 --> 00:08:25,798
If he's kept your son beyond his allowed visitation,

175
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:27,579
or transported him out of state,

176
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,929
he will be found, he will be caught, and he will be punished.

177
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,796
Really.

178
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:36,514
And his good friends, the mayor and the governor, will allow that to happen?

179
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:39,373
The mayor values his friends, but not above the law.

180
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:41,008
Ms. Ballou, let's be frank:

181
00:08:41,227 --> 00:08:43,934
Your divorce from Mr. Church hardly left you a pauper.

182
00:08:43,985 --> 00:08:45,812
And, clearly, you have your own friends in high places,

183
00:08:45,863 --> 00:08:48,043
otherwise, you wouldn't be sitting here.

184
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:50,875
Technically, your son's gone missing for barely 12 hours

185
00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:54,531
and it's entirely possible there's a plausible explanation for where he is.

186
00:08:54,582 --> 00:08:55,935
Let us do our work:

187
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:58,366
Begin our investigation and get back to you.

188
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:01,392
Did I mention that one of my good friends from college

189
00:09:01,443 --> 00:09:04,185
is a producer for one of the network newsmagazines?

190
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:06,913
You have 48 hours, Mr. District Attorney,

191
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,655
or she is prepared to run with a story about how the State of Arizona

192
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:11,643
and the City of Phoenix are providing cover

193
00:09:11,694 --> 00:09:14,320
for a billionaire who has kidnapped his own son.

194
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:23,681
Mr. Calley...

195
00:09:24,386 --> 00:09:26,205
I need some answers and I need them quickly.

196
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:28,570
Do you know where little Justin Church is?

197
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:34,157
Well, can you at least tell me where Greydon Church is?

198
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:38,422
Well, first and foremost, let me assure you that everything and everyone are fine.

199
00:09:38,473 --> 00:09:39,990
Oh, you know that?

200
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:42,660
Yes, I do know that,
Mr. District Attorney.

201
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:47,335
Prior to working for Mr. Church, I served Her Majesty for 11 years with MI-6.

202
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:48,984
I know a good many things.

203
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:53,883
You work for the police department, and you are with the Mayor's Office.

204
00:09:54,756 --> 00:09:56,423
And you are...

205
00:09:56,474 --> 00:09:59,208
Allison Dubois, with the District Attorney's Office.

206
00:10:04,876 --> 00:10:07,524
It's 7:00 p.m.
and the Big Dog is not here.

207
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:12,817
Big Do g is not anywhere,and the Range Rover is missing.

208
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:20,840
Mr. District Attorney, we know that the child spent the weekend with his father.

209
00:10:20,891 --> 00:10:24,442
We know that, at approximately 1900 hours yesterday, they left the premises.

210
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:25,992
Do we know where they are? No.

211
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,076
Do we know what time they'll be returning...?

212
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,674
Am I worried? No.

213
00:10:30,285 --> 00:10:34,251
The fact is, Mr. Church often slips away unaccompanied

214
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,602
to do things that men of great wealth like to do anonymously,

215
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:37,834
and without an entourage.

216
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:39,695
He's with a four-year-old boy.

217
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:42,569
Well, perhaps he took him camping or fishing.

218
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:44,590
Do you have a way of getting in touch with him?

219
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:45,633
Does he phone in?

220
00:10:45,684 --> 00:10:47,587
Oh, I'm sure I'll be hearing from him soon enough.

221
00:10:47,638 --> 00:10:48,509
Well, just so we're clear,

222
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,398
if I don't have answers by 3:00 p.m., I'm putting out a warrant.

223
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:53,025
Then answers you shall have.

224
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,746
Fat cat politicalcontributors and their domestic disputes...

225
00:11:00,402 --> 00:11:02,280
10:30, we've accomplished nothing.

226
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:06,157
Mark my words: By 1:00, Junior will be home, Mommy will be drunk,

227
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,676
and Daddy will have made another million.

228
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:09,068
I'm not so sure.

229
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,183
What do you mean?

230
00:11:10,715 --> 00:11:11,462
I just...

231
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,983
When I shook his hand just now,

232
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:18,858
I saw the moment that he realized
that Church was missing. He seemed...

233
00:11:19,332 --> 00:11:20,740
I don't know, concerned.

234
00:11:20,926 --> 00:11:24,464
He didn't seem casual or nonchalant the way he was a moment ago.

235
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,821
He seemed... I don't know...

236
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,654
he was anxious.

237
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:29,978
And that proves...?

238
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:31,605
Nothing. I don't know.

239
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:34,133
I just thought it was curious, that's all.

240
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:37,055
Sorry. I didn't mean to snap.

241
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:43,379
Pardon me for saying so, but you look like hell.

242
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:45,446
Oh, no, I'm fine.

243
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,412
I just... I didn't get any sleep last night.

244
00:11:47,463 --> 00:11:50,630
Okay, well, go on, get out of here.
I'll give you a call.

245
00:11:50,681 --> 00:11:53,496
Trust me, what you just witnessed: a non-event.

246
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:00,946
Hi, Mommy.

247
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:03,081
Hi, lambchop. Buckle up.

248
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:06,697
That's everybody, I guess.

249
00:12:06,748 --> 00:12:07,861
So, how was your day, pumpkin?

250
00:12:07,912 --> 00:12:10,016
It was pretty good.
We played a lot.

251
00:12:10,192 --> 00:12:10,978
Uh-huh.

252
00:12:11,473 --> 00:12:13,057
So how was your day, Mommy?

253
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,768
It was pretty good... I guess.

254
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,351
- Root beer?
- Yeah.

255
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:34,301
Thanks.

256
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:55,067
I think he's a high school boy.

257
00:12:56,092 --> 00:12:57,374
Am I cutting in line?

258
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,481
Can I get two instant picks?

259
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,328
Four dollars.

260
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,075
11, 16...

261
00:13:07,582 --> 00:13:09,333
23, 87...

262
00:13:09,384 --> 00:13:10,150
He's so cute.

263
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:10,889
Eleven.

264
00:13:13,437 --> 00:13:14,429
Nothing.

265
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:17,356
Okay, let's try again.

266
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:22,029
44... 15...

267
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:24,391
22, 23...

268
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:25,325
19.

269
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:27,907
Sorry.

270
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:31,182
77.

271
00:13:33,006 --> 00:13:33,734
Nothing.

272
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,546
Should've went with 19.

273
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,454
- You spoke to him.
- I know!

274
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:55,334
After this, you want to read Nan?

275
00:13:56,938 --> 00:13:57,931
Maybe.

276
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:03,734
Okay, where are you?

277
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:05,899
I'm in my office. Is that okay?

278
00:14:06,456 --> 00:14:08,854
Sorry, sir, I thought you were someone else.

279
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,589
So I'm not in trouble?

280
00:14:10,873 --> 00:14:12,173
No, of course not.

281
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,840
Well, I just wanted to let you know that

282
00:14:13,891 --> 00:14:17,000
I've yet to hear anything more from Mr. Calley or Mr. Church,

283
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:21,395
and I'm starting to grow genuinely concerned about the welfare of this little boy.

284
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:25,787
I don't think I have a choice but to issue a warrant and put out an Amber alert.

285
00:14:25,838 --> 00:14:26,953
Anything I can do?

286
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,266
Not right now. Just...

287
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,610
get some rest and check in with me in the morning.

288
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:34,321
Okay.

289
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:40,723
Huh, look at that.

290
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:43,281
Pizza.

291
00:14:45,356 --> 00:14:46,298
- Hi.
- Hey.

292
00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:48,310
- What's the damage?
- $22.11.

293
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:52,252
Hey, Al, do you have any change?!

294
00:14:52,303 --> 00:14:53,367
Look in my purse!

295
00:14:56,724 --> 00:14:58,098
Hey, I'll be right in.

296
00:15:00,986 --> 00:15:03,124
Everything okay?
Didn't I have change?

297
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,911
Yeah, you had change.

298
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,328
What's going on?

299
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:15,450
Oh, my God!

300
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:18,247
Where'd all this money come from?

301
00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:22,650
According to this, you went to our bank today at 1:57, you closed down two CDs,

302
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:25,772
our IRA and part of our Christmas club, and in return,

303
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:29,116
they gave you $15,000 in cash.

304
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:30,330
That's crazy!

305
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,816
Isn't that your signature?

306
00:15:31,867 --> 00:15:33,985
I swear, I haven't been to the bank in two weeks.

307
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:37,400
Well, you were there today, and you obviously authorized this withdrawal.

308
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:38,113
No!

309
00:15:38,924 --> 00:15:41,360
I dropped the girls off at school, I went to work,

310
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:43,243
I went to pick up Marie and Bridgette. No.

311
00:15:43,294 --> 00:15:44,579
Where did you go for lunch?

312
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,500
I didn't go to lunch.

313
00:15:45,551 --> 00:15:47,633
Devalos sent me home early.
He said I looked tired.

314
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:48,751
He said I looked like hell.

315
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:49,690
When was that?

316
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:51,261
10:30 or...

317
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,194
Wait, wait, wait.

318
00:15:53,718 --> 00:15:54,348
I don't get it.

319
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,458
What did you do between 10:30 in the morning and picking up the girls from school?

320
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:03,577
I don't know.

321
00:16:08,452 --> 00:16:10,417
I-I think maybe I was asleep.

322
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:30,760
I think we need to talk about the driving now.

323
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:32,056
Excuse me?

324
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:33,069
Driving.

325
00:16:33,371 --> 00:16:36,977
Apparently you drove all over town today while you were fast asleep.

326
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:39,138
I think that merits some discussion.

327
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,358
Well, what would you like me to say?

328
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:43,983
How about, "Holy crap, Joe. I could have died."

329
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:46,816
Our children could have died.

330
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:50,110
You could have killed a lot of other innocent people.

331
00:16:50,161 --> 00:16:52,083
We could start there, you could work your way up to "I'm sorry."

332
00:16:52,134 --> 00:16:53,317
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

333
00:16:53,368 --> 00:16:57,666
I thought I was supposed to play the role of victim in this evening's performance.

334
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,519
I'm glad you find this amusing.

335
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,325
Did you take one of those pills?

336
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:05,738
Not yet.

337
00:17:06,854 --> 00:17:08,002
What are you doing?

338
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:10,024
I don't know, making sure this thing is locked.

339
00:17:10,075 --> 00:17:13,353
Trying to figure out a way to keep you and us safe tonight.

340
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,913
You know, I'm pretty sure if I can figure out how to drive a car while I'm asleep,

341
00:17:17,964 --> 00:17:21,112
I'm sure I can figure out how to unlock a door or open a window.

342
00:17:21,163 --> 00:17:22,262
Okay, fine.

343
00:17:23,314 --> 00:17:24,504
What do you suggest?

344
00:17:25,496 --> 00:17:27,172
Should I tie you to the bed?

345
00:17:27,734 --> 00:17:28,966
That sounds like fun.

346
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:30,873
Well, it's not!

347
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:32,824
None of this is fun!

348
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:34,753
Now take your pill!

349
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,457
Fine.

350
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:42,589
I'll take my pill.

351
00:17:43,091 --> 00:17:44,007
Thank you.

352
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:01,479
Wait a second.

353
00:18:03,008 --> 00:18:04,432
Where...? What happened to the money?

354
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,203
I have it.

355
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:08,632
It's somewhere safe.
I have it.

356
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:11,470
I'll take it to the bank in the morning.

357
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:13,927
I don't understand.
Why would you do that?

358
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:18,241
What is it that you're worried that I would do with it?

359
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,188
I don't know.

360
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:21,170
I've never been here before.

361
00:18:21,677 --> 00:18:22,711
Have you?

362
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:33,086
You took... you took my keys, didn't you?
You took my house keys and my car keys?

363
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:34,769
Come on.

364
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:37,122
Let's get ready for bed.

365
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:06,135
Al?

366
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:08,911
Did you hear that?

367
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,006
Al?

368
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:20,111
Daddy?

369
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,169
It's okay.
Go back to bed.

370
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:26,702
Where's the money?!

371
00:19:27,098 --> 00:19:28,203
Where's the money?!

372
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:29,813
I need the money!

373
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,266
I need the money!

374
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:40,934
We got money.

375
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,438
- I need that money!
- Of course you do.

376
00:19:45,832 --> 00:19:47,122
I'll take you to it.

377
00:19:50,685 --> 00:19:52,556
Come on. Come on.

378
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,034
Go to bed.

379
00:19:59,876 --> 00:20:00,660
Bed!

380
00:20:03,973 --> 00:20:05,171
It's right in here.

381
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,944
Where? Where's the money?

382
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:14,235
It's right in there.

383
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,363
Where's the money?

384
00:20:17,544 --> 00:20:18,692
Where's the money?!

385
00:20:23,918 --> 00:20:24,651
Morning.

386
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:26,463
Where is she now?

387
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,248
In bed, awake, thank God.

388
00:20:29,748 --> 00:20:31,048
Well, that won't last.

389
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,479
She's going to fall back asleep eventually,

390
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,706
and when she does, we want to make sure she's really out.

391
00:20:35,757 --> 00:20:38,107
You know where those pills are that I gave her?

392
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:39,618
Yeah, she took one before she went to bed.

393
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:42,125
Well, see if you can get her to take three.

394
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:44,281
Excuse me?

395
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,678
You need some sleep.

396
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:46,675
Give her three.

397
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:49,189
That'll put her out for about 18 hours.

398
00:20:49,358 --> 00:20:50,577
Is that safe?

399
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:54,425
It's absolutely safe, and trust me, she won't be going anywhere on that dosage.

400
00:20:54,476 --> 00:20:56,915
It'll give you and your family some time to recover.

401
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:58,884
Okay. Thank you.

402
00:20:59,152 --> 00:21:00,542
But what about afterwards?

403
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,119
I can't just keep drugging her.

404
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,367
I'm not suggesting that.

405
00:21:03,418 --> 00:21:06,156
What you need to do is observe her, listen to her,

406
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:09,520
figure out what the unresolved anxiety is that's causing her to sleepwalk.

407
00:21:09,571 --> 00:21:11,736
If you can address the root of the anxiety,

408
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:14,353
you can very likely end the disruptive behavior.

409
00:21:21,841 --> 00:21:24,004
Is Mommy picking us up today?

410
00:21:24,155 --> 00:21:25,831
Uh, I don't think so, honey.

411
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:28,806
Um, everyone look for my car when they come out of school, all right?

412
00:21:28,857 --> 00:21:29,764
Not me, Daddy.

413
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:32,826
I'm walking home from school with Hannah, remember?

414
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,236
Right, Hannah.

415
00:21:34,551 --> 00:21:35,268
Got it.

416
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,458
All right, kisses.

417
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:38,243
Kisses.

418
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,943
I'm sorry to bother you.

419
00:21:43,994 --> 00:21:45,536
Um, my name is Joe Dubois.

420
00:21:45,983 --> 00:21:51,182
My wife came in here yesterday and mistakenly withdrew $15,000.

421
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:53,459
Thank you.

422
00:21:55,755 --> 00:21:57,641
I know this sounds kind of crazy,

423
00:21:58,444 --> 00:22:01,764
but I was wondering if there was any way I could just, uh...

424
00:22:01,846 --> 00:22:03,071
give it back.

425
00:22:04,465 --> 00:22:07,926
Uh, it's been barely 18 hours.

426
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:12,131
Well, I don't know what to tell you, Mr. Dubois.

427
00:22:12,412 --> 00:22:14,614
Uh, we're a bank, not a department store.

428
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:16,832
We really don't have a return policy.

429
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:17,842
I know, but...

430
00:22:17,893 --> 00:22:20,265
No, no, no. We can, we can work with you,

431
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:23,975
but those CDs were cashed in early,
and there are penalties for that.

432
00:22:24,026 --> 00:22:26,303
So, the balances won't be the same.

433
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,193
You know, when she came in here,

434
00:22:30,244 --> 00:22:32,804
I sensed there was something strange about it all.

435
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:34,765
The teller brought over her withdrawal slip,

436
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:37,627
and until we convinced her to move the decimal points,

437
00:22:37,678 --> 00:22:39,740
she had it made out for $15 million.

438
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,645
You know, I read somewhere that the governor calls this his idiot tax.

439
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:46,476
Shut up.

440
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,726
43... 76...

441
00:22:51,763 --> 00:22:55,020
nine, 22...

442
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:56,245
Try 16.

443
00:22:56,988 --> 00:22:57,691
What?

444
00:22:58,305 --> 00:22:59,060
I'm lucky.

445
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,235
I have just always been lucky.

446
00:23:01,286 --> 00:23:02,354
Try 16.

447
00:23:05,944 --> 00:23:06,718
29.

448
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:10,951
Guess we know why they call it the idiot tax.

449
00:23:11,002 --> 00:23:11,995
Try again?

450
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,404
53... 99...

451
00:23:16,352 --> 00:23:19,206
61, six...

452
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,047
Five.

453
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:26,568
Hell, five.

454
00:23:28,705 --> 00:23:29,675
Got one right.

455
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:32,181
In fifth position, number five.

456
00:23:32,673 --> 00:23:34,165
You just won five dollars.

457
00:23:43,113 --> 00:23:43,844
Excellent.

458
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:46,255
Excellent, excellent, excellent.

459
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:48,134
See you tomorrow.

460
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:51,797
You are...

461
00:23:51,895 --> 00:23:54,605
You are the luckiest person I have ever met.

462
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,630
What time is it?

463
00:24:13,464 --> 00:24:15,274
Don't you mean what day is it?

464
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:18,356
Oh, my God.
How long have I been asleep?

465
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:21,016
About 16 hours.

466
00:24:22,356 --> 00:24:24,037
It's night.
Oh, my God.

467
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,266
What about the kids?
Where are the kids?

468
00:24:26,317 --> 00:24:27,233
Are the kids in bed?

469
00:24:27,284 --> 00:24:28,384
I'm hoping so.

470
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,759
Ariel's at Hannah's, Bridgette and Marie are at Alan and Kamala's.

471
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:32,741
What? Why?

472
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:35,643
It's a, it's a weeknight.
The girls have school in the morning.

473
00:24:35,694 --> 00:24:39,652
All the more reason *** someplace where they can get a good night's sleep.

474
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:42,930
Oh, Joe.

475
00:24:43,594 --> 00:24:44,608
It's okay.

476
00:24:45,553 --> 00:24:49,162
What about work?
Did anyone call from work? This is terrible.

477
00:24:49,242 --> 00:24:51,273
Devalos, a few hours ago.

478
00:24:51,977 --> 00:24:54,198
He wanted me to tell you that Calley called.

479
00:24:54,249 --> 00:24:57,543
Apparently Greydon Church ran off with $15 million

480
00:24:57,818 --> 00:25:01,711
in cash and bearer bonds the day he and his son disappeared.

481
00:25:02,682 --> 00:25:05,592
Does that number hold any special significance for you?

482
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:07,082
$15 million?

483
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:07,903
Mm-hmm.

484
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,065
No.

485
00:25:09,887 --> 00:25:11,064
Why? Should it?

486
00:25:11,565 --> 00:25:15,809
Apparently you tried to withdraw that same amount from our bank account yesterday.

487
00:25:21,163 --> 00:25:22,486
I don't remember.

488
00:25:22,846 --> 00:25:24,480
I had a hunch you wouldn't.

489
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,572
I am so sorry about all of this.

490
00:25:30,425 --> 00:25:32,193
You look exhausted.

491
00:25:34,722 --> 00:25:35,912
You need some sleep.

492
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:38,096
Maybe you should get me another one of those pills.

493
00:25:38,147 --> 00:25:39,549
No, no more pills.

494
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:44,402
Actually, I thought tonight we'd try something different.

495
00:25:58,998 --> 00:25:59,969
Hey, Al.

496
00:26:00,566 --> 00:26:01,309
Al, you awake?

497
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,260
Shh!

498
00:26:02,383 --> 00:26:04,566
Not now! I gotta get to Route 96.

499
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,679
Route 96?
What's on Route 96?

500
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,551
My car keys!

501
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,122
I can't find my car keys!

502
00:26:15,885 --> 00:26:17,441
I hid them, remember?

503
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,811
You want me to drive you?

504
00:26:21,845 --> 00:26:24,527
This is as far as I know to go.
You can stop.

505
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:26,206
Stop!

506
00:26:37,488 --> 00:26:39,310
I think that's close enough.

507
00:26:39,793 --> 00:26:41,517
I have to get down there!

508
00:26:41,568 --> 00:26:42,412
What's down there?

509
00:26:42,463 --> 00:26:44,376
I have to get down there!

510
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,252
No, I think now would be an excellent time to wake up!

511
00:26:47,303 --> 00:26:49,129
I have to get down there.

512
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,222
Allison, hey, hey! Wake up!

513
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:53,290
Oh, boy.

514
00:26:53,636 --> 00:26:54,471
Sorry!

515
00:26:57,486 --> 00:26:59,028
Just know that I love you.

516
00:27:01,283 --> 00:27:02,422
Allison!

517
00:27:04,433 --> 00:27:05,891
There's a car down here!

518
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:11,294
Oh, boy.

519
00:27:11,845 --> 00:27:14,122
License plate says "Church 1"!

520
00:27:14,618 --> 00:27:15,779
Greydon Church.

521
00:27:20,645 --> 00:27:21,552
Oh, boy.

522
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:24,693
If this is him, he's dead!

523
00:27:26,105 --> 00:27:27,912
Is there a little boy with him?

524
00:27:28,248 --> 00:27:29,100
Hold on!

525
00:27:44,177 --> 00:27:44,909
No!

526
00:27:45,156 --> 00:27:46,408
I don't see anyone!

527
00:28:04,407 --> 00:28:08,274
I think I may have found that $15 million you've been looking for.

528
00:28:17,438 --> 00:28:20,658
Whatever you can't move to this afternoon, move to tomorrow.

529
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:24,773
Tell the rest of the guys I-I'll be in, um, after lunch.

530
00:28:24,824 --> 00:28:27,272
Yeah. We're at the pediatrician's right now.

531
00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:30,423
Okay, thanks.

532
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:32,388
Lonely place to die.

533
00:28:33,557 --> 00:28:36,002
That car could have sat there for months if you didn't find it.

534
00:28:36,053 --> 00:28:38,262
What was he doing out here?
Do you think his ex was right?

535
00:28:38,313 --> 00:28:39,506
Do you think he was trying to run off?

536
00:28:39,557 --> 00:28:41,493
If he was, he was doing it alone.

537
00:28:41,947 --> 00:28:44,112
We've combed through a hundred yards of desert in each direction,

538
00:28:44,163 --> 00:28:47,854
and there's nothing to suggest that a second body was thrown clear of Church's car.

539
00:28:47,905 --> 00:28:50,553
Is there anyway that his son could have walked away?

540
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,739
The passenger door was pinned against the side of the embankment.

541
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,322
No tracks, no blood trail.

542
00:28:55,373 --> 00:28:56,379
Detective Scanlon?

543
00:28:56,437 --> 00:28:58,541
This was found in Church's CD player.

544
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:05,720
Did you enjoy your cigarette, Mr. Church?

545
00:29:05,771 --> 00:29:06,546
I hope so.

546
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:10,603
You have 45 minutes to respond to this message, and your time starts now.

547
00:29:10,654 --> 00:29:12,600
If you ever care to see your son again,

548
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:16,449
gather that $15 million you keep lying around in cash and bearer bonds,

549
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,946
and drive out on the 10.

550
00:29:17,997 --> 00:29:20,418
Exit onto Rural Route 96.

551
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:22,974
There's a gas station just north of Saxonburg.

552
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:24,933
Park and wait for further instruction.

553
00:29:24,984 --> 00:29:26,657
Do not alert your staff.

554
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:28,575
Do not alert the authorities.

555
00:29:28,626 --> 00:29:30,810
You have 45 minutes to appear.

556
00:29:31,012 --> 00:29:32,906
If you do not appear in 45 minutes

557
00:29:32,957 --> 00:29:35,746
I will sever one finger from your son's left hand.

558
00:29:35,797 --> 00:29:39,057
Every ten minutes you keep me waiting, I will remove another finger.

559
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:41,885
When I run out of fingers, I will start on his toes.

560
00:29:41,936 --> 00:29:44,014
You have already lost one minute.

561
00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:51,449
That has to be someone who worked for me, or...

562
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,702
works for me.

563
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:54,863
He knows too much.

564
00:29:54,914 --> 00:29:56,817
The smoking, the apocalypse money...

565
00:29:56,868 --> 00:29:57,919
Apocalypse money?

566
00:29:59,434 --> 00:30:01,116
He always kept it around, kept it close,

567
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:04,605
big duffel full of cash and bonds, for when the apocalypse came.

568
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,419
Or terrorists...

569
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:08,982
I used to kid him about it.

570
00:30:09,622 --> 00:30:11,072
What's the smoking thing?

571
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:16,172
He quit for seven months when Justin was born, but he fell off the wagon.

572
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,849
He was bound and determined that his son never know,

573
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,304
never see him do it, so he used to sneak out.

574
00:30:22,355 --> 00:30:24,803
"Just give me four minutes," he used to say.

575
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:27,726
"Just four minutes." So, uh...

576
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:34,172
whoever it was, knew...

577
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:41,374
knew that he had four minutes in and out, to take the boy...

578
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:49,001
...leave the disc.

579
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,227
All right, we got a little boy to find.

580
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:55,456
You know what you need to do.

581
00:30:55,507 --> 00:30:56,294
Pray?

582
00:30:57,135 --> 00:30:58,677
That CD is three days old.

583
00:30:58,773 --> 00:30:59,768
Nonetheless.

584
00:31:02,056 --> 00:31:03,514
And you and your husbandshould head home.

585
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:05,477
Get some sleep, you've done what you can here.

586
00:31:05,528 --> 00:31:06,461
You sure?

587
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:08,299
Have you looked at yourself?

588
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,418
You're exhausted.

589
00:31:09,982 --> 00:31:12,725
Besides, you're the only person I can honestly say is more effective

590
00:31:12,776 --> 00:31:14,736
when they're asleep than when they're awake.

591
00:31:14,787 --> 00:31:17,435
It's 7:00 p.m., and the Big Dog is not here.

592
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:21,631
The Big Dog is not anywhere and the Range Rover's missing.

593
00:31:24,756 --> 00:31:25,730
Nice to have you back.

594
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:26,665
Sleep well?

595
00:31:27,212 --> 00:31:28,108
I don't know.

596
00:31:28,643 --> 00:31:30,311
I keep seeing the same thing.

597
00:31:30,537 --> 00:31:33,246
When I'm awake, when I dream. It's Calley.

598
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,806
It's that, it's the moment he discovers that Church is missing.

599
00:31:37,006 --> 00:31:39,772
I, I just can't figure out why I keep seeing it.

600
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,208
Great, you're here.

601
00:31:46,382 --> 00:31:47,283
Just one sec.

602
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:00,187
Is this her?

603
00:32:00,271 --> 00:32:01,033
That's her.

604
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:03,033
Oh, my God.
She's just a kid.

605
00:32:03,209 --> 00:32:04,933
Yeah, but watch this.

606
00:32:05,686 --> 00:32:07,474
Give me one $20 instant pick.

607
00:32:07,827 --> 00:32:08,984
$20, huh?

608
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,411
Gonna be a mega-idiot.

609
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:11,252
Shut up.

610
00:32:12,286 --> 00:32:14,214
All right, what's my first number?

611
00:32:18,096 --> 00:32:19,026
This is stupid.

612
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:21,010
Let's just buy some beer.
Forget this.

613
00:32:21,061 --> 00:32:24,179
I know he's over 21,
but I need to see your ID, miss.

614
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:34,230
- What's the matter with you? Give me a number.
- Leave her alone.

615
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:40,615
11.

616
00:32:40,924 --> 00:32:42,726
All right,
she's doing it. 11.

617
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:46,559
23.

618
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:49,075
14.

619
00:32:50,396 --> 00:32:51,302
38.

620
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,828
32.

621
00:32:53,523 --> 00:32:54,411
All right. 11,

622
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:58,580
23, 14, 38, 32.

623
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:02,741
The governor says thanks.

624
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:04,416
Why? How much did I win?

625
00:33:04,865 --> 00:33:06,893
You won me and a six-pack of beer.

626
00:33:08,034 --> 00:33:09,210
Let's go.

627
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,598
Wait a minute.

628
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:13,343
You just lost me 20 bucks, twerp.

629
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,808
What are you blaming her for?

630
00:33:17,882 --> 00:33:19,340
She's just a little kid.

631
00:33:19,524 --> 00:33:21,754
You're the idiot that plays the lottery.

632
00:33:29,386 --> 00:33:31,096
Did Ariel say anything to you?

633
00:33:34,703 --> 00:33:35,846
No. Why?

634
00:33:36,587 --> 00:33:37,264
I don't know.

635
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,495
She just seemed awfully quiet at dinner.

636
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,329
It's starting.

637
00:33:42,752 --> 00:33:43,724
What's starting?

638
00:33:48,197 --> 00:33:50,007
She's living her own life.

639
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:50,873
She's...

640
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,339
making her own memories.

641
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,931
Keeping her own secrets.

642
00:33:56,741 --> 00:33:58,822
She's walking home from school.

643
00:33:59,084 --> 00:34:02,346
She's not backpacking across Europe with some guy named Sven.

644
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:04,249
You joke. I miss her.

645
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,985
She's right next door.

646
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:27,730
Hang on one second.

647
00:34:27,781 --> 00:34:29,745
Someone's at the door. Hey.

648
00:34:48,413 --> 00:34:49,656
Uncle Calley?

649
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:55,596
Allison. Allison. Allison!

650
00:34:57,671 --> 00:34:58,614
Mommy?

651
00:34:58,871 --> 00:35:00,337
What were you doing?

652
00:35:02,658 --> 00:35:03,592
It's okay.

653
00:35:04,177 --> 00:35:05,280
I'm awake now.

654
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:13,089
It's Devalos. He has news.

655
00:35:13,307 --> 00:35:14,894
Calley shot the kidnapper.

656
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:16,223
Justin's safe.

657
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,210
I know. I was there.

658
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,082
I'll get the pills.

659
00:35:23,311 --> 00:35:25,909
It's 7:00 p.m., ananthe Big Dog is not here.

660
00:35:27,007 --> 00:35:30,059
Big Dog is not anywhere, and the Range Rover is missing.

661
00:35:38,777 --> 00:35:40,347
Oh, my God.

662
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:41,846
Not again.

663
00:35:41,897 --> 00:35:43,301
No, no. Shh!
It's okay.

664
00:35:43,352 --> 00:35:44,597
I'm awake, I swear.

665
00:35:44,783 --> 00:35:45,847
Go back to sleep.

666
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:51,291
I couldn't figure out why it kept showing me the same moment over and over again, and then...

667
00:35:51,342 --> 00:35:53,480
Wait. Who kept showing you what moment?

668
00:35:53,556 --> 00:35:58,165
Church. He kept showing me the moment when Calley discovered that he and the boy were gone.

669
00:35:58,216 --> 00:36:00,262
Except Calley never mentioned the boy.

670
00:36:01,123 --> 00:36:01,992
I'm sorry?

671
00:36:02,297 --> 00:36:05,619
It's always "The Big Dog" is gone. The Big Dog. Church.

672
00:36:05,712 --> 00:36:07,398
Not the Big Dog and his son.

673
00:36:08,093 --> 00:36:10,843
It's because Calley already knew the son was gone.

674
00:36:11,121 --> 00:36:15,265
Because Calley and the man he was talking to had already snatched him.

675
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:33,247
I think I speak for everyone when I offer my heartfelt thanks

676
00:36:33,298 --> 00:36:37,106
for your extraordinarily brave rescue of Justin Church early this morning.

677
00:36:37,434 --> 00:36:39,416
Obviously, since a homicide was involved,

678
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:41,753
there are some facts we'll need to sort through.

679
00:36:41,804 --> 00:36:45,382
And, since you've waived your right to have an attorney present,

680
00:36:45,433 --> 00:36:48,653
I promise to make this as quick and as painless as possible.

681
00:36:48,704 --> 00:36:52,178
Can you tell us something about your relationship with the apparent kidnapper--

682
00:36:52,229 --> 00:36:54,392
Mr. Tracy Oppen?

683
00:36:55,037 --> 00:36:58,126
Yes. Mr. Church asked me to let him go last January.

684
00:36:58,177 --> 00:36:58,994
Bad attitude.

685
00:36:59,421 --> 00:37:00,543
They had had words.

686
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:03,985
And I understand he was still carrying copies of keys to the house?

687
00:37:04,036 --> 00:37:06,300
I turned everything over to the detective.

688
00:37:06,352 --> 00:37:08,043
So you went through your records--

689
00:37:08,094 --> 00:37:09,953
everyone who had worked for Mr. Church--

690
00:37:10,004 --> 00:37:13,001
and there was just something about Mr. Oppen?

691
00:37:14,587 --> 00:37:17,245
It was an instinct more than anything, I suppose.

692
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:21,001
I remembered hearing that he lived in the desert,

693
00:37:21,052 --> 00:37:24,532
and then we were in the desert yesterday morning with Mr. Church.

694
00:37:25,288 --> 00:37:26,830
I decided to go out there.

695
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:31,886
Must have heard my truck coming because he was standing outside when I pulled in.

696
00:37:31,937 --> 00:37:32,863
Outside?

697
00:37:33,624 --> 00:37:34,224
Hang on one second.

698
00:37:34,258 --> 00:37:35,297
Someone's at the door.

699
00:37:35,348 --> 00:37:35,948
Really?

700
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,432
The minute he saw me, he turned and ran back inside.

701
00:37:42,904 --> 00:37:45,628
I just knew in my bones he was going for a gun,

702
00:37:46,228 --> 00:37:48,927
so, once he was down, I went inside to look for Justin.

703
00:37:48,978 --> 00:37:51,274
I wasn't sure what I'd find, but he was right there.

704
00:37:51,325 --> 00:37:52,298
Nothing missing.

705
00:37:53,091 --> 00:37:56,672
I picked him up and I took him to hospital as fast as I could.

706
00:37:58,647 --> 00:37:59,963
Simple as that, really.

707
00:38:01,337 --> 00:38:04,613
You're very fond of Justin, aren't you?

708
00:38:04,818 --> 00:38:05,682
Of course.

709
00:38:05,918 --> 00:38:09,540
And I know you would never do anything to cause him any real harm.

710
00:38:09,951 --> 00:38:11,765
And I know you were very fond of his father.

711
00:38:11,816 --> 00:38:13,702
In fact, you were devoted to him.

712
00:38:14,587 --> 00:38:18,125
You had no way of knowing that his car would go over that cliff.

713
00:38:20,058 --> 00:38:21,382
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

714
00:38:21,526 --> 00:38:22,419
I haven't slept.

715
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,354
Uh... I'm not sure I understand where this is going.

716
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:27,947
We were just wondering about the phones.

717
00:38:28,912 --> 00:38:29,847
The phones?

718
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:34,648
We have a witness who says Oppen was on the phone when you shot him.

719
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,284
Well, that's absurd.

720
00:38:37,335 --> 00:38:38,039
I saw no phone.

721
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,488
There certainly were no witnesses.

722
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:44,143
This witness also says you stopped on the way to the hospital and threw something away.

723
00:38:45,528 --> 00:38:48,063
Again, there were no witnesses, there were no phones.

724
00:38:48,114 --> 00:38:52,814
Mr. Calley, this witness led us to the place where he says you deposited this trash.

725
00:38:52,975 --> 00:38:54,201
This is ridiculous.

726
00:38:55,508 --> 00:38:57,302
Inside, two disposable cell phones--

727
00:38:57,353 --> 00:38:59,583
the kind you get at a convenience store.

728
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:01,776
Cheap, hard to trace.

729
00:39:02,443 --> 00:39:05,184
One of them has Mr. Oppen's fingerprints all over it.

730
00:39:05,235 --> 00:39:07,381
You were on the other, talking to him.

731
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:08,777
Hang on one second.

732
00:39:08,828 --> 00:39:10,152
Someone's at the door.

733
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:14,701
You were talking to him because he was your accomplice.

734
00:39:14,902 --> 00:39:16,773
The two of you had a plan, and it would have worked,

735
00:39:16,824 --> 00:39:20,353
if only Mr. Church hadn't been in such a hurry and gone off that road.

736
00:39:20,404 --> 00:39:24,205
And if only our witness hadn't heard Mr. Oppen on the telephone,

737
00:39:24,858 --> 00:39:27,172
and then seen you throw those phones away.

738
00:39:28,948 --> 00:39:30,148
This is absurd.

739
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:31,694
I had no accomplice.

740
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:36,906
I don't know anything about any phones, and I can assure you there is no witness.

741
00:39:37,045 --> 00:39:37,867
Really?

742
00:39:38,406 --> 00:39:40,626
Are you calling Justin Church a liar?

743
00:39:46,907 --> 00:39:48,034
Hey, hey, hey!

744
00:39:48,421 --> 00:39:49,560
Easy! Whoa!

745
00:39:50,631 --> 00:39:51,695
Take it easy.

746
00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:55,060
Mr. Calley, you're under arrest

747
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:58,674
for the kidnapping  of Justin Church and the murder of Tracy Oppen.

748
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,576
Detective Scanlon, read him his rights.

749
00:40:10,038 --> 00:40:10,872
Hi.

750
00:40:13,383 --> 00:40:14,404
Well, hi.

751
00:40:16,695 --> 00:40:17,598
Hannah sick?

752
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,684
You guys have a fight?

753
00:40:23,965 --> 00:40:25,209
What's the deal?

754
00:40:26,113 --> 00:40:27,009
I don't know.

755
00:40:27,107 --> 00:40:29,297
I just don't want to walk home anymore.

756
00:40:29,348 --> 00:40:31,066
I want to ride home with you.

757
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,376
I want it back the way it was.

758
00:40:34,112 --> 00:40:36,170
Wow. Me, too.

759
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:37,369
Good.

760
00:40:38,571 --> 00:40:40,685
If only life worked that way.

761
00:40:41,768 --> 00:40:42,832
What do you mean?

762
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:45,447
You can ride home with me.

763
00:40:45,919 --> 00:40:47,805
You can always ride home with me.

764
00:40:48,897 --> 00:40:51,563
But you can't undo whatever it is that happened.

765
00:40:52,577 --> 00:40:54,486
What makes you think something happened?

766
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:56,956
Well, something must have happened to make you not want to walk home

767
00:40:57,007 --> 00:40:59,744
when it was so important to you a few days ago.

768
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:03,625
Was it something dangerous?

769
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:07,329
Was it something scary?

770
00:41:08,931 --> 00:41:10,281
Just something upsetting.

771
00:41:12,602 --> 00:41:13,229
Yeah.

772
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:15,555
Life is full of those.

773
00:41:17,523 --> 00:41:18,891
All right, then.
Here's what we can do.

774
00:41:18,942 --> 00:41:20,224
I can drive you home.

775
00:41:20,662 --> 00:41:23,990
I can drive you home for the rest of your life if you want.

776
00:41:26,493 --> 00:41:28,463
Of course, you might lose a friend.

777
00:41:29,296 --> 00:41:33,641
And you might miss out on one or two really wonderful experiences.

778
00:41:35,764 --> 00:41:39,266
Or you can walk home with Hannah-- your friend.

779
00:41:39,826 --> 00:41:44,227
And when you get home, you can tell me-- your mother--

780
00:41:44,278 --> 00:41:46,955
exactly what happened to make you feel that way.

781
00:41:49,636 --> 00:41:53,201
'Cause, honey, even if I don't drive you home,

782
00:41:54,727 --> 00:41:57,193
I will always be waiting there for you.

783
00:42:12,727 --> 00:42:13,822
See you at 4:00.

784
00:42:15,027 --> 00:42:16,131
Maybe even earlier.

785
00:42:19,897 --> 00:42:22,817
Oh, no!
She's not coming back again, is she?

786
00:42:23,237 --> 00:42:25,315
Oh, shh! Don't be silly.

787
00:42:25,513 --> 00:42:26,839
She never really left.

788
00:42:29,605 --> 00:42:32,622
