00:00:01,283 --> 00:00:02,266
Breakfirst's ready !

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:05,768
Everybody ! Lunch !

3
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:09,013
Lunch! lunch ! lunch, lunch, luuuunnch !!!

4
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:13,558
Hi, someone please tell me
what's happening up there ?

5
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:17,636
It's impossible to fire with all that ... 
lumber out there in the middle of the yard.

6
00:00:17,953 --> 00:00:21,699
You know, it's, it's a skateboard ramp
or it's going to be whenever he finishes it.

7
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,471
When he finishes it...

8
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:30,089
Well, what do you want to know ?

9
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,361
Look, it's simple, you're living 
in a house with five other people.

10
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:34,199
The backyard is everybody's backyard

11
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:37,703
so you can't let your project sitting 
out there in the middle of the yard.

12
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:40,505
- I don't understand why it's so a bid deal,
-You have to put it away.

13
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:43,271
I mean if it's in your way, 
you can moove it, I won't get mad.

14
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:44,616
Brian, you're missing the point.

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,184
I don't want to put your things away.

16
00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:48,599
No one else in this family
wants to put your things away.

17
00:00:49,385 --> 00:00:50,346
You're 15.

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,432
I shouldn't have to explain
common courtesy to you.

19
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:56,394
No, no, not salad. Anything but salad.

20
00:00:56,737 --> 00:00:58,511
I don't want to hear anything about salad.

21
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:01,966
Brian?

22
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:03,898
Are you okay?

23
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:04,789
Yeah.

24
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:06,942
Here, drink that.

25
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:07,682
No.

26
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:10,185
You all right?

27
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:11,610
No.

28
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:13,282
Joe.

29
00:01:16,883 --> 00:01:18,177
Try and spit it out.

30
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:19,962
Cough it up.

31
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,338
Come on, now.

32
00:01:33,158 --> 00:01:34,250
You okay?

33
00:01:36,716 --> 00:01:38,011
No. Yeah.

34
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:41,745
It's nothing.

35
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:45,023
It's almost spring.

36
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:49,320
I had a Brian dream.

37
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:53,246
I guess I was due.

38
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,054
Hey, what are you doing?

39
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,871
Where are you going?

40
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:04,180
It's not even 6:00 a.m.

41
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:07,084
I screwed up. We're all out of coffee.

42
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:10,789
I was at the market,
I had it on my list and everything.

43
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:12,258
I don't know what happened.

44
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:13,822
We're all out.

45
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,540
Okay. We're all out.

46
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,278
We'll drink tea.

47
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:22,045
We'll drink that nasty flavored stuff
that my mother gave us for Christmas.

48
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:23,768
I'll go get the coffee.

49
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,981
Hey, where you going?

50
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:27,475
I'm going to get coffee.

51
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:30,530
What time did you get up, Al?

52
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,461
Hmm, 5:00 a.m.?

53
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:33,568
4:00?

54
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:35,152
3:00?

55
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:37,940
What difference does it make?

56
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:40,100
A while ago. And I've done nothing

57
00:02:40,798 --> 00:02:42,447
except get myself very upset.

58
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:45,089
So why don't you cut me a little slack
and just let me get in the car

59
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:48,144
and maybe cry a little where
no one can see me or hear me

60
00:02:48,526 --> 00:02:50,315
and I will come home with a sack of coffee.

61
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:52,515
It's been 15 years, Al.

62
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,305
For God's sake, cut yourself
a little bit of slack.

63
00:02:56,923 --> 00:02:57,847
It was nothing.

64
00:02:58,456 --> 00:03:02,658
It was Mother Nature's way of saying she didn't
get things quite right the first time, that's all.

65
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:05,205
- God, don't give me a biology lesson.
- And to hurry up and to try again,

66
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,413
which we did.

67
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:07,610
Just let me get the coffee.

68
00:03:07,957 --> 00:03:08,919
And it worked out great.

69
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:18,801
Are you guys not open yet?

70
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:20,899
Um, manager hasn't shown up.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,742
She's supposed to be here at 5:30
for the morning rush, but...

72
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,994
I think I have her cell number.

73
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:26,501
It's almost 6:30.

74
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:37,411
I hear something.

75
00:03:42,592 --> 00:03:44,187
I wonder why she isn't answering.

76
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:47,933
Don't hang up.

77
00:03:49,148 --> 00:03:50,200
I think I hear something inside.

78
00:03:51,082 --> 00:03:52,013
I'm getting her voice mail.

79
00:03:52,627 --> 00:03:53,915
Hang up. Call again.

80
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,218
Hang up, call the police.

81
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,149
Watch out, please.

82
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:09,525
- Help me with this.
- What...

83
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:10,560
Help me with this.

84
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:21,095
She must really be jonesing for that latte.

85
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:34,539
Hello?

86
00:05:34,995 --> 00:05:36,837
Cancel that APB. I'm fine.

87
00:05:36,873 --> 00:05:40,233
I'm at The Coffee Palace and
have been for the last... hour.

88
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:43,263
Okay. You're okay. Good. I'm glad.

89
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,349
It's not what you think. I got here,

90
00:05:45,408 --> 00:05:47,834
a woman had been assaulted,
so I called the police,

91
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:49,227
I'm just waiting to hear.

92
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,535
I'm sorry about before.

93
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:54,828
Huh? What? There's nothing
to be sorry about.

94
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:57,761
Um, oh, wait. Scratch that.

95
00:05:58,523 --> 00:05:59,530
You didn't bring home the coffee.

96
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:01,640
You should be deeply sorry.

97
00:06:02,544 --> 00:06:03,699
Am  I taking the girls to school?

98
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:06,893
Uh, could you?

99
00:06:06,906 --> 00:06:08,202
I don't think I could leave right now.

100
00:06:08,928 --> 00:06:10,013
No, I figured.

101
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:12,192
Listen, I got to run.

102
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:14,452
Cool.

103
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,147
They tell me you're the one
who found the body.

104
00:06:23,336 --> 00:06:24,352
Anything you want to tell me?

105
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:26,245
I was just coming to buy some coffee, but

106
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:30,129
it's almost 7:30 in the morning,
we got the District Attorney,

107
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:31,619
someone from the mayor's office.

108
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:32,891
Is there anything I should know?

109
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:35,368
No. Me? I'm just showing the flag.

110
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:37,798
There's been a string of robberies
in the neighborhood

111
00:06:38,152 --> 00:06:40,273
and the local store owners are
up in arms, as you can imagine.

112
00:06:41,337 --> 00:06:42,102
Her?

113
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,602
Victim's  name's Cristin Morehouse.
Age 32. She's the store manager.

114
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:56,431
Looks like she died from blunt
force trauma to the head.

115
00:06:57,489 --> 00:07:00,914
The weapon was most likely a large,
stainless steel thermos they found near the body.

116
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:02,804
They sell them here.

117
00:07:03,112 --> 00:07:05,226
Any theories on how
the perpetrator gained entry?

118
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,914
We still don't know but there's a couple
of hundred missing from the register.

119
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:09,325
So is that official?

120
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:11,329
Are we characterizing
this as a robbery gone bad?

121
00:07:11,443 --> 00:07:13,247
I mean, can I give that to the press?

122
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:16,673
Wait a second...
who robs a store at 6:00 in the morning?

123
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:18,548
There's no real money
at 6:00 in the morning.

124
00:07:19,035 --> 00:07:20,548
What did he still, her change?

125
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,472
I'm  sorry.

126
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,088
I shouldn't have... I just...

127
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,639
God, I would kill for a coffee.

128
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:37,710
What are you doing?

129
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,427
What have you got in there?

130
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:43,940
This isn't your room anymore, Ariel.

131
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:46,494
It's still my house, and if you
have something in there,

132
00:07:46,555 --> 00:07:47,989
I have the right to know what it is.

133
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:49,119
No, you don't.

134
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:52,195
Fine, then let's get dad.

135
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,816
Can you keep a secret?

136
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:54,837
I don't know...

137
00:07:55,397 --> 00:07:57,136
show me what's in
 the closet and I'll tell you.

138
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:04,437
Dad!

139
00:08:11,786 --> 00:08:12,576
Hello?

140
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:14,231
You're home.

141
00:08:14,684 --> 00:08:16,740
You figured that out, huh?

142
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:20,252
Uh, have you been in the garage yet?

143
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:22,917
Come on, man, do your thing.

144
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:25,183
Time's a-wastin'.

145
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:30,685
I hate dogs.

146
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:34,801
Come on.

147
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:35,714
Yes, sir.

148
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:37,065
7:30.

149
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:40,200
I'll be happy to go with you.

150
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,483
Good night.

151
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:47,761
My boss wants me to go to
a memorial service,

152
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:49,645
tomorrow, for Cristin Morehouse.

153
00:08:50,524 --> 00:08:52,090
Apparently there's going
to be a lot press there

154
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,597
and since I'm the one who found the body...

155
00:08:55,255 --> 00:08:55,756
Hmm.

156
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:58,624
So you can handle the kids
tomorrow, and the dog?

157
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:01,155
I left the patio door open.
Maybe he'll run away.

158
00:09:01,472 --> 00:09:02,351
You did not.

159
00:09:02,637 --> 00:09:03,662
All right, I did not.

160
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,514
But what are we going to do?

161
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:07,985
We're gonna make flyers,
see if he belongs to anyone.

162
00:09:08,229 --> 00:09:10,218
Okay, what if he does? 
What do we do then?

163
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:13,020
Bridgette's already
completely attached to him.

164
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,861
I heard her tell Marie that she wanted
to marry him and have his puppies.

165
00:09:18,314 --> 00:09:19,515
I'm serious.

166
00:09:19,152 --> 00:09:20,518
There's no winning on this.

167
00:09:20,523 --> 00:09:22,628
Either his owner comes to claim him

168
00:09:22,718 --> 00:09:25,908
and then I got to rip the dog out
of our sobbing daughter's arms,

169
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:27,336
or he doesn't come to claim him

170
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:31,141
and we're stuck with that mangy
mutt until Marie goes to college

171
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:34,030
and I can lure him under
the wheels of a passing truck.

172
00:09:35,303 --> 00:09:37,063
God is gonna get you.

173
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:39,851
All right, forget the passing truck.
I'll put something in his food.

174
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:42,329
It's much more humane.
He won't feel a thing.

175
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:44,758
You're such a liar.

176
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,615
- You love that dog.
- I do not.

177
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:49,029
- I do not.
- I know you do.

178
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:52,324
All right, so who's gonna
make the flyers, me or you?

179
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:53,440
I'll do it tomorrow.

180
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:55,060
Do you think maybe
I should give him a bath?

181
00:09:56,942 --> 00:09:58,410
A little doggy bath?

182
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:00,922
Hose him down, filthy little critter.

183
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:06,694
Come here.

184
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,601
Oh! What are you doing?

185
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,761
I don't want your spit on me.

186
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:13,714
Do you want them to give you a job?

187
00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:17,311
Well, people don't hire people who
don't wipe their mouths after they eat.

188
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:19,289
You look nice.

189
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:22,600
Go get 'em, kid.

190
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:23,863
Thank you.

191
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:25,840
You're crazy.

192
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:43,374
What?

193
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,433
Oh, I don't know. This.

194
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:49,909
I've just put on this dark
suit too many times,

195
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,260
been driven to too many
memorials, listened to

196
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:56,794
too many politicians promise way too often
that whoever it was didn't die in vain.

197
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,007
That now we're going
to do something different,

198
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,512
now we're gonna make it safe.

199
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:04,561
Even made the speech
myself a couple of times.

200
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:06,107
Sorry.

201
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:09,048
It's just I know we'll never
get these two hours back.

202
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:10,905
Still no leads?

203
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:11,803
One.

204
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:14,735
Turns out Cristin Morehouse and her
husband were going through a bad time.

205
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,934
Police were even called
to the apartment twice.

206
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:18,966
He finally moved out about month ago.

207
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:20,332
What are you saying?

208
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:22,399
I'm not sure I'm really saying anything.

209
00:11:22,477 --> 00:11:25,044
Just  a really smart lady asked me yesterday

210
00:11:25,638 --> 00:11:27,567
"Who robs a store at 6:00 in the morning?"

211
00:11:27,642 --> 00:11:28,794
It got me thinking. Kids

212
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:31,565
or someone she knew that, uh,

213
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,723
really wasn't interested
in the money at all.

214
00:11:39,443 --> 00:11:40,302
Morning.

215
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:42,244
It's the new Deputy Mayor.

216
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:43,639
Congratulations,by the way.

217
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:44,553
Thank you.

218
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,268
I think. I'll let you know in an hour or so.

219
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:48,489
You'll do great.

220
00:11:48,597 --> 00:11:49,643
It's a memorial.

221
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:51,427
It's not like anyone's charging admission.

222
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:55,270
Just tell them that you're going to catch
the bad guys and make the streets safe again.

223
00:11:55,863 --> 00:11:57,292
Hit 'em with the task force thing.

224
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,485
They love the task force thing.

225
00:12:00,698 --> 00:12:03,509
The Mayor, the District Attorney
and the Chief of Police

226
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,118
are all keenly aware that robbery
and, yes, even murder,

227
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:11,829
have become far too
matter-of-fact in Saguaro Heights.

228
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:13,616
With that in mind,

229
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,484
the Mayor has authorized
a special task force

230
00:12:16,885 --> 00:12:18,996
charged with addressing neighborhood crime

231
00:12:19,122 --> 00:12:21,034
in the Saguaro Heights area.

232
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:23,603
Found the husband.

233
00:12:24,168 --> 00:12:25,304
He's coming in to talk.

234
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,985
And here comes the press.

235
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:28,832
James.

236
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:31,627
This is Allison Dubois.
She works in my office.

237
00:12:31,744 --> 00:12:34,704
You might want to speak with her.
She's the one who actually discovered the body.

238
00:12:35,057 --> 00:12:35,911
Excuse me.

239
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:36,986
Is that true?

240
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,596
Uh... uh-huh. Yesterday morning.

241
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:45,156
Uh... I-I couldn't sleep so I woke up
early and I was looking for a coffee place.

242
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:47,520
As someone who works
in the prosecutor's office,

243
00:12:47,604 --> 00:12:51,416
do you think there's any truth to the charge
by locals that this area is under-policed?

244
00:12:51,523 --> 00:12:54,281
That some of the wealthier communities
in the town get more city protection?

245
00:12:57,113 --> 00:12:58,372
Ma'am would you answer to that ?

246
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:03,972
Ma'am?

247
00:13:09,043 --> 00:13:10,758
You're saying you haven't
seen your wife since...

248
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,205
A week ago Saturday.

249
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,956
She called and said there was
a problem with the garbage disposal.

250
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:16,195
I went over to the house to fix it.

251
00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:20,152
I mean, it's my house, too.
She's still my wife.

252
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:22,522
I mean...

253
00:13:24,031 --> 00:13:26,074
she was.

254
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:29,639
If you don't mind my asking,

255
00:13:29,997 --> 00:13:32,106
What exactly was the trouble
between you and your wife?

256
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:33,487
So what's your sense of him?

257
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:35,062
Excuse me?

258
00:13:35,303 --> 00:13:36,864
Our guys here, what do you think?

259
00:13:39,622 --> 00:13:40,879
I don't really have a sense.

260
00:13:42,384 --> 00:13:44,861
But mostly it was the kids thing.

261
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:47,344
We both wanted kids.

262
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:53,004
There were problems.

263
00:13:54,988 --> 00:13:57,195
No matter what we did,
we couldn't seem to get pregnant.

264
00:13:58,153 --> 00:14:00,058
Well, that must have been tough on both of you.

265
00:14:00,892 --> 00:14:01,936
She blamed herself.

266
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:04,015
Way before I knew her, she...

267
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,321
I mean...

268
00:14:08,538 --> 00:14:10,005
she had problems with drugs.

269
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,659
- But she wouldn't talk about it...
- A place like The Coffee Palace.

270
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:15,967
They have to have employee files.

271
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:18,684
Is there any way I could get a look at those?

272
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:20,794
Job applications-- that kind of thing?

273
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:24,296
I think Lee's already ahead of you
on this. I saw the files on his desk.

274
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:26,958
Feel free to have a look at
them when we're done here.

275
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,695
Jessie  Andrews.

276
00:15:06,056 --> 00:15:06,860
Wow.

277
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:11,826
So, I mean, by that point,
I already had his address.

278
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,176
Wait a second, you didn't
actually go there, did you?

279
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:16,539
How could I not?

280
00:15:17,305 --> 00:15:20,100
I mean, I didn't actually go up
to his door and knock.

281
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,076
But I drove by. I parked across the street.

282
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:25,209
Al, Al, Al.

283
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:26,888
How could I not?

284
00:15:27,314 --> 00:15:30,237
See where he lives,
see the color of his house,

285
00:15:30,665 --> 00:15:33,827
what his street looks like,
who his neighbors might be.

286
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:35,984
Al, it's easy-- you just don't go.

287
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,838
You don't understand.

288
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:39,350
No, Allison, I do.

289
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:40,740
I understand completely.

290
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:43,291
You had a dream about our unborn child.

291
00:15:43,532 --> 00:15:46,888
And in that dream,
our unborn child looked a lot like

292
00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:49,443
this kid that you saw at this memorial service.

293
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:51,819
And that's it-- that's the whole connection.

294
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,243
Look, Allison...

295
00:15:56,986 --> 00:15:58,275
take a step back.

296
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:00,215
Get a little perspective.

297
00:16:01,022 --> 00:16:04,344
Joe, he looked exactly like...

298
00:16:04,444 --> 00:16:06,280
Fine, but that doesn't
mean that he's our son.

299
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:08,615
That doesn't mean that he's anything to us,

300
00:16:08,737 --> 00:16:10,520
except a kid in a dream.

301
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:14,257
Look, you go to this coffee shop once,
maybe twice a month, right?

302
00:16:15,404 --> 00:16:18,877
Well, isn't it possible that you saw him there
and that you just don't remember?

303
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:23,368
And that you bore his face, and you put it...
you gave it to the kid in your dream?

304
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:28,313
Daddy, Angus is scratching at the patio door!

305
00:16:28,464 --> 00:16:29,588
Yeah, I'll be right there, Bridge.

306
00:16:32,494 --> 00:16:33,951
Look, I-I'm sorry.

307
00:16:34,103 --> 00:16:36,523
I... I know that you're
going through something,

308
00:16:36,731 --> 00:16:40,257
and I want to...
I want to say something to make it...

309
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:41,947
I don't know,not hurt so bad.

310
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:46,156
Mom! Mom!

311
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:49,416
Brian!

312
00:16:50,787 --> 00:16:52,592
It's Mrs. Morehouse-- she's dead!

313
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:55,702
I'm sorry! She's just dead!

314
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,410
What are you talking about? What happened?

315
00:16:58,085 --> 00:16:58,553
Brian...

316
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:01,597
Brian, answer me!

317
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,223
Why were you there?!

318
00:17:03,475 --> 00:17:05,228
You are not supposed to go there anymore!

319
00:17:05,488 --> 00:17:06,685
What were you thinking?!

320
00:17:07,145 --> 00:17:07,747
Brian!

321
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:13,696
Brian.

322
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:30,021
Okay... okay...

323
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:34,162
Okay, we-we-we've got
everything under control now.

324
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:41,811
I'll take care of your clothes.

325
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:48,986
You finish your bath.

326
00:17:52,576 --> 00:17:53,974
And when you're done with your bath...

327
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,033
I want you to take a shower.

328
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:02,097
And when you're done with your shower,

329
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,097
I want you to take another bath.

330
00:18:04,922 --> 00:18:05,508
And...

331
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:08,021
when you're all finished...

332
00:18:12,831 --> 00:18:14,041
call me in and I'll...

333
00:18:15,197 --> 00:18:16,333
I'll clean everything up.

334
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,171
Oh...

335
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:30,458
Hello.

336
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:31,756
Good morning.

337
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,143
This is your official civil servant wake-up call.

338
00:18:34,816 --> 00:18:37,055
Mr. District Attorney.

339
00:18:37,427 --> 00:18:39,923
I think we have a viable suspect
in the Morehouse case.

340
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:42,366
And I've just authorized
Detective Scanlon to make contact

341
00:18:42,547 --> 00:18:44,961
and see if we can't bring him in here
and have a conversation.

342
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,226
And I was hoping you might be able to join us.

343
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:49,566
Wait a second, I'm confused.
What about the husband?

344
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,797
The husband has a rock-solid alibi.

345
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,928
Turns out he was with a woman
the morning of the murder.

346
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,981
A married woman, no less.
And not withstanding

347
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,843
the obvious embarassement for all involvment,

348
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,502
she's willing to corroborate his whereabouts.

349
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:03,885
I expect to hear  from Scanlon any minute.

350
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:06,569
I wanted him to speak with this kid
before he left home to go to school.

351
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:09,205
A kid?

352
00:19:09,637 --> 00:19:12,627
Yeah, we're zeroing in on one of the suspects
who worked there, if you can believe it.

353
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:17,770
A boy named Andrews. Uh, Jessie Andrews.

354
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:28,977
I don't know. I mean,
I figured the first boss I'd have

355
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:31,921
would be some big fat guy who'd yell at me.

356
00:19:32,957 --> 00:19:36,367
And she wasn't like that.
She was really nice and-and pretty

357
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:39,614
and... you could talk to her about stuff.

358
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:43,277
She'd just talk back to you.

359
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:47,388
I don't know, I-I really...
I really liked it there.

360
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:48,570
She made it really nice.

361
00:19:48,947 --> 00:19:51,005
Some of the other kids said
you were buying her things.

362
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:53,562
It was for her birthday.

363
00:19:53,686 --> 00:19:55,431
The other kids told him
that it was her birthday,

364
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,754
so he brought her some perfume.

365
00:19:57,189 --> 00:20:00,801
It's nice, that's a very nice
thing for a young man to do.

366
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,074
You should be very proud.

367
00:20:03,596 --> 00:20:05,115
Okay, so you bought her some perfume.

368
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:08,409
Um, he didn't really buy it. He...

369
00:20:09,097 --> 00:20:12,367
borrowed it from my dresser. I mean...

370
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,643
It was expensive.

371
00:20:17,252 --> 00:20:19,255
I think she was a little thrown by it.

372
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:25,061
Jessie, do you think that contributed
to her decision to let you go?

373
00:20:26,786 --> 00:20:27,837
You guys know about that?

374
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:30,800
We looked at your employee file
and some of your former colleagues

375
00:20:30,957 --> 00:20:33,494
filled us in on what happened, yes.

376
00:20:34,952 --> 00:20:36,313
I think it was both ways.

377
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:41,568
I think... I mean, maybe I wasn't
concentrating enough at work, 'cause...

378
00:20:43,904 --> 00:20:47,406
I like... talking to her.

379
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,550
But I also think that she really
liked talking to me when I was around.

380
00:20:53,688 --> 00:20:55,972
So, I don't know, I guess...

381
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:58,814
I don't-I don't blame her.

382
00:20:59,512 --> 00:21:01,628
So you weren't mad at her?

383
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:04,938
I mean, when she we was still alive
you weren't angry with her, right?

384
00:21:05,408 --> 00:21:07,235
No. God, no. I just...

385
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:09,964
missed her.

386
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:14,335
I still miss her.

387
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:16,394
Okay?

388
00:21:18,498 --> 00:21:21,507
So, she fired you.

389
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:23,892
But you didn't stay away.

390
00:21:26,132 --> 00:21:30,221
Obviously, Jessie didn't handle things
as well as he might have.

391
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,565
He  didn't tell me that he'd been fired at first.

392
00:21:32,984 --> 00:21:36,728
I think perhaps he was embarrassed.

393
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:42,206
Be that as it may, it's our understanding
that things got a bit emotional.

394
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:44,673
It was his first job.

395
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,204
He didn't want to lose it.

396
00:21:46,504 --> 00:21:47,329
Of course not.

397
00:21:48,812 --> 00:21:52,220
Jessie, could you tell us where you were
Wednesday morning between 5:00 and 6:00 a.m.?

398
00:21:55,456 --> 00:21:59,561
Is my son being accused of something here?

399
00:21:59,797 --> 00:22:01,348
No one is being accused of anything.

400
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:04,057
Every employee at The Coffee Palace
has been interviewed

401
00:22:04,184 --> 00:22:06,743
and every employee at The Coffee Palace
has answered that question.

402
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:10,112
If you'd like to stop and
find Jessie an attorney,

403
00:22:10,478 --> 00:22:11,462
we'll certainly understand.

404
00:22:11,661 --> 00:22:13,806
But in my opinion,
if he has nothing to hide,

405
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,671
then it would be a foolish waste of
time and money.  But it is up to you.

406
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:26,310
Go ahead, Jess.

407
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:28,727
- I was sleeping at home.
- Can anybody verify that?

408
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:32,570
I can. I got home from
the hospital around 4:30.

409
00:22:32,648 --> 00:22:33,341
In the morning?

410
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:36,017
I had performed an emergency C-section.
I'm an obstetrician.

411
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:39,224
Anyway, I peeked in on him,
as I always do, and there he was.

412
00:22:40,513 --> 00:22:42,424
Was there anybody else at home with you, Dr. Andrews?

413
00:22:42,676 --> 00:22:43,182
No.

414
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,757
I'm not married, Detective.

415
00:22:44,857 --> 00:22:47,622
It's just the two of us,

416
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,489
Jessie and me.

417
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:52,903
May I ask what size shoe you wear, Jessie?

418
00:22:53,063 --> 00:22:53,812
Excuse me.

419
00:22:54,631 --> 00:22:56,995
Did you ask all the other employees that?

420
00:22:57,652 --> 00:23:00,888
Dr. Andrews, I'm sure you read the papers,

421
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:04,486
and I'm sure you know how much pressure
we're all under to get to the bottom of this.

422
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:09,416
But we can't do that until we can eliminate all
the people that had contact with Mrs. Morehouse.

423
00:23:13,485 --> 00:23:16,097
We found footprints in the
victim's blood at the scene.

424
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:19,935
The tread marks indicate they came from a pair of size nine sneakers.

425
00:23:20,142 --> 00:23:23,570
I'm no detective, but aren't there
a lot of people who wear size nine?

426
00:23:24,175 --> 00:23:24,988
Thank you.

427
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,445
You ever own a pair of Z-Jams, Jess?

428
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:28,915
You don't have to answer that.

429
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:32,922
We came down here voluntarily
to help your investigation.

430
00:23:33,264 --> 00:23:36,652
If you're going to make my son out
as a suspect, I will find a lawyer.

431
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:38,481
That's absolutely your prerogative, Dr. Andrews.

432
00:23:40,131 --> 00:23:42,709
- I wouldn't hurt her...
- No. Not another word, Jess.

433
00:24:29,186 --> 00:24:32,277
Mom, Bridgette's giving Angus our breakfast.

434
00:24:32,448 --> 00:24:33,076
Bridgette...

435
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,362
Angus has his food and we have ours.

436
00:24:36,132 --> 00:24:37,173
Just checked my cell.

437
00:24:37,513 --> 00:24:39,683
No calls overnight to claim our friend here.

438
00:24:40,138 --> 00:24:41,718
Does that mean we get to keep him?

439
00:24:42,408 --> 00:24:43,106
Uh-oh.

440
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,547
You know what, let's just
take it one step at a time.

441
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:50,279
Give it a few more days.

442
00:24:59,107 --> 00:25:00,139
Nobody wants that dog.

443
00:25:00,423 --> 00:25:01,450
Bridgette wants that dog.

444
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,919
I guess I got to go find a truck.

445
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:07,064
So, what are you thinking?

446
00:25:07,261 --> 00:25:09,751
I'm thinking that maybe
I'll drop him off at the vet

447
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,449
on my way to work this morning,

448
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,196
do some due diligence,
see if he's got all his shots.

449
00:25:15,856 --> 00:25:19,483
At least that way, if we decide to keep him,
we'd know what to expect.

450
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,699
Hey, good looking, what's cooking?

451
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:29,474
Fish.

452
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,321
You want to check this place out with me?

453
00:25:33,745 --> 00:25:35,838
I really appreciate you staying
open these extra 15 minutes.

454
00:25:36,126 --> 00:25:38,277
I tried to get off work early and then the phone rang...

455
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:39,176
No, no, no, no.

456
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,234
When they explained to me that you
and Angus were new clients...

457
00:25:43,607 --> 00:25:45,949
Mr. Dubois, did you say this dog was a stray?

458
00:25:46,785 --> 00:25:50,795
Well, yeah. My daughter brought
him home a few days ago.

459
00:25:51,178 --> 00:25:53,387
So, she's not too attached to him then?

460
00:25:54,462 --> 00:25:55,547
She's, well...

461
00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:58,386
You know kids, she's, uh...

462
00:25:59,188 --> 00:26:00,388
she's very attached.

463
00:26:01,512 --> 00:26:03,073
Are you saying he belongs to somebody else?

464
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,143
I'm saying that he's sick.

465
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:07,059
He's sick? What's wrong with him?

466
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,659
Well, for starters,

467
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:11,248
I'd say he's about 12 years old.

468
00:26:11,642 --> 00:26:15,291
So in dog years, that's... 84. He's 84?

469
00:26:15,477 --> 00:26:18,497
Well, the age thing is not
an exact science, but...

470
00:26:18,853 --> 00:26:20,119
it's about right, yeah.

471
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:24,466
Even with a simple examination,
I can tell you that his liver's enlarged,

472
00:26:24,638 --> 00:26:26,637
his eyesight is going, and...

473
00:26:26,906 --> 00:26:29,129
his breathing is clearly labored.

474
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:32,115
Is he going to be okay?

475
00:26:33,282 --> 00:26:34,512
I wish I had better news.

476
00:26:36,844 --> 00:26:39,776
So what are you saying?
Are you saying, he's going to die?

477
00:26:40,937 --> 00:26:42,050
I'm afraid so.

478
00:26:44,287 --> 00:26:45,512
How long?

479
00:26:46,954 --> 00:26:50,373
Anywhere from a week to a week and a half.

480
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,620
When do you want to tell her?

481
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:55,636
Do we have to tell her?

482
00:26:58,276 --> 00:26:59,296
I don't know.

483
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,327
I'll give you a hundred dollars if you'll do it.

484
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:05,159
No, thanks.

485
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:09,121
I fear I've already destroyed
one child's life for the day.

486
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:10,611
One is my limit.

487
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:18,463
Good news and bad news.

488
00:27:19,135 --> 00:27:20,462
I'll take any news at this point.

489
00:27:21,646 --> 00:27:23,284
The good news is we tested the clothes.

490
00:27:23,452 --> 00:27:25,008
Blood came from Cristin Morehouse.

491
00:27:25,156 --> 00:27:27,605
And the sneakers match the
footprints from the crime scene.

492
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:31,396
A laundry tag on the shirt is
traceable back to Jessie Andrews.

493
00:27:32,212 --> 00:27:34,151
We got a squad car on the way
to pick him up right now.

494
00:27:34,851 --> 00:27:37,613
And the bad news is, obviously,
we haven't gotten to the bottom

495
00:27:37,778 --> 00:27:39,338
of the bigger crime problem
in the neighborhood,

496
00:27:39,514 --> 00:27:41,066
but I'll take my victorieswhere I can get them.

497
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:42,565
Allison?

498
00:27:44,678 --> 00:27:48,670
Congratulations. If you'll excuse me,
I'm not feeling terribly well.

499
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,462
Feeling any better?

500
00:27:57,485 --> 00:27:58,363
I'm sorry?

501
00:27:59,575 --> 00:28:01,040
I asked if you were feeling any better.

502
00:28:01,197 --> 00:28:02,766
You said you were going
to leave almost two hours ago.

503
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:06,417
Well, to answer your question, no,
I don't-I don't feel any better.

504
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:07,851
I feel horrible.

505
00:28:11,682 --> 00:28:16,459
You asked me the other day if I though that
boy was innocent and I didn't say anything.

506
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:23,903
Because, honestly, everything that I
dreamed tells me that he is guilty as hell.

507
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:26,702
But what I can't make sense of...

508
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:31,460
is everything I feel...

509
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:35,624
tells me to protect him.

510
00:28:36,568 --> 00:28:38,179
Like a parent, like a mother.

511
00:28:41,913 --> 00:28:45,462
For what it's worth, just now when they
brought him in to book him he finally admitted that

512
00:28:45,503 --> 00:28:47,176
he did go see Morehouse that morning.

513
00:28:47,552 --> 00:28:49,980
Knew she'd be there all by
herself opening up the store.

514
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:55,218
Of course, he claimed that she was
already dead when he got there,

515
00:28:55,372 --> 00:28:57,785
not that he called the police or anything.

516
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,222
I mean, if it makes you feel any better.

517
00:29:01,433 --> 00:29:02,693
Well, maybe he's telling the truth.

518
00:29:02,806 --> 00:29:04,172
Maybe she was dead when he found her.

519
00:29:04,378 --> 00:29:04,986
Allison...

520
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,621
Couldn't we at least consider the possibility?

521
00:29:07,196 --> 00:29:10,422
Take another look at the husband,
or the woman that he was seeing?

522
00:29:10,564 --> 00:29:12,626
Maybe she was the one who
wanted Cristin out of the picture.

523
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,269
Okay, I'm going to go back to work now.

524
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:18,213
Deal with some cases that are truly
unresolved and in need of some attention.

525
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:19,440
Okay, you know what?

526
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:21,951
If it's all the same to you,
can I just take another look at the files?

527
00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:25,182
Thank you.

528
00:29:29,605 --> 00:29:31,075
How goes the fine-tooth combing?

529
00:29:32,531 --> 00:29:33,592
Actually, I'm confused.

530
00:29:33,804 --> 00:29:35,350
Your boss mentioned that.

531
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,969
That's not what I'm talking about.

532
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:41,030
Kevin Morehouse said his wife
wasn't able to have children,

533
00:29:41,294 --> 00:29:42,786
but, according to the coroner's report,

534
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:47,348
the shape of her uterus is indicative of her
having given birth at some point in her life.

535
00:29:48,192 --> 00:29:49,267
Okay.

536
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:53,597
Look, I'm not sure where you're
going with this, but you should know,

537
00:29:53,698 --> 00:29:55,883
the kid's lawyer is on his way
down here now to talk deal.

538
00:29:58,217 --> 00:29:59,685
I'm sorry, Allison, but the kid's guilty,

539
00:30:00,025 --> 00:30:01,119
and even his attorney knows it.

540
00:30:02,939 --> 00:30:03,864
Let me tell you what we know.

541
00:30:05,524 --> 00:30:09,237
We know that your client had something
of an obsession with Mrs. Morehouse.

542
00:30:09,328 --> 00:30:12,880
We also know that he had a confrontation
with her the day she died,

543
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:16,731
and she was upset to the point of calling
the young man's mother to take him home.

544
00:30:17,407 --> 00:30:21,065
We know that a bag of his blood-spattered clothing
was found in a Dumpster earlier this morning,

545
00:30:21,191 --> 00:30:24,270
and the the blood was a perfect
match for that of Mrs. Morehouse.

546
00:30:28,638 --> 00:30:29,988
Now I'll tell you what I think.

547
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:34,306
I think I have more than enough here
to make a case against your client.

548
00:30:35,908 --> 00:30:38,810
And I think if I try him as an adult,
that the jury won't hesitate

549
00:30:39,668 --> 00:30:40,984
to give him the maximum sentence.

550
00:30:45,046 --> 00:30:48,448
He's barely 15 years old.

551
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:55,034
You're talking about taking away
the next 30 years of his life.

552
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:58,441
I'd be lying if I said that Jessie's
age didn't give me pause.

553
00:30:59,534 --> 00:31:02,954
Which is the only reason
that I will consider a deal.

554
00:31:03,412 --> 00:31:05,495
Provided he signs a full confession,

555
00:31:05,903 --> 00:31:07,300
I'll recommend manslaughter.

556
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:09,751
Four years in a juvenile detention facility.

557
00:31:10,188 --> 00:31:12,913
If, however, you'd rather take this to trial,

558
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:16,224
know that I will prosecute Jessie as an adult,
and I will seek the maximum.

559
00:31:18,195 --> 00:31:19,410
Feel free to talk it over.

560
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,098
You've got 15 minutes.

561
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:38,398
How long are you going to do this?

562
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:42,558
For the rest of my life.
You got an issue with that?

563
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:46,953
Not me. Just seems like there's going
to be a lot of wasted space in our bed.

564
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:49,654
Maybe I should put an ad in the paper.

565
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:51,152
See if I can rent out half.

566
00:31:52,513 --> 00:31:53,756
He confessed to everything.

567
00:31:56,343 --> 00:31:57,546
Did he say why he did it?

568
00:32:00,313 --> 00:32:03,276
The day she called his mother
to pick him up, he was humiliated.

569
00:32:03,836 --> 00:32:05,949
So he decided he didn't want it to end that way.

570
00:32:07,755 --> 00:32:08,777
He set his alarm,

571
00:32:10,207 --> 00:32:12,280
woke up early, went back the next morning,

572
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,100
caught her when she was opening up.

573
00:32:16,703 --> 00:32:17,691
She got upset.

574
00:32:19,433 --> 00:32:20,364
He grabbed a thermos.

575
00:32:23,856 --> 00:32:24,940
And what about his real mom?

576
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:27,219
Dr. Andrews? What about her?

577
00:32:27,508 --> 00:32:30,164
Did she confess to putting
his clothes in that Dumpster?

578
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:32,703
No. It didn't come up.

579
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:34,535
And I didn't say anything.

580
00:32:35,632 --> 00:32:36,658
She's an adult, Joe.

581
00:32:36,782 --> 00:32:38,009
She would have done more time

582
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:41,203
for being an accessory than he's
going to do for the actual murder.

583
00:32:42,009 --> 00:32:43,110
So she just gets to walk?

584
00:32:43,573 --> 00:32:45,185
She was just trying to protect her kid.

585
00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:50,102
And at least this way she'll be able to be
there for him when he gets out in four years.

586
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,182
And if you want to know the truth,

587
00:32:53,207 --> 00:32:55,668
if it was Ariel or Bridgette or Marie,

588
00:32:56,252 --> 00:32:58,511
I would have done the exact same thing.

589
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,336
Speaking of protecting your kid,
I don't, I don't suppose

590
00:33:03,457 --> 00:33:07,011
you've come up with any bright ideas
for telling our middle child

591
00:33:07,174 --> 00:33:08,345
that her dog is dying.

592
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,437
Yeah. Me, neither.

593
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,593
Well, I got half a bed to try and rent.

594
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:17,725
See ya.

595
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:34,764
Jessie's manager?

596
00:33:35,436 --> 00:33:35,907
Uh...

597
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:37,429
Cristin.

598
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,636
Uh, Mrs. Morehouse.

599
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:41,469
Dr. Andrews?

600
00:33:44,932 --> 00:33:47,355
I-I am so sorry about Jessie.

601
00:33:47,636 --> 00:33:48,670
Have we met before ?

602
00:33:49,366 --> 00:33:50,611
No, I don't believe we have, no.

603
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:54,932
Are you sure?

604
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:57,809
What kind of doctor are
you exactly? If I can ask.

605
00:33:58,749 --> 00:34:01,430
I have to run. I'm due back
at the hospital in 20 minutes.

606
00:34:02,004 --> 00:34:04,383
I'm terribly sorry.
He will not bother you again.

607
00:34:07,204 --> 00:34:08,234
Dr. Andrews?

608
00:34:09,751 --> 00:34:11,095
Dr. Andrews!

609
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:14,406
Dr. Andrews!

610
00:34:17,662 --> 00:34:19,204
He's mine, isn't he?!

611
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:20,698
He's mine!

612
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:22,292
Mine...

613
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,601
He's mine!

614
00:34:24,672 --> 00:34:25,739
What does she mean?

615
00:34:26,823 --> 00:34:27,942
What's she yelling about?

616
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,529
Nothing, honey.

617
00:34:29,808 --> 00:34:31,209
Absolutely nothing.

618
00:34:41,115 --> 00:34:42,636
Come in.

619
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:47,748
I know I'm a little late.
The hospital was just...

620
00:34:48,496 --> 00:34:49,496
I understand.

621
00:34:50,187 --> 00:34:52,147
I'm glad I caught you
while you were in the city.

622
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,215
No, as soon as you said it might help Jessie...

623
00:34:56,067 --> 00:34:57,099
How's he doing?

624
00:34:58,377 --> 00:35:00,537
As well as can be expected.

625
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,150
Considering.

626
00:35:03,146 --> 00:35:05,910
I just... there's some inconsistencies in here

627
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,822
and I was hoping you could
help me clear them up.

628
00:35:08,435 --> 00:35:11,210
Anything I can tell you.
Anything you want to know.

629
00:35:13,141 --> 00:35:17,152
Uh, Dr. Andrews, the, the night
before Cristin Morehouse died,

630
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,070
the night she called you and
had you come and pick up Jessie,

631
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:21,703
was that the first time you'd ever met her?

632
00:35:22,691 --> 00:35:24,632
I believe so, yes.

633
00:35:25,362 --> 00:35:26,779
All right. Well, here's the thing.

634
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:29,570
I was looking through
Cristin's autopsy report,

635
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:33,577
and apparently she'd given birth
to a child at some point in her life.

636
00:35:34,228 --> 00:35:35,070
All right.

637
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:38,644
Well, it made me curious because
her husband said that infertility

638
00:35:39,618 --> 00:35:40,961
was a real issue for them.

639
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,811
So I-I did some checking, and I...

640
00:35:46,299 --> 00:35:47,946
came across this death certificate.

641
00:35:50,951 --> 00:35:54,466
Apparently she had  given birth to
a child many years before her marriage.

642
00:35:56,178 --> 00:35:59,988
The baby had died moments
after it came into the world.

643
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:03,982
What am I looking at here?

644
00:36:04,236 --> 00:36:06,566
You signed the death certificate, Dr. Andrews.

645
00:36:07,255 --> 00:36:08,233
You were there.

646
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:14,996
All right.

647
00:36:16,064 --> 00:36:17,623
Yes, that's my signature.

648
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:18,444
It...

649
00:36:19,522 --> 00:36:21,216
15 years ago.

650
00:36:22,454 --> 00:36:23,758
A different last name.

651
00:36:24,977 --> 00:36:27,708
I honestly have no recollection of the woman.

652
00:36:28,026 --> 00:36:30,581
Well, here's another interesting thing--
contradiction-wise.

653
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:37,892
Apparently, on the night you were
presiding over the death of Cristin's son,

654
00:36:39,308 --> 00:36:39,903
you...

655
00:36:42,747 --> 00:36:45,710
were also giving birth to one of your own.

656
00:36:48,783 --> 00:36:50,397
Dr. Andrews.

657
00:36:58,751 --> 00:37:03,516
15 years ago I was an intern volunteering
a few hours a week at a clinic downtown.

658
00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:08,407
One night a woman stumbled in,
high like most of our patients.

659
00:37:08,724 --> 00:37:10,731
She said she was in a lot of pain,
she didn't know why.

660
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:15,595
After a short exam, I told her she was eight
months pregnant and she was in labor.

661
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:16,921
She didn't know.

662
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:18,341
She didn't want to know.

663
00:37:19,344 --> 00:37:21,496
She told me her whole life
was about doing drugs.

664
00:37:21,558 --> 00:37:23,133
She didn't know who the father was.
She didn't care.

665
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,737
I told her the baby was comingand
she looked at me and said,

666
00:37:29,661 --> 00:37:33,617
people pay a lot for a white baby, right?"

667
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:37,410
What did I think she could get for it?

668
00:37:39,113 --> 00:37:41,665
She was in pain, so I gave her
something to help her sleep,

669
00:37:42,486 --> 00:37:44,494
and an hour later, Jessie came into the world.

670
00:37:46,419 --> 00:37:48,094
I cleaned him up, wrapped him in a blanket,

671
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:50,898
and I was going to call the police,
but he was shaking so hard.

672
00:37:51,032 --> 00:37:51,642
Shaking?

673
00:37:53,173 --> 00:37:54,862
Jessie was born an addict.

674
00:37:56,794 --> 00:37:58,568
So I just... waited.

675
00:37:59,421 --> 00:38:03,124
And I held him, rocked him
until he quieted down.

676
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:08,811
I can still feel the weight
of his tiny body in my arms.

677
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:10,372
I can still see his sweet face.

678
00:38:11,157 --> 00:38:14,028
He was so helpless, and he just
needed someone to take care of him,

679
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:16,631
someone to protect him, and somehow I knew...

680
00:38:17,657 --> 00:38:19,425
that person had to be me.

681
00:38:20,934 --> 00:38:23,385
My life as I knew it was over.

682
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:26,763
I gave it to him. I gave him...

683
00:38:29,613 --> 00:38:30,777
everything I had.

684
00:38:34,704 --> 00:38:36,179
You became his mother.

685
00:38:56,966 --> 00:38:58,355
When Cristin woke up,

686
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:01,372
I told her the baby had died.

687
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:03,988
I knew what I was doing was wrong,

688
00:39:05,114 --> 00:39:07,621
but I swear to you, Mrs. Dubois,if anything,

689
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:09,790
she was relieved.

690
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:13,007
And that's when I knew,
this was the best thing for everybody.

691
00:39:13,165 --> 00:39:14,652
It was certainly the best thing for Jessie.

692
00:39:14,798 --> 00:39:16,108
And you never saw her again.

693
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,846
We moved to Tempe, he and I.

694
00:39:18,661 --> 00:39:19,843
No one knew us, no one cared.

695
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:22,689
We moved here to Phoenix three years later.

696
00:39:22,801 --> 00:39:26,778
I-I supposed she was long gone,
probably long dead.

697
00:39:28,394 --> 00:39:29,563
And then last week...

698
00:39:30,858 --> 00:39:32,549
I went to The Coffee Palace.

699
00:39:35,297 --> 00:39:36,628
She recognized me.

700
00:39:40,272 --> 00:39:41,588
She told me that she was clean now,

701
00:39:41,653 --> 00:39:43,066
that she could be a good mother to Jessie.

702
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,411
She said she had a right to him.

703
00:39:44,491 --> 00:39:47,515
I begged her to be reasonable, to work with me,

704
00:39:49,392 --> 00:39:49,862
but...

705
00:39:51,426 --> 00:39:53,396
she said she would call the police and...

706
00:39:56,885 --> 00:40:00,406
after that, I don't remember what happened
except she was reaching for the phone and...

707
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,143
I must have hit her. I don't even know.

708
00:40:07,522 --> 00:40:09,077
I was so scared I just left.

709
00:40:12,024 --> 00:40:13,104
I just left her there.

710
00:40:13,249 --> 00:40:14,327
Where Jessie found her,

711
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,892
when he went there hoping to talk to her.

712
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:23,577
There are people I need to go get.

713
00:40:23,748 --> 00:40:25,199
There are people that we need to tell.

714
00:40:31,425 --> 00:40:35,339
I know you must think I'm a horrible person,
letting him take the blame for what I did.

715
00:40:35,429 --> 00:40:37,865
But you see, I thought, at least this way,

716
00:40:38,213 --> 00:40:40,138
I can be there for him when he gets out.

717
00:40:40,203 --> 00:40:41,258
And now...

718
00:40:47,183 --> 00:40:48,586
he'll go into foster care.

719
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:54,341
And the only mother he's ever known
will spend the rest of her life apart from him.

720
00:41:01,367 --> 00:41:02,650
Ask yourself, Mrs. Dubois:

721
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,101
Would you have done any
differently if you were in my shoes?

722
00:41:17,478 --> 00:41:18,824
I'll be right back.

723
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:31,558
So you ready to do this?

724
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:35,100
How did I get roped into this?

725
00:41:35,582 --> 00:41:37,359
Thank you. I appreciate your support.

726
00:41:38,736 --> 00:41:39,633
Bridge.

727
00:41:39,946 --> 00:41:41,497
We need to talk to you about something.

728
00:41:41,628 --> 00:41:42,711
Am I in trouble?

729
00:41:42,923 --> 00:41:44,295
You mind if I turn off the TV?

730
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:46,113
What'd I do?

731
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:50,799
Hey, Bridge, do you remember when
I took Angus to the vet the other day?

732
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:54,892
Uh, well, it turns out Angus isn't really okay.

733
00:41:56,184 --> 00:41:57,546
I'm afraid he's very sick.

734
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:00,201
He doesn't have long to live.

735
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:01,695
Yeah, I know.

736
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:03,783
You know?

737
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,726
Sure.

738
00:42:04,801 --> 00:42:06,502
I knew the second I saw him.

739
00:42:07,135 --> 00:42:08,779
He's very old, you know.

740
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:13,797
Bridge, honey, if you
knew he was going to die,

741
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:15,512
why did you ask if we could keep him?

742
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,229
Bridge, honey, why didn't you say something?

743
00:42:18,724 --> 00:42:21,430
Because I knew how much you liked him, Daddy.

744
00:42:21,827 --> 00:42:24,035
And I didn't want to see you all sad.

745
00:42:25,366 --> 00:42:27,509
I don't think I could've handled it.

746
00:42:30,421 --> 00:42:31,344
Aha.

747
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:34,921
Can me and Angus have our cartoons back now?

748
00:42:44,474 --> 00:42:46,037
Did I mention I hate dogs?

749
00:42:46,203 --> 00:42:47,463
Once or twice.

750
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:53,552
