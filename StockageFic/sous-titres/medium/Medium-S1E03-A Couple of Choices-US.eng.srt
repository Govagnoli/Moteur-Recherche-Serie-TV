1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,837

WOMAN: Tim, listen to me.

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:07,507
A certain amount of 
selfishness is good.

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:08,842

A marriage without selfishness

4
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,677
is a marriage 
without pleasure.

5
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:13,263
And a marriage 
without pleasure is doomed.

6
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,141

Yes, we love. Yes, we give.

7
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,643
Yes, we want to 
make our partner happy.

8
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,688
But it's like 
that announcement

9
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:24,775

they make on the airplane.

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,818
If the cabin should 
suddenly lose pressure,

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,780
first you must attend 
to your own oxygen mask,

12
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,616

then put on your child's,

13
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,452

your partner's.

14
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:36,828

Do you follow me?

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,041

Okay, then.

16
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,043

The rest is simple.

17
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:46,880
You want to do 
something with Donna.

18
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,506

To Donna.

19
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,217
You've wanted to 
do it for a long time,

20
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,636

but you thought it was wrong.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,264
You thought Donna 
wouldn't understand.

22
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,434
You thought society 
wouldn't understand.

23
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,896
Well, today 
you're going to do it.

24
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:06,149

Right here. Right now.

25
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,444

Okay. Stand up.

26
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,782

Tim.

27
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,701

Nothing can happen unless you

28
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:18,620

stand up and face your wife.

29
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,705

Now come on.

30
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:23,458

Are you embarrassed?

31
00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:26,878
Are you embarrassed 
to do it in front of me?

32
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:28,338

Don't be embarrassed.

33
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,298

I've seen it all.

34
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,843

Now come on.

35
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:38,222

Stand up and face your wif

36
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,552

( gunshot )

37
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,681

Excellent, Tim.

38
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,642

Excellent job.

39
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:24,935

( gasps )

40
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,395

( groans )

41
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:29,190

What's going on?

42
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,817
We fell asleep 
watching the news.

43
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,527
It's almost 
2:00 in the morning.

44
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:34,570

Yep.

45
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:36,488
Oh, I just had 
the weirdest dream.

46
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,906

Of course you did.

47
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,075

It's a day that ends in "Y".

48
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,754

( birds chirping )

49
00:03:48,268 --> 00:03:50,103

Joe?

50
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:55,483

Girls?

51
00:04:02,073 --> 00:04:03,992

( indistinct chattering )

52
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:05,660
But I feel funny 
not telling Mommy.

53
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:08,663
But if you tell Mommy, 
it won't be a surprise.

54
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:09,789

Right.

55
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:13,710

Hello, my sneaky family.

56
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:17,130
You don't give 
a dentist candy,

57
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:19,007
you don't buy a 
kitten for a veterinarian,

58
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,466

and you don't plan a

59
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,968
surprise party 
for someone like me.

60
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:23,720

Who said anyone was

61
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:25,388
planning a 
surprise party for you?

62
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,142
All right, fine. 
You tell the kids.

63
00:04:29,183 --> 00:04:30,268

They're the ones who wanted

64
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,686
to have the 
early morning meeting.

65
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:33,021
They're the 
ones that are really

66
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:34,772

fired up about your birthday.

67
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:37,400
Really? So it was 
their idea, not yours?

68
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:40,570
Hey, do I look 
like a fool to you?

69
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:44,365
You are a 
deeply disturbed man.

70
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:45,867

Thank you, darling.

71
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:48,244
Now, listen, as long as 
you know about everything,

72
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:49,537

there's a list of things

73
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,289
they say they 
need for the party.

74
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,291
I can't get 
them until Saturday.

75
00:04:53,374 --> 00:04:55,168
( chuckles ): 
You want me to buy

76
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:56,961
supplies for my 
own surprise party?

77
00:04:57,044 --> 00:04:58,588

Well, it's not like it's going

78
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:59,755

to ruin it for you.

79
00:04:59,797 --> 00:05:00,798

Well, okay, fine.

80
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:02,383

You're the one that's going

81
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:03,593

to be disappointed when all

82
00:05:03,676 --> 00:05:04,760

the good pi~atas are gone.

83
00:05:04,844 --> 00:05:06,554
So what do you 
make of that dream?

84
00:05:06,637 --> 00:05:08,097

Some guy kills his wife?

85
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,890
I don't mean to 
make you nervous,

86
00:05:09,974 --> 00:05:12,601

but that happens every day.

87
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:14,145

At the marriage counselor?

88
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:15,813

Every other day.

89
00:05:15,896 --> 00:05:17,231
With the 
therapist urging him on?

90
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:18,441

I take your point.

91
00:05:18,524 --> 00:05:20,067
I know it's not 
a realistic dream.

92
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:21,610

If that had really happened,

93
00:05:21,694 --> 00:05:23,237
it would have 
made the headlines.

94
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,738

I just can't figure out

95
00:05:24,822 --> 00:05:26,282
whether or not to 
mention it at work.

96
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:28,284

What do you mean? To the D.A.?

97
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:29,702

Why would you do that?

98
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:31,871
I don't know, I must 
have dreamt it for a reason.

99
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:32,955

Yeah, and the reason is,

100
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:34,373
the TV was on, 
and subconsciously

101
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:35,541

you were listening

102
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:37,126
to a bunch of 
lunatics who are married

103
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:38,919
talk about how they 
want to kill each other.

104
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:40,212

That's true.

105
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:41,922

Which is why the next time

106
00:05:42,006 --> 00:05:43,716
we fall asleep 
with the television on,

107
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:46,051
I'm going to make 
sure we got a little

108
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:47,886

soft-core something going on.

109
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,513

You get my meaning, woman?

110
00:05:51,932 --> 00:05:52,933

Go to work.

111
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:54,351

Oh, yeah. She heard me.

112
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:56,812

Call Maury Povich.

113
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:58,522
Tell him I'm 
ready for my close-up.

114
00:05:58,564 --> 00:06:00,649

( sighing ): Ha-ha.

115
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:07,239

( cell phone ringing )

116
00:06:07,322 --> 00:06:09,241

Detective Scanlon.

117
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:11,869
WOMAN: Scanlon? 
This is Dispatch.

118
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:13,078

What's your 20?

119
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,038
I'm at a crime 
scene in Scottsdale.

120
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:17,457
Scottsdale? That's 
not in your jurisdiction.

121
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,501
I'm having a 
difficult time copying you.

122
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:21,795
Why don't you call 
me back in 15 minutes?

123
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:27,175

( cell phone ringing )

124
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:29,803

Detective Scanlon.

125
00:06:29,886 --> 00:06:32,597
Detective Scanlon? I 
guess we were disconnected.

126
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,391
The Lieutenant 
was looking for you.

127
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:35,559

May I connect?

128
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:37,060

Absolutely. Put him through.

129
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:50,198

( cell phone ringing )

130
00:06:50,282 --> 00:06:52,033

( ringing stops )

131
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:55,495

Manny.

132
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:56,663

Thanks for coming.

133
00:06:56,705 --> 00:06:58,707

You're the best.

134
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,583
Yeah, well, I'm 
starting to think

135
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,252

that I'm the most naive.

136
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:03,586

Every one of these men wants

137
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,879

to know what I'm doing here.

138
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:06,339

Every one of these men wants

139
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:07,674
to know what 
you're doing here.

140
00:07:07,716 --> 00:07:09,592
Tell 'em to take a 
'lude. It's a crime scene.

141
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:10,802

Lee, I'm not going to

142
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:12,053

tell anyone to take anything.

143
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:14,055
And as a matter of 
fact, no, it's not.

144
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:15,348

It's not a crime scene.

145
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:17,434

Not the way you mean.

146
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:18,601

This is a murder-suicide.

147
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:20,186

This man killed his wife,

148
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,813
then he killed 
himself, and that's how

149
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:23,231

the Coroner's going to find

150
00:07:23,314 --> 00:07:25,108
and that's how the 
City's going to record it.

151
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:26,526
There's no need 
for a prosecutor,

152
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:27,902
there's no need 
for a detective.

153
00:07:27,986 --> 00:07:29,195

Particularly one who's

154
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,530

outside his

155
00:07:30,613 --> 00:07:31,906
jurisdiction 
and is on the verge

156
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,366

of being suspended.

157
00:07:34,534 --> 00:07:35,952

Manny, you ever seen this?

158
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:38,663

What?

159
00:07:38,746 --> 00:07:39,789

Bowling for Columbine.

160
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:41,082

I think so. ! Belongs to them.

161
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:42,166

They owned it.

162
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,459
It's like the 
Gone With the Wind

163
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:44,877
of gun control 
movies. Yeah? So?

164
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:46,963
So you're telling me 
a young, married couple

165
00:07:47,004 --> 00:07:48,881
whose idea of a 
hot Friday night

166
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:50,425
is watching an 
anti- NRA documentary

167
00:07:50,425 --> 00:07:51,717
keep an 
unregistered, loaded .32

168
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,553
in their 
apartment-- I don't think so.

169
00:07:53,636 --> 00:07:55,138

Someone did this.

170
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:57,056
This is like the 
other ones, Manny.

171
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,641

They're connected.

172
00:07:58,724 --> 00:07:59,976

Yeah.

173
00:08:01,018 --> 00:08:02,979
But why are you the 
only one who sees it?

174
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:07,316
You know, I've never 
really shared with anyone

175
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:08,985

who you are or what you do.

176
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:10,236

Okay.

177
00:08:10,278 --> 00:08:12,363
But I have a friend, 
he's a police detective.

178
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:13,823

He called me this morning,

179
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:15,324

wants me to go to the mayor,

180
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:16,909
get funding for a 
special task force.

181
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:18,244

What kind of task force?

182
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:20,621
For the past two years 
or so he's been obsessed

183
00:08:20,705 --> 00:08:22,623
with a string of 
deaths here in Phoenix.

184
00:08:22,665 --> 00:08:23,666

And?

185
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,418
And it's 
destroying his career.

186
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:27,336
He's ignoring 
all his other work.

187
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,838
I don't think 
his personal life

188
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:30,756
is anything to 
write home about either.

189
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,216

I don't understand...

190
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,635

He sees a crime where

191
00:08:34,718 --> 00:08:37,012
others just see 
personal turmoil.

192
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:39,431

He sees a pattern where

193
00:08:39,515 --> 00:08:41,809
others see 
only random tragedy.

194
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:43,394

He'll tell you all about it.

195
00:08:43,477 --> 00:08:45,688
He's waiting for you 
up at the crime scene.

196
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:48,607
I've asked them 
to leave the bodies

197
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:50,609

and everything else they found

198
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:52,569

exactly the way they found it.

199
00:08:52,653 --> 00:08:54,822

I was pretty vague with him.

200
00:08:54,863 --> 00:08:56,156
I told him that 
you were someone

201
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:57,616
who worked for 
me, someone I trust.

202
00:08:57,658 --> 00:08:59,326

Listen to what he has to say.

203
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,537
Look at the things 
he wants to show you.

204
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,663

Tell me what you think.

205
00:09:02,746 --> 00:09:03,747

Okay.

206
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:05,165

Thanks.

207
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:12,089

Hello?

208
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:13,423

SCANLON: Up here.

209
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:15,425

Put some booties

210
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:17,594

and gloves on first, though.

211
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:38,407
District Attorney 
Devalos asked me to stop by.

212
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:39,783

Are you his friend?

213
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:41,284

Guilty as charged.

214
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:44,329

Detective Scanlon.

215
00:09:44,412 --> 00:09:45,872

Allison. Allison Dubois.

216
00:09:45,956 --> 00:09:47,874

So what do we have here?

217
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,211
Young married 
couple found shot to death.

218
00:09:51,253 --> 00:09:53,338

Guy was 29. Girl 27.

219
00:09:53,421 --> 00:09:55,674
Coroner thinks the 
husband put a bullet

220
00:09:55,757 --> 00:09:56,883

in his wife's head, then

221
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:58,009

turned the gun on himself.

222
00:09:58,093 --> 00:09:59,469

So what do you think happened?

223
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:02,013

I don't know. Not that.

224
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:04,057

"Not that"?

225
00:10:04,099 --> 00:10:06,351
That's your 
basis for a task force?

226
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:08,311

"Not that"?

227
00:10:08,395 --> 00:10:09,896

Look, I don't know what it is

228
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,356

exactly you do with the D.A.

229
00:10:11,398 --> 00:10:12,941
I don't know what 
your specialty is.

230
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:14,442
Forensics? 
Linguistics? Criminology?

231
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:17,112
Maybe you were 
with the FBI or the CSI

232
00:10:17,195 --> 00:10:19,114

or the CIA or the kiss my ass.

233
00:10:19,406 --> 00:10:21,074

Don't misunderstand me.

234
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:22,534

I don't mean any

235
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:24,035
disrespect, but 
me, I'm just a cop.

236
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:26,454
Not a specialist. 
Started in Traffic control.

237
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,832

Glorified crossing guard.

238
00:10:28,915 --> 00:10:30,583
And I'm here to 
tell you that I could

239
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,126
look into a 
windshield 30 feet away

240
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,294

and tell you if the driver

241
00:10:33,378 --> 00:10:34,587

was going to see the stop sign

242
00:10:34,671 --> 00:10:35,880

I was holding up or if he was

243
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:37,173

going to run the intersection.

244
00:10:37,257 --> 00:10:40,134

And I was always right.

245
00:10:40,218 --> 00:10:41,928

Instinct.

246
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:44,347
It got me this 
far, so I listen to it.

247
00:10:45,723 --> 00:10:47,266

Is there anything else?

248
00:10:47,308 --> 00:10:48,726

Yeah.

249
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,813
In the past 27 months, 
there have been three cases

250
00:10:51,896 --> 00:10:53,064

in the Greater Phoenix area

251
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:54,273

of supposed murder-suicides

252
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,442
among couples married 
little more than a year.

253
00:10:56,526 --> 00:10:58,694
Well, they do say the 
first year's the hardest.

254
00:10:58,736 --> 00:11:00,780

I wouldn't know.

255
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,740

But what I do know is, in the

256
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:04,617

90-some years prior to that,

257
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,702
in fact for as long 
as they kept records,

258
00:11:06,744 --> 00:11:08,246

there wasn't one other case

259
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:09,747

thought to be murder-suicide

260
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,499

among couples married more

261
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,125
than one year 
but less than two.

262
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:15,294

Not one.

263
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:17,088
Well, these are 
complicated times.

264
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:19,507
Phoenix is a bigger 
than it's ever been before.

265
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:20,841

People get married,

266
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:22,510
there are bound to 
be disappointments,

267
00:11:22,593 --> 00:11:23,928

temptations...

268
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:25,554

( sighs )

269
00:11:25,638 --> 00:11:28,724

The first couple...

270
00:11:28,724 --> 00:11:30,851

was my sister and her husband.

271
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:35,731

I'm sorry.

272
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:36,941

He would've killed for her.

273
00:11:37,024 --> 00:11:38,150

She would've killed for him.

274
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:39,693
There's nothing 
complicated about it.

275
00:11:39,777 --> 00:11:41,821
They didn't do 
it to each other.

276
00:11:41,904 --> 00:11:43,823

Someone did it to them.

277
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:45,533

Same thing here.

278
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:47,701
So, how do you 
want to do this?

279
00:11:47,785 --> 00:11:49,453

Do you want to wait outside,

280
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:51,080

or-or should I call you or...?

281
00:11:51,163 --> 00:11:52,414

What do you mean?

282
00:11:52,498 --> 00:11:54,792
I need to be alone, 
so I can concentrate.

283
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,211

Oh.

284
00:11:57,294 --> 00:11:59,546

All right.

285
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:02,216

All right.

286
00:12:29,326 --> 00:12:32,788

( eerie breathing sound )

287
00:12:32,871 --> 00:12:34,498

Nice to see you again.

288
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,421
They did a wonderful 
job, don't you think?

289
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:46,009

Really rose to the occasion.

290
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:50,138
Actually, I don't 
know what to think.

291
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:51,139

Who are you?

292
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,142

Are you dead, too?

293
00:12:54,184 --> 00:12:58,813

Me? No. I'm... no one.

294
00:12:58,897 --> 00:13:01,942

I'm not even a real person.

295
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:05,028
I'm just energy left 
behind by the two of them.

296
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:08,281
A way for them to 
communicate with you.

297
00:13:08,281 --> 00:13:10,325
Through your 
dreams last night.

298
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:11,409

Here, now.

299
00:13:13,536 --> 00:13:15,789
They'd speak 
to you themselves,

300
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,707
but their souls 
are still in shock.

301
00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:19,376

Both their souls.

302
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:22,545

You see, this happened

303
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:25,632
not because onwas 
angry with the other.

304
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:29,260
This happened 
because each loved the other

305
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:32,222

more than life itself.

306
00:13:32,263 --> 00:13:36,809
It's important to 
them you understand this.

307
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:02,835

( gasps )

308
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:13,262

( groans )

309
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:38,120

A third person?

310
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:39,246

And you're cerin of this?

311
00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:40,664

Can I tell you who it is? No.

312
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:42,917
Can I tell you what 
they were doing there? Uh-uh.

313
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,002
Can I tell you why 
all this happened? No.

314
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,838
Not yet. But I do 
agree with Detective Scanlon.

315
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:49,048

This is not something

316
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,674
that these two 
people did to each other.

317
00:14:50,716 --> 00:14:53,010
This is something 
that was done to them.

318
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,094

( slapping desk )

319
00:14:54,178 --> 00:14:56,222
I knew it, I 
knew it, I knew it!

320
00:14:59,683 --> 00:15:01,602
Thank you, 
thank you, thank you.

321
00:15:04,188 --> 00:15:05,606

So what'd you pick up? A

322
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:06,940

third set of fingerprints?

323
00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:11,195

A hair sample?

324
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:15,365
Maybe there was 
something about the wounds?

325
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:16,450

Lee...

326
00:15:18,827 --> 00:15:21,789
Allison 
specializes in a more...

327
00:15:21,872 --> 00:15:24,166
unconventional 
branch of criminology.

328
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,962
Okay. So what is 
it convinced you?

329
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:30,631

Some kind of evidence, right?

330
00:15:30,672 --> 00:15:33,383
Something Manny here can 
take into a court of law?

331
00:15:33,425 --> 00:15:35,886
Something he can use 
to... persuade the mayor

332
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:37,262

to fund a task force,

333
00:15:37,346 --> 00:15:39,348
get some manpower and 
some resources on this case?

334
00:15:46,396 --> 00:15:47,647

( clears throat )

335
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:48,940

I had a dream the other night.

336
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,073

Oh, crap.

337
00:15:57,115 --> 00:15:58,158

Shoot me now.

338
00:15:58,366 --> 00:16:00,202
She's not a 
criminologist at all, is she?

339
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:01,536

Allison is an extraordinarily

340
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:02,746

sensitive and intuitive person

341
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,039

who I've worked with to great

342
00:16:04,122 --> 00:16:05,290

effect on a number of cases.

343
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:06,791

Do I have the word "jackass"

344
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,293

stenciled across my forehead?!

345
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:09,920
All right, you 
need to lower you voice.

346
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:10,962

Oh, my God!

347
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:12,505

Did you hear what I said?

348
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:13,965
What do I look 
like to you, Manny?

349
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:15,759
She's one of those 
sob-sister fortunetellers

350
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,177
that crawls out 
from under a rock

351
00:16:17,218 --> 00:16:18,637
when you can't 
find the missing kid

352
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:19,888

and it's been over a year

353
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:21,431
and the parents 
are getting desperate

354
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:22,515

and they'll listen

355
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:23,892
to just about 
anyone, isn't she?

356
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,352
Point in fact, 
up until recently,

357
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:27,562
Mrs. Dubois was a very 
accomplished law student...

358
00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:29,022

What were you thinking?

359
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:31,107
How the hell is she 
going to get me a task force?!

360
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:32,150

What are you going to do?

361
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:33,234

Walk up to the mayor

362
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:34,486

and tell him she had a dream?

363
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,779

No, seriously. Answer me that.

364
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,656
How is putting me 
together with Milli Vanilli

365
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,117
the Psychic here 
gonna get me a task force?

366
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,786
You're right. That 
was never gonna happen.

367
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,040
Would you mind telling 
me just what was the point?

368
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:48,708
The point-- 
assuming she agreed with you

369
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,959

that there was

370
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,294
something 
worth investigating--

371
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,504
was that Mrs. 
Dubois is your task force.

372
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:54,964
That's it. She's 
all the resources

373
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:56,549
anyone is ever 
gonna give you, period.

374
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:57,759

Oh, boy, you really

375
00:16:57,842 --> 00:16:59,385
know how to make 
a girl feel special.

376
00:16:59,469 --> 00:17:00,803

You're insane.

377
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,388

And you're insaner.

378
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:04,932

And you do have the word "ass"

379
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:06,851
tattooed on your 
fehead except it doesn't have

380
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:09,520

a "jack" in front of it!

381
00:17:09,604 --> 00:17:10,813

Don't you want to know

382
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,064

about the other three cases?

383
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:14,484
Seeing as how I seem 
to be the only person

384
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,027

on the planet who agrees

385
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,487

with you even a little bit?

386
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,654

Wouldn't you want to know

387
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:19,780

if I see any similarities?

388
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:21,657
I don't know what's 
she talking about, Manny.

389
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:22,825

I don't have three other

390
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,035

crime scenes to take her to.

391
00:17:24,118 --> 00:17:26,370
Give her a set of 
the crime scene photos.

392
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:28,080

Will that do it?

393
00:17:28,164 --> 00:17:30,625

Well, it's a start.

394
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:38,299

She's here!

395
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:40,760
Daddy, she's here! 
I'll watch the baby.

396
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:44,221

Whew!

397
00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:47,850

( rapping on glass )

398
00:17:48,976 --> 00:17:51,061

You just aged me by ten years.

399
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,897
And that would 
make you a whopping 38.

400
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,191

Very nice. Good recovery.

401
00:17:55,232 --> 00:17:56,525

I think I'll keep ya.

402
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:58,444
So, listen, so when 
you walk through that door,

403
00:17:58,485 --> 00:17:59,987
the kids are going 
to be all over you.

404
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:02,281
I told them I 
needed them to distract you

405
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:03,824
so I could sneak 
all the party stuff

406
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:05,200
out of my car 
and into the house.

407
00:18:05,242 --> 00:18:06,493

Out of your car.

408
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:07,578

Yeah.

409
00:18:07,661 --> 00:18:09,913
Of course, 
because you bought it

410
00:18:09,997 --> 00:18:14,043
because you are 
superdaddy and a superhusband

411
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,961
trying to pull off a 
supersurpise party for...

412
00:18:16,003 --> 00:18:18,797

For my 28-year-old wife.

413
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:22,760
You're really 
pushing your luck.

414
00:18:33,187 --> 00:18:34,229

Wow,

415
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:35,772

the things you won't do

416
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,275
to try and spice 
up our love life.

417
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,359

I don't know about you,

418
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:40,611

but this does nothing for me.

419
00:18:40,736 --> 00:18:42,779
It's not funny. These 
people are really dead.

420
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:44,740

Boy, as you get older,

421
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:46,241
approaching your 
30s and everything,

422
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,534

you're really starting to

423
00:18:47,617 --> 00:18:48,744

lose your sense of humor.

424
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,579
You know, you've 
gotten every bit of mileage

425
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,039

you can out of that joke.

426
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:53,457

Someone's in a good mood.

427
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,375
The more I look 
at these pictures,

428
00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:57,669
the less sense 
everything makes.

429
00:18:57,753 --> 00:18:59,212

( yawning )

430
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:01,006

So, why don't you tell Devalos

431
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:03,091
to take you off 
whatever this is?

432
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,302
Tell him you're 
not getting anything.

433
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:06,720

Well, that's just it. I am.

434
00:19:06,803 --> 00:19:09,514
It's just what I'm 
getting doesn't add up.

435
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:10,849

And it's not just Devalos.

436
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:12,601
There's this 
cop. This detective.

437
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,477

You should have heard him

438
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:16,229

talking about his instincts.

439
00:19:16,313 --> 00:19:19,065
Suddenly when it 
became about my instincts,

440
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:20,859

about him working with me?

441
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:23,153

Well, that would be insane.

442
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:24,946

I must be insane.

443
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,823
Well, then, this 
is perfect, isn't it?

444
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:28,033

You don't like him.

445
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:29,451
Sounds like he 
doesn't like you.

446
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:31,202
The things you're 
sensing about this case

447
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:32,662

aren't clarifying anything.

448
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:36,332
All great reasons to 
respectfully remove yourself.

449
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:41,880
Hmm. Well, I 
might just do that.

450
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:43,548

I might just do that.

451
00:19:43,631 --> 00:19:45,842
Good. I'm glad I 
could be of help.

452
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:10,324

( alarm clock beeping )

453
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:11,784

( groans )

454
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:14,454

That makes no sense.

455
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:16,664
I'm just 
telling you what I saw.

456
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:17,748

What you dreamt.

457
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,917

What I saw in my dreams.

458
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:21,836
Help me out 
here, will you, Manny?

459
00:20:21,878 --> 00:20:24,172
All right, let me see 
if I can understand this.

460
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:25,715

You would see their faces...

461
00:20:25,756 --> 00:20:27,091

They came to me in

462
00:20:27,174 --> 00:20:28,509
flashes, like 
crime scene photos.

463
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:29,594

Right. But always

464
00:20:29,677 --> 00:20:30,886

the husband first.

465
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,138

Yes.

466
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:33,681
And always having 
already been shot.

467
00:20:33,764 --> 00:20:34,765

And that makes you think

468
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:36,017

that the husbands died first?

469
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,686
Allison, the 
husband was always found

470
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:40,021

at the crime scene

471
00:20:40,104 --> 00:20:41,480

with the gun in his hand

472
00:20:41,564 --> 00:20:43,190
covered with 
blowback and powder residue.

473
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:44,567

You can't kill yourself first

474
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,027

and then kill your wife.

475
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,111

Thank you.

476
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:48,195

Excuse me.

477
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,488

Could you remind the detective

478
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:50,823

that I am on his side?

479
00:20:50,906 --> 00:20:52,783
It's all right. Tell 
her I appreciate the help.

480
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:54,201

But I would really prefer it

481
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:55,911
if her theories 
made a little more sense.

482
00:20:55,995 --> 00:20:56,996

Excuse me?

483
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,456
But with all 
due respect, ma'am,

484
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,916

all you do is come up

485
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:02,001

with things that

486
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:03,419
contradict the 
physical evidence.

487
00:21:03,502 --> 00:21:04,753
That kind of 
help I don't need.

488
00:21:04,837 --> 00:21:06,380
At least I have a 
theory. What's yours?

489
00:21:06,463 --> 00:21:07,631

You've been on this two years

490
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:08,966
and what have 
you come up with?

491
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:11,010
"My sister's 
husband wouldn't do that."

492
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:12,594
Frankly, I'm not 
impressed. Allison...

493
00:21:12,678 --> 00:21:13,679

Golly, ma'am. Not

494
00:21:13,762 --> 00:21:15,055
impressing you? 
I can't tell you

495
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:16,307

how upsetting that is.

496
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,725
I'll probably 
be awake all night.

497
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:19,977
Lee, would you 
give it a rest, please?

498
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,021

( intercom ringing )

499
00:21:22,104 --> 00:21:24,231

I told you not now!

500
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:25,315

( sighing )

501
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:26,900
Well, I guess 
this was a bad idea.

502
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:29,194

You two are clearly not

503
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:31,405

meant to work with each other.

504
00:21:31,488 --> 00:21:32,489

Allison, I appreciate

505
00:21:32,573 --> 00:21:33,574

your time and effort,

506
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:35,784
and I 
apologize for my friend's

507
00:21:35,868 --> 00:21:37,911
extraordinary 
lack of gratitude.

508
00:21:37,995 --> 00:21:39,538

Lee, I hope I can count on you

509
00:21:39,621 --> 00:21:41,123

not to say anything to anyone

510
00:21:41,206 --> 00:21:42,624

about who Allison is

511
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,834

and how we u her talents

512
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:44,960

here in the D.A.'s office.

513
00:21:45,043 --> 00:21:46,336

You're kidding, right?

514
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,255
Is there anything else 
you would like to share

515
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:49,464

before I put this

516
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:51,049
investigation to 
bed once and for all?

517
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:52,134

No.

518
00:21:52,217 --> 00:21:54,344

We're done.

519
00:21:54,428 --> 00:21:56,555

Yes, there's one thing.

520
00:21:56,638 --> 00:21:57,681

Like I suspected,

521
00:21:57,764 --> 00:21:59,349
when I looked at 
the crime photos,

522
00:21:59,433 --> 00:22:00,934

I always saw three people

523
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:02,436

at every one of the killings.

524
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:04,813

Except for...

525
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:06,982

this one.

526
00:22:08,608 --> 00:22:10,443

This one had four people.

527
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:11,528

Oh, four now? Well, the

528
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:12,779
killer bring a 
friend with him?

529
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:14,447

Damn it, Lee!

530
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:16,366

Hey, Task Force,

531
00:22:16,449 --> 00:22:17,868

you got any idea

532
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:19,953
what any of these people 
actually might look like?

533
00:22:19,995 --> 00:22:21,746
I mean, that would 
give us a real leg up.

534
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,081
Are they male? 
Are they female?

535
00:22:23,123 --> 00:22:24,583

It doesn't work like that.

536
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,376

I don't see them. I feel them.

537
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:29,421
Oh, well, okay, so does 
it feel like an Anglo guy

538
00:22:29,504 --> 00:22:31,047

or a Latin guy? Is he black?

539
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:32,716
Or maybe he's got 
kind of an Asian feel?

540
00:22:32,757 --> 00:22:34,050

Wow, she's right.

541
00:22:34,134 --> 00:22:35,301

You are an ass.

542
00:22:35,385 --> 00:22:37,679
Thanks for that 
vote of confidence.

543
00:22:37,762 --> 00:22:39,013

Yeah, and as far

544
00:22:39,097 --> 00:22:40,682
as this not being 
what it appears to be?

545
00:22:40,724 --> 00:22:42,016
Well, there's 
an old expression:

546
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:43,893
If it walks like a 
duck and talks like a duck,

547
00:22:43,935 --> 00:22:45,854

then it is a duck.

548
00:22:45,937 --> 00:22:47,730
Personally, I think 
you're up to your knees

549
00:22:47,814 --> 00:22:49,023

in a duck pond, Detective.

550
00:22:49,107 --> 00:22:50,900
rdon me, um, Mr. 
District Attorney,

551
00:22:50,984 --> 00:22:52,610
The Third 
Precinct keeps calling,

552
00:22:52,694 --> 00:22:53,736

and they were wondering if

553
00:22:53,778 --> 00:22:54,779

you could run down there.

554
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:56,614
Apparently, they have 
some kind of situation.

555
00:22:56,656 --> 00:22:59,033
All right. Tell 
them I'm on my way.

556
00:22:59,117 --> 00:23:01,578

Allison, Detective Scanlon.

557
00:23:05,873 --> 00:23:07,250

Idiot.

558
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:08,710
Sorry to make 
you come across town,

559
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:10,378
but the chief 
wanted to cut you in early.

560
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,255

Cut me in early on what?

561
00:23:12,338 --> 00:23:14,298
Our guys were called 
to a homicide last night

562
00:23:14,382 --> 00:23:15,591

and they brought this guy in,

563
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:17,552
but nobody can 
quite get a fix on whether

564
00:23:17,635 --> 00:23:18,886
he's the 
victim or perpetrator.

565
00:23:18,928 --> 00:23:21,264
And he's like, "I'm 
doing an experiment.

566
00:23:21,347 --> 00:23:22,682

A social experiment."

567
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:24,725
And he's standing 
there in my house;

568
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:26,102

ski mask, you know?

569
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:27,937
He's about my height, 
I think. I don't know.

570
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:29,647
And he's pointing a 
gun at me and my wife.

571
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:30,690

And I'm like...

572
00:23:30,773 --> 00:23:32,316
"experiment"? What 
kind of experiment?"

573
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,484

And I'm talking, you know?

574
00:23:33,568 --> 00:23:35,027
'Cause I'm 
thinking. Talking is good.

575
00:23:35,111 --> 00:23:36,779
Talking is better 
than dying, you know?

576
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:38,072

And he's like, "You love her?"

577
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:39,532

He's pointing at my wife.

578
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:41,534
I'm like, "Of course I 
love her. She's my wife!"

579
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:42,952
He goes, "Okay, 
here's the deal.

580
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:45,579
You shoot her and 
we'll let you live."

581
00:23:45,663 --> 00:23:49,041
And I'm like, "What?! 
Are you... are you insane?"

582
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,419
He's like, "No, 
I'm a social scientist,

583
00:23:51,502 --> 00:23:52,503

you bourgeois A-hole!"

584
00:23:52,586 --> 00:23:54,130
And he takes his 
gun and he puts it

585
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:55,673

right under my chin, right

586
00:23:55,756 --> 00:23:57,133
here, and he 
goes, "Okay, lab rat,

587
00:23:57,216 --> 00:24:00,302
"you shoot her or 
I'll shoot you both.

588
00:24:00,386 --> 00:24:02,388
Make a choice. You 
wanna live? You wanna live?"

589
00:24:02,471 --> 00:24:04,140
And I'm like, "Yeah, 
of course! Of course!

590
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:05,391

And he goes, "Okay, so do it.

591
00:24:05,432 --> 00:24:07,476

Choose life! Shoot her!"

592
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,853
And she's wailing, 
you know? She's screaming,

593
00:24:09,937 --> 00:24:11,105

and you can't even make

594
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:12,314

out what she's saying, even.

595
00:24:12,356 --> 00:24:13,732
And for a 
second, like, I almost

596
00:24:13,816 --> 00:24:15,192
thought she 
was saying, "Do it.

597
00:24:15,276 --> 00:24:17,820
And I'm thinking, 
"Do it? Shoot my wife?"

598
00:24:17,903 --> 00:24:21,407
I can't! I can't do 
that. I can't do that!

599
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,450

And then, and then the gun

600
00:24:23,534 --> 00:24:25,452

was... the gun was so light...

601
00:24:25,536 --> 00:24:26,912

the gun was so...

602
00:24:26,995 --> 00:24:28,872
And then I'm 
thinking, "Oh, I see,

603
00:24:28,956 --> 00:24:29,998

"I get it. It's a joke.

604
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:31,959
It's a freakin' 
joke," you know?

605
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:33,419
And he's got 
his gun right here

606
00:24:33,502 --> 00:24:34,837
and she's 
wailing, so I did it.

607
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,421

I pulled the trigger.

608
00:24:36,505 --> 00:24:38,048

Mr. Conrad,

609
00:24:38,132 --> 00:24:39,633

so am I to understand

610
00:24:39,716 --> 00:24:42,886
that you're now 
admitting to what happened?

611
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,972
Admitting that you 
did kill your wife?

612
00:24:45,055 --> 00:24:46,890

No. No.

613
00:24:46,974 --> 00:24:48,475

It's like I said before.

614
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,018

I did pull the trigger,

615
00:24:50,102 --> 00:24:53,647
but nothing happened. 
It went "chik". Nothing.

616
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,815

It's an empty gun.

617
00:24:54,898 --> 00:24:56,191

And that guy laughed.

618
00:24:56,275 --> 00:25:03,907
And he goes, "You're 
the first one to ever do it.

619
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,993
"You're the first 
one I've ever met.

620
00:25:07,077 --> 00:25:09,121

Congratulations."

621
00:25:09,204 --> 00:25:12,749
And then he just 
stood behind me, holding me

622
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:15,127
and sudden I 
felt his gun leave

623
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,420
my chin and ( 
mimics gunshot ).

624
00:25:17,504 --> 00:25:19,256

He shot her.

625
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:21,216

( mimics gunshot )

626
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:27,180
And I could 
feel... I could feel her...

627
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:29,099

her blood, I guess.

628
00:25:29,182 --> 00:25:37,565
Skin and stuff hit me in 
the face... in the chest.

629
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:41,277

And then he just... handed

630
00:25:41,361 --> 00:25:44,948

me the gun, the real gun...

631
00:25:45,031 --> 00:25:46,908

and he left.

632
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:57,001

So what do you make of that?

633
00:25:58,086 --> 00:25:59,879

Yeah, track down Lee Scanlon.

634
00:25:59,963 --> 00:26:01,297

Ask him to come down to

635
00:26:01,381 --> 00:26:02,549

the Third Precct right away.

636
00:26:02,632 --> 00:26:05,051
Ask Allison to 
come along, too.

637
00:26:05,134 --> 00:26:06,469

Okay.

638
00:26:07,637 --> 00:26:08,805

DEVALOS: And do you have any

639
00:26:08,888 --> 00:26:10,014

idea how this mysterious man

640
00:26:10,264 --> 00:26:11,474

in a ski mask gained entry

641
00:26:11,557 --> 00:26:12,809

to your home, Mr. Conrad?

642
00:26:12,892 --> 00:26:15,770

No. I have no idea.

643
00:26:15,812 --> 00:26:18,606
I came home from 
work, I walked in the door,

644
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,192
and there he was, a 
gun to my wife's head,

645
00:26:21,234 --> 00:26:23,736
talking about how he's 
this social scientist guy

646
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,404
and how we've 
been specially chosen

647
00:26:25,488 --> 00:26:27,198

to be part of his experiment.

648
00:26:27,198 --> 00:26:28,783
So let me ask 
you this question.

649
00:26:28,866 --> 00:26:30,576

Why do you think a killer

650
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,245
would go 
through all the trouble

651
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:34,705
to find a way to 
discreetly enter your home,

652
00:26:34,747 --> 00:26:36,707

confront you and your wife,

653
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:38,125

kill your wife

654
00:26:38,209 --> 00:26:40,419
in cold blood 
right in front of you

655
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:42,463

and then let you live?

656
00:26:42,505 --> 00:26:44,674
Don't you 
think he'd worry that

657
00:26:44,757 --> 00:26:46,550
you'd do the very 
thing you're doing now?

658
00:26:46,592 --> 00:26:48,010

Describe what happened,

659
00:26:48,094 --> 00:26:49,345

describe him to the police?

660
00:26:49,428 --> 00:26:50,596

Why would he do that?

661
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:56,560

I... I don't know.

662
00:26:58,354 --> 00:27:00,356

You think I did it, don't you?

663
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:01,941

I didn't say that, sir.

664
00:27:02,024 --> 00:27:03,359

Well, you don't have to be a

665
00:27:03,442 --> 00:27:04,735

mind reader to figure it out!

666
00:27:04,777 --> 00:27:06,737

I guess because I did it.

667
00:27:06,821 --> 00:27:08,864
He told me he'd let 
me live if I did it,

668
00:27:08,948 --> 00:27:10,407

and then I did it.

669
00:27:10,491 --> 00:27:13,077
( sniffling ): I 
mean not really, but...

670
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,579

I showed him that I could...

671
00:27:15,663 --> 00:27:17,581

that I would.

672
00:27:17,665 --> 00:27:19,041

I mean, think about it.

673
00:27:19,124 --> 00:27:20,626

I know it sounds crazy.

674
00:27:20,668 --> 00:27:21,961

I mean, it is crazy!

675
00:27:22,002 --> 00:27:24,046

But maybe it's not that crazy.

676
00:27:24,088 --> 00:27:25,297

I mean, here I am,

677
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:26,966
telling you 
about what happened,

678
00:27:27,007 --> 00:27:29,093
and you're thinking 
I'm crazy or I'm lying.

679
00:27:29,176 --> 00:27:31,345
Which is what he 
wants you to think, right?

680
00:27:31,387 --> 00:27:34,014

So, actually if you think

681
00:27:34,098 --> 00:27:36,642

about it, it's not that crazy.

682
00:27:36,642 --> 00:27:38,644

In fact, that's pretty smart.

683
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,605

Right?

684
00:27:48,362 --> 00:27:50,447
He's heading over 
to the crime scene.

685
00:27:50,531 --> 00:27:53,325
He asked me to ask you 
if you'd like to go along.

686
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,495
So I hear you 
wanted some company.

687
00:27:59,623 --> 00:28:01,541
Did someone have 
a change of heart?

688
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:04,086

Nah. Same old heart.

689
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:05,629
Remember 
yesterday when you said

690
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:07,589
you thought there 
were four people there

691
00:28:07,673 --> 00:28:10,759
when my sister 
and her husband...

692
00:28:10,842 --> 00:28:13,345
Didn't make 
sense to me at first...

693
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:15,972

then I remembered.

694
00:28:16,098 --> 00:28:17,766

My sister was three-and-a-half

695
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:19,392

months pregnant when she died.

696
00:28:22,103 --> 00:28:24,356

Hey, Joe, this is Bill.

697
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:26,525
Gosh, I hope I'm 
calling the right number.

698
00:28:26,608 --> 00:28:28,193

Uh, listen,

699
00:28:28,235 --> 00:28:29,819

Jenny and I would love to

700
00:28:29,903 --> 00:28:31,404

come to the surprise party.

701
00:28:31,488 --> 00:28:33,114

We both remember meeting

702
00:28:33,198 --> 00:28:34,699
Allison at the 
company Christmas party

703
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:36,034

and we've been meaning to

704
00:28:36,117 --> 00:28:37,452
call and get 
together ever since,

705
00:28:37,535 --> 00:28:38,912
so this is, uh, 
this is perfect.

706
00:28:38,995 --> 00:28:40,580

Anyway, count us in.

707
00:28:40,664 --> 00:28:42,957

Uh... Friday night.

708
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:44,668

Your house. 8:00.

709
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:46,086

See ya.

710
00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:48,630

That was great.

711
00:28:48,713 --> 00:28:49,964

It's incredible.

712
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,884
Thanks. And, uh, 
I can count on you?

713
00:28:52,926 --> 00:28:54,594

Mm-hmm.

714
00:28:54,677 --> 00:28:56,638

Two tickets. "Our Town".

715
00:28:56,721 --> 00:28:58,598

At the Church. Starring you.

716
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,308

Break a leg.

717
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:12,153

How does this work?

718
00:29:12,236 --> 00:29:13,905

I don't know.

719
00:29:13,947 --> 00:29:15,698
Whoever made 
me this way forgot

720
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,367
to give me an 
instruction book.

721
00:29:20,662 --> 00:29:21,996

I like those.

722
00:30:05,414 --> 00:30:07,374

Could you stop doing that?

723
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,670

Stop what?

724
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:19,094

I think I need some fresh air.

725
00:30:34,818 --> 00:30:36,195

You feeling any better?

726
00:30:38,364 --> 00:30:40,699
You seen many dead 
people in your life?

727
00:30:42,242 --> 00:30:44,411

The reason I ask is, I've

728
00:30:44,495 --> 00:30:46,538

actually seen quite a few.

729
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,462
It's funny you 
come to a crime scene,

730
00:30:53,545 --> 00:30:54,755

you see them laying there,

731
00:30:54,838 --> 00:30:56,673
the first place 
you look is their eyes.

732
00:30:59,218 --> 00:31:02,679
You know better, but 
it's just... natural.

733
00:31:02,721 --> 00:31:04,014

You want to believe there's

734
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:05,223

some kind of answer there,

735
00:31:05,349 --> 00:31:07,017

but there's nothing.

736
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:12,022
For me anyway, 
but... not for you, huh?

737
00:31:13,774 --> 00:31:16,777
There were 
flashes, like from a camera.

738
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,820
And you know 
what else is strange?

739
00:31:18,862 --> 00:31:20,989

The other night, I... I

740
00:31:21,073 --> 00:31:23,116
dreamt in 
pictures... photographs.

741
00:31:23,241 --> 00:31:25,952
I mean, have to 
keep reminding myself

742
00:31:25,994 --> 00:31:27,204

that we're looking for a

743
00:31:27,287 --> 00:31:28,455

killer, not a photographer

744
00:31:28,497 --> 00:31:30,248

Excuse me. I'll be right back.

745
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:48,933

Planning a wedding?

746
00:31:49,017 --> 00:31:50,769

Shopping for a photographer?

747
00:31:50,852 --> 00:31:52,687

I don't know.

748
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,651

SCANLON: Just an instinct.

749
00:31:58,693 --> 00:32:00,111

( Bridgette screaming )

750
00:32:00,195 --> 00:32:02,155
Bridgette! If you don't 
let me brush those knots

751
00:32:02,197 --> 00:32:03,531

out of your hair, we're

752
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:04,949
going to have 
to chop it all off!

753
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:06,910
Don't let her 
chop my head off!

754
00:32:06,993 --> 00:32:08,411

JOE: Chop your head off?

755
00:32:08,495 --> 00:32:10,371
Aw, you bringing your 
work home with you again?

756
00:32:10,413 --> 00:32:11,539

Let me at her!

757
00:32:11,623 --> 00:32:14,834

Um, can I make a suggestion?

758
00:32:14,918 --> 00:32:16,711
Why don't we 
call in an expert.

759
00:32:16,794 --> 00:32:18,838
Somebody with 
beautifully maintained hair,

760
00:32:18,922 --> 00:32:20,381

who also knows a thing or

761
00:32:20,465 --> 00:32:21,758

two about dealing with kids.

762
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:23,551

Hmm...

763
00:32:23,635 --> 00:32:24,886

Ariel!

764
00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:26,637

Oh, no!

765
00:32:26,721 --> 00:32:28,348

( chuckling )

766
00:32:28,431 --> 00:32:29,682

Or you can do it yourself.

767
00:32:31,184 --> 00:32:33,936

Foiled again!

768
00:32:37,064 --> 00:32:38,524

Ow!

769
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:41,777

Wow. You one of those people

770
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:43,404

who can talk out their ass?

771
00:32:43,488 --> 00:32:44,489

It's not funny.

772
00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:45,490

Kind of funny.

773
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,283

Great. We have a message.

774
00:32:47,325 --> 00:32:48,326

( phone beeps )

775
00:32:48,326 --> 00:32:50,119

( sharp exhale )

776
00:32:50,161 --> 00:32:52,079

Hey, it's Bill...

777
00:32:52,163 --> 00:32:53,789

Hmm, nice. It's someone

778
00:32:53,873 --> 00:32:55,458

named Bill from your office.

779
00:32:55,499 --> 00:33:00,338
Hmm. He's calling to 
RSVP for my surprise party!

780
00:33:00,421 --> 00:33:01,547

Cool.

781
00:33:01,589 --> 00:33:03,507
You're actually 
very good at this.

782
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:05,384
You're quite the 
little the party planner

783
00:33:05,426 --> 00:33:07,261

and quite the surpriser.

784
00:33:07,344 --> 00:33:10,431
Hey, you don't buy 
candy for a dentist,

785
00:33:10,473 --> 00:33:13,184
you don't give 
a kitten to a vet,

786
00:33:13,267 --> 00:33:14,435

and you don't waste time

787
00:33:14,518 --> 00:33:15,603

trying to surprise someone

788
00:33:15,686 --> 00:33:17,188
who's always one 
step ahead of you

789
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:19,565

8:00. Hmm.

790
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:21,734

Tomorrow.

791
00:33:21,817 --> 00:33:24,403

Friday night at your house...

792
00:33:24,445 --> 00:33:25,738

Here?

793
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:26,780

( phone beeps )

794
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,324

You invited everyone here?

795
00:33:28,365 --> 00:33:29,867

Well, yeah. Why not?

796
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,035

Well, for one thing, who

797
00:33:31,118 --> 00:33:32,161

are you gonna get to clean

798
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:33,621

all day tomorrow so you'll

799
00:33:33,662 --> 00:33:34,955

be ready to have this party?

800
00:33:36,624 --> 00:33:37,875

You're joking.

801
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,710
Well, I mean as long 
as you're not working.

802
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:42,463

It's... it's my party!

803
00:33:42,546 --> 00:33:45,632
It's supposed to be 
for me! It's my birthday!

804
00:33:45,674 --> 00:33:47,092
That's all the 
more incentive to...

805
00:33:47,134 --> 00:33:48,719

( phone ringing )

806
00:33:48,802 --> 00:33:50,179

Aren't you going to get that?

807
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:52,848
Why? It's one of the 
wicked stepsisters calling

808
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:55,058
to say she's 
coming to the ball,

809
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:57,519
but she wants me to 
stop and clean her fireplace.

810
00:33:57,603 --> 00:33:59,521

Hello?

811
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:00,856

Yes.

812
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,274

For you.

813
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:04,610

Hello.

814
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:06,862

Yes, Detective Scanlon?

815
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:08,739
Sorry to be 
calling your house so late,

816
00:34:08,822 --> 00:34:11,074
but you want to hear an 
interesting coincidence?

817
00:34:11,158 --> 00:34:13,076
The man who 
photographed Conrad's wedding

818
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,703
also 
photographed Tim and Donna's.

819
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,955

Wow.

820
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:18,457

And my sister's.

821
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,293
SCANLON: Feeling like 
paying him a visit tomorrow?

822
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:23,545

Work.

823
00:34:23,587 --> 00:34:24,880

Tomorrow.

824
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:26,047

Hmm.

825
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:29,509

Absolutely.

826
00:34:29,551 --> 00:34:34,598
As long as I'm 
home before 8:00.

827
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:35,849

Okay. Thank you.

828
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:36,892

( phone beeps )

829
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,311

( pounding on door )

830
00:34:39,352 --> 00:34:40,687

SCANLON: Mr. Rondell?

831
00:34:40,729 --> 00:34:42,063

This is the Phoenix

832
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:43,440
Police. I have 
a search warrant.

833
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,442
You want to open 
up and let us in?

834
00:34:48,528 --> 00:34:49,529

( thudding )

835
00:34:49,613 --> 00:34:50,739

( yells )

836
00:34:52,615 --> 00:34:55,910

Go, go, go, go!

837
00:35:00,248 --> 00:35:03,334

It's clear, it's all clear!

838
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:08,506
( voices over 
police dispatch )

839
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,503
Any idea how your 
sister found this guy?

840
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:00,850
She really doesn't want 
you to see her like this.

841
00:36:05,104 --> 00:36:06,355

OFFICER: Detective?

842
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:08,024

Mr. District Attorney?

843
00:36:11,986 --> 00:36:14,405
Look at the files he 
kept on these people.

844
00:36:14,488 --> 00:36:16,449

My God.

845
00:36:17,533 --> 00:36:19,326
What? First he'd 
photograph their weddings,

846
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,537
then it's... 
like he owned them.

847
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,873
He studied them. They 
were his test subjects.

848
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:25,624
There's gotta be 
hundreds of contact sheets

849
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:27,126
of this couple's 
comings and goings.

850
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:29,086
They didn't even know 
th were being watched.

851
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,547
Going to work, 
getting the mail,

852
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,048

birthday parties...

853
00:36:33,173 --> 00:36:34,633

Death.

854
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,177
He'd give them a year 
of marriage, and then...

855
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:39,763
just after their 
first anniversaries...

856
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:42,016
I think you need 
to look at these.

857
00:36:48,397 --> 00:36:51,483
These must be 
works in progress.

858
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:53,736

We've got wedding photos,

859
00:36:53,819 --> 00:36:55,904

some surveillance, but no...

860
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:57,739

I wonder who's next.

861
00:37:02,202 --> 00:37:03,996

This couple. Tonight.

862
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:08,083
How in the hell 
do you know that?

863
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:11,044

Your sister told me.

864
00:37:11,795 --> 00:37:13,880

( sniffling )

865
00:37:13,964 --> 00:37:16,091

( sobbing )

866
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:23,140

Welcome home.

867
00:37:23,223 --> 00:37:25,267

We've been waiting for you.

868
00:37:29,396 --> 00:37:31,273
Close the door, 
please, and step

869
00:37:31,356 --> 00:37:33,191
into the room, 
where we can see you?

870
00:37:35,068 --> 00:37:36,570

Thank you.

871
00:37:36,695 --> 00:37:38,238

We're conducting an

872
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:39,823
experiment, a 
social experiment.

873
00:37:39,865 --> 00:37:42,325
And your lovely 
bride and I would both

874
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:44,202

very much like you to

875
00:37:44,286 --> 00:37:45,996
participate, if 
you would just...

876
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,748

Who are you?

877
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:50,125

I'm Detective Lee Scanlon

878
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,418

with the Phoenix Police,

879
00:37:51,459 --> 00:37:52,752
and you're 
under arrest for the

880
00:37:52,836 --> 00:37:54,045

murder of my sister, Lorraine.

881
00:37:54,129 --> 00:37:56,840
Now drop that gun, and 
I'll read you your rights.

882
00:37:56,923 --> 00:37:58,091

( distant siren wailing )

883
00:37:58,174 --> 00:37:59,676
Or you can try 
something stupid

884
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:01,469

and we'll get a priest in here

885
00:38:01,553 --> 00:38:03,722
to read you a 
different set of rights.

886
00:38:03,805 --> 00:38:07,142

( siren continues )

887
00:38:07,225 --> 00:38:08,393

( car pulling to a stop )

888
00:38:08,476 --> 00:38:11,771

Please, give me an excuse.

889
00:38:13,148 --> 00:38:15,358

( sobbing )

890
00:38:28,204 --> 00:38:30,331

( distant siren wailing )

891
00:38:40,758 --> 00:38:43,344
Put your hands 
behind your head.

892
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:48,850
You have the right to 
remain silent. Fascinating.

893
00:38:48,933 --> 00:38:50,476
It's an absolutely 
fascinating display.

894
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,019
Anything you say 
can and will be used

895
00:38:52,103 --> 00:38:53,688

against you in a court of law.

896
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:55,189
You have the 
right to counsel. You

897
00:38:55,273 --> 00:38:56,607
so obviously 
wanted to kill me...

898
00:38:56,691 --> 00:38:57,859

If you are unable to retain

899
00:38:57,942 --> 00:38:59,277
counsel... and 
easily could have.

900
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,945
...counsel will be 
appointed for you....

901
00:39:00,987 --> 00:39:02,655
And yet, convention 
and society and a host

902
00:39:02,697 --> 00:39:04,240
of other outside 
forces convinced you

903
00:39:04,323 --> 00:39:05,449

that your own survival...

904
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:06,951
...you will 
still have the right...

905
00:39:07,034 --> 00:39:09,662
...depended upon 
your ability to suppress

906
00:39:09,745 --> 00:39:11,330
your desire for 
revenge and let me live,

907
00:39:11,372 --> 00:39:12,623

and that's fascinating. ...are

908
00:39:12,707 --> 00:39:13,958
you willing to 
answer questions

909
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:15,167

without an attorney present?

910
00:39:15,251 --> 00:39:17,002
I'm so glad I 
was here to see it.

911
00:39:18,337 --> 00:39:19,338

That was

912
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:20,715
extraordinarily 
courageous, Lee.

913
00:39:20,798 --> 00:39:22,466
I'm genuinely proud 
to call you my friend.

914
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,218
Ah, there was 
nothing courageous about it.

915
00:39:24,301 --> 00:39:25,428

I knew he wasn't going to

916
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:26,971
shoot. Not her. 
Not me. Not anybody.

917
00:39:27,054 --> 00:39:28,055

Oh, and how did you know

918
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:29,181

that? Oh, Allison told me.

919
00:39:29,265 --> 00:39:30,808
I did not! I did 
not say... You didn't?

920
00:39:30,891 --> 00:39:32,560
...a word to you 
before you went in there.

921
00:39:32,643 --> 00:39:33,686

Damn. I must need a drink.

922
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:34,770

Anyone interested?

923
00:39:34,854 --> 00:39:36,105
Wait a second. 
What time is it?

924
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:37,606
Uh, 7:35. I do 
believe I'm buying

925
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,108
Oh, my gosh. I 
completely forgot.

926
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:40,943
I have to rush 
home and get surprised.

927
00:39:41,026 --> 00:39:42,820
But I'll take a 
rain check on that drink.

928
00:39:42,903 --> 00:39:44,488
DEVALOS: Oh, 
right, right, right...

929
00:39:44,571 --> 00:39:45,990

Hey, guys!

930
00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:47,616

Sorry I'm late for dinner!

931
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,120

Things got crazy at work...

932
00:39:51,203 --> 00:39:53,497

and...

933
00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:04,758

Hello?

934
00:40:07,427 --> 00:40:09,596

Anybody home?

935
00:40:17,229 --> 00:40:19,314

Okay.

936
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:22,859

I'll play.

937
00:40:41,128 --> 00:40:43,547

Hello?

938
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:08,697

( sighs )

939
00:41:12,075 --> 00:41:14,661

JOE: Happy Birthday, baby.

940
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:18,998
I don't get it. 
Where is everybody?

941
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,500

Well, let's see...

942
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:21,668

Ariel is sleeping over at

943
00:41:21,751 --> 00:41:22,752

her friend Megan's house.

944
00:41:22,836 --> 00:41:24,754
Bridgette's sleeping 
over at Hannah's house.

945
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:27,131
And Marie is at my 
sister's in Prescott.

946
00:41:27,215 --> 00:41:28,216

What?

947
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:29,551

Surprised?

948
00:41:29,634 --> 00:41:31,427

Confused.

949
00:41:31,511 --> 00:41:32,887

Oh. Did I leave out the part

950
00:41:32,971 --> 00:41:34,222

where you and I go to Mexico

951
00:41:34,305 --> 00:41:36,015
for the weekend 
for your birthday?

952
00:41:37,892 --> 00:41:39,811

( car horn honks )

953
00:41:39,894 --> 00:41:42,355
That would be the 
limo to take us...

954
00:41:42,438 --> 00:41:44,774

to the airport.

955
00:41:44,857 --> 00:41:46,609
What about all 
the party supplies...

956
00:41:46,693 --> 00:41:48,444
( chuckling ): 
and the phone calls?

957
00:41:48,528 --> 00:41:50,113
It's not easy 
surprising someone

958
00:41:50,196 --> 00:41:52,073
who's always one 
step ahead of you.

959
00:41:59,247 --> 00:42:00,706

You bastard.

960
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:01,999

Thank you.

961
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:03,960
Now hurry up and 
put together a bag.

962
00:42:04,043 --> 00:42:05,753
I'm going to go 
out and make sure

963
00:42:05,836 --> 00:42:07,838
the driver has 
the champagne chilling

964
00:42:07,922 --> 00:42:09,674
and gloat to 
myself over the fact

965
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:11,175
that I finally 
put one over on you.

966
00:42:13,261 --> 00:42:15,096

( chuckles )

967
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:17,098
I don't know if I 
can get ready that fast.

968
00:42:17,181 --> 00:42:18,808
Well, put your 
track shoes on, baby,

969
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:20,976
'cause our plane 
leaves in exactly one hour.

970
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,232

Hey, Hot Lips, hurry up.

971
00:42:26,232 --> 00:42:28,567

Driver says there's traffic.

972
00:42:28,651 --> 00:42:32,071

I'm packing as fast as I can!

973
00:42:43,624 --> 00:42:46,919

Okay, I'm ready.

974
00:42:47,002 --> 00:42:49,338
I can't believe 
you did this to me.

975
00:42:49,421 --> 00:42:51,674
I hope I didn't 
forget anything.

976
00:42:51,757 --> 00:42:54,176
Just wait till 
your birthday comes.
