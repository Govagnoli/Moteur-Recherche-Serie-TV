1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,800
I don't understand.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,600
I thought you said
she was getting better.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,600
She fooled us.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,700
The leukemia fooled us.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,800
For a while it seemed
like she was responding
to the treatment.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,200
Unfortunately, her blood
cell count keeps dropping.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I don't know if her system
can take another
round of chemo.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,300
I'm so sorry.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,000
I'll make it a point
to stop back

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
when your parents are here.
Thank you.

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,200
Wow.

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,800
How long was I out?

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,300
Just a few minutes.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,200
It's weird
the way you do that.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
So sudden.

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,700
Hmm.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,200
Mom and Dad went
to grab a bite.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,100
Hey. I almost forgot.

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,600
I... I brought you
something.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,100
(gasping):
No!

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,900
It's Mr. Snookie!

22
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,400
Where in the hell
did you find him?

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,500
Me and Dad tore the garage apart
until we found him.

24
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,200
Hmm. He looks as old

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,000
and crappy as I feel.
(light cough)

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,100
Yeah, that German shepherd
really did a number on him, huh?

27
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,500
It's okay.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,100
Sorry.

29
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,300
(weakly):
I get so tired.

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,900
It's okay.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
WOMAN:
You girls decent in there?

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hell, no.

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,900
We're Dubois women.

34
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,500
Nothing decent about us.

35
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,200
Was she out the whole time?

36
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,400
30 seconds ago,
she was laughing.

37
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,500
The chemo's just completely
knocked the crap out of her.

38
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,400
Doctor came by.

39
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,500
Said it wasn't really helping.

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,300
Did Marie hear?

41
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,700
No.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,900
Ariel...

43
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,900
Do me a favor.

44
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,400
You've got to go outside,
call Bridgette.

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay? Tell her we need her.

46
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,000
Daddy or I will pick her
up at the airport,

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,800
but she needs
to come today.

48
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,600
(sobbing)
Okay? Tonight.

49
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,900
ALLISON:
Shh.

50
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,100
I'm going to miss
her so much.

51
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,400
I don't know if I can
live without her.

52
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,400
Hi. You're there.

53
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,900
This is Allison Dubois.

54
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,100
I was wondering, is there
any way I could possibly

55
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,700
bring in my youngest daughter in

56
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,800
to see the doctor today?

57
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
11:00. Thank you.

58
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,000
Bye.
(phone beeps off)

59
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,200
Hey.
Hey.

60
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Woke up.

61
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,600
Your side of the
bed was empty.

62
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,600
Cold. How long
you been up?

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,200
I don't know.

64
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,400
I think Marie's coming down
with something.

65
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,800
I was up with her
half the night.

66
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,400
Is it serious?

67
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,300
I hope not.

68
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,900
I hope I caught it in time.

69
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,800
She seems fine now.

70
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,800
I'm just going
to keep her home

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,300
and run her by the doctor.

72
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,300
ALL:
God, grant me the serenity

73
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,900
to accept the things
I cannot change,

74
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,600
courage to change
the things I can,

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,100
and wisdom to know
the difference.

76
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,300
<i>SCANLON:
I just think it's weird,
that's all.</i>

77
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,800
The guy calls me
first thing this morning

78
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
to make sure I'm going
to be at the meeting,
then he doesn't show up.

79
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,600
Gary's a recovering addict.

80
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,900
We're all
recovering addicts.

81
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,100
Reliability is not
our strong suit.

82
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
He's going to do
what he's going to do.

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,300
You're his sponsor,
not his mother.

84
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,500
As long as you're there
when he does calls you.

85
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,900
<i>Long as you're there
when he does show up.</i>

86
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
The rest is up to him.

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,100
That's Gary's car.

88
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,500
<i>MAN:
Good news.</i>

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,200
There's no strep.
No fever.

90
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,200
Her inoculations are up to date.

91
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,400
The truth is...

92
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
She looks super.

93
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,700
Okay.

94
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,000
So I'm... I'm a little unclear.

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,400
Is this an exam for school?

96
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,300
For day care? For camp?

97
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,000
Is there something
you want me to sign?

98
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,700
I need you to talk
to me about leukemia.

99
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Leukemia?

100
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,100
Are we still talking
about Marie?

101
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,800
Well, ah...

102
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,700
Wh-what would you like to know?

103
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
Has she been tired?

104
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,000
She doesn't look tired.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,700
I didn't notic
any swelling

106
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,600
or weight loss.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Allison, leukemia's
a hell of a rabbit
to pull out of your hat.

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,600
It would help me to know
where this comes from.

109
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,500
Hi, Jen?

110
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,900
Uh, could you come
in here for a second

111
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,200
and get Marie Dubois?

112
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah, keep an eye
on her for a minute,

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,300
so her mom and I can
have a conversation.

114
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,400
No, no, I... I know.

115
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,500
I know how backed up we are.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,800
Thank you.

117
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,500
Okay, baby, Mommy's
gonna come get you
in a minute, okay?

118
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,800
Okay.

119
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,700
Allison, look,
I know you know this,

120
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,000
but, uh...

121
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,500
Leukemia is not something
she's going to catch
on the playground.

122
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,400
You've never mentioned
a family history of it.

123
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,300
It's never

124
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,400
come up in conversation
about the other girls.

125
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,900
Has something happened?

126
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,800
Someone on your husband's side?

127
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,900
I just need to know:
is this the kind of disease

128
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,300
that you can get
in front of it?

129
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,100
<i>Treat it
before it strikes?</i>

130
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Allison, what you're saying
doesn't make any sense.

131
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,900
We don't... we don't
treat people for diseases

132
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,100
before they have them.

133
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,000
Before they have them
there is nothing to treat.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But with leukemia, with
cancer, I mean, in theory...

135
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,200
It's already in there
waiting to happen, right?

136
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,600
I am not an oncologist.

137
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,300
But that's kind
of a simple way of...

138
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,300
What if I had had it?

139
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,800
Or my mother had had it?

140
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,800
Aren't there things
you would be doing?

141
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,900
Tests you would be running
to keep an eye on it
in the children?

142
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,200
But you don't
have it,
and as for your mother...

143
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,100
But if we did?

144
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,100
Allison.

145
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,900
The kind of tests
you're talking about

146
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,400
are... invasive.

147
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,200
Painful. It's not something
you'd want done to a child

148
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,700
unless it was
completely necessary.

149
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,600
And they're expensive.

150
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,900
You know, insurance
won't cover them

151
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,100
unless there's some
credible diagnostic rationale.

152
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,100
You know, forgive
my asking this,

153
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,400
but does Joe know you're here?

154
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,600
Talking to me about this?

155
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,200
I didn't want to alarm him

156
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,400
till I knew more.

157
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,900
Allison, I have to be
honest with you,

158
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,900
this-this... this is
kind of crazy talk.

159
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,100
If this were anybody else, if I didn't know
you as well as I do,

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,800
I would be tempted
to pick up the phone
and call Child Services.

161
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,300
All right, so here's
what I'm willing to do.

162
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,200
Let's draw some blood.

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,800
Okay? We'll send it
to the lab.

164
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,300
That is the first place
we would see
any indication of disease.

165
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,500
Thank you, Doctor.

Sorry. I lost track of time.

I appreciate this,

Allison? It's Dr. Bondi.

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,600
I have to tell you
that little girl
is as healthy as a horse.

180
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
If there's anything in her blood

181
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,800
that's going to compromise
her health,

182
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,000
modern science can't currently
see it, much less treat it.

183
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,800
Will she be healthy
15 or 20 years from now?

184
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,600
<i>Nobody knows that.</i>

185
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,100
<i>But now that I know
it's an issue for you,</i>

186
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,300
<i>we can test Marie
every time she comes in.
Hi, I'm home.</i>

187
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,900
<i>Allison, any one
of our kids could get hit
by a car tomorrow,</i>

188
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,100
<i>be felled by the flu.</i>

189
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,200
<i>It's how we love them
while they're here.</i>

190
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,600
<i>While we're here.</i>

191
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,700
<i>Well, anyway,
you get the point.</i>

192
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,000
<i>Right now, she's the living
definition of healthy</i>

193
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,200
<i>and right now
is all we can control.</i>

194
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Hey...
I'm home too.

195
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,800
Hey.

196
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,000
All the really big bosses
are away at a seminar,

197
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,200
and I figured there was nothing
I was doing at my desk

198
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,900
that I can't do at home
on my laptop.

199
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,200
Hey, we're teaching Marie how
to play Monkey in the Middle.

200
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,300
She's a very good monkey.

201
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,500
You got cake?

202
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,900
Is it somebody's birthday?

203
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,300
Celebrating just to celebrate.

204
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,600
Cool.

205
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,700
Mmm... yum.

206
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,700
What's the occasion?

207
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,800
You know, one day, you're
feeling kind of down...

208
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,200
the next day the sun's out
and things look...

209
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,400
(dog growling)
Hey, get out of here!

210
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,500
Get out!
(dog growling)

211
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,700
Hey! Hey!
Get out!

212
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,100
Hey, kids! Get away
from that dog!

213
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,700
Let him go, Ariel!

214
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,800
Ariel! Ariel!
Just let the dog have it!

215
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,000
Ariel, get inside!

216
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,600
Doggy hurt Mr. Snookie.

217
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,100
Daddy ran outside and saved you?

218
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,200
Ariel saved Mr. Snookie.

219
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,300
What were you thinking, Ariel?

220
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,000
He could have attacked you.
He could have bitten you.

221
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,200
But he had Mr. Snookie and...
I don't care!

222
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,300
You act like that to save
one of your sisters,

223
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,000
not a teddy bear.

224
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,500
Okay?

225
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,900
Hey...
Are you okay?

226
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,600
Honey, why the long face?

227
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,600
Everybody's doing just fine.

228
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,100
Everybody's fine.

229
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,900
JOE:
Leukemia?

230
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,100
She was 20, maybe 21.

231
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,000
But the doctor said she's fine.

232
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,900
Yes, today. Yes, now.

233
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,400
Okay, then, uh...
wait, I don't understand.

234
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,600
What is there not to understand?

235
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,900
The doctor said she's fine.

236
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,300
And for now, she is.

237
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,000
He didn't say
she would always be fine.

238
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,800
There's no way
he could possibly know that.

239
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,200
But I know that.

240
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,500
Just like I saw Ariel give
Marie that torn-up teddy bear.

241
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,800
No, Allison.

242
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,200
Even though it just happened.

243
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,400
Just got torn up
a few hours ago.

244
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,600
Please listen to yourself.

245
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,500
That teddy bear has nothing
to do with anything.

246
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,800
You're not listening!

247
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,600
That torn-up teddy bear

248
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,400
has everything
to do with everything.

249
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,700
I saw it last night

250
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,500
before it happened,

251
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,100
in the same dream

252
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,200
that I saw
our youngest daughter...

253
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,600
dying.

254
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,700
Ariel

255
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,100
said you and her
went into the garage,

256
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,800
and you found that torn-up
teddy bear,

257
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,200
and she wanted
to give it to Marie,

258
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,300
and that's how I know this
is going to happen, you see?

259
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,300
No, I don't see.

260
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,400
Actually, Allison,
you're not making any sense.

261
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,200
Oh, really?

262
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,200
After all this time,

263
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,100
are you saying
that you don't believe in me?

264
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,300
You don't believe
in the things that I see?

265
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,000
Or the things th I feel?

266
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,200
Of course I'm
not saying that.

267
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,400
I absolutely
believe in you.

268
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,200
I'm not questioning
what you see.

269
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,900
It's your logic
that makes no sense.

270
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,300
I'll prove
it to you.

271
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,800
Joe!

272
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,100
What are you doing?

273
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,600
I'm saving our
daughter's life.

274
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,300
What are you talking about?

275
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,200
(whispers):
I'm gonna go,
and I'm gonna take that bear,

276
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,000
and I'm gonna burn it
in the backyard.

277
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Don't you see?

278
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,100
Look, according to your logic,

279
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,100
if there's no bear in the
garage 20 years from now,

280
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,200
then there's nothing for
Ariel to give to Marie

281
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,500
when she goes
into the hospital,

282
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,300
so maybe she's not
in the hospital,

283
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,800
'cause maybe she's not sick.

284
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,500
(whispers):
You're mocking me.

285
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,800
No!

286
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,700
I am trying to
get you to see

287
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,500
how irrational
and potentially dangerous,

288
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,400
destructive your thinking is.

289
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Look, Allison, hey.

290
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Look, listen,
listen, sweetie,

291
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,100
look, you may be
right about this.

292
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,200
She may be fated to die
before her time,

293
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,500
but what's the point of living

294
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,100
for her and for us,

295
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,100
if her whole life
is spent chasing a tragedy

296
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,100
that we're not sure
is ever really gonna happen,

297
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,200
and which for the
time being we can
do nothing about!

298
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,000
I won't do it!

299
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,500
I'll will take
that bear from her

300
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,500
and I will burn it
in the biggest bonfire

301
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,800
you have ever seen

302
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,300
if it will convince you
to forget about what you saw

303
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,900
for the time being.
Just forget about it

304
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,800
until it
actually happens,

305
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,100
if it actually
happens,

306
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,800
till there's something
that we can do about it.

307
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,400
Do you have any idea
what you're asking of me?!

308
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,500
How hard it would be
for me just to pretend
that everything's fine?!

309
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,700
I don't know if I can!

310
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,100
Wait, wait.
I'm not asking you to pretend.

311
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,100
You're missing the point.

312
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,300
I'm not asking you to pretend.

313
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,800
<i>Everything is fine.</i>

314
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,600
That's how life works.

315
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Everything is fine
until it isn't,

316
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,000
and then you deal with it.

317
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,000
Otherwise, there is no life.

318
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,800
There's just waiting to die.

319
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,500
What the hell is Willow Elm?

320
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,200
Huh?

321
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,100
Willow Elm,
what is that?

322
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,400
Some sort of a tree?

323
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,100
Why are you
looking up trees?

324
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,600
No, I wasn't.

325
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,300
What are you doing?

326
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,900
It's a quarter
after 5:00.

327
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,500
Come back to bed.

328
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,400
I can't sleep.

329
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,300
I keep thinking
about this kid.

330
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Met him at my
NA meeting.

331
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,800
Asked me to be
his sponsor.

332
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,100
He OD'd yesterday.

333
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
I'm sorry.

334
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,200
I have to call his folks
and tell them.

335
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,200
They're back east in Delaware,
two hours ahead of us.

336
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,400
I want to get them
before they go to work.

337
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm figuring 5:30 here,
7:30 there.

338
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,100
I'm dreading it.

339
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,400
I'll sit with you.

340
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,400
I'll help you through it.

341
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Thanks.

342
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,100
<i>DOCTOR:
I'm afraid
all we can really do</i>

343
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,500
at this point is make her
as comfortable as possible.

344
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,700
What about more chemo?

345
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,500
I mean, I know it's...
it's knocking her on her ass.

346
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,600
See, there's a tipping point
with the chemo,

347
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,100
where the cure
is worse than the disease

348
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,400
and we've passed
that point, I'm afraid.

349
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,700
So what do we do?

350
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,000
You gather
your loved ones,

351
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,000
and you say your good-byes.

352
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,200
This is our fault, you know?

353
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,800
I knew it. I told you

354
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
we should not have stayed
in that house.

355
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,700
(sobbing):
We should not have stayed
in that house.

356
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You okay?

357
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,300
I'm fine.

358
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,900
Actually, I'm good.

359
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,200
You're right.
None of it means anything

360
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,100
until it's clear
what you can do to stop it.

361
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What?

362
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,000
We're moving.

363
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:43,261
I don't understand.

364
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:45,361
What is it exactly
about this house

365
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:46,861
that is going
to make Marie sick?

366
00:18:47,331 --> 00:18:48,431
Is this about mold?

367
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:50,031
Is this about radon?

368
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,531
It's not like
we're close to
any power lines.

369
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,431
I don't know.
What difference does it make?

370
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:57,031
What you need to know
is we need to get our
little girl out of here.

371
00:18:57,031 --> 00:18:57,931
We need to move.

372
00:18:57,931 --> 00:18:59,131
Allison, whoa!

373
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,931
Do you understand
what you're saying: "move"?

374
00:19:02,531 --> 00:19:04,131
It's... it's not that easy.

375
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,931
Finding a new house takes time.

376
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:09,731
Selling the house that we have
is going to take time.

377
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,631
I don't even know
what this place is worth.

378
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:12,931
People do it every day.

379
00:19:13,331 --> 00:19:15,731
Yeah, people do it every day,
Allison,

380
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:17,431
<i>but nobody does it in a day.</i>

381
00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:21,431
"Willow Elm."

382
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:23,331
What?

383
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:25,431
Willow Elm's the answer.

384
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,331
<i>Now what you're walking through</i>

385
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:30,731
is the "Hacienda" model
of Phase 3 here at Willow Elm.

386
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:34,231
We've got 108 acres here,

387
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:37,831
over $400 million
in construction...

388
00:19:38,831 --> 00:19:40,631
Bunford Properties'
biggest project to date.

389
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:42,731
Oh, beautiful kitchen,
beautiful everything.

390
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:43,531
Thank you.

391
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:46,731
Obviously, there's all kinds
of upgrades and options available.

392
00:19:47,431 --> 00:19:48,231
Take a look around.

393
00:19:49,031 --> 00:19:51,231
Any of my salespeople
will be happy to answer

394
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,531
any question you might have.

395
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:56,831
And please, feel free to call me
or e-mail me directly.

396
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,531
It's perfect.

397
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:00,931
You don't
really know that.

398
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:02,331
I mean, you can't
possibly know that.

399
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:05,031
You just spent
20 minutes in a model home.

400
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:07,531
That hardly constitutes
a thorough evaluation.

401
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:09,331
It's Willow Elm.
It's perfect.

402
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:10,631
It's where we're
supposed to be.

403
00:20:10,631 --> 00:20:12,631
Allison...
What?

404
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:14,131
we don't even know
if we can afford it.

405
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,431
It's a house.
It's not an impulse buy.

406
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:17,431
It's our child!

407
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:20,831
I know, I know,
but we have everything
we have worked for

408
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:22,031
tied up in that house.

409
00:20:22,031 --> 00:20:23,831
Now, wouldn't the
logical thing...
figure out if

410
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:24,731
No, the logical thing?

411
00:20:24,731 --> 00:20:26,731
The logical thing is this second.
figure out if

412
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:29,231
The instant you find out
your child is in peril
before we uproot the kids!

413
00:20:29,231 --> 00:20:32,931
you do whatever
you have to save them
as quickly as you can

414
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,031
and you screw
the money!
It makes no sense!

415
00:20:35,631 --> 00:20:37,331
I don't understand!

416
00:20:37,331 --> 00:20:39,931
I don't understand
how you could treat
all of this

417
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:40,931
as if it isn't real.

418
00:20:40,931 --> 00:20:43,531
We're talking
about our child's life!

419
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:44,931
No, don't do that!

420
00:20:44,931 --> 00:20:46,731
Don't do what?!
Don't act like

421
00:20:46,731 --> 00:20:49,131
I am sending our child
off to a certain death

422
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:51,531
just because I want to
stop and take a breath

423
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:53,331
and see if any of
this makes sense!

424
00:20:53,331 --> 00:20:55,231
Make sense!
Don't do that,
either,

425
00:20:56,431 --> 00:20:57,531
'cause I am here!

426
00:20:58,731 --> 00:21:02,131
I took the morningoff work
I am in this with you!

427
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:05,131
Someone has to ask
these questions!

428
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:08,731
Well, you do that, Joe.
You ask those questions.

429
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:13,531
So I have a question.

430
00:21:14,631 --> 00:21:16,131
Who's going to call
the Realtor?

431
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:20,231
I don't understand.
What's the mystery?

432
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:22,731
Kid was a drug addict.
He died of an overdose.

433
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:24,031
I know that.
Just the same,

434
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:25,631
I need you to perform
another autopsy.

435
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:30,531
Just because somebody
wona free one during
the silent auction

436
00:21:30,531 --> 00:21:31,731
at this year's
Police Fundraiser?

437
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:33,131
I knew this kid.

438
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:34,831
I called his folks
after we found him.

439
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:35,731
They made me promise.

440
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:39,431
The overdose thing--
it just doesn't add up for them.

441
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,631
Wow, parents don't believe
their baby's a junkie.

442
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:44,231
There's one
I haven't heard before.

443
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:45,631
No, they knew
their kid had a history,

444
00:21:45,631 --> 00:21:48,931
but he's also a medical student,
very careful, very fastidious.

445
00:21:48,931 --> 00:21:50,931
They just don't believe he
wouldn't know what he was taking

446
00:21:50,931 --> 00:21:51,831
and how much to take.

447
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:54,831
I see, so the city of Phoenix
is going to pay for an autopsy

448
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:58,531
to test the quality of a young,
dead addict's medical education.

449
00:22:02,731 --> 00:22:03,631
Please?

450
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:09,931
If we're getting a new house,
who's gonna live here?

451
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:11,631
Excellent question.

452
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:12,931
Oh, I spoke with a Realtor.

453
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,831
She's gonna stop by tomorrow
and take a look,

454
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:15,831
give us an appraisal.

455
00:22:15,831 --> 00:22:16,831
Uh-huh.

456
00:22:17,431 --> 00:22:21,831
So if me and Marie
are getting our own rooms,

457
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:23,831
then maybe we should leave
the bunk beds here

458
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:26,431
for whoever moves in, right?

459
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:31,231
I mean, they're gonna have
kids, too, right?

460
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:42,631
I don't think I can do it.

461
00:22:42,631 --> 00:22:44,631
I don't think
I can sell a poisoned house.

462
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:53,231
Look, truth be told,
I don't want to move.

463
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:54,531
I don't want to sell
this house.

464
00:22:54,531 --> 00:22:55,631
I mean, I will
if I have to,

465
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:57,831
but just to play
devil's advocate,

466
00:22:58,231 --> 00:23:00,231
we don't know for sure
that it's poisoned.

467
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:02,231
I mean, maybe it's not
poisoned yet.

468
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:05,131
Maybe that's something
that happens in the future.

469
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:06,831
Are you kidding?

470
00:23:06,831 --> 00:23:08,831
You really think
that takes us off the hook?

471
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:10,031
Well, I don't
know, Allison.

472
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:12,031
First you tell me
we got to move

473
00:23:12,231 --> 00:23:14,131
because our daughter's
going to get sick and die,

474
00:23:14,331 --> 00:23:15,831
and then you tell me
that you don't want to move

475
00:23:15,831 --> 00:23:16,931
because you can't
bear the thought

476
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:18,331
of somebody else
getting sick and dying.

477
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:20,931
Just tell me which side
you want me to take
in this argument

478
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:23,231
'cause I can't seem
to find one thatorks.

479
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:26,531
We cannot afford to move

480
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:29,131
unless and until
we sell this house.

481
00:23:29,731 --> 00:23:31,131
Do you understand that?

482
00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:34,431
We can't, in good conscience,

483
00:23:34,431 --> 00:23:35,831
sell this house

484
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,731
not to a family
with small children,

485
00:23:37,731 --> 00:23:38,831
not to anyone.

486
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:40,431
God, I hate this!

487
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:43,831
I'm sorry.
I don't share your sense
of unlimited responsibility

488
00:23:43,831 --> 00:23:46,931
for absolutely everything
from now until the end of time.

489
00:23:46,931 --> 00:23:48,131
What are you talking about?

490
00:23:48,631 --> 00:23:49,631
When we bought
this house

491
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:51,731
it was, to the best of our
knowledge and to the knowledge

492
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:53,531
of the people who sold it to us,
clean.

493
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:55,831
It may very well be
that it is still clean.

494
00:23:55,831 --> 00:23:57,831
As a homeowner,
I got a responsibility

495
00:23:57,831 --> 00:23:59,531
to make sure
that the house stays clean,

496
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:03,031
to test it from time to time
to make repairs,
adjustments...

497
00:24:03,031 --> 00:24:04,431
Okay, where are you going
with this?

498
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:05,631
We'll get the
house tested.

499
00:24:06,431 --> 00:24:07,431
We'll call someone in.

500
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:09,231
We'll have them test the house
for everything.

501
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:12,131
We'll do everything we can
to make sure
the house is safe to sell.

502
00:24:13,231 --> 00:24:15,031
I think that's all
that anyone can expect.

503
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:18,831
I don't know.

504
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:21,531
Or we stay.

505
00:24:22,931 --> 00:24:24,931
And we never speak
another word about it.

506
00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:30,731
<i>I don't understand.
I heard he died
of a drug overdose.</i>

507
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:33,231
Really? Is that
what you heard, huh?

508
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:34,731
I'm just telling you.

509
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:37,831
There it is, Detective.

510
00:24:38,731 --> 00:24:41,031
Thanks, I'll try
and bring it back
with a full tank of gas.

511
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:17,831
I have been waiting for days,
Doctor!

512
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:22,831
Mrs. Dubois, as my staff
has repeatedly explained to you,

513
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:25,931
hospital hours are for surgeries
and follow-ups.

514
00:25:25,931 --> 00:25:28,231
Office hours are for meetings
and consults.

515
00:25:28,531 --> 00:25:30,631
Now, as soon as I have
some office hours free,

516
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:33,231
my staff will call you
to set up a meeting.

517
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,031
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm on my way to surgery.

518
00:25:36,031 --> 00:25:39,631
I'm sorry. My daughter is dead,
and you killed her!

519
00:25:40,231 --> 00:25:41,431
Would you say
that is more

520
00:25:41,431 --> 00:25:44,031
of a follow-up or would that be
an office visit?

521
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:46,731
Mrs. Dubois, you are violating
the restraining order.

522
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:49,131
Fine. Call the police.

523
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:51,531
I don't want
to call the police.

524
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:55,531
Honestly, all of this
is unnecessary.

525
00:25:56,231 --> 00:25:57,831
I told you how sorry I am.

526
00:25:58,731 --> 00:25:59,731
I-I explained

527
00:25:59,731 --> 00:26:01,331
that we did everything
that we could.

528
00:26:01,331 --> 00:26:03,131
Well, see,
I don't see it that way!

529
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:05,831
You were there
from the beginning.

530
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,431
You knew
what was happening!

531
00:26:07,431 --> 00:26:10,031
How many more people are going
to die because of you?!

532
00:26:10,231 --> 00:26:11,231
Mrs. Dubois,

533
00:26:11,531 --> 00:26:12,631
this has to stop.

534
00:26:13,331 --> 00:26:14,831
If you'd like to contact me,

535
00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:17,031
I'm going to insist you do so
through my attorney.

536
00:26:26,707 --> 00:26:28,207
Someone looks unhappy.

537
00:26:29,507 --> 00:26:30,907
Mm, let's review.

538
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,807
As of today, our youngest
daughter has been given

539
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:36,807
an absolutely clean
bill of health;

540
00:26:37,807 --> 00:26:40,407
our house has also
been given a clean
bill of health;

541
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:46,407
our real estate broker just
this evening has assured us

542
00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:49,607
that we can almost certainly
get enough for our present home

543
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:53,307
to begin 30 years
of new debt
on the one in Willow Elm.

544
00:26:55,307 --> 00:26:56,507
Have I skipped
anything?

545
00:26:56,807 --> 00:26:59,307
Left any bad news out?

546
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,207
What if I'm wrong
about everything?

547
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:11,107
Wow, a moment
of self-doubt.

548
00:27:11,907 --> 00:27:14,407
That's new.
That's different.

549
00:27:15,807 --> 00:27:17,207
I kind of like it.

550
00:27:17,207 --> 00:27:19,107
You're joking. I'm serious.

551
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:23,607
What if I make us
go through all of this moving,

552
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:25,707
making new friends,

553
00:27:26,807 --> 00:27:29,407
shaking everything up
when I was already just fine,

554
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:32,407
and it's all for nothing?

555
00:27:32,807 --> 00:27:34,007
Then we'll just
have to tough it out.

556
00:27:34,807 --> 00:27:37,807
You know, bigger bathrooms,
nicer bedrooms,

557
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:39,807
modern kitchen.

558
00:27:41,707 --> 00:27:45,607
And if at some point
I can free our daughters

559
00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:47,807
from the torture
that is the community pool,

560
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:50,907
perhaps we'll find a way
forgive you.

561
00:27:52,107 --> 00:27:52,907
Hmm.

562
00:27:58,307 --> 00:27:59,607
<i>SCANLON:
New house? That's exciting.</i>

563
00:27:59,607 --> 00:28:01,707
Yeah, I got to drop off
all the signed paperwork

564
00:28:01,707 --> 00:28:03,207
at the sales office
in an hour.

565
00:28:03,607 --> 00:28:05,407
I mean, we still have
to sell our old place.

566
00:28:05,407 --> 00:28:06,607
We still have
to get our loan.

567
00:28:07,607 --> 00:28:08,907
Or we could
still fall through.

568
00:28:09,607 --> 00:28:12,907
No, I can see how busy you are.
I appreciate you doing this.

569
00:28:13,607 --> 00:28:15,607
I'm happy to see
whoever you like,

570
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:17,607
just don't be surprised
if I come up empty.

571
00:28:18,307 --> 00:28:19,407
Now, who's this again?

572
00:28:19,607 --> 00:28:20,607
Gary's roommate.

573
00:28:20,807 --> 00:28:21,807
He's finally
back in town.

574
00:28:21,807 --> 00:28:22,707
I asked him
to come down

575
00:28:22,707 --> 00:28:23,907
see if he could
shed some light.

576
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:25,707
Nice kid.
Pretty upset.

577
00:28:26,507 --> 00:28:27,907
Apparently,
they were very close.

578
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,007
This is the woman from
the District Attorney's office
I told you about.

579
00:28:32,007 --> 00:28:33,007
She's helping me
with the case.

580
00:28:34,907 --> 00:28:37,207
Allison Dubois,
David Channing.

581
00:28:37,807 --> 00:28:38,607
Hi.

582
00:28:38,907 --> 00:28:39,807
Doctor...

583
00:28:43,207 --> 00:28:44,007
Are you okay?

584
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:45,807
I'm sorry.

585
00:28:47,407 --> 00:28:50,907
You just bear an
uncanny resemblance
to a doctor I know,

586
00:28:50,907 --> 00:28:52,007
an oncologist.

587
00:28:52,307 --> 00:28:53,807
Of course, he's
a bit older than you.

588
00:28:54,507 --> 00:28:55,907
He could almost
be your father.

589
00:28:56,807 --> 00:28:59,607
He's not my father.
My father's a postman.

590
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:02,807
Now, look, David
is a medical student.

591
00:29:03,607 --> 00:29:06,907
Yeah, although I don't think
oncology's in my future.

592
00:29:07,907 --> 00:29:09,107
I don't think I'd enjoy knowing

593
00:29:09,107 --> 00:29:10,907
that everyone who came to see me
most likely

594
00:29:10,907 --> 00:29:12,807
already had
a fatal disease, you know?

595
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:16,207
But you never know.

596
00:29:16,707 --> 00:29:17,907
Yeah, you never know.

597
00:29:20,507 --> 00:29:22,607
I really have to get
these across town.

598
00:29:23,107 --> 00:29:25,007
Of course.
I just wanted
you guys to meet.

599
00:29:25,507 --> 00:29:27,107
Uh, give me a second
to walk her out.

600
00:29:30,107 --> 00:29:31,107
Nice meeting you.

601
00:29:32,507 --> 00:29:33,607
Talk to me.
What'd you see?

602
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:34,907
It's nothing.

603
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:36,207
Nothing that applies
to this case.

604
00:29:36,907 --> 00:29:37,807
What are you talking about?

605
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:39,407
You saw him,
you turned white as a ghost.

606
00:29:39,607 --> 00:29:40,607
It's nothing.

607
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:41,907
It's personal.

608
00:29:42,107 --> 00:29:44,207
A really weird coincidence.

609
00:29:44,607 --> 00:29:46,007
I really got to go.

610
00:29:46,207 --> 00:29:47,207
All right,
I appreciate it.

611
00:29:47,207 --> 00:29:48,507
Sorry it was all
for naught.

612
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:52,707
<i>Are you aware that Gary
had a history with narcotics?</i>

613
00:29:52,907 --> 00:29:54,307
Yeah, we were friends.

614
00:29:54,507 --> 00:29:58,107
I mean, we lived together.
We went to med school together.

615
00:29:58,507 --> 00:29:59,307
Of course, I knew.

616
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:03,207
I mean, it wasn't something
he bragged about.

617
00:30:04,707 --> 00:30:06,707
Although, I think
he took a lot of pride

618
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:08,507
in the fact he was able
to put it behind him.

619
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:12,607
At least he said that he had.

620
00:30:12,607 --> 00:30:14,507
I thought
that he had.

621
00:30:17,307 --> 00:30:20,107
Gary mentioned
you guys met working
in a lab last summer.

622
00:30:20,607 --> 00:30:23,107
Yeah. Lab tech work;

623
00:30:23,707 --> 00:30:26,307
like, petri dish cultures,
things like that.

624
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:28,107
Do any work with lab rats?

625
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:30,907
Sure, we did everything
with lab rats.

626
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:33,207
You personally?

627
00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:35,307
Yeah, that's what
they paid us to do.

628
00:30:35,307 --> 00:30:38,807
You know, a big client comes in
with a... chemical,

629
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:41,707
something they want to put
in a food dye or something,

630
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,207
and they want to see
if it's safe,

631
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:46,207
so you-you inject the rats
with it

632
00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:49,607
and then you wait...
and see if they die.

633
00:30:49,607 --> 00:30:51,207
Of course, if they're lucky
enough to live,

634
00:30:51,207 --> 00:30:53,007
we dissect them anyway;

635
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:55,607
make sure they didn't have
anything wrong with them

636
00:30:55,607 --> 00:30:56,407
on the inside.

637
00:30:56,407 --> 00:30:58,507
It was... it was a fun summer.

638
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:00,407
Do you remember what chemical
you were testing?

639
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:04,507
I remember
that it didn't kill the rats.

640
00:31:05,307 --> 00:31:07,107
Now what's all this about
anyway?

641
00:31:08,407 --> 00:31:11,207
We found a jar
with three dead rats in it
in the back of Gary's car.

642
00:31:12,407 --> 00:31:14,807
Wow. That's weird.

643
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:17,507
That doesn't sound like Gary,

644
00:31:17,507 --> 00:31:18,607
not that I know
what he's like.

645
00:31:18,607 --> 00:31:19,407
I understand.

646
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:22,507
I just figured
they must have come from the lab
you guys worked at.

647
00:31:23,207 --> 00:31:25,207
I don't know.
I kind of doubt that.

648
00:31:25,807 --> 00:31:29,307
These are industrial clients,
big companies.

649
00:31:29,307 --> 00:31:30,907
They need to be sure
their product's safe;

650
00:31:30,907 --> 00:31:32,607
all the rats
tagged and numbered.

651
00:31:33,207 --> 00:31:35,707
We have to document
everything we do
to each and every one of them.

652
00:31:36,607 --> 00:31:39,107
I mean, it wasn't like you could
bring them home as pets or...

653
00:31:41,207 --> 00:31:42,207
I just figured it out.

654
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:44,407
You're the guy that
Gary was always talking about.

655
00:31:44,407 --> 00:31:47,407
The, uh, the cop
that was his sponsor.

656
00:31:50,907 --> 00:31:52,407
He liked you.
He trusted you.

657
00:31:53,207 --> 00:31:55,807
I think he would have
wanted you to know that.

658
00:31:58,907 --> 00:31:59,707
Hi.

659
00:31:59,707 --> 00:32:02,607
Mr. Dubois, nice
to see you again.

660
00:32:03,007 --> 00:32:04,307
Well, my husband
and I talked about it.

661
00:32:04,307 --> 00:32:06,307
We decided we'd like
to move forward.

662
00:32:06,307 --> 00:32:08,107
So I want to bring
the application

663
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:10,407
and our thousand-
dollar deposit.

664
00:32:10,907 --> 00:32:13,007
Fantastic.
Sit down.

665
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,807
We put our house
up on the market,

666
00:32:15,807 --> 00:32:17,307
and my husband's
sitting down

667
00:32:17,307 --> 00:32:18,807
with the mortgage
broker tonight.

668
00:32:19,407 --> 00:32:22,807
Again, I want to emphasize that
for us, speed is of the essence.

669
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:25,007
We need to move
as quickly as possible.

670
00:32:25,507 --> 00:32:26,307
All right, then.

671
00:32:26,707 --> 00:32:27,807
It sounds serious.

672
00:32:28,107 --> 00:32:30,307
Let me dig out
our construction progress list,

673
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:33,307
see which houses are closest
to completion,

674
00:32:33,307 --> 00:32:34,407
take you on a little tour.

675
00:32:39,107 --> 00:32:41,007
The Sheldons are closing
on a three-bedroom.

676
00:32:57,107 --> 00:32:59,907
My husband and I just bought a 
two-bedroom unit ourselves.

677
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:00,907
And do you have kids?

678
00:33:00,907 --> 00:33:03,307
Because this is a terrific
school district here.

679
00:33:10,007 --> 00:33:11,407
Mrs. Dubois are you all right?

680
00:33:13,107 --> 00:33:14,107
Can I get you something?

681
00:33:14,907 --> 00:33:15,907
Maybe a glass of water.

682
00:33:37,747 --> 00:33:38,547
Yeah?

683
00:33:40,647 --> 00:33:41,747
I don't know
if you're aware of it,

684
00:33:41,747 --> 00:33:44,847
but you got about 55 "While you were out" slips 
taped to your cubicle wall.

685
00:33:45,447 --> 00:33:46,647
I think you ought
to call your husband.

686
00:33:48,547 --> 00:33:51,447
Yeah, I will. I just needed
to be alone for a little bit.

687
00:33:52,147 --> 00:33:54,147
So now wouldn't be a good time
to ask you a question?

688
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:57,547
Well, I probably just made
the biggest mistake of my life;

689
00:33:57,747 --> 00:33:59,647
put my husband
and my kids through hell,

690
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:03,147
at the very least lost
a thousand-dollar deposit.

691
00:34:03,747 --> 00:34:05,047
Go ahead. Shoot.

692
00:34:06,647 --> 00:34:08,347
You ever heard
of chlorahydrofromaid?

693
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:10,347
Why? You want to borrow some?

694
00:34:12,447 --> 00:34:14,647
Turns out Gary worked
as a lab tech last summer.

695
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:18,947
He and David Channing were involved in a 
toxicity study of this chlorahydrofromaid.

696
00:34:19,347 --> 00:34:20,247
Okay.

697
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:22,547
Apparently, it's some kind
of industrial byproduct.

698
00:34:22,547 --> 00:34:24,347
Anyway, a small legion of rats
gave their lives

699
00:34:24,347 --> 00:34:25,847
to demonstrate
that the stuff's harmless.

700
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:27,547
Here's the weird part.

701
00:34:28,347 --> 00:34:29,847
The company that commissioned
the lab test

702
00:34:29,847 --> 00:34:33,847
is some outfit called, uh...
"Bunford Properties."

703
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,047
Bunford Properties--
your developer.

704
00:34:36,447 --> 00:34:38,947
Apparently, they found
trace amounts of this
chlorahydrofromaid

705
00:34:38,947 --> 00:34:41,047
in the wells they dug
to supply water to the place.

706
00:34:41,047 --> 00:34:42,147
Oh, my God.

707
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,347
Not to worry, 'cause like
I said, according to the tests

708
00:34:44,347 --> 00:34:45,747
that Gary and his friend
David Channing conducted,

709
00:34:45,747 --> 00:34:47,047
the stuff's completely harmless.

710
00:34:48,647 --> 00:34:50,447
Of course, nobody asked
the three dead rats

711
00:34:50,447 --> 00:34:51,647
I found in Gary's car.

712
00:34:51,847 --> 00:34:53,047
They might feel differently.

713
00:34:56,447 --> 00:34:57,547
Of course.

714
00:34:58,447 --> 00:35:01,347
It was never our old house
that was going
to make Marie sick.

715
00:35:02,247 --> 00:35:03,447
It's Willow Elm.

716
00:35:03,947 --> 00:35:05,647
Willow Elm is the answer.

717
00:35:06,047 --> 00:35:08,047
I was just asking
the wrong question.

718
00:35:09,847 --> 00:35:10,747
Mr. Bunford?

719
00:35:11,447 --> 00:35:12,247
Yes?

720
00:35:12,847 --> 00:35:14,747
Mr. Bunford,
my name is Manuel Devalos.

721
00:35:14,747 --> 00:35:16,647
I'm the District Attorney
for the city of Phoenix.

722
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:19,147
This is Detective Lee Scanlon
with Phoenix PD.

723
00:35:19,147 --> 00:35:21,047
Do you mind if we ask you
a couple of questions?

724
00:35:21,447 --> 00:35:22,247
About?

725
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:24,047
Chlorahydrofromaid.

726
00:35:24,847 --> 00:35:25,947
Well, what about it?

727
00:35:26,247 --> 00:35:27,147
It's old news.

728
00:35:28,147 --> 00:35:30,947
Apparently some small quantities
had seeped into the aquifer--

729
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:32,847
the water supply.

730
00:35:32,847 --> 00:35:33,647
We did some testing.

731
00:35:34,347 --> 00:35:37,647
The quantities and the chemical
itself, for that matter,
pose no threat to anyone.

732
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:39,747
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

733
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:41,647
Good Lord,
what is that?

734
00:35:42,147 --> 00:35:42,947
Rats.

735
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:44,547
Yeah, I can see that.

736
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:47,747
Rats that, according
to the city medical examiner,

737
00:35:47,747 --> 00:35:50,747
suffered from abnormally
low white blood cell counts.

738
00:35:50,947 --> 00:35:53,347
Their platelets
and red blood cells
were destroyed.

739
00:35:53,347 --> 00:35:54,447
They died of leukemia,

740
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:58,947
leukemia brought on by exposure
to massive doses of chlorahydrofromaid.

741
00:36:00,147 --> 00:36:01,247
Says you.

742
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:04,947
Thanks for stopping by,
gentlemen.

743
00:36:05,447 --> 00:36:06,747
If you have
any further questions,

744
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,147
feel free to call
my attorney.

745
00:36:09,047 --> 00:36:10,647
Does the name Gary Albright
ring a bell?

746
00:36:13,847 --> 00:36:17,047
What part of "I'm not answering
your questions"

747
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:18,147
did you not hear?

748
00:36:18,147 --> 00:36:20,247
Mr. Albright was found dead
in his apartment.

749
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:22,747
We're investigating it
as a possible homicide.

750
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,347
ok.
He was one
of the technicians

751
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:25,747
that performed
the tests you ordered

752
00:36:26,147 --> 00:36:28,247
That jar was found
among his personal effects.

753
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:30,247
Gentlemen...

754
00:36:30,247 --> 00:36:33,547
We suspect that these rats died
as a part of the test

755
00:36:33,547 --> 00:36:35,547
that your company ordered
on its water supply.

756
00:36:35,547 --> 00:36:38,447
We think that when
Mr. Albright and his
lab partner David Channg

757
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:42,347
came to you and told you that
chlorahydrofromaid tested as a carcinogen,

758
00:36:42,347 --> 00:36:45,047
you prevailed on them to go back
and run the tests again.

759
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:48,447
We're guessing you paid them
to get the results you wanted,

760
00:36:48,447 --> 00:36:50,547
the results you needed
to get permission to build here.

761
00:36:50,547 --> 00:36:52,647
Honestly, I've never met
this Gary.

762
00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:54,547
I wouldn't know him
if I fell over him.

763
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:58,147
Yeah. Well, we think
Gary had a change of heart.

764
00:36:58,547 --> 00:37:00,747
We think he decided
he couldn't live
with what he'd done.

765
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:03,247
He decided to come forward

766
00:37:03,247 --> 00:37:06,247
with proof of the cover-up
he perpetrated.

767
00:37:06,447 --> 00:37:09,847
Hey, folks, I'm just
finishing up a tour
with these gentlemen.

768
00:37:09,847 --> 00:37:11,247
If you'll step
inside the model home,

769
00:37:11,247 --> 00:37:12,347
I'll be with you
in a minute.

770
00:37:17,047 --> 00:37:18,547
So what are you saying?
I killed this fellow?

771
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:24,947
Gentlemen, if you have a problem
with the veracity
of the lab's findings,

772
00:37:24,947 --> 00:37:26,747
then you need
to investigate the lab.

773
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:29,747
I'm just a guy
who builds and sells houses.

774
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:32,647
And really,
that's what I need to do.

775
00:37:37,747 --> 00:37:39,947
Thanks, man.
I'll see you next week.

776
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:41,647
Yeah, same time,
same place?
Yeah.

777
00:37:41,847 --> 00:37:43,047
Hey, Channing,
what you doing?

778
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:51,047
We need to talk.

779
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:53,947
Sure, sure.

780
00:37:54,347 --> 00:37:56,247
I'm, I'm happy to talk.

781
00:37:57,547 --> 00:38:00,547
I don't know what
there really is to talk about.

782
00:38:00,547 --> 00:38:02,547
Take it easy.
I'm not here as a cop.

783
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,047
Just think of me
as a concerned friend.

784
00:38:12,247 --> 00:38:13,047
You okay?

785
00:38:13,747 --> 00:38:14,947
Yeah, I am.
I'm fine.

786
00:38:14,947 --> 00:38:16,947
'Cause, uh, when you came
to see me the other day,

787
00:38:16,947 --> 00:38:18,347
I though you looked
kind of anxious.

788
00:38:18,747 --> 00:38:20,947
Then, now you actually look
kind of sick,

789
00:38:22,547 --> 00:38:23,747
you know?
You sick, Channing?

790
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:26,247
No.

791
00:38:26,647 --> 00:38:27,747
Maybe you need
to get high.

792
00:38:28,947 --> 00:38:30,147
What are you
talking about?

793
00:38:30,347 --> 00:38:31,647
I don't think
it was the job

794
00:38:31,647 --> 00:38:33,447
that brought you and Gary
together last summer.

795
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:36,747
I think it might have been
something else.

796
00:38:38,447 --> 00:38:40,747
No? You feel good?

797
00:38:42,147 --> 00:38:42,947
Great.

798
00:38:44,547 --> 00:38:45,547
Let's go down
to headquarters

799
00:38:45,547 --> 00:38:46,547
and talk for
a couple hours.

800
00:38:47,047 --> 00:38:47,947
Whoa, Detective, wait.

801
00:38:48,747 --> 00:38:51,047
What are you doing?!
What are you doing?

802
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:52,947
What are you doing?

803
00:38:53,847 --> 00:38:55,447
Assaulting a peace officer,
Channing?

804
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:56,747
I barely touched you!

805
00:38:59,947 --> 00:39:01,447
You're jonesing harder
than I thought.

806
00:39:03,847 --> 00:39:06,547
You, you said...
you were here as a friend.

807
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:09,747
I am...

808
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:11,847
a friend of Gary's.

809
00:39:16,347 --> 00:39:17,447
Okay, okay.

810
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:18,747
You're right.
You're right.

811
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:20,147
I have a problem.
I do,

812
00:39:21,047 --> 00:39:23,347
but I need, I need help,
Detective, you know?

813
00:39:23,347 --> 00:39:25,447
I need real help.

814
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:28,747
I want to get clean,
you know?

815
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:29,947
I want to kick it...

816
00:39:31,447 --> 00:39:32,847
and I want to help you try...

817
00:39:33,047 --> 00:39:34,047
try to figure out

818
00:39:34,147 --> 00:39:37,147
whatever really happened
to Gary, I swear.

819
00:39:37,547 --> 00:39:39,047
You just...

820
00:39:41,247 --> 00:39:42,347
just unlock these cuffs.

821
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:45,847
Let me have just a little taste
to make me right,

822
00:39:45,847 --> 00:39:46,647
and then we can...

823
00:39:48,047 --> 00:39:50,147
you know, I can get right,
and then we can talk.

824
00:39:50,547 --> 00:39:51,747
That's good, Channing.

825
00:39:53,147 --> 00:39:54,547
You sound really sincere.

826
00:39:54,547 --> 00:39:55,447
Let me just, uh...

827
00:39:58,147 --> 00:40:00,247
No, I can't seem
to find that key.

828
00:40:01,047 --> 00:40:02,747
No, I guess I'll have to call
over to headquarters

829
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:04,247
and get them to send over
another one.

830
00:40:05,647 --> 00:40:07,147
Looks like we could be here
for a while.

831
00:40:09,047 --> 00:40:10,147
You can't do that.

832
00:40:10,147 --> 00:40:11,847
That... it's kidnapping.

833
00:40:11,847 --> 00:40:13,247
How long can you
hold out, do you know?

834
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:15,047
I bet it's not as long as you think.

835
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:17,347
Look at you. You're a mess.

836
00:40:19,347 --> 00:40:20,147
Well...

837
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:24,247
if I tell you
what you want to hear then...?

838
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:26,147
You'll find that I can be
a very understanding man.

839
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:28,247
Compassionate, even.

840
00:40:28,947 --> 00:40:31,947
After all,
I've been there myself.

841
00:40:37,547 --> 00:40:38,847
So why'd you kill him?

842
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:44,747
Hmm? 'Cause he was calling me?

843
00:40:46,047 --> 00:40:47,347
'Cause he was starting
to realize

844
00:40:47,347 --> 00:40:48,547
that taking the money
from Bunford

845
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:49,447
wasn't going to make up for

846
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:53,047
all the innocent people that
were going to get sick and die?

847
00:40:54,747 --> 00:40:55,847
All the children...

848
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,847
Take your time.
I'm in no hurry.

849
00:41:05,647 --> 00:41:07,847
Girls, breakfast!

850
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:10,447
All right,
listen to this.

851
00:41:11,047 --> 00:41:13,647
"Convicted developer
Albert Bunford faces

852
00:41:13,647 --> 00:41:16,347
a total of 245 years
of prison time."

853
00:41:16,947 --> 00:41:17,747
Whoo!

854
00:41:18,847 --> 00:41:19,947
True confessions?

855
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:22,547
I love this house,

856
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:23,747
but I was actually starting

857
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,447
to get a little excited
about moving.

858
00:41:25,747 --> 00:41:26,747
Oh, really?

859
00:41:26,947 --> 00:41:29,347
Yeah, something about a bathroom
with two sinks,

860
00:41:29,547 --> 00:41:31,847
a community pool...

861
00:41:33,347 --> 00:41:35,447
Maybe in our next life, huh?

862
00:41:35,447 --> 00:41:37,347
<i>"Our next life." I like that.</i>

863
00:41:38,447 --> 00:41:40,647
You get an extra piece
of French toast.

864
00:41:40,647 --> 00:41:41,447
Yum!

865
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:43,147
Girls!

866
00:41:45,347 --> 00:41:47,347
It looks like
a Frankenstein bear.

867
00:41:47,347 --> 00:41:48,147
No, it doesn't.

868
00:41:48,347 --> 00:41:50,747
I got some needle and thread
and stitched Mr. Snookie.

869
00:41:50,947 --> 00:41:53,247
JOE:
Look at that
excellent job, Ariel.

870
