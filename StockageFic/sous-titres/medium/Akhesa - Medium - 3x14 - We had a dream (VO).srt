3
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,099
Yeah, I-I'd rather not talk
about how I know

4
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,700
that a plane is going to crash
ten days before it happens.

5
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,199
I'm sorry,
I don't have a location.

6
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,300
I just know that they're
headed towards Las Vegas.

7
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,399
I was just hoping that
we could do something,

8
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,700
reach out to the people who
are going to be on this plane,

9
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,400
stop them
from taking this trip.

10
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,100
The man flying the plane
is named Ken.

11
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,900
I'm sorry, that's
all I have: Ken.

12
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,500
He's middle-aged.

13
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,599
Uh, he's a white man,
he's medium build.

14
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,799
Oh, and there's
a passenger.

15
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,200
Uh, a woman: Amy.

16
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,199
She's younger.

17
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,000
Mid-30s, I'm guessing.

18
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,099
Well, I did call the FAA.

19
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,700
They suggested I call you.

20
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,200
Yes, I realize what the Department
of Homeland Security does.

21
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:21,600
(mouthing)

22
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,399
Yes, I'm an American citizen.

23
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,500
Hang up.

24
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,399
Yes, that's my phone number.

25
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,900
Hang up.

26
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,300
Yes, that's my address.

27
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,700
Allison, put down the phone.

28
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,200
Hey, I'm not going to tell you
if that's my Social or not.

29
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,600
Department of
Homeland Security?Are you insane?

30
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,900
What would you have me do?

31
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,500
Your boss is going to be here
to pick you up in 20 minutes.

32
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,300
I got up half an hour early
to get the girls to school.

33
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,499
How about you take a break
from getting us put on

34
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,300
the national watch
list and get washed and dressed?

35
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
<i>ALLISON:
And then you get to the part of the
conversation where they go,</i>

36
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,200
"And how do you know this?"

37
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,400
And they either say it like they're talking
to Chicken Little or...

38
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,300
(groaning):
Osama bin Allison.

39
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,000
(chuckles)

40
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,000
The 28th?

41
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,300
Heading towards
Las Vegas? Okay.

42
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,700
What do you mean, "Okay"?

43
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,299
Well, I was thinking you could
sit with a sketch artist,

44
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,600
develop a likeness of the
people you saw in the plane.

45
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,700
We could distribute the
sketches around the country--

46
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,200
regional airports, aircraft
maintenance facilities--

47
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,400
say they were "people of
interest" in an investigation.

48
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,999
There's no guarantee anyone
will actually recognize them,

49
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,100
but at least
it's something.

50
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,000
Thank you.

51
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,300
(sighing):
I.D.'s out.

52
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,800
Prison gate's up ahead.

53
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,699
<i>ALLISON:
So what is it we're doing here?</i>

54
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,300
I thought you'd
never ask.

55
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,900
Supposedly, your friend Sonny
Troyer wants to confess to yet another murder.

56
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,299
Sonny Troy is
not my friend.

57
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,900
I've never even
met the man.

58
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,099
Nonetheless, you and I
know it was the information

59
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,700
you gave us that led to
his capture and conviction.

60
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,399
It just seemed prudent
to have you here.

61
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,200
Is there a problem?

62
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,199
I guess not.

63
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,300
You know, I was only able
to tell you what I did

64
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
because, for some reason,

65
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Mr. Troyer and I began having the same dreams--

66
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,100
dreams about women--

67
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,100
alone, isolated,
in some kind of trouble.

68
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,600
Women he would then attack
and kill.

69
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,199
He threatened me,
he threatened my family.

70
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
It wasn't pleasant.

71
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,400
It's not something
that I'm anxious to repeat.

72
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,400
Allison, the man is
serving three life terms.

73
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,399
There's no reason to believe
he can do you any harm

74
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,199
from behind bars, but
if you're uncomfortable,

75
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,900
I can certainly
handle this myself.

76
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,200
(lock buzzes)

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,900
Sonny Troyer.

78
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,600
Mr. Troyer, perhaps you
remember me from your trial.

79
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,100
I'm Manuel Devalos,
the city District Attorney.

80
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,200
You asked for
this meeting.

81
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,200
(inhales)

82
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,100
(laughs quietly)

83
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,200
Sorry, forgive me.

84
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,700
"To sleep,
perchance to dream."

85
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,600
I wouldn't want
to miss anything.

86
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sure you've
had plenty of time to dream in the past
nine months or so.

87
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,300
Suspect you'll
have plenty of time in the months and
years to come.

88
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,600
(laughing):
I hope so.

89
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,300
I'm sorry;
I didn't catch your name.

90
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Allison.

91
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,600
Sorry?

92
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,000
(exhales)

93
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Allison.
Would that be Dubois?

94
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,300
We finally meet.

95
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,899
<i>And how are your dreams,
Allison Dubois?</i>

96
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,600
That's none of
your business.

97
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,400
I'm sorry you feel that way.

98
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,600
I don't get too many visitors,

99
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,100
much less ones with whom
I have so much in common.

100
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,000
Does he know
our little secret?

101
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,700
I still see them--

102
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,500
all those helpless women,
in over their heads,

103
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,500
hoping someone will find them
and rescue them.

104
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,500
That must be very...
frustrating for you.

105
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,800
I can dream.

106
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,200
(clears throat)

107
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,300
Will your attorney be joining us?

108
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,800
I have no legal representation.

109
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,299
After I was given my third
consecutive life sentence,

110
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,900
it all seemed
rather pointless.

111
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,100
Then let's get
on with it.

112
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,399
You have something
to confess and we don't have
a lot of time.

113
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,199
You sound nervous,
Mr. District Attorney.

114
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,800
I can hear it
in your voice.

115
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,199
Born in Arizona,
but when you're anxious,

116
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,500
a little bit of your parents'
native Jalisco kicks in.

117
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,799
Hard consonants, switching
your "I"s and "E"s.

118
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,400
I remember noticing that
during your cross-examination.

119
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,700
You're wasting my time.

120
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,400
Debra Waldman.

121
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Ah...

122
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,800
You remember Debra Waldman.

123
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,400
Been missing... ah...
three years now, right?

124
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,500
Spent her last night on Earth at a border bar a lot
of Mesa Uni students visit for the cheap booze.

125
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,100
She was pretty drunk
when her friends ditched her.

126
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,000
By the time she
wandered into the desert

127
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,699
lost and confused,
filled with fear,

128
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,700
I was already having
dreams about her.

129
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,000
When she passed out,

130
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,100
I was already two-thirds
of the way there.

131
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,400
Okay.

132
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,900
Where's her body?

133
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,600
Raised in Oklahoma?

134
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,700
I've never heard
your voice in person before,

135
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,600
but there it is, diphthongization
of short vowels and all.

136
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,300
Mr. Troyer...

137
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,800
The state of Texas has filed
papers for my extradition.

138
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,999
Seems they found the remains
of a young woman

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,599
in a grain silo
outside Aberdeen.

140
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Something about my DNA
being present in several of the pockets
between her teeth and gums.

141
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,699
Those forensic scientists,

142
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,599
those Crime Scene Investigators,

143
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
they all have
such lurid imaginations.

144
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,400
(slams chains on table)

145
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,399
Nonetheless,
the state of Texas seems

146
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,600
to actually enjoy executing
fellows like me.

147
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I would prefer to stay here,
in comfortable Arizona,

148
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,200
serve my three life sentences,
and dream.

149
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,700
If you file papers
to block their extradition,

150
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,499
I will provide you
with precise directions

151
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,600
to the location of
Ms. Waldman's remains.

152
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,600
It was nice to finally
make your acquaintance.

153
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,400
Deputy Mayor Lynn
DiNovi, please.

154
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Saure, I'll hold.

155
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,799
Something
bothering you?

156
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,700
It's weird.

157
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,500
When Sonny Troyer was active,
when he was killing,

158
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,000
I dreamt the same
dreams he had.

159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,599
I never dreamt
of Debbie Waldman.

160
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,599
Of course, that was before
I worked in your office,

161
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,000
before I took
everything that I felt,everything I dreamt
so seriously.

162
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,200
Are you suggesting
he's lying?

163
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,299
To be honest with you,

164
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,899
the bell that's going off
loudest in my head

165
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,799
has to do with the plane crash
ten days from...

166
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Lynn. Manuel.

167
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,500
Hold onto your hat.

168
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,199
Sonny Troyer, the serial killer,

169
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,599
just confessed to
the killing of Debra Waldman,

170
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,000
the co-ed who's been
missing since 2004.

171
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,799
No, he won't tell us
where the body is

172
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,399
until we get Texas to waive his
extradition on another matter,

173
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,700
which is why I'm calling.

174
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,200
I need you to tell the mayor
to call the governor.

175
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,500
I need the governor
to get on the phone with our friends in Texas

176
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,000
(chuckles):
Hey.

177
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,400
If it isn't our favorite
candidate for city council.

178
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,000
To what do I
owe this honor?

179
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,100
It's done.

180
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,899
Excuse me?

181
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,700
Late last night, the
Governor called the Mayor.

182
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,700
Texas is gonna waive their
rights to Sonny Troyer,

183
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,800
at least for
the moment.

184
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,499
At least long enough
for you to see

185
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,200
if there really is a body
where he says there is.

186
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,700
So let me ask you...
Whew!

187
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,500
how sure are you that what this guy's
telling you is the truth?

188
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,200
Are you pretty confident
about this body?

189
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,499
What's he gain
by lying?

190
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,800
If he tells us where to go
and there's no body there,

191
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,400
he's still in prison for
the rest of his life,

192
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,500
and Texas is still free
to take him and fry him.

193
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,100
The mayor might want to leak
something to the press

194
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,100
about an ongoing investigation
into the disappearance of a young college co-ed,

195
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
an investigation
spearheaded by His Honor.

196
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,300
You. Me.

197
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,499
Well, that wouldn't
be a bad thing

198
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,200
for someone running for,
say, city council, would it?

199
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,800
Not a bad thing for
a district attorney either.

200
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,000
(knocking on door)

201
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,900
<i>DEVALOS:

202

Hey.

203
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,000
I got a fistful of messages
here from you.

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,500
Are you stalking me?
I've been trying
to get in to see you all day.

205
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,700
It's the 27th.
Okay.

206
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,799
Tomorrow's the day that small
plane is supposed to go down.

207
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,399
I was wondering if you got
any calls from anyone,

208
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,500
off our sketches--
any persons of interest.

209
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,400
Not a one.

210
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,200
Well, maybe that's good news.

211
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,400
Maybe it's gonna happen
on the 28th of another month.

212
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,900
Maybe we can still stop it.

213
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,900
Maybe.

214
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,000
I, uh...

215
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,000
Sorry.

216
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,100
<i>JOE:
It's been over a week, Allison.</i>

217
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,499
You done
everything you can.

218
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,399
Well, that's the thing.

219
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,500
I really haven't been
able to do anything, really.

220
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,500
Well, maybe you're
not supposed to.

221
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,200
What is that
supposed to mean?

222
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,900
Well, I don't know.

223
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,500
I don't subscribe to the
Psychic Friends Network.

224
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,399
But if the modus operandi
you have to buy into

225
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,800
is that there's actually
a plan for all this,

226
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,100
then perhaps this once
you're not part of it.

227
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,499
Perhaps this
particular message,

228
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,500
this particular dream, ended
up in your inbox by mistake.

229
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,600
What are you saying, these
people are supposed to die?

230
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,100
Maybe that's the
plan for them.

231
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,300
Maybe they're
horrible people.

232
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,899
No.

233
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,500
I don't believe that.

234
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,300
(siren blaring)

235
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,000
(fire roaring)

236
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,700
MAN (over P.A.):
All prisoners, step away from the plane!

237
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,700
All prisoners,
step away from the plane!

238
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,000
All prisoners in the yard

239
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,700
will immediately
return to the block.

240
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,800
All prisoners in the yard
will immediately...

241
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,300
Oh, my God. He knows about the plane.

242
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,099
(chuckles):
Hey, early bird.

243
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,299
It's not even 7:00.

244
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,300
Don't you carry
your cell phone?
It's in my office.

245
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,399
I called your house.

246
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,899
Yeah, I've been here
since quarter to 6:00

247
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,699
working in the law library,
putting together the thing for the judge tomorrow.

248
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,700
I know why
Sonny Troyer confessed to killing
Debbie Waldman.

249
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,099
He dreamt about the
same plane crash I did.

250
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,100
Not this again, Allison.

251
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,799
I've already done everything
I possibly can.

252
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,000
It is going to happen.

253
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,100
That plane is gonna crash
into the Arizona State Prison.

254
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,100
This morning, today, 8:19.

255
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,800
Sonny Troyer is gonna
make it his business to be out on the prison
yard when it does.

256
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,899
Think about it:
He dreamt the dream,

257
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,899
he recognized
the location,

258
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,900
he realized that if
he was sent to Texas,

259
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,499
he would miss his
chance at escape,

260
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,599
so he came up with the
whole confession thing.

261
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,900
Has he told you the
location of the body yet?

262
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,499
Today. I'm scheduled to go out
to the prison this afternoon.

263
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
He's not even gonna be
there this afternoon.

264
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,400
Please.

265
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,899
We have to call
the prison.

266
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,400
We have to find
the warden.

267
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,099
What do I tell him?

268
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,100
Anything. Anything
that'll keep Sonny Troyer off of that
prison yard till after 8:19.

269
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,500
(line ringing over speakerphone)

270
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,999
ECKLER:
This is Warden Eckler.

271
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,999
Warden Eckler-- I'm
sorry to disturb you at such an early
hour, sir.

272
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,499
This is District Attorney
Manuel Devalos over in Phoenix.

273
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,800
I have you on speakerphone.

274
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,199
Morning, Mr. District Attorney.

275
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,299
Just getting into my office.
How can I...?

276
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,800
Sir, some investigators working
under me have just come into

277
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,100
some highly credible information
about a possible

278
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,799
large-scale escape attempt
at your prison.

279
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,799
Are you serious?

280
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,899
I most certainly am.

281
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,900
To the best of our knowledge,
the plan is set to happen just after
8:00 this morning.

282
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,700
I'm not at liberty to
discuss the particulars,

283
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,999
but it is crucial that you clear
the prison yard immediately

284
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,300
and initiate
an immediate lockdown.

285
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,299
And specifically,
most specifically,

286
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,499
that you isolate
prisoner number 16309,

287
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,000
Sonny Troyer.

288
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,900
A pretty tall order, counselor.

289
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,500
It's already quarter past 7:00
on my watch.

290
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,300
But I think we can
make this happen.

291
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,399
(laughs)

292
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,700
Much appreciated, sir.

293
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,100
Yeah, well, you owe me
a steak dinner next time I'm over your way.

294
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,999
(jet engines roaring)

295
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,800
What the hell?

296
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,400
Hang on a second.

297
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,200
(engines roaring louder)

298
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,000
(explosion,
then alarm sounding)

299
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,400

300
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,600
Come on...

301
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,900
(speed dialing beeps)

302
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,100

TV ANCHORMAN:
And the hunt continues tonight for Sonny Troyer,

307
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,199
the notorious serial killer who escaped from
Arizona State Prison today

308
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,200
after a freakish
private jet crash that killed two.

309
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,200
A statewide manhunt
is currently underway,

310
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,200
with federal marshals
coordinating their efforts

311
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,600
with local authorities,
setting up roadblocks

312
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,199
and monitoring
all airports and...

313
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200

314
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,000
Yes, thank you.
Thank you very much.

315
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,299
That was the FAA.

316
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,199
The pilot was
a Ken Androsky,

317
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,899
and his passenger was
his girlfriend Amy Chandler.

318
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,199
They took off from
a private airstrip
in El Paso;

319
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,600
they didn't file a flight plan.

320
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,500
El Paso, Texas--an hour ahead of us.

321
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,900
There's no way
you could have known.

322
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,599
He knew.
Sonny Troyer knew.

323
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,999
He heard it in their accents.

324
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,500
(knocking)

325
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,300
Hey, I just went through Sonny
Troyer's cell with the dogs.

326
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,300
No luck at all.

327
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,700
Apparently, he doused everything
with rubbing alcohol--

328
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,700
his clothes, the linens,
even his mattress.

329
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,899
Even switched clothes with
one of the other inmates

330
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,500
before he went out to
the yard this morning.

331
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,300
This isn't what you'd
call a spontaneous trip.

332
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,600

00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,400
(yawns):
I don't know.

347
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,000
But if he
caught a break,

348
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,399
he could be halfway
to Mexico by now.

349
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,399
No.

350
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,200
He's somewhere asleep.

351
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Excuse me?

352
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,300
Think about it.

353
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,100
He's just spent
nine frustrating months

354
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,400
waiting for an opportunity
to do what he does best:

355
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,500
to prey on women in peril.

356
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,900
And to what do we
owe this optimism?

357
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,600
You should have seen the library of books
that they pulled out of his cell.

358
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,100
This is not a man
waiting to retire.

359
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,600
So they close
off the border,

360
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,200
make it impossible
for him to leave.

361
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,300
No-- he's gonna do
what he's built to do,and he's gonna do it
right here in Phoenix...

362
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,899
soon as he can
get some sleep;

363
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,900
soon as he can
close his eyes.

364
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,700
Closing eyes.

365
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,900
Getting rest.

366
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,600
Oh, my goodness.

367
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,900
I think this fellow
may be onto something.

368
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,300
(sighs)

369
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,700
Hey...

370
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,300
That's not funny.

371
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,500
I'm still talking.

372
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,100
(groans)

373
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Hey.

374
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,999
Fine, play dead.

375
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,800
You won't be
playing for long.

376
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,400
(sighs)

377
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,300
(bell dings)

378
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,600
(elevator clanks)

379
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,600
Oh, geez.

380
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,500
Lord...

381
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,300
Please.

382
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,100
Hello...?!

383
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,400
Hello!

384
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,500
Can anyone hear me?!

385
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,900
Help!

386
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,999
Help...!

387
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,800
(gasps)

388
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,000
(groaning):
Allison.

389
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,599
There's a woman--
she's trapped in an elevator,

390
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,300
She's calling for help.
What?

391
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,299
(sighs)
It's those dreams.

392
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,999
The same one that Sonny Troyer's
having, I'm having them again.I have to call Scanlon.

393
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,100
No. Honey...

394
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,900
Even if he's having the same
dreams, which you don't know,

395
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,800
he's a wanted man.

396
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,200
His face is on
every newscast;

397
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,900
every cop in town
is looking for him.

398
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,400
I mean, do you really
think that he's gonna

399
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,200
stick his neck out to kill
this woman in an elevator?

400
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,700
Do you want to take
that chance?

401
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,000
I have to get her out
of there.
But out of where?

402
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,700
Do you know, do you know
where the elevator is

403
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,900
or the building's
address?

404
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,299
(cat meowing)

405
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,600
WOMAN:
Quincy. Quincy.

406
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,900
Get down here, Quincy.

407
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,500
Quincy!

408
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,400
(grunting)

409
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,500
(screaming)

410
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,700
Hello!

411
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,800
Is anyone there?!

412
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Hello!

413
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,299
Is anyone there?!

414
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,100
(gasping)

415
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,000
There's a girl somewhere.

416
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,600
Her-- she was trying
to get her cat out of the tree.
She just fell.

417
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,100
Okay.

418
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,400
All right. Were there...

419
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,500
Were there any, uh,

420
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,600
like, landmarks
or buildings?

421
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,200
It was the woods.

422
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
It was dark.
There were trees.

423
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,599
So it's like a state
park or something?

424
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,500
I don't know.
I just know her damn cat's name is Quincy.
That's all I know.

425
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,900
Hmm. Okay.

426
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,400
Well, wait-- now,
that's good, right?

427
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,900
Because that means that
that's all that he
knows, too, right?

428
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,200
(moans)

429
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,700
(ring tone playing)

430
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,300
Hello?

431
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,899
TROYER:
God... I'm guessing you having as much trouble
sleeping as I am.

432
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,700
One dream after the other.

433
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,200
I guess when it rains
it pours, huh?

434
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,200
How did you get this number?

435
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,000
First that poor woman
in the elevator. Then that girl
with the kitty cat.

436
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,600
Did you find her
as attractive as I did?

437
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,100
She was kind of fetching,
wasn't she?

438
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,200
Now there's a word you don't
hear too much anymore--
It's him.

439
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,199
"Fetching."
Call Scanlon.

440
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,500
Anyway, none of that is why I really called.

441
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,500
I really called to talk
about our situation.

442
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,300
What are you talking about?

443
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,799
"Our situation"?

444
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,700
Well, I mean... we're kind of at a standoff here,
don't you think?

445
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,200
I have a dream.
You have a dream.

446
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,200
It's gonna make it
really hard for me to do the things that I have to do.

447
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,999
Not to mention cops everywhere,
my mug shot on the TV.

448
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I had to pay a homeless guy $25 bucks to buy me
this cell phone.

449
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,400
I just don't think
we can go on this way.

450
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,599
Hey, did you have the dream
about that blonde mom

451
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,900
boo-hooing to her husband

452
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,200
because she just couldn't
figure out her dreams?

453
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,300
Did you have that one, too,
or was that just me?

454
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,700
I don't know where
the elevator lady is...or the cat girl.

455
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,500
But that blonde mom?

456
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,300
I've been to her house.

457
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,900
I don't know what else
to suggest.

458
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,800
He does know where you live.

459
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,799
I mean, uh...
I could move you and your family
to a hotel, but...

460
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,000
that presents all sorts
of other problems.

461
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,500
I really do think
the best solution is just to hunker down
right here.

462
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,000
We'll keep a visible police
presence outside your home.

463
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,199
Wait a second.
I got work.

464
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,900
The girls have school.

465
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Work? How're you
gonna go to work?

466
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,900
I can barely keep
my eyes open.

467
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,400
It's 5:40 in the morning,
we've been up since 2:00.

468
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,699
How are you going
to go to work?

469
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,499
I don't really have
a choice, Allison.

470
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,999
I don't think work is a problem.

471
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,800
With all due respect,
you're not really our killer's type.

472
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,600
But the girls,

473
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,600
Allison--
I would just feel better

474
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,100
if they were all in one place.

475
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,600
(elevator bell dings)

476
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,100
Good morning.

477
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,900
I beg to differ.

478
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,999
I got a call at
4:00 this morning

479
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,900
<i>from a reporter on
the Arizona Observer.</i>

480
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,399
This reporter claims you
actually phoned officials

481
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,400
<i>at Arizona State Prison to warn
them about that jet crash 90 seconds before it happened.</i>

482
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Before the plane crashed?

483
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That, uh... doesn't
make any sense.

484
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,600
I don't know-- a plane
falls from the sky,

485
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,100
I'm sure there's an enormous
amount of panic, confusion...

486
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,099
Why was your office circulating sketches
of "persons of interest"

487
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,600
to airports and aircraft
maintenance facilities a week
before the crash--

488
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
sketches that look
exactly like the victims?

489
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,599
I'm sorry.

490
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,299
I can't help but think
that someone is confusing

491
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,000
two separate investigations.

492
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,299
If we coincidentally
sent out sketches

493
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,699
that happened to look like
the two victims of the crash...

494
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,500
Manuel... based on
our conversation,

495
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,800
my boss, your boss,
the mayor...

496
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,400
called our governor.

497
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,299
Our governor called Texas.

498
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,400
Now reporters are calling me.

499
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,400
<i>I will need answers.</i>

500
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,600
Do you have any idea
the blame storm that's
going to rain down on all of us

501
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,399
if
there's reason to believe we knew, but
didn't do everything we could

502
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,100
to prevent the escape
of a serial killer?

503
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,100
Once we've captured
Mr. Troyer, and we will,once he's brought to justice,

504
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,400
I'm sure all these questions will be answered
to everyone's satisfaction.

505
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,600
I hope you're right.

506
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,900
(phone ringing)

507
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,900
Oh... Ariel?Honey, can you,
uh, get the phone and mute the TV?

508
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,700
(TV mutes)

509
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,300
Thanks. Hello?

510
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,700
SCANLON:
Get any sleep yet?

511
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,500
You're joking, right?

512
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,000
Do you think any of the cops outside would like
to do a little babysitting?

513
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,100
Yeah, I don't think
our boy Troyer got all that much rest either.

514
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,599
I'm here waiting
for the coroner to come help clean up the mess
he made last night.

515
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,400
What?!

516
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,900
Was it a nurse in an elevator?

517
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,600
Or was it a girl in the woods?

518
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,000
A woman in a Dumpster.

519
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,799
Seems like she got in a fight
with her boyfriend

520
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,600
while they were driving
to Flagstaff.

521
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,199
He left her to calm down
at a rest stop here on the Intestate.

522
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,100
He says that was around
4:00 in the morning.

523
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,599
Ring a bell?
No, how could it?

524
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,200
I've been awake
since Troyer called.

525
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,800
And he knew I would be.

526
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,900
Excuse me?

527
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,000
Damn, he's smart.

528
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,100
He wasn't really threatening me.

529
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,600
He was frightening me.

530
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,900
He wanted to be sure
that I would stay awake,

531
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,300
to be sure that I couldn't
dream his dreams.

532
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,800
<i>WOMAN:
Hey roomie, it's me.</i>

533
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,600
Waiting for some stuff
to print out. What are you doing?

534
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,499
I know. It's all over the news.

535
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,100
I wish they'd just catch
the son of a bitch already.

536
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,000
You're damn right, it's scary.

537
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,300
Look, just pour yourself one of your Bloody Marys
and get to bed.

538
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,600
You'll forget
he's even out there.

539
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,100
No vodka?!

540
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,399
Tell you what:
I'll call the liquor store

541
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,000
and have them deliver,
but by the time I get home,

542
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,600
you better have one
mixed for me, too.

543
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,300
(laughing)

544
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Night.

545
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,199
(auto-dial beeping)

546
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,800
Hello, Christopher's Liquors?

547
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,700
Yeah, order for delivery.

548
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,300
Claire Williams,
1701 Pike's Way.

549
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,600
(door closing)

550
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,900
(clattering in distance)

551
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,100
Detective Lee Scanlon please.

552
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,100
There's Sleeping Beauty.
Hey, Mom,

553
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,799
I ordered pizza.
What time is it?

554
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,799
Um, it's a little after 7:00.
Have you looked out the window?

555
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,399
There's, like, a brigade
of cops out there.

556
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,399
Our neighbor's yelling
at them 'cause there's
nowhere to park.

557
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,300
Wait... Lee?

558
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,000
Hey, I had another dream.
There's a woman.

559
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,600
Her name is Claire Williams.

560
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,000
She's stuck on the roof of the Phoenix East
buding downtown.

561
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,900
She locked herself out
and she feels trapped and vulnerable.

562
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,300
Phoenix East. Got it.

563
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,100
(helicopter whirring)

564
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,900
OFFICER (P.A.):
Claire Williams!
Claire Williams!

565
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,100
This is the Phoenix
Metro Police.

566
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,799
Move away from the door.

567
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,700
Move away from the door.
(crashing)

568
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,900
(screams)

569
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,399
Okay, look-- I know we're not
supposed to smoke on the roof.

570
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,500
I know we're not supposed
to smoke on the roof.

571
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,900
Don't shoot me.

572
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,400
Don't shoot me

573
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,899
<i>SCANLON:
Her name's Claire Williams.</i>

574
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,599
She's a statistical
analyst in data

575
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
reconfiguration--
whatever the hell that is.

576
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,700
CLAIRE:
Detective Scanlon?

577
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,600
Yes, Ms. Williams?
Hi.

578
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,300
I just wanted
to thank you.

579
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,500
And... well, would
it be possible for me to get a ride home?

580
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,900
My roommate's not
answering the phone.

581
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,599
I can't figure it.
I know she's home.

582
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
I just talked to
her an hour ago.

583
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,000
Yeah, I'll have
an officer run you home.
What's your address?

584
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:11,000
1701 Pike's Way.

585
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
How did you know that?
Your roommate...

586
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,900
She was alone and she was
afraid, wasn't she?

587
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,800
OFFICER:
Clear!

588
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,100
OFFICER 2:
Detective!

589
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,100
We're bored.

590
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
Yeah.
We want to go out.

591
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,200
Yeah.
We're sick of being stuck
in the house.
Yeah.

592
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,500
<i>ALLISON:
e, we have a problem.</i>

593
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,500
I'm looking at
a potential mutiny here.

594
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,800
It's Saturday and the girls
are going stir-crazy.

595
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,100
Joe wants to take them up to his sister in Flagstaff
for the weekend.

596
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,300
I think it's a good idea.

597
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,300
Flagstaff, huh?

598
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,000
I'll stay here
on Dream Patrol.

599
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,499
The house is surrounded
by police;

600
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,200
I feel completely safe.

601
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,500
The girls are just
at the end of their rope.

602
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,600
Okay. I'll have one of my guys
follow them up there.

603
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,500
I'll give the Flagstaff PD
a shout,make sure
they're on alert as well.

604
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,600
I'll call you like a
hured, 150 times a day.

605
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,300
You call me
as much as you like.

606
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,000
Okay.

607
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,500
You got it?

608
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,599
(dog barking in distance)

609
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,300
Bridge, honey?

610
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Daddy wants to go!

611
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,700
BRIDGETTE:
I'm looking
for something!

612
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,300
She's looking for her
baseball bat and batting helmet

613
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,399
in case she has to beat up
the serial killer guy.

614
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,200
Honey, you don't
need that!

615
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,700
BRIDGETTE:
Yes, I do!

616
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,100
Hurry up and
catch this guy, Mom,

617
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,900
so we can
come back home.

618
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,300
I'll try.

619
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,100
(smooching)

620
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,800
Bridgette!

621
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,700
(indistinct police radio
communication in distance)

622
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,100
(yawning)

623
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
TV REPORTER:
...hospital for
sick children.

624
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,800
Tracy Hooper was given
the liver

625
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,300
of a nine-year-old
accident victim,

626
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,000
in a four-hour operation.

627
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,700
Hooper is in critical
but stable condition,

628
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,500
normal after
such an operation.

629
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,100
Her condition will be
monitored for 72 hours

630
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,300
to see if there's any sign
of organ rejection.

631
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,700
Shoot me and
I'll never forgive you.

632
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,400
(sighs)

633
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,500
Are you crazy?

634
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,500
Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

635
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,999
How did you get
in here?

636
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,100
You left me a key.

637
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,499
Remember?
The night you broke it off?

638
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,800
Left me sitting in
that restaurant...
I don't want to talk about this.

639
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,199
Not tonight. Not now.

640
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,899
I said things,
you said things, but this is not the time.

641
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,700
There's a maniac out there,
killing women,

642
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,999
making an ass out of me.

643
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,300
You wanna spend the night,
that's fine.

644
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,000
But I have no interest
in talking.

645
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,999
Put your ego back in your pants.

646
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,700
I have no interest in staying.

647
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,999
I'm here to get some
questions answered.
I just said...

648
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,899
Not about us, about why a woman
who works part-time

649
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,400
for the District Attorney's
Office is being given 24-hour police protection.

650
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,100
I'm talking about
Allison Dubois.

651
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,100
Okay.

652
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,200
That's your answer?

653
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
"Okay?"

654
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,899
Are you aware of that the
message Sonny Troyer wrote

655
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,399
in blood last night:
"Wrong Roommate Allison"?

656
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,300
Yeah.

657
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,700
I was there.

658
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,100
What's the connection between
this woman and Sonny Troyer?

659
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,200
I am not at liberty
to discuss this with you.

660
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,700
Let me paint a
picture for you.

661
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,100
There's a journalist that
calls me four times a day.

662
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,000
She thinks the District
Attorney's Office

663
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,500
somehow knew that Sonny Troyer was going
to escape from that penitentiary ahead of time.

664
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,699
I'm starting to
believe her.

665
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,699
And you can bet

666
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,300
I'm not the only
one she's calling.

667
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,600
This thing is getting ready to
blow up in everybody's face.

668
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,500
The DA, me, you.

669
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,300
Lynn, listen to me.

670
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,500
Leave... this... be.

671
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,400
We're going
to catch this guy.

672
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,900
It'll make all
the questions go away. It always does.

673
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,800
No. Lee...

674
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,100
Tell me what's going on.

675
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,800
Let me help you.

676
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,900
I would tell you...

677
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,200
...but the truth is
you'd never believe it.

678
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,700
Hell, there are days
I don't even believe it.

679
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,200
(engine revving)

680
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,100
(tires squealing)

681
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,200
(tires squealing)

682
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,000
(sighs)

683
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,700
(keypad beeping)

684
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,000
Joe, it's me.

685
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,800
Hi.

686
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
Is something wrong?

687
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,799
It's the middle of the night.

688
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,999
I'm watching out the window;

689
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,900
it looks like all the
police cars are leaving.

690
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,300
There's only one left...

691
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,000
and now he's gone.

692
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,399
Hang up. Call Scanlon. Maybe it's good news.

693
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,600
Maybe they caught the guy.

694
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,200
(line ringing)

695
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,000
(gasping):
Lee.

696
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,200
Yeah. Who am I talking to?

697
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,000
Lee! It's me. It's Allison.

698
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,399
They took all the police away.

699
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,500
What is going on?
I'm here all by myself.

700
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,399
Damn it--
she promised me she wouldn't do anything until the morning.

701
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,200
What are you talking about?

702
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,299
That Deputy Mayor.

703
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,599
She was asking a lot
of questions.

704
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,000
I wouldn't tell her
what she wanted to know.

705
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,599
She was threatening
to pull the plug on everything

706
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,900
but I thought for sure she was
gonna give me till the morning.

707
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,400
I'll be right there.I'm coming right over.

708
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,500
yeah Hey.

709
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,300
There's, uh, been a mix up.

710
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,700
They took the police cars away,

711
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,699
but it's okay 'cause
Scanlon's coming over.

712
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,200
He's going to be here
in 20 minutes.

713
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,500
All right, I'm waking the kids,
we're coming home.

714
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,499
No, don't do that.

715
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,500
Honestly. You're hours away. He'll be here in a few minutes.

716
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,700
I don't care.

717
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,100
No, please don't.

718
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,599
Please, I don't...I'm upset and frightened enough.

719
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,200
That'll just make me feel worse.

720
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,100
Joe? Joe?

721
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:33,899
Lee!

722
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,100
My power went down.
My phones are out.

723
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,200
Damn it.

724
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,400
Allison, calm down.

725
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,500
Calm down.

726
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,399
There's a pretty strong wind
off the desert.

727
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,900
It may have just...
I'm scared.

728
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,999
I know.

729
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,799
I'm still maybe ten,
12 minutes away.

730
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,000
Just hang tight.

731
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,300
Double-check your windows
and doors and by the time you're done,
I'll be there.

732
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,000
I had a dream.

733
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,099
(screams)

734
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,300
And you were in it.

735
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,800
(pounding on door) Electric company! 
Heard you might be having a problem!

736
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,299
Allison, be a dear
and open the door.

737
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,800
We don't want to
disturb the neighbors.

738
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,200
Lee! He's here!

739
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
Allison, I'm still
ten minutes away.

740
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
Ten minutes!

741
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,900
You were ten minutes away
ten minutes ago!

742
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,400
I'm doing 90.

743
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,700
(screams)

744
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,100
He's trying to smash his way in!

745
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,799
Lee?

746
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,100
Are you there?

747
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,800
(pounding on glass)

748
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,300
Lee?

749
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,100
(gunfire)

750
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,600
(sighs)
You okay?

751
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,400
Oh...

752
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,700
(distant siren wailing)

753
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,600
SCANLON:
I'm sorry.

754
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,200
We're sorry.

755
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,800
That whole thing hinged
on you not knowing.

756
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,000
You had to be alone; feel
vulnerable, terrified.

757
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,700
I get it.

758
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,099
DINOVI:
The police never
really left.

759
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,000
You were really never
in any danger.

760
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,600
So, I bet you're full
of questions.

761
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,800
Nothing that can't wait.

762
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,099
I'm going to go home.

763
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,500
Let you two talk.

764
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,200
Go ahead,
go say good-bye to her.

765
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,100
Hey...

766
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,600
Thank you.

767
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,400
I don't think I would have
gotten to this on my own.

768
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,400
You're welcome.

769
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,700
So how about my key?

770
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,800
You want it back?

771
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,200
Nah. It's okay.

772
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,900
I'll change the lock.

773
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
No, you won't.

774
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
If you ever pull anything
like that again...

775
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,499
Are you kidding?

776
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,800
This is my new technique
for solving murder sprees.

777
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,699
Scare the wits out
of Allison Dubois

778
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,600
and then, uh, bring
in the firing squad.

779
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,099
Can't argue
with success.

780
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,600
How dead is he?

781
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,300
Real dead.

782
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,200
Very dead.

783
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,600
You should sleep
just fine.

784
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,400
Just because he's dead?

785
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,600
No, it doesn't work
that way.

786
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:54,900
