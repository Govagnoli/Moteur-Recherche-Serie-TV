00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,270
"Bankruptcy!"

2
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,840
"Don't worry kids, Everything will be
okay.And I should know I'm paychic!"

3
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,920
"Knock, knock"

4
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,530
"It's District Attorney Van Dyke!"

5
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,710
"Your mortgage is due!Pay it
now or vacate the premises!"

6
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,090
"Help has arrived.It's
Attorney Larry Watt!"

7
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,950
"My hero!"

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,370
Do you know it's not even 6:00?

12
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,930
Sorry. I couldn't sleep.

13
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,990
This whole meeting at the bank about the
home equity loan has got me all wound up.

14
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,190
I just wanted to make sure
I had everything in orR.

15
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,120
Yeah. It's got me a little crazy, too.

16
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,890
I just had a dream about larry watt
saving our home from an evil banker.

17
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,580
Larry watt?

18
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,540
The callous and unprincipled
defense attorney?

19
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,560
I thought you hated larry watt.

20
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,720
Well, I don't hate him. Not him.

21
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,940
Just everything that he stands for.

22
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,810
Ask me who the evil banker was.

23
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,790
District attorney van dyke.

24
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,750
That really was a nightmare.

25
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,860
So, if larry watt was the hero, and van
dyke was the villain, what role did I play?

26
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,770
Well, you were strangely absent.

27
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,660
I guess that's what I get for
leaving you in bed by yourself.

28
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,490
You got an e-mail.

29
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,550
Great.

30
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,060
Whoever it is, whatever they're
selling-- we can't afford it.

31
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,830
It's devalos. He's back.

32
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,650
He's going to open his own practice.

33
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,490
He thinks he might
have some work for me.

34
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,020
Ariel: You look nice.

35
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,250
Thank you.

36
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,490
Job interview?

37
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,100
No. A thing at the bank.

38
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,660
Just trying to borrow some
money against the house.

39
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,790
Just till we can figure out what's next.

40
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,530
I don't know if you've noticed, but I haven't
really asked you or mom for my allowance in a while.

41
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,140
No. We appreciate that, and I know...

42
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,050
I know you've been using your-your
baby-sitting money for school lunch.

43
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,960
- And it's fine.
- Sweetie, just as soon as we...

44
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,620
no. I know.

45
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,370
It's just that...

46
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,230
there's this store at the mall.

47
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,970
It's a makeup store, and a bunch of us
were going to go over after school today.

48
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,640
And then I realized that I don't have
money for the bus or to buy anything.

49
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,140
And I was just wondering...

50
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,960
how much money are we talking about?

51
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,920
Well, they have these cases with brushes and
makeup and everything, and it would be about $30.

52
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,490
You need money today? Now?

53
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,130
Ariel, I...

54
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,350
sweetie, if I had $30 to give you...

55
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,000
how much is the bus?
It's-it's two dollars each way?

56
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,430
- Never mind, dad.
- No, sweetie.Hold on.

57
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,740
- Dad, it's okay.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

58
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,690
Here's four dollars.
Here's four dollars.

59
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,260
Ariel. Ariel, honey!

60
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,420
I'll see you tonight.

61
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,720
No, no, no, no.

62
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,720
This won't do.

63
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,020
What won't do?

64
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,470
We have a problem. You're
betterdressed than I am.

65
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,460
If you don't open that
door, I'm going to kick it down.

66
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,610
You've been warned.

67
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,800
Hey, stranger.

68
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,430
There is nothing more I would lovein this
world than to have youcome work for me, 

69
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,360
but at the moment, I don't have
any clients, much less any work.

70
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,090
No. What I meant in
mye-mail was, a, um...

71
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,220
colleague of minewas asking about you.

72
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,510
Wanted to know if I would
make anintroduction for him.

73
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,510
A defense attorney?

74
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,790
I've never workedfor a defense attorney.

75
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,580
Interesting case.

76
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,950
Man's accused ofkilling his wife.

77
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,700
Well, what do you think?
Do you think he did it?

78
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,480
I have no idea.

79
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,890
Does it matter? It paysamerican money.

80
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,780
Joe: The guy at the bank didn't
seem to think there'dbe a problem.

81
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,590
It's just a question of
pushingthe paperwork through.

82
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,800
He thought we'd have a
checkin a week, week and a half.

83
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,760
Well, this mustbe our lucky day, 'cause
this meeting, or this job interview--

84
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,900
which is I guesswhat it is-- shouldn't
take me morethan a couple of hours.

85
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,010
I should bedone by 9:00.

86
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,010
- Wish me luck.
- Luck.

87
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,500
Girls? Come on!

88
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,680
Dinner's onthe table.

89
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,530
Don't give yourdaddy a hard time.

90
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,660
Oh, make sure thatmarie uses her napkin.

91
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,770
Don't be afraid toask ariel for help.

92
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,750
ariel?

93
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,150
dad, don't you knock?

94
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,130
I did knock.

95
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,020
Yeah, well, you're supposedto
wait until I say come in.

96
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,140
I would have, but thenthere's this whole
issue of life expectancyto deal with.

97
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,620
Besides, dinner'son the table.

98
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,580
Your mom wentoff to a meeting.

99
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,930
I could use yourhelp with marie.

100
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,480
What's this?

101
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,940
Uh, I told you, we were going to the mall.

102
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,300
We went to that store, and I bought
that caseI was telling you about.

103
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,910
Do you mind if I
ask, uh, how did you do that?

104
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,500
What do you mean?

105
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,800
I just bought it.

106
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,450
Don't worry. I used my own money.

107
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,520
Uh, but this morning, you made it
sound like you didn'thave any money.

108
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,670
Yeah. Well...

109
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,630
turns out I did.

110
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,130
Who wantsdinner?

111
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,700
hello!

112
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,580
Hello?

113
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,820
Hello!

114
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,510
Hello?

115
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,250
Is anybody here?

116
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,810
Man:In here.

117
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,560
larry watt for the defense.

118
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,960
It's okay, mrs. Dubois.

119
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,380
I'm not goingto bite.

120
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,880
It's been a long time.

121
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,110
I recognizedyour pitchfork.

122
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,160
okay, I'm confused.

123
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,020
Was it you whowanted to see
me? These aren't your offices.

124
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,370
Yeah, well, don't beangry with manuel.

125
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,410
If I had asked youto come to my
offices, would you have takenthe meeting?

126
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,800
Yeah.

127
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,780
No. My client, john edgemont, uses this
firm for his corporateand civil matters.

128
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,830
Oh, I see.

129
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,440
But whenever he's accused
ofkilling his wife, he hires you.

130
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,680
allison, I knowyou're in a tight spot.

131
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,410
And I also know, more than most, just how
effective you can bein a trial situation.

132
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,190
I'm prepared to offer youa
lot of money to assist me.

133
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,690
Assist you with what?

134
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,890
My client's on trial for murder.

135
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,640
Okay. Did he do it?

136
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,250
I don't believe he did, no.

137
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,290
How can you be so sure?

138
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,060
Becauseyou'll meet him, and
you'll tell me, or maybe you won'T.

139
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,260
Maybe you'll be justlike the rest
of us and help mount a great defense

140
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,930
because you're being paidto do it.

141
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,470
Think it over, but think quickly.

142
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,980
Bank opens at 8:00.

143
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,860
You know, he was kind of nice in
an oily, larry watt kind of way.

144
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,030
Ah, that's the soundof the money talking.

145
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,550
What, you don't like the
soundof the money talking?

146
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,830
I love the sound of the money talking.

147
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,130
I just hope thatyou're going to be okay
with everything youhave to do to earn it.

148
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,920
how much money do you
thinkariel makes baby-sitting?

149
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,160
I don't know. Why?

150
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,460
Well, she wentto the mall today and
spent, like, $30at this makeup store.

151
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,690
And when I asked herabout it, she insisted
that she did it withher own money.

152
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,970
Okay. If that's what she
told you, what's the problem?

153
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,760
I don't know. There
probablyis no problem.

154
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:22,130
I mean I know thiswhole intuition thing
is more your neck ofthe woods than mine, 

155
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,010
but I just gotthis feeling.

156
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,690
Dad, can you pull
overand let me off here?

157
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,410
What are youtalking about?
The school'sa block ay.

158
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,410
I-I want to walk. Please.

159
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,090
Okay.

160
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,870
Thanks.

161
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,220
Can I help you?

162
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,670
My name's allisondubois.

163
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,500
Uh, larry wattis expecting me.

164
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,460
One moment.

165
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,660
Mrs. Dubois?

166
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,300
Attorney watt wanted me to ask youto
please meet him in the conference room.

167
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,270
John, I'm just trying to help you.

168
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,200
No.

169
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,620
You're tryingto stage manage an event
that does not needto be stage managed.

170
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,860
I did not killmy wife...

171
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,930
therefore these
courtroomtheatrics are unnecessary.

172
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,230
Uh, they, they just told me
to come straightin here.

173
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,260
If this is a bad time...

174
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:50,440
no, no, no, no, no. This, this
isa perfect time.

175
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,340
Allison dubois, john edgemont.

176
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,980
John, this is the womanI told you about.

177
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,010
Used to work forthe district attorney.

178
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,970
YeS. I'm very awareof
who mrs. Dubois is.

179
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,530
I think she's going to prove to be veryuseful to
us, particularly this morningwith jury selection.

180
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,790
Nice to meet you.

181
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,570
Nice to meet you.

182
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,020
You shookhis hand.

183
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,220
Tell me what you feel.
Tell me what you see.

184
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,310
nothing. I don't see
anything.I don't feel anything.

185
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,310
Precisely!

186
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,230
Wait! Wait.

187
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,780
I'm confused. What's going on?

188
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,050
Apparently mr. Watt must think that by shaking
your handI'm able to tellwhether you're...

189
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,760
if I'm a man who couldkill his wife?

190
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,130
So? What's the verdict?

191
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,580
There is no verdict.

192
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,440
Doesn't workthat way ever.

193
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,540
At least it didn't today.

194
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,380
So you have no opinionabout me?

195
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,730
You seem like a nice man.

196
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,180
I have trouble imagining
youhurting anyone.

197
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,940
I appreciate that.

198
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,420
Mind if I ask youropinion
about something?

199
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,070
No, of course not.

200
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,870
My, uh...

201
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,430
my daughters, myra and chloe, they're
sitting in the, in the waiting area...

202
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,520
I think I passed them on the way in.

203
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,960
My attorney believes
thatit would be helpful

204
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,190
if they were both presentin the
courtroom during jury selection.Do you?

205
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,540
Don't be naive, john.

206
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,790
We're picking jurors.

207
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,470
These are the people who
aregoing to decide your fate.

208
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,720
We need to paint a picturefor
them of who you are.

209
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,890
Me, personally?

210
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,340
I already like you better when
I seethat you have children.

211
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,450
That the childrenare in your life.

212
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,630
That they're in the
courtroomsitting there with you.

213
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,400
Look, it goeswithout saying, the district attorney is
goingto do whatever it takes to win that jury over.

214
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,140
But I could certainlyunderstand as a parent why
you wouldn't want yourchildren to hear the things

215
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,300
that are going to be
saidin that courtroom.

216
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,810
I'm not worriedabout my oldest.

217
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,140
Myra's 18.

218
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,890
I just...

219
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,220
chloe is a few years
younger, and frankly...

220
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,790
she's what people politelycall
"mentally challenged."

221
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,130
Now, I'm, I'm, I'm not even sure that
she'll understandwhat's going on.

222
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:07,780
And I'm afraid in the courtroom, with the
judge, and the lawyers, and all the loud talking...

223
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:12,510
that, that she couldbecome frightened.
She, she can be very excitable.

224
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,350
We're fighting foryour life here, john.

225
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,520
It is my job to encourage you to
use every weaponat your disposal.

226
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,770
Yeah, well...

227
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,020
my childrenaren't weapons.

228
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:30,260
I think I'm going to
askmyra to take chloe home.

229
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,330
NoW.

230
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,550
I'll be right back.

231
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,480
I was scared to deaththat I was going to meet him
and something was goingto scream out "murderer!"

232
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,640
But it wasthe complete opposite.

233
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,370
What is so amusing?

234
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,270
Nothing. I justthink it's funny
that you not onlywant to get paid, 

235
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,790
but you want to be onthe
side of right as well.

236
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,030
Oh, doesn't everybody?

237
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,740
Well, honestly noteveryone
has that luxury.

238
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,750
Well, right now I do.

239
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,830
So please, stop rainingon my parade.

240
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,160
Yes, ma'am.

241
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:10,060
All rain will herebypromptly
cease and desist.

242
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,410
It better.

243
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,140
are you laughing?

244
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,350
I'm just saying let's keepthings
in perspective, that's all.

245
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,890
By "keeping it in perspective, " you really mean"don't
bite the hand that's paying our bills", don't you?

246
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,130
What do youwant me to say?

247
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,580
As little as possible.

248
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,870
Look, when I workedat aerodytech, I did
a lot of thingsthat I didn't want to do, 

249
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,050
but that was the job and they were
paying mea salary to get it done.

250
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,110
I did those thingsbecause
I needed the money.

251
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,290
Because we neededthe money.

252
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
He is a murderer!

253
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,070
He murdered his wifein cold blood.

254
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,020
- You think.
- I know.

255
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,270
Well, I don't knowwhat to tell you.

256
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,750
'Cause last night you
"knew"that he was innocent.

257
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,090
No, but you're right, you're
right. All right, let'S...

258
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,950
you know, we'll givelarry
watt back his money.

259
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,860
We'll live differently.

260
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,800
We'll sell the house, we'll
move to a commune.

261
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,840
Eat onlywhat we grow.

262
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:08,650
We'll homeschool the kids.

263
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,750
I didn't sayI was quitting.

264
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,050
I didn't say I wasgiving the
money back. I just said...

265
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,990
that this changes it for me.

266
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,620
Yesterday it felt good.

267
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:22,770
But I guess feeling good
isnot a perk I get this time.

268
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,940
I'm going to drive the kidsto school.

269
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,790
I'll see youthis afternoon.

270
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,940
See you this afternoon.

271
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,150
Hey, uh, I'm ariel dubois'father.

272
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,040
I was wondering if I
couldtalk to you for a second.

273
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,330
Watt:You're late!

274
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,740
Not a terribly
auspiciousstart, mrs. Dubois.

275
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,540
I'm really sorry.

276
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,920
I should have been
herein plenty of time.

277
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:25,090
I forgot that I didn't havemy official id anymore
and that they took awaymy permanent parking space.

278
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,150
They made me go upto the third...

279
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,070
the judge took
ill, there's no court today.

280
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,240
I don't know why, but somehow I expected
you would have known thatbefore anyone else.

281
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,630
Anyway, my boy had an epiphanylast night.

282
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,900
He wants to testifyin his own defense.

283
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,740
I told him I thoughtit was ill-advised.

284
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,160
Of course, that onlyhardened his resolve.

285
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:50,490
I thought we'd havea little rehearsal, a
little, uh, mock trialthis afternoon.

286
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,250
Uh, attorney watt, I have to
talk to youabout john edgemont.

287
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,370
No, actually. No.You don'T.

288
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,980
You're not the only one with good
instinctsaround here, mrs. Dubois.

289
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,290
I have a hunch that you're goingto
tell me something about my client, 

290
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,760
something about our client
that I don't need to hear.

291
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,760
Well, I think you do.

292
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,250
I had a dream about himlast night.

293
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,490
Oh, I'm sureyou did.

294
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,690
But whatever you dreamtdoesn't change the
fact that there's a manaccused of murder

295
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,410
who needs someoneto mount his defense.

296
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,530
And speaking for myself
only, I'd like to be that someone.

297
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,360
The pay is goodand the
work is interesting.

298
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,370
And if you'd like to bethat someone, too, 

299
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,010
you change the subjectand
change it quickly

300
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,860
because whatever you thinkabout me you should
know that I'm notkeen on suborning perjury.

301
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,810
Now, john edgemont wants to tell
his sideof the story to that jury

302
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:39,460
and you know as well as I do that i can't
put him on thestand if I know he's guilty.

303
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,430
good.

304
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,270
I'm glad we
seeeye-to-eye on this.

305
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,690
We'll reconvene at 2:00.

306
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,110
You might want to show uparound 1:45.

307
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,270
Parking can be trickyat that building.

308
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,280
So you admit that you and yourwife
fought on the nightof her death.

309
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,030
Yes, we had an argument.

310
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,660
What about?

311
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,610
The children. My children.

312
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:20,430
myra's a, a freshmanat college and she's
taken to coming and goingas she pleases.

313
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,430
Stacey thought we shouldlay down
some ground rules about her hours.

314
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,890
Or insist thatshe move to campus.

315
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,020
Stay in a dorm.

316
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,840
And you disagreed?

317
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,180
I like having my
childrenwith me at home.

318
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,550
I just...

319
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,600
I like it.

320
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,370
And is myrathe only thing that
you two disagreedabout that night?

321
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,580
No.

322
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,900
No, we also hada
conversation about chloe.

323
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,950
What about chloe?

324
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,950
She requires a lot
ofattention, doesn't she?

325
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,590
Yes, chloe requiresconstant supervision.

326
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,030
We have nurses, but it's, it's, uh...

327
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,570
it's always difficultto have...

328
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,770
a child with special needsat homE.

329
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:05,100
stacey didn't have a lotof patience.

330
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,980
She felt that we shouldput
chloe in a facility.

331
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,020
In an institution?

332
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,950
That's right.

333
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,550
And again, you...

334
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,260
you didn't agree.

335
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,700
I was fairly adamant that bothmy
children should live at home.

336
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,810
Watt:W-wait a second.

337
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,360
Let's talk about this word"adamant."

338
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,270
It conjures up allsorts of images.

339
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,370
It makes you sound intractable.

340
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,080
Let me makesomething clear here.

341
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,820
No one is asking you to lie.

342
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,580
But it would be veryhelpful to our cause
if somehow this jurywas made to believe that

343
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:38,280
the ideaof sending chloe away was something
you might havereluctantly considered.

344
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,110
Myra:But it's just not true.

345
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,300
My father would neverput
chloe in an institution.

346
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,460
We're a family. She
belongs at home with us.

347
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,730
I know that, ms.
Edgemont, and I admire it.

348
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,490
But without lying aboutany of
the material facts of this case, 

349
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,320
we have to paint a picturefor
the jury on who your father is.

350
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,890
We want it to be impossiblefor them to
imagine that he's done thishorrible thing.

351
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,110
We're fighting foryour
father's life here.

352
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,040
She understands.

353
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,930
We both understand.

354
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,810
I'll, um...

355
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,130
I'll try to avoidusing
the word "adamant."

356
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,710
All right, fine.

357
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,290
All right, so...

358
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,710
that's a lot of stress on
a new marriage, isn't it?

359
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,700
Yes.

360
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,160
That night, you fought.

361
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,620
Yes, we did.

362
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,770
And you claimthat your wife went
out for a driveto clear her head.

363
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,410
That's what she did.

364
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,900
And you didn't worry whenshe
failed to return home?

365
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,200
Of course I worried.

366
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,620
And the longer she
wasgone, the more I worried.

367
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,710
I couldn't raise heron the cell
phone, we just had an argument.

368
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,310
I mean, I guess I was
hoping shewas cooling down.

369
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,830
I guess I was hopingshe'd call me.

370
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,540
And finally, just before
4:00, I called the police.

371
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,560
it's done.

372
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,740
Okay. Good.

373
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:33,010
Really? I'm not so sure.

374
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:37,340
Dad, you know whatwould've
happened if you told themthe truth.

375
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,410
They would'vetaken chloe away.

376
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,270
To an institution.

377
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,610
Or worse, prison.

378
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,720
It's not likewe had a choice.

379
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,400
Now, you promisedmother.

380
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,970
You promised you
wouldnever send chloe away.

381
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,300
I know. I know I did.

382
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,910
But myra, this isn't the
first timeshe's hurt someone.

383
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,480
But dad, you knowit isn't intentional.

384
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,400
She isn't capable.

385
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,680
She just getsfrustrated. She
doesn't knowher own strength.

386
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:10,470
I know. I know that.

387
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,090
Stacey wasn'tthe best stepmother.

388
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,080
And she wasn't the best wife.

389
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,640
But she didn't deserveto die like that.

390
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,530
Nobody does.

391
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:29,490
For the last time, mr. Edgemont, did
you or did younot kill your wife?

392
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,000
No. I did not.

393
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:43,910
Look, dad, mom's homefrom work
exactly when we got home from school.

394
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,130
Hi, mom, how was your day? Mine was good.

395
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,840
We had sloppy joes for lunch.

396
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:55,370
I never actually hada sloppy joe before.

397
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,080
Except I reallylike them.

398
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,780
This kid named bretttold me the sandwich
was actually madeout of the guts of

399
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,640
some guy named joewho's really sloppy.

400
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,380
But I don't believe that.
Do you believe that, mom?

401
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,690
Both:I really need to speak with you.

402
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,730
Allison: You first.

403
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,910
No, you first.

404
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,970
It turns out thatjohn
edgemont is not guilty.

405
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,440
Not? Excellent.You sure?

406
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,220
Did you discover thisbefore
you gave back the money?

407
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,330
Answer the secondquestion first.

408
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,570
Okay, I told you I was
notgiving the money back.

409
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,830
I told you I was not quitting.

410
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,420
Okay, calm down.

411
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:27,300
Boy, you seem awfully upsetfor somebody
who just eight hours agowas worried

412
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:32,590
they might be toilingaway for
someone who committeda horrible crime.

413
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,170
He's covering for his daughter.

414
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,870
His daughter killed his wife?

415
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,940
There's somethingwrong with her.

416
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,630
She's got braindamage of some sort.

417
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,690
I only saw her once, briefly.

418
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,390
She seemed sweet.

419
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,310
Apparently, she's gota real a temper.

420
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,500
What are you going to do?

421
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,310
The district attorney
ispushing for the death penalty.

422
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,580
I feel like I haveto tell somebody.

423
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,850
Maybe watt, maybethe district attorney.

424
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,280
And then I think, "no, I can't do
that. This man is choosingto do this."

425
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,390
He's not being framed.
He's not being coerced.

426
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,190
This is a father tryingto
protect his daughter.

427
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,570
Now, what was your thing?

428
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,920
Oh, no, that's not fair.

429
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,090
I can't possiblyfollow your dilemma.

430
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,180
What are you talking about?

431
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,960
You've got this, like, seven course
meal of a moral quandary going on, 

432
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,770
I've got this little fast
food burger of a problem.

433
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,950
- It's okay, it'll wait.
- Joe.

434
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,610
I know how arielis getting her money.

435
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,980
I thought we alreadyhad
this conversation.

436
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,890
Yes, we did, but then I took herto school yesterday
and she's hanging aroundwith these older kids.

437
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,210
You know, and your imaginationjust
starts to go crazy.

438
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,300
Then I realized I just hadto be forthright
about it. I mean, I had to do something.

439
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,870
What are you talkingabout
"do something"?

440
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,530
I don't know, just grab
the bull by the horns.

441
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,510
Anyway, I saw the older girlthat
ariel was talking to the other day, 

442
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,980
and then I justfigured, "what the hell?"

443
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,350
And then you...

444
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,200
Nothing. I didn't do anything.

445
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,960
Hey, you should seethe look on your face.

446
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,220
Well, you must havedone something.

447
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,010
Nothing. I give you my word.

448
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,070
I didn't do anything.

449
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,780
I just went up, I
startedtalking to this girl.

450
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,670
Oh, no.

451
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,830
Oh, yes, how else do you think that I could
figure out howariel was getting her money?

452
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,450
You can't do that.

453
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,090
You can't go behind herback
and talk to her friends.

454
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,920
It wasn't behind her back.

455
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,440
It was in broad daylight in
front of a wholebunch of people.

456
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,060
She just didn't happento be one of them.

457
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,980
This is terrible.

458
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,090
You haven't even heard...

459
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,060
okay, fine. Tell me.

460
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,860
She's doing readings.

461
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,950
Just this one girl, far as I can tell.

462
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,490
And she seemed pretty impressedwith
whatever ariel was telling her, 

463
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,340
which isprobably a pretty good thing
considering she charged her $50.

464
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,470
I guess with all the attentionthat
you got in the press last year, 

465
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,240
it's just a matter of time
before somebody sought her out.

466
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,510
I can't deal withthis right now.

467
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,710
You don't haveto deal
with it. I'll deal with it.

468
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,600
Well, you definitelycan't deal with it.

469
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,820
The minute that she finds out
how you got this information, 

470
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,130
everything you say is
justgoing to fall on deaf ears.

471
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,660
Oh, yeah? How is it thatyou
know this and I don'T.

472
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,120
Well, I don't know, joe.

473
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,610
How is it I knowthis and you don't?

474
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,350
hello?

475
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,590
You know, I don't get that.

476
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,130
Excuse me?

477
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,850
I don't get that either.

478
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,080
You can't tellwho's on the phone, you
leave your bag behindafter a meeting, 

479
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,910
and you call yourselfa big time psychic?

480
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,310
Mr. Watt.

481
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,710
Ooh, maybe I spoke too soon.

482
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,570
So what do you want
me to do with this bag?

483
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,440
There's not much here, just
a pad and some pens.

484
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,420
You want me to hold
onto it until tomorrow?

485
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,640
Where are you?

486
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:14,670
I'm at the coffee shop across
the street from where we were, why?

487
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,690
Thanks for waiting.

488
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,890
So what is it?

489
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,290
What is what?

490
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,290
you didn't come all the way hereto
get back a pad and some pens.

491
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,940
You're dyingto tell me something.

492
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,080
Just remember our agreement.
I don't wantto know if it has...

493
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,050
no, it's not that.

494
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,880
On the contrary.

495
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,840
Now, I'm certainhe didn't do it.

496
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,750
So ask me who diD.

497
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,030
Do I care?

498
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,450
It's chloe.

499
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,100
His youngest.

500
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,560
And edgemont knows.

501
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,110
Well, that's not
thereaction I was expecting.

502
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,290
What do you mean?

503
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,990
Why am I not surprised?

504
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:18,810
About six years ago I got a callfrom edgemont's civil
attorneys that my office neededto write up a, uh...

505
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,500
umhea waiver of liability.

506
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,930
A live-in nurse that johnand his first wife
employed attacked in her bedr he middle of the night.

507
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,960
Sound asleep, someone starts beating
the crap out ofher with a baseball bat.

508
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:34,160
Couple of broken
ribs, contusions tface...

509
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:37,870
a hundred thousand dollarsand
that waiver later...

510
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,220
hethe problem just... disappeared.

511
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,060
Chloe?

512
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,930
So what do we do now?

513
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,380
What do you mean?

514
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,550
This doesn't change anything.

515
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,530
Our client is still innocent.

516
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,410
And we have to continueto defend him.

517
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,740
But isn't the bestway to defend him, to
prove to the courtwho really did it?

518
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,980
Well, that's one strategy.

519
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:04,610
But I'm fairly certainit's a strategy
to which our clientswould take exception.

520
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,540
Listen, let'S...

521
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,530
let's get out of here, you know?

522
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,430
We have to finishpicking
a jury tomorrow.

523
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,950
I can't do that.

524
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,070
Can't do what?

525
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,840
I can't be a party to this.

526
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,030
Look, I know you think
whathe's doing is honorable, 

527
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,030
but she is obviously
dangerous.She needs help.

528
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,720
And she's not going to getit as long as everyone
is convinced that herfather is the guilty party.

529
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,580
We have to tell someone.

530
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,840
Tell them what?

531
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,400
I mean no disrespect.

532
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,960
Where did you get this?

533
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,950
A fortune cookie? Burning bush?

534
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,220
I'm not the D.A.I'm a gun for hire.

535
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,760
And john edgemont didn't hire
meto turn his daughter in.

536
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:49,400
Yeah, well, I'm a gunfor hire, too, and
I didn't sign on for this.

537
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:52,020
Look, don't be foolish.

538
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,210
The guy is payingyou good
money. And he is innocent.

539
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:00,420
This is as close as you getto a straight
flush in the defense attorneybusiness.

540
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,520
Listen, I don't want tohave
to go back to my client

541
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:07,470
and explain to him why one dayyou're
on the team and the next day you're off.

542
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,120
Please, let's just get
through this trial.

543
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,940
And then after our
clientis declared innocent, 

544
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,370
you want to be a girl scoutand go tell
someone about his daughter, go ahead.

545
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,960
But for now, take his
moneyand pay your bills.

546
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,470
Go buy yourself something.

547
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Buy your kids something.

548
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,010
I mean, isn't that
reallywhat this is all about?

549
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,960
Taking care of your kids?

550
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,390
'Cause that's allI'm trying to do.

551
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,820
And that's all you'retrying to do.

552
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,670
Hell, that's allhe's trying to do.

553
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,120
You smelllike shampoo.

554
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,540
I'm sorry.

555
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,950
Thank you forfeeding
everybody and bathingeverybody.

556
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,690
They're my kids, too, you know.

557
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,840
Well, I know that.

558
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,960
did you talk to ariel?

559
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,150
You asked me not to.

560
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,140
Do you have any ideawhat
you're going to say to her?

561
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:30,220
Well, actually, larrywatt gave me an idea.

562
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:33,120
And it's $50. Take it.

563
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,030
What's it for?

564
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,820
it's for yourfriend, marcy.

565
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:42,150
I want you to give herher money back.

566
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,360
Daddy told you?

567
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,580
But I don't get it.

568
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,560
Why are you giving this to me?

569
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,950
Because I can.

570
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:59,110
Because I want you to putthat
genie back in the bottle.

571
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:05,540
Because idon't want you going through high schoolwith
everyone remembering you for things that, frankly, 

572
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:11,300
if I was given a choice, I'm
not sureI would wish on you.

573
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,180
There is so much moreto you than that.

574
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,550
I can't bear the thoughtof
you taking a math test, 

575
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:22,740
and everyone thinking thatyou
had an unfair advantage.

576
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,020
Or some boy wanting toask you out, 

577
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:30,710
but hesitating because he's
surethat you already know.

578
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,680
And for people clamoringfor your
attention for all the wrong reasons.

579
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,450
Not because theywant to know you, 

580
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,750
but because they want to
knowwhat they think you know.

581
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,880
Can I tell you a secret?

582
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,510
It wasn't even my idea.

583
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,190
She came up to me at schooland
started asking about you.

584
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,170
Said she'd pay anythingto
know her future.

585
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,010
What college she'dend up going to.

586
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:05,380
What the name of the manshe
was going to marry would be.

587
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,420
And I wantedthat makeup case so bad.

588
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,440
I just started writingdown
anything that...

589
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:16,600
came to my mind, and
then I told it to her.

590
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:22,360
I have no ideaif I'm
right about any of it.

591
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,810
Neither will she. Not for years.

592
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,710
Oh, my girl.

593
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,470
Trust me. Trust me.

594
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,350
You have to givethat money back.

595
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,510
It might hurt alittle bit at
first, but then, after that...

596
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,790
mommy, what's this?

597
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,740
Oh, I completely forgot about this.

598
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,520
Oh, I think it's supposedto
be some kind of fairy.

599
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,390
But I don't know what
itmeans or why I drew it.

600
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,680
Is it a magic fairy?

601
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,810
You know, I don't knowwhat
kind of fairy she is.

602
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:12,870
Oh, wait, wait. Oh, she's
a sleepy-time fairy.

603
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,680
And she's saying
thatall the little girls

604
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:21,500
who sneak around and go through their
mama'sthings have to go to bed now.

605
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,820
I heard voices, fighting.

606
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,360
Sweetie, whatare you doing
awake? You should be asleep.

607
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:37,900
This is stacey's room.
She doesn't likeus in here.

608
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,280
Don't worry, sweetie.

609
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,270
Stacey's gone.

610
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,940
- Gone?
- Yes.

611
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,190
Gone forever.

612
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,810
Can you keep a secret?

613
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:57,190
Stacey wanted to send you away.

614
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,350
To a hospital.

615
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,100
She wanted us both to leave.

616
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:05,270
She wanted daddy all to herself.

617
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,050
Don't want to go to hospital.

618
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,550
Oh, sweetie, I know that.

619
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,240
I know that, and you knowI
could never let that happen.

620
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:16,350
I wouldn't let hersend you away, so
I made her leave to protect you.

621
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,930
But then I startedto get scared.

622
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,800
I got scaredthat daddy might be upset.

623
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:25,490
What if daddy got mad at
mebecause stacey had left?

624
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,740
Daddy loves stacey.

625
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,140
Daddy loves stacey.

626
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,540
And daddy loves chloe.

627
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:38,360
In fact, he never getsmad at
chloe, so I told him you did it.

628
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,430
- Me?
- YeS.

629
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,700
Just like that other timewith the bad
nurse who kept telling on you and me?

630
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,750
Remember we told daddythat you hit her?

631
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,100
This is justlike that.

632
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:54,560
And now everything's goingto be fine.

633
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,950
You can keep my secret
for me, can't you, baby?

634
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,610
And you'll never telldaddy the truth?

635
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,450
Even if he asks?

636
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,450
No, I won'T.

637
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,370
He'll be so mad at me.

638
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,000
I won't tell, I won't!

639
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:18,830
Oh, I love you so much.

640
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,120
I used the fairy.

641
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,230
Do you want to touch it?

642
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,270
Feel what itfelt like?

643
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,080
Go on.

644
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,980
Put yourhands on it.

645
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,350
You're not goingto hurt anything.

646
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,710
Wait.

647
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,420
I have to call larry watt.

648
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,660
Oh, it's going rightto voicemail.

649
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,650
Oh, it's-it's barely 7:00.

650
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,160
His cell phoneprobably
isn't even on yet.

651
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,330
he's still not picking up.

652
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,180
Hey, mom, can we havesloppy
joes for breakfast some time?

653
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,370
Sure, babe.

654
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,600
Joe: Allison, putthe phone down.

655
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:13,330
The man obviouslyisn't at work yet.

656
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,940
No. I'll feed the kids.

657
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,620
You go get ready for court.

658
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,280
Woman : This was the scene just before
dawn at the mariposa county courthouse, 

659
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:25,280
where accused killer john edgemont confessed
and surrendered to the district attorney

660
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,680
in the bludgeoning
death of his wife, stacey.

661
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,540
- Edgemont pled guilty to second degree ...
- Oh, my god.

662
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,180
- Tell mommyyou want sloppy joes.
- ...manslaughter with conspiracy after the fact.

663
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,300
Kids, shh!

664
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,180
Edgemont, in a sudden, early
morning confession, 

665
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:39,510
admitted that he struck his wife with
a small sculpture during an argument, 

666
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,400
then attempted to mislead authorities by
staging a car accident to cover up the crime.

667
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,400
Even as we speak, the judge in the case is meeting with
the attorneys from both sides to determine sentencing...

668
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,370
this is terrible. He thinks it's chloe.

669
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,490
He thinks he's protectingsomeone
who needs protecting.

670
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,340
I have to get down there.

671
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:57,830
Watt: The other thing toremember
here is, it's not overtill it's over...

672
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,110
I'll tell you, mrs. Dubois.

673
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:10,190
This arriving after everything has happened isnot
a good thing for your reputationas a psychic.

674
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,190
I woke up.

675
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,590
I saw it... on the television.

676
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,070
Why?

677
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,640
I got a call at3:00 in the morning.

678
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,690
He wanted to confess, wanted
to turn himself in.

679
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,080
There was nochanging his mind.

680
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,790
There was no talkingto him about it.

681
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:28,700
No one's more shockedby
all this than I am.

682
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:35,080
Well, I'm going to head
home andgrab a shower.

683
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,660
If you needanything.

684
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,160
I'm fine.

685
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,820
Mrs. Dubois.

686
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:51,720
I know my father wouldwant me to thank
you for all that you didon his behalf.

687
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,360
I know he didn't do it.

688
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,500
Mr. Watt told me.

689
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:58,170
Oh, he loves my sister.

690
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,250
Maybe too much.

691
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,640
Why 3:00 in the morning?
Why the sudden urgency?

692
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,310
I don't know.

693
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,300
I mentioned to himabout your drawing.

694
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,170
The fairy?

695
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,810
I saw whenit came to you
in thatlawyer's office.

696
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:19,850
I think he was concerned that it was only a
matterof time before someone found the statue, 

697
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,040
tied my sister to the crime.

698
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,390
Your sister, right.

699
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:28,400
so what happens to
her nowafter all this?

700
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:32,550
Doesn't she just end upin a
hospital or an institution anyway?

701
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,820
Absolutely not.

702
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:37,840
She'll be with mein the house we
grew up in, just like daddy wants.

703
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:41,970
Until you get mad at her, or you
don't need herfor an alibi anymore.

704
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,840
Or you just get tiredof
watching over her.

705
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:53,040
Once again, my whole family appreciates
all that you've done for us.

706
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,990
Have a nice day, mrs. Dubois.

707
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,140
I'll be watching you.

708
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,580
I'm watching you

709
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,700
