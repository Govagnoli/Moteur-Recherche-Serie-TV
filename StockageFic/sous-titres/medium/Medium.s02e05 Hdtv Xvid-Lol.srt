1
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:06,956
Okay... so who wants to be the medium?

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,600
Oh, come on, guys, someone has to call the dead out to play.

3
00:00:13,149 --> 00:00:14,058
Suzannah?

4
00:00:15,273 --> 00:00:16,666
Knew it, chicken.

5
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:19,312
Katie?

6
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:21,632
I don't know.

7
00:00:21,797 --> 00:00:23,165
I mean, it's your house.

8
00:00:23,216 --> 00:00:25,074
It's your idea.
It's your everything.

9
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,843
Hey, I'm trying to be polite.

10
00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:28,140
Allison?

11
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:33,676
Hey, I thought we were goingto go to the Safari Hotel, crash the pool.

12
00:00:33,727 --> 00:00:35,093
No, uh-uh, not tonight.

13
00:00:35,738 --> 00:00:40,125
I made an important decision. I need
the dead to tell me if I'm doing the right thing.

14
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:42,165
Fingertips on, everybody.

15
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:57,825
Spirits from beyond, we welcome you.

16
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:04,768
They're here.

17
00:01:04,883 --> 00:01:05,757
You're moving it.

18
00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:06,691
Bite me.

19
00:01:08,745 --> 00:01:10,669
Tell me, kind spirits,

20
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:16,080
is tomorrow the perfect day for me to pack up my car and head for California?

21
00:01:16,332 --> 00:01:17,595
- California?
- Are you insane?

22
00:01:17,646 --> 00:01:19,113
- You can't do that.
- What about your mom?

23
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:22,568
You're not really going to leave in the middle of senior year.

24
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,423
I got this two days ago.

25
00:01:27,612 --> 00:01:28,454
Playboy?

26
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,962
What? I'm 18.

27
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:32,952
Back at Easter, I borrowed Danny Brown's Polaroid,

28
00:01:33,003 --> 00:01:37,196
and I stood in front of the mirror, and I took naked pictures of myself,

29
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:38,474
and I sent them in.

30
00:01:38,525 --> 00:01:39,292
Lyla!

31
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:40,843
And they want to meet me.

32
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:43,403
"While it is difficult to tell from these pictures

33
00:01:43,454 --> 00:01:45,838
"whether you are actually Playboy material...

34
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:47,675
"if you are ever

35
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:49,843
"in Southern California, please feel free to..."

36
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:51,084
That's three things.

37
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:53,322
It's the ad I answered from the modeling agency

38
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:55,800
about the car shows and conventions, this letter,

39
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:58,328
and there's that guy that I met from L.A. at Pilgrim's

40
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:01,048
who said they're always looking for game show contestants.

41
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:02,708
I just...
I think it's a sign.

42
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,703
I think it's where I have to go.

43
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:07,123
Don't do this.

44
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:09,010
Well, what else am I going to do?

45
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:10,188
I hate this place.

46
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,780
I'm not college material.

47
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:14,507
And besides, my mom's got this new boyfriend,

48
00:02:14,558 --> 00:02:17,190
And it's getting weird.
He keeps looking at me funny.

49
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:19,455
I wish you'd at least wait till graduation.

50
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,857
Why? What do I need a diploma for?

51
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:25,211
I just... I want my life to start.
I don't want to wait.

52
00:02:27,934 --> 00:02:29,816
Why does everybody look so sad?

53
00:02:29,988 --> 00:02:32,011
I'm excited.
I want to celebrate.

54
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:34,351
Fine. I'm excited.

55
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:36,635
Anything to get out of here.

56
00:02:36,764 --> 00:02:38,093
Hey, you have your fake I.D.?

57
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:39,242
We could go to Pilgrim's.

58
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,179
Yeah, my purse is in the kitchen.

59
00:02:51,929 --> 00:02:54,641
They mock the dead with that game, you know.

60
00:02:56,956 --> 00:02:58,484
Ally, let's go!

61
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:00,973
I know the answer...

62
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:05,413
the answer to her question, and it's not pretty.

63
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,034
Do you want to know the answer?

64
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,429
I want you to go away.

65
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,661
I want you to leave me alone.

66
00:03:28,613 --> 00:03:30,533
Something coming in off the desert.

67
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,456
Did I wake you?

68
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:36,370
No, I'm fine.
I'm just...

69
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,878
Just a dream.

70
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,193
Was it a bad one?

71
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:42,954
No.

72
00:03:43,713 --> 00:03:46,189
Not really a dream.
It was...

73
00:03:48,356 --> 00:03:51,030
Well, I dreamt it, but it was more of a memory,

74
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:53,903
something that happened a long time ago.

75
00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:56,907
Nothing important.

76
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:58,701
Just a memory.

77
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:01,639
A rerun. What a rook.

78
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:00,586
Something I said?

79
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:02,401
What time is it?

80
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:03,889
5:47.

81
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,026
A.M.

82
00:05:08,595 --> 00:05:12,025
You probably haven't noticed, but everyone else in the house...

83
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,940
in the world, is sleeping.

84
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:20,075
And, I mean, speaking only for myself, I think they're on to something.

85
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:25,804
I'm sorry, I suddenly realized that this has been on my to-do list for the last 18 years.

86
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:28,969
And it can't wait for another hour and a half?

87
00:05:36,914 --> 00:05:40,110
We drove backwards down the Arizona Pike one night.

88
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:41,779
Well, she drove.

89
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:44,704
I just sat in the front seat and screamed.

90
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:46,383
That is crazy.

91
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,570
We ran naked through the middle of the Boy Scout Jamboree in Prescott at Easter.

92
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:55,608
I always wanted to be a scout.

93
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:59,459
We did a lot of other things I'm not telling you about.

94
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:00,487
Huh.

95
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:03,857
Yeah, she was pretty out there.

96
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,370
So, wait a sec.

97
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,772
What happened to her?
Where is she now?

98
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:12,226
I don't know.

99
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:16,450
She just up and drove to California one day.

100
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:19,044
I tried to write her a couple of times.

101
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:23,411
But to be fair, my address changed.

102
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:25,926
I had a lot going on in my life then, too.

103
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:28,596
College...

104
00:06:32,952 --> 00:06:34,286
...and then you.

105
00:06:34,804 --> 00:06:35,560
Me?

106
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,338
My very own Boy Scout Jamboree.

107
00:06:56,022 --> 00:06:59,192
Allison, I'd like you to meet Councilman Stuart McCallister.

108
00:07:05,455 --> 00:07:07,661
The Councilman has come to me with a personal problem,

109
00:07:07,712 --> 00:07:11,066
and Detective Scanlon and I thought you might be able to help.

110
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:13,604
I'm, uh, trying to locate someone,

111
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:18,032
and I'm told that you're, uh, pretty good at that.

112
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:20,225
Well, I have my days.

113
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:22,391
So, who are you looking for?

114
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,653
My daughter.

115
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:25,837
He hasn't seen her for a week.

116
00:07:25,888 --> 00:07:28,465
She said she was going to a movie and never came home.

117
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:29,521
I'm so sorry.

118
00:07:30,255 --> 00:07:31,713
It's not the first time.

119
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:34,222
She's 19, and the truth is,

120
00:07:34,273 --> 00:07:37,839
according to the law, she's free to do what she wants.

121
00:07:38,193 --> 00:07:39,589
Um, it's just that...

122
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:44,045
well, let's just say she takes some pleasure in associating with...

123
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:47,519
I-I think they're rather unsavory people.

124
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:52,200
And she's been known to indulge in some fairly risky behavior.

125
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:53,315
And if she can...

126
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:56,742
embarrass her father, the public servant,
at the same time,

127
00:07:56,938 --> 00:07:57,843
well, all the more fun.

128
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:58,494
Right.

129
00:07:58,406 --> 00:08:00,073
I explained to the councilman that since,

130
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:02,599
as far as we know,
she's not breaking the law,

131
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,494
the best we can do is find her and give her a nudge towards home.

132
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:07,098
And that's all I'm looking for.

133
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:09,372
Now, I've given the detective, uh, a list of her friends--

134
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:11,108
at least the ones I'm aware of--

135
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:13,005
places I believe she frequents.

136
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:18,311
Obviously, uh, everyone's discretion would be appreciated.

137
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:20,534
We didn't tell him anything about you.

138
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:22,533
Just, uh, that you're handy at these sorts of things.

139
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:24,268
I'm happy to do what I can.

140
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:26,637
Did you get any kind of vibe off him?

141
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:29,078
He likes his movies dirty.

142
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:30,185
He's a politician.

143
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:32,888
Doesn't that come with a hidden agenda and a skeleton in the closet?

144
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:34,463
I don't know, I felt sorry for him.

145
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,131
The whole thing sounded sad.

146
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:39,255
people ask me why I don't have kids.

147
00:08:39,655 --> 00:08:41,076
Come on, you were a kid once.

148
00:08:41,127 --> 00:08:41,952
Not me.

149
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:43,746
Came out just like this.

150
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:47,131
A few less clothes, maybe, but basically just like this.

151
00:08:48,648 --> 00:08:50,134
I'll get to work on this list of friends.

152
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:53,361
If I find anyone or anything interesting, I'll give you a call.

153
00:08:53,412 --> 00:08:54,082
Who knows?

154
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,937
Maybe she'll just come home all by herself.

155
00:08:57,988 --> 00:08:58,918
Oh, wait, wait!

156
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:02,022
Actually, I need a favor.

157
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:05,956
I need you to find someone for me.

158
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:08,237
She's an old friend of mine from high school.

159
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:11,280
I haven't seen her in ages, but she's been on my mind lately.

160
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:12,528
I'm guessing she might be married,

161
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:15,274
so she might have a different last name, but that's the year she was born--

162
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:17,465
the same as me-- and that's the year she graduated.

163
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:21,012
We went to the same high school, but really, that's all I have.

164
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,343
I'm sorry, the number you have...

165
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:27,580
I'm sorry, the number you have dialed has been...

166
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:31,355
...have dialed has been disconnected, and there is no forwarding number.

167
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:34,722
Uh, try Camelot Lane.

168
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:41,112
You don't have a Camelot Lane?

169
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,325
Oh, that's right.

170
00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:44,086
There is no more Camelot Lane.

171
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:46,744
Hi, um, my name's Allison Dubois,

172
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,587
but back in high school, my name was Allison Rolen.

173
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:54,405
I know it's been a long time, but I just thought I'd call and say hi, um,

174
00:09:54,456 --> 00:09:57,969
and maybe see if you kept in touch with Lyla Gallagher.

175
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:02,737
Anyway, I'd love to hear back from you, catch up and all that.

176
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:07,259
My number's, uh, 602-555-0119.

177
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:12,676
Everyone unconscious and accounted for.

178
00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:15,330
- No luck at all?
- Nope.

179
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:18,899
Pretty pathetic, huh?

180
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,874
A psychic who can't find no one or nothing.

181
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:25,380
Can I help you find the bedroom?

182
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:41,856
Al, hey, you okay?

183
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:42,925
I don't know.

184
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:46,816
Do we have earthquakes in Phoenix?

185
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:52,816
Hey.

186
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:53,577
Hey.

187
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:56,393
I think I found a Lyla in Oregon that fits our profile.

188
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:58,464
I wanted to talk to you about that.

189
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:02,542
I found her.

190
00:11:02,673 --> 00:11:03,727
Oh, my God!

191
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:05,453
I don't have all the details.

192
00:11:05,504 --> 00:11:09,638
It's probably gonna be another day or two before I have the specifics, but...

193
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:14,217
apparently, your friend drowned, back in '89, somewhere in Northern California.

194
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:20,932
You okay?

195
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,050
How could I have been so wrong?

196
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:28,209
In my head, she's been alive this whole time.

197
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:33,079
I'm sorry.

198
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:36,473
You know what?

199
00:11:37,165 --> 00:11:38,979
I haven't seen her since 1987.

200
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,206
I'm not sure that I'm entitled to be all that upset.

201
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,258
Does that mean I'm allowed to bring up work?

202
00:11:46,713 --> 00:11:48,008
Oh, yeah, definitely.

203
00:11:54,136 --> 00:11:56,962
Well... there's still no word on Cynthia McCallister.

204
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,203
No activity on her credit cards, nothing on her ATM card.

205
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:01,799
Nobody's spotted her car.

206
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:04,480
Her friends say they have absolutely no idea where she might have gone

207
00:12:04,531 --> 00:12:06,080
or who she might have gone with.

208
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:07,101
I called the Councilman

209
00:12:07,152 --> 00:12:08,683
and asked him if it might be possible to come over to the house,

210
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:10,620
see her room, take a look around.

211
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,054
I'm on my way over now.

212
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:14,974
I was wondering if you want to come with.

213
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,747
"No" is a perfectly acceptable answer, by the way.

214
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:23,292
Actually, I'd like that.

215
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,496
Cynthia's room is right down this way.

216
00:12:36,681 --> 00:12:39,307
Guess you'd know best if any of her stuff was missing.

217
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,800
Everything is still there.

218
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,872
And her suitcases are right where she always keeps them.

219
00:12:44,402 --> 00:12:46,498
This room been cleaned since she left?

220
00:12:48,564 --> 00:12:51,132
Carpets vacuumed, sheets washed?

221
00:12:53,178 --> 00:12:54,284
I didn't know.

222
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:56,600
Okay.

223
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,818
We'll let you know if we need anything else.

224
00:13:04,376 --> 00:13:06,346
Can't blame her for being thorough.

225
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:08,370
I wish my house was this clean.

226
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,759
Detective Scanlon, Mrs. Dubois.

227
00:13:19,921 --> 00:13:21,797
When Mrs. McCallister died 11 years ago,

228
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:24,128
I promised her I'd take care of Cynthia.

229
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:28,847
Clearly, I've not done a very good job.

230
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:24,799
Would either of you like some coffee?

231
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,954
I can have my staff bring you coffee.

232
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:28,910
I think I know what's going on here.

233
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:30,146
What are you talking about?

234
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:32,220
I think she's involved in pornography--

235
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,890
acting, performing.

236
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:36,657
I think he knows about it.
It's tearing him up.

237
00:14:36,744 --> 00:14:39,227
That's why we're here.
That's why he came to us.

238
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,264
I don't get it.
Why not tell us?

239
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,290
How am I supposed to bring this girl home
when he's not even telling me where to look?

240
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,007
He's trying to protect her.
She's his daughter.

241
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:48,361
Think about his side.

242
00:14:48,412 --> 00:14:51,438
Would you want to tell a police detective something like that?

243
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:53,219
Dirty Little Darlings IV?

244
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:54,331
Pardon?

245
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,280
It's the title of the movie that she's in.

246
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:57,831
He was trying to find it.

247
00:14:58,093 --> 00:15:01,245
The other day when I saw into his head, I misunderstood.

248
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:04,953
I think he was trying to find this movie.

249
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,938
I think he's having trouble believing it.

250
00:15:10,547 --> 00:15:11,695
How you holding up?

251
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:14,784
You know what?
I'll take it from here.

252
00:15:15,074 --> 00:15:16,451
What are you talking about?

253
00:15:16,502 --> 00:15:18,350
I'm going to drop you off at your house.

254
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:22,065
You need to be by yourself, get upset, say good bye to your friend.

255
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:23,786
You are entitled to that.

256
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,244
I can't believe she's doing this.

257
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:33,722
This? How about going to California?

258
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:35,793
Should we tell somebody?

259
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:38,155
Who are we going to tell?
Her mother?

260
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:39,644
Her mother's not going to care.

261
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:40,985
We can't let her go.

262
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:45,339
Thank you.

263
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:54,578
Okay, so if anyone asks, my name's Linda.

264
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,663
I'm a junior at the U. of A.

265
00:15:57,099 --> 00:15:59,374
And you girls are my dorm mates.

266
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,097
Ally, what you looking at?
The boys are over there.

267
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:09,043
Sorry.

268
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,879
Lyla, I'm worried about you, worried about this plan.

269
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,923
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control.

270
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:26,290
You okay?

271
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:28,833
You look like you've seen a ghost.

272
00:16:31,236 --> 00:16:32,404
Tell me something.

273
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,114
What's it like to be drunk?

274
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:37,556
Uh, what do you mean?

275
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:39,415
What's it like?

276
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:42,411
It's like what it's like.

277
00:16:42,715 --> 00:16:43,695
You want a sip?

278
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:46,852
I don't know.

279
00:16:48,028 --> 00:16:49,316
A toast to me.

280
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:50,643
New beginnings.

281
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:07,050
You stay in there any longer, you're going to turn into a prune.

282
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:10,360
A beautiful, naked prune.

283
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:16,251
How could I not have known she was dead?

284
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,115
I don't know.
You told me her family life was a mess.

285
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,748
It wasn't like they were going to contact you.

286
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:23,726
You were in college.

287
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:26,561
You probably weren't reading the papers every day.

288
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:28,207
It was years ago.

289
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:29,540
I'm talking about me.

290
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:34,292
I see the dead. They send me messages.
I'm the one they all come to.

291
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:37,793
How could I not have known?

292
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,466
What's going on?

293
00:17:59,884 --> 00:18:02,148
They just found Cynthia McCallister's car.

294
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:09,600
More blood in that car than...

295
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,410
If it all turns out to belong to Cynthia McCallister,

296
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:18,190
we're going to need to upgrade her from missing teen to homicide victim.

297
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:21,385
I better put in a call to the Councilman, make him aware.

298
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,504
Where's the body?

299
00:18:22,945 --> 00:18:23,841
I don't know.

300
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:27,527
I was kind of hoping you could tell me.

301
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:04,478
I can barely see you.

302
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:08,266
I can't hear you.

303
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:12,462
Go find someone else!

304
00:19:13,658 --> 00:19:15,132
Leave me alone!

305
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:18,510
Shut up!
Go away! I can't hear you!

306
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,130
Well, aren't you the sight.

307
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:54,249
Katie and Suzannah just took off, so... I guess it's just you and me.

308
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:57,886
Hey, you okay?

309
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:00,420
I'm excellent.

310
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,402
I'm actually... excellent.

311
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:14,897
Got to tell you...

312
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:19,247
this is not where I expected to spend my last night in Phoenix.

313
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,353
Then don't go.

314
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:28,052
I got to go.

315
00:20:30,953 --> 00:20:34,243
I'm going to miss you so much.

316
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:38,174
Me, too.

317
00:21:04,158 --> 00:21:04,953
Anything?

318
00:21:06,651 --> 00:21:08,149
Not about this, no.

319
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,960
I could take you back to the house.

320
00:21:12,258 --> 00:21:15,720
Well, I'm sure I could be just as useless there as I am here.

321
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,213
Okay.

322
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:21,039
These things were in her car...

323
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:24,496
the place where she was murdered.

324
00:21:24,547 --> 00:21:27,797
She touched them. They surrounded her,
probably at the moment of her death.

325
00:21:27,848 --> 00:21:32,257
There should be... some kind of energy to these things--

326
00:21:32,523 --> 00:21:35,433
her energy.
They should tell me something about her...

327
00:21:36,552 --> 00:21:38,212
about her last moments, but...

328
00:21:38,628 --> 00:21:40,162
when I hold these things...

329
00:21:42,846 --> 00:21:45,991
Look. I don't mean to pour salt in the wound.

330
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,325
I watched, uh, Dirty Little Darlings IV last night.

331
00:21:52,975 --> 00:21:54,160
Twice actually.

332
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,379
I'm sorry, Allison.

333
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,473
Cynthia McCallister's nowhere in that movie.

334
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:01,552
Of course not.

335
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:07,122
Just hung up with Forensics.

336
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,432
Preliminary tests indicate that all the blood in the car is Cynthia's--

337
00:22:10,483 --> 00:22:12,019
over four liters of the stuff.

338
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,201
There's simply no way she would have survived without an immediate transfusion.

339
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:17,671
We've checked every hospital in the state-- nothing.

340
00:22:17,722 --> 00:22:18,798
So where does that leave us?

341
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:21,515
We need to find her body or a weapon, something.

342
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:23,492
Doesn't do us any good to find the man that killed her

343
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:25,423
if we can't prove it in a court of law.

344
00:22:25,474 --> 00:22:26,622
The Councilman's office just called.

345
00:22:26,673 --> 00:22:28,299
He's ready whenever you are.

346
00:22:28,688 --> 00:22:30,697
The Councilman agreed to take a polygraph.

347
00:22:30,748 --> 00:22:33,539
You asked the grieving father to take a lie detector test?

348
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,887
It's standard procedure.

349
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,730
He understands that the sooner we can rule out family members, boyfriends,

350
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:40,265
anyone else around Cynthia that might be considered a suspect,

351
00:22:40,316 --> 00:22:44,870
the sooner we can concentrate our efforts on finding the person that actually did this.

352
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,700
Have you ever stolen money?

353
00:22:49,531 --> 00:22:50,200
No.

354
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:53,572
Is your name Stuart McCallister?

355
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:55,371
Yes.

356
00:22:56,804 --> 00:23:00,108
Do you have any knowledge of the whereabouts of your daughter?

357
00:23:01,606 --> 00:23:02,454
No.

358
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,006
Is your daughter's name Cynthia Marie?

359
00:23:07,591 --> 00:23:08,306
Yes.

360
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:13,467
Did you have anything to do with her death?

361
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:22,314
Did you have anything to do with Cynthia's death?

362
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:26,837
No, I did not.

363
00:23:27,969 --> 00:23:29,017
Nothing whatsoever?

364
00:23:30,726 --> 00:23:32,282
Nothing whatsoever.

365
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,365
Daddy, don't.

366
00:24:13,805 --> 00:24:14,861
Is today Thursday?

367
00:24:15,943 --> 00:24:16,985
Yes, it is.

368
00:24:18,496 --> 00:24:20,741
Is your name Stuart McCallister?

369
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:22,394
Yes, it is.

370
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:46,450
Stuart?

371
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:51,054
Manuel.

372
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,107
It's 9:30 at night, Manuel, we're meeting in the dark.

373
00:24:57,158 --> 00:24:59,698
I'm assuming you've found my daughter's body.

374
00:24:59,837 --> 00:25:02,209
What's left of it.
Do me the courtesy of

375
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,485
telling me quickly.
I'm not keen on theatrics.

376
00:25:05,668 --> 00:25:09,164
We've not found your daughter, that's not why I asked you here.

377
00:25:09,456 --> 00:25:10,208
Sit.

378
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,814
I'm fine.

379
00:25:14,357 --> 00:25:16,839
What are we doing here, Mr. District Attorney?

380
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:20,137
I've known you a long time, Stuart.

381
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:23,705
You're speaking of me as if I were the one who died.

382
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,190
One of my investigators has shared with me a certain...

383
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:29,900
theory of evidence.

384
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:35,224
Before I commit further resources,
brief other investigators, ask...

385
00:25:35,572 --> 00:25:39,667
others to follow this lead and thereby
make it a matter of public record,

386
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:44,106
I wanted to give you the opportunity to speak to its... veracity.

387
00:25:44,904 --> 00:25:45,834
Off the record.

388
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:48,751
I don't know what you're talking about.

389
00:25:51,804 --> 00:25:52,961
I need to know,

390
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:56,890
is there anything about the nature of your relationship with your daughter

391
00:25:56,941 --> 00:25:59,398
that might be seen as unique or special?

392
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:22,071
They called you?

393
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,946
They contacted you?

394
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:30,580
I'm sorry?

395
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,689
She'd been gone two days when I got the first call.

396
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:36,001
They sent me to one of those...

397
00:26:37,377 --> 00:26:38,774
adult movie stores.

398
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:40,152
Video stores.

399
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,705
Told me to buy this used DVD...

400
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:45,389
and watch it.

401
00:26:47,236 --> 00:26:48,905
They wanted $100,000.

402
00:27:02,465 --> 00:27:03,839
And I sent it to them.

403
00:27:07,608 --> 00:27:09,352
And they slaughtered her anyway.

404
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,357
I'm sorry...

405
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,247
I'm lost.

406
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,103
Are you telling me your daughter was kidnapped?

407
00:27:15,154 --> 00:27:17,556
I'm telling you the same thing I told you the first time I came in here--

408
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:20,457
that my daughter consorted with unsavory people.

409
00:27:21,232 --> 00:27:23,576
And I believe these people are the ones who killed her...

410
00:27:23,627 --> 00:27:27,719
the ones who tricked her into taping us,
the ones who were blackmailing me.

411
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:33,125
So you're telling me that there's some sort of recording out there?

412
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,806
And that it... documents...

413
00:27:37,247 --> 00:27:39,201
your relationship with your daughter?

414
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:43,992
I thought we were going to be direct
and honest with each other, Manuel.

415
00:27:44,043 --> 00:27:45,551
Don't get coy on me now.

416
00:27:52,618 --> 00:27:53,649
You're shocked.

417
00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:56,899
My feelings are beside the point, Stuart.

418
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,128
I'm a civilized person, Manuel.

419
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:03,187
I know what you're thinking.

420
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:05,011
But I am not...

421
00:28:06,092 --> 00:28:09,239
- the author of this situation.
- You were the parent.

422
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:14,584
When Cynthia's mother died...

423
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:17,908
I realized...

424
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:23,818
giving comfort to an 11-year-old girl...

425
00:28:25,138 --> 00:28:25,875
it's...

426
00:28:28,811 --> 00:28:29,996
it's not really...

427
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:33,811
something I knew how to do.

428
00:28:37,595 --> 00:28:38,336
But...

429
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,072
she was in such distress.

430
00:28:44,134 --> 00:28:46,054
Did you kill your daughter, Stuart?

431
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,260
Of course not.

432
00:28:55,305 --> 00:28:56,651
I loved my daughter.

433
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:16,010
Councilman McCallister, where are you going?

434
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,051
Home.

435
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:21,305
To grieve.

436
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:24,471
Sir, I don't think I can let you leave.

437
00:29:28,832 --> 00:29:30,726
I don't think you have a choice.

438
00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:35,636
This is America--
you can't charge a man with hearsay.

439
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,115
Good night, Mr. District Attorney.

440
00:30:04,947 --> 00:30:05,979
It's your boss.

441
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:08,737
He was just here.
We just spoke.

442
00:30:09,403 --> 00:30:11,189
Everything you suspected is true.

443
00:30:14,353 --> 00:30:15,933
So what happens now?

444
00:30:16,204 --> 00:30:17,344
Nothing happens now.

445
00:30:17,455 --> 00:30:19,601
I can't offer your vision as evidence.

446
00:30:20,534 --> 00:30:23,418
And unless and until that DVD surfaces...

447
00:30:26,478 --> 00:30:27,339
I got to go.

448
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,504
I understand.

449
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,015
And the punch line is:

450
00:30:35,424 --> 00:30:36,844
life sucks.

451
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:44,146
And the joke is?

452
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:47,731
It's what you said?

453
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:50,971
His own daughter.

454
00:30:55,285 --> 00:30:56,345
I'm sorry.

455
00:30:56,782 --> 00:30:58,852
And he's going to get away with it.

456
00:31:02,265 --> 00:31:03,390
Why?

457
00:31:05,192 --> 00:31:07,665
Why fill my head with all this ugliness

458
00:31:08,392 --> 00:31:11,368
when it doesn't matter,
when it doesn't do any good?

459
00:31:13,943 --> 00:31:16,031
Why wouldn't Lyla visit me?

460
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:20,176
Why wouldn't she tell me herself that she's gone?

461
00:31:23,877 --> 00:31:25,113
I don't know, baby.

462
00:31:37,673 --> 00:31:38,354
Joe?

463
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,551
Joe?

464
00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:41,390
Joe? Joe?

465
00:31:42,415 --> 00:31:43,024
Joe!

466
00:31:43,617 --> 00:31:45,439
What?! What?!
What is it?

467
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:48,319
We just had an earthquake.
Didn't you feel that?

468
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:49,729
No.

469
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,059
All I feel is you shaking me awake.

470
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:54,449
I don't hear the girls.

471
00:31:55,111 --> 00:31:56,677
I don't hear any sirens.

472
00:31:57,318 --> 00:31:59,354
- I'm telling you, we had an earthquake.
- Power's on.

473
00:31:59,405 --> 00:32:01,700
I've been dreaming about it for days and we finally had one.

474
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:04,882
I had a glass of water on the bedside table beside me and it's filled to the top.

475
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:06,257
Not a drop is missing.

476
00:32:06,783 --> 00:32:09,301
Fine, don't believe me.
I'm putting on the news.

477
00:32:09,352 --> 00:32:10,479
Excuse me?

478
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:12,576
You'll see.
It'll be on the news.

479
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:17,508
And in the small Arizona border town of San Miguel,

480
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:22,488
residents are applauding the selfless actions of local teacher, Geraldine Hanscom.

481
00:32:22,795 --> 00:32:23,632
Earlier this week,

482
00:32:23,683 --> 00:32:28,418
the very shy Ms. Hanscom not only risked her life to save a young girl from drowning,

483
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,596
They're going to put one of those little banners across the bottom.

484
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:33,783
but actually turned down a generous cash reward offered to her by the girl's parents.

485
00:32:33,834 --> 00:32:34,434
Instead,

486
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:38,815
Ms. Hanscom asked that the money be donated to the local San Miguel High School

487
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:42,057
where she teaches English to teenage migrant workers.

488
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:43,403
Three days ago,

489
00:32:43,454 --> 00:32:46,933
Ms. Hanscom nearly lost her own life while rescuing a young girl

490
00:32:46,984 --> 00:32:49,444
who had fallen into a flash-flooded river.

491
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:52,337
Floods don't count, we're looking for earthquakes.

492
00:32:53,315 --> 00:32:54,039
Ow.

493
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:56,479
It's her.

494
00:32:57,597 --> 00:32:58,799
Joe, it's Lyla.

495
00:32:59,503 --> 00:33:01,305
That's her.
She's still alive.

496
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:02,728
Lyla Gallagher?

497
00:33:03,884 --> 00:33:05,173
How's that possible?

498
00:33:05,491 --> 00:33:06,433
I don't know.

499
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:10,668
But when I get a chance, I'm going to go ask her.

500
00:33:15,738 --> 00:33:18,354
You're trespassing, and I will call the sheriff.

501
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:19,967
How do I get you people to understand

502
00:33:20,018 --> 00:33:22,704
I have no interest in being in the paper or on television.

503
00:33:22,755 --> 00:33:25,008
Lyla, it's me.

504
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:27,040
It's Allison.
It's Allison Rolen.

505
00:33:30,867 --> 00:33:32,443
Oh, my God. Allison.

506
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,111
Oh, crap.

507
00:33:45,198 --> 00:33:46,430
They're so beautiful.

508
00:33:47,949 --> 00:33:49,051
What about you?

509
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:54,711
I have 23 of them, and they'll be here in about ten minutes.

510
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:57,182
I saw you on television.

511
00:33:57,233 --> 00:34:00,864
Well, I saw Geraldine Hanscom on television.

512
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,323
I was looking for you.

513
00:34:05,945 --> 00:34:06,669
Okay.

514
00:34:11,076 --> 00:34:12,526
It's flattering, I guess.

515
00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:19,431
But I need you to leave me alone.

516
00:34:20,488 --> 00:34:21,297
What?

517
00:34:22,517 --> 00:34:23,491
Why?

518
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:26,832
Lyla... the whole world thinks you're dead.

519
00:34:27,008 --> 00:34:31,817
I know, and it took a lot of time, luck and money to make it happen.

520
00:34:34,857 --> 00:34:36,735
So, please, Allison, just go home.

521
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,394
Not without a why.

522
00:34:39,717 --> 00:34:41,504
Not without an answer.

523
00:34:42,224 --> 00:34:44,187
I drove all night to get here.

524
00:34:44,325 --> 00:34:46,169
I'm not going home empty-handed.

525
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,079
You ever made a mistake?

526
00:34:52,928 --> 00:34:56,508
When I left Phoenix and came to California, I made a lot of them.

527
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,378
I even married one of them.

528
00:34:59,953 --> 00:35:03,701
Did a lot of really stupid things with a lot of really stupid people.

529
00:35:04,316 --> 00:35:05,575
Did a lot for money.

530
00:35:07,282 --> 00:35:09,269
Took a lot of really stupid drugs.

531
00:35:10,384 --> 00:35:12,396
Made a lot of really stupid choices.

532
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,936
It just got really dark.

533
00:35:17,163 --> 00:35:18,965
The truth is I wanted to die...

534
00:35:20,676 --> 00:35:25,542
and I realize now I did everything short of actually killing myself to make it happen.

535
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:29,343
My husband Billy and I were up north.

536
00:35:30,236 --> 00:35:31,980
We were driving through Oakland.

537
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:34,419
We got into this enormous fight--
something about drugs.

538
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,335
I took his, he took mine.

539
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:41,221
We needed money, and I was in no shape to do what was necessary to get it.

540
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:44,024
Anyway, he throws me out of his car.

541
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,387
I mean, I'm in the middle of Oakland with nothing.

542
00:35:50,622 --> 00:35:53,057
It's October 17, 1989.

543
00:35:54,724 --> 00:35:56,904
20 minutes later, the whole place shook.

544
00:35:57,649 --> 00:35:59,200
It was a 7.1 earthquake.

545
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:00,757
I remember it.

546
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:02,672
I read about it.

547
00:36:02,939 --> 00:36:04,549
Me, too, the next day.

548
00:36:06,189 --> 00:36:07,513
I was in this shelter.

549
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:10,157
I saw this paper.

550
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:12,116
There's a list of the dead.

551
00:36:13,043 --> 00:36:14,761
Me and my husband were on it.

552
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:19,227
My wallet, my bag, everything I owned was in Billy's car.

553
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:22,957
Billy's car went off the Oakland Bay Bridge during the quake.

554
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:24,208
Oh, my God.

555
00:36:24,623 --> 00:36:26,249
At first, I was frantic.

556
00:36:27,116 --> 00:36:28,694
Everyone thinks I'm dead.

557
00:36:29,275 --> 00:36:30,439
This is horrible.

558
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:35,014
But then I realized...

559
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:37,567
no.

560
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:41,017
This is the chance of a lifetime.

561
00:36:42,432 --> 00:36:44,662
This is the chance of a second lifetime.

562
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:47,095
I don't get it.
How did you do it?

563
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,274
A new name?
A new social security number?

564
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:55,033
There's this guy.

565
00:36:55,273 --> 00:36:56,379
His name's Sammy.

566
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,468
He works out of a room in Nogales.

567
00:36:59,221 --> 00:37:01,107
He can get you anything you need.

568
00:37:01,162 --> 00:37:02,557
The ultimate do-over.

569
00:37:04,254 --> 00:37:06,781
The only thing is it costs $100,000.

570
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:10,716
Took me five years to work it off.

571
00:37:12,551 --> 00:37:16,018
I answered phones.

572
00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:18,002
I made deliveries.

573
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:20,447
Got my teaching certificate at night.

574
00:37:23,705 --> 00:37:25,373
But I would've done anything.

575
00:37:26,752 --> 00:37:28,935
I was so happy being Gerry Hanscom.

576
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,918
It was like being born again...

577
00:37:33,093 --> 00:37:35,201
like being present for my own birth.

578
00:37:36,231 --> 00:37:38,847
I don't understand.
So this guy gives people...

579
00:37:39,293 --> 00:37:40,250
new lives?

580
00:37:42,201 --> 00:37:44,741
But what if you're not in a natural disaster?

581
00:37:46,243 --> 00:37:48,134
How do you get the death certificate?

582
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:51,799
For another $100,000, Sammy could tell you how to handle that, too.

583
00:37:51,857 --> 00:37:56,432
All you need is a year, a box of hypodermic needles and a portable freezer.

584
00:37:56,969 --> 00:37:58,033
What do you mean?

585
00:37:58,996 --> 00:38:01,578
He'd teach you how to collect your own blood--

586
00:38:01,757 --> 00:38:04,171
a pint or so every week or two.
Store it.

587
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,330
Keep it cold.

588
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:10,489
When you figured out where you want to die, dump the blood and make a real mess.

589
00:38:11,434 --> 00:38:13,685
There isn't a coroner anywhere

590
00:38:14,222 --> 00:38:18,364
who won't declare you legally dead if he sees at least four liters of blood.

591
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,301
Four liters, huh?

592
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,915
Four liters is the magic number.

593
00:38:25,317 --> 00:38:26,943
And you worked for this guy?

594
00:38:27,144 --> 00:38:27,756
Yeah.

595
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:29,912
Why?

596
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:33,899
Because I need you to do me a favor.

597
00:38:39,226 --> 00:38:39,952
Cynthia?

598
00:38:42,406 --> 00:38:43,164
Maybe.

599
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,658
You work for Sammy?

600
00:38:49,506 --> 00:38:50,696
Are those my papers?

601
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:52,446
My name is Allison Dubois.

602
00:38:54,587 --> 00:38:59,015
I work for the Phoenix District Attorney's Office, and, yeah, these are your papers.

603
00:38:59,295 --> 00:38:59,933
Unfortunately,

604
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:03,916
I'm going to need to hang onto these as evidence in a trial against you

605
00:39:04,173 --> 00:39:06,293
on charges of blackmail and fraud.

606
00:39:13,129 --> 00:39:14,671
Did you do it by yourself?

607
00:39:17,006 --> 00:39:18,279
Pretty much.

608
00:39:20,085 --> 00:39:20,823
I, uh...

609
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:25,769
I paid a vagrant ten dollars to put the disc in the case at the video store,

610
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:30,247
and I hired another guy for 20 to make the phone call to my dad.

611
00:39:34,177 --> 00:39:37,757
If you're working for my father, you're in league with the devil.

612
00:39:39,218 --> 00:39:40,970
So long as you understand that.

613
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,741
I have a pretty good idea...

614
00:39:44,602 --> 00:39:45,976
of what he did to you.

615
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,796
You don't know the half of it.

616
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:57,701
Pretty screwed-up world.

617
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:00,416
After everything that he did,

618
00:40:01,908 --> 00:40:04,435
I'll rot in a jail cell, and he'll be walking free.

619
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:07,438
Not necessarily.
He said that there was some recording.

620
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,556
- If we could get our hands on that...
- I was 19 on that DVD.

621
00:40:13,784 --> 00:40:16,140
He'll argue that there was implied consent.

622
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:27,492
Unfortunately, I wasn't smart enough to tape us when I was 11...

623
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,445
or 12 or...

624
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:45,094
Hang onto these papers, Elizabeth.
You're going to need them.

625
00:40:48,135 --> 00:40:50,365
I'm sorry I bothered you.

626
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:52,898
I thought you were someone else, another girl.

627
00:40:54,216 --> 00:40:58,522
I heard she was dead, but when I saw you, I thought maybe.

628
00:41:02,215 --> 00:41:03,747
I guess I was wrong.

629
00:41:05,722 --> 00:41:07,540
How far are we from the border here?

630
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:08,744
Half a mile?

631
00:41:10,123 --> 00:41:13,669
With the right papers, a person could safely get across the border in 15 minutes,

632
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,042
so even if a person did mistakenly spot you and happen to call the authorities,

633
00:41:18,168 --> 00:41:20,865
you could be safely gone before they arrived.

634
00:41:21,808 --> 00:41:22,542
Go.

635
00:41:23,003 --> 00:41:24,179
I got the check.

636
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,120
You make sure that the right people see that.

637
00:41:37,943 --> 00:41:39,033
The girl on it...

638
00:41:40,837 --> 00:41:41,806
she's dead...

639
00:41:42,371 --> 00:41:43,259
but the man...

640
00:41:47,098 --> 00:41:47,968
Don't worry.

641
00:41:49,117 --> 00:41:50,793
I know what to do with this.

642
00:42:00,581 --> 00:42:01,303
Coffee?

643
00:42:01,354 --> 00:42:03,721
No, I'm fine.
Just-just the check.

644
00:42:04,351 --> 00:42:06,913
Hopefully everything met your expectations.

645
00:42:09,557 --> 00:42:10,345
Oh, yeah.

646
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:15,130
Everything was perfect.

647
00:42:34,363 --> 00:42:37,331
