1
00:00:01,158 --> 00:00:03,484
Do you know what she looks like?

2
00:00:03,484 --> 00:00:05,231
Of course, I know what she looks like.

3
00:00:05,231 --> 00:00:10,204
I wouldn't be much of a psychic if I didn't know
what the girl of your dreams looks like.

4
00:00:11,739 --> 00:00:17,808
She is blonde, athletic,
and very flexible.

5
00:00:17,808 --> 00:00:20,418
Really?
I don't usually attract to the athletic type.

6
00:00:20,418 --> 00:00:24,614
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
I am just a conduit

7
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:26,342
This is the universe talking.

8
00:00:26,342 --> 00:00:30,609
And the universe has just told me
that you are going to meet a girl.

9
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:33,760
Oh, tough luck there, sport
your ten minutes are up,

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,384
why don't you go see if you can borrow
your mom's credit card and
give me a call back, ok?

11
00:00:39,384 --> 00:00:41,215
Sure thing, Michael.

12
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:06,381
- I'm on my break.
-  What are you talking about, a break?

13
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:08,504
You are not working at the mall there,
there is no break.

14
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:11,458
I'm on my break, man.

15
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,333
Listen, there are laws, ok?

16
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,440
Well, just one of your regulars.

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,742
If you want me put it through
to someone else, I will.

18
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:20,138
Hit me, baby. One more time.

19
00:01:21,557 --> 00:01:24,354
Hello, and thank you for calling 'Psy-Line'

20
00:01:24,354 --> 00:01:30,441
Your personal phone psychic is on and
ready to open up the portals to the psychic universe

21
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:32,165
Michael?
Is that you?

22
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:34,236
Oh, thank God, it's Tanya King.

23
00:01:34,236 --> 00:01:37,359
Ms. King. How was Paris?

24
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,833
Oh, Michael. Michael, Michael, Michael.

25
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:46,172
Ms. King, you can call me crazy,
but I am sensing some bad energy here,

26
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:50,013
- Has something happened?
- It's.. It's Gregory.

27
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:51,710
I've lost him.

28
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,187
You are kidding.
Though he's kind of big for that.

29
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:56,291
He is dead, Michael.

30
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:59,471
He has been murdered.

31
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:03,527
- Oh, Michael.
- Well, that's not good.

32
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:15,827
Hello.

33
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:19,001
Hey, it's Lee,
sorry to wake you but I've got a problem.

34
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:21,813
- Maybe you walk me through.
- No, i'll try. What's going on?

35
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:23,922
I am here at the crime scene
of robbery gone bad.

36
00:02:23,922 --> 00:02:27,871
Man of the house surprised the intruder,
got his head bashing for his trouble,

37
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:31,722
Wife comes home from trip to Paris,
now finds him dead in the living room.

38
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:34,918
Wait, did you say Paris?

39
00:02:34,918 --> 00:02:37,442
Yeah, but that is not important,
here is where I need your help.

40
00:02:37,442 --> 00:02:41,733
She locked herself in the bed room,
apparently she's talking on the phone
with her own personal psychic

41
00:02:42,556 --> 00:02:45,280
- What do you think?
- I think I'm..

42
00:02:45,926 --> 00:02:47,179
On my way over.

49
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:37,971
By the looks of it,
the intruder encountered Mr. King somewhere in this room,

50
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:42,366
They fought and worked
away towards the fire place.

51
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:46,045
Intruder grabbed that poker
and struck Mr. King repeatedly.

52
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:50,170
Somewhere and all that, he hit his head on
that marble edge, broke his neck.

53
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,410
Grabbed Mr. King's wallet, his five-carat ring,
and a gold watch with diamond face.

54
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,351
- Worth about forty grands.
- Oh.

55
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:59,710
Detective Scanlon.
My mother is finally off the phone.

56
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,967
Thank God,
I've convinced her to talk to you.

57
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:05,323
- Okay, come on.
- Come on, Bridgette, go.

58
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:07,663
Come on everyone, pile in.

59
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,581
Oh, man!

60
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:20,898
So they broke into the car?

61
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:26,362
- It doesn't look like anything is missing.
- But, I don't get it,

62
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:29,288
someone just broke your window
for no reason at all? Why would they do that?

63
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:32,150
I don't know, honey,
sometimes people do strange things.

64
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,377
Can you pass me that blanket?

65
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:39,114
- So sorry, daddy.
- It's not your fault.

66
00:04:39,114 --> 00:04:42,551
If I hadn't taken up all that room
in the garage to do my art project,

67
00:04:43,306 --> 00:04:45,436
It's ok.

68
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:51,489
But, I don't understand,
why would anyone ever be so mean?

69
00:04:52,446 --> 00:04:55,394
My husband was a wonderful man.

70
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:58,264
Loyal, devoted.

71
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,803
He was a center of my world.

72
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,000
I understand, on occasion,

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,960
that the police have
been known to employ

74
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,336
- the services of psychics.
- Mother.

75
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:15,422
Now we understand
what you might have seen on TV,

76
00:05:15,422 --> 00:05:18,090
that is not really a policy to
the Pheonix's police department, Mrs. King.

77
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,376
Be that as it may

78
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:24,521
I have been in touch
with a very gifted and
sensitive young man from Los Angeles.

79
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:26,014
As soon as you finish
your work here,

80
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:30,396
I intend to ask him to come here
to aver his assistance.

81
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:34,473
- Mom. Please don't do this.
- Wesley. Please

82
00:05:34,473 --> 00:05:37,785
Mrs. King. Speaking as a representative of
the district attorney's office,

83
00:05:37,785 --> 00:05:40,295
you don't wanna do that.

84
00:05:40,295 --> 00:05:44,512
We wanna find whoever did this.
We wanna put them away for life.

85
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:46,460
You walk into a court of law,

86
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,953
and you say that
psychic was involved with
the preparation of your case,

87
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:53,702
and frankly,
jurors will just start rolling their eyes.

88
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:58,295
I've spent months getting to know
this young man on the telephone.

89
00:05:58,295 --> 00:06:04,989
He is a thoughtful, sensitive,
sober gentleman with a rare and valuable gift.

90
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:10,491
I am certain that in person,
a jury will find him just as compelling as I do.

91
00:06:18,548 --> 00:06:19,802
Thank you for calling Psy-Line.

92
00:06:19,802 --> 00:06:26,129
Your personal phone psychic is on and
ready to open up the portals of the psychic universe.

93
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:28,856
- Michael.
- Hey, wait a minute.

94
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:32,054
I'm the psychic around here,
who am I talking to?

95
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:34,717
It's your sister.
It's Allison.

96
00:06:34,717 --> 00:06:37,524
Hey, sis
How cool is this?

97
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:42,005
Who would have thought out of all the phone psychics
in the world, you had to get me.

98
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:43,810
I asked for you, Michael.

99
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,389
Hey, did you know that
your cell phone is disconnected?

100
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:51,041
Yep. No. They do that now,
after a year if I don't pay the bill.

101
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,477
Don't get mad at me

102
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:55,573
I blew up my knee, and
I couldn't work construction anymore.

103
00:06:55,573 --> 00:06:59,353
Listen, I have to ask you something.
Do you have a client named Tanya King?

104
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:02,751
Yeah. Sure.
Talk to her every Tuesday.

105
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:05,550
Pretty sad though.
I guess she was away..

106
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,599
Her husband got beaten to death, yeah, I know.

107
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:10,253
They have you on her husband's case?

108
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:13,484
- Well, you must be a mind reader.
- Haha

109
00:07:13,484 --> 00:07:17,534
Here is the thing, I have a feeling that
she is gonna want to get you involved.

110
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:19,412
- Involved in what?
- In the case,

111
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:22,722
in the investigation on the search
for her husband's killer.

112
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:25,666
That's crazy, why would
I get involved there, I live in Los Angeles.

113
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:29,093
I am a telephone psychic and
I work in my underwear.

114
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:34,184
Well, I just left her. And apparently,
she thinks you are very gifted.

115
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:35,704
And very sensitive.

116
00:07:35,704 --> 00:07:38,958
Well, you've got nothing to worry about
because you and I both know

117
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:43,447
I am neither gifted nor sensitive,
just broke.

118
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:48,149
And just like the ad says,
"this service is for entertainment purposes only."

119
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:53,698
Daddy?

120
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:57,503
Bridgette, what are you doing up?
It's late, you are supposed to be asleep.

121
00:07:57,503 --> 00:08:00,481
I know who broke the window of your car.

122
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:01,575
What are you talking about?

123
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:04,467
Your window.
I saw who did it.

124
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:07,450
It was Mrs...
 Mrs. Ubershire.

125
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:12,102
- Mrs. Who?
- Mrs. Ubershire, my math teacher.

126
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,237
Bridgette, honey.
How could you have seen that?

127
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:20,490
It happened last night
when we were all asleep.

128
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,631
I saw tonight, when I went to bed.
I had a dream.

129
00:08:27,504 --> 00:08:30,027
Um.. It turns out Bridgette
has cracked the mystery of

130
00:08:30,027 --> 00:08:33,749
- who smashed my car window.
- You are kidding, who?

131
00:08:33,749 --> 00:08:37,858
- Apparently, it is her mean old math teacher
- Ha. Mrs. Ubershire?

132
00:08:37,858 --> 00:08:39,379
Yeah.

133
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:40,799
She is the culprit according to Bridgette.

134
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,216
She wants you to tell the people at work
have them arrest her.

135
00:08:44,216 --> 00:08:46,889
She is recommending a life sentence.

136
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:50,822
- That sounds fair.
- When I mentioned to her that..

137
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,595
that might interfere with her
completing math class this year

138
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:56,593
She indicated that that was a sacrifice
she would be willing to make.

139
00:08:56,593 --> 00:09:00,376
Well, that's laudable. She is willing
to give up a year of math homework,

140
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:02,805
to see that justice is served.

141
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:04,919
Just like mother, like daughter

142
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:12,248
Is that the door bell?

143
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:18,284
Is somebody at the door?

144
00:09:18,284 --> 00:09:20,406
Hello?

145
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:22,086
Can I help you?

146
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,515
Uncle Michael!

147
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:28,126
Uncle Michael!

148
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:31,217
Oh, who are you, guy?

149
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:36,887
- Why you couldn't call first?
- I know. I know. I
totally should have called.

150
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:40,369
But, I didn't even know that
I was gonna come here until last night.

151
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:42,852
- We talked about this.
- What was I supposed to do?

152
00:09:42,852 --> 00:09:47,697
She flew me out here first class.
I had a fully reclining seat and everything.

153
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:51,857
Oh, boy.
I know that look.

154
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:55,392
The look that I get from mom right before
she threw a shoe at me.

155
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:57,794
You are lucky,
we are nowhere near the closet.

156
00:09:57,794 --> 00:10:01,423
What's this about,
"I am not a psychic. I am an entertainer."?

157
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:06,044
Well, as it turns out being a psychic
in this particular incident, is paid a whole lot better.

158
00:10:06,044 --> 00:10:08,453
- How much better?
- Tons

159
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:15,623
Rental car, hotel room,
She sprung for a new communication's upgrade.

160
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:22,088
Come on, don't be like this.
I needed the money.

161
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,606
Besides, I can tell when
I was talking to her on the phone that

162
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:30,255
if I didn't come down here and
she would just gonna hire some other swami
to throw her guilt at.

163
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,637
Besides, when you are there to deal with
the devil that you know

164
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:39,078
Tell me exactly
what Mrs. King asked you to do.

165
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:41,827
I am supposed to go to her house,

166
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:45,083
walk around the scene,
touch some stuffs, see if I get anything.

167
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,413
- And that's it?
- That's it.

168
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:52,458
- She doesn't know I am a psychic.
- Ok.

169
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:56,393
And she can't know that we are related.
In fact, no one can.

170
00:10:56,393 --> 00:10:58,955
- Alright. I..
- No, this is serious.

171
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:01,276
I keep a low-profile with
the district attorney's office.

172
00:11:01,276 --> 00:11:04,806
I don't.. advertise what I do.
People wouldn't understand.

173
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:09,894
It can't get out that the King's
out of town psychic is my little brother.

174
00:11:09,894 --> 00:11:14,196
No problem. I just need you to do
one little tiny favor for me.

175
00:11:14,196 --> 00:11:15,531
And what's that?

176
00:11:15,531 --> 00:11:18,349
I sure could use a ride to
and from Mrs. King's in this morning

177
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:20,766
You just told me that
she gave you money for rent-a-car.

178
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:25,022
Yeah, well, but
if I don't spend it..

179
00:11:27,926 --> 00:11:30,826
Listen, this is not a mature business
that I am running here.

180
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:34,355
Every extra little penny helps
give me that edge.

181
00:11:34,355 --> 00:11:36,617
Oh, hell, I tell you what.
You call her,

182
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:40,501
you tell her that you contacted
the authorities when you landed this morning.

183
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:43,807
That they assigned me
to be your liaison to the police

184
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:48,281
Liaison, I like that. No impressure.

185
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:53,427
I am gonna get Joe up,
when I let him know you are here,

186
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:55,657
see if maybe I can get him
to drive the girls to school.

187
00:11:55,657 --> 00:11:58,945
There is one other little tiny thing
I needed to ask you.

188
00:11:58,945 --> 00:12:02,514
If no one is using the couch
I just like to pocket the hotel money, too

189
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,640
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, daddy.

190
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,363
Come on, kiddo, last stop.
Everyone off the bus.

191
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,899
Hey, there she is,
that's her, daddy!

192
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:18,612
Ah, the famous Mrs. Ubershire,
I presume.

193
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,683
So.. aren't you gonna go and talk to her?

194
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:25,074
- About what?
- About what she did to your window.

195
00:12:25,074 --> 00:12:28,405
Bridgette, I explained that to you last night.

196
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:31,024
But, she is right there!!

197
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:35,393
I know but, honey I can't accuse someone just
because you saw
something in the dream.

198
00:12:35,393 --> 00:12:37,995
But, I saw her, daddy!.

199
00:12:37,995 --> 00:12:41,086
She took a rock and
smashed your window with it.

200
00:12:41,086 --> 00:12:43,109
Ah, maybe she did and maybe she didn't.

201
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:47,040
But, I still can't accuse someone
just because you saw it in the dream.

202
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:51,084
Now, give me a kiss.
Come on.

203
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:55,181
Talk some more tonight.

204
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,815
Michael?

205
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:07,918
You look exactly how I imagined.

206
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:18,631
- Under watch, isn't he?
- I'm sorry?

207
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:25,169
This charade, I know my mother's
paying good money for it.

208
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:28,431
I swear if my dad were still alive.

209
00:13:28,431 --> 00:13:31,654
He'd have this guy out of the door
so fast, his head would spin.

210
00:13:33,507 --> 00:13:35,522
Mrs. Dubois?

211
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,973
Thank you.

212
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:42,328
Michael, tea?

213
00:13:42,997 --> 00:13:46,021
Ah, no. in a minute.

214
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:49,817
I am starting to feel sort of something.

215
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:56,675
Tell me.

216
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:58,554
Tell me, what you are feeling.

217
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:02,037
Um.. t's..  it's hard to put into words.

218
00:14:02,037 --> 00:14:06,366
Um.. different energies, different auras.

219
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,870
Ah..  it's very delicate work.

220
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:17,628
Well, what about the killer?

221
00:14:17,628 --> 00:14:21,516
Are you sensing anything about Gregory's killer?

222
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:30,226
I keep... I keep seeing the color blue?

223
00:14:30,226 --> 00:14:32,308
Does that mean anything to you?

224
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:35,192
Geez, maybe it was the mailman, mom.

225
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:37,551
Maybe he got tired of dad not
tipping him on Christmas.

226
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:39,898
Wes, please.

227
00:14:39,898 --> 00:14:45,498
- What else, Michael?
- You know what actually might help?

228
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:47,017
Lunch.

229
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:10,425
Will you be joining us for lunch,
Mrs. Dubois?

230
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:14,680
Ah, actually I think I prefer to step outside
and get some fresh air.

231
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,348
Mr. Benoit, can I see you outside for a moment?

232
00:15:19,348 --> 00:15:22,437
Outside? Absolutely.

233
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:28,067
Is there a something
where I can scrub up?

234
00:15:34,544 --> 00:15:37,254
Different auras, different energies.

235
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:42,296
Shame on you.

236
00:15:49,857 --> 00:15:52,844
Being a little tough on yourself, aren't you?

237
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:56,254
Give yourself some credit.
You got my wife eating out of your hand.

238
00:15:58,151 --> 00:15:59,842
Mr. King.

239
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:01,716
Gregory, yeah.

240
00:16:08,263 --> 00:16:09,805
Hey, sis.

241
00:16:09,805 --> 00:16:12,272
That was quite a performance
you gave in there, Carnac

242
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,722
So tell me what color is my aura now?

243
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:16,830
I don't know.

244
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,386
But, I think maybe we
need to call the police.

245
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:21,867
What?
What for?

246
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:23,596
Do you wanna know
how the killer looks like?

247
00:16:23,596 --> 00:16:26,851
Well, I have a fairly
detailed description of him

248
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:29,111
What? From who?

249
00:16:29,111 --> 00:16:33,737
I was just in the bathroom,
and so was Gregory King.

250
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:41,722
Henry Alonso, prior arrests include
possess of narcotics,

251
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:45,478
sale of the deadly weapon,
and the last but not least

252
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:49,497
Um.. breaking and entering.

253
00:16:50,832 --> 00:16:55,000
Are you sure? Are you certain this is
the man that Gregory King described you?

254
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,966
No, I am not sure. I mean,
it was a description, not a photograph.

255
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:01,575
But you've got to admit
that it's kind of freaky that,

256
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:07,136
this guy he described has all the qualifications
necessary for careers of a thief and a killer.

257
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:09,346
He makes a good point.

258
00:17:09,346 --> 00:17:13,668
I think I'll see if Mr. Alonso's around,
maybe invite him down for a little chat.

259
00:17:14,894 --> 00:17:16,647
Hi, dad.

260
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:19,235
- Hey.
- Where's mom?

261
00:17:19,235 --> 00:17:21,568
She's working, I thought
you're walking home with Hannah today.

262
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:25,289
I am. I'm just here to deliver a message
from the principal. / Ok.

263
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:27,796
He wants to see you.

264
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,120
Something about Bridgette.

265
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,362
You understand Mr. Dubois that
she said it in front of the entire class.

266
00:17:32,362 --> 00:17:35,269
And now she absolutely refuses to apologize.

267
00:17:40,043 --> 00:17:43,741
Mrs. Ubershire.
I would like you to meet Bridgette's father.

268
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:47,131
- Hi, Joe. Joe Dubois.
- Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

269
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:52,096
Likewise, and I am very sorry,
if my daughter has said anything to upset you.

270
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:55,424
As I am sure, you've noticed
she has a very vivid imagination.

271
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:57,963
In my experience, Mr. Dubois,

272
00:17:57,963 --> 00:18:01,710
it's not a parents' job
to apologize for their child.

273
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:07,374
It's parents' job to make sure their child
can apologize for herself.

274
00:18:10,114 --> 00:18:13,572
Bridgette, don't you have something
that you wanna say to Mrs. Ubershire?

275
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,399
Bridgette, we talked about this.

276
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:26,071
You don't know what actually happened.

277
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:31,341
Young lady, apologize.
Right now.

278
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,046
I'm sorry, Mrs. Ubershire.

279
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:39,760
I'm sorry that I said you broke
my daddy's window.

280
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,516
I guess I don't know
what really happened.

281
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:45,361
Thank you, Bridgette.

282
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:46,923
Thank you, both.

283
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:50,087
Come on, sweetie.

284
00:18:53,794 --> 00:18:58,311
I..um.. put some clean sheets and
towels on the couch,

285
00:18:58,311 --> 00:19:01,229
we.. don't have a spare toothbrush.

286
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:03,046
Looks like we are gonna have to buy you one.

287
00:19:03,046 --> 00:19:07,447
No, I'll just.. use this toothbrush God gave me.

288
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:13,308
- Well, I thought you said you were thirsty.
- No, I was..

289
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,493
- I am.
- And?

290
00:19:18,493 --> 00:19:22,753
I was just thinking about how one 
of those always leads to another.

291
00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:25,356
And another, and another.

292
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:30,197
And I remembered you said
that makes it harder to feel stuff.

293
00:19:30,197 --> 00:19:31,810
See things.

294
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:35,752
Hey.
It really shook you up seeing Gregory King.

295
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,666
Oh.

296
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:49,609
Hello?

297
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:51,756
It's Scanlon.
He's right here.

298
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:54,360
They picked up Henry Alonso.

299
00:19:56,223 --> 00:19:58,295
He was high as a kite.

300
00:19:58,295 --> 00:20:02,177
He pawned a 5 carat diamond ring,
and a diamond face watch.

301
00:20:02,177 --> 00:20:05,417
Both stolen from Gregory King the night he died.

302
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:09,065
Yeah, he is smiling.

303
00:20:09,065 --> 00:20:10,525
Ok.

304
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:13,202
- Hey.
- Yes!

305
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,906
How did it go?

306
00:20:16,906 --> 00:20:18,472
She's still mad at me.?

307
00:20:18,472 --> 00:20:22,232
Well, she still thinks what
she had dreamt was a truth, so I guess so.

308
00:20:26,496 --> 00:20:30,840
How about our fourth child?
The big lump living on the couch?

309
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,825
He fell asleep watching TV.

310
00:20:32,825 --> 00:20:35,047
Fell asleep or passed out?

311
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:39,252
I'll have you know he didn't drink
anything stronger
than orange juice today.

312
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:40,601
Geez

313
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:45,434
The guy cracks one
lousy murder case and
suddenly he's the
poster child for sobriety

314
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:49,152
Hey! He did good!
I, for one, am proud.

315
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:52,579
Ok, you would..

316
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:56,327
If I see him out of our living room,
I'll be proud of him, too

317
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:06,137
Hold on a second.

318
00:21:06,137 --> 00:21:09,282
- Stop it!
- Hey

319
00:21:09,282 --> 00:21:12,684
Hey, where are you going?
Get back here.

320
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,792
Oh, my God.
You are him.

321
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,739
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

322
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:30,353
Oh, my God.

323
00:21:30,353 --> 00:21:34,260
You knew who I was.
from the moment, you walked in.

324
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,898
Before you even
bought me that first drink.

325
00:21:39,662 --> 00:21:42,556
- Hey, how do you like if we finish here?
- No.. no..

326
00:22:01,642 --> 00:22:04,162
Good morning.

327
00:22:04,722 --> 00:22:07,759
Dude, what is it with you and bathrooms?

328
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,719
Well, where would you prefer we meet?

329
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:13,042
Around the breakfast table,
with your sister and the kids?

330
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:15,858
No
I get that

331
00:22:15,858 --> 00:22:17,940
So, did you hear we caught your killer?

332
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:23,104
I certainly did, I couldn't be more grateful
for all your help with that, truly.

333
00:22:24,412 --> 00:22:26,638
There's just one more thing that
I need you to do.

334
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:29,204
Great.

335
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:30,588
Mike!!

336
00:22:30,588 --> 00:22:32,616
Michael!

337
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:35,989
They're bringing Henry Alonso in
to give a statement in a couple of hours.

338
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:38,260
They wanna know,
if Michael and I wanna sit in.

339
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,975
You and Michael?

340
00:22:39,975 --> 00:22:41,285
That's nice, that's thoughtful.

341
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:43,976
Yeah, well, he is the person
who led them to him.

342
00:22:43,976 --> 00:22:47,768
I mean, I think it'll mean a lot to him.
You know, seeing it through the end.

343
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:49,088
Mike!

344
00:22:57,847 --> 00:23:00,523
Well, that's weird.
He's not here.

345
00:23:01,221 --> 00:23:03,955
Hey, Mr. King, I'm sorry to drop by
so early in the morning.

346
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,266
My mom isn't here,
she is at the funeral home.

347
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:11,159
But, that's ok.
I.. came here to see you.

348
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:16,340
I have a message from your dad.

349
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,880
He asked me to..

350
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,530
Look, since my dad never had a whole
lot to say to me while he was alive,

351
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:26,155
I find it kind of hard to believe
he is so desperate

352
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,253
to reach me now that he's dead.

353
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:29,848
Much less through a perfect stranger

354
00:23:29,848 --> 00:23:33,627
Well, you know, ok, that's funny because
he was telling me the story

355
00:23:33,627 --> 00:23:35,878
about when you were five maybe.

356
00:23:35,878 --> 00:23:40,694
He said that you and he were in his dinghy
on the way out to his sailboat.

357
00:23:40,694 --> 00:23:43,237
You slipped on a railing,
hit your head on a winch,

358
00:23:43,237 --> 00:23:46,648
started bleeding like a stuck pig
You needed seven stitches.

359
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:53,324
You saw the scar on my head and
did some kind of internet search

360
00:23:53,324 --> 00:23:56,488
to dig up my old
hospital records or something.

361
00:23:56,488 --> 00:23:58,111
I am very impressed.
Ok?

362
00:23:58,111 --> 00:24:01,311
But, like I said, my mom will be back later.
Why don't you..

363
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:06,741
Your father said when he picked you up,
he saw your face covered with all
that blood and he said "Wesley, suck it up"

364
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:09,434
"You need to taste blood, if you wanna be a man."

365
00:24:09,434 --> 00:24:15,848
And then he said,
"What a stupid thing to say to a 5-year-old.

366
00:24:15,848 --> 00:24:18,360
One of my life's greatest regrets".

367
00:24:20,646 --> 00:24:25,101
The kid needed a hug, and I did
a bad Hemingway impression.

368
00:24:32,283 --> 00:24:35,282
I've always felt this glare on me.

369
00:24:35,282 --> 00:24:42,045
It was like.. nothing I did..
was ever right.

370
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:45,897
My work, my friends, women I dated.

371
00:24:45,897 --> 00:24:49,759
Well, it's not like he feels that way now.

372
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:52,261
In fact, your father
wanted me to tell you and

373
00:24:52,261 --> 00:24:55,103
he said that you would know what
he was talking about,

374
00:24:55,103 --> 00:25:00,465
that he would never let anyone tell him
who he could or could not be with.

375
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,768
And you should do the same thing.

376
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:05,196
Does that make any sense to you?

377
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:10,436
Oh, good.

378
00:25:10,436 --> 00:25:12,819
Because it's really
important to your father.

379
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:15,563
And he told me that he
wanted you to know that

380
00:25:15,563 --> 00:25:19,922
whatever objections he had before are gone.

381
00:25:21,124 --> 00:25:23,330
He said that you would know what that meant.

382
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,324
Good.

383
00:25:29,324 --> 00:25:32,267
Your father is counting on you, Wesley.

384
00:25:32,267 --> 00:25:37,518
He wants you to take
control, secure his legacy.

385
00:25:38,883 --> 00:25:42,090
He told me that he
sees himself in you now,

386
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,511
in the way that he never did before.

387
00:25:48,627 --> 00:25:50,430
Oh.

388
00:26:04,633 --> 00:26:07,350
- See you, dad.
- Bye, daddy.

389
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,851
Hey, what, no kiss today?

390
00:26:14,245 --> 00:26:16,791
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

391
00:26:24,232 --> 00:26:26,234
Relax, just a minute.

392
00:26:41,304 --> 00:26:44,552
He was like a totally different person.

393
00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:47,654
Only now he knows his dad felt that way,

394
00:26:47,654 --> 00:26:50,856
getting the message
from beyond the grave.

395
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:52,832
It's like you transformed him.

396
00:26:52,832 --> 00:26:55,469
It looks like it did you some good, too.

397
00:26:55,469 --> 00:26:59,123
I'm sorry that I didn't let you aware
where I was going.

398
00:26:59,123 --> 00:27:02,343
I was just..

399
00:27:03,145 --> 00:27:06,335
But, after seeing Mr. King,

400
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:09,025
helping him reconcile to make
things right with this kid?

401
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,220
Catching the killer?

402
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:17,852
It's been an amazing couple of days.

403
00:27:20,245 --> 00:27:23,944
By the way, I am not completely
convinced about the whole..

404
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:25,944
"finding the killer" thing.

405
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:29,256
What are you talking about? Allison?

406
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:32,353
What.. we found him, I found him.

407
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:36,674
He is found, we're driving over
there to hear his confession right now..

408
00:27:36,674 --> 00:27:40,543
Don't.. don't mess this up for me,

409
00:27:40,543 --> 00:27:44,055
it's over, this is happened.
It's past tense.

410
00:27:44,055 --> 00:27:47,067
A trivia question to stout.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

411
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:49,972
Yeah, I do.
It's just, I had a dream,

412
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:54,439
and your friend Mr. King was in it
with a woman. A very young woman.

413
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,359
Her name was Monica,
she was not.. his wife.

414
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:01,905
They were at his place and she seemed
completely out of place there,

415
00:28:01,905 --> 00:28:06,246
I mean she had a tattoo, a barb-wire around her arm.

416
00:28:06,246 --> 00:28:10,405
They started arguing
and then it got violent.

417
00:28:15,024 --> 00:28:17,880
What's in here is gotta do with
price rise in China, Allison?

418
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,747
I don't know,

419
00:28:20,747 --> 00:28:23,020
Why am I seeing it? Why?

420
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,703
I mean, if this case is really over,
why am I still dreaming about?

421
00:28:26,703 --> 00:28:29,132
What difference does it make?

422
00:28:29,132 --> 00:28:31,239
What are you gonna pay attention to,
some dumb dream?

423
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:33,697
Or your brother, who's sitting right
in front of you telling you

424
00:28:33,697 --> 00:28:38,411
that he had a close
encounter in the bathroom
with forces from the other side.

425
00:28:41,883 --> 00:28:44,616
You ran on my parade.

426
00:28:44,616 --> 00:28:49,863
I was passed out in the alley behind
the warehouse on Pine Street.

427
00:28:49,863 --> 00:28:53,687
I woke up when I heard a car pulling up

428
00:28:53,687 --> 00:28:58,464
You saw some guy toss a
fourty-thousand dollar watch
and a five carat ring into a dumpster.

429
00:28:58,464 --> 00:29:01,247
I'm just telling you what I saw.

430
00:29:03,998 --> 00:29:06,234
Can you tell me the
maker and model of the car?

431
00:29:06,234 --> 00:29:08,927
Can you describe the driver?
Can you tell me anything that makes

432
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:11,685
what you were saying sound
even the slightest bit credible..

433
00:29:11,685 --> 00:29:13,510
I don't know. I don't remember.

434
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,078
This is so the guy..

435
00:29:17,126 --> 00:29:19,115
Ah, can you believe it?

436
00:29:19,115 --> 00:29:23,116
I swear. After this,
after they close this case,

437
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:26,791
I wanna find this friend of mine
from the army, he's LAPD now.

438
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:32,776
I think that I can convince him to take me
on as a consultant, just like you.

439
00:29:41,061 --> 00:29:43,938
I can't believe you are doing this.

440
00:29:43,938 --> 00:29:46,488
I'm sorry, doing what?

441
00:29:47,837 --> 00:29:51,018
You're jealous.. Aren't you?

442
00:29:51,018 --> 00:29:52,772
What are you talking about?

443
00:29:52,772 --> 00:29:58,167
Well, I guess there'll only be one official
secret police psychic in this family, huh?

444
00:29:59,153 --> 00:30:00,891
Official secret police psychic.

445
00:30:00,891 --> 00:30:03,493
You know what I am talking about, Allison.

446
00:30:03,493 --> 00:30:06,726
I didn't crack this case, I smashed it.

447
00:30:06,726 --> 00:30:10,489
They found this guy red-handed with
all the stuff from Mr. King's house.

448
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:14,473
I've got him dead to right.
It's driving you crazy.

449
00:30:14,473 --> 00:30:17,464
It's not making me crazy.
Nothing is making me crazy.

450
00:30:17,464 --> 00:30:21,824
I look at this man,
I listen to the theory of his crime,

451
00:30:21,824 --> 00:30:24,879
- I am not sure I believe it.
- That's because you don't want to believe it.

452
00:30:24,879 --> 00:30:29,383
Because it means that your little brother,
Michael has got it all going on, just like you.

453
00:30:29,383 --> 00:30:32,517
Just like you.

454
00:30:34,025 --> 00:30:35,962
Just like you.

455
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:38,778
Where are you going?

456
00:30:38,778 --> 00:30:41,362
I am going to spend some of
that hotel money, that's where.

457
00:30:49,868 --> 00:30:51,693
You are absolutely sure.

458
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,236
It's not remotely possible.

459
00:30:54,236 --> 00:30:57,503
Ok, well, thank you very much for
that information, Doctor

460
00:30:58,795 --> 00:31:01,962
- Doctor?
- County medical examiner.

461
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:06,914
Apparently, Gregory King
was definitely killed by a man.

462
00:31:07,976 --> 00:31:09,581
They can tell that just from an autopsy?

463
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:12,546
From the severity of the wounds
and their location on the body.

464
00:31:12,546 --> 00:31:14,910
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

465
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:19,123
Now they're positive Gregory King was
definitely killed by a man who
was at least 5 foot 8.

466
00:31:19,123 --> 00:31:23,778
So he couldn't have been killed by
a petite 20 something named Monica?

467
00:31:23,778 --> 00:31:26,335
- Apparently not.
- Um..

468
00:31:26,335 --> 00:31:28,278
- So, did you call him yet?
- My brother?

469
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:31,309
About 40 times,
he just doesn't answer the phone.

470
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:35,082
I'm gonna take a shower.

471
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:43,507
Hello?

472
00:31:43,507 --> 00:31:45,923
Yes, he is, May I ask who's calling?

473
00:31:48,643 --> 00:31:51,191
It's Laurie Jameson in the
neighbourhood watch group

474
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:54,350
Hello? Laurie

475
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,915
Michael.

476
00:32:00,915 --> 00:32:03,696
Thank you so much for stopping
by on your way to the airport.

477
00:32:03,696 --> 00:32:05,891
I wanted to be able to say thank you in person.

478
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:08,014
Wha.. ah, you don't need to thank me.

479
00:32:08,014 --> 00:32:09,526
You know, you paid me to do a job,

480
00:32:09,526 --> 00:32:12,598
I'm just happy that I was
actually able to do it for you.

481
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:15,511
Oh, Michael.

482
00:32:15,511 --> 00:32:16,891
Come in.

483
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:21,396
Michael.

484
00:32:21,396 --> 00:32:24,530
You did so much more than
I ever could have imagined.

485
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:28,182
Those messages that you brought us from my late husband.

486
00:32:28,182 --> 00:32:32,851
You couldn't possibly know this,
but they've changed everything.

487
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:36,149
- Ah, what're you talking about?
- Oh, please.

488
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:38,315
Come, I want you.. I want you to meet someone.

489
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:40,526
I want you to meet my son's fiance.

490
00:32:41,397 --> 00:32:44,699
Michael.
This is Monica.

491
00:32:44,699 --> 00:32:49,683
Hi, nice to meet you.

492
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:56,002
Tell them you need to use the bathroom.
Do it.

493
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:06,200
You looked puzzled out there.

494
00:33:07,616 --> 00:33:11,868
You knew her. Monica,
you knew that woman, didn't you?

495
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:15,370
Run some water.
They can't hear me,
but they can hear you.

496
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:20,844
She killed you, didn't she?
You and her had a thing.

497
00:33:20,844 --> 00:33:23,567
- She killed you.
- Do you like that story?

498
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:27,590
Me? Personally,
I prefer the Henry Alonso's story.

499
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,319
Yeah, that's a great story.

500
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:32,350
You got a sympathetic victim.
Me.

501
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:36,617
You have a villain, we can all rule against

502
00:33:36,617 --> 00:33:39,660
unemployed drug addict with a criminal record.

503
00:33:40,737 --> 00:33:44,174
And we have the added
bonus of your involvement.

504
00:33:44,174 --> 00:33:47,823
No small thing as far as
my wife's concerned.

505
00:33:47,823 --> 00:33:50,090
I'm asking you a direct question.

506
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,494
Henry Alonso killed me.
You close the case.

507
00:33:53,494 --> 00:33:55,549
Take the win and go home.

508
00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:57,990
Ok, I'm gonna go out there,
tell them Monica killed you.

509
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,466
- I wish you wouldn't.
- Why? Because it's true?

510
00:34:01,466 --> 00:34:04,509
Because he loves her.

511
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,559
And because it isn't true.

512
00:34:07,768 --> 00:34:11,098
You know, Mr. Gregory,
I am gonna be honest with you.

513
00:34:11,098 --> 00:34:13,949
The more time I spend with you,
the less I seem to like you.

514
00:34:14,703 --> 00:34:19,902
But you are my first real
for profit visitation from the other side,

515
00:34:19,902 --> 00:34:22,355
So that counts for something.

516
00:34:22,355 --> 00:34:25,205
I am gonna ask you one more time.

517
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:29,173
If it isn't Henry Alonso,
and it isn't your son's fiance, then who?

518
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:39,324
- Did Wesley know about the two of you?
- There was no two of us.

519
00:34:39,324 --> 00:34:42,955
I thought my son was weak, feckless.

520
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,204
I was trying to protect him.

521
00:34:45,204 --> 00:34:47,861
By seducing his girlfriend.

522
00:34:47,861 --> 00:34:51,196
I thought I had to prove something to him.

523
00:34:51,196 --> 00:34:54,631
About his girlfriend's character.

524
00:34:54,631 --> 00:34:59,417
Instead, I found something else about his.

525
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:04,284
She told him, didn't she?
She told Wesley that you tried.

526
00:35:04,284 --> 00:35:06,841
One of the real secrets of
my success and business,

527
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:10,998
has always been my ability to sell anything,

528
00:35:10,998 --> 00:35:15,017
almost anything to,
almost anyone and anytime.

529
00:35:15,017 --> 00:35:18,117
But I could not convince that boy.

530
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:21,558
That the girl he is in love with, was lying.

531
00:35:22,644 --> 00:35:27,153
Oh, my God.
He did it.

532
00:35:27,905 --> 00:35:30,239
Your own son.

533
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:38,749
I honestly can't even
begin to describe you
that collision of emotions, I mean.

534
00:35:38,749 --> 00:35:40,640
You are staring at your own death.

535
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,694
And yet, I didn't think
he had them in him.

536
00:35:43,694 --> 00:35:47,320
I mean, the way
he made it look like robbery.

537
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,351
Take my watch and ring,
and throw them in that dumpster.

538
00:35:50,351 --> 00:35:52,746
I am not sure I could
have come up with that.

539
00:35:52,746 --> 00:35:55,503
I am gonna have to
tell him, you know that.

540
00:35:56,953 --> 00:36:01,220
Seven four two zero five.

541
00:36:02,379 --> 00:36:06,475
What? / That's half the routing
number of an account in a bank in Malaga

542
00:36:06,475 --> 00:36:09,223
You'll get the other half,
when you arrive in Spain.

543
00:36:09,223 --> 00:36:14,234
There's exactly $349,000 in that account,
I'm the only one who knows about it.

544
00:36:15,267 --> 00:36:17,825
That's enough for you to start having a real life.

545
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:20,413
To make something of yourself.

546
00:36:20,413 --> 00:36:25,353
Just.. let a father give his son in death

547
00:36:25,353 --> 00:36:27,953
What he couldn't in life.

548
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:30,210
And let this innocent man go to jail.

549
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:34,998
The question here isn't about Henry Alonso

550
00:36:34,998 --> 00:36:37,926
It's about Michael Benoit.

551
00:36:37,926 --> 00:36:40,634
Is he going to walk away from
this experience as a rich man?

552
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:44,841
Or is he going back to work
at that 900 phone lines.

553
00:36:52,465 --> 00:36:55,777
Mrs. Ubershire.

554
00:36:55,777 --> 00:37:00,233
- Joe Dubois, we met the other day.
- Ah, yes, of course.

555
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:02,605
What can I do for you, Mr. Dubois?

556
00:37:02,605 --> 00:37:05,769
Well, I was just wondering
how do you like you car.

557
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:09,812
Because I really love mine,
I love everything about it.
Even the color is perfect.

558
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:12,837
You went for the metallic brown too,
didn't you?

559
00:37:12,837 --> 00:37:16,926
Is there something I can
help you with, Mr. Dubois?

560
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:22,812
Well, I am guessing Ubershire
isn't the most common of names.

561
00:37:22,812 --> 00:37:26,088
Would it surprise you to learn that we got one
living on our street?

562
00:37:26,088 --> 00:37:30,022
I, myself didn't know until I check with
my neighbourhood watch this morning.

563
00:37:30,022 --> 00:37:33,178
Glaudis Ubershire,
she moved in a few months ago.

564
00:37:33,178 --> 00:37:36,160
Just a couple of doors down from our house.

565
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,335
I went over to
introduce myself
this morning,
and then..

566
00:37:39,335 --> 00:37:42,418
It turns out she's got a sister-in-law
who teaches at this school.

567
00:37:42,418 --> 00:37:45,657
Yeah, the sister-in-law came over for dinner
last Sunday night

568
00:37:45,657 --> 00:37:51,796
Same night, somebody smashed
the window of mine.
Metallic brown '04 Jeep Cherokee

569
00:37:51,796 --> 00:37:54,000
You got it mixed up, right?

570
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,005
You tried to put your key in my jeep,
and then when the door wouldn't open,

571
00:37:58,005 --> 00:38:01,741
You broke the window to get inside.

572
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:04,807
You probably didn't even figure out
your mistake until

573
00:38:04,807 --> 00:38:07,895
the key wouldn't work
in the ignition, either.

574
00:38:09,415 --> 00:38:12,225
Here, this is the bill

575
00:38:12,225 --> 00:38:15,147
What it costed me to fix the window
that you smashed.

576
00:38:15,147 --> 00:38:19,608
All the time, all the upset,
it's on the house.

577
00:38:19,608 --> 00:38:24,217
You.. you actually expect me to pay that?

578
00:38:24,217 --> 00:38:28,767
A parents' job, Mrs. Ubershire,
is to listen to their child.

579
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:32,663
Bridgette is telling me that
I ought to go to the police on this.

580
00:38:32,663 --> 00:38:35,438
Maybe she is right about that, too.

581
00:38:39,612 --> 00:38:42,485
Hey, official secret police psychic.

582
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:47,513
Can I ask you a question?

583
00:38:48,177 --> 00:38:50,674
How are we gonna get
Henry Alonso out of the jail?

584
00:38:52,346 --> 00:38:55,923
Mr. King, I was starting to worry
you weren't gonna make it. / Sorry.

585
00:38:55,923 --> 00:38:59,137
I was.. in a meeting with some of
the partners of my dad's company,

586
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:02,989
Trying to figure out where
I fit in the new hierarchy.

587
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:06,652
You said that the district attorney
had some questions for me.

588
00:39:06,652 --> 00:39:09,494
He is just finishing up with
someone in the conference room.

589
00:39:09,494 --> 00:39:11,374
This way.

590
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,795
Monica?

591
00:39:21,795 --> 00:39:25,091
Oh.. I'm so sorry, Wes.

592
00:39:25,091 --> 00:39:28,761
They knew everything.
I couldn't lie.

593
00:39:28,761 --> 00:39:31,852
I don't understand
what you are talking about.

594
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:35,585
- Monica!
- I'm sorry. / Monica!

595
00:39:35,585 --> 00:39:37,336
What did you tell them?

596
00:39:39,621 --> 00:39:42,021
Does someone please want to tell me
what the hell is going on here?

597
00:39:42,021 --> 00:39:45,038
Your fiance was just
telling us about the night
your father tried to seduce her.

598
00:39:45,038 --> 00:39:49,317
She said she came
clean with you about it
just hours before he was killed.

599
00:39:49,317 --> 00:39:54,242
I guess she just decided
she'd rather have a clear conscience than
being accessory to murder.

600
00:39:55,446 --> 00:39:57,292
Now, if you wouldn't mind, Mr. King,

601
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:59,838
we have a lot,
we would like to discuss it with you.

602
00:40:05,157 --> 00:40:07,165
Excuse me. Wesley?
Can we have a
statement right here please?

603
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,551
What a waste.

604
00:40:16,143 --> 00:40:20,100
- You're still here.
- I gave that boy everything.

605
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,395
I tried to make him a man,
here he is.. blubbering to the cops.

606
00:40:23,395 --> 00:40:28,137
Well, if it's any consolation,
my sister says he'll probably get a manslaughter.

607
00:40:28,137 --> 00:40:31,534
Yeah, with good behavior, five years?

608
00:40:31,534 --> 00:40:35,077
Yeah, right.
Knowing him, he would be a model prisoner.

609
00:40:35,077 --> 00:40:37,454
And you. You're no better.

610
00:40:37,454 --> 00:40:40,254
I offered you a
chance of a whole new life,

611
00:40:40,254 --> 00:40:41,997
I hope you are happy.

612
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:46,246
Actually, I am.

613
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:52,219
Well, I've got to go.
I just spotted my ride to the airport

614
00:40:53,028 --> 00:40:56,676
I'm guessing you've got
some traveling of your own with you.

615
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,290
Pack for warm weather.

616
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,454
Family
