1
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:21,001
It's almost 2:00.

2
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:23,433
You fellows want
to round up the groom?

3
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:34,433
Bachelor Number One,
you're up!

4
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,367
Hey, Don Juan!

5
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:40,168
Your new ball-and-chain
is waiting.

6
00:00:40,234 --> 00:00:41,567
What do you say?

7
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:51,001
Come on, man.

8
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:53,001
Time to flush and go.

9
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:55,168
Your future ex is waiting.

10
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:56,567
You find him?

11
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:00,767
I think he's wringing it out.

12
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:05,801
Come on, man.
What's the deal?

13
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:07,467
You fall in?

14
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:09,667
You okay?

15
00:01:12,234 --> 00:01:13,867
Knock it down.

16
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:16,867
I'm coming in, man.

17
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:28,467
Oh, man.

18
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:29,967
What are you doing?

19
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:44,168
Talk to me.

20
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:46,168
No. It's nothing.

21
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:47,901
Nonsense.

22
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:51,934
Nonsense.

23
00:03:14,954 --> 00:03:18,220
Rise and shine.

24
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:19,554
Up and at 'em.

25
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:22,821
Morning.

26
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:24,721
School. Yay.

27
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:27,921
No fair, sweet pea.

28
00:03:27,988 --> 00:03:29,988
I just called in your room
for you to wake up.

29
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:33,054
How long have you been out here?

30
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
I don't know.

31
00:03:34,187 --> 00:03:35,187
I couldn't sleep.

32
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:37,520
I have to do
this oral presentation

33
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:40,754
on the history of anti-
discrimination legislation

34
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:41,787
and I know I'm not

35
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:42,988
going to do
very well.

36
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:44,153
You don't know that.

37
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,220
Oh, yes, I do.

38
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:46,487
There are kids in my class

39
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:48,153
that have been working
on theirs for weeks.

40
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,587
Weeks, Ariel?

41
00:03:50,654 --> 00:03:52,287
Doesn't actually
require weeks.

42
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:54,088
It's just, some kids are nuts.

43
00:03:54,153 --> 00:03:55,921
Besides that it's just

44
00:03:55,988 --> 00:03:57,187
some kind of contest.

45
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:58,520
The top three kids
in our school

46
00:03:58,587 --> 00:04:00,187
get to go to the state assembly

47
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:02,287
and make their presentations
in front of our assemblyman.

48
00:04:02,354 --> 00:04:04,354
Wow.

49
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,554
Mom, you don't get it.

50
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,554
I don't care.

51
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:10,454
But a lot
of the other kids do.

52
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,287
And that's just going
to make me look worse.

53
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,220
I'm sure you're
going to do fine.

54
00:04:17,287 --> 00:04:19,320
That's Mr. Cathcart's
class, right?

55
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:20,787
You always do
well in there.

56
00:04:20,854 --> 00:04:21,787
He likes you.

57
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:23,721
Good morning.

58
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:28,120
Or am I being hasty?

59
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:42,687
DEVALOS:
We believe they were mules--

60
00:04:42,754 --> 00:04:44,354
impoverished foreign nationals

61
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,021
hired by drug dealers to swallow
condoms filled with heroin,

62
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:50,120
then fly over to this country
on commercial jetliners

63
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:52,687
and wait in hotel rooms
to expel the drugs.

64
00:04:52,754 --> 00:04:55,088
What happened
to their eyes?

65
00:04:55,153 --> 00:04:56,153
Gouged out.

66
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,854
Someone's trying
to send a message.

67
00:04:57,921 --> 00:04:59,520
I don't follow.

68
00:04:59,587 --> 00:05:00,854
DEVALOS:
Drugs are a
cyclical business.

69
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:02,621
One group will control
the trafficking for a while,

70
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:04,320
then somebody else
will decide it's their turn.

71
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,988
I'm betting whoever

72
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:07,954
that somebody is that he grabbed
these mules at the airport

73
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,587
before their real employer
could get to them.

74
00:05:09,654 --> 00:05:10,921
Took them to that hotel.

75
00:05:10,988 --> 00:05:12,454
Sliced 'em in half,
rather than wait

76
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,988
for nature to deliver
the merchandise,

77
00:05:14,054 --> 00:05:15,054
then ripped
out their eyes

78
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,354
just for good measure.

79
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,654
Detective Scanlon
has quite a bit

80
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:19,354
of experience
in these matters.

81
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,088
Three years ago he headed
up an undercover unit

82
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:22,287
that helped stem a great deal
of drug trafficking

83
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:23,754
here in the Southwest.

84
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:25,253
Well, good.
Then maybe he can tell me

85
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,887
how much more of this
we can expect.

86
00:05:26,954 --> 00:05:28,520
It's not like the weather.

87
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:29,921
No one can tell you

88
00:05:29,988 --> 00:05:31,687
when it's going to blow over.

89
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:33,921
I think what our new
deputy mayor is asking...
I know what she's asking.

90
00:05:33,988 --> 00:05:35,587
She wants to know how messy
it's going to get:

91
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:37,187
if we keep it downtown

92
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,887
where nobody really sees it,
where nobody really cares,

93
00:05:38,954 --> 00:05:40,287
or if it's gonna rear
its ugly head

94
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:41,487
in the nice neighborhoods

95
00:05:41,554 --> 00:05:42,821
where people actually
go to the polls

96
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:43,887
and sometimes even make

97
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:46,387
campaign
contributions.

98
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:51,320
We'll do our best.

99
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,587
Hi.

100
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:56,921
Hiya.

101
00:05:58,921 --> 00:06:00,754
So how goes the new job?

102
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:02,253
Well, it would go a lot better

103
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,988
if people would stop
killing people.

104
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:10,088
Hey, Deputy Doll,
how's the coffee?

105
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:11,187
Could you not?

106
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:13,721
Hmm? Could I not "what"?

107
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:15,954
It's important to be
specific about these things.

108
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:17,821
There's all kinds of laws
about how to deal

109
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:19,387
with the opposite sex
in the workplace

110
00:06:19,454 --> 00:06:22,420
and I don't want to run
afoul of any of them.

111
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:28,687
You can see the future.

112
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:29,687
What are my chances?

113
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:31,220
You're not serious.

114
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:32,721
What? You don't think
I was charming?

115
00:06:32,787 --> 00:06:34,187
It really doesn't matter

116
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:35,520
what I think.

117
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:37,554
You're wrong. She's in
the elevator right now

118
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:38,587
calling her best friend

119
00:06:38,654 --> 00:06:39,988
trying to figure
out what to wear

120
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:42,554
when I finally
ask her out.

121
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:43,787
What? That's not
what you see?

122
00:06:43,854 --> 00:06:45,220
You want to know
what I see?

123
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:47,220
Actually. I had a dream
about you last night.

124
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:48,354
A really crazy dream.

125
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,487
I have that effect

126
00:06:49,554 --> 00:06:51,021
on women.

127
00:06:51,088 --> 00:06:52,320
I was not in it.

128
00:06:52,387 --> 00:06:54,021
A nightmare. I understand.

129
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:55,621
You were getting married.

130
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:56,687
Really?

131
00:06:56,754 --> 00:06:58,253
<i>That is a nightmare.</i>

132
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,821
You were so upset
with going through with it

133
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,854
that you hid in the bathroom
and did drugs.

134
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,854
Okay, get to
the crazy part.

135
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:05,520
<i>That is crazy. It is.</i>

136
00:07:05,587 --> 00:07:08,187
Do I look like a guy who's
ever contemplated marriage?

137
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:10,287
Do I look like a guy
who's ever done drugs?

138
00:07:10,354 --> 00:07:13,520
Okay, I'm going back
to the station house.

139
00:07:13,587 --> 00:07:16,253
Wait for a call
from the deputy mayor.

140
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:20,387
...and so we have all of
these anti-discrimination laws

141
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:22,988
that make America
a better place to live.

142
00:07:23,054 --> 00:07:24,587
Very nice, Ariel.

143
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:28,887
Terrence Bock.

144
00:07:38,287 --> 00:07:39,754
Do you see all those cards?

145
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:56,921
Terrence?

146
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:02,387
The history of discrimination
in the United States

147
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:04,021
and the progression
of legislative remedies

148
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:06,220
created by the various
branches of government

149
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:08,320
assigned the task
of safeguarding the rights

150
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:11,253
of each and every citizen
provides a moving portrait

151
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,787
of contemporary democracy
in action.

152
00:08:17,088 --> 00:08:20,754
In the next 15 minutes,
I will attempt to demonstrate

153
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:24,054
how the constant evolution
of anti-discrimination laws

154
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,253
in the United States
has helped to change

155
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,253
the way we live as Americans.

156
00:08:33,354 --> 00:08:39,454
1,095 days without drugs.

157
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,220
Three years.

158
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:47,487
Everyone in this room knows
what a monumental event that is.

159
00:08:47,554 --> 00:08:51,054
It's quite a milestone
for this man.

160
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,088
And I couldn't be more proud.

161
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:55,487
Lee?

162
00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:57,153
Here's a little
something for you

163
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,821
to add to your charm bracelet.

164
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:14,621
My name's Lee.
I'm a drug addict.

165
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,587
ALL:
Hi, Lee.

166
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:38,754
Is everything okay?

167
00:10:40,387 --> 00:10:43,854
Yeah. I don't know.

168
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:48,120
I guess...
I guess I had a nightmare.

169
00:10:48,187 --> 00:10:53,521
Wow. I don't think I've ever
heard you use that word before.

170
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:56,787
Detective Scanlon was in it.

171
00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:59,921
His eyes were gouged out.

172
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:02,254
Like those women
in the newspaper?

173
00:11:04,754 --> 00:11:06,754
What you doing?

174
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:08,254
Hmm?

175
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,787
I don't know.

176
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:12,153
I think maybe
I should give him a call.

177
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,120
And tell him what?

178
00:11:14,187 --> 00:11:16,220
About some nightmare?

179
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:18,888
It's 2:00
in the morning.

180
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:22,487
No. You're right.

181
00:11:22,554 --> 00:11:24,120
What was I thinking?

182
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:28,888
It'll hold till morning.

183
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:32,787
It'll definitely hold
till morning.

184
00:11:50,153 --> 00:11:51,687
Don't do that.

185
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,821
Save that stuff
for people you like.

186
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:57,420
Good morning
to you, too.

187
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,521
I know you want me to think
it was some giant coincidence

188
00:12:03,587 --> 00:12:05,020
you showed up
at the meeting last night,

189
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:06,454
but I don't believe
in coincidences.

190
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:10,220
No. You're wrong.

191
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:13,153
Look, I heard you were going
to be three years clean.

192
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,053
I'm two and a half.

193
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,487
Can't a friend root
for a friend?

194
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,320
Okay, fine.
I need a favor.

195
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:26,954
I already did you one.

196
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,787
Feel free to leave
anytime you want.

197
00:12:28,854 --> 00:12:30,888
Oh, you're cold.

198
00:12:30,954 --> 00:12:32,954
You got a heart
of ice.

199
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,721
You froze it, honey.

200
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,187
Well, get over it.

201
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:37,821
People get engaged
every day.

202
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:39,354
Sometimes it doesn't
work out.

203
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,020
You set me up.
You knew who I was.

204
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,687
You knew what I did
for a living.

205
00:12:42,754 --> 00:12:44,254
And you knew
who I was.

206
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,487
Nice girl from
a nice family.

207
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:50,621
Yeah, that's some family.

208
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,420
I would
have told you.

209
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:54,387
When? Before
or after the wedding?

210
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,254
Hmm?

211
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,420
Before or after
I was called

212
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,220
to testify against them?

213
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:07,621
What's the favor?

214
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:13,020
Those were our mules somebody
sliced and diced the other day.

215
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,120
Do you know anything?

216
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:19,621
You honestly think,
if I knew something,

217
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:21,220
I'd tell you?

218
00:13:22,921 --> 00:13:25,654
It would be good
for both of us, Lee.

219
00:13:27,087 --> 00:13:29,854
Get out of here.

220
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:33,320
Get your clothes,
and get out of here.

221
00:13:36,854 --> 00:13:39,020
No, no, sweetie.

222
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:41,687
No. Those are the cards
from Ariel's report.

223
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:45,020
It's okay. I told her
she could have them.

224
00:13:46,454 --> 00:13:48,287
Daddy!

225
00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:50,988
Is that for me? Thank you.

226
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:53,153
No. This one.
This one.

227
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,187
Oh, that one. Okay.

228
00:13:55,254 --> 00:13:56,988
I don't understand.

229
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:58,988
Last night, you said
the presentation went well.

230
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:01,053
It did. But it's not
like it was so good

231
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
that they're going to send me
to the State Assembly.

232
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:05,220
Mama!

233
00:14:05,287 --> 00:14:06,921
Thank you very much.

234
00:14:06,988 --> 00:14:09,454
Honey, if you do win,

235
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:12,153
you're going to have
to write these all over again.

236
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,754
I'm not going to win.

237
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:15,454
Terrence Bock is going to win.

238
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,354
His presentation was way
longer than anybody else's,

239
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,254
and he practically
had it memorized.

240
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,621
Well, I'm sure
he did a good job,

241
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:22,988
but we still don't know.

242
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:24,888
Oh, yes, I do.

243
00:14:24,954 --> 00:14:26,687
Terrence Bock is going to win.

244
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:30,521
You looking
for me?

245
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:31,554
Yeah. Lee, come on in.

246
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,187
What's up?

247
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:35,254
You making any progress

248
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,821
identifying those three mules
that died the other night?

249
00:14:37,888 --> 00:14:39,754
Surprise, surprise.
Their fingerprints and DNA

250
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:41,787
don't match anything
we had on file.

251
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:44,187
We reached out to the
appropriate foreign governments,

252
00:14:44,254 --> 00:14:46,787
and they contacted
their law
enforcement agencies,

253
00:14:46,854 --> 00:14:47,921
but it's going
to be a while

254
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,954
before anyone
gets back to us.

255
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,854
What?

256
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:53,420
I got the damnedest call

257
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:55,020
from a friend
in the coroner's office.

258
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:56,787
Their official report
won't be out

259
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,320
for another couple of hours,

260
00:14:58,387 --> 00:15:01,120
but one of these murdered girls

261
00:15:01,187 --> 00:15:03,254
doesn't quite fit the profile
of your typical drug mule.

262
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,754
How's that?

263
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,921
When was the last time
you ran into a dirt-poor girl

264
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:09,053
from Latin America
with a nose job?

265
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,087
Excuse me?

266
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:13,087
One of these mules appears
to have had cosmetic surgery.

267
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:14,988
A rhinoplasty.

268
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:16,621
And, in the coroner's
estimation,

269
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:18,420
quite an expensive one.

270
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:20,254
In addition, she's sporting
a very high-end set

271
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,754
of dental laminates.

272
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,187
Not the kind of thing
one would expect

273
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:25,888
from someone so impoverished
that they're willing

274
00:15:25,954 --> 00:15:28,621
to swallow capsules
of heroin for money.

275
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:36,387
I'm worried about you.

276
00:15:36,454 --> 00:15:38,621
Hello, stranger.

277
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,721
I had another
dream about you.

278
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:43,521
Maybe I'm the one who
should be worried about you.

279
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:45,354
It was kind of nutty.

280
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,754
You were with this
really exotic woman.

281
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,521
Nothing nutty about that.

282
00:15:49,587 --> 00:15:51,053
And she gouged
your eyes out

283
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,787
with her thumbs,
like those mules.

284
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,954
Come on. I'm waiting for you
to say something funny back.

285
00:16:00,053 --> 00:16:02,254
I don't quite
know what to say.

286
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,888
I'm at a loss for words.

287
00:16:03,954 --> 00:16:06,387
Truth is, I make all
my exotic women friends
wear boxing gloves.

288
00:16:06,454 --> 00:16:08,187
Ah, ha, ha!

289
00:16:08,254 --> 00:16:10,020
Hey, I appreciate
the tip.

290
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:13,087
Oh, hey, did Deputy Doll
ever get back to you?

291
00:16:13,153 --> 00:16:16,020
Wow. First,
you gouge out my eyes,

292
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:19,287
then you rip out my heart.

293
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,287
Overall,
I was very impressed

294
00:16:21,354 --> 00:16:23,087
with everyone's
presentations.

295
00:16:23,153 --> 00:16:25,988
Obviously, everyone can't go
to the State Assembly

296
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:28,521
but, ultimately, that's not
what this assignment was about.

297
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,287
Ultimately,

298
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:31,621
I hope it gave
all of you a chance

299
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:33,320
to learn about
how the citizens
of this country

300
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:36,654
compelled their government
to create laws that would

301
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:39,721
protect and guarantee
equality and fairness

302
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:41,320
for everyone,

303
00:16:41,387 --> 00:16:42,487
no matter
who they are,

304
00:16:42,554 --> 00:16:43,654
no matter what
they look like,

305
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:44,387
no matter
how much money

306
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:46,587
they make.

307
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:51,387
This is great.

308
00:16:51,454 --> 00:16:53,020
We're really proud
of you, kiddo.

309
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:54,220
I don't know.

310
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:57,220
What is there not to know, huh?

311
00:16:57,287 --> 00:16:58,754
You obviously did a great job.

312
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:00,187
But I didn't.

313
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:01,821
I mean, you saw.

314
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,654
I did it the night before
and the morning of.

315
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:06,621
Well, sometimes...

316
00:17:06,687 --> 00:17:08,420
I can't believe I'm saying this.

317
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:09,921
Sometimes it isn't about that.

318
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,420
I could use a little help
over here.

319
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:13,687
I think what your mother's
trying to say

320
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:16,387
is that preparation
always counts.

321
00:17:16,454 --> 00:17:18,988
But, a lot of times,
in the real world,

322
00:17:19,053 --> 00:17:20,854
it ends up being about
the final product.

323
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:22,554
And I guess
we have to assume

324
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:23,621
that your final product--

325
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:24,988
your presentation--
was the best.

326
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:26,420
But it wasn't.

327
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:27,888
Terrence's was.

328
00:17:27,954 --> 00:17:29,921
Well, that's your
opinion, honey.

329
00:17:29,988 --> 00:17:33,120
But, apparently,
Mr. Cathcart doesn't agree.

330
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:35,220
Wait a second.
Who is this "Terrence"?

331
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,721
Is he some boy you like?

332
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:39,020
Dad!

333
00:17:39,087 --> 00:17:40,621
I'm just asking.

334
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:43,587
No. No one likes him.

335
00:17:43,654 --> 00:17:45,220
He's not the kind of boy
girls like.

336
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:46,654
He's kind of icky.

337
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:49,587
But his presentation

338
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:50,854
was so good.

339
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:52,420
He's like somebody
you'd see on one of those

340
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:56,287
boring cable shows or something,
talking about history.

341
00:17:56,354 --> 00:17:59,988
I just keep thinking that
Mr. Cathcart made a mistake.

342
00:18:01,654 --> 00:18:03,287
Well, then, you need
to talk to him about it.

343
00:18:03,354 --> 00:18:05,454
Either he will convince you
that you did a great job

344
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:07,821
or you'll convince him
otherwise.

345
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,621
Hey. Thanks for coming.

346
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:33,354
It's cold out, Lee,
and it's late.

347
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,087
You kicked me out
of your bed
this morning,

348
00:18:35,153 --> 00:18:38,087
and then you call me
and tell me to come over.

349
00:18:38,153 --> 00:18:39,420
What's going on?

350
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,754
Nothing's going on.

351
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:42,621
You asked me
if I could find out

352
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:44,120
who might have
done this thing.

353
00:18:44,187 --> 00:18:45,354
You know?

354
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,420
I'm working on it.

355
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:50,354
I got to ask you
a question though.

356
00:18:53,087 --> 00:18:54,654
Do you know these girls?

357
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:56,454
You know their names?

358
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:58,020
Their names?
They're mules.

359
00:18:58,087 --> 00:18:59,420
I don't know
their names.

360
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:00,787
They're recruited
over there.

361
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:01,988
I mean, whoever did this,
they took their passports.

362
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:03,587
They took their ticket stubs.

363
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:05,387
We went through that hotel
with a fine-tooth comb,

364
00:19:05,454 --> 00:19:06,854
and we couldn't find a thing.

365
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:08,087
Wait a second.

366
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:09,687
Do you know something,

367
00:19:09,754 --> 00:19:11,687
or are you trying
to find something out?

368
00:19:11,754 --> 00:19:14,153
I know this: I know it's
too early to be waging a war

369
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,387
against whoever you think
it is might be responsible.

370
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:19,120
You're confusing me.
What are you saying?

371
00:19:19,187 --> 00:19:21,754
I'm saying something's
starting to smell funny.

372
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:23,454
Something caught
the coroner's eye this morning.

373
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:25,020
I didn't think much
of it at first.

374
00:19:25,087 --> 00:19:26,521
Maybe it's something.
Maybe it's nothing.

375
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:28,988
What are you
talking about?

376
00:19:29,053 --> 00:19:30,487
I'm not entirely sure.

377
00:19:30,554 --> 00:19:32,888
All I know is
something isn't adding up,

378
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:34,921
and I'd hate to see a lot
of innocent people die

379
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:38,721
and a lot of blood
get spilled for no reason.

380
00:19:38,787 --> 00:19:40,420
Talk to who you
need to talk to.
Buy me some time.

381
00:19:40,487 --> 00:19:41,821
Let me get
to the bottom of this.

382
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,721
What?

383
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,687
You know, we could
have had this
conversation in bed.

384
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:55,487
Someone I work with told me to
be careful with women like you

385
00:19:55,554 --> 00:19:57,521
or I might just end up
like one of your mules.

386
00:19:57,587 --> 00:20:00,087
They should mind
their own business.

387
00:20:00,153 --> 00:20:02,687
I'll talk to whoever
I need to talk to.

388
00:20:02,754 --> 00:20:05,587
I'll try to
calm things down.

389
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:07,220
I appreciate it.

390
00:20:11,754 --> 00:20:13,454
Last chance.

391
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,187
Don't tempt me.

392
00:20:33,404 --> 00:20:35,338
Mr. Cathcart?

393
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:36,837
Ariel. Come on in.

394
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,237
What can I
help you with?

395
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,670
It's about the presentation,
the trip.

396
00:20:40,737 --> 00:20:43,137
Oh, you know what?

397
00:20:43,204 --> 00:20:44,870
I don't actually
have the packet yet.

398
00:20:44,937 --> 00:20:47,104
Uh, the permission slips and the
information for your parents--

399
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:48,971
I'm still waiting for it
to come from the central office.

400
00:20:49,037 --> 00:20:51,770
Uh, no. That-That's not it.

401
00:20:51,837 --> 00:20:54,737
Um, I was really surprised
that you picked me.

402
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,037
Come sit down.

403
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:02,704
Why are you surprised
that I would pick you?

404
00:21:04,537 --> 00:21:06,570
Well, I guess I just didn't
think I was the best.

405
00:21:06,637 --> 00:21:08,870
What, you think someone
else's was better?

406
00:21:08,937 --> 00:21:10,404
Whose?

407
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,570
Terrence Bock's.

408
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:19,171
Terrence Bock?

409
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:20,737
You're kidding.

410
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:23,004
That boy disgusts me.

411
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:25,271
Terrence Bock
is a very bright boy.

412
00:21:25,338 --> 00:21:28,570
Uh, his research
was very detailed.

413
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:30,804
I just look at him,
and I get depressed.

414
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,937
You know he's going
to spend his life alone.

415
00:21:33,004 --> 00:21:37,870
But a presentation is more than
just the collection of data.

416
00:21:37,937 --> 00:21:39,804
You know, its effectiveness
often hinges

417
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,603
on a lot of intangibles.

418
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,837
But does he ever wash?

419
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:44,204
Have you ever seen him

420
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:46,037
when there wasn't something
in his nose?

421
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:49,004
Likability,
the attractiveness of the person

422
00:21:49,071 --> 00:21:51,037
making the presentation.

423
00:21:51,104 --> 00:21:53,603
Your willingness
to listen to what
they have to say.

424
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,137
He's repugnant.

425
00:21:55,204 --> 00:21:58,737
Even the word "repugnant"
finds him repugnant.

426
00:21:58,804 --> 00:22:03,438
In all those areas, Ariel,
your work was vastly superior.

427
00:22:05,637 --> 00:22:07,937
Uh, okay.

428
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:09,470
I hope I answered
your question.

429
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,971
And I hope you're
genuinely as excited
about this as I am.

430
00:22:12,037 --> 00:22:13,737
I think we're going
to have a wonderful day
at the Capitol.

431
00:22:13,804 --> 00:22:16,338
Uh, sure, Mr. Cathcart.

432
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,104
Hey, you got a minute?

433
00:22:22,603 --> 00:22:24,304
What's that expression?

434
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:25,438
Fool me once, good for you.

435
00:22:25,503 --> 00:22:26,937
Fool me twice...

436
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:29,204
Hey, what's on your mind?

437
00:22:31,637 --> 00:22:32,937
I don't understand.

438
00:22:33,004 --> 00:22:34,137
You should be
a happy guy.

439
00:22:34,204 --> 00:22:35,438
Two days ago
we all thought

440
00:22:35,503 --> 00:22:37,171
we were staring
at a drug war.

441
00:22:37,237 --> 00:22:38,470
48 hours
have gone by

442
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:39,770
and nothing's happened.

443
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:41,603
I know. That's kind
of interesting, isn't it?

444
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,737
Well, I'm just assuming.

445
00:22:42,804 --> 00:22:44,304
I mean, you told me
yesterday

446
00:22:44,371 --> 00:22:45,570
you were going
to talk to some people,

447
00:22:45,637 --> 00:22:46,670
try and cool things off.

448
00:22:46,737 --> 00:22:48,137
You're right:
it was me.

449
00:22:48,204 --> 00:22:50,037
I'm a hero.
I made peace
in the Middle East.

450
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:51,971
I should run
for President.

451
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,237
You know what?

452
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:55,137
I have dinner
waiting for me at home,

453
00:22:55,204 --> 00:22:56,537
so if you're not going
to tell me what's
on your mind...

454
00:22:56,603 --> 00:22:58,937
I spent most of the afternoon
with the coroner.

455
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,137
That third mule.

456
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:02,338
It's not just
a nose job,

457
00:23:02,404 --> 00:23:03,971
not just nice teeth.

458
00:23:04,037 --> 00:23:05,104
She had piercings
in places

459
00:23:05,171 --> 00:23:06,637
I didn't know
you could pierce.

460
00:23:06,704 --> 00:23:09,904
Not something you see
a lot of in Latin America.

461
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:13,371
Didn't I have
this very conversation
with you yesterday?

462
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:15,603
<i>( sighing ):
So what are you thinking?</i>

463
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,037
An American girl
in a foreign country

464
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,137
down on her luck
agrees to swallow drugs

465
00:23:19,204 --> 00:23:20,737
for the money to get back home?

466
00:23:20,804 --> 00:23:23,371
Maybe.
Maybe she never left home.

467
00:23:23,438 --> 00:23:24,371
Excuse me?

468
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:25,670
Pubic hair's blonde.

469
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,071
Didn't have any
when they brought her in.

470
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:31,304
You know how nails
and hair keep growing
for a couple days after.

471
00:23:31,371 --> 00:23:34,304
I got a hunch
her eyes were blue,

472
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,037
but I guess
we'll never know that.

473
00:23:36,104 --> 00:23:38,503
Tell me where you're going
with this.

474
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,570
Somebody dies
by accident, on purpose...

475
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:42,704
I don't know.

476
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,937
They need
to get rid of a body.

477
00:23:45,004 --> 00:23:46,171
As luck would have it,
their family happens

478
00:23:46,237 --> 00:23:47,670
to be in the
drug-running business.

479
00:23:47,737 --> 00:23:50,104
So you slaughter two
of your own mules,

480
00:23:50,171 --> 00:23:51,870
girls that no one
will ever miss,

481
00:23:51,937 --> 00:23:53,737
you throw in a third;
everybody assumes

482
00:23:53,804 --> 00:23:55,171
that they come
from the same place,

483
00:23:55,237 --> 00:23:56,937
do the same thing.

484
00:23:57,004 --> 00:23:59,503
And while everybody's looking
for a girl from Latin America,

485
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,570
Jane Doe from somewhere
in the US lies unclaimed

486
00:24:01,637 --> 00:24:02,670
in the coroner's office.

487
00:24:02,737 --> 00:24:04,937
Something like that.

488
00:24:05,004 --> 00:24:06,570
<i>Mom?</i>

489
00:24:06,637 --> 00:24:10,570
Can you come talk to me?

490
00:24:10,637 --> 00:24:13,171
That Mr. Cathcart,

491
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:16,971
the one who said those horrible
things about Terrence--

492
00:24:17,037 --> 00:24:21,470
I'm pretty sure he wasn't
even in the room today.

493
00:24:21,537 --> 00:24:24,804
You know what I'm talking
about, don't you?

494
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:28,371
I don't know.
Maybe. Kinda.

495
00:24:28,438 --> 00:24:32,570
I think it might have been
his heart that you heard.

496
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,971
I think it might
have been his soul.

497
00:24:35,037 --> 00:24:39,338
Okay, but what
do I do now?

498
00:24:39,404 --> 00:24:41,470
I don't know.

499
00:24:41,537 --> 00:24:43,071
What do you want
to do?

500
00:24:43,137 --> 00:24:44,971
Shouldn't we tell someone?

501
00:24:45,037 --> 00:24:47,104
Tell them what?

502
00:24:47,171 --> 00:24:48,804
That deep down inside

503
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:52,470
Mr. Cathcart doesn't like
Terrence?

504
00:24:52,537 --> 00:24:55,770
How would we prove that?

505
00:24:55,837 --> 00:24:57,338
What would we say?

506
00:24:57,404 --> 00:25:00,304
So we just do nothing?

507
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:01,371
I didn't say that.

508
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,470
Does Terence know how much
you liked his presentation?

509
00:25:07,537 --> 00:25:09,937
No.

510
00:25:10,004 --> 00:25:13,271
I don't talk to Terrence.

511
00:25:13,338 --> 00:25:16,137
Nobody I know talks to Terrence.

512
00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:25,237
What?

513
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:29,637
I was listening to your heart.

514
00:25:29,704 --> 00:25:31,904
I was listening to your soul.

515
00:25:33,404 --> 00:25:35,171
<i>( doorbell ringing )</i>

516
00:25:40,404 --> 00:25:41,937
Hey, Lee.

517
00:25:42,004 --> 00:25:44,737
I know it's the middle
of the night, but...

518
00:25:44,804 --> 00:25:46,271
What's this?

519
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:47,904
Search warrant.

520
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:50,304
You're kidding, right?

521
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:51,804
Searching for what?

522
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,770
Why don't you just
let us in, Lee?

523
00:25:59,937 --> 00:26:02,637
Appreciate it.

524
00:26:02,704 --> 00:26:04,670
They'll just take
a quick look around,

525
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:06,071
then we'll be on our way.

526
00:26:06,137 --> 00:26:08,470
Mr. District Attorney?

527
00:26:08,537 --> 00:26:09,637
Excuse me.

528
00:26:09,704 --> 00:26:12,837
Found these
on the night table, sir.

529
00:26:26,357 --> 00:26:27,524
Morning.

530
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:28,923
Hey, early bird.
What's up?

531
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,057
I'm concerned about
Detective Scanlon.

532
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:33,758
The last three nights
I've had dreams about him.

533
00:26:33,823 --> 00:26:36,124
Dreams, huh?

534
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,291
Well, let me be the first
to let you down easy.

535
00:26:39,357 --> 00:26:42,524
Office gossip is he's got a yen
for our new deputy mayor.

536
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:43,658
I'm serious.

537
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,724
Come on, man.

538
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,391
Time to flush and go.

539
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:53,790
Your future ex is waiting.

540
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,424
DEVALOS:
Lieutenant Greene.

541
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:01,758
Mr. District Attorney,
may I speak to you for a moment?

542
00:27:01,823 --> 00:27:02,758
In private,

543
00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:04,457
if that's possible.

544
00:27:27,624 --> 00:27:29,923
Sorry to interrupt.

545
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,324
No problem.

546
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,424
Is everything all right?

547
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:43,724
That, that was
Lieutenant Greene.

548
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,190
He runs Vice.

549
00:27:45,257 --> 00:27:48,391
He came to tell me they finally
ID'd that third mule.

550
00:27:48,457 --> 00:27:50,357
Turns out she wasn't
a mule at all.

551
00:27:50,424 --> 00:27:52,691
She was a police officer--

552
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:55,658
an undercover police officer.

553
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:57,257
Jennifer Reed.

554
00:27:57,324 --> 00:28:00,391
Nice girl.

555
00:28:00,457 --> 00:28:02,357
Third-generation
Phoenix PD.

556
00:28:02,424 --> 00:28:04,923
I don't understand.

557
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,291
Someone dyed her hair black,
pulled out her eyes,

558
00:28:07,357 --> 00:28:11,491
threw her in a trash can
with two other mules, and...

559
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,057
they figured
that we'd be so busy

560
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:17,324
looking for someone
Colombian or Honduran or...

561
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:20,890
We didn't even know
she was missing.

562
00:28:22,923 --> 00:28:24,391
I'm sorry.

563
00:28:24,457 --> 00:28:25,990
What were we talking about?
Dreams...

564
00:28:26,057 --> 00:28:30,057
I'm going to come back
another time.

565
00:28:56,957 --> 00:28:59,457
Did you know
her well?

566
00:28:59,524 --> 00:29:02,324
Not really.

567
00:29:02,391 --> 00:29:05,224
She worked for Larry
in Vice.

568
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:08,224
Larry and I
came up together,

569
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:11,823
undercover work.

570
00:29:13,624 --> 00:29:15,823
No, I didn't know her.

571
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,557
I knew the person
who did this to her, though.

572
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:22,391
Four years ago or so,
I was deep undercover

573
00:29:22,457 --> 00:29:25,424
investigating the Cabrerra
family drug operation.

574
00:29:25,491 --> 00:29:28,890
I was spending
a lot of time in clubs.

575
00:29:28,957 --> 00:29:30,057
Spending a lot of time

576
00:29:30,124 --> 00:29:32,090
with a lot of
really twisted people,

577
00:29:32,157 --> 00:29:34,424
dabbling in the drugs myself,
which was really stupid,

578
00:29:34,491 --> 00:29:37,790
but kind of the only way
to live in that world.

579
00:29:37,857 --> 00:29:40,190
She was this club girl.

580
00:29:40,257 --> 00:29:42,324
Everywhere I was, she was.

581
00:29:42,391 --> 00:29:44,923
She was so much fun.

582
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,790
And I'm this
pathological bachelor,

583
00:29:46,857 --> 00:29:49,457
but all of a sudden,
I can't bear the thought

584
00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:51,424
of living my life
without this girl.

585
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:54,790
I can't bear the thought
of her being with anybody else.

586
00:29:56,658 --> 00:29:58,923
I fell hard, Allison.

587
00:30:03,324 --> 00:30:04,923
Then one day,
our favorite district attorney

588
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,790
Manuel Devalos calls me
into his office.

589
00:30:07,857 --> 00:30:11,691
He says, "You engaged
to this woman?"

590
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:16,691
And it's her.

591
00:30:16,758 --> 00:30:19,057
She's a Cabrerra.

592
00:30:19,124 --> 00:30:20,890
It's all a setup.

593
00:30:20,957 --> 00:30:24,057
I can't testify against them
without an attorney saying,

594
00:30:24,124 --> 00:30:27,857
"Hey, wait a second.
You're not an unbiased witness."

595
00:30:27,923 --> 00:30:30,124
So they drummed me out of Vice,

596
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,724
put me through rehab,
moved me over to Homicide.

597
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,224
I never saw her again.

598
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,391
Not until the other day
when she showed up

599
00:30:36,457 --> 00:30:38,324
at that NA meeting.

600
00:30:40,391 --> 00:30:42,457
So...

601
00:30:42,524 --> 00:30:47,391
that's the wedding,
the drugs.

602
00:30:47,457 --> 00:30:49,090
What else did you dream?

603
00:30:49,157 --> 00:30:51,857
She blinds you.

604
00:30:51,923 --> 00:30:54,357
I guess we both know
what that's about.

605
00:30:56,391 --> 00:30:58,691
Larry said
this girl Jennifer

606
00:30:58,758 --> 00:31:03,624
was deep undercover
in Elena's organization.

607
00:31:03,691 --> 00:31:06,157
We're guessing Elena killed her,
then sought me out

608
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:07,823
to be sure we bought
the mule thing.

609
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,124
And we would have if it wasn't
for the plastic surgery.

610
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,291
What happens now?

611
00:31:12,357 --> 00:31:14,324
We have a warrant out
for her arrest,

612
00:31:14,391 --> 00:31:16,057
but I'm guessing she's gone.

613
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,457
What was that other dream?

614
00:31:18,524 --> 00:31:20,890
Devalos searches
your place.

615
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:22,491
Right.

616
00:31:22,557 --> 00:31:25,491
Can't help you with that one.

617
00:31:35,257 --> 00:31:36,658
Hi, Mom.

618
00:31:36,724 --> 00:31:37,724
I'm hungry.

619
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,424
Can we stop somewhere for food?

620
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:40,890
We have food
at home, Bridge.

621
00:31:40,957 --> 00:31:42,923
We got apples,
oranges, bananas.

622
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,524
That's not food.
It's fruit.

623
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,457
Hi, Mom. Can I bring a friend
home from school?

624
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:49,957
Now? Today?

625
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:51,557
Oh, Ariel, who is it?

626
00:31:51,624 --> 00:31:53,391
Terrence Bock.

627
00:31:53,457 --> 00:31:56,624
Terrence Bock?

628
00:31:56,691 --> 00:31:58,024
Sure, I guess so.

629
00:31:59,357 --> 00:32:02,391
ARIEL:
Hey, Terrence, she
said it's all right!

630
00:32:11,124 --> 00:32:12,724
Hi, Terrence.
Nice to meet you.

631
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,524
Hi.

632
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:17,424
Are you hot with that coat on?

633
00:32:17,491 --> 00:32:19,224
No.

634
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:21,257
This is my sister Bridgette.

635
00:32:21,324 --> 00:32:22,090
Hi.

636
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,024
<i>( whispering ):
Tell her you want
to stop for food.</i>

637
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,957
Thanks for being
so nice to him.

638
00:32:29,024 --> 00:32:31,957
Letting him stay
for dinner and everything.

639
00:32:32,024 --> 00:32:34,823
Oh, I was happy to.

640
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,923
He seemed really...

641
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,057
What is the deal
with that coat?

642
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,823
I don't know.

643
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,457
He's kind of odd.

644
00:32:43,524 --> 00:32:45,923
I'm not even sure we're
going to stay friends.

645
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:49,557
Although, he did seem
to hit it off with Bridgette.

646
00:32:49,624 --> 00:32:51,724
But you
were right.

647
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:55,591
I'm glad I told him how much
I liked his presentation.

648
00:32:55,658 --> 00:32:58,758
You can tell
he's probably not somebody

649
00:32:58,823 --> 00:33:01,257
who hears good stuff
very much.

650
00:33:01,324 --> 00:33:05,424
I think you probably made him
very happy.

651
00:33:05,491 --> 00:33:08,424
I talked to Mr. Cathcart, too.

652
00:33:08,491 --> 00:33:10,724
Oh, yeah?

653
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,790
I told him I wouldn't be going
to the State Assembly.

654
00:33:13,857 --> 00:33:15,557
I hope that's okay.

655
00:33:15,624 --> 00:33:19,857
I think that's very okay.

656
00:33:19,923 --> 00:33:22,257
How did he react?

657
00:33:22,324 --> 00:33:25,890
He got really quiet.

658
00:33:25,957 --> 00:33:28,291
Both of him.

659
00:33:28,357 --> 00:33:31,157
We have really special kids.

660
00:33:31,224 --> 00:33:32,923
I had nothing to do with it.

661
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,890
I wasn't even in town that week.

662
00:33:35,957 --> 00:33:39,124
Did you ask what gives
with that boy and his coat?

663
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,057
Apparently, that's
where he derives

664
00:33:41,124 --> 00:33:43,324
his extraordinary powers
of elocution from.

665
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:46,823
<i>( sighs )</i>

666
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,658
Today started off
as the most dark, awful day.

667
00:33:52,124 --> 00:33:54,391
What happened
to change it?

668
00:33:54,457 --> 00:33:57,157
Nothing changed.

669
00:33:57,224 --> 00:34:00,890
The woman responsible
for all this death and sadness

670
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:02,691
is still at large.

671
00:34:02,758 --> 00:34:06,057
Detective Scanlon
is out there somewhere

672
00:34:06,124 --> 00:34:07,691
wrestling with his demons,

673
00:34:07,758 --> 00:34:09,157
trying to make sense
of the choices

674
00:34:09,224 --> 00:34:11,624
he's made with his life.

675
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:14,990
A young undercover cop
and two unsuspecting mules

676
00:34:15,057 --> 00:34:17,823
are still dead.

677
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:21,324
Nothing changed.

678
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:24,291
It's just...

679
00:34:24,357 --> 00:34:27,724
I have kids.

680
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:31,758
No matter how dark
things get at work

681
00:34:31,823 --> 00:34:34,658
I can come home.

682
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:37,724
And there's always
something light.

683
00:34:41,324 --> 00:34:43,591
All right, maybe I was
home those weeks.

684
00:34:55,057 --> 00:34:56,190
Forget the light.

685
00:34:56,257 --> 00:34:57,691
Close the door.

686
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:03,790
Elena...
you already killed one cop.

687
00:35:03,857 --> 00:35:06,257
You shoot me, they won't
even bother with a trial.

688
00:35:06,324 --> 00:35:07,291
They'll just claim

689
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:08,857
you tried to escape
one night

690
00:35:08,923 --> 00:35:10,691
and let one of the guards
take you out for fun.

691
00:35:10,758 --> 00:35:12,491
I didn't kill any cops.

692
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:13,923
I didn't kill any mules.

693
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,524
I didn't do this.

694
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:17,923
It wasn't done by me.
It was done to me.

695
00:35:19,957 --> 00:35:21,157
Don't answer it.

696
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,024
Elena...

697
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:32,524
Yeah?

698
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:33,724
DEVALOS:
Lee.

699
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,424
It's Manny Devalos.

700
00:35:37,957 --> 00:35:39,491
Lee.

701
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:53,857
Hey, what's
going on?

702
00:35:53,923 --> 00:35:55,758
Is everything okay?

703
00:35:55,823 --> 00:35:58,624
I don't know.
I think I have
to call Devalos.

704
00:35:58,691 --> 00:36:00,890
What?

705
00:36:00,957 --> 00:36:02,357
What are you
talking about?

706
00:36:02,424 --> 00:36:04,124
It's 3:00 in
the morning, Al.

707
00:36:06,923 --> 00:36:07,923
Almost out the door.

708
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,057
Excuse me?

709
00:36:09,124 --> 00:36:10,324
I'm sorry. Who is this?

710
00:36:10,391 --> 00:36:12,758
It's Allison Dubois.
It's Allison.

711
00:36:12,823 --> 00:36:15,124
I'm sorry to call you
in the middle of the night.

712
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,124
It's just...

713
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,790
Allison, I can't talk now.

714
00:36:17,857 --> 00:36:19,957
Look, someone spotted a woman
who matches the description

715
00:36:20,024 --> 00:36:22,157
of Elena Cabrerra breaking
and entering an apartment

716
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:24,257
in the building where
Detective Scanlon lives.

717
00:36:24,324 --> 00:36:25,758
We've been calling and calling,

718
00:36:25,823 --> 00:36:27,624
but we can't get him
on the phone.

719
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:29,357
It's probably
a wild-goose chase,

720
00:36:29,424 --> 00:36:31,424
but I'm headed over there now
with Lieutenant Greene.

721
00:36:31,491 --> 00:36:33,357
Can I talk to you
tomorrow please?

722
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,190
Of course, but...

723
00:36:35,257 --> 00:36:37,491
It's not
a wild-goose chase, sir.

724
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
???

725
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:46,120
Forget the light.

726
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:48,388
Close the door.

727
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:54,520
Elena...
you already killed one cop.

728
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,987
You shoot me, they won't
even bother with a trial.

729
00:36:57,054 --> 00:36:57,987
They'll just claim

730
00:36:58,054 --> 00:36:59,553
you tried to escape
one night

731
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,354
and let one of the guards
take you out for fun.

732
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:03,187
I didn't kill any cops.

733
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:04,620
I didn't kill any mules.

734
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:06,187
I didn't do this.

735
00:37:06,254 --> 00:37:08,454
It wasn't done by me.
It was done to me.

736
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,653
Elena...

737
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,321
I need your help.

738
00:37:13,388 --> 00:37:14,854
I need your protection.

739
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,887
What are you talking about?

740
00:37:15,954 --> 00:37:17,854
Of all the women
in the world,

741
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,520
you're the one I know
needs the least protection.

742
00:37:20,587 --> 00:37:21,854
Now put the gun down.

743
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,154
You're such an
adorable fool, Lee.

744
00:37:25,221 --> 00:37:27,421
Everybody needs protection.

745
00:37:27,488 --> 00:37:29,021
Especially drug dealers.

746
00:37:29,087 --> 00:37:31,321
Don't you know that's what
you were supposed to be?

747
00:37:31,388 --> 00:37:33,820
When I first met you
at the clubs,

748
00:37:33,887 --> 00:37:35,620
when I first made you
for a cop,

749
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:38,620
I said to my uncles,
"That one. He's cute.

750
00:37:38,687 --> 00:37:41,121
He's on his way up.
Let me at him."

751
00:37:41,187 --> 00:37:43,653
And you were good
at everything.

752
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,720
Except the compromising-
your-convictions part.

753
00:37:46,787 --> 00:37:48,321
No way were
you going to take

754
00:37:48,388 --> 00:37:49,488
a piece of our operation

755
00:37:49,553 --> 00:37:50,754
in return for
a little protection.

756
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,820
It just wasn't
in you.

757
00:37:51,887 --> 00:37:53,354
Sorry to let you down.

758
00:37:53,421 --> 00:37:56,454
I had a need and
you couldn't fill it.

759
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,054
But your friend,
Larry Greene...

760
00:37:58,121 --> 00:37:59,187
What'd you call him?

761
00:37:59,254 --> 00:38:01,287
"The best man I know?"

762
00:38:01,354 --> 00:38:02,754
Very practical fellow.

763
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,587
Happy to hear that.

764
00:38:05,653 --> 00:38:08,321
Now here you want my help.

765
00:38:08,388 --> 00:38:09,954
Then put the gun down...

766
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,920
and let me take you in.

767
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,354
Anything you
want to say,

768
00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:18,887
I know the DA
would love to hear it.

769
00:38:18,954 --> 00:38:20,021
Lee...

770
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:21,854
I'm trying to tell you
what's going on.

771
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,287
I'm trying to tell you
what happened.

772
00:38:24,354 --> 00:38:26,187
That girl? That cop?

773
00:38:26,254 --> 00:38:29,421
She was deep undercover,
and she figured it out.

774
00:38:29,488 --> 00:38:31,154
She figured out
Lieutenant Greene
was dirty,

775
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:32,321
so he killed her.

776
00:38:32,388 --> 00:38:33,520
Made her look like a mule,

777
00:38:33,587 --> 00:38:35,121
and figured I'd start
a war over it,

778
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,454
and by the time
the smoke cleared,

779
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,920
nobody'd be the wiser.

780
00:38:37,987 --> 00:38:41,388
Now, that's quite
a story, Elena.

781
00:38:41,454 --> 00:38:42,754
But you have to admit

782
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,054
you been telling stories
since the day I met you.

783
00:38:47,121 --> 00:38:51,021
"I'm just a businesswoman
who loves to dance, Lee."

784
00:38:51,087 --> 00:38:55,021
"I've been waiting for you
my whole life, Lee."

785
00:38:55,087 --> 00:38:57,321
"I'd love
to marry you, Lee."

786
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,187
Now put the gun down,
let me take you to city hall

787
00:39:02,254 --> 00:39:03,454
where you can tell your story

788
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,620
to somebody who actually
gives a damn.

789
00:39:11,854 --> 00:39:13,321
Thank you.

790
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:17,388
Turn around.

791
00:39:27,254 --> 00:39:28,520
<i>( knocking )</i>

792
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:31,388
Yeah?

793
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:33,454
Hey, Lee,
it's Greene.

794
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,687
Word on
the street is

795
00:39:34,754 --> 00:39:35,520
you might have
some company.

796
00:39:35,587 --> 00:39:36,754
Got it under control.

797
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,887
We're heading downtown,
you want to meet us.

798
00:39:38,954 --> 00:39:40,520
Whatever you say,
amigo.

799
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,254
Just want to warn
you, though...

800
00:39:42,321 --> 00:39:44,121
the whole damn cavalry
is on the way.

801
00:39:44,187 --> 00:39:47,154
Do me a favor and tell them
to meet me back at the fort.

802
00:39:47,221 --> 00:39:49,287
You got it.

803
00:39:52,887 --> 00:39:53,887
Lee...

804
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,354
You have the right
to remain silent.

805
00:39:58,421 --> 00:40:00,954
Anything you say
can and will be

806
00:40:01,021 --> 00:40:03,054
used against you
in a court of law.

807
00:40:03,121 --> 00:40:05,054
You have the right to counsel.

808
00:40:09,587 --> 00:40:11,154
Skank-whore death merchant.

809
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:12,820
Kills a cop.
Breaks and enters.

810
00:40:12,887 --> 00:40:13,887
Over and out.

811
00:40:27,987 --> 00:40:28,987
Lee!

812
00:40:29,488 --> 00:40:30,388
Lee!

813
00:40:30,454 --> 00:40:32,454
Lee!

814
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,121
Yeah...

815
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:59,653
"That one," I said.

816
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:04,154
"He's cute.

817
00:41:04,221 --> 00:41:05,920
Let me at him."

818
00:41:39,254 --> 00:41:39,354
How you doing?

819
00:41:40,321 --> 00:41:42,720
I was concerned
about you.

820
00:41:44,021 --> 00:41:45,820
Why, did you have
any more dreams?

821
00:41:45,887 --> 00:41:51,054
Well, yeah, actually,
I had one.

822
00:41:51,121 --> 00:41:54,121
A woman came to me.

823
00:41:54,187 --> 00:41:56,954
She was on her way to
a very dark, awful place,

824
00:41:57,021 --> 00:41:59,454
and she knew it.

825
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,488
Before she got there,

826
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:04,854
she wanted me
to say "hi" to you.

827
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,488
To tell you
she was sorry.

828
00:42:07,553 --> 00:42:09,720
To tell you
"thank you."

829
00:42:21,254 --> 00:42:24,553
What, no
"Deputy Doll"?

830
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,587
I don't know.

831
00:42:26,653 --> 00:42:29,021
I got the sense
it wasn't appreciated.

832
00:42:30,054 --> 00:42:31,388
Really?

833
00:42:31,454 --> 00:42:32,920
Not much of a mind reader,
are you?
