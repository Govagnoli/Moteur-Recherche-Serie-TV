Distributor cap?

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,180
I wouldn't know a distributor
cap from a baseball cap.

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,090
Mom,a freaking mechanic!

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,600
It'sand my piece-of-crap
car won't start,

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,280
and all I want to know is
can I please use ur Tmber?

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,470
Without the lecture.

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,420
You know what,Mother? Never mind.

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,090
Someone's here. Someone more
useful than you right now.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,280

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,010
Thank you for stopping.

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,950
You work at the yogurt place?

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,010
Car trouble?

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,960
Yeah. All I know is it won't start.

14
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,360
I don't know if it needs
a jump or a tow or...

15
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,280
Or a screw.

16
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,990
Excuse me?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,180
Maybe you just need a screw tightened.

18
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,090
Sometimes,the rain,you
know,it loosens things.

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,710
Let me take a look at it.

20
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,110
Let cables.

00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:36,400
Look,uh... why don't you get in
and see if it can get started?

29
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,460
You rule,man!

30
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,130
You totally saved me.

31
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,570
My mom. Pain in the ass.Thank you so...

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,040

I thought you day with me ********

35
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,790
I had a real nightmare
about Cynthia Keener hare.

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,930
What could possibly give
that woman nightmares?

37
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,070
Other than somebody named
Dorothy dropping a house on her.

I need you to wolf this down double-time.

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,100
That means you,too.

43
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,040
And if I choke because
I'm eating too fast?

44
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,660

00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,940
I don't know. Mom's

48
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,930
But it's addressed to you,Dad.

it's orts like it says on the cover.

50
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,620
What sport is she doing?

51
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,580
Look,I don't publish the magazine.

52
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,130
I didn't edit the magazine.

53
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,610
You know,your mom gets lots
of magazines,too,you know?

54
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,810
Yeah,but Mom's magazines ********

55

{\a6}YOUNG WOMAN ABDUCTED
FROM MALL PARKING LOT

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,210
Cynthia Keener had a daughter named
Suzie who went missing in 1998.

60
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,550
*****with her cell phone,her
wallet,her credit cards still inside.

61
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,990
"to the victim found inside the vehicle
"led Phoenix police to conclude that MneHer

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,010
was forcibly abducted from the scene."

63
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,910
God.

64
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,270
You're taking this pretty hard.

65
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,370
I work with this woman practically
every da dn't even know she was a mother,

66
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,010
let alone a victim
of a horrible tragedy.

67
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,820
I can't believe she anything.

68
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,140
that you bring up in
casual conversation.

69
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,240
My conversations with her aren't casual.

70
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,970
I help her find missing people.

71
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,520
Her daughter is a missing person.

72
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,400
You'd think that would com I'm
supposed tet wh hein less than an h

73
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,010
What the hell do I say to her?

74
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,170
Why... why are you
going to say anything?

75
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,200
I methis is clearly something
that't want to talk about.

76
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,810
I dreamt it for a reason,for a purpose.

77
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,560
is to open up Cynthia Keener's
year and pour salt in it.

78
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,740
Of course not. But.

79
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,960
I don't think there's a "but" here.

80
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,970
It seems to me that everything you saw
is right there in that news article.

81
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,500
Did you see the kidnapper's face or his.

82
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,400
- No.
- I don't know.

83
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,720
Maybe the universe just wants you to
know at tWitch isn't so wicked after all.

84
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,970
Melanie Louise Linder,age 18.

85
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,500
Lives with her parents
Marjorie and Clarence Linder.

86
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,630
Hasn't called home in 72 hours.

87
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,470
Did you get to the
she's done this before?

88
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,910
Yeah. Ran off to Baja with her
friends for two wee she was 16.

89
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,820
that she used her ATM card

90
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,180
that cost about as muc
e in the last quarter,

91
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,070
leads me to believe that

92
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:57,750
young Melanie decided to
at to escape her ovotects.

93
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,010
Still,her mother must be devastated.

94
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,860
They usually are.

95
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:12,120
I know you don't normally dream
aboung girls on shopping sprees,

96
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,690
but I'd like you to listen to these.

97
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,880
What are these?

98
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,990
They're some interviews I
did with Melanie's friends.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,190
I'd like you to listen to them and tell
me whether you get a feeling or whatever,

100
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,000
********

101
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,470
What's wrong

102
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,250
Nothing. I...

103
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,930
I just feel bad for her mother.

104
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,770
Not knowing be

105
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:50,540
Yobe a how much the human
constitution can withstand,Allison.

106
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,690
I just wanted to,I don't
know,give her a hug.

107
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,590
It's amazing how finding out this one new
thing about her makes the rest of it make sense.

108
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,340
I don't know what I
would do if I were her.

109
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,750
Well,**

110
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,840
Instead,you are someone who's going to
figure out how to make this meal edible.

111
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,850
I'm an engineer. You're a psychic.

112
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,680
Why can't we follow this recipe?

113
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,400
GETTE: This is stupid!

114
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,240
What you got there,Bridge?
What's stupid?

115
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,880
Science. Science is stupid.

116
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,630
That's a pretty bold statement.
What's all this about?

117
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,770
We're supposed to take this stupid solar
cell,make it turn on this light bulb.

118
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,820
olar cells are not stupid.

119
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,690
Th becomnergand then the energy
turns on the Christmas tree light.

120
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,160
But th stuIf it's sunny
outside,what's the pointng on a light b

121
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,330
Shgota point there

122
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,690
The point is toze yourself with other ways to
energize things an plugging them into a wall socket.

123
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,260
But why a light bulb?

124
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,780
Well,it doe have be a light b

125
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,280
You're right.Ituldnbe a light b at mb e

126
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,590
What do you want it to do?

127
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,200
I don't know.

128
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,370
Play music?

129
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,250
Okay,an d

130
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:05,380
I'm pretty sure Ariel's gotm box
he We could try and power that.

131
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,420
That might be fun.

132
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,760
Hey,where you going?

133
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,530
To get the boom box!

134
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,010
Don't scream. Doscre Don't
scream l kill you,okay?

135
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,210
Just calm down. Calm down.

136
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,390
It's okay.

137
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,770
*******

138
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,050
Good

139
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,210
No,don't cry.

140
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,120
Don't cry. He hates it when you cry.

an you... can you please untie me?

142
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,800

at t going on?

144
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,530
Where the hell is this place?

145
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,300
Middle of nowhere,as far as I can tell.

146
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:15,090
The last girl tried
screaming,but no one hears.

147
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,910
No one but him.

148
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,600
The last girl?

149
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,060
It seems like there's always two of us.

150
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,050
One of us out he one in there.

151
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:31,220
Onpsycho to play with,and
the other to watch

152
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,260
Oh,God! Oh,God!Oh,God!Oh,God!Oh,God!

153
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,870
It'll be okay.

154
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,750
g to get out of this. Somehow.

155
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,880
My... my name is Suzie.

156
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,640
Johanna.

157
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,700
So,how many days in the last
month woy you sought employment

158
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:10,920
or engaged in activities designed to bring
yo to the attentional emplo eseapredse

159
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:17,090
or a forms of employment outside of
your current field or specialization?

160
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:23,720
I would thatged one the above le second
of every single day just like last month.

161
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,490
And have you turned down any
offers of employment in tnth?

162
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,390
No,I haven't torn up
any ing ckets either.

163
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,040
d boch of money from my mother,though.

164
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,000
at was particularly pleasant.

165
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,030
The state doesn't have
m with that,does it?

166
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,180
Man humiliating himself by
asking his mother for money?

167
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,170
That's not gonna screw
up my $240 a week,is it?

168
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,980
Sorry,yere Go ahead.

169
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,460
Ask me the next one. The
one about the prospects.

170
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,230
That's my favorite. That's
the one I look forward to.

171
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,280
We have to ask theuest Mr. Dubois,in
the event that answactually chang

172
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:58,670
Isn't that the definition of crazy,doing the same thing over
and over again with the expectation of a different result?

173
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,200
Could I not say the
same thing back to you?

174
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,940
Mr. Dubois,you're a highly educated man.

175
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,980
he things you're doing
to find employment king.

176
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,760
are only two companies in Phoenix
that do work in your field,

177
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,310
and that in the near term,neither
one is going to hire you.

178
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,240
Why are you waiting for someone to
give you permission to earn a living?

179
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,680
I beg your pardon?

180
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,290
Never mind.

181
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,310

lay at normal speed.

185
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,130
You might need a couple more of these.

186
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,820
But I don't have any more.

187
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,480
Maybe if you...

188
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,340
if we ask your teacher for more.

189
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,140
Bu tea we can only use what
she gave us for the project.

190
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,830
Well,maybe if we talked to her.

191
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,270

It's two blocks from my house.

Every day of my life.

You're right.

Why didn't you say something?

254
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,140
I never say anything to anyone.

255
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,630
It's mine.

God laughing at me.

I think I ere he took
h e he k and the others.

The others?

265
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,280
There was at least one other.

266
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,740
Her name was Johanna.

269
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,190
something your daughter said.

270
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,180
She heard church bells.

271
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,110
It was underground,

272
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,960
but it wasn't a basement or
it wasn't just a basement.

273
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:43,200
And it looked like it was set up
like some kind of a fallout shelter,

274
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,080
which makes sens 'cause we
don'allyavesements here in P

I keep waiting for it to
fail,but it just won't fail.

331
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,610
I'm sorry. The topic of
the conversation is what?

332
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,080
My little solar-cell amplifion

333
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,560
I just hooked it upto the garage
door clicker,and it worked.

334
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,200
It powered that, too.

335
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,920
Excellent, Mr. Edison.

336
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:05,200
A clock radio that only works un
is t or you shine a lamp on it.

337
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,060
Hey, just 'cause your world isn't sunny,

338
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,320
that doesn't mean you
get to rain all over mine.

339
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,680
I'm sorry I wasn't listening.

340
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,180
I was watching the clock radio stop
working whenyou click the light off.

341
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,460
You're in a dark place,aren't you?

342
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,240
I still have my pi y decorations.

343
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,010
You want to borrow some?

344
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,340
Do you have any idea how to do this?

345
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,500
God,no.

346
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,460
Where did you get that?

347
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,010
I saw it upstairs,and I...

348
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,900
You know.

349
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,850
I thought maybe I could use it...

350
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,940
to pick the lock or...

351
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,500
But I don't know what I'm doing.

352
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,020
Do you think your mom
might really find us?

353
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,830
She's an investigator.

354
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,400
ally good at this stuff.

355
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,700
nice.

356
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,140
Itt beeling.

357
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,050
I'm sure your mom is
worried about you,too.

358
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,530
I'm sure she's out there looking.

359
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,330
My mom?

360
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,760
My mom is...

361
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,210
home right now and...

362
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,000
knitting me a sweater.

363
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,450
What are you talking about?

364
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,580
Nothing.

365
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:53,830
momto knit. She's.he'sitting.

366
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:59,750
Yeah,she even opened a yarn
store in Buxley,two towns over.

367
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,190
Any minute now,she's gonna...

368
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,870
burst in the door with a knitting needle and
threaten to stab our host in the heart with it.

369
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:02,020
No. No,no,no,no,no,no!

370
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,870
Get off her!

371
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:15,350
No! Don't! Let her
go!Let her go!Let her go!

372
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,390
Stop! Don't you...Oh,my
God...Stop it,please!

373
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,830
No! Stop!

374
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,850
Well,I went down to police headquarters.

375
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,380
lookthe mug books all
the way back to '95.

376
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,920
dn't see his picture.

377
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,770
But I have his face burned in my memory.

378
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,780
So this is the man you
saw kill this girl Johanna?

379
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,910
The same girl who-who was
trying to help my daughter?

380
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,690
She d in Or her mother lived in Buxley.

381
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,110
At least she owned a shop
there,a yarn store or something.

382
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,220
me to The Complicated Yarn.

383
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,470
What can I do for you?

384
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,100
CYNTHIA: Marion Wheeler?

385
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,320
Are you the owner of this store?

386
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,370
**

387
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,380
Actually,we're here to talk to you
about your daughter,Mrs. Wheeler.

388
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,670
Okay.

389
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,350
Again,who-who are you?

390
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,750
We're investigators working
on a missing persons case,

391
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,170
anthat happened nine years
ago. aughter's name came up.

392
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,630
I don't understand.

393
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,030
Johanna.

394
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,740
We're talking about Johanna.

395
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,450
We think we know what
might have happened to her.

396
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,740
M-My Johanna?

397
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:38,970
We thought yight filed
a police report,...

398
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,830
I have...

399
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,890
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

400
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,220
Johanna.

401
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,910
Her disappearance.

402
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,420
In 1998.

403
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,450
Okay,I'm sorry. There's...

404
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,430
Th-there's obviously someriblhere.

405
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,350
My dn't missing. She's
never been missing.

406
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,620
She never disappeared.

407
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,970
I mean,I was with her
yesterday here,and...

408
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,230
and-and I spoke to her
this morning. She's...

409
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,910
she's fine.

410
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,740
She's fine?

411
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,820
Uh,par-pardon me. Forgive me.

412
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:15,610
Do you have a picture of her?
If I could just look at her...

413
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,710
Uh,yes,I-right over here.

414
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,110
We took a trip to ndogether a couple

415
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,500
Oh,my goodness,that's her.

416
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,980
That's... that's who?

417
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,680
Thatdaughter. That's my Johanna.

418
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,960
And-and really,for
the life of me,I c...

419
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,370
I cannot figure out what
you people want with her.

420
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:46,470
Um,yo rigMr. We've obviously made
some sort of horrible mistake.

421
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,390
But she exists.

422
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,640
The fallout shelter exists.

423
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,250
It must mean something.

424
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,710
It means you're wrong.

425
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,100
It means I'm actually...

426
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,060
I'm actually angry that
that woman's daughter isn'

427
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,460
because she couldn't have been
there for my daughterinal moments

428
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,180
if,in fact,she was ever
even in that basement.

429
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,520
Cynthia!

430
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,540
I think we've come to the of Allison.

431
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,600
What does that mean?

432
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,280
It means...

433
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,600
I don't want to have anything
further to do with you.

434
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,940
I no longer want any
association with you.

435
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,320
ns you're fired!

436
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,590
Where can I drop you off?

437
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:40,170
INSPIRATION

438
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,700
Uh,I don't understand.

439
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,690
We're talking about Ariel's old toy?

440
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,220
Here's the thing: it isn't just a toy.

441
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,340
I actually think that
it might havel-woations.

442
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,860
I mean,there are problems on top of problems
but if I could lick even just a few of them...

443
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,820
Wait,slow down.

444
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,410
Are you telling me you think you...

445
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,560
you actually invented something?

446
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,110
I've a lot of things.

447
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,130
This... this would be
mine.This could be ours.

448
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:22,400
I mean,think about it: own *****

449
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,960
I mean,I'm actually starting to
think that everyg thhappened wit that

450
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:31,080
it was supposed to happen so that I
could be t this idea,have this new future.

451
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,960
I don't understand. w
dork?What do we do next?

452
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:38,700
We just put gnoutside the
house,"solar-cell amplifiers for sale"?

453
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:42,060
Well,that's what I've been trying to
figure out since 3:00 in the morning.

454
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:46,150
First thing I got to do is file a bunch
of legal papers,patents and things.

455
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:52,300
Then I got to get a working model built,ybe
pay for some testing,some studies s

456
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,780
o that I can show people
that it acly dwhat I say it

457
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:59,740
And then the key to thing

458
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,870
Wait a second.Wait a second

459
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,340
All that sounds expensive.

460
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,380
Well,that's why you meet
with the venture capitalists:

461
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,920
to get the money to start the business.

462
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:11,040
Yeah,but...

463
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,300
all the stuff before that
all the stuff foreit to them--

464
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,450
the lawyers and the
model and the studies.

465
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,060
Yeah,I figure all that's
gonna cost about 30,000.

466
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:24,180
Joe,come on.

467
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,460
$30,000? We don't even have $3,000.

468
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,630
I mean,Cynthia Keener
fired me yesterday.

469
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,930
We're getting $240 a week loyment.

470
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,840
We don't have money for
this kind of thing right now.

471
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,860
But we do.

472
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,230
Don't get that.

473
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,500
*****

474
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,850
We're in the middle of a conversation.

475
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,270
It's Cynthia.

476
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,850
Cynthia?

477
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,310
Allison.

478
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,650
I think I owe you another apology.

479
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,710
Uh,Cynthia,I don't know
what you're talking about.

480
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,710
Where are you?

481
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,580
You close to a television?

482
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,920
Turn on the news.

483
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,390
am I watching?

484
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,540
A man who's holding two girls against
their will was just killed by one of them.

485
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:12,470
Deputies sto the Turns out he kept them chained
up for days,assaulting them,beating them.

486
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,040
Any of this sound familiar?

487
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,830
Yeah,okay.

488
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,960
was just like your dream...

489
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:22,090
except it wasn't my daughter.

490
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,580
lanithe girl you were hired to find?

491
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,310
That's right.

492
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,390
Except she didn't run away.

493
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,500
She was abducted...

494
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,220
along with another girl.

495
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,440
Oh,my God.

496
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,760
And you're never going to
guess who the other girl is.

497
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,230
****

498
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:45,380
She was being wit Now,in the present?

499
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:50,270
Allison,let's take
our good news e we I...

500
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:56,160
lik you wanted to help me so
badly that,uh,people,places,

501
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:59,040
they just all got shuffled around,

502
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:04,140
but you were more right than
wrong sorry I snapped at you.

503
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:09,460
I hope you'll give some thought to the
idea of our continuing to work together.

504
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,310
I...

505
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,790
I'm sorry I dragged you out of bed.

506
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,280
Go back to sleep.

507
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,770
They found Melanie Linder with Johanna,the
girl I thought wathia's daughter.

508
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,060
The good news is everybody's alive.

509
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,300
No,I see that.

510
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:33,290
Well,here's to you.

511
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,850
Congratulations.

512
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,070
Case closed. It must feel good.

513
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:42,430
I can't figure out why I keep
dreaming about Cynthia's daughter

514
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,490
Okay,well,this is good.

515
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,800
You feel disturbed. I feel disturbed.

516
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,310
feel disturbed?

517
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,080
Why do you feel disturbed?

518
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,970
Aren't you the guy who
just had the big epiphany?

519
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,710
Yeah,I am.

520
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,320
trying to talk to my wife about it
and then the darnedest thing happened.

521
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,540
Yeah,the phone rang.

522
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,030
And you said you needed
$30,000 on't have $30,000.

523
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,560
But we do.********

524
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:07,420
There's almost $32,000
just sitting there.

525
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,240
You can't be serious.

526
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,820
Oh,I've never been more serious
about anything in my life.

527
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,810
I think this idea cobe wons.

528
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,440
That could pay for a lot of college.

529
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,430
What if it's worth nothing?

530
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,090
What if someone thought tre you did?

531
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,070
Where does that leave the girls?

532
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,080
You know I can't do this.

533
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:28,380
t to get that money,I have to sign
for it,too,and I can't do that.

534
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,080
God,isn't life funny?

535
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,260
I mean,this whole marriage has
always been about me believing in you.

536
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:37,900

shoe ends up up on the other foot...
