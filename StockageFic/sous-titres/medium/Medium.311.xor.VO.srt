00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,560
Oh, thank God.

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,000
Right here!

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,240
It's this way.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,160
He's in
the living room.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,800
(sobbing):
It's my husband.

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,960
He just collapsed.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,000
And I can't feel him
breathing.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,240
Ma'am, I need you
to step away.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,400
Ma'am, I need
you to step away.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,360
Ma'am, I need you
to step away.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,360
Please help him.
We will do the best
we can.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,120
Not a sound.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,400
Don't move.

15
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,400
GLEASON:
 <i>And the Department</i>
 <i>of Public Safety</i></i>

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,920
wants us to find two days
we can set aside

17
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,160
so they can send
a fellow down here

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,440
to teach us all this new
barcode system they've got

19
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,000
for arrest paperwork

20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,760
for cross-jurisdictional
and inter-departmental cases.

21
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,320
Two days?

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,560
For barcodes?

23
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,920
A most unusual story out
of the Southwest today...

24
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,520
after making what city
dispatchers assumed would be

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,280
a routine call to a house...

26
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,720
Sir, they're waiting for me
to call them back

27
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,200
...in the eastern suburbs
of Phoenix, Arizona.
with those dates.

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,960
Two Emergency Medical
Technicians

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,320
and their vehicle appear
to have vanished.

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,760
The District Attorney of Phoenix

31
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,840
had this to say.

32
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,120
I'd like to emphasize
that while we are vigorously

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,720
investigating the disappearance
of these men and their vehicle,

34
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,200
at the present time
there is no definitive proof

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,440
that they've actually met
with foul play.

36
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,760
That having been said...

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,320
Do you remember that lady?

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,080
Said she dreamt things?

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,040
From Phoenix.

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,800
You get me her number.

41
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:39,280
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@«Ú«Ú  
  sync:FRM@π€∫£Œ¿</font>

42
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,840
You are so mean.

43
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,160
Ariel, could you please
eat a little faster?

44
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,280
What are you talking about?

45
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,640
I'm eating
as fast as I can.

46
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,000
Mom!

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,840
Bridgette.

48
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,960
There's no need to shout,
I'm right here.

49
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,160
Make Ariel
eat faster.

50
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,400
Ariel, eat faster.

51
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,840
But, Mom, you're the one
who told me

52
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,480
that eating slow is good
for my digestion.

53
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,520
This is true.

54
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,080
This has nothing
to do with 'gestion!

55
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,240
This has to do with me
wanting to get to school

56
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,560
and Ariel trying
to make us late!

57
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,440
We're not gonna be late.

58
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,160
We are gonna leave
when we need to leave,

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,760
whether Ariel is
finished or not.

60
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,000
Are my ears
deceiving me,

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,920
or is our middle child
actually in a hurry

62
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,160
to get to school today?

63
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,080
We're having a special
assembly today.

64
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,320
And I don't want
to miss it.

65
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,040
And you're not
gonna miss it.

66
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,680
It's "Drug Awareness Day".

67
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,400
"Officer Bill" is
coming to school

68
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,960
to talk to the
kids about drugs.

69
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,480
Officer Bill, huh?

70
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,120
Mm, the "drug assembly".

71
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,440
Another rite of passe.

72
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,840
DEVALOS:
 <i>The ambulance answered</i>
 <i>a dispatch call</i></i>

73
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,680
from 29139 Alma Doarada Court.

74
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,000
The call came
from a prepaid cell phone.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,960
We now know the house

76
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,480
they were called to
has been on the market

77
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,120
unoccupied for five months.

78
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,320
So it was a set-up.

79
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,560
Certainly appears
that way.

80
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,040
But why would anyone want
to car-jack an ambulance?

81
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,440
Drugs, maybe
the equipment.

82
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,080
Could be it was personal.

83
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,720
We have officers
interviewing the families of the two EMTs.

84
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,960
Reviewing their records.

85
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,600
Maybe someone
had a beef.

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,080
Allison Dubois.

87
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,440
Well that's pretty damn
serendipitous...

88
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,040
seeing as how she's exactly
who I'm looking for.

89
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,520
Is this Captain Kenneth Push
of the Texas Rangers?

90
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,480
Well, talk about your
serendipity working overtime.

91
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,880
To what do I owe this pleasure?

92
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,480
Well I'm calling
kind of unofficially

93
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,080
on official business.

94
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,400
All right, I'm listening
unofficially

95
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,840
with both ears wide open.

96
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,720
I think I might've come
into some information regarding

97
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,600
those missing
Emergency Medical fellas

98
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,720
that have been on the news.

99
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,720
I'm holding a man here...

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,600
and I can't discuss it,
and neither can you.

101
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,320
He has ties to Arizona.

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,760
Are you familiar
with Desolation Trail,

103
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,400
to the junction of Route 65,
just east of Phoenix?

104
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,760
Yeah.

105
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,720
I think you might want
to have a look around there.

106
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,080
Will do.

107
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,040
What do I tell people?

108
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,280
How did I hear about this?

109
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,840
I don't know.

110
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,760
Tell 'em you dreamt it.

111
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,640
Okay, it's official.

112
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,880
Your sister's asleep.

113
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,080
Your mommy's already
kissed you good night.

114
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,440
It's after 8:30.

115
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,120
Now what's this nonsense
about "I'm waiting for Daddy"?

116
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,080
Mommy told you that
I was gonna work late.

117
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,680
I know, but I really wanted
my kiss,

118
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,800
and I have some really
important news.

119
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,320
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

120
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,280
You'll wake your sister.

121
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,840
All right.

122
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,720
There's your kiss.

123
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,960
Now, can this stuff wait
'til tomorrow?

124
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,200
'Cause Daddy's really tired.

125
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,800
Okay, what's this stuff?

126
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,880
Did you know that there's over
150 street names for heroin?

127
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,840
That's what you wanted
to tell me?

128
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,480
Okay.

129
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,560
Great.

130
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,800
A hundred and fifty.

131
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,000
Got it. Let's get some rest.

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,120
They call it "H,"
"big daddy,"

133
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,880
"reindeer dust"
and even "Bart Simpson".

134
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,120
Excellent.

135
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,360
Now we know.

136
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,280
Wanna hear the names
for PCP?

137
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,200
Uh, no, that's okay.

138
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,280
How 'bout marijuana?

139
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,400
Hey, Bridge...
"Mary Jane"...

140
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,360
"Panama Gold"
and there's "Spliff."

141
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,800
"Spliff", huh?

142
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,000
Hmm, yeah, I heard that one.

143
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,800
You have? Where'd you hear it?

144
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,640
Probably when I was
in drug assembly, years ago.

145
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,560
You had drug assembly?

146
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,440
Oh, yes.

147
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,040
So you learned
all about drugs.

148
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,600
Oh, yes.

149
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,560
So... you would never use them.

150
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh, yes, oh, no.

151
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,880
Not ever.

152
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,040
Not ever?
No.

153
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,880
Not ever.

154
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,360
Okay.

155
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,080
Great.

156
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,560
We're both drug free and ready
for a good night's sleep.

157
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,960
Don't let the
bed bugs bite.

158
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,840
I won't.

159
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,200
(whispering):
Wait, wait.

160
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,920
The ambulance drivers?

161
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,840
They found them?
They were there?

162
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,280
Oh, yeah, we found 'em.

163
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,920
What's left of them anyway.

164
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,320
At the bottom of
a 300-foot drop.

165
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,600
I'll call you when I know more.

166
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,160
Thank you.

167
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,520
Are you gonna fill me in?

168
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,320
Or am I gonna have to read
about it in the paper?

169
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,840
They found those EMTs.

170
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,160
Both dead.

171
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,800
Both... murdered.
(sighs)

172
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,720
That's terrible.

173
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,160
It's horrible.

174
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,280
But?

175
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,400
But...
and it's not a big thing.

176
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,760
I told them that I knew
where they were.

177
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,000
That I had a dream.

178
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,320
Okay.

179
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,960
But I didn't really
have a dream.

180
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,840
Captain Push called me
this morning from Texas.

181
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,680
He told me where they were.

182
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,320
I guess I just feel
kinda funny about lying

183
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,280
and getting credit,
all of that.

184
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,800
Boy, I gotta tell you.

185
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,960
On the scale
of white lies...

186
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,800
that's got to be
about the whitest.

187
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,360
And who cares where
the clue came from?

188
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,040
I mean, the important thing
is that we now know

189
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,360
that these guys
were murdered.

190
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,400
Which means you
and your friends

191
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,360
can get on
with the business

192
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,240
of trying to figure out
who did it and why.

193
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,280
Who you calling now?

194
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,120
Captain Push.

195
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,240
I wanna let him know
and thank him.

196
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,960
Allison, it's almost 10:00.

197
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,800
It's almost 11:00 in Texas.

198
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,080
Don't you think it'll hold
'til morning?

199
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,600
That's an excellent
choice.

200
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,960
Now just turn off that light
and warm up that bed.

201
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,040
'Cause Daddy's tired and he's
got some serious sleeping to do.

202
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,160
This way.

203
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,080
SECURITY GUARD:
Don't move.

204
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,560
What are you doing?

205
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,200
What does it look
like I'm doing?

206
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,640
Push here.

207
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,880
Hey, it's Allison.

208
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,040
Did I wake you?

209
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,880
I, I have some good news.

210
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,880
I, I mean, it's horrible news,

211
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,520
but I thought you'd want
to know.

212
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,480
Okay.

213
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Well, we found those EMTs.

214
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,280
They were
right where you said they'd be.

215
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,160
They'd been murdered.

216
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,720
Ambushed and murdered.

217
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,360
Anyway...

218
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,040
I wanted to thank you.

219
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,600
Don't thank me.

220
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,640
I didn't do anything.

221
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,440
You okay?

222
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,240
Me?

223
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,280
Never better.

224
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,160
Oops, I've been
caught on the phone

225
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,800
with a strange man
by my husband,

226
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
so I'll have to take
you at your word.

227
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,240
Well, tell, uh, your husband
the strange man says "hey."

228
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,760
Will do.

229
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,840
JOE:
I need you girls ready
in five minutes.

230
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,040
Mommy's got a
dentist appointment.

231
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,600
I got sticky hands.
I know.

232
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,720
So I'm taking you
to school today.

233
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,720
Daddy can't be
late for work.

234
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,760
Has anyone seen
Bridgette?

235
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,760
Bridge!

236
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,240
Bridgette,
what are you looking for?

237
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,640
Hey, everybody,
what's the big occasion?

238
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,720
I don't know,
it looks--

239
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,640
I think maybe Bridge was just
going through my drawers.

240
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,920
It looked like maybe she
was looking for something.

241
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,280
Is that true,
honey?

242
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,880
Were you looking
for something?

243
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,520
Do you need
something?
N-No.

244
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,840
I don't know.

245
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,160
Well, you know what?

246
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,120
Whatever it is is gonna have

247
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,160
to wait until tonight,

248
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,880
um, 'cause I got work and the kids have school.

249
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,120
Bridge, I need you in the car.

250
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,960
I swear I have no idea
what that was about.

251
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,080
Good luck at the dentist.

252
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,720
Don't remind me.

253
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,760
Whoever you are,
I can't do this right now.

254
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,600
I'm late.

255
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,160
I'm l-late. Ow!

256
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,320
Late, late, late.

257
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,280
Captain Push.

258
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,920
You want to hear a story?

259
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,720
You dreamt it?

260
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,640
For months now.

261
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,080
Little bits at first.

262
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,160
The ambulance light,

263
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,240
the wood floor
of the living room.

264
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,320
Then bigger pieces.

265
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,640
The ambulance being called
to the scene,

266
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,320
what happens
in the house.

267
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,200
It didn't all come together
in one event till a couple weeks ago.

268
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,000
Didn't know
what to make of it

269
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,080
till I saw your boss
on the TV yesterday afternoon.

270
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,160
I thought I was going crazy.

271
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,720
Might go yet.

272
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,360
That's why I flew
all this way.

273
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,600
That's why I showed up
like I did.

274
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,880
That and, uh...

275
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,000
...one more thing.

276
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,960
I saw the people
who did this.

277
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,080
I know what they look like.

278
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,920
I cannot walk into a room

279
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,120
full of other
police professionals

280
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,320
and offer my help based on
the fact that I've had a dream.

281
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,560
But you did have a dream.

282
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,760
You were in a coma for months.

283
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,840
I have to believe something
could happen to your brain

284
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,880
if you're gone that long.

285
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,120
I'm not an expert, but...

286
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,360
It's gotta be you.

287
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,080
When we're in that room
looking at those pictures,it's gotta be you.

288
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,320
You had the dream.

289
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,640
You're looking for the faces.

290
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,960
Speaking of which,

291
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,600
when was the last time you
saw your cardiologist?

292
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
Oh, cardio...

293
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,280
Okay, I'm gonna call
Phoenix General.

294
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,040
I'm sure your old friends will
be thrilled to see you again.

295
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,400
Everybody who's anybody
in Phoenix crime.

296
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,160
Black males back
to about '97.

297
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,360
Also, white women
back to the mid '90s.

298
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,520
Also got the crime scene
photos in this folder

299
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,040
in case you need
a mory jogger.

300
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,520
Can I buy you a cup
of coffee, Captain?

301
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,360
I promised Ms. Dubois here
I'd keep her company.

302
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,800
Take a rain check, though.

303
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,680
All right.

304
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,280
Sorry to have wasted
your time, Allison.

305
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,040
I saw it so clearly
in my mind.

306
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,080
No.

307
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,240
No need to apologize.

308
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,760
I shouldn't have to tell
you all this means is

309
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,440
that our killers haven't
committed any crimes

310
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,440
in the Phoenix area.

311
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,880
We'll find them.

312
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,960
I guess this is the house.

313
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,520
Yeah.

314
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,200
And who's this?

315
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,600
That's one of the EMTs
who was murdered.

316
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,720
There's something wro...

317
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,200
Are you telling me
these are the two people

318
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,640
you pulled out of that ravine?

319
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,080
Yeah.

320
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,120
I saw two white men.

321
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,760
In my dream,
they were both white men.

322
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,000
Okay.

323
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,120
Sometimes dreams are like that.

324
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,680
Sometimes the details are
dead-on, and other times...

325
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,560
I-I don't know. This...

326
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,080
This whole thing
doesn't sit right.

327
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,240
You know what you need?

328
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,640
I was thinking dinner.

329
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,800
ALLISON:
 <i>Ariel, hang up the phone!</i></i>

330
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,760
All right, time for the
daily phone intervention.

331
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,480
You seem awfully taciturn,
young lady.

332
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,400
Bridgette.

333
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,440
Honey, we have a guest.

334
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,480
The polite thing to do

335
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,640
when you have a guest is
to make conversation.

336
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,760
Why don't you tell Captain
Push about your day?

337
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,080
Yes, indeed.

338
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,600
Tell me
about your day.

339
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,720
Okay.

340
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,880
Well...
(chuckles)

341
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,560
...doesn't have to be
about your day.

342
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,640
Tell me about anything.

343
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Tell me what's
on your mind.

344
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,520
I'd love to hear it.

345
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,160
I'm a pretty
good listener.

346
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,160
I don't want to tell you.

347
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,160
Well, okay.

348
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,680
Just...

349
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,120
sometimes it's good to get
things off your chest.

350
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,880
Especially if something's
bothering you.

351
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,720
You won't like it.

352
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,560
I won't like what's
bothering you?

353
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,960
It's against the law.

354
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,800
Oh, you did something
against the law?

355
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,680
No. My daddy did.

356
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,840
Bridgette,
what are you talking about?

357
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,840
I saw Daddy smoking drugs.

358
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,200
Daddy?

359
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,360
I saw Daddy smoking drugs!

360
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,320
All right, here we are.

361
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,680
One big, happy, fam...

362
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,400
ALLISON:
Hey, shh...

363
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,160
Bridge?

364
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,760
Shh!

365
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,040
Don't throw my daddy in jail!

366
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,960
Jail?

367
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,440
Daddy, are you going
to jail?

368
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,800
What?  What's she
talking about?

369
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,680
Mom?

370
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,280
Ariel, just don't
talk right now.

371
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,840
Sit down, just
eat your dinner.

372
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,800
Bridgette, honey,
how about you and me

373
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,720
go in your room and
talk about this, okay?

374
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,080
Come on.

375
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,080
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I'm sorry.

376
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,840
Did I miss something?

377
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,800
Wh-What's going on?

378
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,920
Just entertain our guest.

379
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,760
Okay, you're upset.
I can see that.

380
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,960
But to be honest with you,
I'm mystified.

381
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,640
You're mystified?

382
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,200
Apparently, your daughter looked
you straight in the eye

383
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,520
and asked you if you
ever did drugs, if you
would ever do drugs.

384
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,880
And you said?
"Never."

385
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,080
I admit it-- that's
what I said, "Never."

386
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,880
Which way to
the electric chair?

387
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,760
You lied!

388
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,360
Uh, yeah, you're
damn right I lied.

389
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,400
And I would do it again.

390
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,080
Are you forgetting?
She's eight.

391
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,280
We can't expect her
to understand things

392
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,000
either of us might have done
years ago.

393
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,560
Before we were a family.

394
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
She's not old enough to
understand the social context

395
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,400
of college life in the '80s.

396
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,680
She's a kid.

397
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,800
Yeah, she's a kid who
sees things!

398
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,320
Things that make
her really smart

399
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,480
about being able
to know

400
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,320
who's telling the truth
and who's lying.

401
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,840
Is that what
this is about?

402
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,080
She saw me?
Smoking something?
In her head?

403
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,800
Well, I hope you told
her it wasn't true.
No!

404
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,440
What?!

405
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,760
Joe, I spent my
entire childhood

406
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,560
having my mother tell me
the things I saw

407
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,640
in my head were nonsense.

408
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,880
I'm not doing that
to my girls.

409
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,320
But this isn't about you
and your mother.

410
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,680
It's about me and
my daughter.

411
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,120
So what did you tell her?

412
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,680
I said, "If Daddy did that,

413
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,800
"it was probably a
really long, long time ago,

414
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,080
and he fibbed about
it because he was ashamed."

415
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,760
Ashamed.

416
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,880
Well, you're not
proud of it, are you?

417
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,400
It's not... one of the
highlights of my life, no.

418
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,760
But I don't think
I would describe it

419
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,480
as a period of
enormous shame either.

420
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,000
Well, I didn't have
a lot of choices.

421
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,240
You'd already
lied to her.

422
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,360
She was already
hysterical.

423
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,800
So now she thinks
I'm a liar,

424
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,840
a drug addict and
filled with shame.

425
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,480
You can't lie
to these kids.

426
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,600
What would you
prefer that I said?

427
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,480
Wait, forget that.

428
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,960
What if she had asked you,
Miss Holier-Than-Thou?

429
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,840
Or are you
forgetting

430
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,280
your own sordid past?

431
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,800
I'm not forgetting anything.

432
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,960
I'd like to hope that I would
find a way to tell my child

433
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,400
that people make mistakes.

434
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,200
People learn and they change
and they grow.

435
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,880
And it is every parent's wish
that their child

436
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,800
avoid making the same
bad choices

437
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,120
their parents might have made.

438
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,360
Ooh, aren't we
impressive?

439
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,720
In the safety of our bed,
in the safety of our room,

440
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,280
with no children
anywhere in sight,

441
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,920
giving you that
eight-year-old stare.

442
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,360
Oh, well,
okay, fine.

443
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,680
We'll just
see, won't we?

444
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,080
'Cause the next time

445
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,400
the word "drugs"
or "sex"

446
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,840
or "tattoos"
or "piercings"

447
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,120
comes out of one of our
psychic children's mouths,

448
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,840
I'm tossing you in
front of the bus.

449
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,200
And don't think
I won't do it.

450
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,320
You're so lucky
that couch is taken.

451
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,520
I'm a lot of things, but
lucky ain't one of them.

452
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,640
I-I don't understand.

453
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,920
Why didn't you tell me
about this dream before?

454
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,360
PUSH:
There was nothing to tell.

455
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,720
It was a couple people
I wasn't even sure existed

456
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,160
doing things in places
that had no names, no location.

457
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,280
Well, not till tonight, anyway.

458
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,640
It was a dream,

459
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,240
for crying out loud.

460
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,720
Pretty much nailed it.

461
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,520
Harrigan Construction
and Demolition.

462
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,680
Killed the guy
in the guardhouse,

463
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,720
cut a couple locks with torches,
then made off with

464
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,640
almost half a dozen
bricks of C-4.

465
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,080
They... they cut the locks
with torches?

466
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:25,760
Well, whatever.

467
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,200
The end result's
virtually the same.

468
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,600
I'd say, uh,
you're two for two, lady.

469
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,040
Captain.

470
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,880
I'd say you're
two for two, fella.

471
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,440
So, these people, now they have
an ambulance and explosives.

472
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,960
You didn't happen
to have a dream

473
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,560
that you didn't share with me
that might shed some light

474
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,720
on what they're
planning on doing

475
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,360
with a bunch of explosives,
did you?

476
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,000
No.

477
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,680
But even if I did, and
even if there were,

478
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,520
I'm not sure I'd be inclined to
believe what it was showing me.

479
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,360
This place,
that building,

480
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,000
it's all...
it's not right.

481
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,520
It's not what I saw.

482
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,360
What are you talking about?

483
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,040
Harrigan Construction,
just like in your dream.

484
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,480
Yeah, the name's the same, but
everything else is different.

485
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,160
The... buildings,

486
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,760
the lettering
on the sign,

487
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,280
there's no guard shack
at the main gate,

488
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,040
nobody was cutting any
locks with torches.

489
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,720
This is all...

490
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,840
wrong.

491
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,560
Didn't you
mention to me

492
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,560
that the woman's chin
was more triangular?

493
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,640
Oh, yeah, yeah.

494
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,880
I did, yeah.

495
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,240
Uh, actually, I think I used
that word "triangular."

496
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,480
Her chin.

497
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,800
Excuse me.

498
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,720
It's sad.

499
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,040
She has a keen intuition
but a feeble memory.

500
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,480
Yeah.

501
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,680
Of course I can bring him down
early this evening.

502
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,280
ALLISON:
Uh, excuse me.

503
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,920
(whispers):
Yeah.

504
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,720
That was the hospital
returning my call.

505
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,880
When is the last time
you saw your doctor in Texas?

506
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,120
There's some issue
with your pacemaker.

507
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,920
They want to open you up
and fix whatever it is.

508
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,560
They want me to bring you
in there this evening,

509
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,200
do the procedure in the morning.

510
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,600
It's not supposed
to be a big deal.

511
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,960
Are you gonna say anything?

512
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,000
You and your family
ever had real Texas chili?

513
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,400
I call the phone!

514
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,200
Don't worry, no one's
gonna want the dumb old phone.

515
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,960
Girls...

516
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,840
It's nice of you to offer
to make dinner, but...

517
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,080
No buts.

518
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,840
Chili's a man's job.

519
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,920
Besides, if I
let you help me,

520
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,040
you might find out
my secret recipe.

521
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,040
Now, just go...

522
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,800
take a bath or something.

523
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,800
Come back and get me
when it's time

524
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,240
to drive me to the hospital.

525
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,000
You drive a
hard bargain.

526
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,440
You want to help?

527
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,000
What are you making?

528
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,880
Finest Texas chili

529
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,400
this side of the Colorado River.

530
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,200
Wait till you taste it.

531
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,440
That's okay. I'm not hungry.

532
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,320
It's hard to have an appetite
when your daddy's a liar.

533
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,680
(whispers):
Come here.

534
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,280
Whoa, baby.

535
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,000
I understand how
you feel, by the way.

536
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,440
Oh, yeah?

537
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,720
Sure.

538
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,760
Somebody I trusted

539
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,200
told me a lie once.

540
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,720
My mama.

541
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,560
Your mom?

542
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,320
It was a big lie, too.

543
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,240
See... my daddy left

544
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,600
when I was a baby.

545
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,720
Once I got old enough to ask
after his whereabouts...

546
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,760
my mama told me
he was dead.

547
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,680
And he wasn't?

548
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,360
He was alive and tearing it up.

549
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,440
Were you mad
at your mom for lying?

550
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,840
Oh, heck yeah,
I was mad.

551
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,360
The next day, I joined
the Texas Rangers,

552
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,520
learned how to track a man,
so I could find my daddy.

553
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,560
And did you
find him?

554
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,720
I found him, all right.

555
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,920
Was in a bar
outside El Paso.

556
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,320
And he wasn't fit to be
anybody's daddy.

557
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,960
Man was a mean-spirited,
card-cheating,

558
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,680
lying, angry drunk.

559
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,840
Didn't care anything
about anybody.

560
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,360
Sure wasn't proud
to see how I turned out.

561
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,080
Wow.

562
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,040
Yeah.

563
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,960
You know what I did?

564
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,040
I went crawling home

565
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,280
to my mama and begged her
to forgive me

566
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,600
for how I treated her.

567
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,720
And did she forgive you?

568
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,680
Of course.

569
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,080
She knew what kind of man
my daddy really was.

570
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,760
And she knew
how upset I'd be

571
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,880
if I ever found out
the truth.

572
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Which is why
she told me that lie.

573
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I was too bull-headed
to understand it,

574
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,960
but she lied to me

575
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,080
because she loved me.

576
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,920
She lied to me to protect me.

577
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,800
We understand each other?

578
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,040
I think so.

579
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,800
Good.

580
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,600
So...

581
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,960
why don't you put those
tomatoes in that pot?

582
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,280
I er tell you how much
I hate these places?

583
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,040
That's peculiar.

584
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,440
Most of the people I know
love going to the hospital.

585
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,880
They can't get enough of it.

586
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,680
MAN:
Captain Push.

587
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,760
I'm sorry to keep you.

588
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,120
My 5:00 ran long.

589
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,360
I'm Dr. Sanborn,
head of Cardiology here at Phoenix General.

590
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,800
Welcome back.

591
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,440
Be nice.
 (chuckles)

592
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,600
This is my friend,
Allison Dubois.

593
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,560
Nice to meet you.

594
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,520
The physician who actually did
your surgery

595
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,680
is out of the country.

596
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,160
This is a fairly
minor procedure.

597
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,320
If you're agreeable,

598
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,840
I can certainly take
care of it for you.

599
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,720
Frankly, the sooner
you get it done...

600
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,040
I mean, there have been
a couple of product failures.

601
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,520
Well, head of the department.
You can't get better than that.

602
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,720
So, have, uh, Mike and Janice
stopped by to say hello?

603
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,360
I'm sorry,
Mike and Janice?

604
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,680
Apparently, they were
your ICU nurses

605
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,840
when you were a patient here.

606
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,640
It's okay
if you don't remember.

607
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,320
I'm told you were in a coma
for much of your stay.

608
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,400
And I'm told
I'm absolutely
delightful

609
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,040
to be with when
I'm in a coma.

610
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,400
Seriously, you woke up.

611
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,840
I know it doesn't sound
like much,

612
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,200
but given the depth
and duration of your coma,

613
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,280
it's something of a minor
miracle.

614
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,520
When you work
the ICU,

615
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,840
you remember the miracles.

616
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,920
Hey!

617
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,280
Nice.

618
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,880
Yeah, I think
it might actually
be the same room

619
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,200
as I had last time.

620
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,920
No, you were in a lot
of different rooms
last time.

621
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,000
When you were here,
you were in big rooms

622
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,840
with a lot of beds.

623
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,560
Private rooms like this.

624
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,880
They all kind
of look alike,
but no.

625
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,440
I see you have
your sleeping pill

626
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,760
and your fashionable
sleeping attire.

627
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,760
You're just jealous.

628
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,400
I did a little
checking on your two
favorite nurses.

629
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,080
It turns out

630
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,200
they were both working
the night shift all week

631
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,200
so there's no way they could
have been here and...

632
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,200
They've been at the
hospital forever.

633
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,320
Everyone describes them
as "lifers."

634
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,600
And everyone just
adores them.

635
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,120
So they're neither
my ambulance-jackers

636
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,400
nor my explosives thieves.

637
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,000
No, just really
great nurses.

638
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,720
Uh... Joe's gonna be walking
in the door right about now.

639
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,760
Hey, I promise you
I will be here
in the morning

640
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,560
before you get out
of surgery, okay?

641
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,440
What if I have another dream?

642
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,680
Seriously, if you need
anything, call me.

643
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,440
Daddy's home.

644
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,200
Hold your applause.

645
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,000
Hey.
Hey.

646
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,080
Mom had to drive
Captain Push

647
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,440
to the hospital
for something.

648
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,680
I don't think it was
a big deal, though,

649
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,160
because he made his chili
before she took him.

650
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,000
Mm, chili. Excellent.

651
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,480
Where are your sisters?

652
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,520
Um, Marie fell asleep
on my bed.

653
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,960
I was reading her
a story.

654
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,240
That's all right.

655
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,680
I'll carry her
back to her room.

656
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,480
And Bridgette's
been getting ready
for bed

657
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,200
for, like, an hour
and a half.

658
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:22,960
Yeah?

659
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,600
I think she's waiting
for a kiss.

660
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,880
From me?

661
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,960
The fugitive? The liar?

662
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,400
I don't think so.

663
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,240
Bridge, it's Daddy.

664
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,560
I just want to let you know
that I'm here

665
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,360
if you want a kiss.

666
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,160
If you want to wait
for Mommy, that's cool, too.

667
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,560
Oh! Hey!

668
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,800
Bridge...

669
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,640
I'm so glad
you're home!

670
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,480
Oh, God, I'm glad
to be home.

671
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,320
It's good to be
home with you.

672
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,040
It's good to
see you, honey.

673
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,400
I made you a picture.

674
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,440
It's of you and me
on the carousel.

675
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,880
Yeah?
Do you like it?

676
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,480
Doesn't it look
exactly like you?

677
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,320
I like it.
Of course, I like it.

678
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,840
Look at that.
It looks just like me.

679
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,520
Oh, Daddy,
you're such a liar.

680
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,680
MAN'S VOICE: 
The key to it is getting
an ambulance.

681
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,600
Ambulances
can go anywhere.

682
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,800
Nobody questions
an ambulance.

683
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,320
Okay, but how do we get our
hands on one?

684
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,280
We take it.

685
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,280
We call for one
and we take it.

686
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,160
Really?

687
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,160
Don't they usually show up
with people attached?

688
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,000
EMT's, doctors,
whatever?

689
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,440
I don't understand

690
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,240
why you're having
difficulty with this.

691
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,640
You've never disposed
of a body before?

692
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,400
Aren't you the one
who taught me about
Desolation Junction?

693
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,240
Come on, this
is a good idea.

694
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,080
I need you
to get on board.

695
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,680
Fine. Fine, I'm on board.

696
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,000
But I still don't get it.

697
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,520
How do we get you
out of here?

698
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,040
I don't know.

699
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,000
We're going to need

700
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,040
a huge distraction.

701
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,760
An explosion, maybe.

702
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,720
You know how to get your hands
on explosive, don't you?

703
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,960
Yeah, of course I do.

704
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,480
It's why God invented
construction companies.

705
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,040
I'm confused.
I mean,when is this
gonna happen?

706
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,400
The court order
says they have

707
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,200
to schedule
a hospital visit
for me every year,

708
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
year and a half
to check for polyps.

709
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,120
So, ideally, it would
be the next time I'm here.

710
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,680
What about
collateral damage?

711
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,800
There's gonna be smoke.

712
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,520
We want to knock out
the power.

713
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,160
What about all
your roommates here?

714
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,720
These guys?
(scoffs)

715
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,000
They're halfway gone already.

716
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,440
Comas, worse.

717
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,400
That guy over there,

718
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,120
he's a cop of some kind
from Texas.

719
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,960
Been unconscious
for months.

720
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,600
We'd probably be doing him
a favor.

721
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,440
NURSE:
Captain Push?
Are you awake?

722
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,880
Captain Push?

723
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,080
Hi. It's 5:00 a.m.

724
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,800
I'm here to take you
down to surgery.

725
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,240
There we go.

726
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,000
Hmm, we have a little
extra security in
place today.

727
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,080
I'll be right back.

728
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,120
I'm gonna make a run for it.

729
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,960
Yeah, he's in with the doctors
right now.

730
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,520
Don't worry about where
I got it.

731
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,480
That's why God invented
construction companies.

732
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,600
Just wait
for my signal.

733
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,560
How do I feel?

734
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,000
How do you think I feel?

735
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,880
I don't know.

736
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,480
How'd you like to have
three feet of tubing

737
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,760
shoved up your ass?

738
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,920
All right, Captain Push,
I'll take you in now.

739
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,680
That man cuffed to the chair
with that guard,

740
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,520
who was that?

741
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,360
Um, I believe his name
is Sergei something.

742
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,360
Supposedly, he's with
the Serbian mob.

743
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,360
Or maybe it's Bosnian,
I'm not sure.

744
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,280
They brought him in
from the state penitentiary

745
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,720
to have a colonoscopy.

746
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,680
I swear, those prisoners have
a better medical plan than I do.

747
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,000
Has he been in here before,
this hospital?

748
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,080
Actually, yeah, about a year,
maybe a year and a half ago.

749
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,200
He had some polyps
removed.

750
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,160
When they bring
a prisoner in,

751
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,080
they tighten up security
all over the hospital.

752
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,440
It's a real pain
in the neck.

753
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,760
All right.

754
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,800
Now, you're gonna feel
a little woozy.

755
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,600
I've got to get to a phone,
make a call.

756
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,680
No, now is

757
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,120
probably not a good time.

758
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,360
There you go.

759
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,000
Okay?

760
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,960
(slurring):
Phone... it's important.

761
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,680
Don't you worry,
Captain Push,

762
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,200
everything's gonna be
just fine.

763
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,640
Fine...

764
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,080
Doctor, please call.

765
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,640
Please call.

766
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,640
What's he saying,
"police" or "please"?

767
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,120
Please call.???

768
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,240
Let's give the cowboy
a little more fairy dust.

769
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,360
Make sure he's completely
in dream land.

770
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,520
Call... (mumbling)

771
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,320
Ah!

772
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,640
What the hell?

773
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,120
Yeah.

774
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,880
(alarms blaring)
Let's get him out of here.

775
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,720
Come on. Give me a hand.

776
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,240
Let's go this way.
Go this way.

777
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,840
Wait, wait, wait.

778
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,560
Over here.

779
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:35,880
Go, go, go, go!

780
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,520
Go, go, go!

781
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,680
Please help.

782
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,920
It's all right, cowboy.

783
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,480
Please call...

784
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,080
Shine that flashlight!
I can't see a damn thing!

785
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,120
Let's hurry.

786
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,680
Don't worry.
The ambulance is waiting.

787
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,640
Allison, what
are you doing?
What's going on?

788
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,720
Lay back down.
It's 3:00 in the morning.

789
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,320
It's 3:00?

790
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,680
Are you sure?

791
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,120
I don't know.
It's dark.

792
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,720
Clock says 3:00.
I'm pretty sure.

793
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,360
They haven't operated yet.

794
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,080
Then there's still time.

795
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,920
Time for what?

796
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,840
NURSE: Captain Push.
Hi. It's 5:00 a.m.

797
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,560
I'm here to take you
down to surgery.

798
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,920
I'll be back
in a moment, okay?

799
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,600
How did you sleep?

800
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,880
Did you get any sleep at all?

801
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,560
Allison, this is important.

802
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,800
We don't have much time.

803
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,120
You calm down.

804
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,680
There's a plan I heard about

805
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,960
when I was in a coma
a year and a half ago.

806
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,840
Okay, I believe you.

807
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,600
They're gonna blow up
this hospital today.

808
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,880
Minutes from now.

809
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,720
It's got nothing to do with
seeing the future,

810
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,280
nothing to do with dreams.

811
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,600
You got to believe me.

812
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,880
I know what I'm talking about.

813
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,920
I'm a lawman,
I'm not psychic.

814
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,040
Yeah, but I am.

815
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,800
You can stop pacing any time.

816
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,200
I can see the ambulance
parked out there

817
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,800
and your crew hasn't lit
the fuse yet.

818
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,880
What's the problem?

819
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,880
They're paid to be thorough.

820
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,040
Let them be thorough.

821
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,000
Time to go.

822
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,920
It is that, gentlemen.

823
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,280
And don't even think ????

824
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,960
PUSH:
Oh, that'll be my cab.

825
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,400
I'm gonna go see.

826
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,360
Me, too.

827
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,320
Me three.

828
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,280
You know, you should've let us
drive you to the airport.

829
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,280
Oh, please, it's Sunday.

830
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,040
Besides, y'all have already
extended me

831
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,280
way more hospitality than anyone
has a right to expect.

832
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,440
Nonsense.
True.

833
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,360
Let me get that.

834
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,800
Thank you.

835
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,600
Well, I guess this is it.

836
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,040
It? You think so?

837
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,240
Something tells me
you will be back.

838
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,840
What do you mean?

839
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,720
You think I might need
another tune-up.

840
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,600
(chuckles):
What do I look like,
a fortune teller?

841
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,520
I just sense
that you'll be back.

842
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,480
Till we meet again.

843
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:25,080
Oh, if you see my daddy's ghost,
please tell him

844
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,480
I'm sorry I had to tell
such a tall tale about him.

845
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,840
He'll understand.

846
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,440
Ask your middle child.
She knows all about it.

847
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:43,280
