1
00:00:03,276 --> 00:00:04,442
Hurry! It's coming!

2
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:15,413
Climb!

3
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:19,888
We're almost there.

4
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:22,136
Can't make it.

5
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:23,488
Shut up and run!

6
00:00:55,174 --> 00:00:56,073
You okay?

7
00:00:57,444 --> 00:00:59,359
Yeah, I'm okay. Go on back to sleep.

8
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,274
Was it the one with the train again?

9
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:02,929
Yeah.

10
00:01:03,557 --> 00:01:04,772
And now your head aches?

11
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:08,882
Yeah. No. I don't know. I'm just...

12
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:13,511
I'm gonna go watch some TV and make some potato salad.

13
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:16,978
- Potato salad?
- Yeah. The cookout.

14
00:01:17,074 --> 00:01:20,033
Alan and Kamala's tomorrow... today.

15
00:01:21,058 --> 00:01:23,930
Allison... it's been what? Like two weeks now?

16
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:25,682
I don't know, Joe. Something like that.

17
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:29,106
Every night, it's the same dream. Every night, you wake up.

18
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:31,851
You can't get back to sleep. Every night, I wake up.

19
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:33,023
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,232
I'm not looking for apologies, sweetie. I'm looking for a solution. I mean, this can't go on.

21
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:40,195
- I told you, I'll go sleep in the other room.
- That's not a solution.

22
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:42,715
Well, it's the best I can do at 3:44 in the morning.

23
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,681
Maybe it's time to get some help.

24
00:01:44,908 --> 00:01:45,726
Help?

25
00:01:46,095 --> 00:01:49,383
I don't know. Maybe there's somebody out there you can talk to, like a professional, or...

26
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:52,249
A psychic shrink? A shrink for psychics?

27
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:55,946
An abnormal behaviorist for paranormal people? Yeah.

28
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:57,204
All right, you're making fun of me.

29
00:01:57,296 --> 00:01:58,805
I don't think there's any help for this.

30
00:01:58,907 --> 00:02:02,076
To be honest... I'm just... tired.

31
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:03,840
Then come back to bed.

32
00:02:04,128 --> 00:02:05,449
I don't think that's a good idea.

33
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,871
I don't really care what you think. Bed, woman.

34
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:17,025
- I'm so exhausted.
- Well, close your eyes.

35
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:21,579
What's the point?

36
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,051
Come on, you have to try.

37
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:47,563
I give up.

38
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:36,392
That's absurd. That is an absurd assertion.

39
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:39,264
You're telling me the drug companies are no longer interested in developing cures?

40
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,534
You think about it.

41
00:03:40,697 --> 00:03:42,601
You're talking about a business whose lifeblood...

42
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:45,637
you'll pardon the pun... is sick people.

43
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:48,499
If everyone's well, then nobody needs drugs.

44
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:51,137
That's why the most forward-thinking drug companies

45
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:54,583
are putting their money into developing drugs that treat symptoms.

46
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,158
Treat the symptom but don't cure the illness.

47
00:03:57,327 --> 00:04:00,342
It's the illness that's going to keep making you the money down the road.

48
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:02,739
It's the illness that's your bread and butter.

49
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:04,581
Someone's had enough to drink.

50
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:06,962
Would that be me, darling?

51
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:11,613
You wanna see something?

52
00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:12,692
Look!

53
00:04:13,783 --> 00:04:15,867
What do you think? Are you ready to talk dowry yet?

54
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:18,133
They are cute, aren't they?

55
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:21,734
But I think I'm going to encourage her to play the field till she's four or five.

56
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,453
So, how do you think we're doing?

57
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:27,561
Do you thing the party's achieved lift-off?

58
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:28,456
What do you mean?

59
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:30,336
I don't know.

60
00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:33,658
My friends from the university and his friends from the lab.

61
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,199
I'm just not sure everyone's mixing too well.

62
00:04:36,561 --> 00:04:37,391
Alan?

63
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,066
Your wife's getting anxious.

64
00:04:39,132 --> 00:04:42,015
Stop talking to everybody you see every day at work and go mix.

65
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:46,166
Aye, aye.

66
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:47,902
Thank you...

67
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:53,632
How's your head?

68
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:58,102
Pounding. If I wasn't so exhausted, I'd shoot myself.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,824
Wait!

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,783
Excuse me!

71
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:07,512
Excuse me.

72
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,323
Just waiting for the bathroom.

73
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:21,797
So... what is it exactly that you're postulating?

74
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:27,276
I'm saying that we are containers for a form of energy-- a soul, an essence of being.

75
00:05:27,347 --> 00:05:30,291
And as we all know, energy cannot be destroyed.

76
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:35,514
So what happens to it when the soul's container is used up, stops working?

77
00:05:35,904 --> 00:05:40,009
Well, I'm exploring the idea that perhaps it lingers.

78
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:41,760
At least some of it, anyway.

79
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:46,737
And I think that there are people that can not only see this energy,

80
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:48,416
but can communicate with it.

81
00:05:49,185 --> 00:05:52,487
Now, when we identify people who seem to have this ability--

82
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:55,538
and they seem to exist all over the globe--

83
00:05:55,651 --> 00:05:58,717
we ask them to come to our lab so we can measure their accuracy.

84
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:03,966
Thank you so much. It was so great.

85
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:08,288
Oh, I'm so sorry. I haven't been getting any sleep.

86
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:10,975
You poor thing. You seeing anyone? 'Cause I can...

87
00:06:11,032 --> 00:06:13,591
Just a lot of late-night TV. It'll pass.

88
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,829
Hey, when are we going to get these two together again?

89
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:19,679
Have you guys been to Story Time at Burton's Books?

90
00:06:19,786 --> 00:06:20,708
No, we haven't.

91
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:22,756
It is so fun.

92
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:24,732
And it's great 'cause it's on Monday, when I don't have class.

93
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:27,933
They dress up and they read the kids stories,

94
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:30,502
and then they scream at you until you buy them the books.

95
00:06:30,574 --> 00:06:32,003
Oh, it sounds fun.

96
00:06:32,228 --> 00:06:33,498
Let's do it if I'm around.

97
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,482
- Okay.
- Okay.

98
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:35,992
- Bye, Ray.
- Say good-bye.

99
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:38,204
- Bye-bye.
- Bye now.

100
00:06:38,727 --> 00:06:42,960
No. I'm not walking up to a total stranger at a party, where anyone can hear, and say,

101
00:06:43,108 --> 00:06:45,827
"Hey, all that stuff you're talking about? I do all that stuff in my sleep.

102
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:48,986
And speaking of sleep? I'm having a little problem with a reocurring nightmare.

103
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:50,260
Could you maybe help with that?"

104
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,892
I wasn't saying you needed to talk to him right then and there.

105
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:54,331
I'm justst saying... if you're looking for help.

106
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:55,668
But I'm not looking for help.

107
00:06:55,739 --> 00:06:59,467
And I'm certainly not looking to be a rat in some academic's maze.

108
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:01,035
It's a dream.

109
00:07:01,726 --> 00:07:02,693
It'll pass.

110
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,330
Yes, you heard me correctly. I'd like to delay the press conference.

111
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,476
I don't know-- four hours?

112
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:14,095
Obviously, I have my reasons. Of course I have my reasons.

113
00:07:15,672 --> 00:07:18,365
No. Don't call back and tell me how much you can get me.

114
00:07:18,422 --> 00:07:21,191
Call me back and tell me you've gotten me four hours.

115
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,019
You feeling all right?

116
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:29,112
Oh, no, I'm okay. I'm just a little tired.

117
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:32,747
Well, I'm sorry to call at the last minute, but a situation came up over the weekend.

118
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:37,585
Do you remember reading about the killing of Councilman Miguel Garcia?

119
00:07:37,852 --> 00:07:40,621
Councilman in the ninth district. Grew up here, in fact.

120
00:07:40,848 --> 00:07:41,805
Great guy.

121
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:44,386
Gulf War vet. Got his MBA right here in Arizona.

122
00:07:45,086 --> 00:07:48,618
Comes home, runs for office. Wins, obviously.

123
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:52,730
The only thing is, his district is rife with corruption-- drugs, prostitution.

124
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:56,975
Anything past 5:30 at night and the streets are a war zone.

125
00:07:57,205 --> 00:08:00,431
But he takes over and really starts to put the lid on things.

126
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:04,051
People are starting to go out again at night, business is beginning to pick up.

127
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:08,152
Then last July, he's at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new 24-hour market,

128
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,098
which the neighborhood really needs.

129
00:08:10,262 --> 00:08:13,180
Around 9:30, he's getting into his car. Pop, pop.

130
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:15,495
Two shots to the back of the head.

131
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:17,036
Killer was sitting in the backseat.

132
00:08:17,118 --> 00:08:19,228
- Okay, now I remember this.
- Yeah.

133
00:08:19,677 --> 00:08:21,865
Whole district's been up in arms ever since.

134
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,974
They want someone to pay and we have nothing.

135
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:26,416
- Nothing?
- Well... next to nothing.

136
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:30,743
It has all the earmarks of an organized crime hit. But beyond that...

137
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:34,167
Then this weekend, the killer turned himself in.

138
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:37,567
Walked into the police with his attorney and confessed.

139
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,390
- Oh, my God, that's great.
- Yeah.

140
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,953
Only thing is...

141
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:42,585
he's 14.

142
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:47,577
Nothing would make my life easier than to hand over this kid's head on a silver platter,

143
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:48,755
but I just don't believe it.

144
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:51,530
I can't tell you why, but I just don't believe it.

145
00:08:51,817 --> 00:08:55,402
I was supposed to have a press conference in 20 minutes and announce that we had our man, but...

146
00:08:55,824 --> 00:08:57,976
he's sitting in the conference room with his lawyer.

147
00:08:58,043 --> 00:08:59,552
I asked for one more interview.

148
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:02,785
I'll introduce you as my assistant. You can't actually ask any questions,

149
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:05,549
but I'd be very curious to know what you think.

150
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:08,886
I stole the gun from my cousin.

151
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,456
He kept it in his car for protection.

152
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:13,783
When I was done, I put it back.

153
00:09:14,282 --> 00:09:15,723
Do you know where the gun is now?

154
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:18,846
I'm sorry. I need you to speak your answer.

155
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:21,518
No. My cousin's in prison.

156
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:23,797
I don't know what he did with the gun.

157
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:27,970
Okay. So... let's review.

158
00:09:28,578 --> 00:09:32,515
You knew who the councilman was. You heard that he was out to clean up the streets,

159
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:34,979
shut down the prostitution, the gambling, the drugs.

160
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:38,953
Your older brothers and your cousins all would say how he was making trouble for them,

161
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:43,074
so you got it into your head to take care of the problem yourself.

162
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:45,087
Nobody told you what to do.

163
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:48,864
Nobody put you up to it. It was your idea and you... did it.

164
00:09:50,645 --> 00:09:52,581
I need "yes" or "no."

165
00:09:53,724 --> 00:09:56,012
Yes. It was my idea.

166
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,500
Nobody told me to do it.

167
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:10,016
Well, it's like I told you on the phone. What brings me here is this dream.

168
00:10:10,865 --> 00:10:12,043
It's chronic.

169
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,921
All night, every night. I can't sleep, I can't function.

170
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,737
And now it's affecting my work.

171
00:10:17,896 --> 00:10:21,802
And that work, you claim it does make some use of your sensitivities?

172
00:10:21,884 --> 00:10:24,162
I told you I'm not allowed to discuss my work.

173
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:25,699
Mm-hm. I respect that.

174
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:30,035
A lot of the research mediums I study work with law enforcement and almost all have to agree

175
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,994
to some level of confidentiality in their work.

176
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,341
I'm going to assume that's the case with you, as well.

177
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,281
Now, if you don't mind I'd like to get some biographical data.

178
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:43,290
Again, Dr. Cardwell, I mean no disrespect.

179
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:45,841
I came here in the hopes that you could help me

180
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:48,118
or maybe point me towards someone who could.

181
00:10:48,744 --> 00:10:51,237
I honestly have no interest in being studied.

182
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,008
Now, these... what do you call them?

183
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,156
Sensitivities.

184
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:57,572
Sensitivities...are not something I ever would have chosen for myself.

185
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:01,118
They make the world a much darker place.

186
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,638
I really just want some sleep.

187
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,155
Well, as you well know, Mrs. Dubois, there are pills for that.

188
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,124
And you can get those from any doctor.

189
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:12,768
But if you really can do what you say you can do,

190
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:15,705
then there's a reason you dream the same dream every night.

191
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:20,883
And frankly, I'm probably the best person around to help you figure out what it is.

192
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,106
What do you mean?

193
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,455
Someone... living...

194
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:26,367
dead...

195
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:29,551
would seem to be sending you a message, but again,

196
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:33,196
none of it is relevant if you're not really who you say you are.

197
00:11:33,273 --> 00:11:37,548
So, if you'd be so good as to humor me for just a little while longer,

198
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:39,688
why don't we take a walk down to the lab?

199
00:11:41,127 --> 00:11:41,951
Circle?

200
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:44,419
Are you asking me or telling me?

201
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:46,534
It's a circle.

202
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:53,875
An octagon.

203
00:11:58,704 --> 00:11:59,759
A car.

204
00:12:07,282 --> 00:12:08,560
A rectangle.

205
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:13,260
How's this for a psychic contradiction?

206
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:15,693
I sense I'm doing really poorly at this.

207
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:18,395
Just concentrate on the card.

208
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:21,185
I'm too tired to concentrate, which is why I'm here.

209
00:12:21,345 --> 00:12:22,425
Do you want to stop?

210
00:12:25,638 --> 00:12:27,739
Just really focus now.

211
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:39,873
A train.

212
00:12:51,768 --> 00:12:52,899
Mrs. Dubois...

213
00:12:54,768 --> 00:12:55,618
Hurry!

214
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:59,407
Wait!

215
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:07,747
Allison?

216
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:09,626
Allison?

217
00:13:12,484 --> 00:13:16,579
I'm sorry. I just keep seeing these two boys running, running along the train track.

218
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:18,049
A train track?

219
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:20,559
Yes. And there's a train coming, a long, long train

220
00:13:20,595 --> 00:13:24,331
with a big "J" and a big "O" on it.

221
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:27,465
It's my dream. I have it over and over again.

222
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:28,807
Two boys.

223
00:13:29,047 --> 00:13:30,465
They're brothers, I think.

224
00:13:31,262 --> 00:13:32,679
One's a little older.

225
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,914
The younger one falls.

226
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:39,297
It doesn't really matter what card you hold up, that's all I see.

227
00:13:41,965 --> 00:13:42,779
What?

228
00:13:43,378 --> 00:13:47,002
When I was a boy growing up-- not far from here, actually--

229
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:51,596
my brother and I, we were out way past when we promised we'd be home,

230
00:13:51,662 --> 00:13:55,420
and to get home, you had to go over these railroad tracks.

231
00:13:55,596 --> 00:13:59,901
So, we're running as fast as we can, trying to get home before anybody notices,

232
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:04,351
and suddenly we realized, "Oh, no, the train's coming,"

233
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:08,820
and that train, it looked like it was five miles long.

234
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:11,942
If you didn't cross the tracks by the time the train went by,

235
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:13,960
you would be stuck there forever.

236
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:18,815
So we raced, me and Kenny, two years younger than me.

237
00:14:19,896 --> 00:14:22,070
He fell just before the tracks.

238
00:14:25,184 --> 00:14:27,400
Kenny. Kenny Cardwell.

239
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:29,351
What happened?

240
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,789
You know what happened.

241
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:36,048
The train passed, he was gone.

242
00:14:37,373 --> 00:14:39,403
A man came, took him.

243
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:40,747
Killed him.

244
00:14:41,383 --> 00:14:43,662
Killed three other children that summer, too,

245
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:46,580
but you know all that already, don't you?

246
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,352
No.

247
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:49,699
Really.

248
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,206
It's all right here.

249
00:15:02,816 --> 00:15:04,264
Who put you up to this?

250
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,578
Nobody put me up to anything.

251
00:15:06,968 --> 00:15:08,125
It's my dream.

252
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:11,171
I've been dreaming about these boys and this train.

253
00:15:11,418 --> 00:15:13,758
I guess I've been dreaming about you.

254
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:18,515
I would really appreciate it if you'd leave now.

255
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,996
I really don't know what to say.

256
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:57,959
...southeast Texas as well.

257
00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:05,229
Right now, you can see very heavy rain near the 610 Loop and I-10 on the east side of town,

258
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,615
but there's also some very heavy flooding...

259
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:10,727
Hey, I was watching that.

260
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,719
It's okay. You're supposed to be a psychic.

261
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,394
You shouldn't even need the Weather Channel.

262
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,646
It was a joke. You can laugh later.

263
00:16:18,315 --> 00:16:20,155
Look, the kids are going to be up in a couple of minutes.

264
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:22,275
Why don't you sneak back into the bedroom, while you still have a chance,

265
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:23,524
and try and get some sleep.

266
00:16:23,636 --> 00:16:25,469
I'll get them off to school. I'll tell them you're sick.

267
00:16:25,575 --> 00:16:27,516
No, no, no. I'm okay.

268
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:29,780
Beg to differ. Have you looked at your eyes lately?

269
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:31,407
Bad?

270
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:33,840
You should see them from my side.

271
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:39,094
You don't actually have to go into work today?

272
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,381
After I fell asleep the other day? No.

273
00:16:41,443 --> 00:16:45,033
In fact, I think they're revoking my clearance to get into the building.

274
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,853
Well, now the kids are up.

275
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,619
Who calls at 7:00 in the morning?

276
00:16:52,206 --> 00:16:52,902
Hello?

277
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,463
Yeah, just a minute.

278
00:16:57,376 --> 00:16:58,472
It's Dr. Cardwell.

279
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,035
Dr. Cardwell.

280
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:07,023
Mrs. Dubois. I-I appreciate you coming back.

281
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:08,781
Please.

282
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:18,565
When I had the opportunity to reflect on what you said-- how you described your dream--

283
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:23,289
I realized that you referenced the letters "J" and "O."

284
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:26,679
On the train. On the locomotive.

285
00:17:27,954 --> 00:17:30,083
Now, I went back and double-checked.

286
00:17:30,574 --> 00:17:34,739
I hadn't included that fact in my account of the incident.

287
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:36,443
It's nowhere in the book.

288
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:39,510
So, uh...

289
00:17:40,437 --> 00:17:42,244
I believe I owe you an apology.

290
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:44,216
You already apologized on the phone.

291
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,810
As I explained when we first met, what I really need...

292
00:17:48,363 --> 00:17:49,380
is some help.

293
00:17:50,743 --> 00:17:53,574
Actually, maybe we can help each other.

294
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:57,572
If you'd be willing, I'd love you to spend some time in the lab.

295
00:17:57,732 --> 00:18:02,781
I suspect that the more we study your dream, the clearer the message will become,

296
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:09,765
and my hunch is that once that code is broken, the dream will abate.

297
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:11,331
And how can I help you?

298
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:16,267
Well... I keep thinking...

299
00:18:17,894 --> 00:18:21,781
perhaps it's not an accident that we met at that party,

300
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:23,911
that you're having this dream.

301
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,934
Whatever its message, I can't help but wonder

302
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:31,411
if it's coming from my little brother.

303
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,289
Look, the mayor's asking a lot of questions-- questions that I can't answer--

304
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:44,274
the most important being, "Why isn't this kid being hauled off in a jumpsuit yet?"

305
00:18:44,345 --> 00:18:46,542
I just want to make sure we have everything we need.

306
00:18:46,614 --> 00:18:49,425
Everything we need? We have a confession. What else could we possibly need?

307
00:18:49,491 --> 00:18:51,882
I just think there might be more to it, that's all.

308
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:53,689
Well, you're wrong. There is no more to it.

309
00:18:53,762 --> 00:18:56,394
He did a bad thing. People are angry. Now we need to put him away.

310
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:58,896
Tell the mayor I get the message.

311
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:02,745
I just want to make sure all our ducks are in a row and I need a little more time.

312
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,738
- How much?
- A couple of days.

313
00:19:05,951 --> 00:19:08,921
I don't know if you've noticed, but it's pouring outside.

314
00:19:09,075 --> 00:19:11,645
I mention that because the mayor thinks of you as family.

315
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:14,333
The mayor thinks of you as someone under his umbrella.

316
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:16,130
Don't take too much time.

317
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,056
We'd all hate to see you get wet.

318
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:24,937
I don't know what else to tell you.

319
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:28,858
It's big. It's a train.

320
00:19:30,072 --> 00:19:32,364
These boys are running down a dirt road.

321
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,414
Open your eyes.

322
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:36,365
A... A dirt road?

323
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:39,268
- You're certain.
- Yeah. An old dirt road. Why?

324
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,979
We grew up in Winslow.

325
00:19:41,157 --> 00:19:43,974
It wasn't a metropolis, but the roads were paved.

326
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,365
What about the time of day?

327
00:19:49,652 --> 00:19:52,662
Just day. I don't know what time it is.

328
00:19:53,128 --> 00:19:55,550
The sun's out. It's daytime.

329
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:58,954
It was dusk when Kenny and I raced home.

330
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:03,097
It was the end of a long summer day. I remember because

331
00:20:03,195 --> 00:20:08,089
it was getting harder and harder to see. I always thought maybe that's why he tripped and fell.

332
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,994
You know, if this is a message of some kind, if this is coming from your brother--

333
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:16,389
he was, what, five or six when it happened?

334
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:20,406
Maybe he doesn't remember the time of day.

335
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:23,526
Maybe he actually remembers a dirt road.

336
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,229
Maybe. I don't know.

337
00:20:29,342 --> 00:20:32,732
There are certain days-- the birth of your children, your wedding day--

338
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:34,657
they're just burned into your head.

339
00:20:37,673 --> 00:20:40,919
The day I lost my brother-- the day my brother died--

340
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:47,072
I can tell you the shade of green the grass was under our feet as we ran.

341
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:53,975
I still remember the smell of my pillowcase. I cried into it for three days.

342
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,997
I remember...

343
00:20:58,405 --> 00:20:59,382
everything.

344
00:21:01,404 --> 00:21:03,304
Whenever I go to a funeral,

345
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,380
I see the deceased.

346
00:21:07,368 --> 00:21:09,233
They seem to seek me out.

347
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:14,107
Would you like me to visit your brother's grave?

348
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:18,608
There is no grave.

349
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,181
There was no body.

350
00:21:21,162 --> 00:21:25,136
Three other kids disappeared that summer in that area.

351
00:21:26,543 --> 00:21:29,252
They finally caught the man who did it, just before Halloween.

352
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:34,295
I remember hearing how the father of one of the other little boys shot him

353
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:37,705
just as he was being transferred from the courthouse to the jail.

354
00:21:38,053 --> 00:21:39,512
Never did confess.

355
00:21:39,988 --> 00:21:42,806
Never did tell anyone where the bodies were.

356
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,872
Can I ask you to do one more thing?

357
00:21:52,753 --> 00:21:54,520
These things belonged to my brother.

358
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,785
I was wondering maybe you could just go through them.

359
00:21:57,837 --> 00:21:59,231
See if anything comes to you.

360
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:02,400
- Maybe Kenny... 
- Will communicate with me?

361
00:22:05,594 --> 00:22:09,235
I've given this box to a number of people over the years.

362
00:22:09,343 --> 00:22:10,719
Has anyone ever gotten any...?

363
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,904
Did you or your brother have a nickname?

364
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,257
Like?

365
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:27,790
Like... Buckles...

366
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:31,574
or Bucky or, or, Buckley something?

367
00:22:34,318 --> 00:22:36,469
You know what? I'm sorry I even mentioned it.

368
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:37,553
I'm exhausted.

369
00:22:38,838 --> 00:22:41,081
Is there any way I could take these things with me,

370
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:43,820
try and get some rest and maybe try again later?

371
00:22:44,984 --> 00:22:45,771
Sure.

372
00:22:46,606 --> 00:22:49,617
Just got a call back from the Department of Motor Vehicles. You were right.

373
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:54,593
Chavo Galindo's family just registered a new car valued at over $35,000.

374
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:57,788
And from what we can tell, the car wasn't financed.

375
00:22:57,896 --> 00:23:00,112
- You're saying they paid cash.
- Seems that way.

376
00:23:00,404 --> 00:23:02,489
Hm. New car, expensive defense attorney.

377
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,669
Must be pretty lucrative, confessing to murder.

378
00:23:04,736 --> 00:23:07,086
But why would anyone do that, even for all the money in the world?

379
00:23:07,214 --> 00:23:11,321
Hey, you're 14 and poor and someone staring at life in prison

380
00:23:11,382 --> 00:23:14,454
offers you and your family more money than they ever dreamed of?

381
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,230
And what are you looking at, four, five years in juvenile prison?

382
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,344
You come out, you're a wealthy kid.

383
00:23:22,425 --> 00:23:24,239
You've got important friends in the neighborhood.

384
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:27,393
Starts to look like a career path, doesn't it?

385
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:36,634
Come on, you plastic, non-commissioned, little bastard.

386
00:23:37,453 --> 00:23:38,748
How long are you going to do that?

387
00:23:38,928 --> 00:23:40,412
Until I get something.

388
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,490
What if you don't get anything?

389
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:43,658
I'll get something.

390
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,594
I have to get something.

391
00:23:47,617 --> 00:23:48,967
I'm not getting anything.

392
00:23:49,214 --> 00:23:50,813
Allison, it's the weekend.

393
00:23:51,273 --> 00:23:54,574
It's been raining for a day and a half. The girls are going out of their minds.

394
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:57,094
How about we take them to the movies?

395
00:23:57,632 --> 00:23:58,436
Now?

396
00:23:58,589 --> 00:24:01,620
Come on. I can't handle the three of them by myself. What do you say?

397
00:24:01,906 --> 00:24:05,658
You've been staring at Action Figure Andy and "Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots" all day.

398
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,373
When we get back, you can stare at them some more.

399
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:16,078
- Stop that.
- What?

400
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:19,391
The movie hasn't even started yet and you're already sneaking looks at your watch.

401
00:24:36,195 --> 00:24:39,118
It was supposed to be a search for their mother.

402
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:40,563
We're almost there.

403
00:24:41,383 --> 00:24:42,534
I can't make it!

404
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:44,209
Shut up and run!

405
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:45,406
Am I awake?

406
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:47,383
What are you talking about? Of course you're awake.

407
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:52,799
But this summer, Nate and David Carmichael will find much more than they bargained for.

408
00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:53,634
Damn.

409
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:07,346
Hey.

410
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:08,415
Hi.

411
00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:10,786
What you doing?

412
00:25:11,401 --> 00:25:12,757
Just watching you.

413
00:25:13,177 --> 00:25:17,023
What's the matter? They all out of weather on Channel 77?

414
00:25:18,277 --> 00:25:19,435
Couldn't sleep.

415
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:23,203
3:17-- what a shock.

416
00:25:24,442 --> 00:25:25,215
The train?

417
00:25:25,532 --> 00:25:28,870
That, and I keep hearing Cardwell's voice when I called him on the phone

418
00:25:28,937 --> 00:25:30,831
to tell him about the coming attraction.

419
00:25:31,313 --> 00:25:32,325
How'd he take it?

420
00:25:33,262 --> 00:25:35,967
You know, he's a scientist. You know how they are.

421
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:39,038
Mm. Just a bundle of emotion, huh?

422
00:25:39,966 --> 00:25:41,239
Very logical.

423
00:25:42,202 --> 00:25:43,514
I should have known.

424
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:47,948
Then he reminded me of all the inconsistencies between my dream and his memories.

425
00:25:48,158 --> 00:25:49,473
Damn scientists.

426
00:25:50,431 --> 00:25:51,414
Damn logic.

427
00:25:52,172 --> 00:25:55,219
But I could sense his sadness, his disappointment.

428
00:25:57,052 --> 00:26:00,360
I like to believe these things come to me for a reason.

429
00:26:01,563 --> 00:26:04,516
That there's a meaning and a purpose to all of it.

430
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:07,062
But maybe that's just ego.

431
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:09,632
Maybe it's all random.

432
00:26:10,711 --> 00:26:13,584
I dreamed a movie's coming attraction.

433
00:26:14,757 --> 00:26:16,584
And maybe that's all it is,

434
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:19,446
is a movie's coming attraction.

435
00:26:26,506 --> 00:26:28,847
I'm happy to bargain, I'm happy to be flexible.

436
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:31,078
What I'm not happy to be is taken advantage of.

437
00:26:31,735 --> 00:26:36,419
Well, remind your client that the luxury yacht market in Arizona is limited at best,

438
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:40,054
and if this drags on any longer, I might just lose my yen for buying his boat.

439
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:44,719
I'm sorry, I have to go now. Just think about what I said.

440
00:26:45,697 --> 00:26:46,551
Manuel.

441
00:26:47,361 --> 00:26:48,098
Nyles.

442
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:51,165
I'm happy for you-- you and the mayor.

443
00:26:51,237 --> 00:26:53,107
Putting this messy business to bed.

444
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,054
I meant to ask you the other day-- how does an expensive piece of manpower like you

445
00:26:57,109 --> 00:27:00,306
come to represent a fatherless boy whose mother makes $11 an hour?

446
00:27:00,611 --> 00:27:02,249
This is America, Manny.

447
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:04,671
Everyone is entitled to a vigorous defense.

448
00:27:05,121 --> 00:27:07,739
And I live here, too. I care about my community.

449
00:27:07,897 --> 00:27:08,839
I'm sure you do.

450
00:27:10,304 --> 00:27:11,526
It's 3:30.

451
00:27:12,004 --> 00:27:15,915
Those news trucks out there are going to want to hear from us before Oprah signs off.

452
00:27:16,023 --> 00:27:17,477
- Let's talk numbers?
- Absolutely.

453
00:27:18,358 --> 00:27:20,655
Obviously, we're looking for what you're looking for.

454
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,036
That's why we're here. That's why we confessed.

455
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,346
No trial, no muss, no fuss.

456
00:27:25,914 --> 00:27:30,036
We're thinking four years in a juvenile institution, no probation

457
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:32,831
and you expunge the charges when he's released.

458
00:27:34,629 --> 00:27:36,769
You've met the boy. He's got a clean record.

459
00:27:36,846 --> 00:27:39,186
Some dubious relatives, but a clean record.

460
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:41,429
I truly believe this is aberrant behavior,

461
00:27:41,516 --> 00:27:44,372
and I truly believe this is the appropriate punishment.

462
00:27:45,854 --> 00:27:48,397
So, can we put this to bed?

463
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:51,468
I'll certainly think about it.

464
00:27:52,918 --> 00:27:53,901
Excuse me?

465
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:58,738
Your client confessed to the cold-blooded murder of a pillar of the community.

466
00:27:58,775 --> 00:28:00,674
I think that warrants some thought.

467
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,206
I'll be in touch.

468
00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:07,818
You wanted to see me?

469
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,096
Yes. Thanks for stopping by.

470
00:28:10,197 --> 00:28:12,906
No. I'm glad you called. I felt very badly about last week.

471
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:16,085
- Obviously you were feeling ill... 
- I haven't been sleeping and...

472
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:20,279
- You first.
- No... just...

473
00:28:20,893 --> 00:28:24,800
Look, I could have used your help, yes, but at that moment, for whatever reason,

474
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:27,095
you didn't have help to give me. I understand.

475
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,872
But I'm hoping today will be different.

476
00:28:31,983 --> 00:28:32,951
What are these?

477
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,885
I have reason to believe that one of these four men may be the one who's bankrolling

478
00:28:37,002 --> 00:28:41,139
14-year-old Chavo Galindo's defense and siphoning money to his family.

479
00:28:41,297 --> 00:28:45,357
It doesn't seem unreasonable to suppose that whoever's spending hundreds of thousands of dollars

480
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:50,670
to implicate this boy probably had a hand in the killing of Councilman Miguel Garcia.

481
00:28:50,739 --> 00:28:53,636
- And you were hoping...?
- That you might be able to tell me...

482
00:28:53,703 --> 00:28:54,916
From these pictures?

483
00:28:57,011 --> 00:28:59,505
I gotta tell you, I'm still not at my best.

484
00:28:59,663 --> 00:29:01,763
The sleeping thing I was telling you about,

485
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:05,617
and for some reason whenever I close my eyes I see this movie train.

486
00:29:05,689 --> 00:29:07,648
So you're not getting anything?

487
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,370
No. I'm sorry.

488
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,370
Oh, well... It's okay.

489
00:29:12,842 --> 00:29:15,771
At the end of the day, all I would've been doing is adding your hunch to my own,

490
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:19,236
and it would take a lot more than a couple of hunches to stop this juggernaut.

491
00:29:19,702 --> 00:29:24,091
Can I hold on to these? Who knows, maybe tonight everything will break open, and...

492
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:25,150
Of course.

493
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,771
So what does the rest of the day hold for you?

494
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,682
Gee, it looks like I could still make story time.

495
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,859
Nice.

496
00:29:34,971 --> 00:29:35,703
Well...

497
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:37,582
wish me luck.

498
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,126
I feel a press conference coming on.

499
00:29:43,705 --> 00:29:47,679
"Grizz Brickbottom was the toughest cowboy ever

500
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:51,401
to drive a herd of cattle across the open range.

501
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:57,760
Grizz was so tough he could drink a quart of Tabasco sauce a day."

502
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:01,626
This is a great idea. Marie's loving this.

503
00:30:01,703 --> 00:30:04,273
I know. This is one of Jason's favorite things, too.

504
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:10,738
You know, I can just see it now. I'm going to be buying cowboy stuff for the next year and a half.

505
00:30:10,826 --> 00:30:12,798
Not us. We'll be buying ponies.

506
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:13,940
Ponies.

507
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:21,282
"Based on a novel by Ken Buckley."

508
00:30:21,456 --> 00:30:23,074
Buckley? Buckley?

509
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:26,847
Kamala, can you excuse me a second?

510
00:30:26,935 --> 00:30:27,508
Yeah.

511
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:31,199
Okay, let's look at this...

512
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:36,067
"Based on a novel by Ken Buckley."

513
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:44,722
"Ken Buckley was born in 1964 "and still lives in rural Holbrook, Arizona,

514
00:30:44,782 --> 00:30:47,768
not far from the railroad tracks, where he grew up hearing the stories

515
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:52,124
of the lives forever altered by the mighty locomotives that would pass through his town."

516
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:54,167
Ken Buckley...

517
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,291
Kenny Cardwell.

518
00:31:11,224 --> 00:31:12,144
What you doing?

519
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:13,961
Looking up something on the map.

520
00:31:14,862 --> 00:31:16,163
Making a break for it, huh?

521
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:20,259
No matter where you go, Allison, I will find you.

522
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:23,817
Holbrook. Where Ken Buckley lives.

523
00:31:24,032 --> 00:31:25,952
Looks to be about 70 miles away.

524
00:31:26,357 --> 00:31:27,042
So?

525
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,740
So I'm going to drive there tomorrow.

526
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,468
You mean today.

527
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:34,729
After I take the kids to school and drop Marie off at day care.

528
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:40,862
See if maybe I can talk to Ken Buckley. See if there's any way possible he's Kenny Cardwell.

529
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:43,546
Remember what that doctor said about my dream?

530
00:31:43,622 --> 00:31:46,781
That the dream would abate the more I understood its message.

531
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,021
Well, the funny thing is, after I saw the coming attraction,

532
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:55,332
as disappointing as it was for Dr. Cardwell, it kind of helped my sleeping.

533
00:31:55,444 --> 00:31:57,344
Really? It's 4:00 in the morning.

534
00:31:57,431 --> 00:31:58,332
Exactly.

535
00:31:58,735 --> 00:32:00,359
And I slept over four hours.

536
00:32:00,831 --> 00:32:03,161
I only had the train dream three times.

537
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,434
It's not perfect yet, but it's getting better.

538
00:32:05,705 --> 00:32:07,286
I feel like I'm getting closer.

539
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:11,301
Is that the best you can do, "Wha...?"

540
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,408
What do you want me to say? It's 4:00 in the morning.

541
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,846
I don't know-- good luck.

542
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:19,140
I mean, think about it. What's the downside?

543
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:22,039
So, I knock on this guy's door. So, he opens it.

544
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,104
And he's black or he's really young or he's really old or he isn't even there

545
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,930
'cause he moved to California to be closer to his seven brothers and sisters,

546
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:30,737
who he's been close to all his life.

547
00:32:30,856 --> 00:32:33,646
And I say, "I'm sorry, my mistake."

548
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,231
But at least I'm doing something.

549
00:32:36,514 --> 00:32:39,691
At least I'm chasing the train and the train's not chasing me.

550
00:32:39,795 --> 00:32:40,629
You know what?

551
00:32:40,983 --> 00:32:41,720
Good luck.

552
00:32:42,913 --> 00:32:43,727
Thank you.

553
00:32:45,284 --> 00:32:47,065
Come on, you know it's 4:00 in the morning?

554
00:32:47,172 --> 00:32:48,135
We should be in bed.

555
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:58,965
Morning.

556
00:32:59,287 --> 00:33:00,060
Morning.

557
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:03,383
I'm looking for Ken Buckley.

558
00:33:03,925 --> 00:33:05,728
He's not here right now.

559
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:07,400
He'll be back soon.

560
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:09,864
But he's not here right now.

561
00:33:10,996 --> 00:33:13,981
Okay, maybe I'll go get a cup of coffee and I'll come back.

562
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:22,583
I know you're tired.

563
00:33:22,763 --> 00:33:24,718
I know you haven't slept.

564
00:33:25,522 --> 00:33:28,788
And I'm sorry I haunted your dreams.

565
00:33:29,694 --> 00:33:33,217
But I haven't slept in almost 20 years.

566
00:33:34,002 --> 00:33:41,210
For 20 years, I stood outside the gates of Heaven feeling nothing

567
00:33:42,275 --> 00:33:45,869
but the heat of hell beneath me,

568
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:48,192
calling me home.

569
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:53,487
I know I'm a bad person.

570
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:56,456
I know I've done bad things.

571
00:33:57,173 --> 00:33:59,258
But I need to put this to rest.

572
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:01,982
I need your help.

573
00:34:10,857 --> 00:34:14,100
Mr. District Attorney, I was starting to think you'd forgotten about us.

574
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,295
Oh, I'm a lot of things, but forgetful isn't one of them.

575
00:34:17,373 --> 00:34:18,692
Please, have a seat.

576
00:34:24,224 --> 00:34:25,697
- So.
- So.

577
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:28,268
I've given your client's situation a great deal of thought.

578
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:30,244
- I'm sure.
- And here's what I'd like to propose.

579
00:34:30,761 --> 00:34:33,501
16 years. Arizona State Correctional Facility.

580
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:36,051
That, of course, assumes that your client stands by his confession

581
00:34:36,111 --> 00:34:37,971
and the state avoids the expense of a trial.

582
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:38,912
But I...

583
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:43,465
With all due respect, Manuel, that is not a deal.

584
00:34:43,566 --> 00:34:45,743
- That is a maximum sentence.
- No.

585
00:34:46,203 --> 00:34:49,388
The maximum sentence for murder one is death by injection.

586
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,881
The more likely sentence is life in prison.

587
00:34:52,261 --> 00:34:55,286
And that's what I'm guessing he'll get if we try him as an adult,

588
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:56,699
which we're prepared to do.

589
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,778
At least, this way, he gets out when he's 30.

590
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,753
It's not nearly as bad as it sounds.

591
00:35:01,906 --> 00:35:03,432
They say it's the new 20.

592
00:35:03,616 --> 00:35:05,003
But he's confessed.

593
00:35:05,193 --> 00:35:07,252
Yes, he did. And in great detail.

594
00:35:07,303 --> 00:35:10,620
Which is the only reason I'm even entertaining this generous deal I'm proposing.

595
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:13,415
Come on, Chavo.

596
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:14,982
Think about it.

597
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,793
Whatever you're getting for this, is it worth what you're going get for this?

598
00:35:19,038 --> 00:35:20,006
Who was it?

599
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:23,515
- It w...
- Who was who?

600
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,804
District Attorney Devalos, I really do need you to address all your questions to me.

601
00:35:27,896 --> 00:35:31,147
- I did this on my own.
- Do... not... speak!

602
00:35:35,771 --> 00:35:37,327
Is that your final offer?

603
00:35:37,424 --> 00:35:38,821
It's my only offer.

604
00:35:39,548 --> 00:35:43,363
And in my opinion, if you're interested in doing what's best for your client, you'll accept it.

605
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:47,197
I'm sorry, son, but taking the rap for murder is not,

606
00:35:47,264 --> 00:35:50,024
nor will it ever be, a career opportunity in the city of Phoenix.

607
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:55,108
If you decide to rethink your confession, your attorney has my number.

608
00:36:02,798 --> 00:36:04,013
Mr. Buckley?

609
00:36:05,682 --> 00:36:06,566
Can I help you?

610
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,436
I don't know. I'm actually here on behalf of your mother,

611
00:36:09,521 --> 00:36:11,421
or the woman who brought you up, I mean.

612
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:13,480
I'm sure you're mistaken.

613
00:36:13,644 --> 00:36:15,747
My mother, the woman who brought me up,

614
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:18,001
she's been dead for quite sometime now.

615
00:36:18,098 --> 00:36:21,759
Since 1985. I know. I'm also here on behalf of your brother.

616
00:36:22,987 --> 00:36:28,569
Ma'am, I don't know who you are or what you want, but I don't have a brother.

617
00:36:28,661 --> 00:36:31,286
Well, yeah, you do and you wrote about him in your book.

618
00:36:34,283 --> 00:36:35,009
Ken?

619
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:38,444
Does the name "Cardwell" ring a bell?

620
00:36:41,651 --> 00:36:42,484
Does it?

621
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:44,696
No.

622
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:49,049
I don't know. Maybe.

623
00:36:51,185 --> 00:36:52,479
Tell me that name again.

624
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,956
It was a story my mom told me all the time about two boys running.

625
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:03,228
The youngest one falls just before he reaches the tracks and a kind woman finds him...

626
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:05,958
Mr. Buckley, that story is your story.

627
00:37:06,082 --> 00:37:07,379
I don't know what you mean.

628
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,784
Connie Buckley, the woman who raised you...

629
00:37:11,484 --> 00:37:12,382
My mother.

630
00:37:13,882 --> 00:37:16,734
Her son, the one she gave birth to,

631
00:37:16,896 --> 00:37:19,678
died of scarlet fever when he was seven months old.

632
00:37:19,979 --> 00:37:21,659
His death devastated her.

633
00:37:21,736 --> 00:37:24,726
She became despondent and morose, her husband left her.

634
00:37:24,854 --> 00:37:27,362
My father died when I was a baby.

635
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,324
Then, one day, she got a gift.

636
00:37:30,066 --> 00:37:32,002
The gift was a little boy.

637
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,867
And unlike the boy in your story or the movie they made from it,

638
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,993
he was barely four years old.

639
00:37:38,796 --> 00:37:40,111
She took you home...

640
00:37:40,981 --> 00:37:42,682
just for dinner at first.

641
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:45,994
Then she decided that you were hers to keep.

642
00:37:46,727 --> 00:37:49,579
As luck would have it, you came into her life during a summer

643
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,911
where three other children met a far less pleasant fate

644
00:37:52,993 --> 00:37:55,937
at the hands of someone even more twisted than Connie.

645
00:37:56,505 --> 00:38:00,079
The two of you lived in Nevada for two years, then you moved back here.

646
00:38:00,203 --> 00:38:02,081
She told you she was your mother.

647
00:38:02,174 --> 00:38:05,077
Every day she'd tell you, every day you'd cry.

648
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,795
Until one day, you just didn't cry anymore.

649
00:38:11,743 --> 00:38:15,518
This brother of mine you say you're working for...

650
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,236
He'd very much like to meet you.

651
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,881
Everything that I've told you is a matter of public record--

652
00:38:21,998 --> 00:38:25,466
the death of Connie's son, all the stories from when you went missing.

653
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,392
I know it's a lot to digest.

654
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:31,379
When you're ready...

655
00:38:33,503 --> 00:38:34,353
call.

656
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:39,581
Oh, and by the way...

657
00:38:40,477 --> 00:38:42,862
Connie Buckley, the woman who raised you?

658
00:38:43,302 --> 00:38:46,145
She wanted you to know that she truly loved you.

659
00:38:46,728 --> 00:38:48,628
And she's truly sorry.

660
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,346
Allison?

661
00:39:04,234 --> 00:39:05,104
Allison?

662
00:39:05,406 --> 00:39:07,284
Hey, babe, it's 7:30.

663
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,277
You overslept.

664
00:39:09,964 --> 00:39:12,359
Oh, my God, I slept through the night.

665
00:39:12,492 --> 00:39:14,581
And did we, perchance, dream of trains?

666
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:18,646
- Not once.
- Planes, buses? Any form of transit?

667
00:39:19,513 --> 00:39:21,919
Cool. I could use a hand. Marie wet her bed.

668
00:39:31,673 --> 00:39:32,614
Kenny?

669
00:39:45,379 --> 00:39:47,365
Can you ever forgive me?

670
00:39:47,847 --> 00:39:49,393
What are you talking about?

671
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,118
I tripped, man.

672
00:39:51,615 --> 00:39:52,886
I tripped.

673
00:39:54,942 --> 00:39:56,627
I am so sorry.

674
00:40:04,672 --> 00:40:06,218
You got another dollar I could borrow?

675
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:07,089
No.

676
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:09,914
Wait a minute, what time is it?

677
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,311
Uh, 9:35.

678
00:40:12,561 --> 00:40:13,411
Damn.

679
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:16,976
This guy made me promise I'd be where no one could see me by 9:00.

680
00:40:17,073 --> 00:40:18,147
We gotta go, man.

681
00:40:50,518 --> 00:40:51,193
Hello.

682
00:40:51,264 --> 00:40:54,719
So sorry to call in the middle of the night, but suddenly it all became clear.

683
00:40:54,812 --> 00:40:57,352
Slow down, Allison. Start at the beginning.

684
00:40:57,429 --> 00:40:58,678
Okay. Sorry.

685
00:40:58,964 --> 00:41:03,408
I'm sorry, it's just... it's just, I just had a dream about your 14-year-old murderer.

686
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,122
I saw where he was when he was supposed to be killing the councilman.

687
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,955
He was at a video arcade.

688
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:10,269
And not only that, but there was a security camera.

689
00:41:10,397 --> 00:41:13,418
and I'm betting that if we look at the security tapes of the day in question

690
00:41:13,495 --> 00:41:15,270
- and look at the time stamp...
- Allison.

691
00:41:16,269 --> 00:41:20,816
We sent Chavo to a medium security facility, pending trial, two days ago.

692
00:41:21,877 --> 00:41:26,208
His first night there, he was stabbed to death by an inmate who wanted his toothbrush.

693
00:41:30,558 --> 00:41:31,702
Allison?

694
00:41:35,046 --> 00:41:36,014
You okay?

695
00:41:37,437 --> 00:41:38,420
Yeah.

696
00:41:40,902 --> 00:41:43,160
Sure. I guess so.

697
00:41:47,626 --> 00:41:51,737
Listen, I'm going to go back to sleep.

698
00:41:53,406 --> 00:41:54,358
How about you?

699
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:56,954
I don't know.

700
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:00,952
Maybe.

701
00:42:02,597 --> 00:42:03,768
Maybe not.

702
00:42:05,054 --> 00:42:07,229
