00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey, guys. Let's take these seats back here. 

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,740
Then we can make a quick exit. 

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,460
Joe, come on. Hey, guys. 

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,430
Joe, not in front. 

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,070
Can I help you, mrs. Dubois?

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,060
Uh, I don't think so. 

8
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,230
Oh, I didn't realize that so one had passed away. 

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,900
I'm not really fond of funerals. 
I deal with death a lot in my work. 

10
00:00:31,955 --> 00:00:32,930
Me, too. 

11
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:38,325
Truth be told, these things are really more
for the family than for the deceased. 

12
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:40,317
I suppose so. You're right. 

13
00:00:40,682 --> 00:00:43,673
Gives everyone a sense of closure, 
an opportunity to say good-bye, 

14
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,432
creates an atmosphere of civility and control

15
00:00:46,508 --> 00:00:47,801
i think people find comforting

16
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:52,363
when faced with the sudden
and sometimes random reality of death. 

17
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:53,902
So. 

18
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:55,900
Here we are

19
00:01:07,255 --> 00:01:12,141
I think...  now would be an excellent time
for you to take your place, allison.

22
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:24,111
Do we have a current will?

23
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:28,342
You know, a will. For when people die. 

24
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,710
Suddenly it's becoming very clear. 

25
00:02:38,748 --> 00:02:40,653
The sleep deprivation. 

26
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,552
You're trying to kill me. 

27
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:44,893
I'm serious. 

28
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:49,183
okay. Let me put your mind at ease. 

29
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,011
We have a current will. 

30
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,850
We also have a mortgage. 

31
00:02:53,898 --> 00:02:55,542
We also have a mound of debt. 

32
00:02:56,277 --> 00:03:00,732
And should I die before you, 
all that becomes yours. 

33
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:02,580
What about the kids?

34
00:03:02,728 --> 00:03:04,050
I'll throw them in as well. 

35
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,511
But...  what if it's me?

36
00:03:07,247 --> 00:03:08,791
What if I go first?

37
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:10,842
Allison, stop it. 

38
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,750
You're not going anywhere. 

39
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:13,822
How do you know?

40
00:03:15,017 --> 00:03:15,603
All right. 

41
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:18,452
You win. I'll play. 

42
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:20,761
I don't know. 

43
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:22,853
You feel better?

44
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:23,662
I don'T. 

45
00:03:24,558 --> 00:03:27,953
And for what it's worth, 
I'm not enjoying this conversation. 

46
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:30,532
Why are you mad?

47
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:31,132
I don't know. 

48
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:34,251
Cause I think maybe conversations like
this are a waste of time. 

49
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:36,122
We have a will, we have some insurance. 

50
00:03:36,446 --> 00:03:38,322
We have kids we have to get up and go to school. 

51
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:40,810
No, I'm just being silly. 

52
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:43,012
No, you're not silly, but, just...  

53
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:45,872
don't you think if it was really your time to go, 

54
00:03:46,347 --> 00:03:49,142
that maybe you'd get some kind of
a heads up from the universe?

55
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:50,491
Like what?

56
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:52,391
I don't know. A dream. 

57
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:56,883
can I get a cell phone?

58
00:03:57,535 --> 00:03:59,041
No. Why not?

59
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:01,631
Because they're very expensive. 

60
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,360
They're not allowed in school. 

61
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:05,693
And besides, who are you going to call?

62
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,260
She could call me. 

63
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:08,642
Bridge. 

64
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:10,980
Well, then, can I get a pager?

65
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:15,433
No. Also expensive, also not allowed. 

66
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:18,081
And who are you going to page?

67
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:21,051
I don't know, but can I at least
get a computer in my room?

68
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:25,202
You're batting three for three, sweetie. 

69
00:04:26,305 --> 00:04:28,523
Well, you asked me what i wanted for my birthday. 

70
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:30,103
Ask for a trampoline. 

71
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:31,893
How about a watch?

72
00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:33,432
You're gonna be 13. 

73
00:04:33,535 --> 00:04:35,152
Couldn't you use a nice, pretty watch?

74
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:38,020
Maybe, but if I had a phone, 
I wouldn't need a watch. 

75
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,672
What about the computer right here?

76
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:44,301
Okay, fine. Can I at least
get my own private e-mail?

77
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:47,533
I think that's something  we can talk about...  

78
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:53,493
...  tonight or tomorrow, maybe next week. 

79
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:56,072
Look at that. Time to get ready for school. 

80
00:04:56,765 --> 00:04:58,832
Darn, these things are handy. 

81
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,902
There's a woman in the conference room
with detective scanlon, a mrs. Sondra bannister. 

82
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:06,342
Her husband, dean, is an oncologist   at mariposa memorial. 

83
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:09,861
Hasn't been seen since he left the hospital
yesterday evening around 6:00

84
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:15,032
ok, but don't we usually insist that people wait at
least 24 hours before filing a missing persons report?

85
00:05:15,086 --> 00:05:18,073
Well,  usually, the people doing the filing
aren't related to a sitting judge. 

86
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:21,523
Sondra is the daughter of
the honorable henry minder. 

87
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:24,903
I know you think i'm being premature, but...  

88
00:05:25,787 --> 00:05:27,103
dean is a creature of habit

89
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:30,811
and he is compulsive about
keeping his appointments

90
00:05:30,926 --> 00:05:32,772
He's already missed two patients this morning. 

91
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:36,172
It's just...  it's-it's not like him
to-to not come home

92
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:40,762
To not call, not call me, not call the office. 

93
00:05:41,086 --> 00:05:44,610
Let's begin at the beginning. 
He left the hospital at 6:00 A. M. 

94
00:05:45,237 --> 00:05:50,510
He has a standing racquetball game at the club, 
every tuesday night for about a year now. 

95
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:51,890
Who with?

96
00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:04,730
Detective scanlon will call the club and figure out  where he was supposed to be, 

97
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:06,083
who he was supposed to be with. 

98
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:10,332
Does your husband have a medical condition?

99
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:12,873
Is it possible he could  be incapacitated somewhere?

100
00:06:13,276 --> 00:06:14,901
Not  that I'm aware of. 

101
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:18,571
he's a doctor. I would konw

102
00:06:22,586 --> 00:06:24,602
No, this is all wrong. 

103
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,291
Something'shappened to him. 

104
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:32,991
Dr. Bannister. Ready to do a little business?

105
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:37,291
The angel of death. 

106
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:39,343
Well, he didn't say that. 

107
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,281
He didn't actually announce himself. 

108
00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:45,221
But I know that's what he stands for, I know that's what he represents. 

109
00:06:46,357 --> 00:06:48,191
And you know this...  how?

110
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:51,981
Well,  I've seen him before in my dreams.  This is not the first time. 

111
00:06:52,085 --> 00:06:53,002
I see. 

112
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:59,002
And these prior appearances have all   preceded the discovery of someone who perished?

113
00:07:01,637 --> 00:07:02,772
Allison...  

114
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:06,532
the man's been out of touch less than a day, 

115
00:07:06,737 --> 00:07:09,412
and while I have enormous respect   for your intuition--

116
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:11,293
I am the one who asked you to be in that meeting--

117
00:07:12,248 --> 00:07:14,091
I'd prefer not to jump the gun here. 

118
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:18,500
sorry to interrupt, but I thought you  might want to hear this. 

119
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:22,823
When I got back to my desk there was a message  waiting  from commerce general bank. 

120
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:25,032
Still no action on the good doctor's credit cards, 

121
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:29,930
but they did run a quick check on this   other finances and discovered something a bit unusual. 

122
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:31,723
For instance?

123
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:33,153
No withdrawals, 

124
00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:37,073
but a lot of cash deposits  over the past year or so, pretty near once a week

125
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:38,712
12  grand here, 16 grand there. 

126
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:41,092
Not enough to trip any bank alarms. 

127
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:43,873
But it all added up to about a million dollars. 

128
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:46,423
Okay. Gets better. 

129
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,483
Unlike their other accounts, which are in the name of mr. And mrs. , 

130
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,211
This is dr. Bannister's and dr. Bannister's alone. 

131
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:56,553
I don't understand. What could that mean?

132
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:59,300
It could mean he's been saving   up for a disappearing act. 

133
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:02,190
This is allison dubois. 

134
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:03,553
I'm marie's mother. 

135
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:06,083
Can you hear me?I'm having a difficult time hearing you. 

136
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:14,753
I'm gonna be there in about 20 minutes. Can you...  ?

137
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:45,310
Hello. Anybody home?In here!

138
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:48,943
Good evening, ladies. 

139
00:08:50,658 --> 00:08:53,230
Girls, can you give dad and me a minute, please?

140
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:05,453
Okay, who died?

141
00:09:06,555 --> 00:09:08,193
That's a terrible choice of words. 

142
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:10,343
why? What?

143
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:12,063
Did someone actually die?

144
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:14,685
No, not actually. Not yet. 

145
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:21,117
Remember that conversation that we were having this morning?

146
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:23,193
What to get ariel for her birthday?

147
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,832
No. I was asking you about wills. 

148
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,420
Well, I had this dream last night. 

149
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:31,810
I saw my own death. 

150
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,723
Well, not my death. 

151
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:37,532
My own funeral. 

152
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:41,463
And you were all there, and I was there. And it...  

153
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:42,381
okay. 

154
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:46,083
It was a dream, allison. 

155
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:49,721
And even you have dreams that are just dreams. 

156
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:53,252
Obviously you're not dead. 

157
00:09:55,157 --> 00:09:57,941
I think we have to let this one go, allison. 

158
00:09:58,088 --> 00:10:02,241
This afternoon I came this close  to plowing into a huge truck. 

159
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:08,341
Well, no...  actually, a huge truck came this  close to plowing into me. 

160
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:12,571
I  was a fraction of an inch away from death, joe. 

161
00:10:12,788 --> 00:10:14,001
Wait a second. For real?

162
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:14,851
Yes. 

163
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:16,051
I mean, I'm fine. 

164
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:18,731
There are no cuts or bruises. The car's fine. 

165
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,540
But I was inches away from death. 

166
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:25,993
Okay, that's called a coincidence. 

167
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:28,840
A very scary, very unsettling coincidence. 

168
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:29,610
I don't know. 

169
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:33,061
There was this man in my dream. 

170
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,403
He was the only person who could see me. 

171
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:38,413
What do you mean? What man?

172
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:39,463
'Cause I was dead. 

173
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:43,200
So you couldn't see me, the girls  couldn't see me, but he could see me. 

174
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:46,660
He seemed to know all about it. 

175
00:10:46,795 --> 00:10:48,122
He seemed to be running everything. 

176
00:10:48,808 --> 00:10:49,720
I don't follow. 

177
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:52,020
Death. 

178
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:53,780
Death. 

179
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:57,332
He was in charge of death. 

180
00:10:59,395 --> 00:11:03,183
He was death. The angel of death. 

181
00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:06,361
Okay. 

182
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:09,521
Again, this was a dream, allison

183
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,641
And  not a realistic dream, obviously. 

184
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:15,120
Now, that's what I thought. Or that's what I hoped. 

185
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:19,343
But then this thing happens with the truck. 

186
00:11:20,175 --> 00:11:23,561
And I turn...  and he's there. 

187
00:11:24,698 --> 00:11:26,702
Standing on the corner looking at his watch

188
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:29,950
like he had a schedule and I was on his to-do list. 

189
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:32,850
Okay, 

190
00:11:34,646 --> 00:11:35,892
you were in shock

191
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,202
You may still be in shock. 

192
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,462
He was trying to tell me something. 

193
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:41,322
I mean, not with words...  

194
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:43,550
but it was like...  

195
00:11:46,976 --> 00:11:48,882
"time up, allison. Prepare. "

196
00:11:57,096 --> 00:12:00,223
I mean, it's funny that I vaguely  remember leaving the scene. 

197
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:05,031
I barely remember picking the girls up from school. 

198
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:07,900
I just...  

199
00:12:09,115 --> 00:12:12,972
I remember getting home, going into the room, 

200
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:16,602
closing the door, and starting to sob. 

201
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:21,712
And swearing to myself i would never drive again. 

202
00:12:29,477 --> 00:12:30,873
It's okay, it's okay. 

203
00:12:32,077 --> 00:12:33,772
we're going to figure this out, all right?

204
00:12:34,428 --> 00:12:35,480
It's going to be okay. 

205
00:12:42,688 --> 00:12:43,670
hey,  it's 10:00. 

206
00:12:45,287 --> 00:12:46,313
five more minutes?

207
00:12:46,685 --> 00:12:47,232
Yeah. 

208
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,311
Is mommy feeling better?

209
00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:53,722
I don't know. I think so. She's asleep. 

210
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:56,170
She had a pretty big scare today. 

211
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:58,202
But I'm sure she's going to get over it. 

212
00:12:59,335 --> 00:13:04,341
You guys probably didn't have a chance to talk about any of the stuff i mentioned at breakfast. 

213
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,923
I'll tell you what, I'm going to make an executive decision here. 

214
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,601
And I'm sure that mommy's going to be fine with it. 

215
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:17,191
Tomorrow or the next day, we'll get you started on your own e-mail account...  

216
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:23,742
okay, here's the thing. 

217
00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:27,410
Mommy  and I are going to have full access. 

218
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:29,772
We're both going to know your password. 

219
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:31,673
We'll be able to check your e-mails, 

220
00:13:31,696 --> 00:13:33,640
we'll be able to check your trash. 

221
00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:37,240
Okay, daddy. I promise you won't be disappointed. 

222
00:13:37,497 --> 00:13:38,783
Okay, I'm counting on you. 

223
00:13:40,507 --> 00:13:42,921
This is the best birthday present ever. 

224
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,213
Well, don't say that. 

225
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:47,581
Don't say that till you've had your birthday and seen your other presents. 

226
00:13:47,946 --> 00:13:49,783
You know, they make these clocks now--

227
00:13:50,026 --> 00:13:51,901
you can actually wear them on your wrist. 

228
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:56,563
Good night, sweetie. Good night, daddy. 

229
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:58,691
Five minutes. 

230
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:04,011
oh, hello, allison. 

231
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:06,083
Good to see you again. Please come in. 

232
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:07,581
Take a seat

233
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:12,901
Clearly we are destined to do some business together, given the way we keep crossing paths. 

234
00:14:14,516 --> 00:14:16,273
Oh, heavens...  you look disappointed. 

235
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:20,172
Might I suggest that you simply surrender to the idea. 

236
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:22,033
It's inevitable, I'm afraid. 

237
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:24,593
How do I know?

238
00:14:25,946 --> 00:14:30,472
Allison, like it or not, by a hair, by a second, 

239
00:14:31,265 --> 00:14:34,123
by luck, by fate, six times a day

240
00:14:34,148 --> 00:14:37,661
you  come this close to meeting  the god to whom you pray. 

241
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:40,723
Sometimes you sense it, like today when you managed to avoid that truck. 

242
00:14:41,346 --> 00:14:44,463
But more often than not, you have no idea just how close you've come to...  

243
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:47,143
bathroom?

244
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:49,971
Right outside. 

245
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,953
Through the waiting room and to the left. 

246
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:56,062
Be careful. Bathrooms can be very dangerous places. 

247
00:14:56,387 --> 00:14:59,841
Did you know that 47% of all accidental deaths take place in the home

248
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:03,573
and that 61% of those happen in the family bathroom?

249
00:15:05,427 --> 00:15:06,002
that's all right. 

250
00:15:06,027 --> 00:15:07,053
You go ahead, I'll get that. 

251
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:11,560
what's going on?

252
00:15:11,928 --> 00:15:12,432
Hello. 

253
00:15:13,317 --> 00:15:14,750
Allison, it's manuel devalos. 

254
00:15:14,856 --> 00:15:16,831
Sorry to wake you at this ungodly hour, 

255
00:15:16,906 --> 00:15:21,141
but I just got a call that a body was  discovered at the viceroy motel downtown

256
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:24,513
that matches the general description of  dr. Dean bannister. 

257
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:27,192
I'm on my way over there now. 

258
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:28,911
Do you want to meet me there?

259
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:34,002
I...  I don't know. Drive downtown. 

260
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:35,921
Would it help if I picked you up?

261
00:15:36,906 --> 00:15:38,480
I can run the kids to school. 

262
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:41,242
That would be great. 

263
00:15:44,515 --> 00:15:47,231
It's him. Wallet was still in his pants. 

264
00:15:47,348 --> 00:15:49,400
All his id plus about 400 bucks. 

265
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:52,072
So we're not looking at robbery. 

266
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,592
I'm not sure we're looking at foul play of any kind. 

267
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,380
They found the body in there. 

268
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:57,621
In the bathroom?

269
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:01,401
You'd be amazed at how treacherous  bathrooms can be. 

270
00:16:01,538 --> 00:16:02,523
No. I've heard. 

271
00:16:03,478 --> 00:16:04,481
Appears as though he slipped in the shower, 

272
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:06,970
cracked his skull on the bathtub spigot. 

273
00:16:07,297 --> 00:16:09,692
He's been laying in there for hours with  the water running on him. 

274
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,111
The maid found him. 

275
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,633
Anybody talk to the desk clerk?

276
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:13,863
That's where it gets interesting. 

277
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:19,081
Apparently,  dr. Bannister checked into the hotel at 7:00 the night before last...  alone. 

278
00:16:19,515 --> 00:16:21,063
Just like he did every tuesday. 

279
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:24,621
Paid cash. Signed an illegible signature on the id card. 

280
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,480
So much for the tuesday racquetball game. 

281
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,962
Did the clerk happen to see who he might have been meeting?

282
00:16:30,398 --> 00:16:33,520
No, but as he reminded me, in places like this, you're actually paid not to see. 

283
00:16:33,996 --> 00:16:34,872
Shall we take a look?

284
00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:38,803
Seems pretty clear what happened. 

285
00:16:39,118 --> 00:16:41,211
I guess when your time's up, your time's up. 

286
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:46,351
I think I ought to really drive over to dr. Bannister's, house, talk to his widow. 

287
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:50,941
Any way that you can give allison a ride  home so she can pick up her car?

288
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:52,433
I don't want you to go out of your way. 

289
00:16:52,498 --> 00:16:54,762
Just if you could give me a ride to city hall

290
00:16:54,818 --> 00:16:56,532
joe can pick me upon the way home. 

291
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,593
Yeah, sure, whatever works for you. 

292
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:03,742
Did you see any condoms?

293
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:05,582
Excuse me?

294
00:17:05,947 --> 00:17:09,071
In the room back there-- did you see any condoms or condom wrappers?

295
00:17:09,616 --> 00:17:10,862
No, but what does that prove?

296
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:14,532
Threw them out, flush them down the toilet, maid cleaned the room after his guest left. 

297
00:17:14,706 --> 00:17:15,993
Where you going with this?

298
00:17:16,128 --> 00:17:17,551
The bed was made perfectly. 

299
00:17:18,248 --> 00:17:19,272
They did it in the bathroom. 

300
00:17:20,297 --> 00:17:22,831
No. The clothes were in a pile on the floor next to the bed. 

301
00:17:23,006 --> 00:17:27,133
So he did a little horizontal rumba on the bed, went out for a bite to eat, the maid cleaned the room. 

302
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:28,601
Yeah, then he came back and took a shower?

303
00:17:28,695 --> 00:17:30,272
Since when did you become  an expert on these matter?

304
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,502
I'm just saying, he had limited time. 

305
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:34,310
His wife thought he was playing racquetball. 

306
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,070
She expected him home at 9:00 or so. 

307
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:37,970
Just doesn't make any sense to me. 

308
00:17:38,497 --> 00:17:39,882
What doesn't make sense to you?

309
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:41,273
I don't think he was with a woman. 

310
00:17:42,406 --> 00:17:45,131
What, he rented a seedy hotel room so he could take a shower?

311
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:46,602
That's my point. 

312
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,292
We don't know why he was there. 

313
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:49,280
We're just guessing. 

314
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:52,352
Until we know why he was there, we can't be sure what happened to him. 

315
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:53,150
Sure we can. 

316
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,002
He slipped and fell in the shower, allison. 

317
00:17:55,027 --> 00:17:56,051
Slips happen. 

318
00:17:56,115 --> 00:17:56,961
It was his time. 

319
00:17:57,395 --> 00:17:58,563
And when it's your time, it's your time

320
00:17:58,657 --> 00:17:59,601
Says who?

321
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:12,642
I...  I've been thinking about the bannister case. 

322
00:18:13,115 --> 00:18:14,150
It's not a case, allison. 

323
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:15,000
These  are cases. 

324
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:17,373
There's a crime, there's a motive, there's a suspect. 

325
00:18:17,658 --> 00:18:18,641
But I have those. 

326
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:19,981
Really?

327
00:18:20,937 --> 00:18:21,550
So now you tell me

328
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:26,792
you think some fiend slicked up that tub so dr. B would slip on purpose?

329
00:18:28,877 --> 00:18:30,231
Sykes V. Bannister. 

330
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:36,291
Turns out dr. Bannister is being sued by the father of a patient named jeremy sykes who died while under his care. 

331
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,653
He's a cancer doctor, allison. 

332
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:39,882
Lawsuits are practically part of the job description. 

333
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:44,612
Yes, but sykes went so far as to physically attack bannister during pretrial hearings. 

334
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,001
I take it he thought his son's death was somehow bannister's fault. 

335
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:50,651
Well, apparently, bannister was one of a handful of doctors

336
00:18:50,717 --> 00:18:54,651
treating patients with diathamoxin

337
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,313
I know. I haven't heard of it either. 

338
00:18:58,378 --> 00:18:58,961
It's new. 

339
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:00,503
It's from switzerland. 

340
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:03,791
Hasn't been approved by the fda, so insurance won't cover it. 

341
00:19:05,265 --> 00:19:08,783
So sykes thought he was paying for a miracle cure, and when he didn't get it...  

342
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,931
not only didn't he get it, but according to the claim that sykes filed, 

343
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:16,483
jeremy got precipitously worse after taking this drugand died six months later. 

344
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:19,962
You have a crime, you have a suspect, you have a motive. 

345
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,342
I'll tell you what. 

346
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:25,402
The coroner's report should be issued tomorrow. 

347
00:19:25,488 --> 00:19:27,002
Why don't you and i take a ride down there. 

348
00:19:27,026 --> 00:19:29,522
If he gives me some reason to think that it wasn't an accident, 

349
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:32,292
I'll follow up on this hunch of yours. 

350
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,301
Something else?

351
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:41,411
Can you give me a ride somewhere?

352
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:43,312
It was so cool, daddy. 

353
00:19:43,858 --> 00:19:47,972
I bet that the kids at school thought that we were getting arrested. 

354
00:19:48,557 --> 00:19:49,951
One can only hope. 

355
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,663
Detective scanlon let me turn on the sirens. 

356
00:19:54,056 --> 00:19:55,152
It was pretty exciting. 

357
00:19:55,398 --> 00:19:56,672
Could we do it again tomorrow?

358
00:19:57,215 --> 00:19:58,643
Yeah, mom, can you drive me to work?

359
00:20:17,107 --> 00:20:20,783
abandon all hope, ye who enter here. 

360
00:20:24,095 --> 00:20:26,931
Not exactly dante's inferno, but close enough. 

361
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:32,163
Six months. 

362
00:20:40,628 --> 00:20:41,692
Six weeks. 

363
00:20:49,185 --> 00:20:50,250
Two years tops. 

364
00:20:50,947 --> 00:20:52,642
And there's no hope for any of them?

365
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:53,762
There's an old saying. 

366
00:20:54,315 --> 00:20:56,591
"The enemies of death are luck and hope. "

367
00:20:57,278 --> 00:20:59,880
It's not true by the way. I'm good friends with both. 

368
00:21:03,186 --> 00:21:05,442
I'm going to let you in on a secret, allison. 

369
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:08,623
It's not about the archetypal constructs of

370
00:21:08,757 --> 00:21:11,731
good and evil, faith and hope, life and the death

371
00:21:11,908 --> 00:21:15,293
It's about science, math, biology, 

372
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:17,870
the politics of finance, globle enconomics

373
00:21:18,295 --> 00:21:20,530
the cost of living versus the cost of dying, 

374
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:23,542
who can afford how much and who's willing to pay. 

375
00:21:26,325 --> 00:21:28,312
Death is good. 

376
00:21:29,448 --> 00:21:30,651
Death is necessary. 

377
00:21:31,078 --> 00:21:32,581
And with a little bit of planning, 

378
00:21:32,647 --> 00:21:35,981
death can even be a win-win. 

379
00:21:36,565 --> 00:21:40,061
I honestly marvel at how passionately some people resist it. 

380
00:21:40,136 --> 00:21:41,451
Take this case. 

381
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,141
Truly tragic. 

382
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:50,412
Is he going to die soon?

383
00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:51,671
No, damn it. 

384
00:21:51,748 --> 00:21:53,140
He's going to go into remission. 

385
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:56,033
He's going to live a long and happy life, I'm afraid. 

386
00:22:01,146 --> 00:22:05,522
Tell me, have you had a physical recently?

387
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:12,461
Is there any way i could come in today?

388
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:15,101
Who's mommy talking to?

389
00:22:15,198 --> 00:22:16,041
Doctor's office. 

390
00:22:17,797 --> 00:22:19,891
If you don't have time for a full physical, 

391
00:22:19,927 --> 00:22:23,781
is there any way i can come in for like a mini checkup just to tide me over?

392
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:27,642
1:30 today. Okay, great

393
00:22:29,328 --> 00:22:30,163
Thanks bye

394
00:22:31,926 --> 00:22:32,650
Good morning. 

395
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:34,192
Mini  checkup?

396
00:22:34,808 --> 00:22:36,650
I don't think they have those in our plan. 

397
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:40,762
Hey, can I talk to you over here for a moment?

398
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:50,832
I'm having a little anxiety about my health. 

399
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:51,823
I don't see why. 

400
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:55,291
What with all the extra walking you'll be doing not that you won't drive. 

401
00:22:56,097 --> 00:22:57,162
I'm asking for your help. 

402
00:22:58,185 --> 00:23:01,902
What? 1:30?You want me to drive you?

403
00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:03,883
I'll be at work, allison. 

404
00:23:04,137 --> 00:23:05,562
I don't need you to take me. 

405
00:23:06,147 --> 00:23:09,071
Detective scanlon's coming to pick me up this morning to take me to the morgue. 

406
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:10,600
I'll probably get him to drop me off. 

407
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:14,040
I just need you to pick me up around 3:00 so we can go get the girls. 

408
00:23:14,147 --> 00:23:15,503
Are you listening to yourself?

409
00:23:15,868 --> 00:23:18,032
One simple errand now involves

410
00:23:18,108 --> 00:23:20,882
a police escort and your husband taking off work early. 

411
00:23:21,536 --> 00:23:22,890
Could I take that as a yes?

412
00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:30,270
Are you sure? I mean, he couldn't have been hit and moved into the shower to make it look like an accident?

413
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:32,251
Not likely. 

414
00:23:33,017 --> 00:23:36,692
You see here how this fits the indentation in the skull?

415
00:23:37,455 --> 00:23:41,090
So his injury is completely consistent with an accidental fall in the bathtub. 

416
00:23:41,557 --> 00:23:43,281
You'd be surprised how common that is. 

417
00:23:46,817 --> 00:23:48,312
You're not taking thomas road?

418
00:23:48,826 --> 00:23:50,390
It's faster. 

419
00:23:50,608 --> 00:23:53,620
This is the intersection where I almost got hit by that truck. 

420
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,781
Oh, my god. That's him. 

421
00:24:01,887 --> 00:24:02,803
That's death. 

422
00:24:04,745 --> 00:24:05,691
Huh, what are you talking about?

423
00:24:06,677 --> 00:24:07,812
On that bus bench. 

424
00:24:14,027 --> 00:24:17,522
Death's name is "bob"?

425
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:20,202
But I don't understand. 

426
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:21,880
No one I know sends me an e-mail. 

427
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,102
No one I know has my e-mail address, 

428
00:24:24,205 --> 00:24:26,631
but I still keep getting mail from people I've never met. 

429
00:24:26,957 --> 00:24:28,081
It's called spam, sweetie. 

430
00:24:28,105 --> 00:24:30,791
It's like junk mail, but it goes through your computer. 

431
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:33,820
But I don't like it. I want real mail. 

432
00:24:34,355 --> 00:24:35,070
Tell you what. 

433
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,962
When I get into work, I'll send you something. 

434
00:24:40,658 --> 00:24:41,723
Here. thank you

435
00:24:46,716 --> 00:24:48,181
You still looking at this guy?

436
00:24:49,175 --> 00:24:50,200
I'm going to call him. 

437
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:53,202
Why? We already have an insurance agent. 

438
00:24:54,736 --> 00:24:57,651
Besides, I'm not sure how I feel about buying life from death. 

439
00:24:58,118 --> 00:24:58,890
Not funny. 

440
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,403
I'm going to buy anything. 

441
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:02,382
I'm not going to sign anything. 

442
00:25:03,305 --> 00:25:05,910
I'm just going to meet with him, get to the bottom of this thing. 

443
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:06,741
What thing?

444
00:25:09,378 --> 00:25:11,443
I'm just going to say this, allison. 

445
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:15,372
You used to drive through that intersection every day. 

446
00:25:15,986 --> 00:25:16,530
So?

447
00:25:16,786 --> 00:25:18,211
So isn't it possible

448
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:22,023
that you may have personified your anxieties about death?

449
00:25:22,718 --> 00:25:23,991
About mortality, 

450
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:25,551
about leaving the girls, 

451
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:26,943
leaving me

452
00:25:27,677 --> 00:25:29,073
and given them a face, 

453
00:25:30,575 --> 00:25:31,341
his face?

454
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:36,893
You know what?I take it back. 

455
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:39,462
Call this guy. Go see him. 

456
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:41,592
But do yourself a favor and drive there. 

457
00:25:42,137 --> 00:25:43,492
Why are you saying this?

458
00:25:43,525 --> 00:25:45,292
Because if this guy is really death

459
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,012
and your number really is up

460
00:25:49,408 --> 00:25:52,310
then it's up whether you drive or not. 

461
00:25:52,565 --> 00:25:55,173
But if this guy is just an insurance agent, 

462
00:25:55,757 --> 00:25:58,911
then you living your life in fear of something that might happen, 

463
00:26:00,078 --> 00:26:01,320
that's no way toive. 

464
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:11,242
anything you need, 

465
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:12,372
anything at all. 

466
00:26:12,736 --> 00:26:16,112
I hear there's aotor in flagstaff who might be willing to prescribe it. 

467
00:26:16,216 --> 00:26:17,483
If you have any trouble getting in to see him, 

468
00:26:17,587 --> 00:26:20,843
you tell them your viatical is with me and there's plenty of money left over for your treatment. 

469
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:23,013
Thank you, mr. Sherman. 

470
00:26:23,057 --> 00:26:24,121
It's my pleasure. For everything

471
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:25,000
Of course. 

472
00:26:29,866 --> 00:26:31,251
I still can't believe he's gone. 

473
00:26:31,385 --> 00:26:34,612
Yes, dr. Bannister was a lovely, lovely man. 

474
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,620
Oh, you must be mrs. Dubois. 

475
00:26:40,977 --> 00:26:44,062
The only inevitable things in life are death, 

476
00:26:44,307 --> 00:26:47,833
taxes and my assistant catching the flu at the worst possible time. 

477
00:26:48,678 --> 00:26:49,663
I'm just about done here. 

478
00:26:49,946 --> 00:26:52,111
Thank you for seeing me on such short notice. 

479
00:26:52,385 --> 00:26:53,152
Oh, it's my pleasure. 

480
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,511
You're one of the few, mrs. Dubois, I can tell. 

481
00:26:57,277 --> 00:26:57,973
The few?

482
00:26:58,987 --> 00:27:00,783
Most people think they're going to live forever, 

483
00:27:00,845 --> 00:27:05,003
but there are a few of us who realize  that each moment could potentially be our last. 

484
00:27:05,655 --> 00:27:07,702
We are the ones who prepare for the inevitable. 

485
00:27:09,926 --> 00:27:12,232
It's none of my business, but the man who just left. 

486
00:27:13,147 --> 00:27:13,840
Leukemia. 

487
00:27:16,247 --> 00:27:18,181
Was he a patient of dr. Bannister's?

488
00:27:18,316 --> 00:27:19,232
Oh, did you know dean?

489
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:21,942
No, not personally. 

490
00:27:22,388 --> 00:27:24,320
I know people who are very fond of him. 

491
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:28,240
Pathetic way to lose one's life, isn't it, 

492
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,053
taking a spill in the shower?

493
00:27:32,366 --> 00:27:33,903
Pathetic but not uncommon, I'm afraid. 

494
00:27:34,497 --> 00:27:37,872
Did you know that the average bathroom is one of the most perilous places on earth, 

495
00:27:38,078 --> 00:27:39,760
statistically speaking of course?

496
00:27:40,186 --> 00:27:40,952
I heard that. 

497
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:44,940
How well did you know dr. Bannister?

498
00:27:45,928 --> 00:27:48,821
Oh, I wrote a policy for him  and his wife several years ago and we became friends. 

499
00:27:50,095 --> 00:27:52,772
We used to play racquetball virtually every tuesday. 

500
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:54,770
Him. That's him. 

501
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:56,452
And the crime is?

502
00:27:56,656 --> 00:27:58,200
He said they played racquetball. 

503
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,102
Racquetball-playing and the claim to have played racquetball

504
00:28:02,128 --> 00:28:04,801
both have been decriminalized in arizona for quite some time. 

505
00:28:05,158 --> 00:28:06,031
You're mocking me. 

506
00:28:06,205 --> 00:28:07,690
I'm trying to reason with you. 

507
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:10,761
The victim in question appears to have slipped and fallen in a bathtub. 

508
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,612
That's heartbreaking, allison, 

509
00:28:13,047 --> 00:28:14,033
but it's not illegal. 

510
00:28:22,446 --> 00:28:25,161
someone! Anyone!

511
00:28:31,986 --> 00:28:33,823
You can't stop the inevitable, allison. 

512
00:28:35,477 --> 00:28:37,162
So why not hurry it along instead?

513
00:28:44,817 --> 00:28:46,910
morning, early bird. What you doing, homework?

514
00:28:48,107 --> 00:28:49,422
No, I'm sending an e-mail. 

515
00:28:49,857 --> 00:28:51,942
So one of your friends  finally sent you an e-mail, huh?

516
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,681
No, I'm writing this company telling them to stop e-mailing me. 

517
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:58,173
They're writing, like, 20 e-mails a day, 

518
00:28:58,176 --> 00:29:00,111
and I have no idea what they're even talking about. 

519
00:29:04,257 --> 00:29:08,993
There's usually something you can click on the bottom of the letter to get off their mailing list. 

520
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:09,621
I've done that. 

521
00:29:09,945 --> 00:29:11,372
I've done that, like, ten times, 

522
00:29:11,397 --> 00:29:13,172
and every time they'd write me a letter

523
00:29:13,228 --> 00:29:14,733
assuring me that this is not spam

524
00:29:14,797 --> 00:29:16,440
and that they're writing especially to me. 

525
00:29:17,578 --> 00:29:18,691
Can I see some of these letters?

526
00:29:18,737 --> 00:29:19,873
Can you print some out?

527
00:29:20,338 --> 00:29:24,190
"Ariel, you could be making big money buying and selling viaticals. "

528
00:29:25,137 --> 00:29:26,633
"Ariel, why aren't you profiting

529
00:29:27,588 --> 00:29:30,132
from the easy money to be made in viaticals?"

530
00:29:30,848 --> 00:29:33,793
"Ariel, want to get started in viaticals?We'll show you how. "

531
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:35,942
What's a viatical?

532
00:29:36,448 --> 00:29:37,360
A viatical. 

533
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:42,070
It's an instrument created to theoretically help  people realize

534
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:44,872
the value of their life insurance before they die. 

535
00:29:45,705 --> 00:29:47,433
You mean a way to borrow against it?

536
00:29:47,675 --> 00:29:48,660
Well, sort of. 

537
00:29:49,678 --> 00:29:53,322
Say you have a life insurance policy that pays out a million dollars upon your death

538
00:29:53,396 --> 00:29:55,202
but you need the money now to, 

539
00:29:55,578 --> 00:29:56,262
I don't know, 

540
00:29:56,518 --> 00:29:58,751
pay for an experimental drug treatment to keep you alive. 

541
00:29:59,268 --> 00:30:01,372
You can sell your policy to someone like sherman, 

542
00:30:01,525 --> 00:30:03,623
who agrees to give you a couple hundred grand up front, 

543
00:30:03,695 --> 00:30:04,721
pay your premiums, 

544
00:30:04,757 --> 00:30:07,723
plus give you a monthly stipend s long as you're alive. 

545
00:30:07,995 --> 00:30:09,242
Well, what's in it for sherman?

546
00:30:09,528 --> 00:30:11,152
Well, he's betting that you die

547
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:13,042
before he has to pay out the whole million. 

548
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:16,412
And if you do, he gets to pocket the balance. 

549
00:30:17,068 --> 00:30:18,302
What a cynical way to make a living. 

550
00:30:19,325 --> 00:30:20,791
No wonder I dreamt he was death. 

551
00:30:22,148 --> 00:30:23,311
Still doesn't make him a murderer. 

552
00:30:23,598 --> 00:30:25,363
I know, but there is some connection, 

553
00:30:25,488 --> 00:30:26,553
and it's not just racquetball. 

554
00:30:26,885 --> 00:30:29,622
I saw him standing in that motel room, 

555
00:30:29,698 --> 00:30:32,902
a wall of fire behind him, welcoming bannister. 

556
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,120
Well, they were colleaguesof a sort. 

557
00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:38,050
One man administered the experimental drug treatment, 

558
00:30:38,117 --> 00:30:39,431
and the other helped you pay for it. 

559
00:30:42,415 --> 00:30:43,843
What if the drugs were bad?

560
00:30:45,487 --> 00:30:46,180
I don't follow. 

561
00:30:47,536 --> 00:30:50,791
I had this dream last night i was in this hospital ward, 

562
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:54,632
and this woman, she was struggling against the drugs she had been given. 

563
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:56,012
Turns out, they weren't drugs at all. 

564
00:30:56,077 --> 00:30:58,292
It was just...  sand. 

565
00:30:59,665 --> 00:31:00,783
I still don't follow. 

566
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:03,812
If your drugs are bad, you die quicker, right?

567
00:31:04,475 --> 00:31:08,430
Which is good for whoever buys your viatical, isn't it?

568
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:11,500
It's an interesting theory. 

569
00:31:13,728 --> 00:31:15,671
Maybe I'll have scanlon do a little research. 

570
00:31:16,557 --> 00:31:17,402
Research? That's it?

571
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,702
Well, let's see how the research goes, 

572
00:31:19,728 --> 00:31:22,773
and if we like what we see, maybe we'll play a little poker. 

573
00:31:24,228 --> 00:31:26,132
Poker?With who?

574
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:38,430
Mr. Sherman, I appreciate you coming down here. 

575
00:31:39,046 --> 00:31:43,391
In the course of investigating the death of your friend, your client dr. Bannister, 

576
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:46,001
some questions have arisen about the nature of his medical practice. 

577
00:31:47,078 --> 00:31:50,483
My questions really have to do with certain civil suits that were pending

578
00:31:50,777 --> 00:31:52,912
against dr. Bannister prior to his passing. 

579
00:31:54,858 --> 00:31:55,700
I see. 

580
00:31:56,738 --> 00:32:00,110
I was hardly privy to everything about his practice, 

581
00:32:00,656 --> 00:32:02,200
but I'll be glad to tell you what I know. 

582
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,442
Do you recognize any of the names on the list?

583
00:32:08,756 --> 00:32:10,400
I take it this is a list of dean's patients?

584
00:32:12,647 --> 00:32:13,562
Yes, I do. 

585
00:32:14,255 --> 00:32:15,790
I did business with several of them. 

586
00:32:16,188 --> 00:32:20,042
By business, you mean you purchased their life insurance policies, isn't that right?

587
00:32:20,918 --> 00:32:24,071
Providing viaticals for them to pay for their treatments?

588
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:26,191
With several of them, yes. 

589
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:29,232
Nine, actually, out of the 23 patients on the list. 

590
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:32,802
Out of the 23 patients involved in bannister's experimental drug treatments, 

591
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:35,011
you purchased the life insurance policies of nine. 

592
00:32:35,407 --> 00:32:36,211
Isn't that correct?

593
00:32:36,607 --> 00:32:37,372
It's possible. 

594
00:32:38,605 --> 00:32:40,072
I don't have my records with me. 

595
00:32:40,205 --> 00:32:42,482
Be glad to confirm that figure when I return to my office. 

596
00:32:43,605 --> 00:32:44,930
Am I missing something here?

597
00:32:45,586 --> 00:32:48,513
I'm curious. Did dr. Bannister refer these patients to you?

598
00:32:48,615 --> 00:32:51,033
Yes, he did. I was only too happy to help. 

599
00:32:51,215 --> 00:32:51,981
Help?

600
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:53,841
I'm confused. 

601
00:32:54,718 --> 00:32:56,001
The way that I understood it, 

602
00:32:56,945 --> 00:32:59,211
the quicker these patients die, the more you stand to profit. 

603
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:03,542
Everyone dies. 

604
00:33:04,188 --> 00:33:06,653
And every business existsto make a profit. 

605
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:11,363
Now, it's true, mine may appear to be an especially morbid business, 

606
00:33:11,455 --> 00:33:14,051
but...  the fact is, 

607
00:33:14,685 --> 00:33:20,952
a viatical can be a godsend to a poor soul who's fighting for his life and has no other resources. 

608
00:33:22,757 --> 00:33:26,060
Still, what you do isn't exactly charity, mr. Sherman. 

609
00:33:26,456 --> 00:33:28,652
You don't really understand the business of dying, do you?

610
00:33:30,595 --> 00:33:32,133
I'm a homicide detective, sir. 

611
00:33:32,155 --> 00:33:33,663
Oh, yes. You know about death. 

612
00:33:33,948 --> 00:33:35,550
The messy aftermath, the suffering. 

613
00:33:36,608 --> 00:33:39,181
But I'm talking about the suffering itself, detective. 

614
00:33:39,356 --> 00:33:40,531
I'm talking about dying. 

615
00:33:41,627 --> 00:33:46,772
A dying man will do anything in his power to cling to the last shreds of life, 

616
00:33:46,866 --> 00:33:49,023
no matter how painful his existence has become. 

617
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:51,180
He'll do anything, 

618
00:33:51,355 --> 00:33:52,643
give anything

619
00:33:53,328 --> 00:33:58,170
sell any thing all for a little hope

620
00:33:58,525 --> 00:33:59,703
And you gave that hope. 

621
00:33:59,835 --> 00:34:01,192
Yes, I did. 

622
00:34:02,685 --> 00:34:04,422
And dr. Bannister gave them even more than that. 

623
00:34:04,555 --> 00:34:05,470
He gave them results. 

624
00:34:05,556 --> 00:34:07,762
The man was considered something of a miracle worker. 

625
00:34:07,818 --> 00:34:09,180
You see, that's the strange part. 

626
00:34:09,317 --> 00:34:12,062
That's the part that we can't quite figure out because, for a miracle worker, 

627
00:34:12,155 --> 00:34:13,950
dr. Bannister was having a pretty off year. 

628
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:15,113
How do you mean?

629
00:34:15,907 --> 00:34:19,322
Of the 23 patients involved in bannister's experimental drug program, 

630
00:34:19,426 --> 00:34:21,403
12 of them died in the past nine months. 

631
00:34:21,575 --> 00:34:25,133
And of that 12, seven of them had sold their life insurance policies to you. 

632
00:34:26,155 --> 00:34:27,061
Seven, you say?

633
00:34:28,697 --> 00:34:29,683
I had no idea it was that many. 

634
00:34:29,797 --> 00:34:31,212
You want to hear another strange statistic?

635
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:34,462
According to the records of bannister's swiss drug supplier, 

636
00:34:34,568 --> 00:34:38,533
bannister purchased enough medication to treat ten patients last year. 

637
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:41,420
Remarkably, he managed to treat 23. 

638
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:46,261
We believe that dr. Bannister may have been diluting his drugs. 

639
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:47,683
That's absurd. 

640
00:34:48,198 --> 00:34:51,163
Dr. Bannister was a brilliant, compassionate man. 

641
00:34:52,476 --> 00:34:54,243
He loved his patients above all things. 

642
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,563
Well, maybe not above all things. 

643
00:34:57,435 --> 00:34:59,882
And as you pointed out, everyone dies eventually. 

644
00:35:00,627 --> 00:35:01,282
Anyway. 

645
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:07,962
The sad truth is, it appears the good doctor's patients paid full price for their treatment

646
00:35:08,096 --> 00:35:11,471
and were getting medications that were only a third of the necessary potency. 

647
00:35:11,646 --> 00:35:13,691
With bannister pocketing the difference. 

648
00:35:13,868 --> 00:35:14,411
I'm sorry. 

649
00:35:15,506 --> 00:35:17,603
None of this sounds like the man I know. 

650
00:35:17,636 --> 00:35:22,450
I mean, really, how much money could possibly be made by diluting a handful of patients' drugs?

651
00:35:22,516 --> 00:35:23,323
It sounds preposterous. 

652
00:35:23,347 --> 00:35:24,031
I agree. 

653
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:28,691
Which brings me back to the seven patients  whose life insurance policies you bought

654
00:35:28,978 --> 00:35:32,010
and who began dying shortly after you started paying for their treatment. 

655
00:35:32,636 --> 00:35:35,230
Were they just terribly unlucky, 

656
00:35:35,255 --> 00:35:38,890
or were you incredibly good at picking winners?

657
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:43,312
The two of you were quite a team, weren't you?

658
00:35:43,777 --> 00:35:48,552
He would make sure the patients whose viaticals you owned started dying a little quicker, 

659
00:35:48,645 --> 00:35:50,222
and in return, he got a cut of the payment. 

660
00:35:53,177 --> 00:35:54,582
Am I being charged with something?

661
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:56,333
Is that what's going on here?

662
00:36:03,637 --> 00:36:05,442
I'm guessing from your collective silence

663
00:36:05,507 --> 00:36:08,303
that you don't have the evidence to support these absurd allegations. 

664
00:36:10,307 --> 00:36:11,143
Of course not. 

665
00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:13,321
They're not true. 

666
00:36:19,566 --> 00:36:21,320
what active imaginations you all have. 

667
00:36:24,258 --> 00:36:25,420
How dare you?

668
00:36:26,035 --> 00:36:28,531
For god's sake, the man slipped and fell in his shower. 

669
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:32,631
You'll be hearing from my attorney. 

670
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:33,663
Have no fear. 

671
00:36:34,746 --> 00:36:36,331
Your attorney will be hearing from me. 

672
00:37:27,837 --> 00:37:29,010
I know how he did it. 

673
00:37:29,225 --> 00:37:31,570
Dr. Bannister didn't slip and fall by accident. 

674
00:37:31,638 --> 00:37:33,131
Sherman planned the whole thing. 

675
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:34,521
Allison. I saw it

676
00:37:34,728 --> 00:37:37,073
He unscrewed the spigot from the bathtub wall. 

677
00:37:37,178 --> 00:37:41,832
He smashed bannister in the skull, then he dragged his body  back over to the tub to make it look like a fall. 

678
00:37:42,798 --> 00:37:43,492
Allison...  you should have seen him

679
00:37:43,557 --> 00:37:44,840
That cold bastard. 

680
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:50,192
Arranging bannister's body so it would match the hundreds of slip-and-sue cases he's settled on over the years. 

681
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:53,360
Putting plastic on the floor so their would be no blood for us to...  allison!

682
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:56,640
I believe you. 

683
00:37:58,615 --> 00:37:59,420
I believe you. 

684
00:37:59,426 --> 00:38:01,333
I'm just not sure there is anything i can do about it. 

685
00:38:02,425 --> 00:38:05,182
The fact is, forensics has already been over that spigot. 

686
00:38:05,286 --> 00:38:08,730
The bathtub, bannister's body, they're all clean. 

687
00:38:09,946 --> 00:38:10,961
I don't understand, then. 

688
00:38:11,037 --> 00:38:12,133
Why would you believe me?

689
00:38:12,388 --> 00:38:13,552
Wh-what's changed your mind?

690
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:17,243
Well  after our meeting yesterday, I had a thought. 

691
00:38:17,975 --> 00:38:20,271
I told detective scanlon to go back to that motel

692
00:38:20,487 --> 00:38:22,090
and ask the desk clerk one more time

693
00:38:22,236 --> 00:38:25,240
if he remembered seeing anyone that might have been meeting bannister, 

694
00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:29,193
and, to make it clear that we weren't necessarily talking about a female. 

695
00:38:29,326 --> 00:38:33,011
I also asked him to bring along the ad from the phone book you had given me, 

696
00:38:33,106 --> 00:38:34,681
the one with sherman's picture in it. 

697
00:38:34,817 --> 00:38:35,842
That he recognized. 

698
00:38:36,345 --> 00:38:38,373
Turns out he was very familiar with sherman. 

699
00:38:38,805 --> 00:38:40,233
Well, what are we going to do now?

700
00:38:40,335 --> 00:38:41,330
That's what I'm trying to tell you. 

701
00:38:41,395 --> 00:38:42,192
I already did it. 

702
00:38:42,225 --> 00:38:44,840
I told scanlon to bring sherman back in for questioning. 

703
00:38:45,355 --> 00:38:47,220
He went over to his office first thing this morning. 

704
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:49,192
Oh, my god, that's great. 

705
00:38:49,247 --> 00:38:49,903
It's closed. 

706
00:38:51,516 --> 00:38:52,242
Excuse me?

707
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:53,401
His office. 

708
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,010
It's closed. 

709
00:38:55,478 --> 00:38:57,930
Looks like he got out all the important things last night. 

710
00:38:57,996 --> 00:39:00,030
Scanlon went over to his house-- same thing there. 

711
00:39:00,278 --> 00:39:02,952
Bank accounts emptied, no forwarding numbers on his phones. 

712
00:39:03,636 --> 00:39:04,731
Well, where would he have gone?

713
00:39:05,127 --> 00:39:06,463
Out of the country, I guess. 

714
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:07,623
Cayman islands, maybe. 

715
00:39:07,685 --> 00:39:08,893
They like american money. Who knows. 

716
00:39:10,966 --> 00:39:11,690
He did it. 

717
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:15,361
I think he did. 

718
00:39:16,496 --> 00:39:20,762
And I think, for the moment, he wins. 

719
00:39:21,786 --> 00:39:23,761
It's just...  wrong, joe

720
00:39:23,935 --> 00:39:27,052
It's wrong that this guy should cause so much pain and misery

721
00:39:27,128 --> 00:39:28,701
to  others and just get away with it

722
00:39:29,308 --> 00:39:30,521
I agree with you. 

723
00:39:31,026 --> 00:39:34,111
It's a terrible thing, and he's a terrible guy. 

724
00:39:34,797 --> 00:39:36,420
But there's nothing for you to do now. 

725
00:39:36,597 --> 00:39:38,462
You've done all that you can do. 

726
00:39:39,607 --> 00:39:42,011
Now you just have to, I don't know, 

727
00:39:42,108 --> 00:39:43,721
let it go and trust that...  

728
00:39:44,158 --> 00:39:45,213
trust that what?

729
00:39:46,006 --> 00:39:48,213
Trust that what goes around comes around, 

730
00:39:48,446 --> 00:39:51,913
that he'll get his, that there's some kind of justice out there in the universe. 

731
00:39:52,045 --> 00:39:53,142
You don't believe that. 

732
00:39:53,278 --> 00:39:54,783
I don't know what I believe. 

733
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:56,820
It's almost midnight, 

734
00:39:56,887 --> 00:39:58,672
and we've been talking about this for hours. 

735
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:01,852
I believe we need to get some sleep. 

736
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:04,593
I believe that everything will work out. 

737
00:40:05,096 --> 00:40:06,041
It always does. 

738
00:40:07,176 --> 00:40:08,753
I'm glad that you're so certain. 

739
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:12,261
'Cause I'm not sure i believe that anymore. 

740
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:15,233
I'm not sure that things do come around. 

741
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:19,663
I'm not sure about anything. 

742
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:33,550
if that's the mai tai I ordered, 

743
00:40:33,616 --> 00:40:37,203
could you just please bring it in here and place it on the counter, my good fellow?

744
00:40:52,346 --> 00:40:53,633
nice to see you, mr. Sherman. 

745
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,523
Ready to do a little business?

746
00:40:57,546 --> 00:41:01,250
Did you know that 47% of all accidental deaths take place in the home?

747
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:04,551
And 61% of those happen in the bathroom. 

748
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:08,573
Caymans are really lovely this time of year. 

749
00:41:09,297 --> 00:41:11,832
You really should be quite pleased with yourself. 

750
00:41:12,226 --> 00:41:14,501
You've chosen a spectacular place to die. 

751
00:41:19,116 --> 00:41:20,142
Watch that soap. 

752
00:41:41,268 --> 00:41:42,040
Are you all right?

753
00:41:42,988 --> 00:41:43,863
Everything okay?

754
00:41:44,626 --> 00:41:45,462
What's going on?

755
00:41:46,566 --> 00:41:47,470
Oh, nothing. 

756
00:41:49,898 --> 00:41:54,040
I just got woken up by the sound of everything coming around. 

757
00:41:57,876 --> 00:41:58,710
nothing. 

758
00:42:00,028 --> 00:42:02,220
Never mind. Everything's fine

759
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:07,491
go back to sleep.
