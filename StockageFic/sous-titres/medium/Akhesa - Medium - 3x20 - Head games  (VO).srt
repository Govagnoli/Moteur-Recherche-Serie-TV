1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,300
Oh, my God, you're
gambling again.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,700
Hey, I'm talking
to you!

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,900
Yeah, yeah, I know, babe.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,100
If you could just
hold that thought till the end
of this quarter.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,400
You want to put
that back on?

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,900
No, I don't.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,500
In case you've forgotten,

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,100
it's my money that's
paying for this room,

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,300
just like it's going
to be my money that covers your bad bet.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,300
Fine.
Message delivered.

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,000
It's your money we play
with in this marriage.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,900
You're the one with
the trust fund.

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,300
Now put the
set back on.

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,000
You know, Walt,
it's times like these

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,900
I thank God
my mother made me get a prenup.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What?

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,300
You going to hit me?

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,200
Go ahead.

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,600
Make all this even easier.

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Hit you?

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,100
Are you kidding?

22
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,200
I wish you were dead.

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Walt?

24
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,200
Natalie Paxton?

25
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
How did you know?

26
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,100
'Cause you grabbed
your neck.

27
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,200
You always
grab your neck

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,400
when you're dreaming
about Natalie Paxton.

29
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,100
I guess I
do, don't I?

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,900
Oh, well, those dreams
can't go on much longer.

31
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,600
Tomorrow's closing
arguments, right?

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,700
So it seems pretty clear
that jury's gonna

33
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,200
send her husband
away forever.

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,900
Let's hope so.

35
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,100
And the only thing I
don't get is how

36
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,900
after having the same dream
over and over again,

37
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,100
it still manages
to scare you.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,400
I don't know.

39
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,200
The whole thing
is so morbid.

40
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,300
The guy kills
his wife.

41
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,700
He chops off
her head.

42
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,000
And then takes it,
puts it somewhere.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,100
Hides it somewhere.

44
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,100
But, honey, you've dreamt
this dream how many times now?

45
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
I mean, after a while,

46
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,700
don't you start
to get a little... desensitized?

47
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,700
No, I don't.
Not even a little.

48
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,700
Personally,
I'm starting to think

49
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,300
it might be time
to have a conversation with the late Mrs. Paxton.

50
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,200
Explain to her
there may be other dead people

51
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,400
who need your help,

52
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,800
and she can't be monopolizing
your dreamtime like this.

53
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,300
Yeah? Well, next time
I see her, I'll tell her.

54
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,200
Right after I ask her where her loving husband
stashed her head.

55
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,200
Allison!

56
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

57
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
It was Natalie.

58
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,800
Paxton. Got it.

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:28,400

sync:FRM@FRM@π€∫£Œ¿</font>

61
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,400
Girls, come on!

62
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
I've got cereal
getting soggy in here!

63
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,700
Sweetie, what is it?
What's wrong?

64
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Are you hurt?

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,900
Well, I don't
understand.

66
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,700
Why aren't
you talking?

67
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,000
She can't talk.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,200
She's not allowed.

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,900
Not allowed?

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,100
She's jinxed!

71
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,400
Okay, Ariel, why don't you
tell me what's going on here?

72
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,500
Well, Marie sneezed
this morning

73
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,000
and that person over there and I
both said "bless you,"

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,900
so I jinxed her.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,300
And now she can't speak
until someone says her name,

76
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
or she'll have bad luck
for the rest of her life.

77
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,600
You're kidding. I remember this
from when I was a girl.

78
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,600
Honey, it's okay.

79
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
It's just a game.
It's not true.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes, it is.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,600
And it's not a game.

82
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,700
It's a curse
that's been around for thousands of years.

83
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,900
Don't do it, Mom, or you'll have bad luck
for the rest of your life.

84
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,500
Bridgette.

85
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,400
Bridgette, Bridgette, Bridgette.

86
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,600
Thank you!

87
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,100
I thought I wouldn't
ever be able to talk again!

88
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,100
Oh, no, that'd
be awful.

89
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,300
Okay, guys, come on,
finish your cereal.

90
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,600
I gotta go talk to Daddy.

91
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,700
Hey.

92
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,600
Help me out here.

93
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,800
Which, which one of these shirts
looks the most well-adjusted?

94
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Well, I say the...
the one on the left looks,

95
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,400
uh, a little
paranoid to me.

96
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,900
And the one on the right looks
like it has anger issues.

97
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,900
Pretty excited about going
to the therapist, huh?

98
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,500
Oh, yeah. Huh?

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,700
Well, you want some company?

100
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,300
Going to the company-
ordered shrink?

101
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
Well, yeah, I could drive you.

102
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,100
You know, wait with you.

103
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,500
Who knows? Maybe he'll even
let me come in with you.

104
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,700
Al, I can do this.

105
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,800
I appreciate the offer,
but I can do this.

106
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,600
No. I know you can.

107
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,100
You're worried
about me. I get it.

108
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,700
<i>And I appreciate it, but
I'll be fine. I am fine.</i>

109
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,000
You know, I think
they're right.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,500
Maybe I went back
to work too soon,

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,600
so if they want me to go talk to this guy,
I'm happy to go talk to this guy.

112
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,200
Besides, isn't today
closing arguments?

113
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
It's not like I'm
actually in the courtroom.

114
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,200
Devalos just likes to have me
around the office,

115
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,000
just hanging around
in case he needs something.

116
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,000
Trust me, he won't
even notice if I'm not there.

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,900
It's okay.

118
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,900
Be there. I'll be fine.

119
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,400
<i>What does
"circumstantial" mean?</i>

120
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,800
The defense will try to attack the people's case
as "circumstantial."

121
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,400
They want you to assume

122
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,700
that "circumstantial" and "not
guilty" are one and the same.

123
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,400
They are not. You know this.

124
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,600
Your common sense
will tell you this--

125
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,100
your common sense in combination with
the testimony you've heard in this courtroom.

126
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,400
So let's review that testimony.

127
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,300
You've heard
from Walter Paxton's bookies

128
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,900
and business associates.

129
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,600
They've testified to his lies,

130
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,100
his history
of stealing from his wife

131
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,400
and his escalating
gambling debts.

132
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,800
You've heard from Natalie
Paxton's accountants,

133
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,400
how they had recently
informed Mr. Paxton

134
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,300
that he was about to be cut off.

135
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,200
You've heard from a number of
matrimonial

136
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,200
and family attorneys testifying
to the iron-clad nature

137
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,800
of Walter and his late wife's
prenuptial agreement,

138
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,600
how anything other
than his wife's death

139
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,100
would leave him broke and
in debt to violent criminals.

140
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,500
And you've heard
a proprietor of a knife shop say

141
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
that the defendant
purchased a blade

142
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,500
that matches the incisions
on Natalie Paxton's body--

143
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:41,100
a knife that he cannot or
will not produce for this court.

144
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,300
You've heard about
the night of the killing.

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,700
The screaming fight
in the hotel room.

146
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,000
The defendant seen leaving
the lobby carrying a satchel.

147
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,800
The three subsequent hours for which the defendant
cannot account,

148
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,200
hours spent, he claims,
driving the streets in anger.

149
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,100
And it was during those hours,

150
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,100
that the defendant,
Walter Paxton,

151
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,100
would have you believe
that someone else

152
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,700
entered his hotel room,
someone else using Walter Paxton's key card,

153
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,100
Someone else with a knife
exactly like Walter Paxton's.

154
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,400
And once inside,

155
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,500
what did this someone else do?

156
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,200
Why, he decapitated Walter's
Paxton's wife, of course,

157
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,600
and kept her head as a souvenir!

158
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,100
Please, folks.

159
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,400
So what do we think?

160
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,000
I'd rather have a
knife or some DNA

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,700
or a fingerprint,
but failing that...

162
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,300
you were pretty
damn magnificent.

163
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,300
Ah. Terrific.

164
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,200
No, I'm here.

165
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,100
I'm not going anywhere.

166
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,400
Maybe just grab
a sandwich or something.

167
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,000
Okay.

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,400
See you then.

169
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,400
Can I help you?

170
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Yeah, I, um, I'm,
so sorry to bother you.

171
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,900
Do you happen to own a beige-colored
Volvo station wagon?

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,200
Parked on the ground floor of
the municipal garage out here?

173
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,700
<i>WOMAN:
I feel terrible.</i>

174
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,200
<i>I was in a rush because I got a message from
the DMV saying</i>

175
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,600
they were gonna
take away my license

176
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,800
if I didn't pay my
parking tickets and

177
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,200
I guess I didn't realize
how many I'd racked up

178
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,100
and how long they've been
unpaid for, 'cause, well,

179
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,300
I can't really do my job
without being able to drive.

180
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,900
So anyway, I was pulling in
and I must've misjudged

181
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,400
where your car was
because... smack.

182
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,300
You're being really nice
about this. Most people...

183
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,300
Well, most people wouldn't
be quite so nice.

184
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,800
Oh, I think you
have it backwards.

185
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,700
Most people wouldn't
come looking for me.

186
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,100
Most people wouldn't bother
to put a note on the car.

187
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,400
Really? You think?

188
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,200
You can't even
see it, can you?

189
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,900
See?

190
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,300
Smack.

191
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,500
That? I wouldn't even
have noticed it

192
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
if you didn't point it out.

193
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,700
This car's not
in pristine condition.

194
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,800
Well, all the same,
here is my information.

195
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,900
Get an estimate and
I'll pay to have it fixed.

196
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,700
Pay to have what fixed?

197
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,500
You know what?

198
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,700
Are you married?

199
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
You're married-- get your
husband to look at it.

200
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,100
If you do decide
to get it fixed,

201
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,700
then you've got
my name and number.

202
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,700
<i>Well, you are sweet but this
is completely unnecessary.</i>

203
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay. Well, um...

204
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,000
How about lunch then?

205
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,900
Excuse me?

206
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,700
Well, now I think that you think that I'm a nut or something.

207
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,000
I've bothered you,
I've wasted your time.

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,800
At least let me buy you lunch.

209
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,700
I don't think you're a nut,

210
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,200
but, honestly, uh, we're
in the middle of a trial.

211
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,700
My boss is kind
of counting on me to be in the office.

212
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,100
Well, how about tomorrow, then?

213
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,600
It'd make me feel better.

214
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,900
All right. You know what?

215
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,200
Forget that. The truth is,

216
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,500
it's completely
selfish on my part.

217
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm here for a couple of weeks.

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,800
I don't know that many people.

219
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,500
You seem nice.

220
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,300
Well, the thing is...

221
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't really know what
tomorrow's gonna hold.

222
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,100
Doesn't matter. I'll call you.

223
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,400
Okay, you win!

224
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,500
You're a nut!
I am!

225
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,000
You hear that?
That's your phone ringing.

226
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's me calling you right now.

227
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,500
It was nice meeting
you, uh, Debra.

228
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,800
(quietly):
I think.

229
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Lunch tomorrow. It's a date.

230
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,500
So what are you
so angry about?

231
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
It can't just be
coming here to see me.

232
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,300
Who said I'm angry?

233
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,800
Are you kidding?

234
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,600
It's pouring off you.

235
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,200
You're a walking
billboard for anger.

236
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,700
No, I think you're wrong.
I don't think I'm angry.

237
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,600
A little depressed, maybe.

238
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
I saw two coworkers
get shot and killed.

239
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,400
Call me crazy,
but I think that gives me the right
to be a little down.

240
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,600
Okay.

241
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,500
We'll... play it
your way-- depressed.

242
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,500
By the way, do you know
what depression is?

243
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,800
Why? Aren't you allowed to have it
even if you can't describe it?

244
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,800
No, I don't know
what it is.

245
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
I just know what
it feels like.

246
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
Well, let me tell you
about it, then.

247
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,600
In men, it's often a function
of un-channeled anger.

248
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,900
A sense of despair,
helplessness,

249
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,600
brought on by... situations
completely beyond our control.

250
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,300
You go to work.

251
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,100
You like going to work;
it fulfills you.

252
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,700
You support your family,

253
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,400
hold up that end of the bargain
you have with society--

254
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,500
as a father, as a husband,
as a contributor,

255
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,300
as a breadwinner.

256
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,400
Work is safe-- you know
what's expected of you,

257
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,200
and for the most part,
you can deliver.

258
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,800
And then, one day,
someone shows up with a gun,

259
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,100
and all the rules change.

260
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,600
Not going to work
means, possibly,

261
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,800
potentially putting
your life on the line.

262
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,900
A person has a right
to get mad about that.

263
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
About the deal
changing like that.

264
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,000
Thank you both
for making time.

265
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,700
It's all right--
everyone's pretty much gone.

266
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,400
Please.

267
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,500
That was, uh, quite
a closing argument.

268
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,400
I agree-- so shouldn't you
be home preparing yours?

269
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,600
What can we do for you,
counselor?

270
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,900
Given the events of the day,
I'd be willing to try

271
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,900
and convince my client that
it might be to his advantage

272
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,300
to accept a plea
of murder two.

273
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,700
I'd be looking for 25 years
with time served,

274
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,700
and a guarantee that my
client would be eligible
for parole in 12 years.

275
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,900
Think about it.

276
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,700
Get back to me.

277
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,200
The man chopped
his wife's head off.

278
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,600
It's a bird in the hand,
Manuel-- take it,

279
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,200
and tomorrow morning
it's over.

280
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,200
He's behind bars,
and you're all over the news as
a winning D.A.

281
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,000
You know what?

282
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,200
You amaze me--
not two minutes ago,

283
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,800
you were sitting there
talking about what a powerful and stirirring
closing argument it was.

284
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,300
And it was, but the case
is circumstantial.

285
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,100
I can't be certain he did it,
and neither can you.

286
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,900
And I just worry that when that
jury gets behind closed doors,

287
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,900
they just might say the
same thing to themselves.

288
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,200
It's a trial, Manuel--
anything can happen.

289
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,800
Let me know
what you decide.

290
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,200
I will call you

291
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
when I've reached a decision!

292
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,300
She wants to make a deal,
doesn't she?

293
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Alison, I'm sorry,
I thought you were...

294
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,300
What did she offer?

295
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,900
(sighs):
Murder two.

296
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,200
25 years, eligibility
for parole in 12.

297
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,100
The truth is,
I should take it--

298
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,700
<i>the case is circumstantial.</i>

299
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,300
The jury'll get
hung up again,

300
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,400
and then we'll be
right back where we started.

301
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,600
Maybe it doesn't matter.

302
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,200
I dream the same
dream every night,

303
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,500
and there is nothing
circumstantial about it.

304
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
There's nothing
equivocal about it.

305
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,900
He sneaks up behind her
like a coward.

306
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,200
You should see his face--

307
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,500
the smug pleasure
he takes in it.

308
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,200
Her life is gone!

309
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,900
I'm not just talking about
the years ahead of her,

310
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,600
I'm talking about the ones
she already lived.

311
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,700
Everything that she did,
everything she accomplished,

312
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,400
it's all reduced to:
"She's the woman who got her head cut off."

313
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,800
And he's gonna get 12 years?

314
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,800
That's not justice!

315
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,300
That's some kind of
perverse expedience!

316
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,800
Well, don't worry about it.

317
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,800
We're not gonna do
expedience today.

318
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,500
We're gonna finish
trying this case.

319
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,300
We're gonna trust the jury.

320
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,400
Good

321
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,300
What, that's it?
That's it.

322
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,000
<i>But that's nothing--
that's less than nothing.</i>

323
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
<i>I know-- that's what I thought.</i>

324
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,600
So, what do you think--

325
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,700
do I even bother
getting an estimate?

326
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,000
For a ding that small?

327
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Yeah, you're right,
it's crazy.

328
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,400
She wants to have lunch.

329
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,200
I'm sorry. Who's that?

330
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,200
The woman who hit my car;
she wants to have lunch.

331
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,700
I might do it, too.

332
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,700
Mm. Pretty risky--
eating...

333
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,000
with another person...

334
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,800
in public.

335
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,700
Don't joke.

336
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,200
It's hard for me.

337
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,200
I don't have many friends.

338
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,000
When I meet people--
I can't explain it--

339
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,300
I don't know,
I immediately know too much.

340
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,900
Makes it hard.

341
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,200
So, what is it about
this one, then?

342
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,600
She was nice.

343
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,700
It was nice of her to come
and find me, and she was funny.

344
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,100
Besides, she's only in town
for a couple of weeks,

345
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,000
so if I start sensing things
that I don't like, I...

346
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,500
So, how was therapy?
How was the therapist?

347
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,200
Oh, he said I was angry.

348
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,100
Oh, yeah?
What did you make of that?

349
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,400
It pissed me off.

350
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,300
<i>All rise for the Honorable
Judge Arthur Brock.</i>

351
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,100
This Criminal Court of Mariposa County
is now in session,

352
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,300
the Honorable
Judge Arthur Brock presiding.

353
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,100
You may be seated.

354
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,600
The court will now continue
to hear closing ar...

355
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,600
The defendant may be seated.

356
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,700
Your Honor,
may I address the bench?

357
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,600
Walter, what are you...

358
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,300
Counsel, what is
your client doing?

359
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,700
I wish to dismiss my attorney,
Your Honor.

360
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,000
Walter, sit down!

361
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,100
Excuse me?

362
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,700
Your Honor,
it has just come to my attention

363
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,700
that my counsel attempted to
make a deal with the prosecution.

364
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,000
She did this
behind my back

365
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,600
(crowd murmuring)
to put me in prison for 25 years!

366
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,600
All right...

367
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,400
all right,
everybody settle down.

368
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,100
Your Honor, this is clearly
a cheap theatrical stunt

369
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,300
to sway the jury's
sympathies.

370
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,300
<i>Mr. Paxton, counsels,
approach the bench, please, now.</i>

371
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,200
Your Honor, I don't know what...
Your Honor, this is not a ploy--

372
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
I just found out about this deal
four minutes ago,

373
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,100
and now I'm supposed to
let her speak for me?

374
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Mr. Paxton, let me save you
a lot of grief and time.

375
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,800
This is a boneheaded move;

376
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,700
you're facing the death penalty.

377
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,900
Your best strategy right now
is to walk back to that chair

378
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,300
with your tail between your legs

379
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,700
and let your counsel
do her work.

380
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,500
When she's already
tried to put me away?

381
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,700
Your Honor,I'm entitled to
the best defense available,

382
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,300
and right now I believe
I should speak for myself,

383
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,700
since I seem to be
the only one here

384
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,300
who believes
in my innoce...

385
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Did you try to cut a deal?

386
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,200
Of course I did, Your Honor--
it's my job

387
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,300
to present my client with all
the options available to him.

388
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,400
And you explained this to your client?
Yes, I did.

389
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,200
Mr. Devalos?

390
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,200
If the defendant wishes to make
his own closing argument,I have no objections,
Your Honor.

391
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,100
You know why he has
no objection?

392
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,800
Because you're handing him
the verdict.

393
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,100
Maybe. Maybe not.

394
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,200
Joe.

395
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,200
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

396
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,600
I am not an innocent man.

397
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,700
I broke the vows that I made
before God to my wife.

398
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,000
I lied, I stole,

399
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,900
I gave my wife every reason
to cut me off

400
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,700
and to leave our marriage.

401
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,300
But that is a...

402
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,900
far cry from
the almost unimaginable thing

403
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,900
that I am accused of today.

404
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I mean, ask yourselves,

405
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,500
what would it take for you to do
to another human being

406
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,500
what they accuse me of doing

407
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,800
Now,

408
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,400
it's true, they've proven
that I fought with my wife.

409
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,000
They've even proven that,
on occasion,

410
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,400
full of emotion,

411
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,100
I've said things I don't mean,

412
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,700
even wished for my wife's death.

413
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,300
But who amongst us hadn't had

414
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,700
an embarrassing public lapse
in judgment?

415
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,800
Or an emotional exchange
so filled with poison

416
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,300
that you prayed to God
you could take it back.

417
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
They say that...

418
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,800
I bought the knife that was used
to slay my Natalie.

419
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,000
I did buy a knife.

420
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,200
I lost it on a camping trip.

421
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,500
They say I...

422
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,900
left the hotel
carrying a satchel.

423
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,800
It's true.

424
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,900
It was full of clothes.

425
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,800
They say I drove off to...

426
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,500
dispose of my wife's head.

427
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,500
What I really did

428
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,500
was back away from an ugly fight
to cool off.

429
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,100
The truth is,
I did the right things.

430
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,600
But instead,

431
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,100
they're saying I did something

432
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,100
almost beyond
human comprehension.

433
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,600
So I beg you,

434
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,500
if you believe it's possible
that one,

435
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,100
just one of the things
that they say happen didn't,

436
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,700
you have to ask:

437
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,300
Did they really get
the right man?

438
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,300
Hey.

439
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,500
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

440
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,600
I may be getting a call
from work.

441
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,500
I should probably order, too.

442
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,400
I can't stay long.

443
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,700
Sure thing.
Uh...

444
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,100
Is this the same case
you were working on yesterday?

445
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,100
I'm guessing you're a lawyer.

446
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
Oh, no, I didn't actually
finish law school.

447
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,300
I work for the district
attorney, Manuel Devalos.

448
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,200
Sounds impressive.

449
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,400
It's just part-time.

450
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,300
I do a lot of consulting.

451
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,800
Jury selection,

452
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,200
witness preparation,
that sort of thing.

453
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
It's not that exciting.

454
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,100
Easy for you to say.

455
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,200
You don't sell pharmaceuticals
for a living.

456
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,200
Excuse me...
Pharmaceuticals, huh?

457
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,100
Yeah-- major boring,

458
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,600
but lucrative and fun

459
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,500
if you don't mind traveling
ten months a year.

460
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,900
I don't mind, but I think
my husband and three kids might complain.

461
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,200
Three kids? Boy, I can
barely keep my cat alive.

462
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,500
Excuse me. Uh...

463
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,000
So what's this case?

464
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,200
Uh, you're not from the area.

465
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,800
I don't know if you heard of it.

466
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,300
There's a guy named
Walter Paxton.

467
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,500
Chopped off his wife's head
and hid it somewhere.

468
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,600
Everybody's heard about it.

469
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,600
How does
someone do that?

470
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,500
And how do they stand up
in front of a jury

471
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,800
when they know they're guilty--when everybody knows
they're guilty-- and just lie?

472
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,600
You just hope that the jury
sees through it.

473
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,900
You just hope that you picked
the right jurors.

474
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,200
And that's where you come in?

475
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,400
That's where I come in.

476
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,300
Give me a second?

477
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,800
You know, I think I saw your
boss on the news the other night.

478
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,400
Yeah, hi.

479
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,600
Can you turn around a second?

480
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,100
Yeah, you see that woman waving?
(chuckles)

481
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,100
That's me. My friend and I would
really like to order,

482
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,500
so can you send the waiter over?

483
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,700
That'd be great.
Thanks.

484
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,600
So?

485
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,800
So what?

486
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,300
So...

487
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,000
what's it like working
for the D.A.?

488
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,300
Do you have any comments
about today's news?

489
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,500
I'm actually very encouraged
by today's decision.

490
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,900
But while we may all be talking
about my vindication...

491
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
What are you doing?

492
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Hi. Sorry, text message.

493
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,400
Someone from work.

494
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,200
Is everything okay?

495
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,900
Yeah, everything's fine.

496
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,400
I just... I couldn't sleep,
so I figured I'd do it now.

497
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,500
Come on.
Let's go back to bed.

498
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,200
Hello.

499
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,000
Mom, it's for you.

500
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,400
Hello.

501
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,100
Allison, it's Manuel.

502
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,300
Sorry to call so early,but I thought
you'd like to know the jury's in.

503
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,300
They have a verdict on Walter Paxton.

504
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,400
Has the jury reached a verdict?

505
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,200
We have, Your Honor.

506
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,300
<i>In the matter of ThePeople
v. Walter Paxton,</i>

507
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,300
we find the defendant
guilty of murder in the first degree.

508
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,900
Now all we need
to do is to convince a sentencing jury

509
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,700
that
Mr. Walter Paxton
deserves death

510
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,700
for what he did
to his wife.

511
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,900
Hear, hear.

512
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,400
Thank you for
the encouragement.

513
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,600
Oh...

514
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,700
Any time at all.

515
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,800
Wow.

516
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Look at what
you went and did.

517
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,500
Now, that is what I call
engineering.

518
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,600
Not bad, huh?

519
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,600
Not bad at all.

520
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,700
I'd get up and give you a hug,
but I am really, really tired.

521
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,800
I can't imagine why.

522
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,200
So this is the little fellow

523
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,300
who wouldn't let you drink
coffee these last few months.

524
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,000
I think he's gonna be a
tea drinker like Steven.

525
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,900
Speaking of
the proud papa,where is he?

526
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,900
I have a very cheap cigar
for him.

527
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,500
He went to the airport
to pick his folks up.

528
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,800
Did you manage to get back to
sleep last night?

529
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,700
I had no idea that I sent
a text so late.

530
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,600
No, it was fine.
I was fine.

531
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,600
Uh, no, I was actually glad
to get it.

532
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,800
I was happy to hear
that everything went well.

533
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,900
That you were well,
the baby was well.

534
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,100
Are you well?

535
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,900
Me? I'm excellent.

536
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,100
I'm absolutely excellent.

537
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,400
I have been seeing a therapist
that the company hired.

538
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,800
I'm actually supposed
to be in his office right now.

539
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,800
He's that good, huh?

540
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,400
(sighs):
I don't know.

541
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,200
Maybe I just went back
to work a little too soon.

542
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,100
Apparently I'm angry
or depressed or...

543
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,300
I just can't focus at work
or something.

544
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,800
Other than that...

545
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,400
How's your wife
doing with it?

546
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,600
How do you mean?

547
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,200
I've been horrible to Steven.

548
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,700
I'm angry with him
because he wasn't there,

549
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,200
like that was
a choice he made.

550
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,100
Thank God for hormones.

551
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,400
They've been getting
a lot of the blame lately.

552
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
You really don't
mind the texting?

553
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,600
I know I do it a lot,

554
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,900
but it... it really makes me
feel better.

555
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,100
I look forward to it.

556
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,500
Just wanted to remind you

557
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,000
it's time for the baby's
feeding, Mrs. Bell.

558
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Speaking of feeding,

559
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,100
I should probably go
get myself some lunch.

560
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,200
Um, yeah, congratulations again.

561
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,700
He's beautiful.

562
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,400
Uh, hey,

563
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,100
have you been getting, like,
hundreds of calls from that Cooper guy?

564
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,100
I'm sorry. Calls from who?

565
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,100
Okay, I guess it's just me then.

566
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,000
I thought it had something
to do with the incident,

567
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
but I guess not.

568
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,300
I'll just return one of them
and see what he wants.

569
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,600
Okay.

570
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,500
This was the scene at the
Phoenix courthouse earlier today,

571
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,000
just moments after Walter Paxton
was found guilty of murder

572
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,300
in the first degree.

573
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,800
Mr. Paxton, who was accused
of killing

574
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,000
and then decapitating
his wife Natalie

575
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,400
in their downtown hotel room...

576
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Will you shut
that off?

577
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,200
I've seen enough of
that man for a lifetime.

578
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,500
Sentencing is scheduled
to begin next week.

579
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,700
Kids down?

580
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,100
Yeah, and it
wasn't easy.

581
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,300
Bridgette kept trying
to say good night

582
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,500
at the exact same
time as I did,

583
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,700
so she could
jinx me.

584
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,300
Her own mother.

585
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,400
Breaks your heart,
doesn't it?

586
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,900
Mm!

587
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,200
What you doing?

588
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,900
I'm being proactive.

589
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,900
And what does that mean?

590
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,900
I miss my husband.

591
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,100
Well, that's silly.
He's here.

592
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,600
Then tell me about your day.

593
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,900
Tell me about therapy;
tell me what's going on.

594
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,100
Nothing's going on.

595
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,600
I didn't go to therapy.

596
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,000
I don't understand.

597
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,400
You want to go back
to work, don't you?

598
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,700
Isn't this the therapist that
the company's counting on

599
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,300
to tell them if you're
ready to go back or not?

600
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,400
I'll go tomorrow.

601
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,300
Then I'll go the day after.

602
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,300
He'll think that's progress.

603
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,800
He'll think he cured me.

604
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,000
And don't look at me like that.

605
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,900
I'm sorry.

606
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,000
I don't mean to upset you.

607
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,100
I really am feeling better;
I really will go tomorrow.

608
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,200
I love you so much, Joe.

609
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,700
I just want you
to be happy again.

610
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,400
I will be happy again.

611
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,800
I really will.

612
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,300
I'm sorry.

613
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,800
If you could please sign here
and initial here,

614
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,100
I'll have a bellman
bring your bags up to your room.

615
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,600
Excellent, Ms. Hensley.

616
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,800
Thank you for staying
at the Phoenix Hilton.

617
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,800
It's Scanlon.

618
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,200
Hey, it's 5:00 in the morning.

619
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
Allison?

620
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,100
This place is so familiar.

621
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,400
I hate to pull you two
out of bed, but, uh,

622
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,000
I thought you needed
to see this.

623
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,100
The, uh, victim's
name was Ramona...

624
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,100
...Hensley.
...Hensley.

625
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,900
Honestly, that's all
I have is a name.

626
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,300
33 years old.

627
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,100
Insurance broker in town
for a convention.

628
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,000
No sign of a break-in,

629
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,400
so her killer
either had a key

630
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,100
or he convinced her
to let him in.

631
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,000
It appears he attacked her
in the bathroom here.

632
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,400
Got her in the bathtub.

633
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,000
Decapitated her and...

634
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,100
Wait a second--
did you say decapitated her?

635
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,200
Lee, what are you being
so cryptic about here?

636
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,000
What are we looking at,

637
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,200
some sort
of Paxton copycat killing?

638
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,500
That's what I thought
when they first called me.

639
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,900
Ugh! What's that smell?

640
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,600
Formaldehyde.

641
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,000
The coroner hasn't
weighed in yet,

642
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,500
but we think that's what he used
to preserve the head.

643
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,800
Preserve the head? I don't understand.

644
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,100
Didn't you say this killing
occurred hours ago?

645
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,300
I'm not talking
about Ramona Hensley's head.

646
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,900
Oh, my God.

647
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,100
Is that...?

648
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,700
ALLISON:
Natalie Paxton.

649
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,700
It's Natalie Paxton's head

650
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,100
on Ramona Hensley's body.

651
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,300
Okay.

652
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,100
Deputy Mayor says hello.

653
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,900
City Hall's already being
inundated with

654
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,900
calls from the press,
from outraged citizens,

655
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,600
people calling for
the immediate release
of Walter Paxton.

656
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,500
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what to say.

657
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,400
There's nothing to say.

658
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,500
I chose to prosecute this case.

659
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,900
There's nothing for you
to feel badly about.

660
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,900
That's not true.

661
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,500
You told me yourself-- I
encouraged you to go for broke.

662
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,100
And I swear, I never would have

663
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,500
if I hadn't seen him
do it myself...

664
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
night after night.

665
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,700
I don't know how
I could've been so wrong.

666
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,800
Wait a second.

667
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,300
She never actually saw him.

668
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,000
Natalie never actually saw who her killer was.

669
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,500
He came up from behind her.

670
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,400
What are you
talking about?
In my dream.

671
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,700
She must have died
thinking he did it.

672
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,000
She was so angry at him
at the time,

673
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,800
so hurt by all that he'd done.

674
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,100
That's why she sent me
those dreams.

675
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,700
She thought he did it.

676
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,400
She never actually saw Walter,

677
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,800
or whoever it was
who really did it.

678
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Okay.

679
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,000
Well, of course.

680
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,700
You're right, who cares?

681
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,900
Doesn't really change anything.

682
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,700
Yeah.

683
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,500
We have no comment
at this time.

684
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,800
You just tell
anyone who calls

685
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,600
that we're still putting
together a statement

686
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,900
and as soon as
it's ready,

687
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,000
we'll put it out to
the appropriate media outlets.

688
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,900
Thanks.

689
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,900
Joe Dubois.

690
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,800
Mr. Dubois?

691
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,400
Am I catching you at a bad time?

692
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,900
I'm sorry,
who am I speaking with?

693
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,400
My name is Conroy.
Cooper Conroy.

694
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,900
I'm an attorney, Mr. Dubois.

695
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,400
Can you talk for a moment?

696
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,300
I'm actually about to head off
to the doctor.

697
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,700
All I'm looking for
is an appointment, Mr. Dubois,

698
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,200
an opportunity
to sit down and talk.

699
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,700
Talk? About what?

700
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,100
About millions of dollars
I believe you're entitled to.

701
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,000
Mr. Dubois? Did you hear me?

702
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,900
I... I really, uh, I really
have to go to the doctor.

703
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,700
Okay, that's fine.

704
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,700
You have my number
on your cell phone now.

705
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,700
So I'm going to wait
for you to call me.

706
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,600
I just need an hour, Mr. Dubois.

707
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,800
And I do believe you'll find
what I have to say...

708
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,600
Do you have any comments
about today's news?

709
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,600
I'm actually very encouraged
by today's decision.

710
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,500
But while we may all
be talking about

711
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,300
my vindication and release,

712
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,200
we shouldn't lose sight
of the fact

713
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,200
that this isn't just
about the misguided prosecution

714
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,800
of an innocent man.

715
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,700
The real victims of this tragedy
have yet to be avenged.

716
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,600
And while I may be thrilled
to be out of jail,

717
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,300
nothing that happened
in there today is going to bring
my Natalie back.

718
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,300
And that's why...
(TV clicks off)

719
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,600
Hello?

720
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,000
Are you avoiding me?

721
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,200
I left you, like, 100 messages.

722
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,300
Yeah.

723
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,700
It's just been kind of
a complicated day around here.

724
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,100
You think I don't know that.

725
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,900
You think I don't
watch the news.

726
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,300
That's why I was calling you.

727
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,800
I was concerned about you.

728
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Well, I'm fine.

729
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,500
Okay.

730
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,400
'Cause I was just sitting here
in my friendly hotel bar

731
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,900
thinking you might need someone
to talk to about it all.

732
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,500
You are very sweet.

733
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,600
But then I forgot you have
hubby for that, don't you?

734
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,100
Well, actually...

735
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,500
hubby hasn't been
all that talkative lately.

736
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,000
Well, then get your ass down here-- I'm buying.

737
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,500
Oh, God, it's the middle
of the week.

738
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,100
We're all kind of in bed mode
around here.

739
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,600
<i>Entrez vous.</i>

740
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,400
I don't think I've ever
seen you take a bath before.

741
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,000
Not since I was nine, maybe.

742
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,700
I don't know,
I just wanted to think.

743
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,700
I understand.

744
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,500
You know that woman, Debra,
the woman who hit my car?

745
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,700
She just called, she wanted
to know if we could meet,

746
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,700
maybe get a drink.

747
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,100
I told her it was late.

748
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,700
Ah, the girls are down.

749
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,500
I'm okay in here.

750
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,100
Okay.

751
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,200
Wow, I'm kind of
surprised.

752
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,400
Feels kind of weird
going without you.

753
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,900
Don't be silly.

754
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,800
Okay.
Well, if you're sure.

755
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,100
Yeah.

756
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,700
I mean, it's just for
a couple hours, right?

757
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,500
If that.
Okay.

758
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Oh, that's okay.

759
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,900
I got it.

760
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,300
Are you expecting a call
tonight?

761
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,800
Or maybe a text?

762
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,000
It's not
what you think.
Well, good.

763
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,900
'Cause what I'm
thinking is not good.

764
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,500
hey

765
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,400
sorry

766
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,600
I feel so badly for you.

767
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,400
I feel so badly for your boss.

768
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,800
They're just destroying
him on television.

769
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,300
I know, I can't help but
think a lot of that's my fault.

770
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,000
How do you mean?

771
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,700
Before Paxton fired
his lawyer, she came to us,

772
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,900
she wanted to make a deal.

773
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,500
25 years, possibility
of parole after 12.

774
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,400
A lot of people thought
my boss should consider it,

775
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,500
but I kind of
convinced him not to.

776
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,100
Wow, sounds like you have
a lot of sway over your boss.

777
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,000
Well, even if it's true,

778
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,600
I don't see how that
makes you responsible.

779
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,000
Paxton has never wavered.

780
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,900
He's always insisted
he was innocent.

781
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,800
It seems pretty obvious he would
never have agreed to a deal.

782
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,100
I don't know.

783
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,200
Maybe if I hadn't
said anything.

784
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,600
If we'd just entertained
the possibility;

785
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,300
if the two lawyers
had started talking,

786
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,400
the judge most
certainly would have suspended the trial
a couple of days

787
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,400
and the other body
would have shown up.

788
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,600
Paxton would have
never been convicted.

789
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
Your boss really
listens to you, huh?

790
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,100
A lot of times, yeah.

791
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,400
You and he...

792
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,900
Oh, God, no! No.

793
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,000
No, I'm married.

794
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,800
I love my husband.
I'm sorry.

795
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,300
I mean, no offense, but why
does even care what you think?

796
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,100
I'm sorry, am I being too nosy?

797
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,500
I just...

798
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,500
I love this stuff.

799
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,800
I'm kind of a
Court TV junkie.

800
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,600
I think you have
the coolest job.

801
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,300
So what made you
change your mind?

802
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,600
First, you said you
weren't coming tonight

803
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,400
and you called back
and said you were.

804
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,600
I don't know.

805
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,300
My husband's kind of
going through something.

806
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,000
I guess we both thought

807
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,200
he could use a little
time to himself.

808
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,000
I never do this.

809
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,600
Go out by myself.

810
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,700
You don't have
any friends?

811
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,500
Yeah.

812
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
No.

813
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,900
I have work friends
and my husband...

814
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,800
Sure, I have friends--
everybody has friends.

815
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,500
You ask a lot of questions,
you know that?

816
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,500
I know; everyone says
that-- it's horrible.

817
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,900
And I think it's
my way of avoiding
answering any questions.

818
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,300
Oh, really?
I'm not answering that.

819
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,100
I'm not answering that either.

820
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,400
How about another drink?
I'm buying.

821
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,200
You can't fool me.

822
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,700
I'm not answering
that either.

823
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,700
OFFICER:
Detective.

824
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
So this is where
all the action is.

825
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,100
Well, now we know where the head
of the third victim ended up.

826
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,000
So who does the body
belong to?

827
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,400
There's some discrepancy
about the name,

828
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,500
but I can show you her
driver's license photo.

829
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:23,600
