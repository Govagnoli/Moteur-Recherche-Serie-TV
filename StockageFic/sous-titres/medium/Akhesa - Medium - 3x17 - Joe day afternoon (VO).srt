00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,300
<i>ALLISON:
Dread becomes unannounced and then consumes our feelings</i>

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,000
<i>with its irrational
sense of doom.</i>

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,300
<i>Have you ever had
the feeling of dread?</i>

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,100
<i>I'm not talking about fear.</i>

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,200
<i>Fear is immediate.</i>

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,100
<i>Fear is what kicks in when you're
confronted with danger</i>

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,200
<i>A mugger with a gun.</i>

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,400
<i>A stranger in your house.</i>

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,800
<i>I'm talking about dread.</i>

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,500
<i>Dread is persistent.</i>

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,200
<i>It gnaws at you.</i>

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,900
<i>You can't ignore it.</i>

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,400
<i>It just won't go away.</i>

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,600
<i>Because that's what dread is.</i>

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,900
<i>It's worrying about something
you can't do anything about.</i>

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,800
<i>Dread can affect your job,</i>

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>your home, alter your entire
personality.</i>

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,300
Hey, sorry to wake you.

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,000
I felt funny leaving
without saying good-bye.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,800
It's so early.
I know.

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,900
My ride said he needed
to get in before everybody else.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,300
Your ride?
Yeah.
Remember?

23
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,300
I dropped my car off at the shop
on the way home last night.

24
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,700
Oh, right.

25
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,400
I thought I was driving you.

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,100
No, I told you.

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,400
I looked through
the company directory and I made

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,100
some phone calls-- I got a guy
from work to take me.

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,500
What's with the long face?

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,600
I don't know.
Funny feeling, like...

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,700
Like you're...
I'm supposed to drive you or...

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,100
Maybe you're not
supposed to go at all.

33
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,500
You hear that?

34
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,700
Maybe it's the world's
way of telling us

35
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,800
to stay in bed, just...

36
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,500
let a day go by without us.

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,900
I'll let you explain
that to my bosses.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,600
Today's the monthly project
management meeting.

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,700
But I'm sure they'd be happy
to call it on account of rain.

40
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,000
That's my ride.
Are you sure

41
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,500
you don't want
me to drive you?

42
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,500
I have a funny feeling.
No, it's fine. Really.

43
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,300
If you want to do
something for me,

44
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,400
if it clears, maybe you can
swing by the dry cleaners

45
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,100
and pick up my shirts.

46
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,600
That would be...
(doorbell rings)

47
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,000
Can you grab that?
I'm just going to get my bag.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,900
Hi, uh, I'm Bruce.
I'm here for Joe.

49
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,800
Oh, yeah. Come in, come in.

50
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,900
I'm Allison, I'm Joe's wife.

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,100
Hope you brought your ark.

52
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,300
Um, well, let me just...

53
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,100
Uh, check on Joe,
see what he's up to.

54
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,000
Hey, sorry to wake you, but...

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,900
You felt funny leaving
without saying good-bye.

56
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,600
Yeah.

57
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,000
I need you to say home.

58
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,000
Honey, that's my ride.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,700
No, I mean it.
I really need you to stay home.

60
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,600
Okay. Can you tell me why?

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,400
No. A feeling.

62
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,100
Maybe it's the rain.

63
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,100
Maybe it's the thunder.

64
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,800
Okay, well, the rain
is going to stop,

65
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,300
and the thunder will pass.

66
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,600
I really need to go to work.

67
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,400
The kids really need to go
to school, not to mention...

68
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,900
I know. Your shirts,
the cleaners...

69
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,800
Big meeting. Wish me luck.

70
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,200
Luck...

Joe Day Afternoon

73
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,600
(thunder clapping)
Ariel!

74
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm right here.

75
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,800
Today's going to be
a terrible day.

76
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,200
What makes you say that?

77
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't know.
Just a feeling I have.

78
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,000
I mean, look out the window,
it's depressing.

79
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,300
I can't do anything
with my hair.

80
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,900
It's like I know something
bad's going to happen.

81
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,700
I don't know when
and I don't know where.

82
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,100
I kind of want
to crawl back into bed

83
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,700
and wait until the day is over.

84
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,100
Well, don't say that.

85
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,900
You know,
the rain's going to stop.

86
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,700
The thunder's going to pass.

87
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,200
How do you know?

88
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,300
Daddy told me.

89
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,200
Appreciate you doing this.

90
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,100
Not a problem.

91
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,400
No, I mean, really.

92
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,600
I-I've seen you in
these monthly meetings

93
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,800
for a couple years
and I realize,

94
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,600
you know, we don't
know each other and I...

95
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,400
I appreciate you going out
of your way to pick me up.

96
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,300
Don't worry about it.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,900
I forgot my, uh, pass.

98
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,600
Do you-- do you have yours?

99
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,600
Thanks.

100
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,000
<i>DEVALOS:
There's no question about it.</i>

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,300
A predominantly
female jury

102
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,100
is going to work
against us in this case.

103
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,700
I just wish I felt
more certain

104
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,000
about some of the men
in the jury pool.

105
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,000
Have you had a chance
to look at any of their files?

106
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,300
Allison?

107
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,300
Thought we lost you there
for a moment.

108
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,900
Oh, no, my... It's my mind.

109
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,900
I just... can't focus
this morning.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
Something wrong?

111
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,000
No, I'm just busy

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,800
worrying about things
I can't do anything about.

113
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,600
The worst thing is,
I'm not even certain

114
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,300
what those things are.

115
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,100
Oh, look, it stopped raining.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,500
The sun came out.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Just like Joe said it would.

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,400
Listen, I'm due in court
in a few minutes.

119
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,800
Why don't we reconvene
this afternoon

120
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,100
when heads and schedules
are a bit clearer?

121
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,900
<i>(phone ringing)
WOMAN:
Oh, my gosh.</i>

122
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,700
How is this possible?

123
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,400
This baby does not like coffee.

124
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,200
What do you mean?

125
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,000
Every time I take a sip

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,600
before it even gets
halfway down

127
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,300
the little bugger
sends it gushing up

128
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,800
back through my throat again.

129
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,400
Sounds pleasant.

130
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,100
But I love coffee.

131
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,000
Maybe it's not my baby.

132
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
That doesn't seem very likely.

133
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,700
(door opening)
MAN:
Morning everybody.

134
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,200
Where are the boys
from Avionics?

135
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,600
Uh, meeting
with a client in Peru.

136
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
Peru? And Systems?

137
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,400
I think they went with.

138
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,600
Of course.

139
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,300
Well, then this
shouldn't take long.

140
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,900
Bruce?

141
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,400
Bruce?

142
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,900
Mr. Kravitz.

143
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,500
Bruce, what are you doing here?

144
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,600
Well...
(clears throat)

145
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,000
This is the monthly
Project Management meeting.

146
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,700
I manage...

147
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,800
Satellite Telemetry Systems.

148
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,900
I've been coming to this
meeting for three years.

149
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,900
Is... I'm sorry,
is there a problem?

150
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,200
Well, a little one.

151
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,000
You are no longer

152
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,400
the manager of
all the satellite telemetry systems.

153
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,500
In fact, you no
longer work here.

154
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,100
Were you not released from
your contract last week?

155
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,300
Did you not surrender
your keys? Your computer?

156
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Your pass? How the hell
did you get in here?

157
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,300
Uh, we rode in together.

158
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,000
I see.

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,100
Okay.

160
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,100
Bruce, what are we doing?

161
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Well, Mr. Kravitz, um...

162
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,200
we're offering you, uh,
the opportunity of a lifetime.

163
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,300
We're, uh...

164
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,300
giving you a chance
to reconsider.

165
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,000
But there's nothing
to reconsider, Bruce.

166
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,700
Well, I think there is,
Mr. Kravitz.

167
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,800
There really were
no grounds to fire me.

168
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,500
Really? Is that the way
you look at it?

169
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,200
Am I mistaken?

170
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
The Manzee Communications
satellite,

171
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,500
a $60 million satellite,
a satellite on which you were responsible
for the telemetry systems,

172
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,300
didn't that satellite
just fall out of the sky

173
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,800
over Saudi Arabia last month?

174
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,400
Mr. Kravitz...

175
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,700
I came to you

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
six weeks
before launch,

177
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,600
I told you that
we weren't ready.

178
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,100
I told you that that satellite
wasn't going to stay up there.

179
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,000
I told you that we needed 90 more days
of programming time.

180
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,700
I told you that we needed
another $750,000.

181
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,600
And I explained to you
that we didn't have it.

182
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Your job was
to make it work within the resources
you were given!

183
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,400
You failed,
you were dismissed.

184
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,200
Do you know something?
I think this is all the reconsidering we're
going to do on this.

185
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,900
I'm going to ask
you to leave now.

186
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,900
If you don't leave
within ten seconds,

187
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,700
I'm going to call
Security to assist you, Bruce.

188
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,600
Okay, well...

189
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,300
Here's where we disagree.

190
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,600
Because, uh...

191
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,000
I think we do have more...

192
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,900
to talk about.

193
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,900
Beautiful day.
Beautiful day.

194
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,800
Yes, beautiful day, yes.

195
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,600
Oh, no.

196
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,800
(voice mail):
Hi, you've reached Joe Dubois.

197
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Sorry I'm not around
to take your call,

198
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,000
but leave your name and number,
and I'll get back to you as quickly as I can.
(beeps)

199
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,300
Hey, it's me.

200
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm sorry, I suddenly got
that feeling again...

201
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,400
REPORTER (on TV):
We interrupt our current program
to bring you breaking news.

202
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,300
Gunshots have been reportedly
fired inside the offices

203
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,500
Are you done, Ariel?

204
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
I need to call my mom.

205
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,500
What are you talking about?
Are you ill?

206
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,600
It's hard to describe.

207
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,200
It's just... I really need
to call my mom.

208
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,400
Are you sure
this isn't something the nurse can
help you with?

209
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,500
All right, give me your test
and I'll write you a pass to the principal's.

210
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,900
Come on, move!

211
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,300
Hi, you've reached Joe DuBois.

212
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,400
Sorry I'm not around...

213
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,300
I guess everybody heard
that shot.

214
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,100
They're evacuating the building.

215
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,800
Everyone's outside already.

216
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,700
Please be seated.

217
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,500
Excellent, our tax dollars at work.

218
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,400
Okay, so now we've shot
a hole in the ceiling,

219
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,200
we've all surrendered our
cell phones, where to next?

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,900
I'd like to move this along--
I have desk full of work

221
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,400
and the wife has tickets
to the theater tonight.

222
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,600
Is this a joke to you?
Does this amuse you?

223
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,700
I'm sorry-- do you sense
amusement here, Bruce?

224
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,600
Well, forgive me.

225
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,100
Whatever I've done
to give that impression,

226
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,800
I apologize. I am not amused.

227
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,200
Not in the least.

228
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,100
A little bored,

229
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,600
a little peeved.

230
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,900
Wouldn't want to be sitting
beneath that hole

231
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,200
if the rains starts up again,
but amused? I think not.

232
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,400
So what say
we get to it?

233
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,000
What's your end game?
What do you want?!

234
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,700
I told you.

235
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,600
I told you what I want,
Mr. Kravitz.

236
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,800
I want my job back,
my pension, my health benefits,

237
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,500
my life insurance.

238
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,800
I want it to be as though
last week never happened.

239
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,200
Little late for that,
don't you think?

240
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,300
Well, wait a second.

241
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Let's talk about it.

242
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,000
Is it too late?

243
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,100
If nobody's hurt,

244
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,700
everybody's fine.

245
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah, there's a hole
in the ceiling,

246
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,200
but that can be fixed.

247
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,900
So what about his job?

248
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,900
Is there something,
anything to talk about here?

249
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,800
Are you serious?

250
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,000
First of all, I'm not
agreeing to anything

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,100
when there's a gun
pointed at me.

252
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,500
Well, he makes
a good point, Bruce.

253
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,300
What's it gonna take to get you
to put that gun away?

254
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,900
There's really nothing
to talk about until you do.

255
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
All right, how about Melinda?

256
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,000
How about you let her
go out the door and down the stairs?

257
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,600
All the stress is not
good for her or her baby.

258
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,600
No one's going anywhere.

259
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Why don't you have a seat, Joe?

260
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,400
The man has spoken.

261
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,900
We'd all better do
as he says or who knows?

262
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,800
He may take his pop gun

263
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,400
and put another
hole in the plaster.

264
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,900
Mr. Kravitz...
Please.
You know what?

265
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,300
I've had about as much of this
as I care to.

266
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,800
If he were gonna
do something,he'd have done
it by now.

267
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,200
He's got one gun.

268
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,100
Who knows how many bullets?
He's already wasted one.

269
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,100
Look at him.

270
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,300
Does he threaten you?

271
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,600
He doesn't threaten me.

272
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,100
In fact, you know
what I'm gonna do?

273
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm leaving.

274
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,900
I'm gonna walk out
that door right now

275
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
and let's see if he
tries to stop me.

276
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,700
I may have spoken
a bit precipitously.

277
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,800
Joe!

278
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,400
Joe Dubois?!

279
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,600
Has anyone seen
Joe DuBois?! Joe!

280
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
Looking for somebody?

281
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,300
My husband. He works here.

282
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,500
He's not answer his cell phone.

283
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,900
I don't see him anywhere.

284
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,000
Do you know what's going on?

285
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,900
Who's still in there?

286
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,200
We're trying
to figure that out.

287
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,600
Actually, if you give
me his name,

288
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,000
we'll have people
look out for him.

289
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,500
Joe DuBois. D-U-B-O-I-S

290
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,700
REPORTER:
A shot or shots were fired
at Aerodytech.

291
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,600
As you can see from the shot
from our Action News chopper,

292
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,800
(knocking)
police are starting
to gather up...

293
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,300
I'm sorry to bother you,
Principal Philips,

294
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,800
but I need to call my mom

295
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,300
and they said I couldn't use the
phone without your permission.

296
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,800
What's so urgent it can't wait
till school's out, Ariel?

297
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,500
It's just... I have this
really bad feeling.

298
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,100
Anything you want to talk
to me about?

299
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,700
No.

300
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,900
Ariel, what do you think
your mom can do

301
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,500
to make that feeling go away?

302
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,400
I don't know.

303
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,200
Maybe say something.

304
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,800
I'm gonna say no, Ariel.

305
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,400
because you're in
the eighth grade,

306
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,000
and by the time
we get to the eighth grade,

307
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,300
even though we have
bad feelings,

308
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,500
we should be able
to get through the day

309
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,300
without talking
to our moms and dads.

310
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,300
I'm gonna ask you to go back
to your classroom

311
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,200
and whatever feelings you have,

312
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,500
they're just gonna have to wait
until the end of the day, okay?

313
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,400
Yeah.

314
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,700
MAN:
This way,
Mr. District Attorney.

315
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,600
Mr. District Attorney!

316
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,700
Allison, what
are you doing here?

317
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,600
My husband works here.

318
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,300
Can you help me
find out if he's all right?

319
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
You're just in time.

320
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,900
We're just about
to try and make contact.

321
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,500
Do you know where
he is, who he is?

322
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,200
Basically,

323
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,100
we're just dialing extensions until somebody picks up.

324
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,800
Checking your e-mail?

325
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,900
Here's the thing: I can't
give you your job back.

326
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,300
That ship has left the dock,
but it's not too late.

327
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,300
You let us walk out
of here, all of us,

328
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,600
and we'll come up
with a story.

329
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,200
We're all engineers,

330
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
we're in this room
testing some new polymer

331
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,500
and we got the idea
to fire a gun at it.

332
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,700
And you're here 'cause this
used to be your project.

333
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,300
Anyway, this new polymer, it's
supposed to be bulletproof,

334
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,800
so we shot at it to test it.

335
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,800
Didn't even realize
the building had
been evacuated.

336
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,400
That's the story and
we all stick with it.

337
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,300
I write you a glowing
letter of recommendation

338
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,000
and six months from now

339
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
you have a better job
than you ever had here.

340
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,800
Is anyone else hot?

341
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,700
I-I'm hot.

342
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,500
I turned the air off.

343
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,100
It's one of the first things
they do when they think they've got a hostage situation
on their hands.

344
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,100
Aaron,
I want you to go over to the window
and lower the blinds.

345
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,500
Would you do that
for me, please?

346
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,800
I think it'll bring down
the heat a little bit.

347
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,000
Oh, Aaron,

348
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,800
put your hands on your head
on the way over there

349
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,300
so that they know
you're not armed.

350
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,700
You know, I don't want
you to get shot by accident.

351
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,900
Joe, will you answer that
for me, please?

352
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,900
Hello?

353
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,000
They want
to speak with you.

354
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,400
Tell them I'm not actually
taking calls right now.

355
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,100
He won't come to the phone.

356
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,500
MAN:
Can you tell me
his name?

357
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,800
His name?

358
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,800
He'd rather I didn't say.

359
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,200
Us? There are
four of us plus him.

360
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,100
Our names?

361
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,800
Let's not make it
too easy for them.

362
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,500
Again, he'd rather I didn't say.

363
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,400
Yes, he's armed.

364
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,200
No, he hasn't, not yet.

365
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,400
What? He hasn't what?

366
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,300
Hurt anyone.

367
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,300
They're asking
if you've hurt anyone.

368
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,600
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa!

369
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,000
You can hang up
the phone now, Joe.

370
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,000
They know everything
they need to know.

371
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,800
Hey!
What's going on in there?

372
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,200
We heard gunshots.

373
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,200
Hello?

374
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,100
He's gone.

375
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,900
Do we know where he is?
We made contact through

376
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,600
an extension in the
west conference center.

377
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,300
Well, then he's practically
friends and family.

378
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,200
Let's call him back.

379
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,900
Um...

380
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,800
Okay, well, who wants
to make sure Aaron's dead

381
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,600
and who wants to pick up the
phone so that it stops ringing?

382
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Melinda, why don't you check his pulse,
and, Mr. Kravitz,
(ringing)

383
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,400
you know how
to work a phone,

384
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,900
don't you?

385
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,700
Now hang it up.

386
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,600
And when they call
back in 30 seconds,

387
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,000
just do it again
and keep doing it

388
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,200
until they get the idea
to stop calling me.

389
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,400
Okay, um... Joe?

390
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,500
I'm going to need you
over here, please.

391
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,800
There's no pulse.

392
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,100
I don't feel any pulse.

393
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,200
He has-- He has
no pulse.

394
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,100
Have a seat.

395
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,400
Okay, Joe, um...
(clears throat)

396
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,500
I'm going to need you to sign
into your Aerodytech account.

397
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,400
He just keeps hanging up.

398
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,500
Oh, my God.

399
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,100
What?

400
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,800
Let's step outside.

401
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,000
You see something
there, don't you?

402
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,300
It's a man Joe works with.

403
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,600
The fact that you're seeing
him and I'm not means...

404
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Do you think you could
get the police

405
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,300
to let me across the barricade,
let me up there?

406
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
Maybe I could talk to him.

407
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,700
Maybe I could find out
what he knows,

408
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,400
what's going on up there.

409
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,700
Maybe I could find out
about Joe.

410
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,300
<i>BRUCE:
Joe Dubois just called.</i>

411
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,300
<i>Did you hear what I said?</i>

412
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,600
<i>That was Joe Dubois.
He needs a ride to work.</i>

413
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,800
I mean,
that's a...

414
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,900
I mean, that's
fate, right?

415
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,300
I mean, that's...
that's...

416
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,700
that's providence.

417
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,800
I'm supposed to go back there.

418
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,500
No, you're not.
You were fired.

419
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,900
Honey, I was unfairly dismissed.

420
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,100
And...

421
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,700
and I'm sick.

422
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,700
Honey...

423
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,600
I'm dying.

424
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,300
And every day this thing
eats more and more of my brain.

425
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,200
Two months... right?

426
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,700
The doctor said two months.

427
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
And you need money.

428
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,400
Right?

429
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,200
And if they won't
give me my job back

430
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,500
and they won't give you
my pension...

431
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,800
Gail, honey,

432
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,800
you're gonna
need money.

433
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,100
I'm sorry.

434
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,800
I... that...

435
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,300
that's all I can do. I...

436
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,700
That's as far as I can go.

437
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,300
I don't have...

438
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,700
access to that part
of the system.

439
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,900
To the root directory?

440
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,900
You don't have access
to the root directory?

441
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,400
Oh, my goodness.

442
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,500
Who would?

443
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,400
I mean, a clearance
like that would require

444
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,500
someone in senior
management, someone the company could rely on
in a time of crisis

445
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,500
to exhibit courage
and character and loyalty.

446
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
We all know who
I'm talking about.

447
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,300
I can't get you into
the root directory, Bruce.

448
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,700
Believe me, I would if I could.

449
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,600
But, honestly...
Really?

450
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,500
Well, I'll tell you what
I'm going to do, Mr. Kravitz.

451
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,400
I'm going to promote you, okay?

452
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,400
I'm going to make it your job to
get me into the root directory.

453
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I guess I'm going to need you
to make it work...

454
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,300
with the resources
that you have available to you.

455
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,600
It's not about resources.

456
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,600
It's about being given a task that I am simply incapable
of performing.

457
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Surely you can see
the distinction there.

458
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,400
Yeah, I'm afraid I don't
see the distinction!

459
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,100
Okay, so I think that...

460
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,000
I think this discussion is over.

461
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,700
So I'm going to
need you to get up,

462
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,300
walk over here,
sit your ass in the chair

463
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,300
and get me
into the root directory.

464
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,600
Mr. Kravitz...

465
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,500
you're wasting my time.

466
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,000
But as I just
explained to you,

467
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,400
I don't know the first thing
about how to get you...

468
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,100
Hey.
He's okay.

469
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,900
He's okay. Joe.

470
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,600
Sit down, all right?

471
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,500
Just a memory jogger.

472
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,100
Right, Mr. Kravitz?

473
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,100
All right.

474
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,300
It's not too bad.
It's not too bad.

475
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,500
Okay... (clears throat)

476
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,100
so about the root directory.

477
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,900
Joe's still alive.

478
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,700
<i>If you enter from the back of the building,</i>

479
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,800
you won't be seen
from the window...
Sorry to interrupt.

480
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,400
But as you know, Mrs. Dubois'
husband is one of the hostages.

481
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,900
Apparently, he was able
to hold on to his cell phone until a few moments ago

482
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,700
and has given her a great deal
of information

483
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,100
about what's
going on inside.

484
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,800
The hostage taker's a former employee
named Bruce Rossiter.

485
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,500
See if he has a wife
or a mother,

486
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,200
and see if we can get them
down here, all right?

487
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,800
In addition
to my husband,

488
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,600
there's a senior executive
named Dylan Kravitz

489
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,600
and a pregnant engineer named
Melinda Bell are still up there.

490
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,200
A junior engineer named
Aaron Cahill was the man we heard being shot
earlier--

491
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
he is dead.

492
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
And we're certain of that?

493
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,900
Yes, we're absolutely certain.

494
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,200
You're in.

495
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,600
Nicely done, Mr. Kravitz.

496
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,100
Now pull up everything there is
in Beta Omicron.

497
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,400
<i>TV REPORTER:
Reports continue to leak out of a unconfirmed
death here at Aerodytech.</i>

498
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,200
Our sources informing us that
the identity of the deceased

499
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,500
is being withheld pending
notification of next of kin.

500
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,000
Principal Phillips, I really
need to use that phone.

501
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,100
Ariel, we've had
this conversation.

502
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,700
Aren't you supposed
to be in class?

503
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,600
Yeah, I know.

504
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,300
But this is really urgent.

505
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,900
Really urgent? No.

506
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,900
The only thing
that's really urgent is that you get back to class.

507
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,000
And what would you do
if I said no?

508
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,400
Excuse me?

509
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,000
What would you do if I told you

510
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,300
that I'm just not
going back to class?

511
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,700
Come in here, young lady.

512
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,900
Have a seat.
We're calling your parents.

513
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,700
Get me Ariel Dubois' mother

514
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
Okay, good.

515
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Copy all of those and
don't leave anything out.

516
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Okay, but do you mind if I ask what is
all this stuff for,

517
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,300
posterity?
You won't be able to sell it.

518
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,500
It's not as if any of our
competitors are interested

519
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,900
in buying designs of satellites
that fall out of the sky.

520
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,900
Well, you never know.

521
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,500
There's always eBay.

522
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,000
You've already done
the programming corrections,

523
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,300
haven't you?

524
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,300
You've done them
yourself.

525
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,500
I told you not to and
you did them yourself...

526
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,700
on your own time,
on your own dime.

527
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,300
You have a buyer already,
haven't you?

528
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,100
You want to know
the ironic part, Mr. Kravitz?

529
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,700
I did it for you.

530
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,900
I did it for Aerodytech.

531
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,700
What a fool, huh?

532
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,000
Bruce, this makes
no sense.

533
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,100
You've killed a man.

534
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,200
You're never going
to get away with this.

535
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,400
I know.

536
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,800
I... I guess I must just be
out of my mind, huh?

537
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,000
Mrs. Rossiter.

538
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,000
You're married
to Bruce Rossiter.

539
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,400
Yes, Bruce is my husband.

540
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,900
Why, has something happened?

541
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,900
It's terrifying
to open your door and see

542
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,000
the police standing there
and not know why.

543
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I've just had
this feeling

544
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
that today was going
to be a bad day.

545
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,700
Have you turned on
your television today?

546
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,200
Listened to the radio?

547
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,900
No.
Did you know

548
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,500
your husband was coming here
to Aerodytech today?

549
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,000
This man called him last night
and asked him for a ride

550
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,700
and he thought
it was a sign.

551
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,100
So he was going to go in
and ask for his job back.

552
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,300
Why?

553
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,300
Something happened?
Is something wrong?

554
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,000
We believe your
husband is inside

555
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,400
holding a number of
people hostage.

556
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,700
(ringtone playing)
We also believe

557
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,200
he may have already
killed one man.

558
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,800
MRS. ROSSITER:
Nonsense.

559
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,500
That's crazy.

560
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,200
Bruce wouldn't
hurt anyone.

561
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,500
Certainly no one here.
He loved this company.

562
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,900
Hello?
Ms. Dubois?

563
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,500
Yes, this is Principal Phillips over at North Street
Middle School.

564
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,000
I have Ariel in my office.

565
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,400
Is something wrong?
Is she all right?

566
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,500
No, no, she's fine.

567
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,900
But, frankly, she's been
refusing to go to class.

568
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,500
May I talk to her?
Can I please just talk to her?

569
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,600
Looks like someone's
getting their wish.

570
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,900
Mom?

571
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,700
Ariel, not today.
You can't do this to me today.

572
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,000
Mom, don't talk.

573
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,600
Just listen.

574
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,800
I saw this man...

575
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,000
and Dad called him and asked him
for a ride to work...

576
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,300
No! The man you're talking
about is not my husband.

577
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,000
He wouldn't kill anyone.
He couldn't kill anyone.

578
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,200
Isn't it true, Mrs. Rossiter,

579
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,500
that your husband has
a disease of the brain?

580
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,400
That he only has
weeks to live?

581
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,200
He's already a dead man,
isn't he?

582
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,700
Which means everyone that he
is holding at gunpoint up there

583
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,200
is most certainly dead, too.

584
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,000
They're starting to position
men inside the building to breach the conference room.

585
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,400
They don't know
what else to do.

586
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,600
He won't get on the phone
and negotiate with them.

587
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,600
He seems determined
to do whatever it is
he's doing up there.

588
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,100
And now that we know
he's terminal...

589
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,700
From the moment I opened my
eyes this morning, I knew it.

590
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,400
I could feel it.

591
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,800
I wanted him to stay home.

592
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,900
But he just couldn't feel it
the way that I could feel it.

593
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,700
I'm so sorry, Allison.

594
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,400
I wish there were
more I could do.

595
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,000
You skipped one.

596
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,700
You skip one it's worthless.

597
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,700
I'm sorry. It was
an accident. I'm sorry.

598
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,900
Joe, would you mind?

599
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,400
Joe, hang it up now please.

600
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,500
It's your wife.

601
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,700
Okay... every,
every single file.

602
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,700
Every single file.

603
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,200
Just... just slide it over.

604
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
Gail?

605
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,600
Oh, my God, Bruce.

606
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,500
What are you doing?

607
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,400
Honey, I don't know
what you mean.

608
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,600
I told you I was coming here.

609
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,900
I'm doing what I have to do.

610
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,600
But you should see it
out here.

611
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
There are police everywhere.

612
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,400
Everything's going
to be okay, honey.

613
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,900
They're saying you killed a man.

614
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,600
Is it true? Did you...

615
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,200
actually kill someone?

616
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,400
Gail, I know what
I'm doing, okay?

617
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,400
Oh, I don't think you do.

618
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,700
I think the cancer
in your brain

619
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,900
is making you go crazy.

620
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,700
Gail, that's...
(clearing throat)

621
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,500
that's our business, okay.

622
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
I don't want to
discuss that here.

623
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,100
You'll be dead, and me,
your son,

624
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,700
we'll still be living here
and people will know

625
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,300
what you've done.

626
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,800
Tell you what, um, honey,
I'm almost done.

627
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,000
So just let me do
what I have to do, okay?

628
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,700
No, I can't.

629
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,200
Am I ever going
to see you again?

630
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,800
Well, that's up
to the police, honey.

631
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,600
What about the other ones--

632
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,600
the people you're holding?

633
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,500
Will they see
their families again?

634
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,300
I need to hang up now, honey.

635
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,100
Yeah, but the police...

636
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,400
they think you're going
to kill them all.

637
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,700
Tell them you're not going
to kill them all.

638
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,200
Gail... I love you.

639
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,300
Oh, Bruce...

640
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,700
You tell Ethan, that I love him.

641
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,700
I love him so much.

642
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,200
Okay, I have to hang up
now, babe.

643
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,200
Bruce?!

644
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,600
I'm almost done.

645
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,100
So, is that true?

646
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,100
You really sick?

647
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,200
Why don't you think about it,
Mr. Kravitz,

648
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,600
you can't do something like this

649
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,200
and expect to have
any kind of a future.

650
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,300
Well, I have a future!

651
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,400
I have a baby!

652
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,800
We all have futures, Bruce.

653
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I mean, think about it.

654
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,700
It really...

655
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,100
I mean it really
just comes down to you.

656
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,500
You can give us that.

657
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,300
You can... you can
show us the mercy

658
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,400
that you feel has
been denied you.

659
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,900
And that would be,
at least in part, a-a-a...

660
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,000
a legacy

661
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,900
that you could leave
to your family.

662
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,900
KRAVITZ:
He's right.
You should be thinking of your family right now.

663
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,100
You don't want to do this to them.

664
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,100
Don't you dare.

665
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,800
Don't you dare pretend
to give a crap about my family.

666
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,000
If you possessed
even an ounce of mercy,

667
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,700
an ounce of fairness,

668
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,700
none of us
would be here.

669
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,600
But you don't.

670
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,700
And we are.

671
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,100
No! There is no reason

672
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,600
for you to kill us.

673
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,200
Bruce, you are a logical man.

674
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,300
What... What purpose
could it possibly serve

675
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,400
for you to shoot
us all? None.

676
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,500
There's no reason

677
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,200
why we couldn't
all walk out of here.

678
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,600
Think, Bruce, think about it.

679
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,200
Joe, I have thought about it.

680
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,800
And everything
we've done here...

681
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,800
every key stroke on the computer
has been completely encrypted.

682
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,200
Understand?

683
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,000
So six months from now
when my wife gets a call

684
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,100
from a lawyer
in the Cayman Islands

685
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,400
telling her about
her unexpected windfall,

686
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,100
no one will be able to trace it
back to this room.

687
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,700
To any of us.

688
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,500
To what's happened here.

689
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,800
Unless...

690
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,400
you know, unless someone
makes it out that door.

691
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,500
I'm really, really sorry.

692
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Upon my signal--
all firearms at the ready.

693
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,000
No. No.

694
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,500
How are you going to do it?

695
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,200
What do you mean?

696
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,200
I mean, you only get
one shot, you know.

697
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,100
One shot and every policeman
in Phoenix who can fire a gun

698
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,800
is coming through that door.

699
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,300
I don't know what
you're talking about.

700
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,800
I can shoot three people.

701
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,400
No, you can't!

702
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,800
No... No!

703
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,500
Don't anybody move!

704
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,300
Allison.
(laughing)

705
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,800
Allison?

706
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,300
The dread...

707
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,900
I think it just left.

708
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,200
ARIEL:
Mom...

709
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,000
Shh.

710
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,400
What are we doing?

711
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,100
We're watching
Daddy sleep.

712
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,600
It's the first time he's
slept through the night

713
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
since Aaron's funeral.

714
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,700
Oh, look, he's smiling.

715
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,300
I was afraid he would
never smile again.

716
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,900
<i>Hope, like dread, it often
comes unannounced,</i>

717
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,000
<i>and then thankfully
intoxicates us</i>

718
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,400
<i>and inoculates our feelings</i>

719
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,300
<i>with an irrational sense
of joy and optimism.</i>

720
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,100
<i>Hope is the high,
dread is the low.</i>

721
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,700
<i>I guess life is the stuff
in between.</i>

722
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,700
