1
00:00:00,136 --> 00:00:07,807
<i>There's you and me And all of the people with nothing to do</i>

2
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:12,690
<i>Nothing to lose and it's you and me</i>

3
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:15,983
Damn.

4
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:21,493
Toby! Stop!

5
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:24,329
Cock-a-doodle-do.

6
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:27,158
Cock-a-doodle who?

7
00:01:28,752 --> 00:01:29,972
Never mind.
I take that back.

8
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,880
It's way too early for this kind of talk.

9
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:35,318
Do you know that it's barely 5:00?

10
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,285
I know.

11
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:41,750
Is that a grocery list?

12
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:44,728
Kind of.

13
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:49,145
It's a list of things Ariel thinks she needs
for her slumber party tomorrow night.

14
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:51,915
Rice cakes, sunflower seeds? What?

15
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:54,341
Ariel's trying to make friends
with this girl named Celeste

16
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:55,980
who is allergic to gluten.

17
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:00,239
This is why you're up so early?

18
00:02:02,468 --> 00:02:03,226
No.

19
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:05,164
I hit a girl with my car.

20
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:08,045
In a dream.

21
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:09,665
Okay.

22
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:14,025
Was anyone else with you?

23
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,741
No.

24
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:18,827
Was it nighttime, daytime?

25
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:19,726
It was night.

26
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:23,291
Any idea where the street might have been?

27
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:24,680
What do you mean?
Like a name?

28
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:26,117
A name would be good.

29
00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:30,688
Well, I remember
I felt like it was that area

30
00:02:31,636 --> 00:02:34,028
near the hospital
where all those houses are.

31
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:35,408
Okay, this is easy.

32
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,520
I'm glad you feel so relieved.

33
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,202
Let's just agree,
from now until the end of time,

34
00:02:40,847 --> 00:02:42,400
that you don't drive alone at night

35
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:45,414
in that area by the hospital
where the houses are.

36
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,687
What? You're upset?

37
00:02:48,738 --> 00:02:50,422
I'm just frustrated. That's all.

38
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:51,295
Why?

39
00:02:52,276 --> 00:02:54,339
We've been at this for a while now.

40
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:55,435
And?

41
00:02:55,685 --> 00:02:56,767
All this skepticism.

42
00:02:56,818 --> 00:02:57,971
This isn't skepticism.

43
00:02:58,756 --> 00:03:00,796
This is the exact opposite of skepticism.

44
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:03,403
This is absolute conviction followed by--

45
00:03:03,454 --> 00:03:04,906
and this is the important part--

46
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:07,227
by completely logical plan of action.

47
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:08,004
Really?

48
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:08,773
Truly.

49
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:09,500
It's like that joke.

50
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:11,307
The guy walks in to the doctor's office, he says, "Hey, Doc,

51
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,536
"my arm hurts when I raise it like this." And the doctor says,

52
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:16,206
"Fine. Don't raise it like that."

53
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:18,799
We can't stop the night from coming,

54
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,421
we can't stop the girl from stepping out into the road.

55
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,414
But if you're not in the road in your car,

56
00:03:23,465 --> 00:03:24,478
you're not gonna hit her.

57
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:26,477
Allison, smile,
for God's sake.

58
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,052
This is a tragedy we can absolutely avoid.

59
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,372
This is a gift.

60
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,372
Now I say we celebrate...

61
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:34,544
back in bed.

62
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:41,678
Would you like me to check your oil?

63
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,173
You're kidding me.

64
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,406
You guys still do that?

65
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:46,545
Well, you're at the full service island, Miss.

66
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:49,643
Damn it.

67
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:52,494
So would you like me to check something?

68
00:03:53,826 --> 00:03:54,869
I don't know, no.

69
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:56,656
Oh, wait a second.

70
00:04:04,634 --> 00:04:05,234
Morning.

71
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:07,690
Morning. I'm not sure if you're even open yet,

72
00:04:07,741 --> 00:04:10,926
but, uh, I was just hoping to get a cup of coffee

73
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:13,272
while they put in a new headlight for me across the street.

74
00:04:13,323 --> 00:04:14,433
Yeah, right this way.

75
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,577
Stop it.

76
00:04:57,468 --> 00:04:58,356
Thank you.

77
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:16,566
James?

78
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:24,915
James!

79
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:32,414
Nadine.

80
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,062
What are you doing?

81
00:05:37,636 --> 00:05:38,954
Did you call the broker?

82
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:42,402
No, I did not call the broker.

83
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,241
It just did it again in the bathroom.

84
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,222
Nadine.

85
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,474
There's no water and the lights flickered on and off.

86
00:05:53,904 --> 00:05:55,222
It is an old house.

87
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:04,057
There's water now.

88
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:07,985
There's water.

89
00:06:12,523 --> 00:06:13,890
I want to move.

90
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:17,536
Nadine, please.

91
00:06:19,058 --> 00:06:20,916
I can't live like this, James.

92
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:23,764
I just...

93
00:06:25,396 --> 00:06:26,334
I can't.

94
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,435
I think I need to tell someone.

95
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,563
Tell someone what exactly?

96
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:47,164
Tell someone what?

97
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,592
Tell someone what?

98
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:02,394
Tell someone what?!

99
00:07:02,445 --> 00:07:03,191
What?!

100
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,848
Here you go.

101
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,538
Oh, thank you.

102
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:27,867
Pardon me.

103
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,740
I don't mean to trouble you,

104
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,508
but would you mind if I stole some of your artificial sweetener?

105
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,309
Excuse me?

106
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:35,850
Sweetener.

107
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:37,634
I don't have any at my table.

108
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:42,543
Thank you.

109
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:43,530
Sure.

110
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,393
Was there something else?

111
00:07:52,376 --> 00:07:53,613
Are you all right?

112
00:07:56,521 --> 00:07:58,365
I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry.

113
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,419
It's just...

114
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:03,615
You know what?

115
00:08:06,188 --> 00:08:07,707
In case you change your mind.

116
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:13,348
The District Attorney's office?

117
00:08:15,465 --> 00:08:17,711
Crying in public against the law?

118
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:20,767
No, no, of course not.

119
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:23,308
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:24,881
You're trying to be nice,

121
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:26,356
and I'm not playing along.

122
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,826
Let me pay for your coffee.

123
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:31,413
No, no, no.
You don't have to do that.

124
00:08:31,546 --> 00:08:32,889
But I'd like to.

125
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,577
Well, it's my birthday in a couple of days.

126
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,751
I'd like to do something nice for somebody.

127
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:44,560
Enjoy your coffee.

128
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:49,372
Try not to trip on the sugar when you sit back down.

129
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:54,944
All I'm saying is I should have gotten her name, that's all.

130
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:56,321
It was stupid of me.

131
00:08:57,506 --> 00:08:59,209
What would you have done if you had gotten her name?

132
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:00,622
I don't know.

133
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:02,293
Run it through the computer at work.

134
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,041
See if there was ever a police report,

135
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:06,411
see if she ever filed a restraining order.

136
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,539
Did you get tofu?

137
00:09:08,116 --> 00:09:08,952
I got it.

138
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:10,201
Tofu?

139
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,513
Celeste likes it on her pizza.

140
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:13,721
Yum.

141
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,152
Who's this Celeste?

142
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:17,765
I don't remember you ever having mentioned her before.

143
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:19,159
She's a new girl at school.

144
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,633
Her family just moved here from New York.

145
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:22,106
I really like her.

146
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:25,505
She's traveled everywhere and knows everything about everything.

147
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:31,896
Hello?

148
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,125
Allison, it's Lee Scanlon.
Did I wake you?

149
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:35,355
It's okay.

150
00:09:35,969 --> 00:09:37,651
Do you know somebody named Nadine Massey?

151
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:39,791
Nadine Massey.

152
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:41,795
No, never heard of her.

153
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:43,651
She's not a friend of yours,

154
00:09:43,702 --> 00:09:44,892
someone you met through work, maybe?

155
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:46,444
I don't think so.

156
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,130
Any idea why she might have your business card?

157
00:09:51,231 --> 00:09:53,961
Wait, yeah, I might have met her yesterday.

158
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:55,344
What's going on? Is she okay?

159
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:58,607
"Okay" is not an adjective I'd use, no.

160
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,315
So their names are Hannah,

161
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:08,884
Celeste and Ashley.

162
00:10:09,457 --> 00:10:10,509
No, I know Hannah.

163
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:14,396
They're not due here till 3:00, and I will absolutely be back before then,

164
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,274
so don't worry.

165
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:16,579
I believe you.

166
00:10:17,305 --> 00:10:18,492
I need to know if it's her.

167
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:20,465
No, I know.

168
00:10:21,132 --> 00:10:22,468
Like I was supposed to meet her,

169
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,463
like I was supposed to help her,
and I didn't.

170
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,172
Al, give yourself a break.

171
00:10:26,223 --> 00:10:28,378
You only met this woman for five minutes.

172
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:30,060
I know.

173
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:34,644
Husband says he fell asleep on the sofa watching television.

174
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:37,241
When he woke up around 3:00 and went to the bedroom,

175
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:38,936
he found his wife dead on the floor.

176
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:40,431
Gunshot wound to the right temple.

177
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:42,107
He didn't hear the gunshot?

178
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:43,445
That's what he says.

179
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,404
Terrace doors were open, but there's no sign of an intruder.

180
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:49,102
The gun was on the floor next to her.

181
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:51,280
Husband says that he kept it in the bedroom safe.

182
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:53,674
Guy says he loved his wife like the dickens.

183
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:55,962
That she was admittedly the high-strung type,

184
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:56,943
prone to hysteria.

185
00:10:57,537 --> 00:11:00,481
He seems devastated but not all that surprised she decided to end it all.

186
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:03,001
You don't seem so convinced.

187
00:11:03,294 --> 00:11:04,044
I don't know.

188
00:11:05,686 --> 00:11:08,022
I guess I'm a little surprised she'd choose to use a gun when there's

189
00:11:08,073 --> 00:11:10,382
enough tranquilizers in the house to take down Shamu.

190
00:11:12,928 --> 00:11:14,480
Want to hear something really strange?

191
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,465
The last few days,

192
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:20,772
she actually seemed happy.

193
00:11:22,755 --> 00:11:23,589
Happy?

194
00:11:24,304 --> 00:11:25,088
Well...

195
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:27,731
I mean, happier than she'd been...

196
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:30,000
in a long time.

197
00:11:33,885 --> 00:11:35,932
At least it seemed that way to me.
I don't know.

198
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:40,200
Maybe it was actually relief.

199
00:11:42,908 --> 00:11:44,025
Making the decision...

200
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:46,374
knowing...

201
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:49,414
that it'll all be over soon.

202
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,242
I appreciate you taking the time to speak with us.

203
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:13,669
May have to speak with you again in the next few days.

204
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:15,316
By all means, Detective.

205
00:12:17,574 --> 00:12:19,174
Daddy, what beats two pairs?

206
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:20,399
Uh, three of a kind.

207
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,537
Hey, hey, you.

208
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:24,582
Who wants popcorn?

209
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,601
Oh, I do,
I do, I do!

210
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:28,352
- Want popcorn?
- Yeah.

211
00:12:28,771 --> 00:12:29,764
Thank you very much.

212
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:31,827
Daddy, what beats three of a kind?

213
00:12:31,878 --> 00:12:33,231
A full house.

214
00:12:33,517 --> 00:12:34,546
I see your melon.

215
00:12:34,597 --> 00:12:35,987
I'll raise you a cherry.

216
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,313
Wait, you've got a full house?

217
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:39,624
I quit.

218
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:42,044
Fold, Celeste.
You mean you fold.

219
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,483
Yeah, I fold, too.

220
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:45,908
Okay, uh, anybody else need anything?

221
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:46,782
Everybody okay?

222
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,188
No, we're okay.

223
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:48,839
All right.

224
00:12:48,813 --> 00:12:51,911
So we're heading back to the bedroom for a hot game of Hungry Hungry Hippos.

225
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:53,678
Hungry Hungry Hippos!

226
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:55,972
Um, holler if you need me to float you a loan.

227
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:56,932
Yes, Daddy.

228
00:12:57,217 --> 00:12:58,366
Thanks,
Mr. Dubois.

229
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,845
This is no fun.
You always win.

230
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:04,605
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't help it.

231
00:13:05,093 --> 00:13:06,031
She's just lucky.

232
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,848
That's all.

233
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:11,165
Well, I want to do something else, something fun.

234
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,222
You don't have a swimming pool or an X-box or anything.

235
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:15,638
Your house is no fun.

236
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:18,286
Well, I'm sorry.

237
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:20,645
It's okay. You can't help that you're boring.

238
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:25,465
Well, how about we play...

239
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,160
Tomorrows?

240
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:29,681
Tomorrows?

241
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,342
Oh, God,

242
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:33,109
she's really good at this.

243
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:36,479
Three of diamonds.

244
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,641
That's a good card.

245
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:40,417
A lucky card.

246
00:13:41,538 --> 00:13:43,615
There's a boy you like.

247
00:13:45,684 --> 00:13:46,727
Robert...

248
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:48,583
Bobby...

249
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:49,815
Bobby Soames?

250
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:52,221
He'll call you tomorrow.

251
00:13:52,688 --> 00:13:53,728
Who's Bobby Soames?

252
00:13:54,275 --> 00:13:55,799
He's a friend of my brother's.

253
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,142
He doesn't even go to our school.

254
00:13:58,363 --> 00:13:59,304
How did you know?

255
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:00,315
I told you,

256
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:01,459
she's really good at this.

257
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:02,516
Do me. Do me.

258
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:03,195
Okay.

259
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:07,204
Five of spades.

260
00:14:07,918 --> 00:14:09,365
Not so lucky.

261
00:14:10,452 --> 00:14:11,110
What?

262
00:14:13,316 --> 00:14:15,175
Something's going to happento your left ankle.

263
00:14:17,518 --> 00:14:19,117
What are you talking about?

264
00:14:20,056 --> 00:14:21,024
Maybe I'm wrong.

265
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:22,517
I don't know.

266
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:24,300
You knew about Bobby Soames.

267
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:26,448
I'd stay off that ankle.

268
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:29,680
Okay, my turn.

269
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:31,167
Wait a second.

270
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:32,767
I'm the new friend.

271
00:14:33,196 --> 00:14:35,194
I'm the guest. Do me again.

272
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,507
The queen of hearts.

273
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:43,599
I like that one.

274
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:47,438
What's the matter?

275
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:50,074
Tell me what it means.

276
00:14:54,107 --> 00:14:55,384
You're not going to tell me?

277
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,430
It doesn't mean anything.

278
00:15:00,822 --> 00:15:06,740
Um, it just basically says that I can only give one fortune at a time.

279
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,462
And that's it?

280
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:10,583
What is that, like,
a rule or something?

281
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,598
That's no fun.

282
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:15,877
I don't want to play this anymore. This is stupid.

283
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:18,381
But what about my tomorrow?

284
00:15:18,775 --> 00:15:20,147
Girls, I'm home!

285
00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:23,189
That's my mom. She said she'd bring home
some pizza and some movies.

286
00:15:33,281 --> 00:15:34,022
Hi.

287
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:37,862
Sorry, honey. Did I wake you?

288
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:40,276
No.

289
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,144
I just can't sleep.

290
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:45,818
Excited, huh?

291
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:47,736
I guess.

292
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:51,317
Everybody having a good time?

293
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:53,490
Yeah.

294
00:15:55,057 --> 00:15:56,363
I don't know.

295
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,710
Honey, you're not sorry you had everybody over, are you?

296
00:16:03,553 --> 00:16:04,272
No.

297
00:16:04,802 --> 00:16:07,309
Honey, I'm sure it's going a lot better than you think.

298
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,554
I'm just sorry I wasn't here when everyone got here.

299
00:16:12,576 --> 00:16:14,988
That's okay. You had to work.

300
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:28,190
12 is hard.

301
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:30,869
38 is harder.

302
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,197
That's why it's important to practice when you're 12.

303
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,252
What's going on?

304
00:16:36,884 --> 00:16:38,387
Ariel is upset about something.

305
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:40,729
Anything serious?

306
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:42,890
Everything's serious when you're 12.

307
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:46,852
I just felt badly I wasn't home earlier this afternoon.

308
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:49,230
By the time I left that lady's house,

309
00:16:49,348 --> 00:16:50,247
rented the videos,

310
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:52,418
went to the pizza place and waited for one

311
00:16:52,563 --> 00:16:54,818
gluten-free crust, please,

312
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,436
headed home,

313
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,225
it was already dark.

314
00:16:58,394 --> 00:17:00,486
And suddenly there's the hospital, so I panic.

315
00:17:00,745 --> 00:17:02,984
I turn around, and I take all the back roads home.

316
00:17:03,811 --> 00:17:04,921
Did you hit anyone?

317
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:06,908
Not that I noticed.

318
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:09,709
Then stop beating yourself up.

319
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,607
I was here, and I did a magnificent job.

320
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,173
You refuse to have a serious conversation with me.

321
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:20,399
Shoot me; I'm in a good mood.

322
00:17:20,856 --> 00:17:22,231
Oh, that must be nice.

323
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:26,596
Sorry, but I refuse to contribute to the celebration

324
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:28,690
of everything that is wrong with Allison Dubois.

325
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:30,668
Yes, our 12-year-old,

326
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:34,202
after being allowed to stay up way past her bedtime with her three friends,

327
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,551
and after eating enough food to choke a horse and drinking stuff which in

328
00:17:38,602 --> 00:17:41,443
other countries is probably used to take the paint off of airplanes,

329
00:17:41,738 --> 00:17:43,724
probably isn't feeling 100%,

330
00:17:43,838 --> 00:17:45,311
and I'm sure that that's your fault.

331
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:46,458
That's not what I'm talking about.

332
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:48,607
And some woman that you met completely by chance yesterday,

333
00:17:48,784 --> 00:17:50,884
and whose name you didn't even know until this morning,

334
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:53,498
who was bound and determined to take her own life,

335
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,883
took her own life,

336
00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:56,814
and I'm sure that that was your fault, too.

337
00:17:57,065 --> 00:17:59,656
Look, I know you're trying to cheer me up.

338
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:00,736
And my personal favorite:

339
00:18:00,853 --> 00:18:02,623
a girl that you hit with your car in a dream--

340
00:18:02,674 --> 00:18:03,558
which, by the way,

341
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:04,972
means you didn't really hit her--

342
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,243
why don't you get a head start on that and get upset about that now rather

343
00:18:08,294 --> 00:18:10,527
than wait and see if and when it actually does happen?

344
00:18:10,578 --> 00:18:11,226
Are you through?

345
00:18:11,277 --> 00:18:12,641
No, I'm making a point.

346
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:17,390
Yes, I'm in a good mood.

347
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,944
Every loudmouthed girl in this house--

348
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:21,381
half of them are ours--

349
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:23,017
are finally asleep.

350
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:24,384
Tomorrow is Sunday,

351
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:26,318
which means that I don't have to go to work.

352
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:28,149
And lastly...

353
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:30,235
I don't know if you've noticed,

354
00:18:30,286 --> 00:18:33,626
but this whole damn place smells like s'mores.

355
00:18:34,505 --> 00:18:36,475
So, sorry, baby, I refuse to be depressed,

356
00:18:36,768 --> 00:18:40,859
and that means I refuse to let you be depressed, either.

357
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:45,604
Wow, that's the same speech I just gave Ariel.

358
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:46,675
See?

359
00:18:47,314 --> 00:18:49,381
Mediocre minds think alike.

360
00:19:00,162 --> 00:19:01,795
I think I need to tell someone.

361
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:10,029
Tell someone what exactly?

362
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:14,714
Tell someone what?

363
00:19:21,676 --> 00:19:24,166
Tell someone what?!

364
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:30,099
Tell someone what?!

365
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,750
What?!

366
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:34,708
Never mind.

367
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:11,915
James?

368
00:20:13,194 --> 00:20:13,969
James?!

369
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:21,158
Please stop.

370
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,223
Thank you.

371
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:35,169
<i>Did you ever see a dream walking?</i>

372
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:37,027
<i>Well, I did</i>

373
00:20:39,476 --> 00:20:42,163
<i>Did you ever hear a dream talking?</i>

374
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:45,222
<i>Well, I did.</i>

375
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,594
<i>Did you ever have a dream thrill you?</i>

376
00:20:50,162 --> 00:20:53,646
<i>With "Will you be mine?"</i>

377
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:04,008
<i>Did you ever see a dream dancing?</i>

378
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:06,029
<i>Well, I did</i>

379
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:10,518
<i>Did you ever see a dream romancing?</i>

380
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,189
James?

381
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,128
<i>Well, I did</i>

382
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,837
James! Make it stop!

383
00:21:17,052 --> 00:21:19,297
James! James!

384
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:24,468
Nadine!

385
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,808
Hey, you.

386
00:21:44,986 --> 00:21:45,680
Hey.

387
00:21:46,165 --> 00:21:47,300
Did you have a good class?

388
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:49,988
Yeah. Can we just go, please?

389
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,987
Okay, did you say good-bye to...

390
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:54,403
Yes. Can we please just go?

391
00:21:57,893 --> 00:22:01,452
So, anybody in school say anything about your party?

392
00:22:01,718 --> 00:22:02,400
I don't know.

393
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,242
I guess.

394
00:22:04,008 --> 00:22:04,735
Did they have fun?

395
00:22:04,786 --> 00:22:05,838
Did the girls have a good time?

396
00:22:06,345 --> 00:22:07,181
Yes, Mom.

397
00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:08,272
Everyone had fun.

398
00:22:08,323 --> 00:22:11,071
Now can we please not discuss it?

399
00:22:12,057 --> 00:22:13,049
Okay.

400
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:21,473
At the slumber party,

401
00:22:23,044 --> 00:22:24,276
just for fun,

402
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,900
I kind of started telling everyone their future.

403
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,076
Okay.

404
00:22:30,805 --> 00:22:31,541
It was easy.

405
00:22:31,592 --> 00:22:34,596
I just thought things in my head and I...

406
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:36,584
I said them out loud.

407
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:40,166
And I knew the stuff I thought would make them like me.

408
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:45,242
I knew Celeste would want to know that the boy she likes would call her.

409
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:50,311
And then I started thinking that Ashley would sprain her ankle.

410
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:52,142
Did you say anything?

411
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:56,250
But then I thought something worse.

412
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:57,640
About Ashley?

413
00:22:58,532 --> 00:22:59,671
About Celeste.

414
00:23:00,752 --> 00:23:01,536
She was older,

415
00:23:01,612 --> 00:23:02,695
like in high school,

416
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,124
and she was in the hospital,

417
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:08,491
and she was really, really sick.

418
00:23:10,314 --> 00:23:14,775
She had tubes going into her and she couldn't breathe,

419
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:18,846
and there was a minister standing there... waiting.

420
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,434
And it just made me so sad.

421
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:25,893
Then I go to dance class,

422
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:28,169
and Ashley sprains her ankle.

423
00:23:29,452 --> 00:23:33,180
And... Celeste told me about Bobby calling.

424
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:40,618
Do you think this means that Celeste will get sick?

425
00:23:42,098 --> 00:23:43,487
Wait a minute.
What did you say?

426
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:44,773
I told her not to tell anybody.

427
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,465
I said a lot of times that I'm wrong.

428
00:23:47,102 --> 00:23:48,483
There's nothing to do but wait,

429
00:23:48,838 --> 00:23:50,924
and she can always talk to me and I'd wait with her.

430
00:23:51,104 --> 00:23:51,780
That's it?

431
00:23:52,624 --> 00:23:53,355
Yeah.

432
00:23:53,918 --> 00:23:54,911
I was pretty proud of myself.

433
00:23:54,962 --> 00:23:56,390
I thought that was a pretty good answer.

434
00:23:56,785 --> 00:23:57,816
I'm not so sure it is.

435
00:23:58,774 --> 00:24:01,646
I'm not so sure that we don't owe this girl's parents a call.

436
00:24:01,848 --> 00:24:02,968
And say what?

437
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:04,306
I don't know.

438
00:24:04,716 --> 00:24:06,070
"Take your kid to a doctor.

439
00:24:06,121 --> 00:24:07,174
Have her tested."

440
00:24:07,878 --> 00:24:11,753
We don't know that whatever she's suffering from
in this vision isn't preventable.

441
00:24:11,804 --> 00:24:12,916
We don't know anything.

442
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:14,258
This is Ariel we're talking about.

443
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:16,445
Yeah, but she got the other two predictions right, didn't she?

444
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:19,061
Excuse me? You want to call
this girl's parents and say, "Hi.

445
00:24:19,112 --> 00:24:21,738
"My daughter Ariel Dubois had a vision that your daughter was

446
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:23,289
fighting for her life in the hospital"?

447
00:24:23,436 --> 00:24:24,135
I don't know.

448
00:24:24,186 --> 00:24:25,353
Don't we have an obligation?

449
00:24:25,404 --> 00:24:28,790
We have an obligation to our daughter not to do or say anything that makes

450
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:31,712
life as a 12-year-old girl any harder than it already is.

451
00:24:32,502 --> 00:24:34,963
And you calling this girl's parents and saying she has visions,

452
00:24:35,014 --> 00:24:37,810
I don't see how that's going to make life in the sixth grade any easier.

453
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:42,081
Oh, man.

454
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:46,856
Oh!

455
00:24:47,564 --> 00:24:49,301
Did I hear someone say Chinese?

456
00:24:50,311 --> 00:24:51,954
It's a beautiful night in Phoenix.

457
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:54,560
The temperature is around 78 degrees,
not a cloud in sight.

458
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:56,154
For those of you that love good music,

459
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:58,832
here's another pretty song coming at you.

460
00:25:05,192 --> 00:25:06,924
<i>What day is it?</i>

461
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:14,003
<i>...this clock now seems so alive</i>

462
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:19,619
<i>I can't give up 'Cause I can...</i>

463
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:22,490
Damn.

464
00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:37,828
<i>And you and me And all of the people With nothing to do, Nothing to lose</i>

465
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:45,072
<i>And it's you and me, And our love of people And I don't know why...</i>

466
00:25:45,123 --> 00:25:46,793
Toby, stop!

467
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:49,799
<i>I can't keep my eyes off of you...</i>

468
00:26:06,393 --> 00:26:08,388
Oh, honey, I need to watch the road.

469
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:19,931
Happy Birthday to me Happy Birthday to you.

470
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:22,051
Oh, hey, come on, baby.

471
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,310
Let's wait till we get home, all right?
I've got a surprise for you.

472
00:26:24,361 --> 00:26:25,736
I don't want to wait.

473
00:26:25,787 --> 00:26:27,343
I want to celebrate.

474
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:29,367
Oh, I made a rhyme.

475
00:26:35,453 --> 00:26:36,935
Toby! Stop!

476
00:26:46,143 --> 00:26:47,073
Oh, my God.

477
00:26:47,447 --> 00:26:49,155
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

478
00:26:55,444 --> 00:26:56,510
What are you doing?

479
00:26:56,961 --> 00:26:58,927
What are you doing?!
Stop the car.

480
00:26:59,893 --> 00:27:01,452
I had two martinis and an Irish coffee.

481
00:27:01,503 --> 00:27:02,685
What about you, Nadine?

482
00:27:03,493 --> 00:27:04,300
What?

483
00:27:05,561 --> 00:27:07,748
Do you want me to go to prison, Nadine?

484
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,941
Do you want me to get locked up?

485
00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:16,756
Because we got smashed on your birthday
and some girl ran right in front of our car?

486
00:27:16,807 --> 00:27:20,717
<i>Our love of people And I don't know why...</i>

487
00:27:20,846 --> 00:27:21,748
We have to call somebody.

488
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:23,136
We have to, we have to tell someone.

489
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:24,627
She'll get help.

490
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:27,365
She's gonna be fine.

491
00:27:28,841 --> 00:27:29,713
So will we.

492
00:27:29,764 --> 00:27:31,477
<i>Nothing to do...</i>

493
00:27:36,396 --> 00:27:38,368
Okay. Sorry, sorry.

494
00:27:40,512 --> 00:27:41,735
Yeah, I remember this case.

495
00:27:41,931 --> 00:27:43,310
Melanie Davenport.

496
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:45,327
Hit-and-run.

497
00:27:45,378 --> 00:27:46,224
You turn up something?

498
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,207
I think the driver was James Massie.

499
00:27:48,262 --> 00:27:49,539
Nadine Massie's husband.

500
00:27:49,662 --> 00:27:51,171
I think she was in the car when it happened,

501
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:54,660
and I think the guilt over what they did drove her to kill herself.

502
00:27:55,353 --> 00:27:56,309
I mean no disrespect,

503
00:27:56,381 --> 00:27:58,805
but does this theory come with any actual evidence?

504
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:02,728
The only eyewitness to the accident was two blocks away and saw a dark four-

505
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:04,427
door hit Melanie and then speed off.

506
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:05,843
According to DMV records,

507
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:08,823
in 2004, the Massies were driving a green ES.

508
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:13,600
The paint found on Melanie's clothing
matches the paint they used on the ES that year.

509
00:28:13,671 --> 00:28:14,985
But not just the ES.

510
00:28:15,317 --> 00:28:16,652
Not just the ES, no.

511
00:28:16,851 --> 00:28:18,243
Well, that's very thin, Lee.

512
00:28:18,384 --> 00:28:19,507
And do we know where the car is now?

513
00:28:19,863 --> 00:28:21,900
Well, according to the DMV,
it was reported stolen.

514
00:28:22,955 --> 00:28:24,778
Don't tell me it happened the day after the accident?

515
00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:26,170
Two, actually.

516
00:28:27,524 --> 00:28:31,379
Report says it disappeared from a mall parking lot
while Nadine Massie was Christmas shopping.

517
00:28:31,805 --> 00:28:32,454
My hunch?

518
00:28:32,681 --> 00:28:35,156
They drove it to a border town,
left it at the curb with the keys in it.

519
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,987
It was probably in 10,000 pieces
in some Mexican chop shop by nightfall.

520
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:41,482
Well, all this is fascinating,

521
00:28:42,255 --> 00:28:45,210
but it really falls under the heading of coincidence and speculation.

522
00:28:45,261 --> 00:28:47,719
I can't even bring in the guy for questioning based on this.

523
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:48,627
Really?

524
00:28:48,841 --> 00:28:50,628
'Cause I already called and asked him to come down.

525
00:28:50,745 --> 00:28:52,298
He's sitting in your conference room right now.

526
00:28:53,408 --> 00:28:56,696
What, to discuss his possible involvement in a year-old hit-and-run case?

527
00:28:58,021 --> 00:28:59,566
Yeah, I may have left that part out.

528
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:07,501
You... um... you call friends,

529
00:29:09,236 --> 00:29:10,139
relatives,

530
00:29:11,831 --> 00:29:13,145
first you have to tell them,

531
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:15,718
you know, that...

532
00:29:16,498 --> 00:29:17,603
that she's gone,

533
00:29:19,864 --> 00:29:22,526
and then, you have to...

534
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:23,768
find a way to, um...

535
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:28,830
you know, get to...

536
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:32,626
how she left.

537
00:29:35,466 --> 00:29:36,595
We appreciate you coming down,

538
00:29:36,646 --> 00:29:37,399
Mr. Massie.

539
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:43,592
We know how difficult this is for you and we want to bring this to as

540
00:29:43,643 --> 00:29:44,874
speedy a resolve as possible.

541
00:29:45,983 --> 00:29:46,909
Unfortunately,

542
00:29:47,795 --> 00:29:52,304
there was a firearm registered in your name that was involved with your

543
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:53,741
late wife's death.

544
00:29:53,881 --> 00:29:55,802
I understand.

545
00:29:56,251 --> 00:29:57,313
You can ask me anything.

546
00:29:58,681 --> 00:29:59,529
I'm sorry.

547
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:00,672
Bit of a cold.

548
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,859
That's fine.

549
00:30:03,254 --> 00:30:06,877
I know that both the detective and Mrs. Dubois have asked you this,

550
00:30:07,852 --> 00:30:12,470
but do you think there was something specific that precipitated your late

551
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:14,534
wife's desire to take her own life?

552
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,688
I've racked my brain.

553
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:21,590
I, um...

554
00:30:24,177 --> 00:30:25,402
Her birthday was coming up.

555
00:30:26,568 --> 00:30:29,943
But she was always pretty excited about that.

556
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,989
You ever own a green 2004 ES, Mr. Massie?

557
00:30:37,366 --> 00:30:38,100
I did.

558
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,742
Um, it was stolen.

559
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,107
We have witnesses that possibly put it at the scene of a hit-and-run.

560
00:30:46,815 --> 00:30:52,525
Okay. Um... well, I mean it was stolen...

561
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:54,935
a while ago.

562
00:30:55,495 --> 00:30:59,254
I think, uh, it's been almost a year now.

563
00:30:59,954 --> 00:31:00,774
We understand that,

564
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,815
but this, this hit-and-run I'm referring to

565
00:31:03,866 --> 00:31:05,862
actually occurred a couple of days before that.

566
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,307
Your wife's birthday, actually.

567
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:12,204
15-year-old girl,

568
00:31:12,325 --> 00:31:13,733
Melanie Davenport, was killed.

569
00:31:14,346 --> 00:31:16,046
She was running after her dog.

570
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:19,051
The person who hit her just kept going.

571
00:31:19,928 --> 00:31:21,618
Didn't even call 911.

572
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:30,736
Okay.

573
00:31:34,082 --> 00:31:37,815
So... the reason I'm here,

574
00:31:39,686 --> 00:31:40,351
I mean...

575
00:31:41,771 --> 00:31:43,104
what you're trying to tell me...

576
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:52,384
You think that maybe my wife hit this girl in our car and never reported it?

577
00:31:56,697 --> 00:31:57,297
Well...

578
00:31:57,246 --> 00:31:59,443
Because... I mean,

579
00:31:59,872 --> 00:32:00,767
if that were true,

580
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:06,143
it would certainly explain a lot of things.

581
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:08,655
What things?

582
00:32:11,202 --> 00:32:12,829
Well, uh...

583
00:32:14,581 --> 00:32:18,181
Nadine's state of mind over this entire past year,

584
00:32:18,232 --> 00:32:18,897
for one.

585
00:32:21,196 --> 00:32:22,580
If this were true, and mind you,

586
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:25,265
I'm not saying that this is,

587
00:32:25,316 --> 00:32:30,629
but... I can't even imagine what kind of...

588
00:32:32,263 --> 00:32:34,521
terrible guilt she must have been living with.

589
00:32:39,478 --> 00:32:41,457
I mean, it's no wonder she was so unstrung.

590
00:32:49,424 --> 00:32:50,760
Everyone's in bed.

591
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,915
I lied and told them you'd sneak in later
while they were asleep and give them kisses.

592
00:32:55,845 --> 00:32:57,792
It's not necessarily a lie.

593
00:32:58,189 --> 00:32:59,411
How do you know it's a lie?

594
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:01,070
I'm a student of history.

595
00:33:01,902 --> 00:33:04,323
And history suggests that when you get in one of these moods,

596
00:33:05,812 --> 00:33:08,910
the kind where you end up laying here on the couch stewing in your

597
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:11,390
inability to effect any real change,

598
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,129
eventually you fall asleep and no one sees you till morning.

599
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:18,535
It's not going to happen.

600
00:33:19,148 --> 00:33:22,646
I just need a little time for myself, okay?

601
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,146
I had a very depressing day.

602
00:33:28,488 --> 00:33:29,217
Well, I wouldn't know.

603
00:33:29,268 --> 00:33:31,979
You haven't said three words to me since I got home.

604
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:34,012
Here are the highlights:
James Massie--

605
00:33:34,134 --> 00:33:36,749
he completely sold out his poor dead wife today.

606
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:39,283
He could have said he didn't know anything.

607
00:33:39,908 --> 00:33:41,502
He knows we can't prove he was there.

608
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,143
But no, he had to go that extra step

609
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:47,835
and offer up Nadine who is not in a position to defend herself.

610
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:52,751
I'm sorry. I just have to get that out of my system.

611
00:33:53,358 --> 00:33:55,157
Well, I have something I have to get out of my system.

612
00:33:56,041 --> 00:34:00,147
I asked Ariel for Celeste's parents' names and phone number today.

613
00:34:01,644 --> 00:34:02,622
I'm a scientist.

614
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,325
People don't fall suddenly ill.

615
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,428
It happens gradually over time.

616
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:09,594
And there are windows of opportunity in which to intervene.

617
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:15,419
I think it's worth the risk and any possible hardship to say something.

618
00:34:16,142 --> 00:34:18,473
And I don't think I could live with myself if I didn't.

619
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,722
I know.

620
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:27,945
I'll see you in the morning.

621
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,480
Don't worry.

622
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:32,172
I'm not going to fall asleep out here.

623
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:33,134
Ha.

624
00:34:33,802 --> 00:34:34,402
Ha.

625
00:34:35,864 --> 00:34:36,464
Ha.

626
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:43,489
<i>Did you ever see a dream romancing</i>

627
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,280
<i>Well I did</i>

628
00:34:46,857 --> 00:34:50,719
<i>Did you ever see heaven right in your arms</i>

629
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:52,076
James! James!

630
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:56,904
Nadine!

631
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:00,907
Oh, God.

632
00:35:01,407 --> 00:35:02,160
Baby.

633
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,014
What did you do?

634
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,839
Oh...

635
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,325
Don't worry, honey.

636
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:12,809
I'm going to get you some help, okay?

637
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:16,622
James.

638
00:35:17,343 --> 00:35:17,943
James.

639
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:20,493
We have to tell.

640
00:35:21,899 --> 00:35:23,120
I can't go on.

641
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,717
I can't live this way.

642
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:29,824
What are you talking about?
Tell who?

643
00:35:30,593 --> 00:35:31,826
The police.

644
00:35:33,327 --> 00:35:35,347
She'll never leave until we do.

645
00:35:46,397 --> 00:35:49,359
<i>Did you ever see a dream walking?</i>

646
00:35:49,622 --> 00:35:55,762
<i>Well I did.
Did you ever hear a dream talking?</i>

647
00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:00,881
<i>Well I did.
Did you ever have a dream...</i>

648
00:36:08,855 --> 00:36:09,896
Did you call them?

649
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:11,431
Are they coming?

650
00:36:11,482 --> 00:36:12,142
They're coming.

651
00:36:12,983 --> 00:36:13,957
You're going to be fine.

652
00:36:17,294 --> 00:36:18,258
This was stupid,

653
00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:19,548
what I did.

654
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:22,919
I don't want to die.

655
00:36:23,074 --> 00:36:23,859
I know.

656
00:36:24,234 --> 00:36:25,566
I just wanted it to stop.

657
00:36:25,979 --> 00:36:26,886
Shh.

658
00:36:31,548 --> 00:36:32,364
Will you stay with me?

659
00:36:33,553 --> 00:36:37,546
I will. I'll stay with you till they get here.

660
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:41,823
Close your eyes, baby.

661
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:43,128
It's all right.

662
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,782
It's going to be just a few minutes.

663
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:53,490
Shh.

664
00:37:01,977 --> 00:37:02,872
Allison?

665
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:04,017
It's okay.

666
00:37:04,006 --> 00:37:04,977
It's just me.

667
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:05,893
I need to get my wallet.

668
00:37:05,944 --> 00:37:06,964
I have to go for a drive.

669
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:08,284
A drive?

670
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:10,316
It's 2:00 in the morning.

671
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:11,715
Where in the world are you going to drive to?

672
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:12,823
I need to go to that street,

673
00:37:12,874 --> 00:37:13,859
the one near the hospital.

674
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,036
This isn't over, not yet.

675
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:16,382
I just had another dream.

676
00:37:17,007 --> 00:37:18,852
Well, fine, then get back in bed, dream some more.

677
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,659
No, I can't.

678
00:37:19,888 --> 00:37:20,569
That dead girl,

679
00:37:20,634 --> 00:37:21,537
Melanie Davenport,

680
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:23,214
I think she's trying to tell me something.

681
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:42,718
You're not going to find her here.

682
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:49,032
Melanie's fine. She's safe.

683
00:37:50,081 --> 00:37:52,855
She's where she's supposed to be finally.

684
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:55,079
And how about you?

685
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:56,433
Me?

686
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,420
I'm still adjusting.

687
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,823
Getting... used to the idea.

688
00:38:04,765 --> 00:38:06,412
Trying to accept what he did.

689
00:38:13,055 --> 00:38:16,255
You know, it took me almost 27 minutes to die.

690
00:38:18,305 --> 00:38:23,584
He sat beside me holding my hand for 27 minutes while I tried to hang on,

691
00:38:26,446 --> 00:38:28,565
listening for the sirens that never came.

692
00:38:32,549 --> 00:38:34,039
But I guess I had it coming.

693
00:38:36,911 --> 00:38:41,122
I should have come forward to the police and told them what we'd done.

694
00:38:42,312 --> 00:38:43,855
That's all that Melanie wanted.

695
00:38:44,995 --> 00:38:46,238
She never meant to hurt me.

696
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,642
That day that you and I met in the restaurant--

697
00:38:52,117 --> 00:38:53,672
she arranged that you know.

698
00:38:55,452 --> 00:38:56,874
And the business with your headlight?

699
00:38:58,241 --> 00:39:01,950
She was giving me a chance to confess, a chance to live,

700
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:03,117
and I didn't take it.

701
00:39:06,084 --> 00:39:09,617
And now Melanie's parents will never know who took their child from them.

702
00:39:12,677 --> 00:39:13,915
And what happens to your husband?

703
00:39:15,804 --> 00:39:17,278
He had a chance, too.

704
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,203
Today, with you, in the room,

705
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,186
he had a chance,

706
00:39:22,644 --> 00:39:23,811
and he didn't take it.

707
00:39:28,514 --> 00:39:30,023
So now, I guess it's up to me.

708
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:34,620
I don't understand.
What are you going to do?

709
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:37,187
Obviously,
he's not afraid of ghosts.

710
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,756
He's not afraid of flickering lights or music.

711
00:39:42,425 --> 00:39:44,432
But if someone, or something,

712
00:39:46,492 --> 00:39:50,434
was to blow out the pilot light in the old stove in our kitchen,

713
00:39:52,403 --> 00:39:54,039
and James were to have a cold,

714
00:39:55,343 --> 00:39:56,603
not smell the gas,

715
00:39:57,967 --> 00:40:02,205
let it fill the room and James were to light a cigarette...

716
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,810
I wonder what those sirens are all about?

717
00:40:14,983 --> 00:40:16,221
Do you smell something?

718
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:32,789
Don't forget to bring home those names and that phone number.

719
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:33,766
I won't, Daddy.

720
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,580
Okay.

721
00:40:36,703 --> 00:40:37,704
Why isn't Mommy up?

722
00:40:38,289 --> 00:40:39,896
I like the way she pours better.

723
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,755
Mommy was out late last night doing some emergency work.

724
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:44,870
Darn.

725
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,104
Hello?

726
00:40:51,051 --> 00:40:52,846
Yes, this is her mother.

727
00:40:54,527 --> 00:40:55,182
Morning.

728
00:40:59,483 --> 00:41:00,627
What about Celeste?

729
00:41:00,678 --> 00:41:02,157
Uh, I already reminded her.

730
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,953
Well, that was her mom just now.

731
00:41:05,034 --> 00:41:07,781
She was wondering if you could pick up Celeste's homework today because

732
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:10,517
Celeste needs to go to New York for a couple of days.

733
00:41:12,075 --> 00:41:13,663
Why, what's going on?

734
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,768
I guess she has a cousin,

735
00:41:17,071 --> 00:41:19,911
a spitting image of Celeste,
only ten years older,

736
00:41:20,286 --> 00:41:22,695
and I guess she was just diagnosed with leukemia,

737
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:24,647
so they're all going there to say good-bye.

738
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:33,746
You know what?
I'm not hungry anymore.

739
00:41:33,797 --> 00:41:35,782
I'm just going to go to my room.

740
00:41:40,972 --> 00:41:42,809
I owe that girl a conversation.

741
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,304
I don't get it.

742
00:41:46,355 --> 00:41:47,356
What's going on?

743
00:41:47,688 --> 00:41:49,609
Why is everybody so serious?

744
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:52,028
It's hard to explain.

745
00:41:53,412 --> 00:41:54,971
You'll see, the older you get.

746
00:41:56,127 --> 00:41:57,035
I'll be right back.

747
00:42:00,471 --> 00:42:02,983
Well, I don't know how to tell this to you.

748
00:42:04,505 --> 00:42:06,858
I guess it's just you and me, kid.

749
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,428
