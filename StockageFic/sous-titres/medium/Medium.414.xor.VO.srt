1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,880
From the second we awaken from
a night's slumber, we depend on--

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,620
no,take for granted-- all
sorts of invisible,silent,

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,350
and violent systems that make
our modern lives possible.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,100
Take that alarm clock.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,700
Before it can do its job and
wake me up, it has to have power.

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,320
Water,coal and wind power are harnessed
by turbines and turned into...electricity,

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,190
which is then sent through cables that
are over our heads and under our feet.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,020
So it's easy to forget that at
any given time we are surrounded

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,190
by thousands or millions or billions of
volts of electricity coursing all around us.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,920
Joe? Girls? Come on! Today's a big day.

11
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:53,120
Even something as simple as frying an
egg begins thousands of feet underground

12
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:58,750
erthe se ofrehistoric plants and
animals are pulverized into gas...

13
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,540
then sucked out of the
ground and processed,

14
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,680
and then piped all across the country
through over one million miles of pipes,

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,960
all of it there to heat us and
make having a hot breakfast easier.

16
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,060
Come on,girls. Hurry
up! We're gonna be late.

17
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,850
And then there's that
modern miracle we call a car.

18
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,560
Built around the internal
combustion engine,

19
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:30,160
the average American car holds anywhere
from 12 to 16 gallons of gasoline.

20
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:36,130
That's somewhere between 100 and 150
pounds of instantly combustible liquid.

21
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,890
It also contains a battery and at
least six to eight quarts of oil.

22
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,500
If you stop and think about it,
taken as the sum of itsparts,

23
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,910
it's really a rolling bomb,

24
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,250
equipped with stereophonic
sound and adjustable seats.

25
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,240
But we don't do that.

26
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,930
We don't think of it in pieces.
We think of it as a whole.

27
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,490
It's a car. Our car.

28
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,570
And we love it.

Car Trouble</font>

32
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,280
- Hey,Ariel?
- Yeah?

33
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,830
Did you ever notice that on the
cereal box, there's a picture of a kid,

34
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,480
sitting at a table eating cereal,
and on that table is a cereal box,

35
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,490
and on that cereal box
is a picture of a kid,

36
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,620
sitting at a table eating cereal,

37
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,620
and on that table is another
cereal box, and on that box...

38
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,560
- Dad,you have to make her stop.
- Bridge,stop.

39
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,470
What? I'm just trying to find out.

40
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,290
Do you think they go on forever?

41
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,320
Do you think the cereal boxes just keep
going and getting smaller and smaller

42
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,700
till there's one just
the size of a molecule?

43
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,500
You know,when you go under water in the
bathtub, you're staying down there too long.

44
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,170
Ariel...

45
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,960
Why? Because you don't know the answer?

46
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,330
Do you girls know where your mother is?

47
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,320
I know the answer. I'm
just not wasting it on you.

48
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,560
Honey,do you know where your mommy is?

49
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,850
Allison?

50
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,840
What are you doing out here?

51
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,810
Sorry.

52
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,360
Uh,what are you doing out here?

53
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,460
You're not going to believe
this, but I had a crazy dream.

54
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,510
You don't say.

55
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,470
I-I was taking the kids to school,
and they climbed in the car,

56
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,520
and I turned the key, and it blew up.

57
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,660
What do you mean,blew up?

58
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,430
Okay,Allison, that's crazy.
I mean,cars-- they-they...

59
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,500
Cars don't just blow up.

60
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,340
Not unless somebody puts
a bomb underneath them.

61
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,950
Or forgets to put in oil in,
and the engine catches on fire.

62
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,890
I mean,cars don't just blow up.

63
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,430
Yeah,I know that. I do.

64
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,230
That's why I came out here. I just...

65
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,060
I figured, I'll just sit in the
car. I'll turn the key and prove it.

66
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,900
Okay.

67
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,160
The thing is, I just... I can't do it.

68
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,930
I've been sitting out here
for 15 minutes. I just can't.

69
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,190
I can't get my hand to turn the key.

70
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,190
Okay,Allison, get out of the car.

71
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,540
Why? What are you going to do?

72
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,030
I'm going to slide in and turn the key.

73
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,940
You can't do that.

74
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,810
You could kill our kids.

75
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,260
You could kill yourself,
kill me,destroy our house.

76
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,790
Allison...

77
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,910
I dreamt it.

78
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,770
What are you doing?

79
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,370
Where-Where are you going?

80
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,870
I'm gonna round up our kids.

81
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,300
I'm gonna go stand on the corner with
them while you try to start the car.

82
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,310
Well,hold on a second.

83
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,770
Mom,I don't understand.

84
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,040
Why are we standing on the
corner staring at our own house?

85
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,610
It's kind of hard to explain.

86
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,960
It's stupid.

87
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,770
Never mind!

88
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,940
Don't do it!

89
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,130
Joe!

90
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,450
Answer me!

91
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,270
Dad?

92
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,010
Joe,don't turn that key! Joe!

93
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,710
Do not turn that key!

94
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,350
You guys calling me?

95
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,840
Thank God you didn't do it.

96
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,650
Do what, sweetie?

97
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,620
Sweetie,hey,hey, hey,it's okay.

98
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,120
I've just been trying to turn the
car on for the last five minutes.

99
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:26,960
It's dead. It won't do anything.

100
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,210
It won't start,won't click,won't
turn over. Nothing. It's dead.

101
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,970
Don't worry.

102
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,120
Okay,thanks. Gracias.

103
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,950
Well,that was fun.

104
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,330
All of us in the car
together,going to school.

105
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,530
Dropping off the girls.

106
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,540
So,if you're going to take
the car to go meet Scanlon,

107
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,380
how am I going to get home tonight?

108
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,590
Well,just call me when you're ready.

109
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,500
I'll ask Ariel to watch the
girls, and I'll come and get you.

110
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,830
Okay,I suppose that works.

111
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,680
Um,all right,so I guess I'll call
you once I hear from the mechanic.

112
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,560
I'll fill you in.

113
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,860
Hey,this is great! I'm early.

114
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,440
I just realized, I don't have to
drop you off. I can come in with you.

115
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,610
I can see your new
office, see where you work.

116
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,460
You sure you want to do that?

117
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,290
That's an awful lot of excitement
for this early hour in the morning.

118
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,380
This is nice.

119
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,660
Oh,yes,we have it all.

120
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,930
Floors,ceiling,window.

121
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,210
Which one's yours?

122
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,950
Hey,I got a good feeling.

123
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,840
Oh,that's static electricity. That's
your feet dragging on the carpet.

124
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,150
Hey,where you going?
Allison? What are you doing?

125
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,180
Hey,Allison?

126
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,300
She's got a picture of her
boyfriend on her desk! We like that.

127
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,310
Hey,don't do that. Don't go in there.

128
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,290
She's pretty! You never told
me that she was so pretty.

129
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,160
Allison,I beg of you,
get out of her office!

130
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,130
She's going to walk through
that front door any second.

131
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,500
If you're going to be a
successful entrepreneur,

132
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,690
- you better learn to calm down.
- Come on!

133
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,290
Thank you.

134
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,440
What's the big deal? Everybody does it.

135
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,850
Mrs. Dubois?

136
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,460
Allison.

137
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,960
Meghan Doyle.

138
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,550
So nice to finally meet you.

139
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,960
Yeah,it's nice to finally meet you.

140
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,870
I recognized you from the
pictures on Joe's desk.

141
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,960
So this is nice. Special occasion?

142
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,960
Uh,no. We just,you
know, decided to carpool.

143
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,060
Um,actually, I need to get going.

144
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,590
I'll walk you to the car.

145
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,630
We should get together
for dinner one night.

146
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,580
That-That would be fun. It
was nice finally meeting you.

147
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,130
Nice meeting you,Allison.

148
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,420
Well,she's very pretty.

149
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,060
Well let's try not to
hold that against her.

150
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,980
So,wait a second. You're saying that the
entire electrical system needs to be replaced?

151
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,640
Well,how much is that going to cost?

152
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,220
You're kidding me.

153
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,140
I don't think the car cost
that when we bought it.

154
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,710
No,don't start work on the car,
not until you hear back from me.

155
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,730
Oh,yeah?

156
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,800
Well,that's serendipitous.

157
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,370
Sorry,Ricky. I'm going
to have to call you back.

158
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,490
Um,but I'm very interested.

159
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,770
Okay,I will. I will call. Bye.

160
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,200
Sorry. Car place.

161
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,770
My wife's car is,like,
dead to the world.

162
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,750
Sorry. That's not why
you came to see me.

163
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,680
The company that's doing our
patent search just called me.

164
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,370
We're completely clear
everywhere in North America.

165
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,300
South America looks fine,Asia.

166
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,330
But he's worried that there
may be a patent filed in

167
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,880
what they used to refer to as
one of the Eastern Bloc countries.

168
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,590
He wouldn't be specific with me,but
they have free market economies now.

169
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,490
They're trading partners,competitors.

170
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,200
So,if somebody already
beat us to the punch,

171
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,230
in let's say the Czech Republic...

172
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,330
So wait a second. What are you saying?

173
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,210
Are you saying that they think that somebody
in Eastern Europe already came up with my idea?

174
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,990
What does that mean?

175
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,030
It means...

176
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,350
it's a good thing all
this furniture is rented.

177
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,280
It means we wait.

178
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,920
I don't know what it means.

179
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,970
I'm hoping it that
doesn't mean anything.

180
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,640
I'm hoping,in a day or two, once they've
finished their research, it means nothing.

181
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,120
That's what I'm hoping.

182
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,070
Don't panic. I'm a friendly burglar.

183
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,260
I'm even bringing in the mail.

184
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,370
Hey,what are you doing home?

185
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,990
I thought you were going
to call me for a ride.

186
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,170
Did they fix my car yet?

187
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,020
Uh,no,they didn't.

188
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,360
Okay,so how'd you get home?

189
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,660
And why do you have that
funny look on your face?

190
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,660
- Ah,well,therein lies a tale.
- Really.

191
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,380
Yes.And though it begins quite sadly,

192
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,350
'tis a tale with a
happy ending, methinks.

193
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,470
Mom, why is Dad talking funny?

194
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,730
I don't know.

195
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,290
Um,your car, I'm afraid,has
shuffled off this mortal coil.

196
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,080
What does that mean? They can't fix it?

197
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:34,630
Uh,well, anything can be fixed, but it would
cost more than it's actually worth to do it.

198
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,280
Well,Joe,I love that car.

199
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,360
I know you do,babe.

200
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,110
Honey,that's the first
car we bought together.

201
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,710
We brought our daughters home
from the hospital in that car.

202
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,510
I know.

203
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,470
But remember how I said that
this story had a happy ending?

204
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,060
Okay,so the mechanic,
who was fixing our car,

205
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,960
he called me,and he told me that he'd
just put new tires on a pristine SUV

206
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,810
that the owner was
looking to get rid of.

207
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,040
- For a steal.
- For a steal?

208
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,020
Yeah. I mean,this thing,this,
I mean this car is...

209
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,850
is big. It's clean. It's roomy.

210
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,080
It's got all kinds of things
that your car never had.

211
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,860
Navigation. CD player. Cup holders.

212
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,160
Cup holders? I do love cup holders.

213
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,100
I don't know. A used car.

214
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,680
Well,I know, honey, but the truth
is we can't afford a new one.

215
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,220
And this car really isn't that used.

216
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,880
Yeah,okay,but,you know, it
belonged to somebody else.

217
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,900
It had a past life with somebody else.

218
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,010
But I'm telling you, this car looks like
it just came right off the showroom floor.

219
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,080
So,you've seen it?

220
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,440
Actually,I drove it.

221
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,250
Actually,I bought it.

222
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,390
I know it was wrong
to buy it without you.

223
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,120
Just it seemed too good to be true.

224
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,190
- It's pretty in here.
- My car seat's already in here!

225
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,020
Is this car that I'm going
to drive when I turn 16?

226
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,560
Our mechanic called and told me what
time the guy was going to get there--

227
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,210
the guy who owned it to pick it
up-- and so I just went over there.

228
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,140
I was just having one of those
days where everything went wrong

229
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,740
and then I saw this car
and it just seemed so right.

230
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,290
It's kind of a big
change being this high.

231
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,300
Now,look, if you don't like this, you
can take my car and I'll take this.

232
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,200
Come on,girls. Hop in! We're going
to take this baby for a test drive.

233
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,500
I call the front!

234
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,050
- I call the back!
- I call the back,too.

235
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,930
Seat belts!

236
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,210
- Seat belt.
- Buckle up.

237
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,880
Sounds nice!

238
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,330
Hey,can you check the spaghetti?

239
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,310
No problem.

240
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,360
Now don't go too far.

241
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,980
Remember, none of you have passports.

242
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,750
Say good-bye to Daddy,girls.
We may never see him again.

243
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,220
Bye,Dad!

244
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,330
So I guess now we wait.

245
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,490
What exactly are we waiting for?

246
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,320
Uh,for the patent folks to check the records
of all those Eastern European countries.

247
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,000
And that'll take?

248
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,810
Oh,I don't know. A day or two.

249
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,170
We should know something, uh,tomorrow
night. Or the night after that.

250
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,930
The time difference doesn't help.

251
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,030
All right,so I'm going to
ask the obvious question.

252
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,750
You know,if everything could go away
tomorrow, should we really be buying a car?

253
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,480
I don't know. Probably isn't very smart.

254
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,090
Just felt great.

255
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,440
I can't explain it.
It's just been so hard.

256
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,940
Not being able to buy anything.

257
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,330
And not being able to do
anything for my family.

258
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,120
I love that car.

259
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,720
It's a beautiful car.

260
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,550
I was actually thinking I'd
like to go sit in it some more.

261
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,610
- You want to?
- No.

262
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,130
I'm telling you,Joe.

263
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,740
Someone was shot in that car! A woman.

264
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,870
She was sitting in the
seat right next to me.

265
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,550
Well,I'm sorry,honey, but I
don't think that's possible.

266
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,950
I mean,what I mean to say is
I-I did a records check on it.

267
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,240
One of those online
things and nothing came up.

268
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,730
Of course nothing came up!

269
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,390
Those things are supposed to tell you
if a car's in a collision or an accident.

270
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,820
Not something like this.

271
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,860
No wonder this car was such a bargain.

272
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,370
Well,hold on a second.
Wait,wait,wait, wait,wait,wait.

273
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,480
Look... be fair here.

274
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,090
There's nothing wrong
with the car itself.

275
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,430
It had no way of knowing it was
going to end up being driven by you.

276
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,320
Excuse me.

277
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,170
All right,okay. Hold on a
second. That came out wrong.

278
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,620
- What I'm trying to say...
- No,I know what you're trying to say.

279
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,460
But I'm not the problem
here. This car is haunted.

280
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:15,560
And I cannot, I will not drive it again,
much less ask my children to sit in it.

281
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,030
All right. All right.
Fine. Okay. I hear you.

282
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,720
First thing in the morning, I'll drive
it back to the guy that I bought it from.

283
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,800
I'll see if I can convince
him to give me my money back.

284
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,740
Thank you.

285
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,550
In the meantime, you
drive the kids in my car.

286
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,160
Thank you.

287
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,490
Hello. Well,what do you know?

288
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,630
If it isn't the fella who
robbed me blind yesterday.

289
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,810
I'm sorry to drop in like this.

290
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,800
Oh,it's okay. In fact,
I was going to call you.

291
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,100
Forgot to give you a couple of things.

292
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,630
Cigarette lighter, extra key,
little jar of touch-up paint.

293
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,100
I appreciate that.

294
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,890
The thing is,um, I got a problem.

295
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,870
Okay. What kind of problem?

296
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,930
Well,it's my wife,um...

297
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,340
She's not crazy about the car.

298
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,980
Really?

299
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,300
Do you think maybe she just
needs some time to get used to it?

300
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,750
If only it were that simple.

301
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,600
Well,I'm sorry, but I
don't know what to tell you.

302
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,490
Well,I was hoping you'd tell
me that you hadn't sent the,uh,

303
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,820
notice of sale in to the DMV yet.

304
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,370
Well,I have.

305
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,180
But it wouldn't have made
any difference if I hadn't.

306
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,640
If you'll excuse me, I have to
go in now. Get ready for work.

307
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,480
Uh,well,the thing is,uh, I don't know if
it's the same with cars,but with houses,

308
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,470
when you sell 'em, you're obligated
to disclose certain things.

309
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,560
Like if there's been a... a
recent death on the premises.

310
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,040
Okay. So what'd you do?

311
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,640
You Google me or something?

312
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,930
You figure now that you know, you can come
back here, maybe I'll cut the price even more?

313
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,520
I'm not looking for a bargain.

314
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,110
I just want to give you the
car back. Get my money back.

315
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,300
Pretend the whole thing never
happened. I'm sorry if I upset you.

316
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,640
Do you know what happened?

317
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,530
My wife,uh, did the research. I just...

318
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,150
My wife was killed in that car. Shot.

319
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,520
While I watched.

320
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,520
It was a carjacking.

321
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,220
Not three miles from here.

322
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,900
Coming back from a
movie. Stopped at a light.

323
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,620
This guy comes out
of nowhere with a gun.

324
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,430
Told us to get out of the car.

325
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,590
I can remember my hand reaching for
the door when I heard her say it.

326
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,310
"Floor it,Tim. Floor it."

327
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,490
Stupid me. I listened to her.

328
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,760
I can't really blame him for
not wanting to take it back.

329
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,780
I know. I feel terrible for him.

330
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,130
So what are we going to do?

331
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,030
Well,I don't know.All I
can think to do is sell it.

332
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,750
- Oh,make it someone else's problem.
- Allison.

333
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,040
Well,it doesn't seem right.

334
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,340
Yeah,it's actually a great car.

335
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,630
If you say so.

336
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,600
Well,I do say so.

337
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:54,040
And besides we can't afford to buy
another car until we get rid of this one.

338
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:57,450
With any luck whoever buys it is going
to be as blissfully unintuitive as I am.

339
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,800
That's not funny.

340
00:19:58,810 --> 00:19:59,580
It's not meant to be funny.

341
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,710
Allison,look, if you hadn't told me
about Rory Carmer's ghost riding shotgun,

342
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,280
I'd be driving it around right now thinking
it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.

343
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,810
Oh,right. So now it's my fault?

344
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,200
I'm not saying that. I'm just saying...

345
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,980
Look,you,you know what I'm saying.

346
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,840
I know. We have to sell it.

347
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:17,960
Um,yes. Hold on,hold
on, sweetie,hold on.

348
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,600
Yeah,well,we will. We
will. As soon as we can.

349
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,360
Well,what does that mean?

350
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,940
Well,that's the other thing I found out.

351
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,420
Looks like we're going to be stuck
with it. For at least a couple of weeks.

352
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,360
Why?

353
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,340
Well,because we can't legally
sell it until we have the title.

354
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,450
And I called the DMV and,uh, they're still
like two weeks away from mailing it to us.

355
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,840
This is a fantastic phone call.

356
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,170
Oh,yeah,we aim to please.

357
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,960
Look,Allison,you'll just have to drive my
car and I'll drive the hearse, all right?

358
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,300
It's not the end of the world.

359
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,740
I just,I miss my old car.

360
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,580
Well,that's a productive point of view.

361
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,620
- Look,I-I should really
get to work. - Okay.

362
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,460
- All right, I'll talk to you later.
- Bye.

363
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,180
- More car trouble,huh?
- Yeah.

364
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,580
I heard you guys going at it.

365
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,120
Oh,no,no,no,no. We weren't...

366
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,320
She's not terribly happy
with the car that I bought.

367
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,790
And the truth is I shouldn't
have bought it without her.

368
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,140
Ah,but this too will pass.

369
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,910
Um,it's not like we
had a fight or anything.

370
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,720
Okay. If you say so.

371
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,960
What?

372
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,860
You don't get to be my age and still
single and not know what a fight is.

373
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,020
But you're right. It will pass.

374
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:31,010
Had one myself last night and I'm
expecting the make-up phone call any minute.

375
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,490
Looking forward to it,in fact.

376
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,350
So,how are the drawings coming?

377
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,990
They're coming.

378
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,380
Uh,is there any news
on our patent search?

379
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,880
'Cause I gotta tell you, I really
didn't sleep very well last night.

380
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,020
- All right,the drawings.
- Drawings.

381
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,180
It's all here. 911
calls,forensics report,everything.

382
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,360
You mind telling me what
you want all this for?

383
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:08,390
I don't know. I started thinking maybe
this whole car thing happened for a reason.

384
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,780
Maybe I'm supposed to help
find this woman's killer,

385
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,610
bring him to justice so he can
never do this to anyone ever again.

386
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,120
Well,good luck. A lot of good
detectives already spent months on this.

387
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,860
I'll be at my desk if you need me.

388
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,250
Oh,my God,she's...
she's-she's not breathing.

389
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,660
I don't think she's breathing!

390
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,360
Sir,what is your location?

391
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,990
Uh,we're,like,three blocks south of
the Fantasy Theatre on-on that big road

392
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,030
that runs parallel to the freeway.

393
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,830
Okay,the man with the gun-- did you see
which direction he came from,Mr. Carmer?

394
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,700
Um,no.

395
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,530
Uh,I was adjusting the radio,
looking... looking for a station.

396
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,050
My wife loved classical music...

397
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,360
We pulled up to the light,
and-and there he was.

398
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,400
Was he white? Black? Latino?

399
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,870
Uh,it was dark.

400
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,420
And-And I-I don't want to
get this wrong. I mean...

401
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:02,060
he could have been white,
but I-I think he was Latino.

402
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,110
Sorry to interrupt.

403
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,650
One of the other
detectives needs the room.

404
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,930
I'm gonna have to ask you to clear out.

405
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,220
I think I saw him,Lee.*******

406
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,220
Hey,Al,it's... I'm
sorry. Did I wake you?

407
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,890
Hey,listen,sweetie,
how-how crazy is this?

408
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:29,380
Uh,it's-it's 10:00 at night, and I just now
realized that I don't have my wallet in my pocket.

409
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,910
Um,where are you? In the living room.

410
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,300
Hey,do me a favor-- just go by... go in the
kitchen and see if it's... if it's by the phone.

411
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,330
Yeah. Yeah,I can hold on...

412
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,810
Okay. Oh,good, good,good,okay.

413
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,030
No,no,no,no,no. I don't
need you to bring it to me.

414
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,690
I just need to know that it's there.

415
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:54,090
Yeah. Uh,it-it may be a while
still,sweetie. I'm sorry.

416
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,530
Miss you.

417
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,890
I thought you were with the boyfriend.

418
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,080
Best-laid plans...

419
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:06,440
Or not laid,as the case may be.

420
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:11,830
No,actually,I got a call
in the middle of dinner.

421
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,090
It turns out there's no
one in the whole wide world

422
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,480
as inventive as Joe Dubois.

423
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,340
What are you saying? Are you saying
the patent people finally called?

424
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,300
Are you saying the idea's
in the free and clear?

425
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,720
I'm saying... that we're
in business,partner.

426
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:36,400
We have a prototype to
build, a future to forge.

427
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,570
That is great news.

428
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,760
Now you probably want to get
back to your boyfriend, celebrate.

429
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,860
No.

430
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:50,480
Is that the best idea you have?

431
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,810
I mean,that doesn't
sound very inventive.

432
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:00,720
That doesn't sound like
much of a celebration.

433
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,590
Hello.

434
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,670
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

435
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,560
No,you didn't wake me.

436
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,050
I just now realized that
I don't have my wallet.

437
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,510
Your wallet?

438
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,430
Yeah. Hold on.

439
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,600
Allison.

440
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,940
What-What are you doing here?

441
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,920
I told you you didn't have
to come all the way down here.

442
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,220
No. I know. I wanted to.

443
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,130
Couldn't sleep. Thought
I'd take a drive.

444
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,310
Is something wrong? Don't go in there.

445
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,780
No. I don't know.

446
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,100
Where's Meghan?

447
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,180
Oh,I don't know. She
went home hours ago.

448
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,950
She's the money. I'm the brains.

449
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,110
She leaves early. I stay
late. America,America.

450
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,650
- Here.
- Thank you.

451
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,020
How about I follow you home?

452
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,760
I'd like that.

453
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,400
And you'll view the
suspects from in here.

454
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:12,670
You'll be able to see them and hear
them, but they won't be able to see you.

455
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,050
Mr. Carmer,I'd like to introduce you
to an associate of mine, Allison Dubois.

456
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,950
Allison,this is Tim Carmer.

457
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,080
Dubois? Are you any relation to...

458
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,290
Joe's my husband.

459
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,200
Actually,Mrs. Dubois here was instrumental in
getting us to take another look at your case.

460
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,730
She actually pointed us
towards a possible suspect that,

461
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,930
uh, we missed the first time around.

462
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,970
I,uh,consult with the police department,

463
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,790
so when my husband mentioned that
your wife's murder was unsolved...

464
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:38,920
My God,that's... nice of you.

465
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,970
I was stunned when the
detective called me this morning.

466
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,500
I had given up any hope of ever
finding the man who did this.

467
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:47,580
Well,we can't actually be sure
we've found him yet,Mr. Carmer.

468
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,400
Not until you identify him.

469
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,980
Should we give this a whirl?

470
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,870
Take as much time as you need.

471
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,720
Could you ask #3 to step
a little closer,please?

472
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,920
#3,could you step forward,please?

473
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,790
I'm sorry. I just can't be sure.

474
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,020
Uh,I just don't get it.

475
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,420
I see him so clearly in my head,Joe.

476
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,380
I know,honey,but it's not
your word they're looking for.

477
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,830
Um,so,listen...

478
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,150
uh,I spoke to our
mechanic about the SUV,

479
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,490
and he actually has somebody
else who might be interested.

480
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,140
Um,the guy wants to come by
and see it tomorrow afternoon.

481
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,530
Thing is,he doesn't want to drive
all the way downtown to my office.

482
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,110
He'd rather come here.

483
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,930
Um,is there any chance we could carpool in
the morning so the car will be here for him?

484
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,810
Well,sure.

485
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,420
As long as I don't have to get in it.

486
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,340
No,you don't have to get in it.

487
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,220
I think the guy just wants
to see what it looks like.

488
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,940
The mechanic already has him
convinced it runs like a top.

489
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:23,840
You know what-what was nice?

490
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,380
Do you know what was nice?

491
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:30,100
The way you showed up
at the office last night.

492
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,780
Just kind of out of nowhere.

493
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:37,480
I mean,I told you I didn't actually need
the wallet, but you brought it over anyway.

494
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,260
That was nice.

495
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,660
I... I have a confession to make.

496
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:50,560
Oh,really? We like
confessions. Is it juicy?

497
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,240
Not really.

498
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,140
I,uh...

499
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,390
I fell asleep on the couch last night.

500
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,090
I had a dream just before you
called to ask about your wallet.

501
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,960
Okay. Something you want to share?

502
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,350
In the dream,

503
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,370
you heard about your idea
from the patent people.

504
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:15,970
No one else had thought of it. No
one else in the whole wide world.

505
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:21,740
And... you and Meghan
were really happy about it.

506
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,860
That why I brought you your wallet.

507
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:31,780
I thought, maybe it's really
going to happen tonight.

508
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,860
And I don't want to miss it.

509
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,590
I want to be there
when he's really happy.

510
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,070
So,now,what does this mean?

511
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,920
I mean,is there a statute of dream
limitations on these kind of things?

512
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,540
When will I hear about the patent?

513
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:50,080
And is it going to come true?
Is-Is the news going to be good?

514
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,200
I don't know. I'm the woman who said
that her car was going to blow up.

515
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,410
Well,that's not very encouraging.

516
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,300
Recognize him?

517
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,460
This is our guy. My guy.

518
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,050
The man from the lineup yesterday.

519
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,980
I-I don't understand.

520
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,240
He's a model, a male model.

521
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,880
Oh,when he isn't, uh,carjacking
and killing people, you mean?

522
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,040
Well,I can't vouch for that,
but,uh,I did do some checking,

523
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,350
and a lot of other people
can vouch for the fact

524
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,350
that this fellow wasn't even in Phoenix
on the night that Mrs. Carmer was shot.

525
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,820
Apparently,he was in Los Angeles on
some kind of a modeling assignment.

526
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,600
A model?

527
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:35,320
I saw him in the mug book you gave me.

528
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:38,160
He looks exactly like the
man I keep seeing in my head.

529
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,530
Well,he was in the mug
book because,uh,apparently,

530
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:44,530
he feels the need to augment his modeling
income with the occasional petty theft.

531
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,620
Some of that might be because he's also
trying to support a minor drug habit.

532
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,230
I don't know what to tell you,Allison.

533
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,870
The answer to the question, "Who killed
Rory Carmer?" is not this fellow here.

534
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,480
You're going to make
me get in,aren't you?

535
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:46,370
Route guidance is now active.

536
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:51,490
Destination ahead 7.9 miles.

537
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,290
Destination ahead 7.9 miles.

538
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,290
Destination ahead 7.9 miles.

539
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,350
Your route guidance will start now.

540
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:26,190
Destination ahead 5.3 miles.

541
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:38,610
Home is ahead one-quarter mile.

542
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,340
Home?

543
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,840
Right turn ahead.

544
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,660
Turn right now.

545
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,450
Home is 100 feet ahead on the right.

546
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,870
You are home.

547
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,770
Not my home.

548
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,110
Oh,my gosh!

549
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,000
Turn right now.

550
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,810
Wait. What are you talking
about? Turn right where?

551
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,840
Turn right now.

552
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,550
Turn right now.

553
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:42,740
Your destination is ahead in 20 feet.

554
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,670
Ten feet.

555
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,080
Five feet.

556
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,540
Three feet.

557
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,450
Destination nine inches ahead.

558
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,500
Destination four inches ahead.

559
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:14,290
You have arrived at your destination.

560
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,580
Help!

561
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,630
Please! Somebody!

562
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,720
I can't believe I let you drag me
to that movie in the first place.

563
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,890
Not only was it moronic, it
was long. Look at the time.

564
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,370
I'm sorry you didn't like the film,dear.

565
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,550
What on earth? Not a second one.

566
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,320
This way you know how
far over you can be.

567
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:33,570
As if I don't know how to park
my own car in my own garage.

568
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,770
When did you put this
nonsense up anyway?

569
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:38,190
This afternoon.

570
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,980
That's why you parked my car in the
driveway and let the sprinklers get it wet.

571
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,670
Oh,for goodness' sakes...

572
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,100
Wait. I haven't shown
you the best part yet.

573
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,260
What,Tim? What is the best part?

574
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:53,350
Look. Over there.

575
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,820
I-I-I don't
see anything.

576
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,520
Inside the vise. Do you see?

577
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,610
What is that? It
almost looks like a gun.

578
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,900
It is. It is a gun.

579
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,050
What on earth is that doing there?

580
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,450
Watch.

581
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,490
Hey,thanks for giving me a ride,Lee.

582
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,330
I didn't know who else to call.

583
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,470
Joe doesn't have a car today.

584
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,770
It's fine,Allison.

585
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,960
I'm still trying to make sense
out of everything you just told me.

586
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,480
You and me both.

587
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,740
So let's say that is what happened.

588
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:15,170
Let's say he did kill
her. How do we prove it?

589
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,770
I-I don't know. Get a
search warrant, find the gun.

590
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,230
No judge is going to give me a warrant
on the basis of a dream or a hallucination

591
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,390
or whatever it was you had back there.

592
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,870
Frankly,I'd be amazed
if he still had the gun.

593
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,610
Might be some blowback on the vise we could tie
to whatever they recover from the car,but still.

594
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:37,150
I'll never get a warrant to take a
forensics team in there and find out.

595
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,730
Boy,I'd love to talk to him again;
love to take a look around that garage.

596
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,150
Well,it's wide open.

597
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,050
The car's sitting right there.
The keys are in the ignition...

598
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,040
if the garage hasn't
closed itself already.

599
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,550
That's certainly going to freak
him out when he gets back from work.

600
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,100
I'd expect some angry
phone calls tonight.

601
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,140
I guess he heard you.

602
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,440
Hello?

603
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,330
Allison,what the hell's going on?

604
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,110
What do you mean? What
are you talking about?

605
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,740
The guy I told you about came by
the house to see the car today.

606
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,620
He couldn't find anything.
He couldn't find you.

607
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,020
Oh,my God. I'm so sorry,Joe.

608
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:20,180
I don't even know... how to begin.

609
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,530
Well,it doesn't matter
now. He's never coming back.

610
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,540
Hey,when you coming home?
When can I come pick you up?

611
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:30,180
When the time comes, I'll
probably just take a cab.

612
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,680
It might not be until really late.

613
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:35,760
We got word the patent
guys might call tonight.

614
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:39,910
She's got a,um, she's
got a date and I'm...

615
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,340
since I'm the minority partner, I've
got to sit and baby-sit the phones.

616
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,070
I don't get it. Why do they have
to call in the middle of the night?

617
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,900
Why can't they call your cell?

618
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:51,110
Allison,I don't know. It's Eastern
Europe. There's a time difference.

619
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,390
I don't know why she didn't
give them my cell,but she didn't.

620
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,250
Look,I've got to go now.

621
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,240
I'm sorry about the car.

622
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:01,000
Oh,we'll figure it out.

623
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,430
Thanks for the ride,Lee.
Thanks for everything.

624
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,620
Hey,you know what?

625
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,820
You need someone to pick up the SUV
from Carmer,right? It's still yours.

626
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:20,380
Maybe I'll drop by Carmer's tonight,
drive over there with another officer.

627
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,590
Say we're there to pick up the car.

628
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,170
Use it as an excuse to
go through the garage.

629
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,670
You get your car back.
Maybe I get some evidence.

630
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,630
Oh,my God, that would be amazing.

631
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,550
Power.

632
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,720
It takes many forms,
revealing itself in many ways.

633
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,660
"At the bottom of a hill
lived Jack and his mother.

634
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:46,160
"And by the side of their little cottage,
Jack had planted a very large bean."

635
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,440
Is this Jack and the Beanstalk?

636
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,300
That's a boy story,Mom.
You can't read a boy story.

637
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:55,230
- Dad's got to read that.
- Yeah,that's a boy story.

638
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,450
The idea that a waterfall
a thousand miles away

639
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,110
makes it possible for me to
turn on a lamp seems like magic.

640
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,140
That I can fill a bathtub with hot
water in the middle of the night

641
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:08,130
makes no logical sense,either.

642
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,410
Electricity,serendipity...

643
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:17,500
they both surround us, both doing
their work silently, invisibly.

644
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,180
Lee?

645
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,430
You hear something?

646
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,670
Hello?

647
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,920
You love me?

648
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:41,490
Of course I love you.

649
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:45,000
Did you get your call?
Are you coming home?

650
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,160
No,no,and yes.

651
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:50,340
I got another call. I
found a buyer for the SUV.

652
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,740
You're kidding?

653
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:57,800
it turns out that mechanic is serious about
how much he loves Carmer's death-mobile.

654
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,290
He wants to buy it.

655
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,550
And he's willing to pay us
$500 more than we paid Carmer,

656
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,730
which is a good thing because
I think we're going to need it.

657
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,850
What do you mean? What for?

658
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:12,310
He thinks I'm nuts and I think I'm nuts, but
I told him to go ahead and fix your old car.

659
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,980
Joe,that is so exciting!
That is fantastic!

660
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:20,260
Honey,hold on a second.
I'm getting another call.

661
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,860
Hello?

662
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:24,030
Allison,it's Lee. You sitting down?

663
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,160
Well,kind of.

664
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,530
He's dead,Allison.

665
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,200
What are you talking about?

666
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,090
Tim Carmer,he died from
carbon monoxide poisoning.

667
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:38,510
When we got here,we noticed the garage
door was down, locked up tight as a drum.

668
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,460
You could hear the SUV running in there.

669
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:44,110
Oh,my God.

670
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:49,090
I just kept thinking about that story you
told me this afternoon, and wondering...

671
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,020
was this something he did to himself?

672
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:57,520
Or you think maybe
he,uh... It's crazy,right?

673
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:05,690
Hey,Al,you still there?

674
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,870
It's okay. I think...
I think I lost her.

675
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:17,370
I thought you were
out with the boyfriend.

676
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,600
Best-laid plans...

677
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:22,370
Or not laid,as the case may be.
