Previously on Medium:

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,460
Sorry to interrupt.

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,510
Alison Dubois, this is Special...

4
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,980
Edward Cooper, of the FBI.

5
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,940
I'm very familiar with your work,sir.

6
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,720
I had a dream about this guy last night.

7
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,350
What's he got that I don't?

8
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,530
An amazing reputation as a
criminal profiler, for one thing.

9
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,530
You see things,don't you?

10
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,380
I dedicated myself to getting
inside the minds of killers.

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,000
It wasn't my choice.

12
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,190
You go into the heads of murderers
whether you want to or not.

13
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,690
I know what you did.

14
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,890
I know you put two
bullets into Richard Gomez,

15
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,160
and I will find a way to expose you.

16
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,970
Housekeeping!

17
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,240
You want turn-down service?

21
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,270
as of now,my combi. the combination of my amplification
mirror optics and unique software logarithms

22
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,510
make a consumer-grade solar
cell 10% more efficient.

23
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,250
At least 10% more efficient.

24
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,930
With additional funding, I think I can get
that number closer to 15,maybe even 20%.

25
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,600
Very impressive.

26
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,940
I'd fund your project.

27
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,120
Really?

28
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,310
And how much money do you have?

29
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,040
Including the redeemable bottles I'm
bringing back to the market, about $17.

30
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,750
You know what? I'm gonna
stick with Buchanon-Lockhart.

31
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,680
I think they're gonna
want to fund you,too.

32
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,360
Oh,they'd better.

33
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,480
They're the only venture capital
firm I could get a meeting with.

34
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,610
If this presentation doesn't go well,

35
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,350
I'm pretty much gonna have to hold
a bake sale to raise the capital.

36
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,420
You reading Cooper's book again?

37
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,150
I was just thumbing through
it when you were in the shower.

38
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,960
I just can't get that
dream out of my head.

39
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,010
I tried calling the FBI this morning.

40
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,420
They wouldn't tell me where he
was or what he was working on.

41
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,360
Well,I guess they're not in the habit of

42
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,550
supplying the whereabouts of
their agents to anyone who asks.

43
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,270
Guess not.

44
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,300
Well,even if you could
find him,what would you do?

45
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,450
What would you say to him?

46
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,840
How are you gonna stop whatever
it is you saw from happening?

47
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,930
You know the drill. This
guy-- he kills killers.

48
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,190
It's still killing.

49
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,710
No,I know. I just... I-I...
You know,you're right.

50
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,710
And you did let him
get away with it once.

51
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,920
Yeah. Don't think that
hasn't kept me up nights.

52
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,810
Mom!

53
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,080
Mom,I need you!

54
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,210
Bridgette's wiggling her
teeth while I'm trying to eat.

55
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,670
So what? Do you have a problem with
a kid trying to make some extra money?

56
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,430
Okay. What is the matter?

57
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,080
What is the commotion all about?

58
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,930
Bridgette's teeth are loose and she's wiggling them
with her fingers trying to get them to come out.

59
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,090
It's disgusting.

60
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,250
It is not disgusting if each of these
teeth is worth a dollar under my pillow.

61
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,530
Bridgette,honey, you're supposed to just
wait for your teeth to fall out on their own.

62
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,750
You're not supposed to use
your fingers to loosen them.

63
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,990
I don't know,Mom.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,940
I've been hearing about how
bad the economy is and...

65
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,960
hereI am,sitting on 26 bucks.
I can make a difference.

66
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,180
That's the stupidest
thing I have ever heard.

67
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,580
All right,stop it.
Stop it,stop it. Listen.

68
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,070
Daddy has a really big day.

69
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,500
I want no more commotion.
I want no tugging.

70
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,010
I want no nuh-uh'ing. I want silence.

71
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,320
I'm here because the District Attorney
has asked me to bring my expertise to bear

72
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,500
on a potentially very difficult case.

73
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,030
I arrived in Phoenix
yesterday, but I've already...

74
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,550
concluded my preliminary
analysis of the police files.

75
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,420
Oh,my God.

76
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,170
Oh,well,this must be important.

77
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,230
I don't know if you've heard, but we've
got a serial killer here in Phoenix.

78
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,850
I may have heard a little
something about that.

79
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,120
What's on your mind,Allison?

80
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,150
Agent Edward Cooper.

81
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,670
I know he's in town working on the case.

82
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,240
I need to know what he's up to.

83
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,830
That's Gretchen Ballard.

84
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,710
She was a hooker,worked
the area around Shadyside.

85
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,320
Seven months ago a garbageman
found her body in an alley.

86
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,040
Somebody'd stabbed her 26 times.

87
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,790
Oh,God.

88
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,820
A buddy of mine caught the case.

89
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,170
He never solved it, but he always
remembered one little detail.

90
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,640
When they found Gretchen Ballard's body,
she was wearing a silver wedding band.

91
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,580
Really? A prostitute
with a wedding band?

92
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,710
That's weird,right?

93
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,380
Well,two days ago, some kids found
the body of another prostitute.

94
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,080
Amanda Boone.

95
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,330
Also stabbed more than
20 times. Also wearing...

96
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,490
a silver wedding band?

97
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,330
Okay,that's weird.

98
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,910
Cooper's in town to help us determine
if the two cases are connected.

99
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,510
He went through all the old
case files, and he found a third,

100
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,640
unsolved murder that's
a potential match.

101
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,660
A little over a year ago, a pro named Nina
Jarvis was stabbed to death in Glendale.

102
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,400
The ME's report said she was
wearing a silver wedding band.

103
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,480
Nobody thought much of it at the time,
but now Cooper wants to take a look.

104
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,000
So where's Cooper now?

105
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,030
Why does that matter so much to you?

106
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,530
If you've seen something that ties to
this case, why don't you just tell me?

107
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,250
I'll make sure word gets to Cooper.

108
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,590
Because I can't.

109
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,590
Cooper's the only person
I can talk to about this.

110
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,770
Now,where is he? Please.

111
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,720
Right about now, Cooper's getting
a little face time with Nina Jarvis,

112
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,290
our potential third victim.

113
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,740
They're exhuming her body to see
if her ring matches the other two.

114
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,520
Now,you didn't hear it from me, but
she's buried at Sycamore Hill Cemetery.

115
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,200
If you drive over there now, I'm sure
you'll find what you're looking for.

116
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,950
Mr. Dubois?

117
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,490
Can I get you anything to drink?

118
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,870
Oh,no,thank you. I'm fine.

119
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,210
It's a good sign, you know.

120
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,790
The fact that they're still talking.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,290
It means your presentation went well.

122
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,920
Miss Doyle.

123
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,210
I'm sorry,Mr. Dubois.

124
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,810
As we mentioned in the meeting, we've already got
a couple of competitive projects in the pipeline.

125
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,390
We're worried about overlap.

126
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,110
It's okay. Really.

127
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,840
Uh,just grateful you were
willing to hear me out.

128
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,620
For what it's worth...

129
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,390
I fought for you.

130
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,000
I happen to think your idea's a lot
smarter than the ones we're backing.

131
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,950
Well,for what it's
worth, I appreciate that.

132
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,460
I just want to reiterate what an honor it
is to be working with you, Agent Cooper.

133
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,470
I've followed your career for many years,
even had the pleasure of reading your books.

134
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,420
I want to assure you that if we do
learn that these murders are connected,

135
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,060
my office is prepared to offer you whatever
resources you may need to catch the perpetrator.

136
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,330
And if it would be at all helpful,

137
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:31,370
I'm happy to liaise with the mayor's office
on your behalf, perhaps even the media.

138
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,540
That's quite a selfless
gesture,Mr. Van Dyke,

139
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,880
offering to stand in front
of all those cameras for me.

140
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,220
It's a match to the other rings.

141
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,380
Looks like you're going to end
up in front of a camera after all.

142
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,110
I'll inform the mayor.

143
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,460
Mrs. Dubois, what a pleasant surprise.

144
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,630
Welcome back to Phoenix, Agent Cooper.

145
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,740
I wish I could say I was
glad to be back in town,

146
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,410
but,unfortunately,you can
see that I'm here on business.

147
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,020
Speaking of which, I can't tell
you how disappointed I was to hear

148
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,100
that you're no longer consulting
for the District Attorney's office.

149
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,790
I'm sure you are.

150
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,060
I mean it.

151
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,890
I know how very good
you are at what you do.

152
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,700
I suspect I know it better than most.

153
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,210
I don't have much time, Agent
Cooper, so if you'll forgive me,

154
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,910
I'll just cut right to the chase.

155
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,050
I know what you're doing here in
Phoenix and I'm here to tell you

156
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,810
I'm not going to let
you get away with it.

157
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,090
You're not going to let me get
away with catching a serial killer?

158
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,890
I'm not going to let you kill him.

159
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,900
I had a dream and I
saw you murder a man.

160
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,990
I'm not sure what you think you saw,

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,260
but the fact of the matter is
I'm not like the men that I hunt.

162
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,240
I don't do what I do out of compulsion.

163
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,220
I do it out of necessity.

164
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,510
I only take action
when the system fails.

165
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,250
But I assure you my intention
is to bring this man to justice,

166
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,210
not deliver my own brand of it.

167
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,740
I know what I saw.

168
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,170
I saw you sneaking
into a man's hotel room.

169
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,410
You had your gun out.

170
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,960
I saw the look on his face
when you were closing in on him.

171
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,740
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,570
Did you just say that
you saw this man's face?

173
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,150
Can you describe him to me?

174
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,050
I know what you're thinking.

175
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:55,640
You don't want to give me a description
of a man you think I'm going to murder.

176
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,050
Prioritize,Mrs. Dubois.

177
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:07,510
Help me protect the citizens
of Phoenix from a serial killer.

178
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,130
Then you can worry about protecting
the serial killer from me.

179
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,760
Agent Cooper?

180
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,950
Is this woman bothering you?

181
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,120
Quite the contrary, Mr. Van Dyke.

182
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,840
Mrs. Dubois and I are just
working out the terms of a deal.

183
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,140
I'm sorry. I don't
understand. What kind of deal?

184
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,490
I'm assuming that your offer to provide me with
whatever resource I might need still stands.

185
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,080
Of course it does.

186
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,980
Good. Because I need her.

187
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,120
I need Allison Dubois.

188
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,130
Boy,have I not missed seeing that
sort of stuff around the house.

189
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,050
Sorry. They're Agent Cooper's.

190
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,540
He wanted me to look over everything he
had, make sure I was ready for tomorrow.

191
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,150
Gotta hand it to that guy.

192
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,450
He must be one hell of a salesman.

193
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,250
Salesman?

194
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,350
I'm just saying that this morning
you couldn't live with the possibility

195
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,910
that he might take another life.

196
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,790
And,tonight,he's your new partner.

197
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,840
He swore to me that he wouldn't
harm the man who killed these women.

198
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,720
You at least got a pinky-swear
to that effect,right?

199
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,130
'Cause,without one, he's really under
no legal obligation to stop killing.

200
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,410
I'm sorry. I shouldn't tease.

201
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,150
Frankly,I'm just glad that someone in
this house is bringing home a paycheck.

202
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,260
Honey,I'm sorry it didn't work
out with those venture capitalists.

203
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:35,400
I guess I could learn a thing or two
about salesmanship from Agent Cooper,huh?

204
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,780
Oh,come on. You know you
gave a good presentation.

205
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,700
They told you it was a good idea.

206
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,780
Yeah? Well,that and a quarter...

207
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:49,470
You know,if you're looking for investors,
maybe you might want to try Bridgette.

208
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,230
Well,she's having quite a
run with the tooth fairy.

209
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,250
A dollar a tooth.

210
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,680
You know,maybe if we feed
her nothing but taffy...

211
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,730
That's not funny.

212
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,970
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,790
Having had some time to familiarize myself with the
forensic evidence gathered from the three victims,

214
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,870
as well as the manner in
which they were killed,

215
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:29,130
I've prepared a very preliminary psychological
profile of the man we're looking for.

216
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,410
His methodology indicates he has
deep-seated issues with women.

217
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,450
He probably compensates for his
inability to deal with the opposite sex

218
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:43,120
by concentrating excessively
on his own appearance.

219
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:48,150
He's not an attractive
man, but he's a vain one.

220
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,640
I wouldn't be surprised if he adheres
to a rigorous exercise regimen.

221
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,490
Very impressive, Agent Cooper.

222
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,990
I'll give you that.

223
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,300
Hair color,eye color, approximate
age,height, and weight.

224
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,780
Given this level of detail, I take it we
now have a witness to one of the murders?

225
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:15,050
Let's just say that Mrs.
Dubois' consulting services

226
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,490
have already proven quite valuable,

227
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,990
and leave it at that.

228
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,950
You stand behind this composite then?

229
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,410
You're willing to stake
your reputation on it?

230
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,950
Why,Mr. District Attorney, I
thought we were in this together.

231
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:35,000
I'll make sure it's distributed then.

232
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,730
I've asked Mrs. Dubois
to work from here today.

233
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,940
Go through your mug books, see
if any faces jump out at her.

234
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,260
She's welcome to any
vacant desk in the bullpen.

235
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,360
- That'll be fine.
- I'm afraid that's not quite good enough.

236
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,640
Mrs. Dubois requires a certain
amount of quiet to do her job.

237
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,480
A certain amount of solitude.

238
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,760
I thought maybe you could put her
up in one of your private offices.

239
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,780
Agent Cooper...

240
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,430
Mr. Van Dyke.

241
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,640
I realize that you and
Mrs. Dubois have a history,

242
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:14,200
but surely you're willing to put that aside
in the interest of catching this killer.

243
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,560
After all...

244
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,450
I'd hate to have the
press get wind of the fact

245
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:24,010
that I was getting anything less
than your complete cooperation.

246
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:32,160
I believe we have an office
available on the second floor.

247
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,310
You're welcome to it.

248
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,060
That wasn't really necessary.

249
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,070
What wasn't?

250
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,400
That. Much as I love
watching that weasel squirm,

251
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,400
I didn't even have my own office
when Devalos was in charge.

252
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,000
Well,maybe he didn't value
your services as much as I do.

253
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,000
Well,while we're on the
subject of my services,

254
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,670
I had another dream about
our killer last night,

255
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,360
and you should know that your
profile was right on the money.

256
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,030
He was watching your press conference

257
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,110
while he adhered to his
"rigorous exercise regimen."

258
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,510
Did you see anything that
might help us locate him?

259
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,280
No,but he didn't look too happy
about having the darkest corners

260
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,150
of his psyche aired on television.

261
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,790
"Unhappy" is good, Mrs. Dubois.

262
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,500
If he's unhappy, he's that
much closer to making a mistake.

263
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,670
Mr. Dubois?

264
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,460
Hello.

265
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,410
I'm glad you found me.

266
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,480
My assistant's not always the
best when it comes to directions.

267
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,050
Please.

268
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:35,940
Well,I'm due back at the office, so
I'm going to get right to the point.

269
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:41,100
I'm here because I want to help you develop
your solar cell amplification system.

270
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,610
And I believe I have
the funding to do it.

271
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,790
Ms. Doyle,Meghan...

272
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,010
I don't know what to say. I
don't know how to thank you.

273
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,080
I don't know what you said to your
colleagues to bring them around,but...

274
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,670
Actually,I didn't say anything.

275
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,550
I'm sure they're just as dead-set against going
into business with you today as they were yesterday.

276
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,940
Then I'm afraid I'm a little confused.

277
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,900
You just said that you had the funding.

278
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,050
If the money's not coming from
Buchanon-Lockhart,then where...

279
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,520
Me,Mr. Dubois.

280
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,190
The money would be coming from me.

281
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,690
Like I told you yesterday,
I believe in your idea.

282
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,040
I think it's a money-maker.

283
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,760
And the truth is, I've been looking for
an opportunity like this for a long time.

284
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,470
I'm tired of making money
for Buchanon-Lockhart.

285
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,310
I want to go into business for myself.

286
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,730
I want to get my hands dirty.

287
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:35,600
I've saved about $300,000 just
waiting to hear the right idea.

288
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,130
And I think I've heard it.

289
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,460
Agent Cooper?

290
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,120
Agent Cooper,it's late.

291
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,800
I was going to head home.

292
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,190
Agent Cooper...

293
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,590
I see you've found my
high-tech security system.

294
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,930
I do it everywhere I go.

295
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,000
It's just something I use to make sure

296
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,950
that nobody's been in
my office while I'm gone.

297
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,590
It's a bit paranoid, I know.

298
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,170
But I'm afraid I just can't help myself.

299
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,910
Well,I went through
these files twice,sir.

300
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,700
Our killer's not in here.

301
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,550
I'm sorry.

302
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,900
Oh,no need for apologies.

303
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,070
Well,I just wish we were further along.

304
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,440
"Further along?"

305
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,250
Mrs. Dubois, because of you,

306
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,560
I have what could very well turn out to
be a physical description of the killer.

307
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,290
You've also given me reason to believe
that my profile of the man is accurate.

308
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,000
I think it's fair to say that because
of your involvement in this case,

309
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,350
I'm potentially weeks ahead
of where I'd normally be.

310
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,950
Well,thank you,sir.

311
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,790
I have to say it's been a long time since
anyone's taken my dreams so seriously,

312
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,320
especially here in the
District Attorney's office.

313
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,100
Well, shame on them for
ignoring your talents.

314
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,940
I would never be so obtuse.

315
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,410
I know what I have in you.

316
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,940
Good night,sir.

317
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,730
Good night.

318
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,620
Housekeeping. Do you
want turndown service?

319
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,090
Hello.

320
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,230
Allison,it's Lee Scanlon.

321
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,600
I'm sorry to wake you, but I knew
you'd want to hear this right away.

322
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,620
It's about Agent Cooper.

323
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,470
He was shot. Twice.

324
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,430
Oh,my God,no.

325
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,260
*********

326
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,870
Whoever killed Cooper didn't
leave much evidence behind.

327
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,570
Swept his hotel for fingerprints--
anything that might have DNA on it.

328
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,460
So far nothing.

329
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,110
Service weapon's missing,too.

330
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,860
We think the killer might have
taken it with him as a trophy.

331
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,060
I had it all wrong.

332
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,270
I thought I saw Cooper
hunting the killer.

333
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,300
The killer was really hunting him.

334
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,270
I hate to be the bearer of
even more bad news, but,uh...

335
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,620
Van Dyke wants to see you in his office.

336
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,840
Asked if you'd come
there as soon as you can.

337
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,990
I'm so sorry.

338
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,490
What did I tell you about apologies?

339
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,220
They're not necessary.

340
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,300
I wish I'd done more for you.

341
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,670
Mrs. Dubois,I only have
so many pep talks in me.

342
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,370
I've told you I'm happy with your work.

343
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,290
Now if it's all right with you,
I'd like to get down to business.

344
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:53,010
I'm going to be interviewing the
acquaintances of the most recent victim today,

345
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,230
and I'd like you to come with me.

346
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,210
Oh,sir...

347
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,750
I'm not sure you understand
what happened to you last night.

348
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,200
Well,actually,last night is a bit fuzzy.

349
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,320
Do you remember going home?

350
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,590
Going to your hotel room?

351
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,700
That man that you were looking for...

352
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,980
he was waiting there for you.

353
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,240
And he shot you twice.

354
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:31,080
And you... didn't survive.

355
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,700
This... this just can't be.

356
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,080
I don't know what you
think you're doing in here,

357
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,330
but those files are
no longer your concern.

358
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,620
And in light of Edward
Cooper's tragic death,

359
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,320
the Phoenix District Attorney's office
no longer has any need for your...

360
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,580
services. They're terminated,
effective immediately.

361
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,070
I need you out of the
building, Mrs. Dubois.

362
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,820
It's 11:00. What do you say?

363
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,410
I'm not ready yet.

364
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,030
The guy was a killer,Allison.

365
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,630
You couldn't tell me enough.

366
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,830
The guy was a killer.

367
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,320
That doesn't mean he
deserved what he got.

368
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,050
I got those papers
from Meghan Doyle today.

369
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,950
Turns out she has a rather flexible
definition of the word "partnership."

370
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,910
What do you mean?

371
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:48,320
On exchange for funding,
she wants 51% ownership.

372
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,360
I'm told that's a
non-negotiable figure.

373
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,210
I don't get it. That
only leaves you 49%.

374
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,080
Exactly. Minority share.

375
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,640
She's trying to buy
the right to be my boss.

376
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,210
Tell her no.

377
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,040
Yeah,it definitely crossed my mind.

378
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,510
I was also thinking
maybe I'd tell her yes.

379
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,930
I want to get on with it,honey.
I want to get on with my life.

380
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,910
I want to earn a living. I
want to accomplish something.

381
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,480
Do you want to give up
control of your idea?

382
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,780
No,of course I don't.

383
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,530
Then don't.

384
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,350
If Meghan Doyle thinks your idea
is great, somebody else will,too.

385
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,200
Somebody who's willing
to do it your way.

386
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,700
Okay.

387
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,270
Is that an official psychic prediction?

388
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,860
That's an official wife who
believes in her husband prediction.

389
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,800
What do you say?

390
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,300
It's past 11:00.

391
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,160
I'm just saying I thought the ending
was spectacularly stupid,that's all.

392
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,820
Fine,you don't like
romantic comedies. I get it.

393
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,420
I didn't say that.

394
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,210
The next time we go to the movies,
we'll see something about zombies.

395
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,750
Or ninjas.

396
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,500
Or ninjas fighting zombies.

397
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,430
You promise?

398
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,950
What's going on? You okay?

399
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,420
Yeah,I'm sorry. It was a bad dream.

400
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,570
More serial killer stuff?

401
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,170
No. It was a car accident.

402
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,990
- You need to call someone?
- No.

403
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,030
I don't know who they were.

404
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,660
I don't know where they were.

405
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,510
It's okay. Go back to sleep.

406
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,230
I'm going to get a glass of water.

407
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,650
COOPER: You have a
lovely home, Mrs. Dubois.

408
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,030
It's very you.

409
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:55,430
I wanted to apologize for
disappearing this morning.

410
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,500
I didn't quite have a
handle on my situation yet.

411
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:03,140
You know,if there's anything
you need me to do, maybe...

412
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,700
give a message to your loved ones.

413
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,120
Mrs. Dubois...

414
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:12,430
Are you forgetting that we
still have a killer to catch?

415
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:19,640
My own murder was unfortunate,yes, but it
hardly changes the nature of our collaboration.

416
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,620
Are you saying you're
here because of the case?

417
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,220
Why else would I be here?

418
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,010
My last moments were
extremely unpleasant.

419
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,330
Not because of the
considerable pain I was in,

420
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:38,180
but because,as far as I knew, I
wasn't going to close this case.

421
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,670
My killer reveled in that fact.

422
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,520
He stood over me as I
lay dying, taunting me.

423
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:52,020
He insisted that Gretchen Ballard and Amanda
Boone and Nina Jarvis were only the beginning;

424
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:58,430
that with with me out of the picture, no
one could stop him from taking more lives.

425
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,720
But with your help...

426
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,370
I'd like to show him
just how wrong he was.

427
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,700
Okay.

428
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,500
What would you like me to do?

429
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,300
To start with...

430
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,730
first thing this morning I want
you to go back to the police

431
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,260
and give them a description
of the man who killed me.

432
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,950
Okay. But I already did that.

433
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,050
You were there when we made the sketch.

434
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,360
Yes,I know. You told him
that he was a compact man...

435
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,970
long hair,hazel eyes, extremely fit.

436
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,210
And he was.

437
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,860
Well,no,actually,he wasn't.

438
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,690
The man who killed me
was short,middle-aged,

439
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,840
shaved head, bit on the pudgy side.

440
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,210
Frankly,I'm...

441
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,480
I'm a little embarrassed
that he got the drop on me.

442
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,910
I don't know whose face you've been
seeing in your dreams,Mrs. Dubois,

443
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:58,730
but he's not the killer
that we've been looking for.

444
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,810
******

445
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,590
I'm glad I caught you.

446
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,930
I need to talk to you about Cooper.

447
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,480
That's funny. I was just about to
call you about the very same subject.

448
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:16,040
A valet at the hotel where Cooper was staying
just got a look of your sketch of the killer.

449
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,000
He saw a guy who looked just like him peeling out of
the hotel parking lot the night Cooper was murdered.

450
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,110
Valet remembers the make
and model of the car,

451
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,820
and get this, he even got a
partial on the guy's license plate

452
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,930
because he thought the guy
might have been driving drunk.

453
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,190
Seems like a pretty good lead,right?

454
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,610
I was just about to go run it down.

455
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,060
Don't bother. The sketch is wrong.

456
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,140
What are you talking about?
The sketch came from you.

457
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,600
I don't know what to tell you.

458
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,720
Apparently,I got the wrong face.

459
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,630
Uh,and you know that because?

460
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,420
I know that because Cooper
came to see me last night.

461
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,020
And he saw the man who shot him and
it wasn't the person I described.

462
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,800
Okay,what do you want from me then?

463
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:52,250
A favor. I need to look
through the mug books again.

464
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,980
Why? You just got done telling me
you didn't see the killer's face.

465
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:58,890
Well,that's true I
didn't, but Cooper did.

466
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,350
Lynn,hey.

467
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,770
Sorry,it doesn't look like
lunch is in the cards today.

468
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,620
What am I doing?

469
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:24,690
You wouldn't believe it,
not in a million years.

470
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,810
His name is Donald Kessler.

471
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,650
Convicted of rape in '97.

472
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,120
Served ten years and
got out last spring.

473
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,930
Cooper's positive this is our guy?

474
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,750
He said there's no doubt about it.

475
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:48,340
Well,according to this, our friend Mr. Kessler
skipped out on his parole about six months ago.

476
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,060
Present whereabouts unknown.

477
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,880
It says here he's got
a sister in Glendale.

478
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:56,280
Maybe you could go talk to her and
see if she's heard from him lately.

479
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,140
Talk to people? Yeah,sure,I can do that.

480
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,700
Ask some questions--
not a problem.

481
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,700
Who knows,I might even
be able to find the guy.

482
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,830
Just try to remember, it's going to
take a whole lot more than the word of

483
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,300
a dead FBI guy for me
to actually arrest him.

484
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,850
Hey,partner.

485
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,480
Come on. Sit down. We have
some celebrating to do.

486
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,800
No,Meghan, I don't want a drink.

487
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,730
I'm not sure that I should even sit.

488
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,500
I just,I figured you deserved
to hear this in person.

489
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,370
Okay...

490
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,740
You found someone else, another firm,
somebody you think is better connected.

491
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,190
Willing to offer more capital?

492
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,560
No,no,it's not that.

493
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,410
For God's sake,sit down.

494
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,100
People are looking.

495
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,000
They think we're
lovers having a quarrel.

496
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,420
I'm sorry.

497
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,350
Meghan,uh...

498
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:55,430
I'm extremely flattered by
your interest in my proposal.

499
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,460
Um,I just... I didn't realize that you
were going to buy a controlling stake.

500
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,930
That's just not something
that I'm willing to give up.

501
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,160
I'm sorry.

502
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:10,360
But unless you're willing to rethink the 51-49
split, I don't see how I can do this with you.

503
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,630
Can I have a dirty martini?

504
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,930
Joe?

505
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:26,470
Gosh,you're going to turn me
downand make me drink alone?

506
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,550
Okay,fine. I'll have what she's having.

507
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,650
Someone win the lottery?

508
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,120
Ah,not quite.

509
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:41,970
One of Bridgette's teeth finally fell
out, so the Tooth Fairy owes her a dollar.

510
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,660
And all I've got is a ten, a five and...

511
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,170
89 cents.

512
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,630
I got wrinkled and non-wrinkled.

513
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,500
Martini,huh?

514
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,060
So how'd it go? How'd she take it?

515
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,760
Um,I signed the papers.

516
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,990
You're upset.

517
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:12,220
No,I'm not upset. I'm bewildered.

518
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,190
You told me you were
gonna turn her down.

519
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,040
I know,I know. And I,and I absolutely,
I should have talked to you first.

520
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:22,290
I just... she really wants it.

521
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,350
I don't know. When she started to tell
me about her plans for the business,

522
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,930
what she thought the upside would
be in three years and five years,

523
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,110
and I just can't explain it.

524
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,590
I just started to get a
really good feeling about her.

525
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,500
I guess you'd call it an intuition.

526
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,920
I mean, if anybody can understand going
with their intuition, it's you,right?

527
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,290
So what happened to "Let's be patient"?

528
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,640
What happened to being your own boss?

529
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,750
I don't know. Maybe I was
being a little naive about that.

530
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,540
According to her, there's no way that I
have the leverage to get a majority share

531
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,490
no matter who I sign with.

532
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:57,580
Probably wouldn't even
get close to 49% either.

533
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:02,300
Now,look,Al,I know this is out of
the blue, but tell me you're happy.

534
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:05,910
This is gonna be so much
better if you're happy with it.

535
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,110
I'm happy... as long as you are.

536
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,320
I am.

537
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,610
Well,then that's that.

538
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,570
We are officially happy.

539
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,880
Julia?

540
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,100
Julia? Baby?

541
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,150
You okay?

542
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,260
What just happened?

543
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,160
We were in a crash.

544
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,890
Somebody just hit us.

545
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,070
Stay here,okay?

546
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,340
I'm gonna go check on the other driver.

547
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,530
Hey,buddy? You okay?

548
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,010
Mrs. Dubois?

549
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,150
I found him, Mrs. Dubois.
I know where he is.

550
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,350
Where who is?

551
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,640
Donald Kessler, the man who murdered me.

552
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:14,940
He's at a
bar downtown--

553
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,430
the Old Stone Jug, 1818 Hamilton Street.

554
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,930
If you and Detective Scanlon go down
there right now, you'll find him.

555
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,300
You'll find evidence on him that
proves he murdered those women.

556
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,760
Move,Mrs. Dubois! We
haven't a moment to spare!

557
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,550
Wait a second. He said
it was the Old Stone Jug.

558
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,580
You sure it was this Old Stone Jug?

559
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,420
Well,1818 Hamilton Street.

560
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,450
This is absolutely the place.

561
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,090
Well,I don't know what
to tell you,Allison.

562
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,150
According to this,the place
got condemned back in '05.

563
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,090
No one's had a drink
here in a good long time.

564
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,110
Well,he couldn't have been clearer.

565
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,760
He said Donald Kessler
was here right now.

566
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,020
Honestly,I'm a little confused myself.

567
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,280
I know I never understood
exactly how your thing works,

568
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,700
but you always made it
sound like after you die,

569
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,620
you pretty much know everything
there is, was or ever will be.

570
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:06,120
So tell me, how does a dead guy,
especially one as smart as Edward Cooper,

571
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,040
make a mistake like this?

572
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,410
Oh,boy,this doesn't look good.

573
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,140
Wait. Pull over.

574
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,620
It's being handled.

575
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,850
I dreamt about this. Please pull over.

576
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,230
You wait here. I'll go get the scoop.

577
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,870
Looks a lot like the guy
in your sketch,doesn't he?

578
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,320
This is him. This is the
man I saw kill Cooper.

579
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,310
As much as I hate to disagree with
the ghost of a famous profiler,

580
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,420
that is the man who
killed Edward Cooper.

581
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,170
The name is Julian Pierce.

582
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:24,950
First cops on the scene found a duffel bag
on the seat of his car that had a gun inside.

583
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,060
They ran the serial numbers.

584
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,960
Turns out it was a
government-issued firearm:

585
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,970
Edward Cooper's
government-issued firearm.

586
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,410
What about Donald Kessler?

587
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,580
Donald Kessler didn't kill Cooper.

588
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,850
He didn't kill those three
prostitutes either. Julian Pierce did.

589
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,810
In addition to Cooper's gun,
they found a stash of photos.

590
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,380
Polaroids of
the dead women--

591
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:46,760
even a few close-ups of the wedding
bands he put on their fingers.

592
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:51,820
I don't know why Cooper claimed that Donald
Kessler killed them, but he was wrong.

593
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:59,600
Oh,no. No,he wasn't wrong.

594
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,570
He was lying to us.

595
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,420
He knew this was gonna happen.

596
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:07,720
That's why he tried to throw
us off of Julian Pierce's scent.

597
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:12,610
He knew if we arrested Pierce, before
tonight, he wouldn't have been in this car.

598
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,590
He wouldn't have died in this accident.

599
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,190
So you're saying this was a setup?

600
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,140
That Cooper sent you on a wild goose chase
to guarantee that this guy died tonight?

601
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,690
'Cause I have to tell you, Allison,
that sounds a lot like murder.

602
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,530
Not to Cooper.

603
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:34,330
To Edward Cooper, this was justice.

604
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,280
You should know, Mrs. Dubois.

605
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:51,340
The one thing I regret in
all this was lying to you.

606
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:54,980
Well,I can see that.
Look,you're all torn up inside.

607
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:59,060
I never intended for you to
come across that accident site.

608
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:04,190
And I certainly didn't want the death of
Julian Pierce weighing on your conscience.

609
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:10,980
I know how strongly you prefer working
within the confines of the justice system.

610
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:15,770
For what it's worth, I wasn't lying when
you first came to me at the cemetery.

611
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,910
I had absolutely no intention
of taking Julian Pierce's life.

612
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:26,140
But as you well know,
circumstances changed.

613
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,080
My death gave me a whole new...

614
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,750
perspective on the man and his actions.

615
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,800
New perspective.

616
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:36,140
I think you're underestimating
how well I know you, Agent Cooper.

617
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,980
This was revenge, pure and simple.

618
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:45,280
I won't deny I took a certain amount
of pleasure in Mr. Pierce's death.

619
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:51,400
But I assure you, what I did
tonight, I did for the greater good.

620
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,830
Tell yourself whatever you want.

621
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,510
I'm going to bed.

622
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,090
Ellen Hartley.

623
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,550
I beg your pardon?

624
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,450
Ellen Hartley.

625
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,590
She's a nurse at McCarren
State Penitentiary.

626
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:09,180
It's where Mr. Pierce would have ended up
had you and Detective Scanlon arrested him.

627
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,180
You'd like her,Mrs. Dubois.

628
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,950
She's a mother of three just like you.

629
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,080
In four years' time, Julian
Pierce was going to fake an illness

630
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:20,700
so he could spend the night
in the prison infirmary.

631
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:24,680
He was going to strangle Ellen Hartley.

632
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:30,580
I suppose he wanted just one more notch
on his belt before they executed him.

633
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,950
I don't believe you.

634
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,420
You're lying to me again.

635
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:36,450
It's all you've ever done.

636
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:41,530
If there was some way I
could prove it to you,I would.

637
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:45,280
But the fact of the matter
is you'll never know.

638
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,130
You'll never be certain

639
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:52,280
I did the right thing by facilitating
the death of Julian Pierce.

640
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:53,930
But I am.

641
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,080
I am absolutely positive

642
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:01,490
the world is a much better
place without him in it.

643
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,910
Why don't you just go away?

644
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,710
I'm not ready to move on just yet.

645
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,180
It occurs to me, Mrs. Dubois, that you
and I have a very unique opportunity.

646
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,890
This doesn't have to be
our last collaboration.

647
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,810
What are you talking about?

648
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,430
I can see a lot of
things from this side,

649
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,680
things I can't share
with anyone but you.

650
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:31,380
If I were to catch on
to another Julian Pierce,

651
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:36,120
you'd be in a unique position
to help me take care of it.

652
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,570
You want me to help you end more lives?

653
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,040
I want you to help me save lives:

654
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:46,020
potential victims,good people
who don't deserve to die.

655
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,070
It's so sad.

656
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,160
I'm sure at some point
you were a good man.

657
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:55,880
I don't know where you lost your way, but in
the end,you are no better than Julian Pierce.

658
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,100
You're a killer.

659
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:02,360
And before long, you're gonna wind
up in the same terrible place he is.

660
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,360
I would never help you.

661
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,850
Guess we won't know until we know.

662
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,030
Will we?

663
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,670
It's been a pleasure, Mrs. Dubois.

664
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,340
As always.
