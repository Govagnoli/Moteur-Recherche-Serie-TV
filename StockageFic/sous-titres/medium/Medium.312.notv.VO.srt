evalos.

4
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:31,072
District Attorney Devalos.

5
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,098
No, no. I know he's not at work
yet, that's why I'm calling you.

6
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:35,277
That's why I'm asking
for his home number.

7
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,543
No, please don't
put me on...

8
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,397
hold.
Hey!

9
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:41,500
There's only four Heart-a-Bear
cards in here.

10
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,234
Daddy!
Hold on, Bridge.

11
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:45,606
Uh, nature of my business?

12
00:04:45,606 --> 00:04:47,320
My wife works for him.
She works in that office.

13
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:49,964
I really need to speak with him.

14
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:52,623
Yes, of course, I'll hold again.

15
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,730
Where is my hair scrunchie

16
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:57,209
and where's Mommy?

17
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,152
Uh, Mom--

18
00:04:59,661 --> 00:05:01,384
Mom had to go in
to work early today.

19
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:04,641
Yeah, no, I know it's
an unlisted number.

20
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:07,103
That's... I have it
here somewhere,

21
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:07,890
I just can't find it.

22
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,860
Daddy, is something going on?

23
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,727
You're acting like
something's going on.

24
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:13,500
Huh? No, sweetie,
everything's fine.

25
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,638
Nothing's going on. Daddy's just
looking for a number.

26
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:17,923
Uh, help your sister
with her, uh...

27
00:05:17,923 --> 00:05:19,489
stuff. I'll be
right with you.

28
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:22,235
Why are yodoing
this in the kitchen?

29
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:24,548
You're going to get food
all over everything.

30
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:25,912
I have to get finished.

31
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:27,936
I have seven boyfriends
this year.

32
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:30,772
And that's a lot of cards.
Valentine's Day

33
00:05:30,772 --> 00:05:32,189
is a manufactured
holiday invented

34
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:33,737
by greeting card companies

35
00:05:33,737 --> 00:05:34,947
to trick dumb
third graders

36
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:37,222
into buying Heart-a-Bear cards.

37
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,716
That's a lie!

38
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:40,349
Bridge, hold on. I can't hear.

39
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:43,565
Yeah. Yes, it's an emergency,

40
00:05:43,565 --> 00:05:46,129
but it's not a 911 emergency,
it's personal.

41
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:47,880
Valentine's Day is real.

42
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:50,832
Send a card to your friends
who are boys,

43
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:52,856
and if you get one back

44
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,039
they're your true love.

45
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,106
Really? Your true love?

46
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,381
Because he gives you a card?

47
00:05:58,756 --> 00:06:00,116
I don't think so.
You know what?

48
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:02,327
Forget it. I found it.
Valentine's Day

49
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:04,578
is for real.
Isn't it, Daddy?

50
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:06,053
Yeah, Bridge. Of course, Bridge.

51
00:06:34,315 --> 00:06:36,014
Yeah, I got a call
from the D.A., told me you had

52
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:37,642
a bit of a situation,
asked me to come by.

53
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:39,601
Yeah, I appreciate
it, Detective.

54
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:40,841
It's a little
crazy around here.

55
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:41,695
Let's go on the patio.

56
00:06:42,554 --> 00:06:43,518
Hi, Detective Scanlon.

57
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:45,203
Is my mom with you?

58
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:47,977
No, honey, I'm
actually here to
see your Daddy.

59
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:50,735
Daddy, is everything okay?
Everything's fine, pumpkin.

60
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:52,394
Just look after your sister
for me for a second.

61
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:56,695
We got an APB out
on your car, we got
the phone company

62
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:58,857
monitoring your cell in case
she uses it to call somebody.

63
00:06:58,857 --> 00:07:00,461
At this point, it's really
just a matter of time.

64
00:07:01,683 --> 00:07:02,447
Okay.

65
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:05,236
I gotta get the kids
to school, and act...

66
00:07:05,236 --> 00:07:06,871
act like nothing's happened.

67
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:09,790
Uh, if you find her,
call me on Allison's cell?

68
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,332
I'm gonna take that with me.
Sure.

69
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,337
She was perfectly lucid, just...

70
00:07:17,164 --> 00:07:18,255
someone else.

71
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:23,044
Look, get your kids to school.

72
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:25,215
The second we locate her,
I'll call you.
All right.

73
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:26,624
Tom?

74
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,012
Tom?

75
00:07:33,673 --> 00:07:34,245
Dora?

76
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,298
Es usted, SeÒora O'Bannon?

77
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:38,931
Uh, yeah-- um...

78
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:42,155
How the hell do you say,
"in the kitchen?"

79
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,236
Uh...

80
00:07:43,742 --> 00:07:45,949
En lacocina, Dora!

81
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:48,380
(speaking Spanish)

82
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,273
(speaking Spanish)

83
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:53,610
Slow down, Dora.

84
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,467
I'm still learning here.
It's Spanish 101.

85
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:58,435
What is it?
(speaking Spanish)

86
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:05,563
Dora.

87
00:08:05,563 --> 00:08:06,690
What is it? What's happened?

88
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:09,537
Policia, emergency.

89
00:08:09,537 --> 00:08:12,717
2323 Glendale Lane.

90
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:17,593
Okay.

91
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:19,558
Out, you two.

92
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:21,743
Love you.

93
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,549
Bye, Dad.

94
00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:24,920
Bye.
Love you, Dad.

95
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,176
Hello?

96
00:08:35,886 --> 00:08:37,096
Told you it wouldn't take long.

97
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:44,147
Two patrols responded to
a B&E on Glendale Lane.

98
00:08:44,783 --> 00:08:46,122
ID'd your car
in the driveway.

99
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,997
She was breaking and entering?

100
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:50,456
The maid found her in
the Missus' clothes

101
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:51,637
eating ice cream
in the kitchen.

102
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,191
What?
She was so convincing,

103
00:08:54,191 --> 00:08:56,996
the cops didn't know
who to arrest at first,
Allison or the maid.

104
00:08:58,227 --> 00:08:59,342
The maid could
produce ID.

105
00:09:02,312 --> 00:09:04,582
This woman, the one who's
clothes that she's wearing,

106
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:06,383
she wouldn't happen to have
died recently, would she?

107
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:07,562
First thing I checked.

108
00:09:08,826 --> 00:09:09,789
Very much alive.

109
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,231
Can I talk to her?
Yeah.

110
00:09:17,555 --> 00:09:17,924
Have you

111
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:18,984
called my husband yet?

112
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:20,149
I sure did.

113
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:22,848
You again!

114
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:26,118
Officer, this is the man I was
telling you people about.

115
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:28,795
He got me drunk. I don't know,
maybe even drugged me.

116
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:30,912
Brought me back to his house,
then wouldn't let me leave.

117
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:33,249
He has my purse,
my phone,

118
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:35,532
my ID. Honestly.

119
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:38,217
I don't know who to press
charges against first,

120
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:40,308
him or that crazy housekeeper.

121
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:42,074
Of course I can
always fire

122
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:42,886
her ass.

123
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:45,624
Unfortunately, degenerate
Mr. Mom over here

124
00:09:45,624 --> 00:09:46,844
doesn't work for me.

125
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,600
Stop it.

126
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,271
Excuse me, do you know
who you're speaking to?

127
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:51,158
Enough!

128
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,665
You can't do that.
You can't be that way.

129
00:09:56,275 --> 00:09:57,687
Not while you look like that.

130
00:09:57,687 --> 00:09:59,050
Not while you're...

131
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:01,500
wearing my wife.

132
00:10:02,591 --> 00:10:05,006
He's a whack job.
You can see that,

133
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:06,248
right?
I said enough!

134
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,359
You talk like a piece of trash.

135
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,798
You act like a spoiled brat.

136
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:16,278
You are a repugnant human being

137
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:19,401
and I need you to go back
to wherever you came from

138
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:21,566
and give me back my wife.

139
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:24,130
I demand you remove
this man.

140
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,356
I demand that you wake up!

141
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:27,261
You wake up!

142
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:28,209
You're crazy!

143
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:29,206
He's crazy.

144
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:31,723
Isn't this the part
where the doctors...

145
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:34,130
or Ashton Kutcher,
or someone comes in and...

146
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,005
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

147
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:39,111
Your name is
Allison Dubois.

148
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:41,458
You are a wife.

149
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:42,933
A mother.

150
00:10:43,503 --> 00:10:44,675
You have three children.

151
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:48,378
Sometimes you see
dead people.

152
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:50,874
Any of this
sound familiar?

153
00:10:51,771 --> 00:10:53,438
You are prone
to psychic episodes.

154
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:56,532
I think this may
be one of them.

155
00:10:57,513 --> 00:10:59,068
And we have
to get it to end.

156
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:00,223
Somehow...

157
00:11:01,574 --> 00:11:02,723
you have to make
it to end.

158
00:11:09,384 --> 00:11:11,174
If you could just call
my husband, Tom.

159
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:12,162
I am your husband.

160
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:14,621
I'm your husband.

161
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,005
Me.

162
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:25,496
Why don't you step outside
and give me a minute with her.

163
00:11:27,255 --> 00:11:27,963
Okay.

164
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:41,482
That man is certifiable.

165
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:45,112
That man is a husband
worried about his wife.

166
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:46,764
He may be someone's husband.

167
00:11:46,764 --> 00:11:47,927
He's certainly not mine.

168
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,127
Okay.

169
00:11:54,388 --> 00:11:56,023
You're Sandra O'Bannon.

170
00:11:57,446 --> 00:11:58,777
You're not married,
are you, Detective?

171
00:11:59,491 --> 00:12:01,184
No, Ma'am.
I didn't think so.

172
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:03,051
'Cause you are not
yet exasperating.

173
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:04,490
You still listen.

174
00:12:05,286 --> 00:12:06,503
I'm all ears now, Sandra.

175
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:08,963
Tell me about yourself.

176
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:11,686
My husband is
Dr. Thomas O'Bannon.

177
00:12:11,686 --> 00:12:14,345
We live at 2323
Glendale Lane.

178
00:12:14,345 --> 00:12:15,909
I can give you all
my contact numbers.

179
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,155
In a minute.

180
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:22,001
Tell me about the last thing
you remember.

181
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,038
Tell me about last night.

182
00:12:23,753 --> 00:12:25,003
Everything that happened

183
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:26,142
before you woke up
this morning.

184
00:12:26,936 --> 00:12:28,021
I don't know...
I went out.

185
00:12:28,021 --> 00:12:29,275
Out where?

186
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:32,135
The Spotted Pony.

187
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:33,539
The bar on Mesa?

188
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:35,458
Were you drinking,
Sandra?

189
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,788
No, I was turning tricks.

190
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,549
Of course I was drinking.

191
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,480
I was at a bar.

192
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:41,498
Heavily?

193
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:45,553
Look...

194
00:12:48,675 --> 00:12:51,591
Yesterday I found out that my
husband was having an affair.

195
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:58,022
One minute we're planning
a getaway for Valentine's Day...

196
00:12:58,022 --> 00:13:01,067
the next I discover that he
is sleeping with someone else.

197
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:02,409
Yes. Heavily.

198
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:05,100
The answer to the question
is "heavily."

199
00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:09,797
Do you actually remember
going home with Mr. Dubois?

200
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:13,015
I have done a lot of
incredibly stupid things

201
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:13,883
in my marriage,

202
00:13:13,883 --> 00:13:15,783
issued a lot of really
wicked threats,

203
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:18,315
but I have never cheated
on my husband.

204
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:19,024
Never.

205
00:13:24,795 --> 00:13:26,398
Would you do something
for me, Sandra?

206
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:32,318
If you stop saying my name

207
00:13:32,318 --> 00:13:34,437
like you're humoring
a small child.

208
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:38,046
Go over there.

209
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,180
Tell me what you see when
you look in the mirror.

210
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:43,043
Humor me.

211
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:57,415
What do you want to know?

212
00:13:58,285 --> 00:13:59,074
Describe yourself.

213
00:14:00,694 --> 00:14:02,668
Okay, I'm five eight.

214
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:05,091
Stylish looking.

215
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:07,322
Interesting looking.

216
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:10,264
Pretty, sometimes.

217
00:14:10,264 --> 00:14:12,080
Maybe not today.

218
00:14:14,832 --> 00:14:17,980
I have my father's eyes...
brown.

219
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,828
My mother's nose, thin.

220
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:25,235
Boobs courtesy of my husband.

221
00:14:28,927 --> 00:14:31,106
My hair is a mess.

222
00:14:31,106 --> 00:14:32,614
But Geoffrey can fix that,

223
00:14:32,614 --> 00:14:34,794
if I can convince him
to fit me in this week.

224
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:35,907
Uh, sorry,

225
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:37,111
what color did you say
it was again?

226
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,072
Why, you like it?

227
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:42,995
My hairdresser calls it
Burnt Auburn.

228
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:45,859
This is not from a bottle.

229
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,799
?

230
00:14:53,658 --> 00:14:55,199
The house Allison
broke into this morning

231
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,585
is owned by
a Dr. Thomas O'Bannon

232
00:14:57,585 --> 00:14:58,490
and his wife Sandra.

233
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,750
He's a surgeon.

234
00:15:00,353 --> 00:15:01,441
She's wealthy in
her own right.

235
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:02,595
Richer than God,
actually.

236
00:15:02,595 --> 00:15:03,871
Inherited a fortune
from her Daddy.

237
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,255
Married six years.

238
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:06,171
That's all she wrote.

239
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,283
Have we been able
to reach them?

240
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,381
Talked to the husband's
office this morning,

241
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:11,882
they say he's on
vacation next week.

242
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:13,329
Apparently they have
a house outside of Prescott.

243
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:16,053
No phones, no cell reception.

244
00:15:17,631 --> 00:15:20,930
Well, once we do
get a hold of them,

245
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:22,914
I'm sure I can
make these breaking

246
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:24,161
and entering
charges go away.

247
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:26,094
The problem is, until
we get a hold of them

248
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:27,393
I can't just let
her walk free.

249
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:30,053
Wait a second, you mean,
she's gotta stay in jail

250
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:32,652
until...
Actually I had
another thought.

251
00:15:32,652 --> 00:15:35,602
What, no, no, no, that...
This can't be happening.

252
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:36,434
Listen to me.

253
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,530
I can't imagine that

254
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,435
in her present state you're
anxious to have her at home.

255
00:15:40,435 --> 00:15:42,241
I don't think she'd go
willingly anyway...

256
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:45,079
and it's probably
not smart or safe

257
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:46,235
to have her around
the children.

258
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:48,283
And frankly, legally,
we have no choice.

259
00:15:48,283 --> 00:15:49,535
She committed a crime.

260
00:15:52,142 --> 00:15:53,083
I'm gonna pull some strings

261
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,022
and have her remanded
to a state mental facility.

262
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:56,073
Are you serious?

263
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:57,556
I know she'll be far
more comfortable

264
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,175
and she'll be treated
far more humanely

265
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:00,283
than if she were in jail.

266
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:01,758
The second she's
feeling better...

267
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:03,488
the second she knows
she's Allison Dubois.

268
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,917
I'll go before a judge
and get her out of there.

269
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:06,801
I don't know.

270
00:16:07,462 --> 00:16:09,166
It's not like we really
have any choice, Joe.

271
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:14,491
All right then, Mr. Dubois.

272
00:16:14,491 --> 00:16:15,782
Why don't you say your good-byes

273
00:16:15,782 --> 00:16:17,563
and we'll get
Mrs. Dubois settled in.

274
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:19,598
She prefers to be called
Mrs. O'Bannon.

275
00:16:19,598 --> 00:16:21,158
It is my name,
after all.

276
00:16:21,841 --> 00:16:22,859
I'll make a note of it.

277
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:25,973
I'm really hoping

278
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:27,655
this is only gonna last
for a day or two.

279
00:16:28,274 --> 00:16:29,402
Everyone assured me

280
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:30,926
that the second you're back
to your old self...

281
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:31,729
Listen to me.

282
00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:33,672
I don't know who you are

283
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:35,999
or how you got all these people

284
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:37,498
to believe your crazy story.

285
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:39,625
You can't hold me
prisoner forever.

286
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,916
My husband will find me.

287
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,183
He will get me out.

288
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:44,018
And when he does,
I will see to it

289
00:16:44,018 --> 00:16:47,183
that you pay for everything
that you've done.

290
00:16:48,414 --> 00:16:49,264
All of you.

291
00:17:10,718 --> 00:17:11,788
Hey, Dad.

292
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:12,528
Where's Mom?

293
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:14,080
What's going on?

294
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:17,811
How come
you're picking us up?

295
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:19,938
It's nice to see you, too.

296
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:22,250
You're not walking today?

297
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,490
I wanted to talk to mom
about something.

298
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,572
Is she still at work?

299
00:17:25,572 --> 00:17:28,448
Well, actually mom had to go
on a little trip for work.

300
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:30,446
But she didn't
even say good-bye!

301
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:32,867
Yeah, I know and she feels
really badly about that.

302
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:34,473
You all buckled up?

303
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:36,029
Mm-hmm.
So, can I call her?

304
00:17:36,585 --> 00:17:37,883
Actually she's flying.

305
00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:39,560
She's in the air
right now and...

306
00:17:40,556 --> 00:17:42,828
and she's not gonna land
until late tonight.

307
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,488
And then she's in
a different time zone

308
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:45,958
so it's gonna be tricky.

309
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:48,830
So it's just gonna be us
for a couple of days.

310
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,689
And I'm gonna need
your help, okay?

311
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:52,167
Sure, Dad.
Okay.

312
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:57,255
I just wanted to make sure

313
00:17:57,255 --> 00:17:59,166
that she was settled in
for the night.

314
00:18:01,104 --> 00:18:02,947
Okay... good.

315
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:07,058
Um, what time would you suggest
that I call in the morning?

316
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:10,008
Okay.

317
00:18:10,217 --> 00:18:10,930
Thank you, nurse.

318
00:18:23,231 --> 00:18:23,953
Yeah, hello.

319
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:27,078
So, Mom went on
a business trip?

320
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,231
She didn't take her cell phone?

321
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:35,048
She must have forgotten it.

322
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,062
Forgot her phone.

323
00:18:38,947 --> 00:18:40,402
Didn't say goodbye.

324
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,492
Dad, is Mom okay?

325
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:51,205
Your mom is fine, Ariel.

326
00:18:52,788 --> 00:18:53,440
She really is.

327
00:18:54,987 --> 00:18:56,273
And I promise you...

328
00:18:56,273 --> 00:18:58,095
she's gonna be back soon.

329
00:19:02,812 --> 00:19:03,911
So, now go to bed.

330
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,210
Stop it, Tom!

331
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:28,952
Stop what?

332
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:30,579
Not talking to me.

333
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,243
Fine. I'll speak.

334
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,034
Gee, Sandra,

335
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:35,716
I sure loved getting up
in the middle of the night,

336
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,227
and driving down
to the Spotted Pony,

337
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:39,333
and scraping my drunken
wife off a bar room floor.

338
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,968
All right!
I've changed my mind;

339
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:42,182
you can shut up again.

340
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,937
Yeah, I just love that.

341
00:19:43,937 --> 00:19:46,157
Well, I bet it wasn't half
as much fun as finding out

342
00:19:46,157 --> 00:19:47,903
your husband was cheating
on you.

343
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:50,587
Two days before
Valentine's Day, no less.

344
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:54,513
Where the hell are we?

345
00:19:54,513 --> 00:19:55,535
This is the road
to the cabin.

346
00:19:55,535 --> 00:19:57,728
And if you think I'm
driving to get you,

347
00:19:58,547 --> 00:19:59,670
driving you all
the way back home,

348
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,888
and then turning around
and coming back

349
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:02,302
to the cabin in the
morning, you're crazy.

350
00:20:07,846 --> 00:20:11,464
Light that up in here
and I will break your hand.

351
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:21,221
One puff.

352
00:20:22,328 --> 00:20:23,619
And I promise
I'll put it out.

353
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,257
I can count to one, Tom.

354
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:42,806
Oh, you unbelievable ass!

355
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:44,772
It's burning the upholstery!

356
00:20:47,327 --> 00:20:48,017
Holy!

357
00:21:01,498 --> 00:21:03,874
ff the phone
with the Prescott Police.

358
00:21:03,874 --> 00:21:04,967
Asked them to send a uniform up

359
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:06,550
to the O'Bannon's place
in the mountains.

360
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,832
No one was there.

361
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:09,082
In fact, they never showed.

362
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:10,552
Never showed?

363
00:21:12,557 --> 00:21:13,584
Not to be morbid

364
00:21:14,227 --> 00:21:16,095
but we've got to be thinking
the same thing here.

365
00:21:16,095 --> 00:21:18,181
That maybe those two had
a little accident

366
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:19,929
on the way to their cabin,
and now they're both, uh...

367
00:21:20,595 --> 00:21:21,742
no longer with us?

368
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:23,748
Maybe one of them is with us.

369
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:25,087
Spending a little time
with my wife.

370
00:21:26,571 --> 00:21:27,310
Look at the bright side--

371
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,904
at least you didn't wake up
as Mr. O'Bannon.

372
00:21:29,962 --> 00:21:31,565
At any rate, I'm going to, uh...

373
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:33,852
start checking with hospitals
along the route.

374
00:21:34,515 --> 00:21:36,362
Hey, uh, can you hold on
one second?

375
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:37,437
I got another call coming in.

376
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,261
Dubois residence.

377
00:21:40,826 --> 00:21:41,509
Mr. Dubois?

378
00:21:42,103 --> 00:21:44,122
The doctor has examined
your wife Allison.

379
00:21:44,122 --> 00:21:47,088
And he asked me to call and
report to you that she is awake,

380
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:49,139
and lucid, and has been asking
to see you.

381
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,929
Wait a second, uh, to see me?

382
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:55,086
Or her, uh... her other husband?

383
00:21:55,843 --> 00:21:57,023
You are Joe Dubois?

384
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,266
Yes.

385
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:00,300
Well, then you're the one
she's asking for.

386
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:06,826
Hey.

387
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:08,072
Husband.

388
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:12,147
Al?

389
00:22:14,205 --> 00:22:14,883
Joe.

390
00:22:16,328 --> 00:22:17,427
Allison.

391
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,183
Allison, Allison, Allison

392
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,230
It's so good
to have you back.

393
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,412
Joe. Joe.

394
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:29,192
Joe.

395
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,054
It's so good to be back.

396
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:33,420
Mr. Dubois?

397
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:38,982
I'm almost done here.

398
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,486
Um, could I borrow
your cell phone?

399
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:44,459
Check my voicemail?

400
00:22:51,192 --> 00:22:54,212
Yes, I need the number
for Prescott General Hospital,

401
00:22:54,212 --> 00:22:55,246
Patient Information.

402
00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:08,560
Yes. I need
information

403
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,045
on a patient named
Thomas O'Bannon.

404
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,818
Would have been admitted
night before last.

405
00:23:14,973 --> 00:23:15,673
Yes.

406
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:22,706
You.

407
00:23:24,253 --> 00:23:25,256
Well, don't just
stand there!

408
00:23:25,256 --> 00:23:26,443
Open the door!
Yes, ma'am.

409
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,693
I need you to take me to
Prescott General Hospital, now.

410
00:23:30,693 --> 00:23:31,492
Yes, ma'am.

411
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:37,015
Okay. Okay.

412
00:23:57,349 --> 00:23:58,202
Thomas O'Bannon?

413
00:23:58,202 --> 00:23:59,437
Room 116.

414
00:24:04,536 --> 00:24:05,254
Tom!

415
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:06,900
Thank goodness.

416
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,970
I was worried
you were really hurt.

417
00:24:10,537 --> 00:24:11,021
I'm sorry.

418
00:24:11,021 --> 00:24:11,892
Are you talking to me?

419
00:24:11,892 --> 00:24:13,222
Tom, it's me.

420
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:14,753
Tom? Who's
your friend?

421
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,979
Or have we met already?

422
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:17,807
I'm sorry,

423
00:24:18,547 --> 00:24:20,877
I've been a little hazy
since the accident, but...

424
00:24:21,624 --> 00:24:24,243
the doctors and
Tom assure me

425
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:25,750
that it will all
come back to me.

426
00:24:26,483 --> 00:24:27,580
And you are?

427
00:24:28,152 --> 00:24:29,011
I'm Sandra.

428
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:30,190
I'm Tom's wife.

429
00:24:31,623 --> 00:24:32,516
And you are?

430
00:24:32,516 --> 00:24:34,056
She's no one
we know, dear.

431
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,877
But thank you for
your concern, miss.

432
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,343
Tell you what I know.

433
00:24:43,343 --> 00:24:46,082
Someone matching Allison's
description took a town car

434
00:24:46,082 --> 00:24:47,983
from the state mental health
facility where you were,

435
00:24:48,853 --> 00:24:50,709
and asked to be driven
to Prescott General Hospital.

436
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:53,317
I'm about to drive out there
and find out what I can.

437
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:54,774
I'll call you as soon
as I know anything.

438
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,444
Thank you, Detective.

439
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,693
Girls, pizza's here!

440
00:25:06,223 --> 00:25:07,611
Everyone wash their hands!

441
00:25:11,816 --> 00:25:13,162
Hey, husband.

442
00:25:20,297 --> 00:25:20,918
Please.

443
00:25:23,971 --> 00:25:25,004
I need you.

444
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:28,925
I need your help.

445
00:25:31,115 --> 00:25:33,039
I don't have anyone else to ask.

446
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,744
I don't know where to go.

447
00:25:38,032 --> 00:25:39,595
Go talk to your husband.

448
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,746
Happy Valentine's Day.

449
00:26:04,746 --> 00:26:06,807
Oh, yeah. Right.

450
00:26:07,424 --> 00:26:09,403
Happy Valentine's Day.

451
00:26:10,175 --> 00:26:11,426
Hey, Mommy's home!

452
00:26:11,426 --> 00:26:12,931
Mommy's home!
Uh-oh.

453
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:14,608
Uh-oh.

454
00:26:15,317 --> 00:26:15,901
Mom!

455
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,215
Mom!

456
00:26:27,593 --> 00:26:28,212
Dad!

457
00:26:28,936 --> 00:26:29,642
I'm sorry.

458
00:26:29,642 --> 00:26:31,262
There's no way I
can pull this off.

459
00:26:31,947 --> 00:26:34,896
They're gonna know instantly
that I'm not your wife,

460
00:26:34,896 --> 00:26:36,202
that I'm not
their mother.

461
00:26:36,202 --> 00:26:37,836
Okay, you want
to figure this thing out?

462
00:26:37,836 --> 00:26:39,512
You want to get to the bottom
of this thing?

463
00:26:40,077 --> 00:26:41,359
We can't do it from here.

464
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:43,746
I promise you, this will work.

465
00:26:43,746 --> 00:26:45,293
It's Valentine's Day.

466
00:26:45,293 --> 00:26:48,440
Every year, Allison and I go out
to dinner on Valentine's Day.

467
00:26:49,862 --> 00:26:51,722
We just got to go out there,
say good night,

468
00:26:51,722 --> 00:26:53,518
and then we're out the door
and in the car.

469
00:26:53,518 --> 00:26:55,480
I don't know. I don't
know if I can do it.

470
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,035
I don't know about
these clothes.

471
00:27:00,477 --> 00:27:01,584
?

472
00:27:02,156 --> 00:27:03,451
Do you buy it?

473
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:05,540
Hmm?

474
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,117
I guess it's kind of
Valentine-y.

475
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:10,154
Um...

476
00:27:13,444 --> 00:27:14,681
Really?
Yeah.

477
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:17,634
You know that's gonna make
this dress a lot less exciting.

478
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:19,608
That's okay.
We have three kids.

479
00:27:19,608 --> 00:27:21,259
That's plenty
of excitement.

480
00:27:23,156 --> 00:27:23,727
All right.

481
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:26,931
All right.

482
00:27:27,777 --> 00:27:28,548
I can do this.

483
00:27:30,026 --> 00:27:32,717
Just remember,
it's Arianna, Belinda, Sheree.

484
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:34,716
Ariel, Bridgette
and Marie.

485
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:38,350
Maybe I'll just
call them "girls."

486
00:27:41,948 --> 00:27:44,105
Okay, kids, Mommy and I
are going out

487
00:27:44,105 --> 00:27:46,083
for a special
Valentine's Day dinner.

488
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,444
Ariel, you're the boss.

489
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:48,459
You're kidding!

490
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:49,793
But Mommy just got home!

491
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,404
And I haven't even
shown her the cards I got.

492
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,126
And she hasn't
given us hers.

493
00:27:54,804 --> 00:27:55,615
I know.

494
00:27:55,615 --> 00:27:56,706
It sucks, right, girls?

495
00:27:56,706 --> 00:27:57,981
So how was
your trip, Mom?

496
00:27:58,711 --> 00:27:59,906
Where'd you go?
What'd you do?

497
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:01,315
You know what?

498
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:02,822
I would love to know
the answer to that, too.

499
00:28:02,822 --> 00:28:03,905
But if we don't go
right now,

500
00:28:03,905 --> 00:28:05,124
we're gonna lose
our reservation, so...

501
00:28:05,124 --> 00:28:06,958
Didn't you need
your cell phone?

502
00:28:07,738 --> 00:28:09,005
You left it here.

503
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:09,940
Your pse, too.

504
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,812
That's another
excellent question.

505
00:28:11,812 --> 00:28:13,305
Boy, we got a lot
to talk about at dinner.

506
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:15,377
Bye, guys.
What about kisses?

507
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:17,929
Later, promise.

508
00:28:18,924 --> 00:28:20,121
Bye... bye, girls.

509
00:28:26,012 --> 00:28:27,286
Something's just not right.

510
00:28:30,726 --> 00:28:33,049
I need to check on
some things at my house.

511
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:35,659
Mmm. What do
you mean?

512
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:36,389
What things?

513
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:39,418
We're not gonna get
in any trouble are we?

514
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:40,803
It's the maid's
night off.

515
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:42,566
My husband's still
in the hospital.

516
00:28:42,566 --> 00:28:43,497
I think we'll be fine.

517
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:46,282
I just, I need to try
to find out...

518
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,352
more about her.

519
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:54,938
She must be very rich.

520
00:28:57,392 --> 00:28:59,163
Turns out, Tom likes rich.

521
00:29:01,415 --> 00:29:02,258
Which is funny,

522
00:29:02,258 --> 00:29:03,997
because he didn't
in the beginning.

523
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,912
Which is why I think
I found him so damn attractive.

524
00:29:08,786 --> 00:29:10,196
He wouldn't
let me buy dinner.

525
00:29:10,196 --> 00:29:12,304
He wouldn't let me
pay for a drink.

526
00:29:15,198 --> 00:29:16,794
But I guess I shouldn't
be surprised.

527
00:29:17,653 --> 00:29:18,632
Everyone likes rich.

528
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,116
At least, once they've had a...

529
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:23,125
free sample.

530
00:29:25,645 --> 00:29:27,457
Was she there today
at the hospital?

531
00:29:28,692 --> 00:29:29,912
That's the weird thing.

532
00:29:31,652 --> 00:29:33,100
I was there.

533
00:29:34,995 --> 00:29:36,344
And you should have
seen us together.

534
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:39,739
He was so tender,

535
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:42,366
in a way that
he hasn't been in years.

536
00:29:44,807 --> 00:29:45,562
It was as if...

537
00:29:45,562 --> 00:29:47,729
I don't even know
how to describe it.

538
00:29:48,508 --> 00:29:53,435
It was as if all of
the bad parts of our marriage

539
00:29:53,435 --> 00:29:56,302
were just knocked right out
of us in that car crash

540
00:29:56,302 --> 00:30:00,159
and some lighter, happier
version of Tom and me

541
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,235
just walked right out
of the wreckage.

542
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,352
The only problem is...

543
00:30:10,415 --> 00:30:13,139
I'm part of the baggage
that got left behind.

544
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:23,688
Just...

545
00:30:25,513 --> 00:30:27,510
take Scottsdale Road,

546
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,417
and I'll guide you
from there.

547
00:30:54,178 --> 00:30:55,043
It's nothing.

548
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:56,197
It's Mommy's cell.

549
00:30:57,177 --> 00:30:59,018
I can't believe she's still
running around without it.

550
00:31:00,009 --> 00:31:01,036
Hey, this is Allison.

551
00:31:01,036 --> 00:31:02,399
Leave a message at the tone.

552
00:31:04,002 --> 00:31:06,434
Hey. H.

553
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:08,284
Uh...

554
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:11,000
I don't know where you are,

555
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:13,942
but it's Valentine's Day.

556
00:31:15,371 --> 00:31:16,671
So Happy Valentine's day.

557
00:31:19,412 --> 00:31:21,642
You know, I got to tell you,

558
00:31:23,777 --> 00:31:25,947
hearing that message,
the one before the beep,

559
00:31:25,947 --> 00:31:27,518
that was the highlight
of my day.

560
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:32,143
At least I know that that's you.

561
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:36,762
Good God almighty, Allison.

562
00:31:38,828 --> 00:31:39,574
Where are you?

563
00:31:42,174 --> 00:31:43,435
I miss you.

564
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:01,054
Mrs. O'Bannon?
I'm up here!

565
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,331
It's been going on for years.

566
00:32:12,127 --> 00:32:15,517
There are letters
in that box from 2004.

567
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:18,880
Receipts forifts he
bought her with my money.

568
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,387
Cars. Jewels.

569
00:32:21,174 --> 00:32:22,361
How could I not have known?

570
00:32:23,696 --> 00:32:24,698
I'm truly sorry.

571
00:32:25,464 --> 00:32:28,236
But we probably ought
to get going. It's late.

572
00:32:28,236 --> 00:32:29,926
My kids have school tomorrow.

573
00:32:32,172 --> 00:32:33,533
I don't want to go anywhere.

574
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:39,723
I want to sleep in my own bed.

575
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,386
I have a horrible feeling

576
00:32:44,386 --> 00:32:46,303
it's gonna be the last time.

577
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,988
Here's the thing.
I can't go home without you.

578
00:32:49,988 --> 00:32:52,319
My kids will definitely
know something's up.

579
00:32:52,994 --> 00:32:56,244
I want to help you figure
this thing out, I do,

580
00:32:56,244 --> 00:32:58,169
but we have to go back
to my place.

581
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:01,445
Oh, my, is that the line

582
00:33:01,445 --> 00:33:03,450
you used on me
at the Spotted Pony?

583
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:05,328
Now, isn't Abigail

584
00:33:05,328 --> 00:33:08,066
old enough to watch
the others overnight?

585
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:09,701
Ariel. Uh, no.

586
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:12,262
That doesn't work.
It's a school night.

587
00:33:12,262 --> 00:33:13,826
Allison and I...

588
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:14,661
So, wait.

589
00:33:16,525 --> 00:33:18,935
The two of you have
never gone out and said,

590
00:33:19,674 --> 00:33:21,093
"Oh, screw it.

591
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,980
Let's stay out
all night and party?"

592
00:33:26,185 --> 00:33:28,076
Ah...that's hard to explain.

593
00:33:28,076 --> 00:33:28,935
But for me, uh...

594
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,760
being with Allison is the party.

595
00:33:35,618 --> 00:33:36,914
And for, Allison...

596
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,915
there's kind of no better
place to have a party

597
00:33:40,915 --> 00:33:42,655
than at home with the kids.

598
00:33:44,995 --> 00:33:45,551
God...

599
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:51,786
I would die to feel
that way about someone...

600
00:33:52,766 --> 00:33:54,030
some place.

601
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:57,343
I would die...

602
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:01,436
to have someone feel
that way about me.

603
00:34:05,649 --> 00:34:06,764
We really ought to get going.

604
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:21,118
So how are we going to do this?

605
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:22,723
What's that?

606
00:34:22,723 --> 00:34:24,281
The bed thing.

607
00:34:24,944 --> 00:34:28,627
I realize that we've
already slept together.
Don't worry.

608
00:34:28,627 --> 00:34:31,081
These things have a way
of working themselves out.

609
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:33,606
No, no, no, no. That's not
the answer I'm looking for.

610
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:37,891
Oh...

611
00:34:43,827 --> 00:34:45,344
You take the
Bridgette side.

612
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,332
I'll take the Marie side.

613
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:50,482
I'm sure you'll feel very safe.

614
00:34:56,598 --> 00:34:57,346
Holy!

615
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,403
Son of a bitch that hurt.

616
00:35:31,247 --> 00:35:32,361
Now would be a good time

617
00:35:32,361 --> 00:35:33,875
to come out of the woods
and give me a hand.

618
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:38,707
Please don't raise
your voice to me.

619
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:42,011
I've been sitting in this
scary forest in the dark

620
00:35:42,011 --> 00:35:44,040
since you dropped
me off three hours ago.

621
00:35:44,564 --> 00:35:45,835
I'm not in the mood.
Hey.

622
00:35:46,428 --> 00:35:49,096
I just slammed myself into
a tree at 35 miles an hour

623
00:35:49,096 --> 00:35:51,792
on purpose so you could have
weekend houses and foreign cars.

624
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:53,107
Let's not compare moods.

625
00:35:53,749 --> 00:35:54,778
Give me a hand with her.

626
00:36:02,962 --> 00:36:05,199
Grab her legs. There you go.

627
00:36:12,533 --> 00:36:13,535
Come on. Just drag her.

628
00:36:22,115 --> 00:36:22,964
Okay...

629
00:36:24,342 --> 00:36:25,266
we both know what to do.

630
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:26,885
I'll uncover the grave...

631
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,718
and we'll both lower her in.

632
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:31,593
What are you doing?

633
00:36:31,593 --> 00:36:33,742
Why are you turning away
from me? I've seen your body.

634
00:36:33,742 --> 00:36:35,244
Hell, I made it.

635
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:37,170
Not to mention your face.

636
00:36:38,085 --> 00:36:40,359
It's not you, it's her.

637
00:36:41,003 --> 00:36:43,074
I think she's still alive.
Huh?

638
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,192
Nothing's ever easy
with you dear, is it?

639
00:36:57,454 --> 00:37:00,465
Not that this isn't a lovely
stretch of road or anything,

640
00:37:00,465 --> 00:37:02,956
but I'm still a little fuzzy
as to what we're doing here.

641
00:37:02,956 --> 00:37:05,287
That's the spot.
Right there.

642
00:37:17,257 --> 00:37:18,254
Don't forget the shovel.

643
00:37:30,817 --> 00:37:32,453
Okay. So we're here?

644
00:37:32,453 --> 00:37:34,348
No. No, we're not.

645
00:37:58,607 --> 00:38:00,179
What is it? What
are you looking for?

646
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:07,184
Thank you.

647
00:38:09,405 --> 00:38:10,285
What did you just say?

648
00:38:10,939 --> 00:38:12,103
I said, "thank you."

649
00:38:13,051 --> 00:38:14,741
Sorry. It just slipped out.

650
00:38:15,935 --> 00:38:17,025
Give me a minute.

651
00:38:17,025 --> 00:38:18,439
I'll talk trash...

652
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:20,994
behave like a spoiled brat.

653
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:24,655
Go back to being the
repugnant human being

654
00:38:24,655 --> 00:38:26,033
that you've come
to know and love.

655
00:38:26,033 --> 00:38:28,262
That's okay.
"Thank you" works, too.

656
00:38:33,384 --> 00:38:33,988
What?

657
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:46,179
Oh.
Oh.

658
00:38:50,898 --> 00:38:53,354
That's you, isn't it?
No...

659
00:38:53,354 --> 00:38:57,133
no, no, not now.
No, not yet.

660
00:38:57,779 --> 00:38:59,833
I don't want it to be over.

661
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:03,138
I've still have so much
to do, so much to learn.

662
00:39:05,795 --> 00:39:07,605
Hey, Allison?

663
00:39:08,505 --> 00:39:10,969
Allison? Sandra? Allison?

664
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,778
Are you okay?

665
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,451
Are you okay?

666
00:39:16,302 --> 00:39:17,452
Are you okay?

667
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:28,378
I feel kind of whoozy.

668
00:39:29,605 --> 00:39:31,415
You were unconscious
for a while there.

669
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:33,838
You scared the
crap out of me.

670
00:39:36,473 --> 00:39:37,843
How did I get here, Joe?

671
00:39:39,948 --> 00:39:40,936
You don't remember?

672
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:44,455
Last thing I remember I was...

673
00:39:44,455 --> 00:39:47,122
getting a box of
Valentine cards for Bridge.

674
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:51,430
Do you think we're
gonna be here for long?

675
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,368
I still have to get
something for you.

676
00:40:19,904 --> 00:40:21,186
In a bizarre story,

677
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:23,629
prominent plastic surgeon
Dr. Tom O'Bannon

678
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,970
was charged with the murder
of his wife today

679
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:28,594
after he confessed
to staging a car accident.

680
00:40:28,594 --> 00:40:30,568
It was all part
of a plot to murder

681
00:40:30,568 --> 00:40:32,408
Mrs. Sandra Pinzler O'Bannon,

682
00:40:32,408 --> 00:40:34,631
heir to the Pinzler
oil fortune.

683
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:37,504
The couple, seen here
in their wedding photo,

684
00:40:37,504 --> 00:40:39,396
were apparently
on the verge of divorce

685
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:40,529
when the murder took place.

686
00:40:40,529 --> 00:40:42,792
Prosecutors believe
that in order to maintain

687
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:46,193
access to his wife's
inheritance, Dr. O'Bannon

688
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,589
concocted a bizarre plan

689
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:49,480
to have another woman
impersonate her.

690
00:40:50,049 --> 00:40:51,283
According to the indictment,

691
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:54,734
over the last year and a half
Dr. O'Bannon performed multiple

692
00:40:54,734 --> 00:40:56,762
plastic surgeries
on his co-conspirator

693
00:40:56,762 --> 00:40:58,830
and lover, Lisa Wolfe,

694
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,146
until she was virtually
indistinguishable

695
00:41:01,146 --> 00:41:02,134
from his wife.

696
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,188
Ms. Wolfe, seen here on the
right in a picture taken

697
00:41:05,188 --> 00:41:06,830
shortly after her arrest today,

698
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,418
is being held without bail.

699
00:41:09,038 --> 00:41:11,118
Had the ruse been successful,
Mrs. O'Bannon's fortune...

700
00:41:11,118 --> 00:41:13,474
Still getting caught up
on current events, I see.

701
00:41:15,185 --> 00:41:18,428
Well, I did lose three whole
days of my life, you know?

702
00:41:18,428 --> 00:41:20,349
Hmm, believe me, I know.

703
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:23,230
Speaking of which...

704
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:28,032
um, about
Valentine's Day...

705
00:41:28,032 --> 00:41:29,474
Oh yeah. Thank you.

706
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:33,316
For what?

707
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:35,676
When all this started,
I really hadn't

708
00:41:35,676 --> 00:41:37,295
had a chance to get
you anything.

709
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:39,076
I mean, I was going to.

710
00:41:39,076 --> 00:41:40,823
What are you talking about?

711
00:41:40,823 --> 00:41:42,457
I got your valentine.

712
00:41:43,152 --> 00:41:44,883
I just checked my voicemail.

713
00:41:49,122 --> 00:41:51,203
Now, don't you want to know
what I have for you?

714
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:53,803
Sure.

715
00:41:54,982 --> 00:41:56,121
Don't just sit there.

716
