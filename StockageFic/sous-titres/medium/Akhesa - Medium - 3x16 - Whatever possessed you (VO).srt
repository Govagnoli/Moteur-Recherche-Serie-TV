1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,800
WOMAN:
I hope you don't mind
decaf, Father.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,200
It's all we had
in the cupboard.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,900
A night this cold, I'll
take whatever I can get.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,300
Colleen's upstairs
when you're ready.

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,200
Colleen?

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,100
Colleen, it's me.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,100
It's all right!

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,900
Colleen, it's only me.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,500
I'm here to pray
with you.

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,200
F-Father?

11
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,200
Oh, Father,
I'm so sorry.

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,400
I-I didn't realize...

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,300
It's all right,
my child.

14
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,000
No, no, no, no,
it isn't all right.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,900
You're His emissary,
and I-I tried to hurt you.

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,200
I-I need to make it up to you.

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,800
I need to make it up to Him.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,900
I can hurt myself!

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,700
Please don't, Colleen.

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,500
He doesn't want that,
and neither do I.

21
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,500
Michael, Michael
buys them for me.

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,700
Mother doesn't know.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,200
She doesn't like me to have candy,

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,800
because
she thinks the sugar excites me,

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
but Michael knows
they make me happy.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,400
He let's me have two a day.

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,600
He counts them every day
to make sure that's all I have,

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,700
but I've only had one today,
Father,

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,500
and I want you
to have the other.

30
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,300
Hail Mary full of grace,

31
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,200
the Lord is with thee.

32
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,600
Blessed art thou among women

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,500
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

34
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,100
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for our sinners now

35
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,700
and at the hour of our death.

36
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,600
Amen.

37
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,100
Hail Mary, full of grace...

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,700
Hey.

41
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,300
Hey

42
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,800
Beds don't float,
do they?

43
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,900
Excuse me?

44
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,600
(sighs)
I mean, in your
experience,

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
as a rule, beds don't
float in midair, right?

46
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,300
Well, gosh, I would hope

47
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,600
that in the 14 or so years
that we've been together,

48
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,900
that once or twice
between the two of us,

49
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,000
our bed might have
left the ground,

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,700
but why do you ask?

51
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,700
It's nothing. It's crazy.

52
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,400
It's... it's stupid.

53
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,800
What are you doing?

54
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,200
I'm working on my rÈsumÈ?

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,300
Something you want to tell me?

56
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,700
Mm, yeah. No.

57
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,200
You're gonna think this is nuts,
but I had a dream.

58
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,800
Must be going around.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,500
You want to share?

60
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,100
Mm...

61
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,900
This thing going on
at work.

62
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,600
In the dream?

63
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,400
Uh, no, in real life.

64
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,600
Um, I can't really talk
about it,

65
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,400
but it's a tremendous
opportunity.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,500
And in the dream,
I go to my boss

67
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,600
and I say, "Mr. Canty,
I want this opportunity.

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
I want to run
this project."

69
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,200
You know what
he says to me?

70
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,100
He says to me, "Well, Joe,"I've just been waiting
for you to ask.

71
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,800
If you want something you got
to stop dragging your feet."

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,100
Wow, sounds like a good dream.

73
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,000
Hey.

74
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,400
The only man I know who starts
work earlier than I do.

75
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,100
Yeah, well, ever since
they changed the rules,

76
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,400
let people die 24 hours a day.

77
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,100
Guess that's why they call it
the "graveyard shift."

78
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,900
Ooh, graveyard shift. Very nice.

79
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,900
(chuckles)
So to what do I owe
this pleasure?

80
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,800
Got the call from the coroner
about 2:00 in the morning.

81
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,700
Saw your picture
in his wallet.

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,100
Apparently, he was having dinner at
the home of some friends last night,

83
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,600
went up to their study
to make a private call,

84
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
slipped and fell
on the stairs,

85
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,200
cracked his skull.

86
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,800
He had already expired by the time
the paramedics got there.

87
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,200
Are you, are you sure it's him?

88
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
There's no question.

89
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,400
How long did you guys
know each other?

90
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,300
Armando and I met the first
minute of the first day

91
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,400
of the first grade.

92
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,700
You know what?
I'm, I'm just going to, uh...

93
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,200
Sorry.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,400
ALLISON:
Did you give the kids
breakfast?

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,700
I certainly did.

96
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,400
Did you eat?

97
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,100
I certainly did not.

98
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,600
Nervous?

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,400
(sing-songy):
You're gonna get it.

100
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,300
You know, the Mars thing?

101
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
You're gonna get it.

102
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,200
Your boss is going
to give it to ya.

103
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,300
Who said anything about Mars?

104
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,900
Okay, forget Mars.

105
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,200
Mars, Venus, Jupiter--
whatever it is--

106
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,100
you're gonna get it,
that's all.

107
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,300
Allison Dubois has spoken?

108
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,700
Mm-hmm.

109
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,700
I'll be sure and tell my boss.

110
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,900
Yeah?

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Sorry, sir, I know you asked
not to be disturbed.

112
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,200
I just... thought you might need
this for jury selection.

113
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,300
I know you're preparing.

114
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,900
You don't have
to worry.

115
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,500
There's no preparation
going on in here.

116
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,900
I can't hold
a thought in my head.

117
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,900
You can just leave 'em.
Thanks.

118
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,100
Is everything all right?

119
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,000
Ah... I lost an old friend
last night.

120
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,200
I'm so sorry.

121
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,000
It's okay. He lived a good life.

122
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,000
Helped a lot of people.

123
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,300
Tripped and fell down
a flight of stairs,

124
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,700
cracked his skull.

125
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,700
When we were kids,
I once saw him walk on his hands

126
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,300
across a movie theater balcony
railing just to impress a girl

127
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,000
that was sitting down below.

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,200
Nobody does irony like God.

129
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,100
Armando Aguilar...

130
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,600
Uh, Father Armando Aguilar.

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,100
Oh, my God.

132
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,000
No, I know.

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,700
Trust me. (chuckles)

134
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,700
When we were growing up,

135
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,000
you would have
never seen it coming,

136
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,500
not in a million years.

137
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,700
Safe-cracker, maybe.
Gigolo,

138
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,600
well, he certainly
had the skill set,

139
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,000
but Catholic priest?

140
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,800
We're back to God and irony.

141
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,400
Happened yesterday evening
at the Fitzpatrick estate.

142
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,400
Fitzpatrick?

143
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,300
Like the Fitzpatrick plaza?

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,800
Yeah. Members of our parish.

145
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,300
They must be
devastated.

146
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,400
Oh. They've had a tough time.

147
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,300
Their only child, a grown
daughter took ill last year,

148
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,500
moved back in with them.

149
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,800
And now this.

150
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,900
I'm so sorry.

151
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,200
So if anybody asks,
I'm in here working away.

152
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,200
Absolutely, sir,
working away.

153
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Joe.

154
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,900
Do you have a minute?

155
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,700
Sure.

156
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,300
The Mars project.

157
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,800
Joe, there is no Mars project.

158
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,200
(chuckles)
Of course there isn't.

159
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,300
Uh, but if there were

160
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,300
and if we were contemplating
being involved

161
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,000
in the engineering
of the on-board systems,

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,500
I would really like to throw
my hat in the ring

163
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,800
to be considered
the project leader.

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You know
how this stuff works, Joe.

165
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,700
We don't call the tune
on these sorts of projects...

166
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,400
if there actually
are these sorts of projects.

167
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,000
My Uncle Sam does.

168
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,100
Well, let your uncle know
that I'm interested.

169
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
So let me get this straight.

170
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,300
You're happy because
you have a real shot at a job

171
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,400
that doesn't exist on a project
that your firm isn't doing.

172
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,600
I'm sorry.
I have no comment.

173
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,300
You will never
get it out of me.

174
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,100
You are a cagey one,
Mr. Dubois.

175
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Very hard to read,
highly inscrutable.

176
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh, I beg to differ.

177
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,800
You could scrute me
with a little effort.

178
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,300
Scruting is a
definite possibility.

179
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,300
Maybe I should have said
something.

180
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
And the point of
telling your boss

181
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,800
that you just saw his
newly-dead friend

182
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,800
<i>in a scene out
of the Exorcist</i>

183
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,600
would have been...?

184
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,100
Okay, obviously, it wasn't
a literal dream.

185
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,000
Obviously, that young woman's
bed didn't really float.

186
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,900
I must have that dream
for some reason,

187
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,900
don't you think?

188
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,600
Hello?

189
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Sorry, honey, I just got
an e-mail from Marcus.

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
"Dear Joe, I've
just been informed

191
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,200
"that a government polygraph
examiner will make himself

192
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,800
"available at our offices
tomorrow afternoon

193
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,900

00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,400

197
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,800
"If for some reason

198
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
please let me know
so that I..."

199
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Is everything all right?

200
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,100
Yes, actually, I think
everything is very right.

201
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,900
Mars...

202
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,400
Stop that.

203
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,200
Help me.

204
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,700
Give me strength.

205
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,500
What are you doing?

206
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,800
I'm looking
for something.

207
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,700
It's 4:30 in
the morning.

208
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,800
Hey, this is the girl I saw,
the one with the floating bed.

209
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,000
Colleen Fitzpatrick.

210
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
She's the one the priest
was praying with the night that he died.

211
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,700
This is a picture
from her wedding in 2003 before she took ill.

212
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,400
Pretty girl.

213
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,100
I wonder if she
can do that thing

214
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,400
where she makes her head
spin all the way around?

215
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,000
What? You told me last
night you thought

216
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,300
that this girl might
believe she had a
demon inside her?

217
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,700
It seems like a perfectly
legitimate question to me.

218
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,300
There are no such thing
as demons.

219
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,400
Said the psychic who
talks to ghosts.

220
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,900
Are there things that exist,
lie beyond this world?

221
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,100
Yes, absolutely.

222
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,400
Demons aren't one of them.

223
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,800
Okay, fine, demons
don't exist.

224
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,900
This girl does.

225
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,500
What's the big deal?

226
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,200
Well, the police are calling
the priest's death an accident.

227
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,900
It didn't look
that way to me.

228
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,100
It looked to me like
Colleen Fitzpatrick might have killed him.

229
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,800
Fitzpatrick?

230
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,200
The department
store Fitzpatricks?

231
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,000
They're members
of Devalos' parish.

232
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,700
The same one the dead
priest worked at?

233
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,400
Mm.

234
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,400
Oh, I wouldn't want
to be them at the
next church picnic.

235
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,200
Sir?

236
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,600
I know you're on your way
into court,

237
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,400
but I was afraid if I didn't
speak with you...

238
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,300
You holding up okay?

239
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,700
I didn't sleep
much last night,

240
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,100
but I guess that's
to be expected.

241
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,600
I tried putting the
time to good use.

242
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,000
I started working on a
eulogy for Father Armando.

243
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,600
Actually, he's the reason
I wanted to speak with you.

244
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,500
Oh?

245
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,800
I'm not certain that your
friend's fall was an accident.

246
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm guessing that
I'm not the only one

247
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,600
who didn't sleep
well last night.

248
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,700
You said the Fitzpatrick's
daughter wasn't well?

249
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,700
Colleen. She had some sort
of breakdown last year.

250
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,400
I don't know the specifics,

251
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,900
but I seem to recall
that it was serious enough

252
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,500
for her husband to consider
institutionalizing her.

253
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
But Colleen's mother
wouldn't hear of it.

254
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,100
They moved in with her,

255
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,100
and she's been caring
for her ever since.

256
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,800
What does this
have to do with...

257
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,600
Do you know if she's
prone to violence?

258
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,100
Colleen's mother, Helen,
showed up for Mass

259
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,300
a few months ago with
her arm in a sling.

260
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,900
No one actually said it,
but the sense I got

261
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,800
is that it had to do with...
caring for her daughter.

262
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,700
Are you implying...

263
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,100
I think that he was struck
in the head before he fell
down those stairs.

264
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,200
He was hit with something,
I don't know what it was.

265
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,500
Something heavy.

266
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,600
He was your friend.

267
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,000
I just... I think you need
to ask some more questions.

268
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,000
Is your name
Joseph Pritchard Dubois?

269
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,800
Yes, it is.

270
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,300
Are you an employee
of Aerodytech?

271
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,700
Yes, I am.

272
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Have you ever discussed
confidential work matters

273
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,000
with anyone
outside the company?

274
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,500
No, I have not.

275
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
Are you married?

276
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,900
Yes, 13 years.

277
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,500
Just a yes or no,
please.

278
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,800
Right. Sorry.

279
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,700
Do you ever work
on company projects while at home?

280
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Sometimes-- yes.

281
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,100
Is there any way
anyone at home

282
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,900
could gain unauthorized access
to company information?

283
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,400
No.

284
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,300
Let's take that one again.

285
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,900
(softly):
Oh. Manuel.

286
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,100
Helen.

287
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,600
I hope you'll forgive
the mess,

288
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,700
but we had a small army
of policemen

289
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,500
pass through her the night
of Father Armando's accident.

290
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,200
MAN:
Helen, have you seen
Colleen's new prescription?

291
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,100
I thought I saw it

292
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,000
in the upstairs bathroom last
night, but now I can't seem...

293
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,500
Oh, sorry.

294
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,900
I didn't realize
you had company.

295
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,100
Oh. Michael, you remember
our old family friend,

296
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,700
District Attorney
Manuel Devalos.

297
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,600
Right. Of course,
from the wedding.

298
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,200
Good to see you again, Michael.

299
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,000
Anyway, I'll keep looking
for those pills upstairs.

300
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,300
Actually, Michael,
if you have a moment.

301
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,500
I'm here on business, business
that involves you and Helen.

302
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,400
Just a few follow-up questions
regarding the statements

303
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,100
you gave the police
the other night.

304
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Would now be a good time?

305
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,600
Well, it was
a little after 9:00,

306
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,100
and we had just finished
our meal, when Father Armando

307
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,300
told me that he had
to make a private call.

308
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,300
And so I told him he
was welcome to use
the study upstairs.

309
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,300
And, uh, I was fixing
a cup of tea,

310
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,500
and Michael
was in the cellar

311
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,100
replacing a bottle of wine
that we hadn't opened.

312
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,200
And there was this
terrible crash from the foyer,

313
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,100
and I raced in
from the kitchen.

314
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,300
(softly):
And... he was at the bottom
of the stairs.

315
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,200
Alone?

316
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,700
Alone?

317
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,500
There was no third party
in the room?

318
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,600
No one other than you
and Armando?

319
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,800
That's correct.

320
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,300
May I ask where Colleen was
when this was happening?

321
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
She was in her
room, sleeping.

322
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,900
The commotion
didn't wake her?

323
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,100
She'd had a very
challenging day.

324
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,300
We'd given her a little
something to help her sleep.

325
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,800
Is something wrong,
Manuel?

326
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,400
I've just come from
the Medical Examiner's office.

327
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,400
I asked them to take a second
look at Armando's injuries.

328
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,400
They now feel that he may have
sustained a blow to the head

329
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,100
<i>before he fell
down your stairs.</i>

330
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
I don't understand.

331
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,600
How can they
say one thing one day

332
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,400
and then something completely
different the next?

333
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,600
They also found
a partial fingerprint

334
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,100
in a spot of blood
on the good Father's forehead.

335
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,700
I'm sure you'll both recall
that Colleen was arrested

336
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,600
for erratic driving shortly after she took ill
13 months ago.

337
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,600
We ran the fingerprints
we had on file for her

338
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
against the one we found
on Armando,

339
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,800
and I'm sorry to say
it was a perfect match.

340
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,200
<i>ALLISON:
Absolutely.</i>

341
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,200
I'll see you tomorrow.

342
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,300
Devalos?

343
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,900
(sighs)
Colleen Fitzpatrick
did kill Father Armando.

344
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,900
They found the murder weapon

345
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,300
at the top of the stairs on a
table-- it was a wooden bookend.

346
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,500
Ouch.

347
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Her mother and her husband found
her standing over the body.

348
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,700
They knew about it
the whole time.

349
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,600
So what happens now?

350
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,100
Everyone goes to jail?

351
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
No. Devalos feels like
the family's suffered enough.

352
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,100
He's not going to charge them
with obstruction.

353
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,900
And if the girl's
found incompetent,

354
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,500
she won't even
stand trial.

355
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,400
Her psych evaluation
is tomorrow.

356
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,400
I hope I did
the right thing.

357
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,600
What are you
talking about?

358
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
I don't know,
maybe it's my imagination,

359
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,800
it just... sounded like Devalos

360
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,600
was sadder
now that he knows the truth.

361
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,500
I think he preferred it
when he thought

362
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
his friend's death
was a simple accident.

363
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,800
(sighs)
This is one of those moments

364
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,300
I'm not sure that my gift
is such a gift.

365
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,800
I know what you mean.

366
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,100
Can I ask you something?

367
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,900
Are you sure I'm going
to get this thing?

368
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,200
What thing?
What are you talking about?

369
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,000
The promotion?

370
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,600
Yeah, I'm sure.

371
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,400
At least
I think I'm sure. Why?

372
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,700
It's just that
everything was going
fine this morning.

373
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,600
I was doing great, and
then, the polygraph guy

374
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
starts asking me
questions about home

375
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,200
and if there was any
way that anyone here

376
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,400
could find out things
that they shouldn't know,

377
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,000
and then I remembered what
happened the other morning.

378
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,400
What happened
the other morning?

379
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,600
You remember--
what you said

380
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,000
when you were getting
out of the shower?

381
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,400
What did I say?

382
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,600
I'm not going to say; I'm
not going to remind you.

383
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,400
That would just
defeat the whole point.

384
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,200
What point?

385
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,700
I don't know what
you're talking about?

386
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
You talking about
that joke I made about you going to Mars?

387
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Shh.

388
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,400
What "shh"?

389
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,500
Who could hear us?

390
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,600
Wait a second.

391
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,500
Are you really going
to Mars?

392
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,100
I don't know.

393
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,800
Based on the way today
went, probably not.

394
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,800
Is that what this
is all about?

395
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,200
That I guessed right?

396
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,200
Guess?

397
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,500
You're telling me
that was a guess?

398
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,500
No, it's worse than that.

399
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,000
It wasn't even a guess.

400
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,700
It was a joke.

401
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,900
A joke?

402
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,800
You're kidding.

403
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,400
A joke?

404
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,400
<i>HELEN:
What was that noise?</i>

405
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,600
(in distance):
Is everyone okay?!

406
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,100
Oh, my God.

407
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,300
Oh, my God, Colleen,
what have you done?

408
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,200
Answer me, Colleen.

409
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,400
What have you done?

410
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,800
Oh, my God.

411
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,000
Father, you're going
to be okay.

412
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,200
We're going
to get you some help.

413
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,100
Michael! Where are you?

414
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,200
We need to call 911.

415
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
WOMAN:
Please, Colleen, I know
it's hard, but I need you

416
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,300
to sit and concentrate.

417
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,900
No. N-N-N-N-No. No.

418
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,800
I need you
to tell us

419
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,200
what was going
through your mind

420
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
when you hurt
Father Armando.

421
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
I didn't hurt Father Armando.

422
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,700
You did, Colleen.

423
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,900
You hurt him very badly,
and you know that.

424
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,500
No, you're wrong.

425
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,000
I didn't do anything.

426
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,500
Are you trying to tell us
that somebody else hurt him?

427
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,600
The demon inside you?

428
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,700
It's okay, Colleen,
you can tell us.

429
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,600
We're your friends.

430
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
I can see your words,
you know.

431
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,100
I can see them.

432
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,300
How dark they are,
how twisted.

433
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,100
Like a long, black ribbon.

434
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,500
Please, Colleen, don't.

435
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,200
I know you now.

436
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
I know who you are.

437
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The great whore.

438
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,800
The great whore
that sitteth
Colleen, sweetie, you need

439
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,100
upon many waters
to calm down
right now, okay?

440
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,900
with whom the kings
of the earth

441
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,900
have committed fornication.

442
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,500
I know you, whore!

443
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,000
I can see your words.

444
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,400
I can see them all,

445
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,900
whore, I can
see them.

446
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,200
<i>WOMAN:
Colleen has been getting worse</i>

447
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,700
the last few weeks,
more delusional

448
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,900
more violent
during our sessions.

449
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,500
You've been treating
her for how long now?

450
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,800
13 months.

451
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,200
Then she wasn't
under your care prior to her breakdown?

452
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,700
It's my understanding,
Mr. Devalos,

453
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,900
that prior
to her breakdown,

454
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,100
Colleen was a perfectly happy
and healthy woman

455
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,700
with no need whatsoever
for somebody in my line of work.

456
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,400
I'm sorry to say

457
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,300
I never had the pleasure
of meeting that Colleen.

458
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,400
It sounds like she changed
pretty suddenly.

459
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,800
About a year
and a half ago,

460
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,100
Michael came
home from work

461
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,600
and, apparently, she was
hysterical, terrified.

462
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,400
She had called the police
thinking that she had seen

463
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,400
something monstrous
in her house, some
sort of creature.

464
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,300
Demonic creature?

465
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,800
There's always been
a religious theme

466
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,500
to Colleen's
hallucinations--

467
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,400
demons, possession.

468
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,300
I tend to attribute
it to the fact

469
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,800
that she was such
a devout woman
before she took ill.

470
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,900
But you were the one who
diagnosed her, correct?

471
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,700
Undifferentiated
schizophrenia.

472
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,000
Yes, that's true, but
to be perfectly honest,

473
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,800
it's a bit of a catchall
as far as diagnoses go.

474
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,600
I'm sorry.
I don't follow.

475
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,000
It's used
when the patient's symptoms very clearly point
to schizophrenia,

476
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,100
but are so clouded

477
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,100
that classifying the type
of disorder is very difficult.

478
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,000
If I may ask you,
Dr. Randall,

479
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,400
what's so cloudy about
Colleen's symptoms?

480
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,500
She's prone
to delusional episodes

481
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,400
but has long stretches
of lucidity in between.

482
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,200
True schizophrenia
doesn't work that way.

483
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,000
It's far more
consistent.

484
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,800
I've also given her any number of neuroleptics--

485
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,300
drugs that should treat
the symptoms of schizophrenia--

486
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,600
but none of them seem
to have any effect on her.

487
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,200
I'm sure there's some sort
of explanation for this,

488
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,900
but I haven't
been able to find it

489
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,200
Hey.
Hey.

490
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,600
You know that project
that we're not doing to do?

491
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,000
The one I can't speak
to you about?

492
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,600
You should just forget about it.

493
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,700
Whoa. Wait a second, Marcus.

494
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,200
Your wife.

495
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,900
She's some type
of consultant, right?

496
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,900
Has something to do
with the government?

497
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,800
She works part time for the
District Attorney's office.

498
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,700
Why?

499
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,000
I don't know, but she's
a red flag for them,

500
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,600
a big red flag.

501
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,400
The polygraph
examiner picked up

502
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,800
some deception when you
were asked about her.

503
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
And now, they've
considered her to be,

504
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,000
uh, some sort
of security risk.

505
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,100
That is absurd.

506
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,900
Doesn't matter. There isn't...

507
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,800
such a project.

508
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,400
It's not like you had
something that you lost.

509
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,700
It was never here
for you to have.

510
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,900
Wait, what? Marcus?

511
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,900
This is not the end
of the conversation.

512
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,600
Surely, there must be some
kind of a work-around.

513
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,400
A work-around for a government
security clearance?

514
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,500
I don't think so.

515
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,900
Well, think harder, Marcus.

516
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,800
You know what an asset
I would be to this.

517
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,700
L-Let me take, let me
take the test again.

518
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,500
This is not like something
that you can cram for, Joe.

519
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,900
You're either telling
the truth or you're not.

520
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,500
Of course I'm telling the truth.

521
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,100
Well, I know one expert
who disagrees.

522
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,600
I've worked for this
company for 15 years.

523
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,800
I've never put
them at risk.

524
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,900
This is not
the company talking.

525
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,900
All right, fine,
but there must be a
call that you can make.

526
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,600
Isn't there a string
that you can pull?

527
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Please.

528
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,900
<i>ALLISON:
It's 'cause of me, isn't it?</i>

529
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,600
They can sense that you can sense that
I might be able to...

530
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,300
rifle through your thoughts

531
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,700
if I wanted to?

532
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,900
Hmm... I don't know.

533
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,400
They sense something.

534
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,800
Funny thing is...

535
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,400
I don't know
what this project is.

536
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,200
I know it has something
to do with Mars.

537
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,700
Beyond that...

538
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,100
I know it has something
to do with space.

539
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,000
I know what space
means to you.

540
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,200
I remember
the night we met.

541
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,800
You picked me up
at that bar,

542
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,400
you brought me
back to your place,

543
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,300
showed me your...
telescope.

544
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,600
You showed me your books
on the cosmos.

545
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,600
You showed me your lunch box
from the third grade

546
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,800
with rockets and planets.

547
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,700
And you thought,
"What a nerd."

548
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,600
And I thought...

549
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,700
"I think I have
to sleep with this man.

550
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,500
I think I might have
to marry this man."

551
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,300
And now it's me standing between you
and your other love.

552
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,300
I love you.

553
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,400
And I love you.

554
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,900
<i>HELEN:
Michael, is that you?</i>

555
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,100
Hey, sorry I
missed dinner.

556
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,600
I got pulled into
a late meeting.

557
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,200
Don't give it a second
thought, dear.

558
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,400
I made you a plate
and put it in the fridge.

559
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,500
Oh, thanks.

560
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,100
Was that Father Armando's
car I saw in the driveway?

561
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,300
(phone ringing)
Yes, he's upstairs
visiting Colleen.

562
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,500
Don't you need to get that?

563
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,800
Work.

564
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,200
They can call me on
the landline if they
really need me.

565
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,600
FATHER ARMANDO:
...pray for us sinners now

566
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,000
and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

567
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,500
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

568
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,700
Blessed art thou
among women

569
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,500
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

570
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,100
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

571
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,600
and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

572
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,900
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

573
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,200
Blessed art thou
among women

574
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

575
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,700
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

576
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

577
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,300
Hail Mary,
full of grace...

578
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,000
Dr. Elizabeth Randall, please.

579
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,600
Thank you.

580
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,500
Hey. Sorry I couldn't answer.

581
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,900
Mother Fitzpatrick was standing
right in front of me.

582
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,000
Yeah, she's got
the priest here again.

583
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,900
Guess she still thinks
the power of prayer is going to make a difference.

584
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,100
Honestly, darling?

585
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,300
I don't know what it's going
to take to get Helen

586
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,500
to put Colleen in a home.

587
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,300
Yeah, well... I miss you, too.

588
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
If Helen turns in early,

589
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,500
maybe I'll try to swing
by your place later.

590
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,200
FATHER ARMANDO:
Oh, dear God, no!

591
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,600
Something's up.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

592
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,800
Give me strength.

593
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,200
What is it, Father?

594
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,200
Her bed.

595
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,800
It's floating.

596
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,600
Do you see it?

597
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,500
Michael, do you see it?!

598
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,800
Having an affair with
your wife's physician is not against the law.

599
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,400
I mean, it's not nice, but
it's not against the law.

600
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,000
At least I don't
think it is.

601
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,900
How's this?

602
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,200
Does this look honest?

603
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,900
Yes, you look honest,
you look thoroughly honest.

604
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,700
'Cause you are honest.

605
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,300
So be honest and tell me what do
I do about this bed thing?

606
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,900
Do I tell Devalos?
Tell Devalos what?

607
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,800
That in your dream his
friend was having delusions

608
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
about free-floating furniture?

609
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,900
I mean, if you tell him that,

610
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,000
he's gonna send you
home for the day.

611
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,300
(sighs)
I, uh... I think it's over.

612
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,100
You know who died,

613
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,000
and you know how
it happened.

614
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,200
You know everything.

615
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,500
Okay, then why do I keep
dreaming about all of it?

616
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,900
(sighs)
That I don't know.

617
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,200
Okay. Look, I know you have
other things on your mind.

618
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,500
I know you think this horse
is already dead

619
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,300
and you can't figure out
why I keep beating it.

620
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,800
No.

621
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,600
Well, yeah.

622
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,600
I'm sorry, I'm
nervous about today.

623
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,400
I'm just starting to think

624
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
that I should have forgotten
about the whole thing.

625
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,100
You know,it's not a test test,
it's a lie detector test,

626
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,700
and I failed, and I don't
know what made me think

627
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,000
that I would pass it if I
got a second shot at it.

628
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,400
Okay. Well, if you know that...

629
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,100
What can you do?

630
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,300
You in there and...
tell the truth.

631
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,500
I mean, really,
what else can you do?

632
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,000
You go in there
and you tell them the truth.

633
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,800
And after that,
it's out of your hands.

634
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
What?

635
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,700
It's not like I didn't tell
the truth the first time.

636
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,700
Fine. If you say so.

637
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,100
<i>ADMINISTRATOR:
Is your name
Joseph Pritchard Dubois?</i>

638
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Yes.

639
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,600
Have you ever discussed
confidential work matters

640
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,600
with anyone
outside the company?

641
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,100
No, I have not.

642
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,100
Is there any way
anyone at home

643
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,000
could gain
unauthorized access

644
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,900
to company information?

645
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,100
Is there any way
anyone at home

646
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,000
could gain
unauthorized access

647
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,400
to company information?

648
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,800
Yes.

649
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,600
Yeah, I suppose there is.

650
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,800
I'm sorry, did you

651
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
just answer
in the affirmative?

652
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,900
Yes. Yes, I did.

653
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,500
You're saying
that there is a way

654
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,900
that someone could gain
unauthorized access

655
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,500
to company information,

656
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,600
but you don't discuss

657
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,800
confidential matters
outside the office?

658
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,100
That's correct.

659
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,200
Is this person
in question your wife?

660
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,400
Yes. Yes, it is.

661
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,100
Is she a computer hacker?

662
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,000
No.

663
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,700
Do you talk in your sleep?

664
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,800
No.

665
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,300
Can she read your mind?

666
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,500
Yes.

667
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,900
As a matter of
fact, she can.

668
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,100
She can read your mind?

669
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,900
That's correct.

670
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,300
She can pluck thoughts
from your head?

671
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,400
Your wife possesses
psychic abilities.

672
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,100
Yes.

673
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,100
So, Mr. Dubois,

674
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,600
you're telling me
that your wife

675
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,400
finishes your sentences

676
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,800
and, um, can often tell
when you're lying,

677
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,100
that sort of thing?

678
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,500
That's correct.

679
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,600
Well, what do you know?

680
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
My wife is psychic, too.

681
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,800
Thank you very much.

682
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,000
We're done here.

683
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,600
Did I pass?

684
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,600
Well, why don't you call
your wife and ask her?

685
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,900
Talk to me.

686
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,200
JOE:
You were right.

687
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,200
So I take it the truth
set you free.

688
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,400
It certainly felt a lot better
the second time around.

689
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,800
So now I guess we just
hold our breath.

690
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,600
What for? You got it.
I'm sure of it.

691
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,100
Hmm. From your lips
to Uncle Sam's ear.

692
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,600
You sound like
you're in the car.

693
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,300
I'm playing messenger girl.

694
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,300
Devalos had some papers
that he needed

695
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,400
Dr. Randall to sign
at the institute.

696
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,200
I offered to run them
over there.

697
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,200
Out of the goodness
of your heart?

698
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,500
Oh, out of the badness
of my...

699
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,700
what, I don't know, dirty mind?

700
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,200
I just want to look her
in the eye.

701
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,200
It seems like a dangerous
conflict of interest to me.

702
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,100
I mean, she's sleeping
with that poor woman's husband.

703
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,100
Well, just remember,
it may mean nothing at all.

704
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,300
(sighing):
Yeah. Well, I hope so.

705
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,200
Mrs. Dubois, right?

706
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,000
Oh, y-yes. Hello again,
Mr. Barlow.

707
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,100
I was just dropping these
papers off for Dr. Randall.

708
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,500
The nurse at the front desk
told me I could find her here.

709
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,900
Oh, she had to take a call.

710
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,500
She said she'd be right back.

711
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,400
You're welcome to wait
if you'd like.

712
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,400
ALLISON:
How's she doing adjusting to her
new surroundings?

713
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,400
Uh, it's hard to say.

714
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,600
Dr. Randall prescribed
some new sedatives.

715
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,300
She's been sleeping a lot.

716
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,900
Sorry, again,
about yesterday.

717
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,000
I'm sure that wasn't
an easy thing to watch.

718
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,400
You know what they say--
everything happens for a reason.

719
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,800
As it goes,
I think it's exactly

720
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,700
what the district attorney
needed to see.

721
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,800
Made it easy for him
to recommend that she

722
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,000
be kept here, as opposed
to awaiting trial in prison.

723
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,700
You're right-- everything
happens for a reason.

724
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,100
NURSE:
Mr. Barlow?

725
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,100
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to take these.

726
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,600
Take them?

727
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,800
We have a very
strict policy here regarding outside food.

728
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
I'm sorry.

729
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,700
Yeah, but they're not food.

730
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,400
I mean, not technically.
They're candies.

731
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,700
My wife has one
or two every day.

732
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,200
She really
looks forward to them.

733
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,100
I'm sorry,
there can be no exceptions.

734
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,000
No, wait a second.
You're not listening to me.

735
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,600
My wife needs those.

736
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,500
They're a great
comfort to her.

737
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
I only had one today, Father.

738
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
I want you to have the other.

739
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,100
RANDALL:
Is there a problem here?

740
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,100
NURSE:
I was just explaining

741
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,200
to Mr. Barlow that we don't
allow outside food

742
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,700
under any circumstances.

743
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,900
And I was just explaining to her
that it's very important

744
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,800
that my wife have a piece
of candy to look forward to every day.

745
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,100
I think we can make an exception
just this once, don't you?

746
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,100
But, Dr. Randall...

747
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,400
They're nothing, nurse.

748
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,200
Just little balls
of sugar.

749
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,300
I don't see how
they could do any harm.

750
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,200
You're the doctor, Doctor.

751
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,200
NURSE:
Excuse me.

752
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,700
What if I told you
I have reason to believe

753
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,400
that Colleen Fitzpatrick
isn't sick at all?

754
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,700
I'm sorry--
you think she's faking?

755
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,000
Let's just say I don't believe
that she's crazy,

756
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,400
and I don't believe
she's possessed.

757
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,300
But I need your help to prove it.

758
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Manny.

759
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,600
Test results just came back.

760
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,300
And?

761
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,000
Allison was right.

762
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,100
You want us to go
scoop these monsters up?

763
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,500
Yeah.

764
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,800
I do.

765
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
<i>No, Stanley,
you're not listening.</i>

766
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,200
As of today, every account is
supposed to have my name on it.

767
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
Yes, even Colleen's trust.

768
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,900
Well, that's what
power of attorney means.

769
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
Stanley, I'm going to have
to call you back.

770
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,600
Michael Barlow?

771
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,300
Yes.

772
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,200
You're under arrest
for the murder of Father Armando Aguilar.

773
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,400
You have the right to remain silent.
What?

774
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,900
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

775
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,800
No, this is wrong.
in a court of law.

776
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,700
My wife is the one
who killed Father Armando.

777
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,200
...if you can't afford an attorney,
That was Colleen.

778
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,900
one will be
provided for you.
This is crazy.

779
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,000
Crazy, huh?

780
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,300
It's a good thing I picked up a psychiatrist
on the way over here.

781
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,600
Her name's
Elizabeth Randall.

782
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,100
I think you
two have met.

783
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,900
<i>HELEN:
Lysergic acid?</i>

784
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,300
LSD.

785
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,200
We found significant
amounts of it

786
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,000
in Father Armando's system
after we exhumed him.

787
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,500
We're still running
Colleen's blood work,

788
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,200
but I'm confident we'll
find it in hers as well.

789
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,600
I don't understand, Manuel.

790
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,300
Are you telling me
she isn't sick?

791
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,400
It's our belief that
every last one of the symptoms

792
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,300
she's experienced over the past
13 months-- the hallucinations,

793
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,900
the paranoia,
the violent outbursts--

794
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,600
were all drug-induced.

795
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,900
The stretches
of lucidity between,

796
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,300
the days that she would act
and sound like the old Colleen,

797
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,300
those were just recovery periods
between dosings.

798
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,100
But I've hardly ever left

799
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,100
Colleen's side
this past year.

800
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,800
I never saw Michael
give her a single pill,

801
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,500
a single injection.

802
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,400
It was the candies.

803
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,000
He covered each one
with a liquid form of the drug.

804
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,400
And by making them
her daily treat,

805
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,700
he could count on her
self-medicating.

806
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,500
The only thing he didn't
count on was Colleen

807
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,100
offering Father Armando a candy
during his last visit.

808
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,500
We believe that Michael
killed the good Father

809
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,400
because he knew that once
the effects of the LSD wore off,

810
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,000
Armando would start
asking questions,

811
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,800
probably realize
that Colleen was being dosed.

812
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,100
But all those doctors
I took her to,

813
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,000
all those specialists,

814
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,300
why didn't they ever detect
the drug in her system?

815
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,600
LSD doesn't show up
in most blood screenings.

816
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,400
You have to know
that you're looking for it.

817
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,700
You have to run
a very specific test.

818
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,300
And the fact that Michael's
partner in crime, Dr. Randall,

819
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,200
was Colleen's primary physician
didn't help matters any.

820
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,300
She could always run
interference for Michael,

821
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,000
throw any other doctors off the scent.

822
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,100
And all this... cruelty

823
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,900
just to get around a
prenuptial agreement?

824
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,600
If Colleen had died
or divorced Michael,

825
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,500
he would've ended up
with nothing.

826
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,400
If she were to lose
her mind, however,

827
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,800
be declared incompetent,
he could stay married to her

828
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,200
and still have access
to your family's fortune.

829
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,600
It's gonna be okay,
Helen.

830
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,900
It's gonna be fine.

831
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,600
Colleen's working the drug
out of her system

832
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
for the very last time,

833
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
and it's my understanding
that once she does,

834
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,400
she's going to make
a full recovery.

835
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,400
You're going to get
your daughter back.

836
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,600
So let me get
this straight.

837
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,500
The reason we get to
stay up an extra half hour

838
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
and eat cake is because
Daddy got put in charge

839
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,100
of some really
cool project.

840
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,500
That is correct.

841
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,800
Only you can't tell us
about this really cool project

842
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,400
because it's top secret.

843
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,300
That is also correct.

844
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,800
Can we at least have a hint?

845
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,900
ALLISON:
Okay, on that note,

846
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,900
come on, you little
security risks.

847
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,400
It's time
to hit the hay.

848
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,300
Joe, you got Bridge?

849
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,100
Yes.

850
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,800
Come on, kiddo.

851
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,300
Time for bed.

852
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,800
But I don't want
to go to bed.

853
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,000
I like staying up late.

854
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Really? You got a funny way
of showing it.

855
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,700
Congratulations
again, Daddy.

856
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,100
If you can't get
that ship up to Mars,

857
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,300
nobody can.

858
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:31,700
