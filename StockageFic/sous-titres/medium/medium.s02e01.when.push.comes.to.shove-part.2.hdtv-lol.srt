1
00:00:01,922 --> 00:00:03,355
Mommy's not taking us again today.

2
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:04,760
Look around. Do you see Mommy?

3
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:06,656
I don't mind working as a human lie detector,

4
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:09,842
but it's been four nights in a row now,

5
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:11,968
and frankly, my family is starting to lose it.

6
00:00:12,343 --> 00:00:13,099
We just got a call.

7
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:14,668
Apparently, he struck again.

8
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:16,731
He takes their hearts.

9
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:19,413
Carves it right out of their chest.

10
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:22,391
Doesn't have anything to do with sex.

11
00:00:23,878 --> 00:00:24,721
It's biblical.

12
00:00:25,953 --> 00:00:29,250
They called an ambulance for Mr. Push sometime after 3:00 this morning.

13
00:00:29,884 --> 00:00:31,759
You came to visit me in my bedroom.

14
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:33,344
It was around 3:30 in the morning.

15
00:00:33,478 --> 00:00:34,479
I thought that I was dreaming.

16
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,846
Alison, they're related.

17
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:38,957
You must have died for a minute or two.

18
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:40,985
What's related?

19
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:42,131
The murders, the victims,

20
00:00:42,357 --> 00:00:43,104
the ones he chooses.

21
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:44,549
It's not random.

22
00:00:45,143 --> 00:00:48,812
According to their DNA markers, both women have the same father.

23
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:49,905
Look what Daddy brought.

24
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,061
I'm uncorking that at 9:15.

25
00:00:55,777 --> 00:00:57,017
Shall we synchronize our watches?

26
00:00:57,731 --> 00:00:58,246
Just go.

27
00:01:02,494 --> 00:01:04,116
I want you to forget about all this.

28
00:01:05,703 --> 00:01:08,028
I want you to concentrate on getting better.

29
00:01:12,204 --> 00:01:12,829
Sorry I'm late.

30
00:01:15,294 --> 00:01:16,763
So, how did it go with the kids?

31
00:01:34,212 --> 00:01:34,669
Hello?

32
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:38,041
Alison? Ken Push.

33
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:39,632
Let's get some rest.

34
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,604
And I'll see you soon, okay?

35
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:45,778
Not if I don't see you first...

36
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:47,890
okay?

37
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:50,068
Okay.

38
00:01:51,037 --> 00:01:51,261
Bye.

39
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:12,979
"Prepare slaughter for his children

40
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:15,809
"for the iniquity of their fathers,

41
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:19,880
"that they do not rise, nor possess the land,

42
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:22,901
nor fill the face of the world with cities."

43
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:25,446
Isaiah, Book 23,

44
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:29,199
Chapter 14, Verse 21.

45
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,556
He's baaaaack.

46
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:36,834
He's broke.

47
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:39,978
Do I have to?

48
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:41,675
Don't you have ten of these on file already?

49
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:43,542
Well, just sign it.

50
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:44,791
I'll fill out the rest.

51
00:02:46,943 --> 00:02:48,104
You want a dirty magazine?

52
00:02:49,132 --> 00:02:50,894
Uh, actually...

53
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:53,709
I want you.

54
00:02:56,955 --> 00:02:58,218
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I'm going to lose my job.

55
00:02:58,694 --> 00:02:59,182
No, you won't.

56
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,393
You're helping to make some poor, childless couple happy.

57
00:03:03,348 --> 00:03:04,499
No one could fire you for that.

58
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:20,384
Well, if you're just going to sit there,
you better hand me one of those magazines.

59
00:03:24,382 --> 00:03:24,775
Okay.

60
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:34,177
But no touching.

61
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:43,415
- Hi.|- Hey.

62
00:04:45,092 --> 00:04:45,608
Any dreams?

63
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:48,409
Hmm-mm.

64
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:50,659
So, you ready for what's next?

65
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,439
That's the spirit.

66
00:04:56,037 --> 00:04:56,768
But I don't understand.

67
00:04:56,961 --> 00:04:58,539
You didn't go to France to make it,

68
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:00,722
so why do they call it French toast?

69
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:03,209
They didn't go to France to get French fries, either.

70
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:04,221
Idiot.

71
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,423
- Hi.|- Hey.

72
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,732
Uh-uh. What kind of talk is that on the first day of school?

73
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:10,526
Sixth graders do not call people idiots.

74
00:05:11,822 --> 00:05:14,719
French toast, French fries, French vanilla ice cream--

75
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,000
they were all invented in France.

76
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,101
The original recipes came from France.

77
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,778
What about French kissing?

78
00:05:23,507 --> 00:05:25,572
Oh, that-- uh, that was invented here.

79
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,464
By me.

80
00:05:39,496 --> 00:05:40,167
All right, so I'm out of here.

81
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:41,629
- You got school covered?
- Yes, I do.

82
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:42,968
Dropping off, picking up--

83
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:44,163
covered, covered, covered.

84
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,724
And we're going shopping for school supplies.

85
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:50,066
Okay, you know I got that thing at 5:00, right?

86
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,427
Thing at 5:00. School supplies.

87
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:53,735
7:00, dinner.

88
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:54,979
Done.

89
00:05:58,631 --> 00:05:59,299
It's not personal, you know.

90
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:00,539
I know.

91
00:06:01,124 --> 00:06:03,588
Believe me, no one wants to put you back to work more than I do.

92
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:06,328
In fact, I'd gladly go out and kill someone myself

93
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:07,601
if I thought I could get away with it.

94
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:11,819
But right now, thankfully, Phoenix is quiet.

95
00:06:12,692 --> 00:06:13,824
You want to go through the cold case files?

96
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:15,899
That's probably good for a day's pay.

97
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:17,219
I did that last week.

98
00:06:18,206 --> 00:06:19,511
So, anything new on the Phantom?

99
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:22,849
Allison, what "new" are you expecting?

100
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:26,318
Look...

101
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,988
I'm as frustrated as you are.

102
00:06:30,482 --> 00:06:31,959
Once we figured out that the victims were related

103
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:34,469
because their father was the same anonymous sperm donor,

104
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:36,360
I thought we were 70% of the way there.

105
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:40,035
Unfortunately, all the sperm donations were made in the '80s,

106
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,176
and both facilities both here and in Texas,

107
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:43,440
are long since out of business.

108
00:06:44,295 --> 00:06:45,902
But there have to be records for health reasons.

109
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:46,688
Oh, there are.

110
00:06:47,645 --> 00:06:48,097
We think.

111
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:49,198
We hope.

112
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:53,538
The FBI assures me that there are agents poring through bankruptcy court

113
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:57,615
filings in both states trying to unearth the location of any relevant medical archives.

114
00:06:58,372 --> 00:07:00,007
The good news is whoever he is,

115
00:07:00,381 --> 00:07:01,414
whatever he wanted, it...

116
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:02,986
seems to be over.

117
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:04,476
It seems to have stopped.

118
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:06,258
It happened just like he said it would.

119
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,017
What did Captain Push call it--

120
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:09,330
a storm?

121
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:14,173
Three kids dead, eight days, then...

122
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,594
it was gone.

123
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:19,233
Any more dreams?

124
00:07:20,752 --> 00:07:21,712
Not since May.

125
00:07:24,004 --> 00:07:25,135
Nothing since May.

126
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:29,276
How's he doing?

127
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:31,396
He's the same.

128
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:35,313
Say hi for me, will you?

129
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,573
Well, the Houston Astros won again,

130
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:09,135
6-4 against the Cardinals.

131
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:17,102
There's still rain in the Panhandle.

132
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:21,716
Oh, uh, the governor called you yesterday.

133
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:25,678
He wanted you to know his thoughts were with you.

134
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:38,390
You're a damn ignoramus, you know that, Kenneth Push?

135
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:41,699
Cutting those wires so, what?

136
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,625
Huh? So you could tell me he was a sperm donor?!

137
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:45,796
That was the big news?!

138
00:08:46,712 --> 00:08:48,064
That that's how they were all related?!

139
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,495
That was worth trying to kill yourself for?!

140
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,611
Well, we got that!

141
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:56,225
Two days later, the victims' mothers told us that.

142
00:08:57,127 --> 00:08:59,114
And now, look at you: here you are-- nowhere.

143
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:00,332
In a coma.

144
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:01,913
You're no use to anybody.

145
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:08,079
Whose idea was it for you to seek therapy?

146
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,092
I told you. My wife and I 
went through a difficult period a couple of months ago.

147
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:16,543
Once things cooled down and we talked about what had happened,

148
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:18,526
it was one of the promises that I made.

149
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,778
We each...

150
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:21,140
made promises.

151
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:22,641
And what did she promise?

152
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:24,431
I don't know. Uh...

153
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:26,119
be more considerate, mostly.

154
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,144
Of who? Of what?

155
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:32,461
Of me, I guess... mostly.

156
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:34,863
And how long ago was this?

157
00:09:35,349 --> 00:09:37,765
Uh, three months or so; just before the summer.

158
00:09:38,562 --> 00:09:40,132
What took you so long to get in here?

159
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,533
I don't know.
It was summer.

160
00:09:42,675 --> 00:09:45,355
The weeks got away from me, and when I finally did call, you were on vacation.

161
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:48,787
So, what does that make me, Doc--

162
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:51,521
bipolar, codependent, manic-depressive?

163
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:54,786
Homosexual.

164
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:02,664
Is your wife typically inconsiderate of you?

165
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:06,706
Typically, my wife is anything but inconsiderate.

166
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,173
If anything, she suffers from an overabundance of empathy.

167
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,779
It's a kind of disease with her.

168
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:14,858
She experiences it with almost everyone she encounters:

169
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,193
friends and neighbors, strangers.

170
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,018
Dead people.

171
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:23,730
And how do you account for this lapse?

172
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:25,518
Lapse?

173
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,156
Well, you said you made some sort of bargain.

174
00:10:29,012 --> 00:10:30,831
She'd be more considerate; you'd go into therapy.

175
00:10:31,975 --> 00:10:34,760
I'm guessing her excessive empathy was not in evidence

176
00:10:35,043 --> 00:10:37,769
when whatever it was that happened to precipitate the bargain...

177
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:39,552
happened.

178
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:41,839
You know what?
It was nothing. It was stupid.

179
00:10:41,977 --> 00:10:44,497
I acted like an ass, to be perfectly honest with you.

180
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:46,056
Tell me.

181
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:48,590
There's nothing to tell.

182
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:49,543
It was...

183
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:54,620
Her work got intense.

184
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:57,209
She was home less and less.

185
00:10:57,609 --> 00:10:59,448
One night, we made a plan; she didn't make it.

186
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:01,684
She didn't call, and I got angry.

187
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:05,093
But in the scheme of things, it really, it was no big deal.

188
00:11:07,255 --> 00:11:09,100
She didn't even call?

189
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,155
No.

190
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:15,931
Oh, you know, it sounds profoundly inconsiderate to me.

191
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:18,037
What is your wife?

192
00:11:18,902 --> 00:11:20,193
Is she a brain surgeon?

193
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:22,806
Was she in surgery or something?

194
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:28,887
No, she, uh, she works as a legal consultant.

195
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:30,979
I don't know.

196
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:35,104
That sounds profoundly inconsiderate to me.

197
00:11:35,349 --> 00:11:36,451
No, you're misunderstanding...

198
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,535
Well, that's our session for today.

199
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:41,944
Terrific meeting you, Mr. Bourgeois.

200
00:11:44,987 --> 00:11:45,955
"Mr. Bourgeois"?

201
00:11:46,723 --> 00:11:49,227
Inspires a lot of confidence, don't you think?

202
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:52,472
So what else did he say?

203
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,012
I don't remember. Nothing important.

204
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,228
Did you tell him about me?

205
00:11:57,624 --> 00:11:58,737
Why, you think you're important?

206
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:02,669
Obviously you were a big part of the conversation.

207
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:04,869
But you didn't tell him...?

208
00:12:05,815 --> 00:12:06,574
About your secret?

209
00:12:07,506 --> 00:12:12,465
How you came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men.

210
00:12:13,224 --> 00:12:13,849
Shut up.

211
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:17,198
If you don't want to go anymore, you don't have to go anymore.

212
00:12:18,365 --> 00:12:20,220
I mean, it seems kind of silly now.

213
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:22,110
We're still here.

214
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:25,106
Everything's good.

215
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:28,338
Least I think it is.

216
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:29,629
Is it?

217
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,876
I mean, it is for me.

218
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,904
I just, I can't help but wonder about you.

219
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:38,100
You mean because of the dreams?

220
00:12:38,361 --> 00:12:39,270
I mean all of it.

221
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:41,085
You're not working.
You're not dreaming.

222
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:44,126
But I'm fine. I'm really fine.

223
00:12:46,076 --> 00:12:46,456
Okay.

224
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:48,866
I don't know.

225
00:12:49,197 --> 00:12:50,455
Maybe I'll cancel next week.

226
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:51,706
I don't know.

227
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:55,563
Are you sure he didn't say anything about me?

228
00:12:58,739 --> 00:12:59,406
Actually, he did.

229
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:05,293
He said you sounded like you were profoundly beautiful.

230
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:08,813
"Profoundly beautiful."

231
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:13,096
I like that.

232
00:13:17,044 --> 00:13:17,561
Who pees first?

233
00:13:18,337 --> 00:13:18,726
Oh, my God.

234
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:20,521
It's my birthday.

235
00:13:21,486 --> 00:13:23,908
And it's my apartment, so, obviously, I pee first.

236
00:13:24,313 --> 00:13:26,556
But I'm older, and I actually drank more than you,

237
00:13:26,877 --> 00:13:30,261
and besides, it's past midnight, so it's not your birthday anymore.

238
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:34,315
So, keep your cool, cross your legs, and before you know it, it will be your turn.

239
00:13:43,342 --> 00:13:45,759
Hurry up!
I'm don't want to fall asleep and wet the bed!

240
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:50,657
I don't want to alarm you, but I actually peed a couple of swizzle sticks.

241
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:53,218
Don't worry.
They flushed fine.

242
00:13:53,393 --> 00:13:55,058
Didn't stop up your commode, or anything.

243
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:57,415
Hey, you don't mind if I take a moment and wash my hands, do you?

244
00:13:57,685 --> 00:13:58,936
You have nothing but time, right?

245
00:13:59,593 --> 00:14:00,232
Ya-da-dee,

246
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:02,325
ya-da-di...

247
00:14:03,895 --> 00:14:05,954
Hey, your teeth floating yet?

248
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:07,924
All right, it's your 18th birthday.

249
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,604
I guess I can let you void your pretty little self.

250
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:12,983
Hey.

251
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,905
Chris, the, uh, the door is stuck.

252
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,129
Chris, not funny.

253
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:20,104
Open the door!

254
00:14:21,656 --> 00:14:22,174
Chris?

255
00:14:24,176 --> 00:14:25,042
Chris!

256
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:28,071
At the top of our news,

257
00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:29,880
the apparent abduction of Christina...

258
00:14:30,225 --> 00:14:31,621
I'm hearing it for the first time right now.

259
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:33,923
...returned home from an 18th birthday celebration.

260
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:38,572
Lovel, who, according to her boyfriend, was snatched sometime after 1:00 in the morning

261
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,241
after her abductor locked him in the bathroom...

262
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:44,380
Hey, hey, hey. What's going on there?!

263
00:14:45,171 --> 00:14:47,154
It's not my fault.
She didn't say when.

264
00:14:47,288 --> 00:14:49,278
No, I would love to meet you at the crime scene.

265
00:14:49,392 --> 00:14:52,132
It's just that school just started again, and I'm not dressed. I...

266
00:14:53,156 --> 00:14:53,887
It's Devalos.

267
00:14:54,222 --> 00:14:56,337
He and Scanlon are meeting at the crime scene in half an hour,

268
00:14:56,473 --> 00:14:57,773
and he was wondering if I could get down there.

269
00:14:58,177 --> 00:14:59,389
I've got a project briefing at 8:45.

270
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:01,561
No way I can get there before 10:00.

271
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,216
He's got to be in court at 10:00.

272
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:07,153
Mommy didn't finish covering my books last night, and she promised.

273
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,364
That's not fair.

274
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:10,707
No, that's not going to fly.

275
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,464
You don't know my husband.

276
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,801
Okay, Detective Scanlon said that if you can drop the kids off at school,

277
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:18,673
he'll send a police car to pick me up in 20 minutes.

278
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:23,422
And he says if you won't pick up the kids,

279
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:27,412
he will send three police cars with their sirens blaring to pick me up in 20 minutes.

280
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:29,875
What?

281
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:32,939
Go ahead. Throw on some clothes.
I'll make some calls.

282
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,195
I'll make it work somehow.

283
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:36,355
- Are you sure?
- Sure, I'm sure.

284
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:37,568
What choice do I have?

285
00:15:37,822 --> 00:15:39,105
You're obviously profoundly...

286
00:15:43,646 --> 00:15:44,142
happy.

287
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:48,023
With all due respect, my dear, you, me, the police department, and yes,

288
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:51,217
even His Honor the Mayor, are now at the mercy of the FBI and the federal

289
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:56,776
bankruptcy courts, so if you would kindly take a second and get your pointy shoes out of my ass,

290
00:15:57,032 --> 00:16:01,038
perhaps we could strategize as to what we're going to do to get those two august bodies

291
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:02,148
to speed this thing along.

292
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:10,745
What you looking at?

293
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:15,227
Why don't you come over here and see for yourself?

294
00:16:19,383 --> 00:16:20,183
Nice to see you.

295
00:16:20,802 --> 00:16:21,881
What's it been, a couple months?

296
00:16:22,057 --> 00:16:23,169
Thought maybe you quit the business.

297
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:25,279
Nope. Business quit me.

298
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:28,589
You know how it is: you can't find a good violent crime when you need one.

299
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:33,861
So, what makes everybody so sure this has anything to do with The Phant...

300
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:37,863
Isaiah.

301
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,117
There he be.

302
00:16:40,627 --> 00:16:43,437
Didn't even notice till ten minutes ago when I switched on the light.

303
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:48,618
You know what stinks?

304
00:16:49,797 --> 00:16:50,587
People are dying?

305
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:52,884
That goes without saying,

306
00:16:53,094 --> 00:16:55,635
but what really stinks is the way this guy keeps making asses out of us.

307
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:56,973
We can't figure out

308
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:57,654
who he is.

309
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,862
We can't find his records, but he's found them.

310
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,825
Somewhere along the way, he found them, and was able

311
00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:04,914
to get the name and address of every child he fathered.

312
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,174
Tell me you had a dream.

313
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:15,537
Tell me you can unwind this thing.

314
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,507
Actually, I haven't had a dream in months.

315
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:22,043
It's like it's all stopped up in there or something.

316
00:17:22,149 --> 00:17:23,046
I don't know.

317
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:29,229
Is there a bathroom I can use without destroying any evidence?

318
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:30,828
You all right?

319
00:17:31,262 --> 00:17:32,031
Yeah, I'm just...

320
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,346
The crime scene boys took over a vacant apartment at the end of the hall.

321
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:36,750
Suddenly, I just...

322
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:56,988
Ms. Dubois, can you hear me?

323
00:17:59,414 --> 00:18:00,260
Ms. Dubois?

324
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:08,954
Can one of your cars take me over to St. Christopher's Hospital right away?

325
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:09,837
You all right?

326
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,924
No, it's not me. It's Captain Push.

327
00:18:13,256 --> 00:18:14,418
I think he might be dead.

328
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:16,688
My name's Allison Dubois.

329
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,847
I'm with the District Attorney's office.

330
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:22,044
I've been calling for the last hour on the condition of Captain Kenneth Push.

331
00:18:22,493 --> 00:18:23,209
Who are you, family?

332
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:24,625
Please, just tell me.

333
00:18:25,181 --> 00:18:27,055
I'm sorry, miss, unless you're family...

334
00:18:28,046 --> 00:18:28,890
I... wait!

335
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,064
He's not in there.

336
00:18:44,413 --> 00:18:44,859
Mrs. Dubois?

337
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:48,021
Mrs. Dubois?

338
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:50,677
Don't cry.

339
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:53,045
There's no reason to cry.

340
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,321
How can you say that?

341
00:18:56,444 --> 00:18:59,834
Because I'm dead, and everything that matters--

342
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:01,965
matters to me, anyway--

343
00:19:02,261 --> 00:19:02,954
I can see.

344
00:19:04,568 --> 00:19:05,855
I know how it works out.

345
00:19:06,992 --> 00:19:08,505
I know how it all works out.

346
00:19:09,128 --> 00:19:10,067
You do, huh?

347
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,954
Oh, you see everything, you know everything?

348
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:16,168
Well... do you know this?

349
00:19:17,772 --> 00:19:20,747
Do you know that I hate what you've done to yourself?

350
00:19:21,068 --> 00:19:23,338
Do you know that I hate what you've done to me?

351
00:19:38,392 --> 00:19:39,966
One, two, three.

352
00:19:42,387 --> 00:19:42,765
Sorry.

353
00:19:44,945 --> 00:19:45,978
Here you go, Captain.

354
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:48,550
That's nice.

355
00:19:50,765 --> 00:19:51,730
Nice and clean.

356
00:19:52,353 --> 00:19:53,953
Teeth brushed, face shaved.

357
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:07,150
I don't understand. You're not dead?

358
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:11,545
Well, he's not... but I am.

359
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:14,004
I don't understand.
How is that possible?

360
00:20:15,103 --> 00:20:19,851
Well, I smoked too much, drank too much, lived too hard, but my son...

361
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:22,543
Your s... your son?

362
00:20:25,577 --> 00:20:27,002
You're Captain Push's father?

363
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:28,252
Yes, ma'am.

364
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,091
Oh, wow.

365
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,340
I thought you knew that this morning in the bathroom.

366
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:34,735
That was you?

367
00:20:36,883 --> 00:20:40,799
So... he's not dead?

368
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,143
No, ma'am.

369
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,377
You know...

370
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:51,945
...when you die, ain't much else to do but watch your own.

371
00:20:53,216 --> 00:20:54,250
So, when he cut them wires...

372
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:57,397
I was waiting for him.

373
00:20:58,937 --> 00:21:02,106
I was there when he saw what he saw and tried to tell you about it.

374
00:21:04,236 --> 00:21:05,598
When he tried to send you his dream.

375
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:08,064
Yeah, I got that.
I got his dream.

376
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:10,110
It was worthless.

377
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:12,021
The whole thing has been worthless,

378
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:14,355
a waste of a really great life.

379
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:15,582
That's not true.

380
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:18,271
And that's what I'm here to tell you about.

381
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:20,841
The waste was yours.

382
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:23,249
You didn't dream the whole dream.

383
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:25,147
You cut it off. You put yourself in it.

384
00:21:25,831 --> 00:21:28,220
You were too preoccupied with what was going on in your own life

385
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:30,085
to see what he was trying to show you.

386
00:21:30,337 --> 00:21:32,900
You'd have seen you're chasing the wrong man.

387
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:35,377
What, what are you talking about-- "the wrong man"?

388
00:21:36,993 --> 00:21:37,804
Do you know who he is?

389
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:39,400
No.

390
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,673
They brought him back to life before he had a chance to tell me, but...

391
00:21:45,184 --> 00:21:47,710
even if I knew, it's not for me to say.

392
00:21:48,376 --> 00:21:49,708
He's the one trying to talk to you.

393
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:52,337
You got to dream the dream.

394
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,054
I can't. I haven't dreamt in months.

395
00:21:58,535 --> 00:22:00,434
And you won't ever again...

396
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:02,896
unless you finish it.

397
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,101
You got to finish it.

398
00:22:09,648 --> 00:22:10,346
You got to dream it.

399
00:22:26,572 --> 00:22:27,243
The wrong man?

400
00:22:27,828 --> 00:22:28,906
I know it's not what you want to hear.

401
00:22:29,972 --> 00:22:31,470
DiNovi, Lynn DiNovi.

402
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,881
And I've been on hold for 20 minutes.

403
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:35,950
I understand that the Director of the Bureau is a very busy man,

404
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,983
but I've got the District Attorney of Phoenix standing here,

405
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,692
and he's about to be summoned to court.

406
00:22:41,922 --> 00:22:42,763
A message you can slip him?

407
00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:46,798
Sure. Tell him we've got a guy running around here cutting out people's hearts,

408
00:22:46,947 --> 00:22:49,307
and we were wondering if he has a suggestion as to

409
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:51,468
what we could use to get the bloodstains out of the sidewalk.

410
00:22:52,036 --> 00:22:54,748
You wouldn't happen to know who the right man is, would you?

411
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:56,265
Not specifically, no.

412
00:22:56,769 --> 00:22:58,948
Allison, the mayor, the governor, the chief of police--

413
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:01,949
every branch of government is putting pressure on the FBI

414
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,573
to find those records and get us a name--

415
00:23:04,124 --> 00:23:05,737
the name of the man who fathered those children.

416
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:07,664
I'm aware of all that.

417
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:11,255
"Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers":

418
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:14,475
that's the message the killer leaves at the scene of every murder.

419
00:23:14,714 --> 00:23:16,618
I know. I've been at the scene of almost every murder.

420
00:23:16,745 --> 00:23:18,168
Then think about what you're saying.

421
00:23:18,457 --> 00:23:19,788
The only thing these victims have in common

422
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,234
in that they were fathered by the same man; that's it.

423
00:23:22,523 --> 00:23:24,268
Now, you tell me: who else could it be?

424
00:23:24,496 --> 00:23:25,265
I don't know.

425
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,808
Allison, people are hysterical; the media's gone crazy;

426
00:23:29,017 --> 00:23:29,980
the city's in a panic;

427
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,034
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to call the powers

428
00:23:32,132 --> 00:23:34,097
that be and tell them to disregard the one lead--

429
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,164
the only lead-- that we have.

430
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:39,477
And I like Mr. Grusten, but I don't like Mrs. Laker.

431
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:42,861
And I like Ms. Villa, but I'm not sure about Ms. Fritz.

432
00:23:43,302 --> 00:23:44,967
Boy, you sure have a lot of teachers.

433
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:48,424
It's the sixth grade. Everyone has a lot of teachers in sixth grade.

434
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,083
Well, you can't argue with that.

435
00:23:51,385 --> 00:23:52,507
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

436
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,222
- Daddy?|- Yes?

437
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:57,549
I don't understand.

438
00:23:57,999 --> 00:23:58,933
I'm in the sixth grade.

439
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,018
Why am I going to bed the same time as a first grader?

440
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:04,941
Hey, it's not my fault I'm in first grade. I got born late.

441
00:24:06,448 --> 00:24:07,435
Uh, Mom?

442
00:24:08,665 --> 00:24:11,007
Well, that is an excellent question.

443
00:24:11,595 --> 00:24:11,961
I know.

444
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:14,090
But I think Dad and I need to sleep on it.

445
00:24:14,926 --> 00:24:16,181
It's only 8:00.

446
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:18,319
I don't think letting her stay up till 8:30...

447
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:19,814
Well, see, look.

448
00:24:20,212 --> 00:24:21,769
Looks like you already have Dad in your corner.

449
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,150
Yeah.

450
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,555
- Night.|- Night.

451
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,660
Do you want to tell me what just happened in there?

452
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:33,166
Nothing happened in there.

453
00:24:33,449 --> 00:24:35,763
An 11-year-old girl just asked her parents for a later bedtime,

454
00:24:36,115 --> 00:24:37,578
and her mother said she'd like to sleep on it.

455
00:24:38,317 --> 00:24:39,830
And what is it you're doing right now?

456
00:24:40,576 --> 00:24:42,047
I am getting ready to sleep on it.

457
00:24:43,444 --> 00:24:45,502
Uh, this, this, like, this rush to bed--

458
00:24:45,682 --> 00:24:49,294
this... wouldn't have anything to do with me, would it?

459
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:52,208
Oh, yes, oh, my, yes.

460
00:24:53,132 --> 00:24:53,754
Mm-hmm.

461
00:24:59,652 --> 00:25:00,761
Aren't you forgetting something?

462
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:02,769
No. I brushed.

463
00:25:03,524 --> 00:25:05,004
No. I meant, uh...

464
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:08,229
me.

465
00:25:19,302 --> 00:25:21,895
Captain Push's late father came to visit me today.

466
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,636
He told me that I completely misread the dream

467
00:25:25,837 --> 00:25:28,226
that his son risked his life trying to send me;

468
00:25:30,323 --> 00:25:31,225
that I didn't finish it;

469
00:25:32,126 --> 00:25:34,637
that if I ever hoped to find out who the Phoenix Phantom was,

470
00:25:35,687 --> 00:25:37,158
if I ever hoped to dream again...

471
00:25:39,468 --> 00:25:41,434
then I needed to re-dream Captain Push's dream.

472
00:25:42,777 --> 00:25:43,899
I needed to finish it.

473
00:25:44,956 --> 00:25:45,944
And you want that?

474
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:48,592
They're looking for the wrong man, Joe.

475
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:50,222
As long as they're looking for the wrong man,

476
00:25:50,412 --> 00:25:51,627
there's a possibility somebody else might die.

477
00:25:52,132 --> 00:25:53,914
Okay, that wasn't what I asked you.

478
00:25:58,078 --> 00:25:59,104
When that phone rang this morning,

479
00:25:59,701 --> 00:26:01,031
and you heard that they wanted you at the crime scene,

480
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:06,074
you were positively giddy. You know that?

481
00:26:08,157 --> 00:26:09,427
Why do you look so disappointed?

482
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,201
I saw the shrink.

483
00:26:18,988 --> 00:26:22,495
He kept trying to tell me you were profoundly selfish.

484
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:34,536
Not profoundly beautiful.

485
00:26:35,771 --> 00:26:36,624
But I don't know.

486
00:26:36,901 --> 00:26:37,692
I think it's me.

487
00:26:39,132 --> 00:26:40,693
I like it better when you're all mine.

488
00:26:42,807 --> 00:26:46,829
When the girls and I don't have to share you with your dreams,

489
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,625
with the cops... with...

490
00:26:58,361 --> 00:27:00,208
You think that makes me  profoundly selfish?

491
00:27:06,096 --> 00:27:06,968
Come here.

492
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:10,898
Hold me.

493
00:27:14,406 --> 00:27:15,583
Help me dream.

494
00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:45,362
He's baaaaack.

495
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:48,695
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I'm going to lose my job.

496
00:27:49,442 --> 00:27:50,010
No, you won't.

497
00:27:51,112 --> 00:27:53,120
You're helping to make some poor, childless couple happy.

498
00:27:54,134 --> 00:27:55,406
No one could fire you for that.

499
00:28:12,115 --> 00:28:14,355
If you're going to just sit there,
you better hand me one of those magazines.

500
00:28:18,044 --> 00:28:18,712
Okay...

501
00:28:29,786 --> 00:28:30,486
but no touching.

502
00:28:34,257 --> 00:28:35,101
You're crazy, you know that?

503
00:28:36,627 --> 00:28:37,886
That church is making you crazy.

504
00:28:38,228 --> 00:28:39,652
I mean... you're my wife.

505
00:28:40,543 --> 00:28:41,401
It's not about that.

506
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,955
I know what it's about.

507
00:28:43,603 --> 00:28:45,567
It's safe. It's perfectly safe.

508
00:28:45,812 --> 00:28:46,442
I read about it.

509
00:28:46,575 --> 00:28:48,080
We can do... whatever.

510
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,554
We can do anything.

511
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,051
I can't help it.

512
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:55,051
I love this baby. I don't want anything to happen to this baby.

513
00:28:55,729 --> 00:28:56,640
Nothing's going to happen.

514
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:59,095
How do you think the baby got here in the first place?

515
00:29:00,512 --> 00:29:01,318
Forget that.

516
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,216
Let's just do this.

517
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,512
Just finish what you're doing.

518
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:06,771
Come on. We need the money.

519
00:29:08,477 --> 00:29:09,415
Don't you hear that?

520
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,371
It's for you.

521
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,273
Mmm.

522
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:19,597
Hello?

523
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,519
Allison, hi, it's Manuel Devalos.

524
00:29:21,758 --> 00:29:23,453
I'm very sorry to wake you in middle of the night.

525
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:26,215
We found the body of Christina Lovel.

526
00:29:27,006 --> 00:29:28,294
He hung it from a freeway overpass.

527
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:32,298
Painted the word "Isaiah" with her blood all along the trestle.

528
00:29:33,108 --> 00:29:34,277
Oh, I'm so sorry.

529
00:29:35,003 --> 00:29:35,639
That's not all.

530
00:29:36,144 --> 00:29:37,181
The FBI finally called.

531
00:29:38,571 --> 00:29:40,818
Oh, my God, that's great.
That's really, really great.

532
00:29:41,709 --> 00:29:43,063
Did you find him? Did you get him?

533
00:29:43,446 --> 00:29:44,739
Uh, we... found him.

534
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,447
Soon as we had a name, we found him.

535
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:51,590
The only thing is... he's been dead since 1997.

536
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:19,379
I met your dad.

537
00:30:21,224 --> 00:30:22,164
Seemed like a nice man.

538
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,209
You want some light?

539
00:30:38,238 --> 00:30:39,046
There you go.

540
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:42,878
I'll sit down.

541
00:30:57,275 --> 00:30:58,093
But no touching.

542
00:31:01,761 --> 00:31:02,491
You're crazy, you know that?

543
00:31:04,032 --> 00:31:05,393
That church is making you crazy.

544
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,328
I mean... you're my wife.

545
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:08,852
It's not about that.

546
00:31:09,338 --> 00:31:10,232
I know what it's about.

547
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:13,089
It's safe. It's perfectly safe.

548
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:13,893
I read about it.

549
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:15,511
We can do... whatever.

550
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:16,984
We can do anything.

551
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:18,636
I can't help it.

552
00:31:20,023 --> 00:31:22,665
I love this baby. I don't want anything to happen to this baby.

553
00:31:23,154 --> 00:31:24,327
Nothing's going to happen.

554
00:31:24,477 --> 00:31:26,515
How do you think the baby got here in the first place?

555
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:28,582
Forget that.

556
00:31:29,842 --> 00:31:30,420
Let's just do this.

557
00:31:30,962 --> 00:31:31,753
Just finish what you're doing.

558
00:31:33,372 --> 00:31:34,265
Come on. We need the money.

559
00:31:40,895 --> 00:31:41,851
What are you doing?

560
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,391
I'm getting out of here.

561
00:31:44,754 --> 00:31:45,839
What do you mean you're getting out of here?

562
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:46,851
How are we going to pay the rent?

563
00:31:47,422 --> 00:31:48,441
Don't know. Don't care.

564
00:31:50,381 --> 00:31:51,845
I'm going back home to Texas.

565
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,398
I want a divorce.

566
00:31:55,467 --> 00:31:56,637
Uh... a divorce?

567
00:31:57,727 --> 00:31:59,404
You can't get a divorce. We're having a baby.

568
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,345
It's 1983, darling. Anyone can get a divorce.

569
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:06,647
Oh, my God. You are the man my daddy said you were.

570
00:32:08,605 --> 00:32:09,376
You would do that?

571
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:11,860
You would leave me? You would leave us?

572
00:32:13,937 --> 00:32:14,589
No, no-no, no,

573
00:32:14,884 --> 00:32:15,750
no, no, no.

574
00:32:16,897 --> 00:32:18,743
You walk out that door, and you will live to regret it.

575
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:21,092
I will bring up this child to hate you.

576
00:32:22,311 --> 00:32:23,884
Anything you accomplish, he will undo.

577
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,751
Anything you build up, he will tear down.

578
00:32:26,972 --> 00:32:29,774
Anything you bring into this world, he will take out.

579
00:32:53,736 --> 00:32:54,716
Oh, my God.

580
00:32:59,339 --> 00:32:59,867
Sun.

581
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,560
Sun.

582
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,875
Oh, my God.

583
00:33:04,142 --> 00:33:05,951
He's talking! He's moving!

584
00:33:06,135 --> 00:33:06,508
Sun.

585
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,672
Natural sun.

586
00:33:12,568 --> 00:33:14,040
The sun! The sun woke him!

587
00:33:14,277 --> 00:33:14,975
It was bothering him.

588
00:33:15,432 --> 00:33:17,393
No. Not the light.

589
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:21,563
Uh, the son.

590
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:23,896
His child.

591
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:24,554
His son.

592
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,567
His natural son.

593
00:33:28,264 --> 00:33:31,523
Michael Rooker of Abilene, Texas is listed as the birth father to a boy

594
00:33:31,737 --> 00:33:36,202
born to Catherine Rooker, originally Catherine Naylor, in 1983.

595
00:33:37,127 --> 00:33:39,155
Turns out Isaiah Rooker was born right here in Phoenix.

596
00:33:39,925 --> 00:33:40,818
>From everything we can tell,

597
00:33:40,956 --> 00:33:43,305
he never attended a public school,
never obtained a driver's license,

598
00:33:43,545 --> 00:33:44,817
never registered for the draft,

599
00:33:45,061 --> 00:33:48,079
never received a Social Security card, a library card, a credit card,

600
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:49,187
or any other kind of card.

601
00:33:49,715 --> 00:33:50,741
For all intents and purposes,

602
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:53,664
the natural son-- the only son--

603
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:56,432
the only child to carry Michael Rooker's name

604
00:33:57,404 --> 00:33:59,017
might just as well not exist.

605
00:33:59,445 --> 00:34:00,837
Wait a second. How is that possible?

606
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:02,593
It's possible... 

607
00:34:06,365 --> 00:34:08,457
if you were brought up to do one thing--

608
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:10,828
destroy every trace of your father--

609
00:34:11,157 --> 00:34:12,981
slaughter every child he might have helped create.

610
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:15,038
Which brings us to our next problem.

611
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,404
This is the list from the FBI of every child

612
00:34:18,601 --> 00:34:20,480
they believe was born from the issue of Michael Rooker.

613
00:34:20,984 --> 00:34:22,922
There's one name left. Her name's Bella Kayne.

614
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,414
She turned 18 two days ago.

615
00:34:25,925 --> 00:34:28,528
Right now, she's in protective custody, but we can't keep her there forever.

616
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,698
Since we have no idea what this guy looks like,

617
00:34:30,926 --> 00:34:32,395
where he lives, where he works...

618
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:35,583
it's not like we can just go pick him up.

619
00:34:35,837 --> 00:34:36,916
If I knew how to identify him,

620
00:34:37,086 --> 00:34:38,519
or at least someone who could identify him,

621
00:34:38,681 --> 00:34:40,920
I'd ask this young woman to come out of hiding

622
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,010
just long enough to lure him out into the open, but...

623
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,510
since there's absolutely nobody who knows who he is

624
00:34:47,674 --> 00:34:49,087
or even what he looks like, it's...

625
00:34:51,836 --> 00:34:52,984
Mr. District Attorney,

626
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:54,778
I'm not so sure that's true.

627
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,250
Once you explained it was his natural son,

628
00:34:57,586 --> 00:34:58,808
everything just fell into place.

629
00:34:59,941 --> 00:35:02,818
That was today? That was this morning?

630
00:35:04,545 --> 00:35:05,725
I was still coming out of the fog.

631
00:35:06,186 --> 00:35:09,032
I had no recollection of that. It's like, uh...

632
00:35:10,632 --> 00:35:12,708
like I laid down for a nap in May...

633
00:35:15,658 --> 00:35:17,046
and woke up three hours ago.

634
00:35:18,476 --> 00:35:19,507
You don't remember anything?

635
00:35:24,004 --> 00:35:25,131
You know he's still out there.

636
00:35:27,352 --> 00:35:28,577
And you're the only one who's seen him.

637
00:35:29,997 --> 00:35:30,697
What do you mean?

638
00:35:30,932 --> 00:35:32,668
You're the only one who knows what he looks like.

639
00:35:33,294 --> 00:35:34,113
But I don't.

640
00:35:34,403 --> 00:35:35,273
Yeah, you do.

641
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,522
In that moment when you were dead,

642
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:40,040
in that moment when you could see everything...

643
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:42,892
I'm betting that you saw this boy.

644
00:35:44,235 --> 00:35:46,263
I'm betting that he's locked up in there somewhere.

645
00:35:47,182 --> 00:35:48,807
He's not locked anywhere.

646
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:55,071
I was in a coma. I was gone.

647
00:35:57,351 --> 00:35:59,732
Now I'm getting back.

648
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:05,461
I'm just praying I didn't lose any luggage on the trip.

649
00:36:08,807 --> 00:36:10,290
Can I help you find this killer...

650
00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:12,918
Mrs. Dubois?

651
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,114
When I'm finished here,

652
00:36:20,587 --> 00:36:22,675
I'm just hoping I can find my way home.

653
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,050
Bella Kayne works at the Sun Desert Arena.

654
00:36:28,209 --> 00:36:29,473
She has since she was 16.

655
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,874
After graduating high school last June,

656
00:36:32,381 --> 00:36:35,196
she became assistant manager in charge of arena concessions.

657
00:36:35,862 --> 00:36:38,727
She's responsible for the operations on the "F" corridor.

658
00:36:40,144 --> 00:36:41,147
During a game like today's,

659
00:36:41,356 --> 00:36:44,502
over 1,300 individuals cross through this corridor at one time or another.

660
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,229
Fully 17% of those fit the profile of our guy.

661
00:36:49,034 --> 00:36:51,877
What Miss Kayne has very bravely agreed to do is to return to work today

662
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,901
in order to help us draw Isaiah out.

663
00:36:56,121 --> 00:36:58,211
We'll have armed, plain-clothed officers from all your jurisdictions--

664
00:36:58,888 --> 00:36:59,906
city, state, and federal--

665
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,634
posing as concession workers in these eight positions.

666
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:06,177
Additionally, we're adding extra surveillance cameras to capture images

667
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:09,122
for later study should our guy show up but decide not to act.

668
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,196
But how can we be certain he'll even show?

669
00:37:12,843 --> 00:37:13,359
We can't.

670
00:37:14,284 --> 00:37:15,014
Can't be certain he'll show.

671
00:37:15,134 --> 00:37:16,854
Can't be certain if he shows, we'll know who he is.

672
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:18,548
Can't be certain of much.

673
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,918
You can say that again.

674
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,837
Everybody understand what we're looking for tonight?

675
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,834
White male, 22 years old.

676
00:37:37,149 --> 00:37:38,694
Well, now that you narrowed it down for us...

677
00:37:40,728 --> 00:37:42,540
I'm sorry. This doesn't sit right.

678
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,456
What do you mean?

679
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:45,314
He's a grabber.

680
00:37:46,835 --> 00:37:49,151
He snatches them, and he takes them away and cuts their hearts out.

681
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:53,587
How the hell is he gonna do that here in front of hundreds of people?

682
00:37:54,403 --> 00:37:56,065
Is that chick from the mayor's office with you right now?

683
00:37:58,095 --> 00:37:58,855
Chick here.

684
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:04,196
Sorry. Just wondering if you were able to run that little errand we discussed?

685
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:05,897
Leaking the girl's home address to the press?

686
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:07,502
Yeah, about 45 minutes ago.

687
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,002
Good. Keep them out of our hair,

688
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:11,765
just in case our killer was still hoping to grab her at home.

689
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,680
Maybe it'll encourage him to come visit her at work instead.

690
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:19,422
Hey.
Do you actually know all those guys out there?

691
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:22,472
I see a lot of unfamiliar faces out there.

692
00:38:23,828 --> 00:38:26,763
Makes me a little nervous being surrounded by so many strangers with guns.

693
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,993
I know.
I don't know half of them.

694
00:38:29,213 --> 00:38:30,815
We got some state guys, couple of feds.

695
00:38:32,332 --> 00:38:33,352
How's Captain Push doing?

696
00:38:34,482 --> 00:38:36,722
Thirsty. Skeptical.

697
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:42,092
Eyes up, people.

698
00:38:43,595 --> 00:38:44,271
Lee, what's going on in there?:

699
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:45,700
We may have a live one.

700
00:38:47,364 --> 00:38:49,718
Allison, does anyone over there have any feelings about what we're looking at?

701
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:51,200
Does he look familiar?

702
00:38:55,862 --> 00:38:57,439
Hmm. Reminds me of my Uncle Ned.

703
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:07,103
Everybody, relax. It's nothing.

704
00:39:11,407 --> 00:39:12,046
That's the game!

705
00:39:27,346 --> 00:39:27,770
Great game.

706
00:39:28,172 --> 00:39:28,641
Yeah, who played?

707
00:39:30,392 --> 00:39:30,849
What do we do now?

708
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:34,520
Well, I guess we need to get this young lady back into protective custody.

709
00:39:36,737 --> 00:39:38,688
Miss Kayne, I'm sorry tonight was all for naught,

710
00:39:39,189 --> 00:39:42,299
but that doesn't change the fact that what you did here was very, very brave.

711
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:44,321
Will you bring the car around for Miss Kayne

712
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:46,136
and get an escort up to the F Level.

713
00:39:46,397 --> 00:39:49,690
So... what does this mean-- "back to protective custody"?

714
00:39:50,073 --> 00:39:50,854
Back to the hotel?

715
00:39:51,273 --> 00:39:51,834
I'm afraid so.

716
00:39:52,897 --> 00:39:54,247
When is it that you're scheduled to work next?

717
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:57,657
Um, there's a game two nights from now.

718
00:39:58,516 --> 00:39:58,909
Cool.

719
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:01,490
$5.15 an hour, all the pop I can drink--

720
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:03,710
- I'll be here. 
- You can count me in, too.

721
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,319
Excuse me.

722
00:40:07,419 --> 00:40:09,328
We've got a car waiting for Miss Kayne down below.

723
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,465
We'll talk tomorrow...

724
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:14,189
Pleasure to meet you.

725
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:22,551
Officer.

726
00:40:25,777 --> 00:40:27,637
Hey! Officer!

727
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:29,759
Captain Push?

728
00:40:30,339 --> 00:40:31,146
Hey! Isaiah!

729
00:40:43,631 --> 00:40:44,460
We got an officer down.

730
00:40:46,681 --> 00:40:47,437
Are you all right?

731
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:48,230
Never better.

732
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,964
Never better.

733
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:53,527
You knew. You knew 'cause you saw him.

734
00:40:54,622 --> 00:40:55,878
You knew exactly what he looked like...

735
00:40:56,598 --> 00:40:58,274
- No.|- ...cause you saw him when you cut those wires.

736
00:40:58,513 --> 00:41:00,285
No, I knew because,

737
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:04,014
unlike the rest of you up there at five or six feet,

738
00:41:04,784 --> 00:41:05,390
I'm down here,

739
00:41:05,745 --> 00:41:07,905
and I just happened to notice he was wearing

740
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:10,693
a pair of high-top sneakers under that uniform.

741
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,719
And as he was walking away, I started thinking,

742
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:22,030
"What sort of peace officer wears high-top sneakers?"

743
00:41:22,725 --> 00:41:25,437
And that was all I was gonna ask him the first two times I called to him.

744
00:41:29,277 --> 00:41:32,918
Sorry. Had nothing to do with dying.

745
00:41:34,744 --> 00:41:38,728
Just an old law man doing his old law man thing.

746
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:48,724
I think you're back, Captain Push.

747
00:41:49,992 --> 00:41:53,485
And I do believe all your luggage made the trip just fine.

748
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,313
- Hey.|- Hey.

749
00:42:06,783 --> 00:42:07,665
Any dreams?

750
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,573
Mm-hmm.

751
00:42:11,289 --> 00:42:12,229
Yeah, me, too.

752
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:15,771
So you ready for what's next?

753
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:19,659
Mm.

754
00:42:20,235 --> 00:42:21,851
Yeah, me, too.

755
00:42:22,812 --> 00:42:24,946
