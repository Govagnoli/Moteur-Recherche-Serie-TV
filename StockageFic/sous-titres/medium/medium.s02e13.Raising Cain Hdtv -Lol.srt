1
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,429
Does this young fellow look familiar?

2
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,335
He ought to.

3
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:28,261
The sad truth is there are boys like him all across our nation.

4
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:31,308
They're the ones who just can't seem to fit in.

5
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:35,303
There could be a boy just like him living in your town.

6
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:38,879
Right on your block, even going to your school.

7
00:00:40,143 --> 00:00:42,191
You might not even be aware of it.

8
00:00:42,512 --> 00:00:44,060
Would you know what to look for?

9
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:48,083
Would you know how to spot "the outsider"?

10
00:00:51,015 --> 00:00:54,496
The outsider may have stopped applying himself in class.

11
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:57,653
He's probably given up trying to make friends.

12
00:00:59,863 --> 00:01:04,862
Rightly or wrongly, the outsider has come to feel that everyone is against him.

13
00:01:07,687 --> 00:01:11,328
On the surface, he looks much like any other boy on the block.

14
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,709
But inside, the outsider is eaten away with resentment

15
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,812
and a desperate urge to get even.

16
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:27,373
If enough of these feelings accumulate,

17
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:30,084
he may be tempted to act out.

18
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,276
Acting out can take many forms--

19
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:38,253
antisocial behavior, rejection of one's peers...

20
00:01:44,197 --> 00:01:46,061
...even, in extreme cases...

21
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,143
Mommy.

22
00:01:48,297 --> 00:01:49,050
..mouthing off

23
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:50,509
to authority figures.

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,774
Mommy.

25
00:01:58,316 --> 00:01:59,403
What's going on?

26
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:01,484
Did you have a bad dream?

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,445
Mommy...

28
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:13,064
Oh, my goodness. This is a bad dream.

29
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:01,231
I'm just saying that, you know,

30
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:02,828
she got out once, she'll do it again.

31
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,935
We don't know that.

32
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:05,056
I think I overslept.

33
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:05,808
Morning, sweetie.

34
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:07,888
Morning, Mommy. Morning, Daddy.

35
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,064
No, but we've been to this picnic a couple times before.

36
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:12,962
You know, history would seem to suggest

37
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:15,476
that once they figure out how to get over that wall,

38
00:03:15,526 --> 00:03:16,618
then that's that.

39
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:18,544
What are you guys talking about?

40
00:03:18,638 --> 00:03:19,238
Nothing.

41
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:21,540
You know what, I'll just go to the store

42
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:23,261
and get some kind of safety bars or something.

43
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:25,474
I don't know, I think maybe we should just bite the bullet

44
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:27,043
and buy Houdini here a big-girl bed.

45
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:28,979
I think she's ready.

46
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:31,060
How about it, sweetheart? Huh?

47
00:03:31,706 --> 00:03:32,600
You want a big-girl bed?

48
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:34,529
Well, wait a second.

49
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,967
Why can't she just take my bed?

50
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,114
I could move into her room.

51
00:03:39,322 --> 00:03:40,771
I'm almost 13.

52
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,752
I'm old enough to have my own room.

53
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:46,839
Well, this is a conversation we should have when we have more time

54
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:49,703
because everybody's got to get ready for work, for school.

55
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:51,822
But why? It's simple.

56
00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:55,473
Marie can move in with Bridgette and I can take her room.

57
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:58,115
Wait a second, what about me? What do I get?

58
00:03:58,277 --> 00:04:00,665
You get the top bunk.

59
00:04:22,023 --> 00:04:22,942
What do I owe the pleasure?

60
00:04:23,454 --> 00:04:24,208
Is this a bad time?

61
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,620
Not for me.

62
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,495
Those two ar some kind of hell.

63
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:31,262
It's good, they need a minute alone.

64
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,124
What's up?

65
00:04:32,175 --> 00:04:34,846
You ever heard of a high school called Claymore?

66
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,881
Could be a private school, definitely co-ed.

67
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:39,446
Not off the top of my head. Why?

68
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:41,645
I don't know, I just, I had this strange...

69
00:04:42,164 --> 00:04:45,483
- A hunch.
- You could say that.

70
00:04:46,098 --> 00:04:48,268
Anyway, I forgot about it and then something told me

71
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,208
this morning that I should come by here,

72
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:52,153
run it by you, that you might be able to shed some light.

73
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:56,353
Not me. No light here. Not a flicker.

74
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:59,512
But I'd be happy to find any Claymore Highs if they're out there.

75
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:02,181
Right now I got to get back and, uh...

76
00:05:04,516 --> 00:05:05,795
Unless you want to return the favor.

77
00:05:06,283 --> 00:05:07,180
What do you mean?

78
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:11,968
They woke up this morning, their seven-year-old was gone.

79
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:14,178
Window lock was forced open, but there's no ransom note.

80
00:05:15,344 --> 00:05:16,570
I was about to run out there.

81
00:05:17,552 --> 00:05:18,863
Wouldn't mind another set of eyes.

82
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:33,046
Tyler's room is right down here.

83
00:05:40,045 --> 00:05:41,122
Sorry it's such a mess.

84
00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:43,423
They, uh, asked us not to touch anything.

85
00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:45,571
That's all right, Mr. Downey.

86
00:05:47,812 --> 00:05:49,232
Were any of your son's things taken?

87
00:05:49,987 --> 00:05:52,758
No. I... I don't think so.

88
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:54,708
Would you like me to ask my wife?

89
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,632
She would know better than me.

90
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,161
Oh, no, that's okay.

91
00:05:58,147 --> 00:06:00,405
We'll, uh, we'll just be here a few minutes.

92
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:02,915
We thought about putting up bars.

93
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,845
You know, those... window guards?

94
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:17,153
Some people in the neighborhood have them, some don't.

95
00:06:18,585 --> 00:06:21,138
When we bought this place,

96
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:24,218
Paul and I researched how much it would cost to put them on.

97
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,220
But  I hated the way they looked.

98
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:53,826
That number there will get you directly to me 24 hours a day.

99
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,105
We're also monitoring your phone.

100
00:06:57,443 --> 00:07:00,513
And I'd like to keep a detective in your home for a day or so in case we do...

101
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:02,852
find a note or get a call.

102
00:07:10,103 --> 00:07:12,303
Do you know how many dump sites there are within 50 miles?

103
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:14,451
Um... a lot?

104
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:15,854
More than a lot.

105
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:17,525
They wouldn't even give me a number.

106
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:21,405
Do you know how many bloodhounds are at the city's disposal?

107
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,679
- Um, not a lot?
- Six.

108
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,056
Well, Allison, it's a start.

109
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,310
You may not have found the needle, but at least you found the haystack.

110
00:07:31,987 --> 00:07:32,933
I'm not so sure.

111
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:35,504
Maybe his body hasn't been dumped yet.

112
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,154
How do I even know what I saw has happened already?

113
00:07:42,402 --> 00:07:45,934
I  forgot to go to the store and get what I needed for Marie's crib.

114
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:48,406
Oh, good.

115
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:54,450
I've decided to join the Let's Give Ariel Her Own Room campaign.

116
00:07:57,614 --> 00:07:59,336
- Really?
- Yeah.

117
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:03,829
guhe's going to need a place to stew once she figures out she hates us.

118
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:08,035
- Think so, huh?
- I do, too.

119
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:14,125
Okay, well, great.

120
00:08:15,382 --> 00:08:19,116
Let's swing by the fuure store tomorrow and pick up a bed.

121
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,592
If I get home from work early enough,

122
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:24,466
maybe I can even take apart the c

123
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:27,380
Call my sister, she if she wants to pick it up.

124
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,713
Why do we have to get rid of it?

125
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:32,312
Why can't we just... put it in garage?

126
00:08:34,036 --> 00:08:34,842
As what?

127
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:37,297
A shrine to our child-bearing years?

128
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:31,693
How is he?
Is he going to be all right?

129
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:33,184
They think he'll get there.

130
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:35,860
Apparently, somebody drugged him, shot him and drove him to that dump site.

131
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:38,259
Oh, my God, and he survived.

132
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,456
The bullet glanced off the skull without penetrating.

133
00:09:40,507 --> 00:09:42,707
It happens sometimes with small caliber weapons.

134
00:09:43,402 --> 00:09:44,487
Leaves a hell of an ugly wound,

135
00:09:44,538 --> 00:09:46,438
but it doesn't actually reach the gray matter.

136
00:09:47,344 --> 00:09:48,530
Hopefully, when he wakes up,

137
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:50,078
he'll be able to describe the guy who took him.

138
00:09:50,562 --> 00:09:51,442
How soon will that be?

139
00:09:51,802 --> 00:09:54,297
Couple hours. Come on.
The doctors are going. Let's go.

140
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,110
Hi.

141
00:10:05,663 --> 00:10:08,432
I think we're both still in a state of shock, you know?

142
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,793
I mean... happy shock, but still shock.

143
00:10:12,097 --> 00:10:13,974
It's a miracle. It's nothing less than a miracle.

144
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:16,733
And a lot of solid police work, I'm sure.

145
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:18,782
We're both incredibly grateful.

146
00:10:21,197 --> 00:10:23,848
Oh, you know, there are some friends of ours from the parish.

147
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:25,661
Can you just excuse us for just a moment?

148
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:26,766
Oh, no problem.

149
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,445
Excuse me.

150
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:33,029
I should step outside.
I got a couple calls to make.

151
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:34,807
Okay. Um...

152
00:10:35,116 --> 00:10:36,762
I'll just stay here in case he wakes up.

153
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:38,354
Okay.

154
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:33,054
Tyler. Tyler.

155
00:11:33,547 --> 00:11:34,387
Are you awake?

156
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,159
Is this hell?

157
00:11:44,127 --> 00:11:45,025
You're in a hospital.

158
00:11:45,076 --> 00:11:46,871
You were hurt, but you're gonna be okay.

159
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,045
You swear this isn't hell?

160
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:58,586
Absolutely, I swear.

161
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:01,456
But why would you think that?

162
00:12:03,992 --> 00:12:07,374
Because I'm bad. That's where the bad kids go.

163
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:09,319
Tyler?

164
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:13,286
My God! Hey! Hey, you're awake?

165
00:12:13,447 --> 00:12:14,773
Hey, hi.

166
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:22,994
The closet might be a bit of a problem.

167
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:24,619
I'm gonna have a lot of my own stuff,

168
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,481
so  maybe we can get, like, uh, three more shelves.

169
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,102
Just three shelves?

170
00:12:31,155 --> 00:12:34,999
Hi, Mom! I love this room so much.

171
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:36,173
I'm glad, sweetie.

172
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:38,096
You're going to knock, right?

173
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:41,222
'Cause I mean, the new rule, right, privacy?

174
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:46,133
Do you remember when Saturday used to be our day?

175
00:12:46,647 --> 00:12:47,817
Vaguely.

176
00:12:48,072 --> 00:12:49,686
Mommy!

177
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:53,122
I don't know.

178
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:56,891
It still feels sort of... empty.

179
00:12:59,703 --> 00:13:02,290
Can we go to the furniture store tomorrow and get some furniture?

180
00:13:02,404 --> 00:13:04,561
Maybe a lava lamp and some beanbag chairs?

181
00:13:04,988 --> 00:13:07,255
Hey, you know, if you're really so desperate for furniture

182
00:13:07,306 --> 00:13:09,251
maybe I could put that crib back together again.

183
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:10,290
That's not funny, Daddy.

184
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:11,472
That's not funny, Daddy.

185
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,376
Yeah, well, we still got to figure out what to do with it,

186
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:14,431
so what do you say?

187
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:16,932
We give it to the thrift store or we call my sister?

188
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:18,826
Do we really have to decide right now?

189
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:22,640
I just didn't think it was that big of a question.

190
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:25,211
I just want a little time, okay?

191
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:34,153
It's funny.
I thought you'd be in a better mood,

192
00:13:35,043 --> 00:13:37,299
what with saving a child's life and all.

193
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:40,565
I'm in a fine mood.

194
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:48,768
He said the damndest thing to me when he first woke up

195
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:51,083
and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.

196
00:13:58,725 --> 00:14:00,346
He asked me if he was in hell.

197
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:06,280
Well, in the kid's defense, he did have a pretty lousy day.

198
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,813
No, that's not what he meant.

199
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,780
He thought he was actually in hell.

200
00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:17,526
That he had died and been sent somewhere to be punished because...

201
00:14:19,363 --> 00:14:21,068
he was a bad person.

202
00:14:23,687 --> 00:14:26,007
And I know how this is going to sound, but...

203
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,073
I got the distinct impression that he thought he deserved it.

204
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:35,472
That that's where he was supposed to be.

205
00:14:38,822 --> 00:14:40,263
And I can't help but wonder...

206
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:48,198
how does a terrible thought like that get into a little boy's head?

207
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,940
You belong to your father the devil

208
00:15:24,454 --> 00:15:26,950
and you want to carry out your father's desire.

209
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:29,542
He was a murderer from the beginning,

210
00:15:29,593 --> 00:15:32,777
not holding to the truth for there is no truth in him.

211
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:36,661
And when he lies, he speaks his native language

212
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:40,420
for he is a liar and the father of lies.

213
00:15:56,912 --> 00:15:59,018
Thank you for coming in on a Sunday, Mr. and Mrs. Downey.

214
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:00,120
No, anything to help.

215
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,208
How long is this going to take?

216
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:04,058
Our son's asleep and we'd like to be back at his bedside when he wakes up.

217
00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:05,445
We just need to ask a few questions.

218
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:06,985
Hopefully, rule a few things out.

219
00:16:13,844 --> 00:16:15,086
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Downey.

220
00:16:16,426 --> 00:16:19,487
Detective. Ah, I'm sorry.

221
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:21,885
Allison. Allison Dubois.

222
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:25,886
How's  Tyler doing?

223
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:27,438
He's much better, thank you.

224
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,303
He's awake for long stretches.

225
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:32,063
Even asked for his crayons this morning.

226
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:33,373
Mr. and Mrs. Downey,

227
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:36,022
as part of our investigation into your son's abduction,

228
00:16:36,073 --> 00:16:37,994
our lab conducted a toxin screen,

229
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:40,137
an analysis of your son's blood.

230
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:41,538
Okay.

231
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:46,001
And test results seem to indicate that on the night your son was taken,

232
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:50,211
he  was given a massive dose of a prescription sleep aid.

233
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:51,529
What?

234
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:52,866
No, no, it's important.

235
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:54,314
It's important that we hear all this.

236
00:16:54,676 --> 00:16:58,229
Just out of curiosity, do either of you use sleeping pills?

237
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:06,233
I'm sorry, did I miss some...?

238
00:17:06,616 --> 00:17:08,140
Are you asking if my wife and I...?

239
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:10,892
That is what you're asking, isn't it?

240
00:17:10,943 --> 00:17:12,546
Please, don't be offended.

241
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:14,049
In any abduction case,

242
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,125
it's routine to eliminate those closest to the child first.

243
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,938
Mrs. Downey?

244
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,407
Yes, I do, actually.

245
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,297
I have two prescriptions at the moment.

246
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:27,876
Would one of them be Zolpidem?

247
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:33,233
I have no idea. I don't really know the names.

248
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:36,799
I just sort of hand the slips of paper over to the pharmacist.

249
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,610
Of course. You'll check for us?

250
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:39,553
Oh, sure.

251
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,260
How about you, Mr. Downey,? Ever take sleeping pills?

252
00:17:44,455 --> 00:17:45,799
I'll take one of Marilyn's occasionally.

253
00:17:46,435 --> 00:17:49,976
Not often. Rarely.

254
00:17:51,957 --> 00:17:53,112
Is this really necessary?

255
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:54,670
Uh, according to your statement,

256
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,957
you said that the night your son was abducted,

257
00:17:58,033 --> 00:17:59,970
you slept through the night.
Is that correct?

258
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:01,951
Yes, obviously.

259
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:04,242
You don't remember hearing anything?

260
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,545
Not even when Tyler's window was being pried open with a crowbar?

261
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:10,445
Isn't all this in my statement?

262
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:13,508
Would you be willing to allow us to draw a sample of your blood?

263
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:17,068
It'd have to be within the next several hours to actually tell us anything.

264
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:22,684
I mean, if what we're trying to do is, uh... eliminate possibilities.

265
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:23,911
What possibilities?

266
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:26,079
Why do you need to test my blood?

267
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:29,204
To see if there's any of my prescription in there, Paul.

268
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:31,014
Isn't that right, Detective?

269
00:18:33,393 --> 00:18:35,451
Mr. District Attorney?

270
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:37,794
You folks serious?

271
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:40,823
I mean, do you really think that my wife would hurt our son?

272
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,957
No one is making any formal accusations against anyone.

273
00:18:46,064 --> 00:18:50,955
Again, we're simply asking for a sample of your blood in the hopes of eliminating...

274
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,528
Well, you can't have any blood.

275
00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:56,601
This is insane and it's hurtful.

276
00:18:57,844 --> 00:19:02,040
You mean to say, if I happened to have taken a sleeping pill that night...

277
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:04,596
What kind of request is that?

278
00:19:04,647 --> 00:19:06,070
What kind of a theory is that?

279
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:07,114
We don't mean to offend you.

280
00:19:07,165 --> 00:19:08,803
We're simply hoping for your cooperation, sir.

281
00:19:08,968 --> 00:19:09,990
My cooperation?

282
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:14,689
Why? So you can put off looking for the real maniac who took my son?

283
00:19:15,512 --> 00:19:17,218
No, I'm not doing it.

284
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,911
I'm not going to give you an excuse not to stop

285
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:22,560
that animal before he has a chance to strike again.

286
00:19:23,468 --> 00:19:25,063
And I want you to apologize to my wife.

287
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,535
It doesn't matter.

288
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:36,496
Okay, fine. Don't.

289
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:42,415
You call us away from our son's sickbed to level these absurd accusations at us?

290
00:19:44,222 --> 00:19:45,359
Shame on all of you.

291
00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:48,586
Come on, Marilyn.
I think we need to find an attorney.

292
00:19:51,977 --> 00:19:54,440
You belong to your father the devil.

293
00:19:56,157 --> 00:19:58,303
And you want to carry out your father's desire.

294
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:02,982
What did you say?

295
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:09,520
It's from the Book of John. Does that ring a bell?

296
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:14,009
Marilyn, come on.

297
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:30,662
Pardon me.

298
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,788
I've been waiting for the District Attorney, but I guess you'll do.

299
00:20:36,591 --> 00:20:39,980
I just came from the hospital. What have you people told them?

300
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:44,103
Why won't they let me see my son, take him home?

301
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:49,073
What, you have no answer for that?

302
00:20:50,511 --> 00:20:51,609
Why am I surprised?

303
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:53,565
You plucked that scripture out of my head.

304
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:56,721
I knew right then who you were, who you worked for.

305
00:20:57,437 --> 00:20:59,748
I work for  the District Attorney.

306
00:21:00,196 --> 00:21:06,372
And he finds it, we all find it extremely peculiar that

307
00:21:06,423 --> 00:21:08,147
you and your husband don't want to cooperate,

308
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:10,467
don't want to help us get to the bottom of this.

309
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:14,628
You are his parents, he is your child.

310
00:21:15,262 --> 00:21:19,899
You people don't know anything about me or my child.

311
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,186
No, I think we do.

312
00:21:21,554 --> 00:21:24,520
Really? How well do you know evil?

313
00:21:25,821 --> 00:21:28,050
I know it when I see it. Do you?

314
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,933
Do you know how it works? Do you know how it grows?

315
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:36,209
If you carried it inside you, if you took it to your breast,

316
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,459
lived with it every day, had it inside your house...

317
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,437
You are talking about a child.

318
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:43,005
My child.

319
00:21:44,228 --> 00:21:47,620
And keeping me from him is a mistake, Mrs. Dubois.

320
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:50,085
I need to bring him home.

321
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:53,951
And if you truly understood that piece of scripture you quoted,

322
00:21:54,885 --> 00:21:56,668
you would recognize the truth of that.

323
00:21:56,966 --> 00:22:00,177
I recognize that you are someone in the midst of a crisis,

324
00:22:00,457 --> 00:22:04,036
that you need help, that the evil you think is inside your son

325
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:06,808
is actually inside your head.

326
00:22:07,116 --> 00:22:08,733
And until I am convinced otherwise,

327
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:12,980
I will do everything I can to be sure that you are nowhere near Tyler.

328
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:40,235
What's terrifying-- no, what's tragic--

329
00:22:40,286 --> 00:22:45,211
her sense of conviction is so strong, it's... so absolute.

330
00:22:47,656 --> 00:22:51,463
I keep thinking about all these couples who are desperate to have a child of their own,

331
00:22:51,514 --> 00:22:52,584
and here's this woman...

332
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:58,938
completely convinced that her son must die, that he's the embodiment of evil.

333
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:00,832
It makes me want to cry.

334
00:23:03,984 --> 00:23:05,692
So what happens now?

335
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:12,180
I don't know, we can only compel the hospital to keep him in protective custody for so long.

336
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:16,879
The father is blind to it all.

337
00:23:17,704 --> 00:23:19,397
I don't know what we can prove in court.

338
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:25,967
All I know is, I have to do everything I can to keep that woman away from her son.

339
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:33,168
How old did you say he was?

340
00:23:36,154 --> 00:23:40,617
I don't know, he's, like... six or seven, maybe.

341
00:23:42,514 --> 00:23:46,877
Sweet. God, he seemed so sweet.

342
00:23:48,322 --> 00:23:51,171
Tyler. His name's Tyler.

343
00:23:52,918 --> 00:23:54,118
Tyler.

344
00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:22,225
In situations like this one, it's useful to ask oneself...

345
00:24:24,802 --> 00:24:27,432
...would you know how to spot  the seeds of resentment

346
00:24:27,638 --> 00:24:31,192
before they blossom into the rotten fruit of bad behavior?

347
00:24:35,435 --> 00:24:37,467
Tyler, don't. Tyler, please,

348
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,176
why-why are you doing this?

349
00:24:41,108 --> 00:24:44,594
I don't know. Because I'm mad.

350
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:50,664
Tyler.

351
00:24:54,935 --> 00:24:56,243
He killed them all, Joe.

352
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,011
He was so unrepentant.

353
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:02,161
It was like all the sweetness, all the innocence I saw in him,

354
00:25:02,212 --> 00:25:04,018
it was just... gone.

355
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:08,246
Is what I'm saying making any kind of sense to you?

356
00:25:08,953 --> 00:25:10,539
Uh, I don't know, maybe.

357
00:25:11,222 --> 00:25:15,646
It's 2:45 in the morning-- nothing much makes sense to me at 2:45 in the morning.

358
00:25:16,534 --> 00:25:17,690
Well, forget it.

359
00:25:17,993 --> 00:25:20,932
I'm sorry, it was selfish of me to wake you.

360
00:25:21,141 --> 00:25:22,851
No, no, I'm sorry, all right?

361
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:24,398
Let me just try and focus.

362
00:25:25,095 --> 00:25:26,495
Why don't you start from the beginning.

363
00:25:27,117 --> 00:25:33,373
Yesterday... I dreamt that Marilyn Downey was shooting her son in the head.

364
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:35,056
Now today, I'm dreaming about Tyler,

365
00:25:35,107 --> 00:25:39,238
and he's in high school, and he's killing people, dozens of them.

366
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:41,985
He took out a gun, and he was just slaughtering them.

367
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,332
I-In the future?

368
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:45,840
In the future.

369
00:25:50,053 --> 00:25:52,181
Well, maybe this kid's supposed to be a long-term project.

370
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,852
Maybe you're supposed to help him out even after you lock his mother up.

371
00:25:58,632 --> 00:26:00,927
Or maybe I'm not supposed to help him at all.

372
00:26:04,494 --> 00:26:05,787
You can't be serious.

373
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,190
I don't know.

374
00:26:09,226 --> 00:26:11,385
Maybe his mother has a touch of what I have.

375
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,733
Maybe she's seen what I just saw.

376
00:26:14,566 --> 00:26:16,919
I mean, then it would make some kind of crazy sense.

377
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,122
Then you could almost understand why she would do it,

378
00:26:20,173 --> 00:26:22,350
why  she would feel compelled to try again.

379
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:25,595
Maybe I'm not supposed to stop her.

380
00:26:26,576 --> 00:26:27,867
Maybe she's just crazy.

381
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,044
Maybe what you're seeing when you dream are the dreams of a crazy woman.

382
00:26:32,168 --> 00:26:33,687
Maybe, but how do I know?

383
00:26:34,282 --> 00:26:35,561
How can I be sure?

384
00:26:35,674 --> 00:26:37,268
I don't want to do the wrong thing.

385
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,032
I don't want to make the wrong decision.

386
00:26:39,258 --> 00:26:40,356
The wrong decision?

387
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,041
Allison, you're not seriously suggesting

388
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:46,943
that sending this kid home with his homicidal mother is an option, are you?

389
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,363
I'm not suggesting anything. I'm just trying to figure it out.

390
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,141
But there's nothing to figure out.

391
00:26:52,322 --> 00:26:54,582
This kid is in danger.

392
00:26:55,143 --> 00:26:57,820
He's seven years old, and he needs your help.

393
00:26:58,152 --> 00:26:59,505
That's all you need to know.

394
00:27:02,853 --> 00:27:13,228
Of course. You're right. You're right.

395
00:27:17,765 --> 00:27:19,209
Glad to be of assistance.

396
00:27:21,793 --> 00:27:27,459
Joe Dubois: husband, father, moral compass. We never close.

397
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:07,986
You have a moment, sir?

398
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:10,592
Allison. Sure. Come in.

399
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:15,764
Hypothetically, what would you say

400
00:28:15,815 --> 00:28:19,851
if I told you I came across a piece of evidence that might help us

401
00:28:19,902 --> 00:28:22,495
nail Marilyn Downey for the attempted murder of her son?

402
00:28:25,715 --> 00:28:28,241
Hypothetically, I'd tell you that I'm a very happy man.

403
00:28:28,634 --> 00:28:32,618
What would you say if I told youI'd been having dreams about the little boy we're trying to save?

404
00:28:33,735 --> 00:28:37,390
What if I told you that he may grow up to become one of the most evil human beings

405
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,938
you or I have ever known,

406
00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:42,467
and that by stopping his mother from committing an atrocity in the present,

407
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:47,416
we may very well be setting the stage for an even greater atrocity in the future?

408
00:28:48,863 --> 00:28:50,339
What would you say then?

409
00:28:58,658 --> 00:29:02,911
I'd tell you that you're giving me more information than I need to do my job.

410
00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:08,684
I'd tell you that we have a responsibility to take care of the case that's right in front of us:

411
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:10,942
saving this child from his very deranged parent.

412
00:29:11,463 --> 00:29:13,492
What if this child grows up to hurt other children?

413
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:15,509
What if he becomes a killer?

414
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,949
I'd remind you that we have almost a decade to try and stop him.

415
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:24,763
Let's first worry about protecting Tyler Downey from his mother.

416
00:29:25,173 --> 00:29:27,736
Then we'll figure out a way to protect society from Tyler Downey.

417
00:29:44,734 --> 00:29:47,702
- Tell me!
- Tell you what?

418
00:29:48,012 --> 00:29:50,737
Tell me how high you're gonna put that sign on the door.

419
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:53,424
And I asked you, how tall are you?

420
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:59,290
Mom! Tell her she can't keep me out of her room just because I'm littler than she is!

421
00:30:00,126 --> 00:30:02,923
There are no height requirements in the Dubois house, Ariel.

422
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,030
I'm still putting it on my door.

423
00:30:18,314 --> 00:30:19,196
Hello?

424
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:20,490
It's me, Allison.

425
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:22,644
Just wanted to let you know that I heard from forensics.

426
00:30:22,974 --> 00:30:23,661
And?

427
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,732
While the gun you found was unmistakably the one used to shoot Tyler Downey,

428
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:29,187
it's never been registered,

429
00:30:29,717 --> 00:30:32,800
and was thoroughly cleaned before it was left at that dump site.

430
00:30:33,486 --> 00:30:37,037
There simply are no prints or DNA evidence.

431
00:30:37,562 --> 00:30:39,763
So there's no way to trace it back to Marilyn.

432
00:30:40,544 --> 00:30:41,986
I'm afraid that's not the worst of it.

433
00:30:44,098 --> 00:30:45,603
The Downeys went back to court this morning,

434
00:30:45,673 --> 00:30:48,848
and the judge ruled that as soon as Tyler is feeling up to it,

435
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:51,083
he's to be released into his parents' care.

436
00:30:52,877 --> 00:30:55,669
They left the hospital together at 5:20 this afternoon.

437
00:30:57,556 --> 00:31:01,087
So how long do you think it'll be till we get the call that she finally killed him?

438
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:07,563
Allison, I think we've made it abundantly clear to Mrs. Downey that we're watching her,

439
00:31:07,614 --> 00:31:09,108
that we'll always be watching her.

440
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,447
Well, that's fine and good, sir...

441
00:31:11,968 --> 00:31:12,788
But?

442
00:31:12,949 --> 00:31:15,234
I just don't know how much that means to a crazy person.

443
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:36,027
Where do the leaders of tomorrow come from?

444
00:31:36,435 --> 00:31:43,034
The seeds of their success are sown here in the halls of high schools all across American.

445
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:47,943
Let's listen in on one such success story.

446
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:56,242
And before we award you your diplomas, let's hear a word from our valedictorian, Tyler Downey.

447
00:32:12,446 --> 00:32:17,344
In the days leading up to graduation, a number of people have asked me:

448
00:32:17,723 --> 00:32:24,442
"Is there one person or one event that has inspired you through your high school career?"

449
00:32:25,815 --> 00:32:30,141
For me, the person who made the biggest difference was my mom.

450
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:36,941
- Wow.
- Hmm?

451
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,722
- You okay?
- Yeah.

452
00:32:43,321 --> 00:32:49,117
Actually I am okay. And I think everything's gonna be okay.

453
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:01,643
I didn't... Good morning.

454
00:33:01,694 --> 00:33:02,648
I didn't mean to frighten you.

455
00:33:02,699 --> 00:33:05,698
I was just wondering if... if I could have a word.

456
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:09,066
"A word"? Talk?

457
00:33:09,757 --> 00:33:11,047
Is that really necessary?

458
00:33:11,803 --> 00:33:13,644
Isn't a talk really beside the point?

459
00:33:13,822 --> 00:33:14,915
I don't think so.

460
00:33:16,142 --> 00:33:18,104
For one thing, I am not who you think I am.

461
00:33:18,155 --> 00:33:22,049
In fact, I am probably much more like you than you think.

462
00:33:23,193 --> 00:33:24,425
What do you mean?

463
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:32,566
You have had dreams about Tyler.  About his future. So have I.

464
00:33:35,406 --> 00:33:38,034
- I don't believe you.
- It's true.

465
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:40,922
That's how I knew about you, about the dump.

466
00:33:40,973 --> 00:33:44,574
That's how I knew about the Scripture that you quoted, right before you shot him.

467
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:49,341
John. Chapter eight. Verse 44. I dreamt it.

468
00:33:50,774 --> 00:33:53,560
I dreamt the other dreams thatyou had about Tyler growing up,

469
00:33:53,611 --> 00:33:56,829
about high school... about the killings.

470
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:06,133
I came here... this morning, to tell you your dreams are wrong.

471
00:34:06,903 --> 00:34:09,017
Tyler doesn't have to grow up to be a killer.

472
00:34:09,068 --> 00:34:13,329
He can be a... an incredible boy, an incredible man.

473
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:18,451
The key... is you.

474
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,685
You are the one that makes it possible.

475
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:24,606
I have seen it.

476
00:34:28,343 --> 00:34:31,856
No No.

477
00:34:33,187 --> 00:34:38,368
I know what I know. I know what I feel.

478
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:40,305
This is a trick.

479
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:43,842
You are a demon, and this is a trick.

480
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:50,465
No, I am no demon. And there is no trick.

481
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,193
This is a miracle.

482
00:34:55,565 --> 00:34:59,990
This is a second chance, and they come very rarely.

483
00:35:01,714 --> 00:35:04,242
Look. I know what you did in that dump.

484
00:35:04,957 --> 00:35:06,083
But you know what?

485
00:35:06,377 --> 00:35:10,022
No one else does. No one else in the whole wide world.

486
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:13,880
Most especially, not your son.

487
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:19,275
Just you, me and God.

488
00:35:21,868 --> 00:35:28,783
So I guess why I was sent here, why I'm here is to tell you none of it matters.

489
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:36,184
It can all be wiped away right here, right now,

490
00:35:37,616 --> 00:35:41,336
if you choose it, if you believe it,

491
00:35:42,689 --> 00:35:46,207
if you can see Tyler for the incredible boy he really is.

492
00:35:53,749 --> 00:35:59,154
Oh... Oh, my God.

493
00:36:00,446 --> 00:36:02,478
You're an angel, aren't you?

494
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:04,740
No.

495
00:36:06,194 --> 00:36:15,057
I'm just a woman who knows about something horrible and who is willing to forget about it.

496
00:36:18,627 --> 00:36:20,062
If you're willing.

497
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:37,922
She looks awfully comfortable, doesn't she?

498
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:44,562
House is all locked up.

499
00:36:46,836 --> 00:36:48,890
Ariel finally turned her light out.

500
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,556
It's like she's slept there her whole life.

501
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,292
Well, I guess she was getting a little big for that crib, wasn't she?

502
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,050
Maybe just a hair.

503
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,390
You ready for bed?

504
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:13,793
We're lucky, aren't we?

505
00:37:15,457 --> 00:37:18,674
Three amazing kids. We did all right.

506
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:24,813
"Did"? As in past tense? Hmm? As in we're done?

507
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:27,221
Mm...

508
00:37:27,864 --> 00:37:29,409
The truth is, I don't know.

509
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:31,509
What's that expression?

510
00:37:32,026 --> 00:37:33,720
"It ain't over till it's over "?

511
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,779
Shh... Hello?

512
00:37:42,964 --> 00:37:44,670
Allison, I'm sorry to wake you.

513
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:48,611
It's okay. What's the matter? What's... what's up?

514
00:37:48,789 --> 00:37:51,103
I just got a call from the chief of police.

515
00:37:51,722 --> 00:37:53,243
Sometime around 11:00 this evening,

516
00:37:53,294 --> 00:37:56,253
Marilyn Downey swallowed two fistfuls of sleeping pills.

517
00:37:57,076 --> 00:37:59,119
She was pronounced dead about half an hour ago.

518
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,692
No, no. No, that... that's, that's wrong.

519
00:38:03,743 --> 00:38:04,823
I had a dream.

520
00:38:05,703 --> 00:38:09,549
He turned out to be a really great kid, and she was a big part of that.

521
00:38:09,938 --> 00:38:11,115
He mentioned her...

522
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:15,758
I, uh... I don't know what to tell you.

523
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:17,253
I don't really know what you're talking about.

524
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:21,614
Marilyn Downey is dead. Just thought you'd want to know.

525
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,475
I actually thought that you'd be relieved.

526
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:25,923
I mean...

527
00:38:26,663 --> 00:38:30,302
This may be a horrible thing to say, but at least the boy is safe now.

528
00:38:32,313 --> 00:38:33,218
Allison?

529
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:36,021
It's okay. I-I just thought...

530
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:44,335
I guess I hoped... that things would turn out differently.

531
00:38:48,514 --> 00:38:49,932
I guess I'll see you in the morning.

532
00:38:50,382 --> 00:38:51,531
See you in the morning.

533
00:38:56,771 --> 00:38:58,314
In the days leading up to graduation,

534
00:38:58,677 --> 00:39:01,184
a number of people have asked me:

535
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:08,814
"Is there one person or one event that has inspired you through your high school career?"

536
00:39:10,487 --> 00:39:14,212
For me, the person who made the biggest difference was my mom.

537
00:39:19,093 --> 00:39:21,338
My dad likes to tell me how devoted she was to me.

538
00:39:23,088 --> 00:39:27,084
Actually, "obsessed" is the word he often uses to describe it.

539
00:39:30,527 --> 00:39:34,845
We don't talk about it much, but when I was seven,

540
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:41,170
a stranger came into  my bedroom and drugged me and shot me and left me for dead.

541
00:39:44,038 --> 00:39:45,316
I barely remember the experience,

542
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:51,402
but, apparently, my mother was devastated by it and felt somehow responsible.

543
00:39:55,763 --> 00:40:00,166
She never forgave herself and apparently consumed by guilt and depression,

544
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:05,023
she took her own life shortly thereafter.

545
00:40:10,095 --> 00:40:12,333
I do remember how badly people felt for me,

546
00:40:14,173 --> 00:40:17,220
how concerned everyone was that I would grow up without a mother.

547
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:23,157
But I'm here to tell you that not a day goes by that I don't think of her,

548
00:40:24,874 --> 00:40:28,782
not a day goes by... that I don't feel her here with me.

549
00:40:32,149 --> 00:40:37,389
And not a day goes by that I'm not reminded of how fleeting life is,

550
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:40,861
how much it is that we have to get done

551
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:44,420
and how important it is that we do it well.

552
00:40:45,633 --> 00:40:49,274
Thanks, Mom. I've tried to make you proud.

553
00:40:59,398 --> 00:41:04,525
