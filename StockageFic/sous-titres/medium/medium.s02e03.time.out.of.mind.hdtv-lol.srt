1
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:25,000
Hi, again.

2
00:00:27,459 --> 00:00:30,663
Uh, I've been waiting to see the director for 40 minutes now.

3
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,319
Do you have any idea how much longer he's going to be?

4
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,465
I'm sorry, all I can say is he does know you're here.

5
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:40,509
Well, I believe District Attorney Devalos spoke with him.

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,041
He arranged for me to see one of your patients at 9:30.

7
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,433
Ma'am, I understand exactly what you want.

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,575
I understand exactly why you're here.

9
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,788
But you're just going to have to take a seat until the doctor comes down.

10
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,493
Well, maybe you could just page him.

11
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,690
You know, I have already called twice.

12
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,150
Now, there's really nothing else to do but take a seat.

13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,270
Look, you know what?

14
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,157
He's obviously pretty busy today.

15
00:01:04,158 --> 00:01:05,606
You all seem pretty busy today.

16
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,210
So I think what I'm gonna have to do for now is,

17
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:12,626
I'm just gonna leave,
and I'll call back tomorrow and try to reschedule, okay?

18
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:23,080
I'm sorry, um, I think I need you to buzz me out.

19
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:25,673
I think you really need to take a seat.

20
00:01:26,902 --> 00:01:28,077
Excuse me?

21
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:31,028
Come on, now, Beverly,
just take a seat.

22
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:33,772
You know, let's not go through this all over again.

23
00:01:33,773 --> 00:01:34,957
I'm sorry,
go through what again?

24
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,867
I don't know what you're talking about.

25
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:39,863
My name isn't Beverly.
Could you just open the door?

26
00:01:45,214 --> 00:01:48,993
Okay, obviously we've had a huge misunderstanding here.

27
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:51,078
You know the Day Room rules, Beverly.

28
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,943
You've been asked to take a seat--

29
00:01:52,944 --> 00:01:53,895
take a seat.

30
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,619
I am happy to take a seat,

31
00:01:55,664 --> 00:02:00,180
but perhaps you could just call the director and let him know that Allison Dubois--

32
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:00,955
not Beverly--

33
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:03,386
is here to see him.

34
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,199
We're happy to make that call, Beverly,

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,334
if you'll just come with us.

36
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,495
What? What?

37
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:09,527
Hey! Get off me!

38
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:11,053
- Beverly.
- How dare you!

39
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,707
- This is a mistake!|- Calm down.

40
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,256
Beverly. Don't... Beverly.

41
00:02:14,307 --> 00:02:16,951
I'm Allison Dubois! I'm here to see the director!

42
00:02:16,952 --> 00:02:18,842
- Beverly, calm down.
- Let me go

43
00:02:19,022 --> 00:02:21,246
Please don't do this!

44
00:02:21,404 --> 00:02:22,122
Please!

45
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:23,851
I'm not a patient!

46
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:25,155
Please don't...

47
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:26,532
Please don't do this.

48
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,029
Please! Please!

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,186
I'm not a patient!

50
00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:29,956
Please...

51
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:34,567
Now, try to relax now, Beverly.

52
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,257
This will only hurt for a moment.

53
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,049
Thank God you're up.

54
00:02:49,147 --> 00:02:51,347
Um, you know if we have any more aspirin?

55
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:54,062
What? Aspirin?

56
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:55,855
Um...

57
00:02:56,788 --> 00:03:00,235
I-I... think there's some in the kids' bathroom,

58
00:03:00,286 --> 00:03:01,121
some chewables.

59
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,958
Why?

60
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:04,989
My head's killing me.

61
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:08,076
Oh, tell me about it.

62
00:03:55,137 --> 00:03:56,858
Mom!

63
00:03:59,765 --> 00:04:01,345
I think we're out of milk.

64
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,357
I just bought some last night -- look again.

65
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:04,290
Here.

66
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:08,482
10:00 should be fine for the McMillan meeting.

67
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:11,112
Yeah. Just make sure that Mike and Steve know.

68
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:13,354
All right, what'll it be, yogurt or cereal?

69
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:14,835
Yogurt with cereal on top.

70
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:17,240
And you, milady?

71
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:18,695
Breath mints.

72
00:04:19,063 --> 00:04:21,463
Well, that is not an option, so try again.

73
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:24,121
- Oh, yogurt.
- Okay.

74
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,270
Let's go shopping.

75
00:04:26,997 --> 00:04:29,137
- Aren't you a little old for dolls?
- Ariel.

76
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:32,609
The box said, "For ages five and up."

77
00:04:32,702 --> 00:04:33,456
So?

78
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,327
So, I'm ages five and up.

79
00:04:36,557 --> 00:04:38,849
- You don't act like it.
- Ariel.

80
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,828
All right, I'll see you soon.

81
00:04:41,937 --> 00:04:43,091
I like to color.

82
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:45,028
Okay.

83
00:04:47,886 --> 00:04:49,599
How's your headache?
Any better?

84
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,580
Much. I may never take grown-up aspirin again.

85
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:57,285
Mommy... Bridgette's taking breath mints out of your purse.

86
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:00,066
Aren't you a little old to tattletale?

87
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:01,065
Bridgette.

88
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:03,357
You, finish your yogurt;

89
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:06,788
you, stop taking things out of my purse without asking. Got it?

90
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:07,745
Got it.

91
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:09,672
All right, put those mints down.

92
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:10,858
Finish your yogurt.

93
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:13,894
The Mommy Express is leaving for school in ten minutes.

94
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:27,384
I.D. badge?

95
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:30,299
Bridgette.

96
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,093
It seems...

97
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:36,778
my seven-year-old's made off with it.

98
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,173
But I do have my driver's license, though.

99
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:42,127
I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't let you through without your badge.

100
00:05:42,128 --> 00:05:43,131
Come  on, you know me.

101
00:05:43,132 --> 00:05:44,594
I'm here almost every morning.

102
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,715
I understand, ma'am, but without your badge, I can't let you through.

103
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:49,146
Why don't you just give your office a call,

104
00:05:49,147 --> 00:05:53,147
have them phone down to Security and put your name on the visitors list?

105
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:55,319
Oh, Bridgette,

106
00:05:55,324 --> 00:05:56,923
not my cell phone.

107
00:05:57,118 --> 00:05:59,378
Okay, is there a pay phone or something?

108
00:06:05,724 --> 00:06:07,624
I'm sorry, I'm expecting a call.

109
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:11,856
Okay, well... I just have to call upstairs.
It'll just take a second.

110
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:14,167
H ello?

111
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,266
No, no, no.
Don't-don't hang up.

112
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:18,150
Just... just talk to me.

113
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:20,060
Do you have the baby?

114
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:23,284
Of course. I'll meet you anywhere you like.

115
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:25,966
Just-just promise me that you won't hurt her.

116
00:06:29,415 --> 00:06:33,243
Hi. I'm sorry, I don't mean to be a bother, but I'm late for an important meeting.

117
00:06:33,244 --> 00:06:35,456
Is there any way you could use your security phone

118
00:06:35,457 --> 00:06:37,491
to call the District Attorney's Office and get me cleared?

119
00:06:37,492 --> 00:06:39,107
I would really appreciate it.

120
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:45,346
- What's your name?
- Allison Dubois. Thank you.

121
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:49,817
Ma'am?

122
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:52,943
I'm afraid they don't know you up there.

123
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:53,544
What?

124
00:06:53,762 --> 00:06:55,122
The District Attorney's Office.

125
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,754
They said there's no one by the name of Allison Dubois on their staff.

126
00:06:57,755 --> 00:06:59,353
Well, that's not possible.

127
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,518
- Who did you talk to?
- Ma'am...

128
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,324
I'm sorry, could you just try again?

129
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:05,694
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I was violating procedure calling the first time.

130
00:07:05,695 --> 00:07:07,993
No, I know, but maybe if you let me talk to them...

131
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,396
I'm sorry, ma'am, you're just gonna have to go home and get your badge.

132
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:11,730
This is ridiculous.

133
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,190
Please don't raise your voice, ma'am.

134
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:15,200
I'm not raising my voice!

135
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:17,319
I am trying to get into my office.

136
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,713
Do you have a problem here?

137
00:07:18,714 --> 00:07:19,554
Well, kind of.

138
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:22,720
She claims she works in the District Attorney's Office and forgot her badge.

139
00:07:22,721 --> 00:07:25,550
But when I called upstairs, they claimed they didn't know her.

140
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:26,725
It's just a misunderstanding.

141
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:28,721
Do you have an I.D. badge, ma'am?

142
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:31,502
Yes. But apparently, I left it at home.

143
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:35,703
Well, I think the only thing to do, then, is to go back home and get it.

144
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,850
You're right.

145
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,290
I'll just drive home and get it.

146
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,670
Appreciate it, miss.

147
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:50,356
And would you mind if we escorted you back to your car?

148
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:54,067
You know, this really isn't necessary.

149
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:55,924
I think I can find my own car.

150
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:01,402
My car is gone!

151
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:05,014
Now, are you sure this is where you parked it?

152
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:07,542
Yes! Yeah!

153
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:08,627
Yes, I'm sure!

154
00:08:08,678 --> 00:08:10,165
This is my spot.

155
00:08:10,678 --> 00:08:12,819
I park right here every day.

156
00:08:13,852 --> 00:08:15,524
Right next to this red truck.

157
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,695
Why are you looking at me that way?

158
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:23,038
My-my car has been stolen.

159
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:25,618
Yes, ma'am.
So how do you want to do this?

160
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:27,577
You want to fill a report out now,

161
00:08:27,578 --> 00:08:29,936
standing here in the middle of the parking lot?

162
00:08:29,937 --> 00:08:34,165
Or would you like us to run you home, 
so you can get your badge and whatever else you need,

163
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,629
and fill it out in your office when you get back?

164
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,609
Yes.

165
00:08:38,454 --> 00:08:41,129
Yes, please, if you could run me home and back.

166
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:46,156
Thank you.

167
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:56,189
Problem?

168
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,460
My key isn't working.

169
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,494
Are you sure you live here?

170
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,129
What kind of question is that?
Of course I live here.

171
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,935
I've lived here for nine years.

172
00:09:08,953 --> 00:09:12,141
- Can I help you?|- I don't know.

173
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:15,421
- Can I help you? What are you doing in my house?

174
00:09:16,897 --> 00:09:17,823
Officers...

175
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,410
Don't talk to them, talk to me!

176
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:21,216
What are you doing in my house?

177
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:22,749
Sorry to bother you.

178
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,043
Do you know this woman?

179
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:25,814
Does this woman live here, ma'am?

180
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,910
No. I'm sorry, I've never seen her before in my life.

181
00:09:29,245 --> 00:09:30,519
She's lying!

182
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,054
This is preposterous!

183
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,040
This is my house!

184
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,979
Go ask my neighbors, go inside, go look at my things.

185
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,560
Sorry to have bothered you, ma'am.

186
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:38,294
Our mistake.

187
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,490
This is my house!

188
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:46,208
My children live in this house!

189
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:47,952
My husband lives in this house!

190
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:49,458
This is my house!

191
00:09:50,325 --> 00:09:51,797
You have to believe me!

192
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:53,405
You have to help me!

193
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:57,203
We do believe you, and we do want to help you.

194
00:09:57,587 --> 00:09:58,663
Stop it!

195
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:00,979
Stop it! Stop it, please!

196
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,045
Listen to me!

197
00:10:02,557 --> 00:10:04,509
You're making a terrible mistake!

198
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:09,876
Welcome back, Beverly.

199
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:15,966
That'll be all, gentlemen.

200
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:16,577
Thank  you.

201
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:22,631
Try to relax now, Beverly.

202
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:26,715
Why do you keep calling me that?

203
00:10:27,136 --> 00:10:28,197
'Cause it's your name.

204
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:30,332
No. My name is Allison.

205
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:32,254
Allison Dubois.

206
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:38,442
Please...

207
00:10:39,782 --> 00:10:41,665
I need to call my husband.

208
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:43,992
You mean Joe?

209
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:46,470
How do you know that?

210
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:49,056
We've been at this for how long now, Beverly?

211
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:51,723
Eight months?

212
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:53,434
Nine?

213
00:10:53,697 --> 00:10:55,962
I don't know what you're talking about.

214
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:58,765
I have never been here before.

215
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:04,296
You know, I understand the allure of "Allison Dubois." I do.

216
00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:08,335
I understand why you want to be her.

217
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:15,092
She has a loving husband, three beautiful children, an exciting career.

218
00:11:16,295 --> 00:11:22,043
But we have to confront the fact that Allison Dubois isn't real,

219
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:26,533
and that the deeper you lose yourself in the fantasy of her life,

220
00:11:27,202 --> 00:11:30,792
the less likely you are to ever find any sort of true happiness.

221
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:35,160
Now, what year is it?

222
00:11:35,976 --> 00:11:36,965
Excuse me?

223
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:37,829
The year.

224
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:41,461
Beverly, I'd like you to tell me what the year is.

225
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:44,428
2005?

226
00:11:57,277 --> 00:11:59,987
This is the 12th of June, 1959.

227
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:02,665
I don't understand.

228
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:11,749
The only thing you need to understand is there's a very real world out there and it's just waiting for you.

229
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:15,424
The sooner you accept that...

230
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:21,528
the sooner you let go of Allison, the sooner you're going to get better.

231
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:38,248
Oh.

232
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:41,257
Thank God you're up.

233
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,365
Um, you know if we have any more aspirin?

234
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:57,901
Mom!

235
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:01,316
I think we're out of milk.

236
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:03,826
I got some last night.
Look again.

237
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:04,768
Here.

238
00:13:05,706 --> 00:13:08,286
10:00 should be fine for the McMillan meeting.

239
00:13:08,397 --> 00:13:10,375
Just make sure that Mike and Steve know.

240
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:11,549
Let's go shopping.

241
00:13:11,693 --> 00:13:13,204
Aren't you a little old for dolls?

242
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:14,254
The box said,

243
00:13:14,305 --> 00:13:16,517
"For ages five and up."

244
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:17,516
So?

245
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:21,112
So... I'm ages five and up.

246
00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:22,529
You don't act like it.

247
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,293
You okay?

248
00:13:23,673 --> 00:13:25,478
Look like you just saw a ghost.

249
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,362
Wait, scratch that.

250
00:13:26,363 --> 00:13:30,188
You look like someone who isn't you would look if they saw a ghost.

251
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,239
Everything that just happened here, I dreamt last night.

252
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:36,919
You glimpsed a future in which you poured yogurt?

253
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,225
My God, stop her before she dreams again.

254
00:13:39,623 --> 00:13:41,566
- I'm serious.
- Mommy.

255
00:13:42,384 --> 00:13:45,187
Bridgette's getting breath mints out of your purse.

256
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:49,143
- Aren't you getting a little too old to be a tattletale?
- That, too?

257
00:13:51,591 --> 00:13:52,785
I am awake, right?

258
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,138
Ow!

259
00:13:55,362 --> 00:13:56,285
You're awake.

260
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,149
I'm dreaming.

261
00:14:06,974 --> 00:14:07,991
ID badge?

262
00:14:09,471 --> 00:14:10,071
Oh.

263
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,465
Can't... I can't seem to find it.

264
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,352
But I'm sure if you call the District Attorney's office...

265
00:14:20,353 --> 00:14:21,333
Mrs. Dubois?

266
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:23,191
It's all right.

267
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:25,632
Just be sure and remember it tomorrow, okay?

268
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:31,259
30 years, Arizona State Correctional Facility.

269
00:14:31,856 --> 00:14:32,956
It's a gift, Maggie.

270
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:34,293
Aw, I'm touched.

271
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:38,931
I hope you won't be hurt when I try and return it and get something better.

272
00:14:38,932 --> 00:14:40,841
Margaret, your client murdered his own parents.

273
00:14:40,842 --> 00:14:42,323
He did it with a skilsaw.

274
00:14:42,324 --> 00:14:45,848
Then he went out to dinner with some friends and used his father's credit card to pay the bill.

275
00:14:45,849 --> 00:14:46,921
There is nothing better.

276
00:14:46,922 --> 00:14:49,457
Now, you know, ordinarily I'd agree with you.

277
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:55,205
But in this case, he wasn't in his right mind when he committed those terrible acts.

278
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:57,024
He didn't know what he was doing.

279
00:14:57,025 --> 00:14:57,968
And under the law...

280
00:14:57,969 --> 00:14:58,838
Please.

281
00:14:59,012 --> 00:15:03,307
What about when he buried the bodies and scrubbed down the house with bleach to get rid of the evidence?

282
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:04,873
Was he in his right mind then?

283
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:06,027
Or his left?

284
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:08,901
Isn't he delightful?

285
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,622
He actually thinks the person who scoffs the most wins.

286
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:15,434
Whether you like it or not, Manuel,

287
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:20,737
Timothy Kercher has a severe dissociative identity disorder.

288
00:15:20,846 --> 00:15:26,979
In fact, one of the leading psychiatrists at the
University of Arizona is prepared to come to court

289
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:34,440
and to testifiy that an alternate personnality was responsible
for both the crime and the attempt to cover it up.

290
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:35,091
Really?

291
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:36,971
- Both.
- An alternate personality?

292
00:15:37,531 --> 00:15:40,252
I wonder which one stood to inherit his parents' money.

293
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:41,138
Come on, Manny.

294
00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:43,041
We both know how this is going to go.

295
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:47,258
I'm going to trot out my expert who says that the kid is too crazy to stand trial.

296
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:50,298
And you're going to trot out yours that says he's not.

297
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:53,064
We're going to waste a lot of money and a lot of time

298
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:56,270
and a judge is going to appoint somebody to break the tie.

299
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:57,139
Exactly.

300
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:02,411
Which  is why I was hoping you might be more receptive to my offer.

301
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,594
Here's what I'm prepared to do.

302
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:07,811
Let my staff and me interview him one last time.

303
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:10,717
If we think that he's not competent to stand trial,

304
00:16:11,182 --> 00:16:13,262
I'll stipulate as such to the court.

305
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:14,662
What are you up to?

306
00:16:15,412 --> 00:16:17,582
Just trying to save us both some time.

307
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:19,681
If we concur with your expert,

308
00:16:19,682 --> 00:16:23,484
then Kercher will be remanded to a psychiatric facility for treatment inside of a week.

309
00:16:23,485 --> 00:16:26,760
If not, you're no worse off than when you walked in here.

310
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,979
Yeah, I'll, um, set up something for this afternoon.

311
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,389
I like her.

312
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:45,888
That makes two of us.

313
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,454
How long has she been sick?

314
00:16:51,683 --> 00:16:52,753
Found out a few months ago.

315
00:16:52,754 --> 00:16:54,513
Apparently there's not much they can do.

316
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,309
That's awful.

317
00:16:55,868 --> 00:17:00,608
Part of me actually hopes that I'm wrong about Kercher and we can wrap this up fast.

318
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:04,399
Who knows, maybe there are alternative therapies out there.

319
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,175
The sooner this is over, the sooner she can try and find some help.

320
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,335
It was like coming out of a deep sleep.

321
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:15,475
Only I couldn't have been sleeping, because I was standing.

322
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:17,186
And I was breathing hard.

323
00:17:17,677 --> 00:17:20,452
Like I'd just run ten miles as fast as I could.

324
00:17:21,803 --> 00:17:23,648
But that made no sense because...

325
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,194
I was standing in the middle of my living room.

326
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:32,698
At first I thought I must be sick, and so I started to check my pulse.

327
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,436
And that's when I noticed...

328
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:39,396
the piece of scalp on the back of my hand.

329
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:47,843
It must have been my mother's because the hair was definitely blonde.

330
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,961
And when I touched it, it was still wet.

331
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:53,913
Still warm.

332
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:56,804
Like it hadn't been there very long.

333
00:17:58,898 --> 00:18:00,478
And that's when it hit me.

334
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,052
He'd done it.

335
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,680
He'd finally gone and done it.

336
00:18:08,396 --> 00:18:09,547
I'm sorry.

337
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:11,387
Who did what, Mr. Kercher?

338
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:17,399
Mr. Kercher?

339
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,372
Jack.

340
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:26,951
He hated my parents.

341
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:29,013
He's always hated my parents.

342
00:18:29,202 --> 00:18:31,597
He'd been threatening to kill them forever.

343
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:32,955
I see.

344
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,234
So where is Jack now?

345
00:18:36,285 --> 00:18:37,452
Come on, now.

346
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,428
I know you know.
I know they told you all about him.

347
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,235
You know exactly where he is.

348
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:46,585
Well, no.

349
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,778
I'm sorry.
This is the first I've heard of him.

350
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,570
He's here.

351
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,133
He's inside me...

352
00:18:57,293 --> 00:18:58,245
listening.

353
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:01,524
He can hear every word you say.

354
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:02,125
Really?

355
00:19:03,238 --> 00:19:04,123
That's amazing.

356
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,264
It is.

357
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:08,928
So may I speak with Jack?

358
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:10,964
No.

359
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:14,294
I'm sorry.

360
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,126
Jack's not speaking today.

361
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:19,034
It hurts when Jack talks.

362
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:22,328
- Really, this will just take a second.
- No.

363
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,344
He won't do it.

364
00:19:25,726 --> 00:19:26,775
It hurts.

365
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:29,279
Yes, it hurts--
I understand.

366
00:19:29,594 --> 00:19:32,532
He said it hurts, you fat, bald bastard!

367
00:19:33,662 --> 00:19:35,362
Come here!

368
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,791
Come here! Come closer!

369
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:39,167
I'll rip your nose off!

370
00:19:39,168 --> 00:19:40,740
I'll rip your ears off!

371
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,986
Come here!

372
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:43,208
Any one of you!

373
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:44,409
Come on!

374
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:46,011
Come on!

375
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:48,608
Quite a performance, huh?

376
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:51,061
I don't know...
he seemed pretty convincing to me.

377
00:19:51,062 --> 00:19:53,744
You're saying that because you sense something, because you saw something?

378
00:19:53,745 --> 00:19:54,630
No, not really.

379
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,660
It's just...
he genuinely scared me.

380
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:58,416
I did get some numbers, though.

381
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,600
Couldn't tell you if they make him a liar or not.

382
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:02,776
Just the same nine numbers over and over again.

383
00:20:02,777 --> 00:20:05,998
Seven-nine-six-zero-zero-two-eight-oh-five.

384
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:07,466
Do you know what they could mean?

385
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:10,367
Beats me.
Maybe it's Jack's social security number.

386
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:11,338
Hang on.

387
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:14,359
I got to get back to the office.
See you tomorrow.

388
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,223
Yeah, go.

389
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,056
Welcome back, Beverly.

390
00:20:30,826 --> 00:20:32,040
Our proud founder.

391
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:34,324
Really?

392
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:36,283
He started all this?

393
00:20:36,284 --> 00:20:38,831
Well, with a lot of help and some government funding.

394
00:20:38,832 --> 00:20:40,500
Oh, forgive me.
My name's Roger.

395
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:41,361
I'm a graduate student.

396
00:20:41,362 --> 00:20:43,816
I'm doing my thesis on the history of this place.

397
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:45,171
You know, I didn't mean to startle you,

398
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:47,230
it's just nobody ever stops to look at these pictures.

399
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,041
I thought maybe you escaped from one of the wards.

400
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:52,214
Afraid not, Roger.

401
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:55,338
I'm Allison.
I work with the District Attorney's office.

402
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:56,366
And his name is?

403
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:57,527
Dr. Elliot Peterson.

404
00:20:57,946 --> 00:20:59,746
Very highly regarded in his day.

405
00:20:59,848 --> 00:21:01,909
Of course, a lot of what he did, a lot of what he advocated,

406
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,914
we consider barbaric now, but at the time...

407
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:07,688
That's strange.

408
00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:09,182
This corridor looks brand new.

409
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:09,968
That's because it is.

410
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,355
You're standing in the new wing.
The old wing's in the rear.

411
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:15,614
That's where Peterson used to play with the cutting edge therapies of the 1950s.

412
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:18,368
Electroshock, insulin-shock, ice baths.

413
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:22,438
Yes, it was a great time to be young, free and mentally ill.

414
00:21:23,093 --> 00:21:26,542
They were going to tear all this down back when they built the new wing back in 1997,

415
00:21:26,543 --> 00:21:28,056
but they ran out of funding.

416
00:21:28,057 --> 00:21:28,852
Lucky for me.

417
00:21:28,936 --> 00:21:31,791
It's a treasure trove of information for my thesis.

418
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:34,551
Well, this is it.

419
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:42,306
497 patient histories detailing 28 years worth of unintentional psychiatric cruelty.

420
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,035
Pretty impressive, huh?

421
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,368
Sure is.

422
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:52,424
You ever run across a file on a patient named Beverly?

423
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:54,410
Does this Beverly have a last name?

424
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:55,589
Never mind.

425
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:03,095
She would have been a patient of Dr. Peterson's around July, 1959.

426
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:11,959
We have a Beverly Waller,
admitted November 3, 1958.

427
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,709
I think we have some film on her if you're interested.

428
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,155
Beverly Waller suffered a nervous collapse in the fall of 1958.

429
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:21,074
Separated from her husband shortly thereafter,

430
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:25,696
but he sued for custody of their eight-month-old daughter and won.

431
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:28,071
Almost unheard of back then.

432
00:22:29,672 --> 00:22:32,256
Patient fell into a deep and unrecoverable depressive state,

433
00:22:32,257 --> 00:22:37,432
kidnapped her child and apparently threw herself and her infant daughter off the Mayawoch Bridge.

434
00:22:38,304 --> 00:22:39,324
Mom was rescued...

435
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,658
Child apparently drowned.

436
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,751
Beverly was committed here shortly thereafter.

437
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:46,103
Thank you.

438
00:22:47,974 --> 00:22:50,649
All right, you got to say "roll 'em." Roll 'em.

439
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:58,663
Please, you have to let me out of here.

440
00:23:00,555 --> 00:23:02,850
I have to pick up my children.

441
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:06,464
You know you don't have any children, Beverly?

442
00:23:07,371 --> 00:23:08,297
Not anymore.

443
00:23:08,707 --> 00:23:10,148
You're wrong.

444
00:23:11,886 --> 00:23:13,236
I have three of them.

445
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:18,645
They're probably wondering where I am!

446
00:23:22,355 --> 00:23:23,808
What year is it?

447
00:23:24,754 --> 00:23:27,223
Why do you keep asking me that?

448
00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:29,100
Beverly, come on.

449
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:31,167
Just tell me the year, please.

450
00:23:32,426 --> 00:23:34,600
It's the year 2005.

451
00:23:37,396 --> 00:23:40,061
And you know damn well my name's not Beverly.

452
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,290
It's Allison.

453
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,521
Allison Dubois.

454
00:23:54,904 --> 00:23:56,331
She thought she was you?

455
00:23:57,762 --> 00:23:59,887
Not Joan of Arc, not the Virgin Mary,

456
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:03,541
not Madam Curie,
but Allison Dubois living in the year 2005 ?

457
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:05,843
She knew your name.
She knew all the girls' names.

458
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,873
She knew everyone's birthdays.

459
00:24:07,991 --> 00:24:10,431
She named the street we live on, everything.

460
00:24:15,006 --> 00:24:16,671
Does that make me a bigamist?

461
00:24:19,706 --> 00:24:22,701
There's got to be some sort of a logical explanation.

462
00:24:23,304 --> 00:24:26,124
I know. I mean, I keep going over it in my head.

463
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:27,758
I mean, I know it makes no sense,

464
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,647
but I can't help wondering if maybe I had something to do with this.

465
00:24:33,063 --> 00:24:35,474
Allison, this woman lived half a century ago.

466
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,574
How can you possibly have anything to do with it?

467
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:38,423
I don't know.

468
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:41,102
Maybe when I was dreaming about her, I got into her head.

469
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:44,268
I projected thoughts from the present without realizing it.

470
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,862
Wait a second. Now you're beaming
your brain waves back in time? Come on.

471
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:49,011
I mean, I don't think so.

472
00:24:49,012 --> 00:24:51,035
Oh, forget it. You know what?

473
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,545
I'm just trying to makes sense out of it.

474
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:58,540
I can't tell you how eerie it is to sit in a room and watch someone from

475
00:24:58,591 --> 00:25:02,988
before you were born recite all the pertinent facts of your life.

476
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,601
Speaking of which, is my first wife still alive?

477
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:11,314
She died of amyloidosis in 1962.

478
00:25:12,222 --> 00:25:13,429
Sounds grisly.

479
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,763
What is that, a brain thing?

480
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:15,929
It's a liver thing.

481
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:16,991
Uh-huh.

482
00:25:17,548 --> 00:25:18,657
Genetic disorder.

483
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:27,669
Hey!

484
00:25:28,481 --> 00:25:30,911
Hey. Hey, is that it?

485
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:33,385
Aren't you going to help me figure out what to do?

486
00:25:33,386 --> 00:25:35,049
What do you mean?
What is there to do?

487
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,445
I mean, a woman's dead.

488
00:25:36,497 --> 00:25:38,162
There's no bringing her back.

489
00:25:38,766 --> 00:25:40,772
You're good, but you're not that good.

490
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,803
Now let your husband get some sleep.

491
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:44,574
The first Allison always did.

492
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:56,553
Beverly, I need you to listen to me.

493
00:25:57,621 --> 00:25:59,471
I need you to try to understand.

494
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:03,235
This was never about me trying to take Anna from you.

495
00:26:03,236 --> 00:26:05,406
I would never keep you from our child.

496
00:26:06,764 --> 00:26:07,951
I know how much you love her,

497
00:26:07,952 --> 00:26:10,722
and I know that you would never try to hurt her.

498
00:26:11,898 --> 00:26:13,445
So, please,
just give her to me.

499
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,123
- No!
- Okay, okay,

500
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:18,859
just, just. if you don't trust me,
then give her to your sister.

501
00:26:23,513 --> 00:26:25,972
Please, Bev, it's cold out here.

502
00:26:26,023 --> 00:26:29,517
Let's just go back to the house, talk this thing through.

503
00:26:30,263 --> 00:26:34,537
Someday you'll understand all this, Carol, I promise.

504
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,633
And someday, it will all be clear.

505
00:26:41,537 --> 00:26:42,911
No!

506
00:26:52,128 --> 00:26:55,372
Allison, I didn't expect to see you here today.

507
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:59,198
I just stopped by to do a little research.

508
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:02,154
Any new progress on the Kercher case?

509
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:07,001
We still haven't been able to identify that string of numbers you saw.

510
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:09,632
Best guess is that it's a bank account number.

511
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:14,480
Although it doesn't seem to match up with any of the accounts in Kercher's name.

512
00:27:15,595 --> 00:27:17,527
You going to be around for a while?

513
00:27:17,528 --> 00:27:20,163
I was just going to do this one thing and go.

514
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,460
Not a problem.

515
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:24,166
If something changes, I'll give you a call.

516
00:27:33,241 --> 00:27:34,224
Hello?

517
00:27:37,346 --> 00:27:38,502
Carol Waller Smith?

518
00:27:40,648 --> 00:27:41,604
Carol Waller?

519
00:27:42,957 --> 00:27:45,032
Are you the sister of Beverly Waller?

520
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,815
Can I help you?

521
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:48,064
Well, I hope so.

522
00:27:48,955 --> 00:27:51,900
I work for the District Attorney's office in Phoenix.

523
00:27:51,941 --> 00:27:53,441
My name is Allison Dubois.

524
00:27:57,187 --> 00:28:04,388
So, you want me to try and make sense of something that makes no sense...

525
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,086
Mrs. Dubois.

526
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:09,242
If that really is your name.

527
00:28:10,143 --> 00:28:11,488
That really is my name.

528
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:18,545
A mother isn't supposed to want to kill herself, let alone her own child.

529
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,737
And I loved my sister.

530
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,344
Do love my sister.

531
00:28:25,674 --> 00:28:27,989
So ask me whatever you want.

532
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,277
Tell me about her breakdown.

533
00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:36,036
Tell me about what happened.

534
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,835
Well, it was right...

535
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:44,298
after the birth of her only child, Anna.

536
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:48,562
She started having nightmares;

537
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:51,203
terrible dreams...

538
00:28:52,055 --> 00:28:53,440
about her husband Walter.

539
00:28:55,624 --> 00:28:59,144
In them, he was...
doing things.

540
00:29:00,457 --> 00:29:02,011
Terrible things to Anna.

541
00:29:02,682 --> 00:29:03,571
What happened?

542
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:06,552
I told her to see a doctor.

543
00:29:08,072 --> 00:29:10,562
She saw two or three doctors and they all...

544
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,871
gave her something to help her sleep.

545
00:29:13,872 --> 00:29:15,013
And the more she slept...

546
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:16,433
The more she had the nightmares.

547
00:29:16,434 --> 00:29:20,159
And she became convinced that she had to get Anna away from Walter.

548
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:22,364
And that's when she left him.

549
00:29:22,365 --> 00:29:24,950
She and Anna moved in with my husband and me.

550
00:29:25,115 --> 00:29:27,321
Did she ever tell anyone else about her dreams?

551
00:29:27,322 --> 00:29:28,586
Oh, a lot of people.

552
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,780
It didn't help at all.

553
00:29:31,952 --> 00:29:35,084
Walter was so well liked in our town.

554
00:29:35,135 --> 00:29:36,258
He was a war veteran.

555
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:38,849
He was principal of the junior high school.

556
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,175
He was a man people looked up to.

557
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:43,323
So when the custody battle started...

558
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:44,809
It all went Walter's way.

559
00:29:46,033 --> 00:29:47,463
You know, in retrospect...

560
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:53,265
I think people wished they'd taken my sister a little more seriously.

561
00:29:54,988 --> 00:29:56,743
She may have been crazy, but...

562
00:29:58,132 --> 00:30:01,306
she obviously knew there was something really wrong with Walter.

563
00:30:01,307 --> 00:30:02,332
What do you mean?

564
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:05,824
I would have thought you'd known.

565
00:30:09,145 --> 00:30:11,215
Several years after Beverly's passing,

566
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:16,517
a parent at Walter's school marched into his office and shot him to death.

567
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,710
Walter had been molesting his little girl since the sixth grade.

568
00:30:31,927 --> 00:30:34,922
She's psychic, Joe, just like me.
That's the answer.

569
00:30:35,598 --> 00:30:37,682
Whoa, whoa, slow down.
Who's psychic?

570
00:30:37,683 --> 00:30:39,483
Beverly Waller. She had a dream,

571
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,306
a vision that her husband was going to hurt their daughter.

572
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,492
That's why she tried to get her away from him.

573
00:30:44,493 --> 00:30:45,256
Okay.

574
00:30:45,432 --> 00:30:47,060
And that's how she knew so much about me,

575
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:50,606
about my life-- because she saw it in her mind, in her visions.

576
00:30:51,323 --> 00:30:52,592
But Al, she didn't just see you.

577
00:30:52,593 --> 00:30:54,123
She said that she was you.

578
00:30:54,407 --> 00:30:58,769
Exactly. I don't think she understood what she truly was.

579
00:31:00,913 --> 00:31:05,252
All these terrible images kept popping into her head and she didn't understand why.

580
00:31:05,253 --> 00:31:07,648
When she tried to turn to others for help,

581
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:12,002
tried to tell them what she was seeing, they told her she was crazy.

582
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:14,939
And I guess after a while, she believed them.

583
00:31:15,237 --> 00:31:20,229
Al, we're talking about a murderer here, somebody who took the life of her own child.

584
00:31:20,614 --> 00:31:21,412
I know.

585
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:28,093
I think... I guess that she became convinced that killing Anna was preferable

586
00:31:28,144 --> 00:31:32,184
to whatever torture she saw her husband inflict every night in her dreams.

587
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:33,724
I still don't get it.

588
00:31:33,812 --> 00:31:34,747
Don't get what?

589
00:31:34,897 --> 00:31:39,959
All right, I understand now how Beverly Waller knew all about our lives back in 1959.

590
00:31:41,238 --> 00:31:45,467
Can you please tell me why she was dreaming about you in the first place?

591
00:31:46,513 --> 00:31:49,553
Or for that matter, why you're dreaming about her now?

592
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:54,078
Allison?

593
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:01,259
I have no idea.

594
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:11,369
Today is July 17, 1959...

595
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,558
Did I miss the previews?

596
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,065
I don't think we're getting any reception in here.

597
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:18,164
I'm worried if the girls wake up, they're not going to know where we are.

598
00:32:18,165 --> 00:32:19,846
One can only hope.

599
00:32:20,795 --> 00:32:23,105
I'm kidding.
I told them where we were.

600
00:32:24,392 --> 00:32:25,967
They're all out of popcorn.

601
00:32:26,493 --> 00:32:27,878
Mornings are the hardest.

602
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:31,602
That's when I miss them the most.

603
00:32:32,092 --> 00:32:32,692
Who?

604
00:32:32,678 --> 00:32:34,843
That's what she looks like?
Excellent.

605
00:32:34,989 --> 00:32:35,705
Shh!

606
00:32:37,078 --> 00:32:39,635
Joe... the girls...

607
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,362
The mad dash to get everyone out of the house...

608
00:32:45,635 --> 00:32:46,533
to work...

609
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:48,008
to school...

610
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:52,705
You'd think it would become routine, but it never did.

611
00:32:52,862 --> 00:32:55,202
It was always chaos, and...

612
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:58,706
it was always wonderful.

613
00:32:59,275 --> 00:33:04,005
So, you're a woman from the future trapped in the year 1959.

614
00:33:04,762 --> 00:33:07,387
Is that honestly what you expect me to believe?

615
00:33:08,642 --> 00:33:12,716
Frankly, Doctor, it doesn't matter what you believe.

616
00:33:16,735 --> 00:33:18,625
It only matters what she believes.

617
00:33:20,303 --> 00:33:22,155
She's the only one that matters.

618
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:30,164
What the hell does that mean?

619
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:51,524
Hello?

620
00:33:52,245 --> 00:33:55,173
Allison, I hope I'm not calling too late, but I have news.

621
00:33:55,174 --> 00:33:57,259
News? We like news.

622
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:01,494
That series of numbers that you saw when you were speaking with Timothy Kercher?

623
00:34:01,495 --> 00:34:05,764
Turns out it is a bank account belonging to a Dr. Elaine Doyle.

624
00:34:06,237 --> 00:34:07,696
Doyle, Doyle, Doyle...

625
00:34:07,747 --> 00:34:09,412
Why do I recognize that name?

626
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:13,070
Probably because you read the same psych evaluation that I did.

627
00:34:13,192 --> 00:34:17,885
The psychiatrist who diagnosed Kercher with dissociative identity disorder.

628
00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:20,927
And would you care to guess who transferred a quarter of a million dollars

629
00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:24,833
into her bank account less than 24 hours after she made that diagnosis?

630
00:34:24,945 --> 00:34:26,620
Let me guess...

631
00:34:27,223 --> 00:34:28,352
Don't tell me.

632
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:30,438
I see the initials "T" and "K."

633
00:34:30,745 --> 00:34:33,707
The good doctor was arrested a few hours ago and admitted to everything.

634
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:37,343
It turns out that Kercher didn't just pay her for the evaluation.

635
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:39,465
He paid her to coach him--

636
00:34:39,516 --> 00:34:44,241
to teach him how to mimic the behavior of a person with dissociative identity disorder.

637
00:34:44,527 --> 00:34:45,732
Does Maggie know yet?

638
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:46,788
Yeah, I just told her.

639
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:47,669
She's furious.

640
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,879
She's on the phone with her client right now, insisting he enter a guilty plea.

641
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,007
Hopefully, we'll be able to hammer out a deal in the morning,

642
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:57,783
and she'll be able to turn her attention to taking care of herself.

643
00:34:58,875 --> 00:34:59,793
She, uh...

644
00:35:00,053 --> 00:35:01,315
just got off the phone.

645
00:35:01,316 --> 00:35:02,846
I-I guess I'll see you in the morning.

646
00:35:02,847 --> 00:35:03,530
Okay.

647
00:35:38,162 --> 00:35:40,940
Someday you'll understand all this, Carol.

648
00:35:41,282 --> 00:35:42,455
I promise!

649
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:46,102
Someday, it will all be clear.

650
00:35:50,904 --> 00:35:51,625
No!

651
00:35:51,676 --> 00:35:52,439
Beverly...

652
00:35:56,706 --> 00:35:57,633
Allison?

653
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,490
Well, that's $29.99 well spent.

654
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:18,269
She didn't kill her baby, Joe.

655
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:21,963
This thing ran on two "D" batteries, honey.
She absolutely killed it.

656
00:36:21,964 --> 00:36:23,470
Not Bridgette.
Beverly.

657
00:36:24,237 --> 00:36:27,274
She was holding a doll the night she threw herself off the bridge.

658
00:36:27,275 --> 00:36:28,328
I'm sorry.
What?

659
00:36:28,681 --> 00:36:31,886
She needed everybody to believe that Anna was dead,

660
00:36:31,937 --> 00:36:33,693
so that nobody would ever go looking for her,

661
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:36,644
so that her father could never get his hands on her.

662
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,067
She was crazy, all right.
She was crazy like a fox.

663
00:36:39,068 --> 00:36:40,718
She knew exactly what she was doing,

664
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,354
right down to being sure that she had witnesses for the big jump.

665
00:36:45,194 --> 00:36:48,032
The only thing I don't think she counted on was...

666
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:48,994
surviving it.

667
00:36:49,768 --> 00:36:52,610
But once she did, she had to stick to her story.

668
00:36:53,483 --> 00:36:55,953
She had to let the rest of the world think she'd killed her own kid,

669
00:36:55,954 --> 00:36:57,490
so that no one would try and find her.

670
00:36:57,491 --> 00:37:00,337
So, she spent the rest of her life in an institution.

671
00:37:00,338 --> 00:37:02,376
Even though she wasn't the least bit insane.

672
00:37:02,377 --> 00:37:05,126
So, maybe the reason you've been dreaming about her...

673
00:37:05,127 --> 00:37:07,792
the reason that she claimed to be you when she was in that hospital...

674
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:09,152
maybe you're supposed to...

675
00:37:09,153 --> 00:37:10,548
to help clear her name,

676
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:12,098
tell the world that she's not a killer.

677
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:13,494
No, no, no.

678
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:15,453
All Beverly ever cared about was her baby.

679
00:37:15,454 --> 00:37:18,039
All she ever wanted to do was to protect her.

680
00:37:18,845 --> 00:37:22,665
She would only be reaching out to me if-if her daughter needed help.

681
00:37:23,238 --> 00:37:27,412
The daughter she stashed away so well that no one even knew she existed for 46 years?

682
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:30,408
A woman who could be anywhere in the world right now?

683
00:37:30,478 --> 00:37:33,418
Great. Well, tracking her down should take only, what?

684
00:37:34,476 --> 00:37:36,078
Another 46 years.

685
00:37:36,317 --> 00:37:37,200
Give or take.

686
00:37:47,843 --> 00:37:48,850
Mrs. Dubois?

687
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:51,112
Mrs. Dubois?

688
00:37:51,612 --> 00:37:52,654
Over here.

689
00:37:56,652 --> 00:37:58,510
Mrs. Fulsom, are you okay?

690
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:00,215
Yeah, more or less.

691
00:38:00,216 --> 00:38:02,886
I just started feeling nauseous all of a sudden.

692
00:38:03,637 --> 00:38:04,526
Can you move?

693
00:38:05,478 --> 00:38:07,273
Probably not without throwing up.

694
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:10,096
Okay, uh, wait here.
I'll go get some help.

695
00:38:10,097 --> 00:38:11,099
No, no, no, no, no.

696
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,396
Actually, I'd rather you didn't do that.

697
00:38:13,397 --> 00:38:18,317
The last thing I want is some big scene in the garage of the District Attorney's office.

698
00:38:18,932 --> 00:38:19,850
Are you sure?

699
00:38:21,444 --> 00:38:22,751
Okay, I'll make a deal with you.

700
00:38:22,752 --> 00:38:25,567
If it doesn't pass, then you can go get somebody.

701
00:38:26,486 --> 00:38:29,609
But for now, I'd just like you to...

702
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:31,897
sit with me.

703
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:35,530
Okay.

704
00:38:47,996 --> 00:38:50,261
No, no, no, no, here.
Let me get that.

705
00:38:50,493 --> 00:38:51,524
Here, it's okay.

706
00:38:55,572 --> 00:38:57,237
What I have isn't catching...

707
00:38:57,721 --> 00:38:58,881
if you're wondering.

708
00:38:59,008 --> 00:39:00,538
No, no, I'm not wondering.

709
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,727
It's hereditary.

710
00:39:04,755 --> 00:39:07,945
I wish somebody had told me about that when I was younger.

711
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:11,306
I wouldn't have wasted so much energy being a control freak.

712
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,668
I'm sorry.

713
00:39:14,086 --> 00:39:16,306
You know what the worst part of it is?

714
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,074
I still can't spell the stupid thing.

715
00:39:20,013 --> 00:39:21,032
No, I'm serious.

716
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:25,439
If you're gonna drop dead of something, you should at least be able to spell it, right?

717
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,737
I would think so.

718
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:31,192
I feel always compelled to add the extra "L."

719
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,643
Amyloidosis:

720
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:35,725
A-m-y-l-o-i...

721
00:39:35,914 --> 00:39:37,625
d-o-s-i-s."

722
00:39:38,535 --> 00:39:40,290
It's a liver condition, right ?

723
00:39:41,107 --> 00:39:42,283
You've heard of it?

724
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:44,984
I thought that was treatable nowadays.

725
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:47,230
Nowadays.

726
00:39:48,064 --> 00:39:48,904
I just mean...

727
00:39:48,907 --> 00:39:50,716
in the past, there wasn't much a person could do,

728
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:54,363
but today, I thought you could address it with a transplant.

729
00:39:55,295 --> 00:39:56,489
It could, in theory.

730
00:39:56,966 --> 00:40:00,288
But, uh, apparently, I'm a tough tissue match.

731
00:40:01,423 --> 00:40:02,808
Well, what about your family?

732
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:05,614
A live donor could give you a partial transplant...

733
00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:09,229
I'm adopted.

734
00:40:13,176 --> 00:40:14,223
Maggie...

735
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:17,107
what year were you born?

736
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:22,420
I know it's a strange question, but I think it might be important.

737
00:40:25,812 --> 00:40:27,310
1959.

738
00:40:35,138 --> 00:40:36,589
All right, repeat after me, Bridge.

739
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,104
- No baths.
- No baths.

740
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:40,369
- No haircuts.
- No haircuts.

741
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,850
- No makeup.
- No makeup.

742
00:40:42,247 --> 00:40:44,607
Okay, you may now open your doll.

743
00:40:51,488 --> 00:40:52,558
Let's go shopping.

744
00:40:53,815 --> 00:40:57,749
You know, dear, if you just buy them new ones, they don't learn anything.

745
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,700
I know.

746
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:02,159
But if she hadn't left the old one in the tub...

747
00:41:02,386 --> 00:41:03,948
I figure I owed her one.

748
00:41:04,518 --> 00:41:08,942
So, how did that Maggie person take it when you told her that she was really Anna Waller?

749
00:41:08,943 --> 00:41:10,683
Well, she didn't believe me at first.

750
00:41:10,684 --> 00:41:13,769
Till I brought her to meet Carol Waller and her family.

751
00:41:14,692 --> 00:41:16,685
And now the Wallers have met their long-lost kin,

752
00:41:16,686 --> 00:41:21,516
I'm sure they're just lining up to give this perfect stranger a piece of their livers.

753
00:41:21,654 --> 00:41:25,955
Well, actually, three of them offered to get tested to see if they're a match.

754
00:41:25,956 --> 00:41:28,031
Yeah, but what are the chances of...?

755
00:41:28,454 --> 00:41:30,751
<i>Birds singing in the sycamore tree...</i>

756
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:33,112
They're all going to match, aren't they?

757
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:36,222
<i>Dream a little dream of me</i>

758
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:42,152
<i>Say "nighty-night" and kiss me</i>

759
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:48,650
Just hold me tight
and tell me you'll miss me

760
00:41:49,181 --> 00:41:53,795
While I'm alone and blue as can be

761
00:41:54,092 --> 00:41:58,357
Dream a little dream of me.

762
00:41:58,815 --> 00:42:00,755
Beverly, did you hear what I said?

763
00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:03,923
No.

764
00:42:05,101 --> 00:42:06,058
I'm sorry.

765
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,791
I was a million miles away.

766
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,690
I was just saying I think we've made a great deal of progress today.

767
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:16,246
I agree, Doctor.

768
00:42:18,399 --> 00:42:19,834
A great deal of progress.

769
00:42:25,806 --> 00:42:30,701
