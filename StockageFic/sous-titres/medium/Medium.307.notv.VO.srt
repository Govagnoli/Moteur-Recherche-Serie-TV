26
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,490
That shows too much booby.

27
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,470
What? It does.

28
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,440
Mom would never let you wear that.

29
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,720
I told you,I don't want that one,I'm looking for something special.

30
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,760
Good morning,my tribe.Who wants pancakes?

31
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,430
Me! Me,too.

32
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,220
What's the occasion?

33
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,860
It's a lazy Sunday morning,and I feel like making pancakes.

34
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,850
JOE: Well,suddenly,I feel like making bacon.

35
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,760
ARIEL: That's it!I found my dress.

36
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,690
What dress?

37
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,860
That I'm going to wear to the Spring Fling.

38
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,350
Isn't it beautiful?Isn't it just to die?

39
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,330
It is. That is just to die.

40
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,430
But I thought you weren't going to the dance.

41
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,150
I thought Wyatt Forrester asked Crystal Beckman and you'd sworn off dances forever.

42
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,230
What could have possibly changed between now and last night?

43
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,050
She had a dream.

44
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,900
No kidding.

45
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,670
What do you mean?What kind of dream?

46
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,850
I dreamed that Wyatt and I were at the dance,

47
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,270
and I was wearing this dress,

48
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,910
and we talked and drank punch and had the best time.

49
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,650
And then... when they announced king and queen,it was Wyatt and me.

50
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,050
And we got on the stage,and somebody handed me a big bouquet of flowers,and put a crown on my head.

51
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,940
And buckets of rose petals fell from the ceiling.

52
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,940
We were covered in them.

53
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,530
It was so magical.

54
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,040
Well,that sounds like a lovely dream,sweetheart.

55
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,280
Okay,pancake time.

56
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,830
Wait!

57
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,770
See,when I woke up,

58
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,000
it didn't feel like a regular dream.

59
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,120
It felt like one of those dreams.

60
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,710
You know... special.

61
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,680
And now,I think maybe Wyatt's going to ask me to the dance,

62
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,150
and after all,I need to be ready,

63
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,550
and I need to have this dress.

64
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,650
Okay,Ariel-- and I'm not saying you are--but what if you're mistaken about this dream?

65
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,090
What if Wyatt doesn't ask you to the dance?

66
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,780
That looks like a pretty expensive dress to just have hanging unworn in your closet,sweetheart.

67
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,770
But... if I don't go,we can take it back.

68
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,690
And can't we just look at the dress,just in case?

69
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,290
And it says in the ad it's at Your Perfect Day Bridal Salon,

70
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,270
and that's right next to Fashion Square.

71
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,060
-Okaywe'll go look. -Now?

72
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,640
-Now,I'm making pancakes. -But suppose someone goes in and buys it.

73
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,250
I'll take you to see it right after breakfast.

74
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,970
-But,Mom-- -Zip. Sit.

75
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,900
Go. Now.

76
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,030
Really,Mom,don't you think it's the prettiest dress ever?

77
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,070
It's the prettiest ever.

78
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,170
Before you get too attached,how much?

79
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,610
Only...

80
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,840
$148.

81
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,640
Great,well,you can wear it to every dance you ever attend,

82
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,170
then you can pass it on to Bridgette,then Marie,

83
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,870
and then I'll be buried in it.

84
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,410
Thanks,Mom.

85
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,330
I'm going to go try it on.

86
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,380
Hello?

87
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,620
Hello?

88
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,710
Hello?

89
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,080
Is anyone back there?

90
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,660
I have an eager 13-year-old ready to take that little pink chiffon number off your hands.

91
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,950
Hello?

92
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,450
Oh,my...

93
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,430
Mom,where are you?It fits perfectly!

94
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,270
Ariel!

95
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,700
-Ariel,stay where you are. -Mom!

96
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,660
Come with me. Mom,what are you doing?

97
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,020
Ariel,you said that the front door was open,right?

98
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,560
We just went right in.

99
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,510
The door to the back of the shop was open,too.

100
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,020
Do you know who they are yet?

101
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,110
Patty and Claire Chase,mother and daughter.

102
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,360
Patty owned the shop,and according to nearby merchants,

103
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,170
Claire used to help out afternoons and weekends.

104
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,970
Last night,we're thinking right around closing time,

105
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,220
someone came in and shot them both.

106
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,520
Was it a robbery?

107
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,930
No money was taken from the cash register.

108
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,210
Nothing else was disturbed.

109
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,570
Looks like the whole point was just to kill these two women.

110
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,870
Those were the two dead bodies they were taking out of there,weren't they?

111
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,530
The woman who owned the shop,and her daughter.

112
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,420
And they were shot?

113
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,900
Ariel...

114
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,020
Why can't I know?

115
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,910
Yes,they were shot.

116
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,490
How old was she?

117
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,820
The girl,I mean.

118
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,870
Fourteen.

119
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,290
Come in.

120
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,930
Hey,kiddo.

121
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,910
Hi,sweetie.

122
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,720
-Mom... -Yes,sweetie?

123
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,170
What am I supposed to do with the dress?

124
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,300
I mean,I can't keep it or anything.

125
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,480
I don't want to,obviously.

126
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,470
And we didn't pay for it,so...

127
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,960
I'll take it to work with me tomorrow.Someone there will figure out how we should handle it.

128
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,700
Good night.

129
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,400
Good night.

130
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,400
Good night,honey.

131
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,180
So I guess she's holding up all right.

132
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,930
How about you?

133
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,930
I'm a mess.Can't you tell?

134
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,320
Here's what I keep telling myself:

135
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,580
Ariel didn't see the bodies in that room.

136
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,950
She didn't see any of the blood.I just keep telling myself

137
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,380
maybe without all those terrible images in her head,

138
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,800
she'll put all this behind her quicker than we think.

139
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,020
At least that's what I keep telling myself.

140
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,100
So what about you?

141
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,410
Do you still have those images in your head?

142
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,340
Unfortunately,my head is so crammed with terrible images,

143
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,900
I feel like I should open a library and start lending them out.

144
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,970
I'll be okay.

145
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,640
If she's okay,I'm okay.

146
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,620
Bad dream?

147
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,240
Just more terrible images for the lending library in my head.

148
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,180
Mom,open the door!

149
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,840
Mom!

150
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,950
Mom!

151
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,620
Mom...!

152
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,300
Hey,darlin'.

153
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,380
You're up early.

154
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,860
I guess.

155
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,680
What are you working on?

156
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,010
History.

157
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,740
I've got a test on Friday.

158
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,490
You're,uh...

159
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,790
studying on Monday for a test you have on Friday?

160
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,700
I couldn't sleep,okay?

161
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,780
Okay.

162
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,620
You want to talk about it?

163
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,590
No.

164
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,440
I was thinking of making some cinnamon toast.

165
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,680
Would you like that?

166
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,920
No,not really.

167
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,150
Well,there must be something I can make you.

168
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,070
Can you make time speed up?

169
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,600
Can you make me already be at school,laughing with my friends instead of sitting here

170
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:44,390
thinking about stuff that I really don't want to be thinking about?

171
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,440
Or even better,can you go back and make yesterday not happen?

172
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,320
No.

173
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,390
I can't do that.

174
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,120
Then I guess there's really nothing you can do for me.

175
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,530
Okay.

176
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,790
Well,if it isn't the famous Ariel Dubois.

177
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,970
Famous?What does that mean?

178
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,760
You didn't see the paper?

179
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,670
It's all over the front page.

180
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,910
The murders in that dress shop.

181
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,120
You and your mom finding the bodies.

182
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,380
My name was in the paper?

183
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,880
-Big as life. -Great.

184
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:34,560
So,was it scary?Was there a ton of blood and guts?

185
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,860
you know,it was really my mom who found them

186
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,630
and I don't really want to talk about it,if that's okay.

187
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,760
Sure,whatever.

188
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,330
So,has Wyatt finally asked you to the Spring Fling or what?

189
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,370
Why would he ask me?You already told me that he was going with Crystal.

190
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,840
Didn't you hear?They had a fight.

191
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,060
He's still looking for a date,and I hear you're number one on his list of possibles.

192
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,220
Great.I still don't have anything to wear.

193
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,770
-You better find something quick,'cause here comes Wyatt. -What?

194
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,050
Hey,Ariel.

195
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,750
Oh,hey,Wyatt.

196
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,820
-Bye,Ariel. -Hi,Wyatt.

197
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,980
You heading this way?

198
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,110
Yeah; English with Mr. Harper.

199
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,630
Oh,I had him last year.

200
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,120
Did he make you act out a scene from a famous novel yet?

201
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,940
No,not yet.

202
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,770
Um,but I think that's next month.

203
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,150
Yeah,ours was pretty funny.

204
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,570
Eric Anderson did  <i>Catcher in the Rye,</i>but he played Phoebe.

205
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,420
Are you okay?

206
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,410
What?

207
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,990
I'm fine.

208
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,180
Are you sure?

209
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,090
You seem kind of distracted.

210
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,030
No.

211
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,600
Not distracted.

212
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,510
I'm fine.

213
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,220
Well,I... I guess I better get back to class.

214
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,420
I'll see you around,okay?

215
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,510
He came in through the back door.

216
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,110
Are we talking about what I think we're talking about?

217
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,920
And I take it that this information came to you...

218
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,590
last night.

219
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:28,230
He came in through the back.He found Patty Chase crying in the sewing room.

220
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,140
Everything happened really fast.

221
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,570
Patty turned around,and he just...

222
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,920
started shooting.He just kept shooting until she was dead.

223
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,520
That pretty much corroborates what forensics told us.

224
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,240
The killer did his job and split.

225
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,980
Wasn't polite enough to stick around and leave us any useful fibers or fingerprints.

226
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,400
I'm guessing that doesn't leave us any suspects. (sighs)

227
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,790
So far,not a one.

228
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,680
Found out Claire's father,Patty's husband,died three years ago.

229
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,880
Patty's friends say she hadn't started dating again,

230
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,540
so no angry ex-husbands or boyfriends in the picture.

231
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,310
No enemies to speak of.Not a whole lot for us to work with.

232
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,100
Yeah,my mom's got me helping out today for a couple hours.

233
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,720
She's out with her "mystery man" again.

234
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,400
No,I haven't met him yet.

235
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,990
She won't even admit she's dating somebody.It's,like,whatever.

236
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,910
She's having sex.Big deal.

237
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,750
No,it's okay.

238
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:27,580
And it's,like,the only time I can get on the computer without her hanging over my shoulder,you know?

239
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,540
Hang on.Hi,can I help you?

240
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,900
Um,yeah,I'm here to pick up my wedding dress.

241
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,060
I had it altered and somebody,uh--

242
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,900
I think her name was Patty--she said I could pick it up today.

243
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,440
The name's Janet.

244
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,240
Oh,right.

245
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,090
Did you want to try it on,just to make sure it fits?

246
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,520
Um... yeah,sure,okay.

247
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,440
Okay,I'm back.

248
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:08,540
Yeah,I got three messages from Brady,but it's all real casual.I don't think he's gonna-- 

249
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,510
That weird guy is IM'ing me again.

250
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,310
He keeps saying he wants to meet me at Fashion Square and see a movie.

251
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,680
God,like I really believe he's 15.He's probably,you know,30.

252
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,260
You're crazy.

253
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,890
Okay,but if anything goes wrong  and I get in trouble with my mom,I'm totally blaming you.    

254
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:36,570
"Hey,Shred182,you sound really kewl.

255
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:42,230
"Let's meet. Food court. 4:30.See ya!"

256
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:47,570
How long do you think he'll sit there before he figures out he's been stood up?

257
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,710
Hey,I got to go.

258
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,260
You look really nice.

259
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,620
Do I?

260
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,150
Yeah,I love that dress.That's one of my favorites.

261
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,610
Really?

262
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,720
You want it?

263
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,680
Because you... you can have it.

264
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:16,190
I don't really think I'm going to need it after all.

265
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,400
The thing is,I don't...

266
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,700
I don't know how to get out of this.

267
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,610
Have any advice?Any tips you can offer on how I'm supposed to tell my fianc?

268
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,640
I'm just not that into him?

269
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,350
Because I think a fresh start is in order for me.

270
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:44,240
I think about 3,000 miles between he and I is called for,you know?

271
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,810
Starting right now.

272
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,190
That's my mom.I'm gonna go get her.

273
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,320
You do that.

274
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,310
Tell her I... I want to return the dress.

275
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,290
Mom,there is a girl out there,completely freaking.

276
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,610
She pulled off her dress and she's...

277
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,590
Mom,what happened?

278
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,800
It's okay. Don't be upset.

279
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,330
Oh,my God.

280
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,930
Did your boyfriend do that? I don't have a...

281
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,270
Don't lie to me.

282
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,210
Please.

283
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,200
Okay. I broke up with him.

284
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,290
I think this was his parting gift to me.

285
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,330
But look,he's gone now and he's not coming back,so...

286
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,790
let's just forget him.Okay?

287
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,420
Mom?

288
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,570
Can you come out here,please?

289
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,070
Can you come out here,please?

290
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,250
Mom?

291
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,200
Mom,please?

292
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,060
What's going on back there?

293
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,180
Ariel,is something the matter?

294
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,100
I'm fine. Really.

295
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,470
She won't leave me alone.

296
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,690
Who won't?

297
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,870
I'm guessing the girl who died yesterday.

298
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,700
I'm having dreams about her.

299
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:51,020
Scary,awful dreams about her murder.

300
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,960
What am I supposed to do about it?

301
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,640
I don't know.

302
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,020
I don't have a good answer to that question.

303
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,350
I've struggled with that same thing my whole life.

304
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,970
Great.

305
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,120
Her mom has this boyfriend.

306
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,080
Doesn't seem very nice.

307
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,080
I think he may have hit her once.

308
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:27,160
This is great.Honey,thank you.

309
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,000
I'll call Detective Scanlon and let him know.

310
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:34,490
-If you have any other dreams... -I don't want any more dreams.

311
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,120
I just want for all of this to go away.

312
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,300
I want a normal life.

313
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,730
I want to be normal.

314
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,080
You are normal. Right.

315
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,920
You should've never had children.

316
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,200
Not when you knew there was a chance they'd be like you.

317
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,080
All locked up.

318
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,940
Did Ariel say "good night"?

319
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,260
Just not to me.

320
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,150
She'll come around.Give her time.

321
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,650
What if she doesn't?

322
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,680
She will.

323
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,580
<i>Hey,it's me.When are you gonna be home?</i>

324
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:29,290
Okay,but come straight home after practice.No dawdling with the friends,okay?

325
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,190
Did you,uh,change your Friend Section password?

326
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:38,830
Claire,come on,we agreed you could have the page as long as I have unrestricted access.

327
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,560
The password,please.

328
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,210
Invasive? Yeah,that's cute.

329
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,600
Thank you. See you later.

330
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,860
Invasive.

331
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,360
where were you yesterday,bitch

332
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,950
Leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you.

333
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:14,740
Uh,Mr. Wallaby,uh,yes,this is Patty Chase of Your Perfect Day Bridal Salon.

334
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:19,550
I'm calling about a wedding dress that was dropped off here yesterday

335
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,090
by your fiancee,Janet.

336
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,360
(answer me,whore!)

337
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,640
You know,I-I believe she indicated to my daughter Claire,

338
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,420
that she wanted to return the dress you purchased for her,

339
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,050
but I'm afraid that won't be possible,since it's been altered.

340
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,890
Would you have her contact me,please?My number is 555-0132.

341
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,770
(I can find you.It isn't hard.I know so much about you)

342
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,040
(Shred 182 is not longer online)

343
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,460
Oh,Claire...

344
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,620
what have you done?

345
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,390
What's going on?

346
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,970
Everything okay?

347
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,800
Everything's fine.

348
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:00,080
Just... I had another dream about the bridal shop killings.

349
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,460
I didn't see the killer.

350
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,400
At least I don't think I did.

351
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,990
That's all the more reason to go back to sleep.

352
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,990
I know,seriously,she's so crazy and paranoid.

353
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,770
And she says I can't go back on to Friend Section for six months.

354
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:21,470
I told her it was all your fault,you told me to trick the guy in the first place.

355
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,100
But she didn't-- I did!

356
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,850
She didn't even care.

357
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,000
She said,"The world is full of predators and it's best not to go around trying to piss them off."

358
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,740
Ah,the magic hour.

359
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,360
Listen,I gotta close up.Can I call you later?

360
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,150
Okay. Bye.

361
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,350
Hi. Hey.

362
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,980
Uh... can you open the door,please?

363
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,880
Yeah,no-no,I know you're closed,but I'm not here to shop,uh...

364
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,350
You must be Claire,right?

365
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,910
Is your mom in there?

366
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,180
Because I-I,um... I really need to talk to her.

367
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,410
 Hey,cut that out!

368
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,370
Oh,no-no. It's okay,um...

369
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,280
Just go get your mom,all right?

370
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,510
And tell her to open the door and talk to me.

371
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,850
Huh? I know who you are,you know.

372
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,110
And she doesn't want to see you.

373
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,860
What do you mean?

374
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,190
What did she tell you?

375
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,700
(banging) Where is she?

376
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,160
No,hey!Hey,no,no,no,no.

377
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,810
Mommy,I wanted the puffy ones.

378
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,390
These are the puffy ones.

379
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,730
They're plenty puffy.

380
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,720
All right,go get the puffy ones,I'll eat these.

381
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,530
Thanks,Mommy.

382
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,390
How about you?Are you all right?

383
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,450
You happy?

384
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,030
Happy!

385
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,230
Glad to hear it.

386
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,720
Ariel...

387
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,010
I saw him.

388
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,690
I saw the killer.

389
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,770
I can't believe you think it's a good idea 

390
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,720
to bring our daughter down to the police station to work with a sketch artist.

391
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:35,680
Believe me,I'd have given anything to have had Ariel's dream.

392
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,510
But for some reason,it seems like I'm getting dreams from Patty,

393
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,210
and Ariel's getting dreams from Claire.

394
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,470
And,for some reason,I don't know,

395
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,530
it seems like they have very different ideas about who might have done it. 

396
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,740
Well,how can that be?They were both killed by the same person. 

397
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,420
I don't know,Joe.

398
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,830
Maybe because they're deaths were so sudden,so violent;

399
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,500
maybe because one or both of them didn't literally see who did it.

400
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,410
Well,that's all well and good,

401
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:04,170
but our oldest child is clearly taking no pleasure in being the go-between in all this.

402
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,140
 I know that.

403
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,840
I'll try to make it as quick and painless as possible.

404
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,600
She's not gonna be alone.I'll be with her the whole time,

405
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,220
which I'm sure will be a great comfort to her.

406
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,880
She has to forgive me sometime,right?

407
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,380
She has to.

408
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,620
He had a longer nose.

409
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,440
You know,pointier.

410
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,020
Like... Jim Carrey in that movie.

411
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,380
Longer and pointier.

412
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,990
Got it.

413
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,110
Ladies.

414
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,860
Wayne,can I steal Mrs. Dubois for a moment?

415
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,520
Go on,Mom. I'm fine.

416
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,120
Tell me this is about a lead.

417
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,870
This has to do with a lead.Two,in fact.

418
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,550
I spoke with the president of Friend Section,and as long as we have the appropriate paperwork,

419
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,990
he's willing to help us identify the person who threatened Claire Chase online.

420
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,380
We should have Shred182's name and address by the end of the day.

421
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:19,070
And this morning,we got a call from one of the merchants in Chase's strip mall about something he saw Saturday night.

422
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,860
Apparently,around 6:00,

423
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,230
he heard some tires squealing in the parking lot.

424
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:26,020
When he looked out his window,he saw a car speeding away,

425
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,790
made a note of the plate and called us.

426
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,090
The police traced the number to a man named Ben Radley.

427
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:34,330
Mr. Radley admits that he knew Patty Cse,and claims he was a good friend of her late husband's.

428
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,840
Said he took her out for a cup of coffee on Saturday,

429
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,570
but that she was alive when he left.

430
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,670
He insists he would never,ever hurt the wife of his dead friend.

431
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,070
And then I asked if he'd ever sleep with the wife of his dead friend-- things got real quiet.

432
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,190
Mr. Radley's a married man.

433
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,740
Patty's secret boyfriend.

434
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,560
You think Ariel would be up for taking a gander at the guy in person,

435
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,270
let us know if he's the man from her dream?

436
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,720
I don't know.

437
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:03,810
It would help us to at least know if we're on the right track.

438
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,270
I need to see his face.

439
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,520
That's not him.

440
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,110
No,I'm not discouraged.

441
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,520
All right,tomorrow then.

442
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,230
Bridge,honey,it's time for bed.

443
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,370
Okay,Mommy.

444
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,510
So what was that?

445
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,510
Claire's online stalker.

446
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,740
Turned out to be a 15-year-old kid

447
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,540
who had an alibi for Saturday night.

448
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:54,990
And apparently,Patty's married boyfriend has never owned a firearm.

449
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,570
So we're back at square one.

450
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:02,200
Can you tell Ariel it's time for bed?Last time I knocked,she told me to go away.

451
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,490
Mmm,she's upset.

452
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,710
I know she's upset.She's upset,I'm upset.

453
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,200
It's been a lousy week.

454
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,520
Can you please just tell her?

455
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,080
Who is it?

456
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,910
It's Dad.

457
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,870
Oh. Come in.

458
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,640
Your mom wanted me to tell you it's time for bed.

459
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,470
Gee,I can't wait.

460
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:35,230
Oh,boy,maybe I'll have another scary dream about killers who don't exist.

461
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,590
Yeah,you might.

462
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,480
But then you're going to wake up,calm yourself down,

463
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,680
because you know that it's just a dream,

464
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,230
and you're going to be okay.

465
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,840
And after that you're going to go the bathroom,and you're going to brush your beautiful blonde hair,

466
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:55,100
which,along with this propensity for bad dreams,you also got from your mother.

467
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,820
And then,when you're through with that,you're going to go to school,

468
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:05,560
where you're going to apply your natural inquisitiveness to whatever is happening in that classroom.

469
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:10,370
And when you do that,I want you to keep in mind that that comes from your mom,too.

470
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:14,550
But listen,it doesn't matter what I say.

471
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,360
You're going to do whatever you're going to do,

472
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,550
and you're going to feel whatever you're going to feel.

473
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,210
You're going to stay mad at your mom

474
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,340
for as long as you feel like staying mad at your mom.

475
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,250
And you know how I know that?

476
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,810
Because that's pure Mom,too.

477
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,370
It's all the same bundle,honey.

478
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:35,890
It's all in the same wonderful bundle.

479
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,210
Give me a kiss.

480
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,420
Good night,Daddy.

481
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
Good night,sweetheart.

482
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,710
I don't know.She just locked the door.

483
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,360
She's back there with someone.I think it's her boyfriend,

484
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:14,460
who she told me she dumped two days ago.

485
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,150
I... I don't want this,Ben.

486
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,120
I got to call you back.

487
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,920
Mom?Are you okay?

488
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,030
I'm fine,honey.

489
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,090
I'll... I'll just be a second.

490
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,130
I want you to have it.

491
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,850
My daughter is working,and you shouldn't be here.

492
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,540
I'm gonna leave,Alana.

493
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,590
I know I said that before,but I'm serious this time.

494
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,940
We can be together.We can go out in public.

495
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,970
No.Now,I have said this before.

496
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,850
This... what... this thing-- us--

497
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:48,490
it's-it's-it's an indiscretion,it's-it's a lapse of judgment.

498
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:51,270
It was never going to be permanent.

499
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,060
Ben... I don't want you to leave your family.

500
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,760
And I don't want this.

501
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,780
What about what I want?

502
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,260
Mom,open the door!

503
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,100
Open the door!

504
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,660
Claire.

505
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,510
I'm okay,honey.

506
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,080
You just watch the store.

507
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,190
Claire.

508
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,690
Have you got a minute to talk to me?I mean,you're not closing up or anything,right?

509
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,870
Yeah,we're still open.

510
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,820
I'm sorry about yesterday.I thought you were someone else.

511
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,800
No,no,it's fine,um...

512
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,580
I wanted to talk to you about my fiancee.

513
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,390
She,she,uh,she came in here on Wednesday and she returned a dress,

514
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:42,120
a wedding dress.

515
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,880
She was going to wear it to our wedding,tonight,

516
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,610
in fact.we were going to be married... tonight.

517
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,170
Do you remember that dress?

518
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,200
Kind of.Yeah,sure.

519
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,770
Well,see,you know,the thing is,Claire,

520
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,360
that means you've seen my fiancee more recently than I have.

521
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,700
See,she left my place on Tuesday night,and I haven't heard from her since.

522
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,300
And her mother,her mother's not telling me anything.

523
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,890
So the only thing that I know for sure,

524
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,310
is that this is the last place she visited right here:

525
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:14,000
Your Perfect... Day

526
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,990
Dress Shop.

527
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:20,830
Oh,I like it-- you know,the name and everything.It's-it's cute,it's uh...

528
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,500
charming,but I've got to tell you,

529
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,680
I don't think it fits right now.

530
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,340
Because my day has been anything but perfect.

531
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,120
In fact,my day has pretty much sucked,just like yesterday.

532
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,390
Monday pretty much bit,and tomorrow's not looking good either.

533
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,960
I don't know what to tell you.

534
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,890
I only talked to her for,like,a minute.

535
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:45,240
Well,a lot can happen in a minute,though,right?

536
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:50,940
What I want to know,Claire,is when you were helping my fiancee,

537
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,630
did she give you a hint,

538
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,750
a clue as to where she might have been headed?

539
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:02,630
No,I'm sorry,she just dropped off the dress and left.

540
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:11,240
Did she happen to mention why she decided to end a three-year relationship without so much as a phone call?

541
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,270
Nothing? Nothing at all? No hint.

542
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,820
No. Maybe you scared her.

543
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:21,850
Or maybe she just figured she'd filally bled me dry.

544
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:28,140
You can't take blood from a stone,Claire.Are you familiar with that expression?

545
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,670
Damn it,that's my car!

546
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,890
Hey! Hey,stop!That's my car!

547
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:54,100
Mom! You better come out here!This guy is completely losing it!

548
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,400
You,hey! Did you see what happened?

549
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:59,330
Hey,lady,did you get a license plate number?

550
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,520
Mom!

551
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,090
Oh,my God,Mom?

552
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,130
Mom! Mom!

553
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,590
Mom! Mom! Open the door!

554
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,970
Please.Mom!

555
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:39,160
Please,don't.

556
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,320
Mom.

557
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:07,220
So let me get this straight.

558
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:10,280
You were both wrong,and you were both right?

559
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,500
Well,Ariel misunderstood what Claire was trying to show her,

560
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,500
just like I misunderstood what Patty was trying to show me.

561
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:21,010
The dreams they were sending us weren't about the boyfriend or the guy on the Internet.

562
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:24,140
They were about the jilted fiancee.

563
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,650
We just didn't realize it,until we compared notes.

564
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,120
Got it.

565
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,570
I think.Each of you is only getting half the story.

566
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,720
If anyone wants the whole story,I've got Mr. Wallaby in the interrogation room.

567
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,480
I know what he looks like.I can do this without you,if you like.

568
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:41,320
No,I want to be there.

569
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,710
That's him.

570
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,160
That's him.

571
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,110
Okay.

572
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,880
Claire?

573
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,530
Wait!

574
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,580
Hey,there.

575
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,490
Oh,Wyatt.

576
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,230
I was...

577
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,060
looking for someone.

578
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,650
That's funny,'cause I was looking for you.

579
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,010
You were?

580
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,830
Well,I was wondering if you wanted to go to the Spring Fling with me.

581
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,720
I know it's kind of last minute,and if you say no,it's okay.

582
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,480
No. I mean,s.

583
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:50,070
It's just... I don't have anything to wear.

584
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,530
Well,wear what you have on.

585
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,960
You look great.

586
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,230
So,it's a date,right?

587
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,290
It's a date.

588
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,470
Cool.

589
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,280
Ladies and gentlemen,the king and queen of the Bates Middle School Spring Fling--

590
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:21,500
I give you Wyatt Forrester and Ariel Dubois.

591
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,570
You okay?

592
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,690
Is she home yet?

593
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:06,030
Baby,she just left an hour and a half ago.

594
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,570
You're not worried,are you?

595
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:11,570
Mm. Not even a little bit.

596
