1
00:00:00,879 --> 00:00:03,601
Everyone who has ever lived has thoughts and experiences

2
00:00:03,647 --> 00:00:05,962
that they carry with them their entire lives.

3
00:00:06,826 --> 00:00:11,051
Most people think these thoughts and experiences die with the person when they pass on.

4
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:14,322
But I believe there are certain individuals who are especially sensitive

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,505
to the thoughts of the living and the dead.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,430
Now if you buy into my theory,

7
00:00:21,582 --> 00:00:25,448
that means there's a kind of collective consciousness out there,

8
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:30,180
a kind of giant filing cabinet filled with all the thoughts of everyone

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,457
who has ever lived just floating around

10
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,762
waiting to be received by someone.

11
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:46,240
And the challenge for people like me

12
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:47,935
would seem to be

13
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:50,990
how do you sort through the din?

14
00:00:51,255 --> 00:00:54,673
How do you know which of the millions of voices to listen to?

15
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,428
Normally it's not a problem.

16
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,194
I hear one voice at a time,

17
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:01,361
see one vision at a time.

18
00:01:01,836 --> 00:01:03,848
And whatever I'm hearing or seeing

19
00:01:04,668 --> 00:01:07,955
is usually being shown to me for some important reason--

20
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,704
a crime, a missing person,

21
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:12,845
a crisis of the heart.

22
00:01:13,925 --> 00:01:18,456
Except when I get sick, and I start taking medicine.

23
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,545
Then there's no telling whose head I'm going to pop into or out of.

24
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:24,877
Off with her head.

25
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:27,728
Down with Versailles.

26
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:30,498
Let her eat cake.

27
00:01:30,677 --> 00:01:33,960
Ungrateful bastards. Have you actually tried cake?

28
00:01:34,164 --> 00:01:37,652
It's not like I said, "Let them eat brussels sprouts."

29
00:01:40,544 --> 00:01:41,625
What's going on?

30
00:01:42,318 --> 00:01:43,335
You okay?

31
00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:47,517
Yeah, I'm okay. I just have a sore throat.

32
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,296
Say "donuts" again. Say "donuts" again.

33
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:39,388
Dodut. Dodut, dodut, dodut.

34
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,081
What are you doing out of bed?

35
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:44,094
I'm standing. It's good.

36
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:45,901
When I was laying there, I couldn't breathe.

37
00:02:46,193 --> 00:02:49,485
The alarm goes off, I pour cereal. It's Pavlovian.

38
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:52,342
You still have a temperature. Did you take your medicine yet?

39
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,998
I don't like it. It makes me sleepy, and then I have weird dreams.

40
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,830
Really? You? How can you tell?

41
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:02,219
You know, you don't take your medicine,

42
00:03:02,884 --> 00:03:04,768
you're never going to shake this thing.

43
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,912
I know. Believe me, once everyone's fed and out of here,

44
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:10,294
I am going to park myself on that couch,

45
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:12,735
have lots of fluids and watch lots of TV.

46
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:14,134
And take your medicine.

47
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,033
And take my medicine.

48
00:03:27,352 --> 00:03:31,357
Up next on TV Time Capsule, it's I Married A Mind Reader

49
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:35,929
starring real-life husband and wife Abigail Marsh and Henry Stoller.

50
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:40,911
Oh, my gosh.

51
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:49,364
Oh, Henry.

52
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:51,648
You're home early.

53
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,969
Happy Anniversary.

54
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:55,389
And here I was starting to think you'd forgotten.

55
00:03:55,513 --> 00:03:56,921
Me? Never.

56
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,155
Go ahead, open it.

57
00:03:59,997 --> 00:04:03,495
Oh, Henry, they're beautiful.

58
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:04,693
Aren't they though?

59
00:04:04,797 --> 00:04:06,445
Real imitation pearls.

60
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:09,629
Saved myself a bundle and she'll never know the difference.

61
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:14,171
Henry, you shouldn't have.

62
00:04:14,382 --> 00:04:16,346
You can say that again.

63
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:19,536
Only the best for you, honey.

64
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:22,398
- Let's try them on.
- Yeah.

65
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:27,513
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

66
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,968
Hey, Me.

67
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:32,561
Listen, I just spoke to the Perellis and Valerie said I could drop the girls off with her

68
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:34,426
after school so you can get a break.

69
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:36,499
No, it's okay, you don't have to.

70
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:38,855
Um, it's done, so thank me later.

71
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,276
Um, what are you doing? Resting, I hope.

72
00:04:41,388 --> 00:04:42,886
Absolutely.

73
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:45,485
You're not going to believe what I just stumbled across--

74
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:49,746
this show I used to love when I was a kid, I Married a Mind Reader.

75
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,434
You're kidding, there's a show like that?

76
00:04:51,547 --> 00:04:53,406
I'm suing for invasion of privacy.

77
00:04:53,488 --> 00:04:57,205
Come on, you never heard of it? It's an old show from the '60s.

78
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:01,214
It starred Abigail Marsh and Henry Stoller?

79
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:03,179
You know, they were married in real life.

80
00:05:04,614 --> 00:05:05,750
Hey.

81
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:08,326
Okay, I've heard of it, I guess.

82
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:11,951
Um, wasn't that, like, years before you were born?

83
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:13,281
I used to watch the reruns.

84
00:05:13,369 --> 00:05:15,913
They haven't shown them in years. I guess because of the scandal.

85
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,733
Oh, okay, I'll ask-- What scandal?

86
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,176
Henry Stoller, the husband?

87
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:26,311
At the height of the show's popularity, he shot his wife to death.

88
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:27,966
I'll bet that hurt the comedy.

89
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:32,774
Okay. I can hear how bored you are, but this is serious.

90
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,558
Until I found out that he killed his wife,

91
00:05:35,698 --> 00:05:38,558
I had the biggest crush on him.

92
00:05:38,656 --> 00:05:41,196
Oh, well, who am I to stand in the way of true love?

93
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:44,028
I'll just let you two get reacquainted.

94
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:47,493
Oh, it's so nice to have a husband who understands.

95
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:49,874
All right. Say "hi" to Henry for me.

96
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:53,366
What do you know? He says "hi" back.

97
00:05:57,995 --> 00:05:59,515
Oh, honey, you look beautiful.

98
00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:01,184
So tell me, where did you get them?

99
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:03,591
Why Tiffany's, of course.

100
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:05,895
They'll need to be insured.

101
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:09,224
Why don't I take them into the city tomorrow and have them appraised?

102
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:12,285
Oh, boy, my goose is cooked now.

103
00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:14,953
Tell you what.

104
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:18,046
Why don't I do it, save you the trip?

105
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,057
I'm sorry, give me that again.

106
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:27,957
You know what?

107
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,796
Why don't I do it, save you the trip?

108
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:31,434
That's not it.

109
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:33,713
- What, that's not what?
- I'm lost.

110
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:35,356
- For God's sake, Abigail.
- Cut.

111
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:37,988
I need a script. Dorothy, where's my script?

112
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:40,317
Dorothy?

113
00:06:42,914 --> 00:06:44,352
Here you are, Mrs. Marsh.

114
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:46,007
Thank you, dear.

115
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:52,902
I've got it.

116
00:06:57,157 --> 00:06:58,513
From your line.

117
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:01,478
Quiet everyone.

118
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,317
And we're rolling.

119
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:05,160
And...

120
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:07,530
action.

121
00:07:07,838 --> 00:07:10,433
I'll take them in, save you a trip to the city.

122
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,313
I have a better idea, darling.

123
00:07:12,503 --> 00:07:16,380
I'll come into town for lunch and afterwards we can take them in together.

124
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,471
And cut!

125
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:22,466
Fabulous, Abby. Great work, Henry.

126
00:07:22,537 --> 00:07:24,928
All right, people, that's a wrap.

127
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,786
Damn you, Henry. You do it on purpose.

128
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,481
- What's what?
- Change the damn lines.

129
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:32,014
Oh, lover, just trying to keep things fresh.

130
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:33,535
Well, it throws me off.

131
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:35,538
Why don't we just stick to the damn script.

132
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:37,068
All right.

133
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:38,641
Come here.

134
00:07:39,481 --> 00:07:42,894
It says here it's time to go to the Dresden for drinks.

135
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:44,846
Now we're on the same page.

136
00:07:47,513 --> 00:07:48,860
Give me ten minutes.

137
00:07:52,883 --> 00:07:54,605
Why don't you come along, Dorothy?

138
00:07:54,777 --> 00:07:55,879
- Me?
- Sure.

139
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:57,179
Ever been to the Dresden?

140
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,929
No, I didn't think someone like me could even get in.

141
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,870
Well, you'll like it. It's fun.

142
00:08:02,187 --> 00:08:02,950
Okay.

143
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:03,856
Good.

144
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:06,197
You can help me with my nails in the car.

145
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:20,517
Oh, darling, did I tell you?

146
00:08:20,593 --> 00:08:23,165
The network called and asked if we'd like to participate

147
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,553
in the opening ceremonies at the New York World's Fair next year.

148
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,178
That's exciting. I heard that's going to be amazing.

149
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:33,387
Yeah.

150
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,072
I love that sort of thing.

151
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:37,425
Progress.

152
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,764
The future.

153
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:42,196
Something wrong, dear?

154
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,355
You two. You're so excited.

155
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:51,176
One of the advantages of being ever so slightly older

156
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:57,168
is that you realize that the future is nothing more than another today.

157
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:00,864
It's just that when you get there

158
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:05,785
you have more yesterdays behind you and fewer tomorrows to look forward to.

159
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,455
That's my Abigail.

160
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,058
Her glass is perpetually half empty.

161
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:18,819
There's Sean Connery.

162
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:22,265
Wow!

163
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:26,091
Boy, I'd like to be his cigarette.

164
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:29,875
Yeah, they talked to me about James Bond.

165
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:32,849
Locked into our television show. Couldn't get out.

166
00:09:34,003 --> 00:09:35,659
I wouldn't want to.

167
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:39,945
Gee, Mr. Stoller, you would've been amazing in that part.

168
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,098
Well, we'll never know.

169
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:47,599
Oh, please, you don't have to stroke his ego, Dorothy.

170
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,970
His ego, along with every other part of him, has been stroked quite enough in this lifetime.

171
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:54,865
Well, thank you for bucking me up, darling.

172
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:58,654
Now, if you two ladies will excuse me,

173
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,720
I do believe I see my agent sitting across the room.

174
00:10:02,942 --> 00:10:04,582
And he has to be nice to me.

175
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:06,441
I pay him ten percent.

176
00:10:08,352 --> 00:10:09,098
Excuse me.

177
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:18,011
Have you ever been in love, Dorothy?

178
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,400
I don't know, Mrs. Marsh.

179
00:10:22,717 --> 00:10:23,956
I guess not.

180
00:10:25,731 --> 00:10:27,632
It's the ultimate performance.

181
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:33,173
I need to visit the powder room.

182
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:34,274
Would you excuse me?

183
00:10:35,124 --> 00:10:36,510
You're excused.

184
00:10:42,651 --> 00:10:44,115
God, you scared me.

185
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:46,633
See, I remembered you like it scary. You like it dangerous.

186
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,206
- Really?
- Really.

187
00:10:54,232 --> 00:10:57,377
Come on, seriously, aren't you afraid someone will see?

188
00:10:57,576 --> 00:10:59,280
No. You?

189
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:07,914
God, I hate her. I wish she was dead.

190
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:10,365
Don't say that. America loves her.

191
00:11:10,481 --> 00:11:12,792
So what's the problem? They can love her when she's dead.

192
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:14,722
Didn't hurt Jimmy Dean's career.

193
00:11:15,193 --> 00:11:17,395
- Now you're scaring me.
- Good.

194
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:25,402
What are you doing?

195
00:11:27,124 --> 00:11:27,999
Dorothy?

196
00:11:37,007 --> 00:11:38,239
What are you doing?

197
00:11:38,976 --> 00:11:39,913
What are you doing?

198
00:11:40,508 --> 00:11:41,311
Mom...

199
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:44,250
Mom... Are you okay?

200
00:11:46,108 --> 00:11:47,178
Mommy.

201
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,673
Mom, are you okay?

202
00:11:53,844 --> 00:11:56,994
Wow. Talk about a fever.

203
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,061
What are you looking for this hour of the night?

204
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:21,108
Drugs from Canada?

205
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,564
A fast and convenient way out of credit card debt?

206
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:26,904
A thicker, longer penis?

207
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:30,033
Who's that?

208
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:33,700
My preteen crush, Henry Stoller,

209
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,679
one of the stars of I Married a Mind Reader.

210
00:12:37,617 --> 00:12:42,440
I had a torrid little scene with him this afternoon while you were picking the girls up from school.

211
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:45,316
Really? The famous wife killer?

212
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:48,731
You two got together, and he rubbed Vapo Rub on your chest?

213
00:12:49,787 --> 00:12:52,029
This guy's got to be, like, 100 by now, right?

214
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:55,843
He's 84, but it was this Henry, the young one, that I...

215
00:12:58,424 --> 00:12:59,781
You don't want to know.

216
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:04,558
Um, so what are we talking here?

217
00:13:04,762 --> 00:13:06,493
Some-Some kind of a dream?

218
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,381
Answer slowly, 'cause I want to remember this

219
00:13:09,442 --> 00:13:12,284
so that I can repeat it to a divorce lawyer in the morning.

220
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:15,975
I don't know. I was watching TV, and then next thing I knew, I worked there.

221
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:17,225
Making the show.

222
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,695
My name was Dorothy.

223
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:21,971
I told you this medicine had a strange effect on me.

224
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,223
I have a confession to make.

225
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:26,007
I had a dream once.

226
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:28,996
It was after I saw Fast Times at Ridgemont High.

227
00:13:29,161 --> 00:13:30,752
It involved Phoebe Cates.

228
00:13:31,588 --> 00:13:33,721
There. Now you know everything.

229
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:35,257
Dirty boy.

230
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:36,978
Here's the weird thing.

231
00:13:37,362 --> 00:13:39,867
You can't possibly say that with a straight face.

232
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:43,931
When I was on that I Married a Mind Reader Web site,

233
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:49,347
I looked at the credits for the show, and it said "Assistant to Mrs. Marsh, Dorothy Graybridge."

234
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:52,829
Dorothy. That's who I was. Dorothy Graybridge.

235
00:13:52,907 --> 00:13:54,897
I didn't make her up. She's a real person.

236
00:13:54,985 --> 00:13:57,955
Okay. So obviously, you saw her name on the credits of the show,

237
00:13:58,047 --> 00:13:59,679
and it stuck in your subconscious and...

238
00:13:59,753 --> 00:14:02,307
I don't think so. I don't remember seeing the credits.

239
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,125
Okay. So, what's your explanation?

240
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:07,841
You had an imaginary hot time swapping phlegm with a guy you've never met,

241
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:09,735
but had a thing for since you were 12.

242
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:11,452
Where are you going with this, Allison?

243
00:14:12,992 --> 00:14:14,037
You're right.

244
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:18,697
I don't know.

245
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:21,087
You're right, you're right.

246
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,262
I think you're right.

247
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:24,466
Say banana.

248
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:27,909
Badana, badana, badana.

249
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:30,820
I mean, why can't I have a dream that's just a dream?

250
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:32,719
Why does everything have to mean something?

251
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:33,658
There you go.

252
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:34,716
Say toothpaste.

253
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:40,205
Doothpaste, doothpaste, doothpaste.

254
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:43,903
Yeah. I think that's what it was. It was just a dream.

255
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,406
Just some crazy, hot kind of dream.

256
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:48,658
Did you have a bad dream, Mom?

257
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,358
No. I'm just taking this medication.

258
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:55,693
Say toilet paper.

259
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:58,760
Stop it! That is totally obnoxious.

260
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:00,035
You're obnoxious.

261
00:15:00,822 --> 00:15:02,943
Why? Cause I said toilet paper?

262
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:04,742
Toilet paper's not bad.

263
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:06,716
It's natural. Right, Mommy?

264
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:09,400
- Dad?
- Okay. Enough about toilet paper.

265
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,562
Okay? I'm driving you guys to school again today, so, let's wash up and get going.

266
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:16,630
The only thing is that Dorothy thing.

267
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:17,778
I explained that.

268
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:21,953
Right. Saw it, retained it, used it in my dream.

269
00:15:32,852 --> 00:15:35,466
Thanks so much for helping me with this, Marilyn.

270
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:38,609
I've always wanted to throw a surprise party for Abigail.

271
00:15:40,668 --> 00:15:42,813
The ballroom at the Roosevelt Hotel?

272
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:45,000
Well, that sounds like a fine idea.

273
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,644
Why don't we meet there in half an hour and have a look?

274
00:15:48,988 --> 00:15:51,798
I'm just going to dash off and do a few errands.

275
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:53,924
Be back in a couple of hours.

276
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,270
All right, dear.

277
00:15:55,942 --> 00:16:00,478
Perfect! I can spend an hour with Marilyn at the hotel, and she won't even know I was gone!

278
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,665
So, what is it you're doing today, darling?

279
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:11,389
Oh, it's so, uh, beautiful out, I-I thought I might go hit a bucket of balls.

280
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,393
Aha. That sounds like a fine idea.

281
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:16,109
Give me that again, Abby.

282
00:16:16,201 --> 00:16:18,500
This time, uh, play it a little more hurt.

283
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,940
You know what? I'd really rather not.

284
00:16:26,478 --> 00:16:28,776
Did I not give you the right line, darling?

285
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:30,865
You're always giving me a line, Henry.

286
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:32,939
Is there anything I can do, Mrs. Marsh?

287
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,214
Is there anything you can't?

288
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:39,558
I guess I'm not feeling very well.

289
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,969
If you have what you need, I'd really like to go home.

290
00:16:43,062 --> 00:16:45,047
Of course, Mrs. Marsh.

291
00:16:45,728 --> 00:16:46,952
That's a wrap.

292
00:16:48,003 --> 00:16:49,704
Would you like me to drive you, dear?

293
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:51,006
I'll be fine.

294
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,686
That's why we have a driver, darling.

295
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:55,109
I'll gather your things and meet you in the limo, Mrs. Marsh.

296
00:16:55,185 --> 00:16:57,582
That won't be necessary. I'm gonna go home and rest.

297
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:01,883
Perhaps Mr. Stoller could use a hand this afternoon.

298
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:10,029
Actually, Dorothy, why don't you come by the house tonight around 7:00?

299
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,142
You and I can run lines together.

300
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:16,075
Of course, Mrs. Marsh. 7:00.

301
00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:34,345
I just know, she knows.

302
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:35,880
Okay.

303
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:39,239
Come on, let's get this over with.

304
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:41,107
I'm sorry.

305
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:43,094
I can't do it.

306
00:17:43,554 --> 00:17:44,799
I can't go in there.

307
00:17:44,926 --> 00:17:47,646
I know it has to be done. I know there's no other way, but I...

308
00:17:47,744 --> 00:17:49,284
I-I can't be there.

309
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,644
I can't do it with you.

310
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:54,225
But you want this, too, right?

311
00:17:54,578 --> 00:17:56,709
You're the one who said that she was a monster.

312
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,169
Yeah.

313
00:17:57,225 --> 00:17:59,780
You're the one who said that she and the show are holding you back.

314
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:00,696
Yeah.

315
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,393
You're the one who said that your future was with me.

316
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:06,201
Yeah, all that's true...

317
00:18:09,186 --> 00:18:10,272
but I can't.

318
00:18:13,753 --> 00:18:16,215
Well then, I'll just have to do it myself.

319
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:20,799
- Hi.
- Good Morning.

320
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:23,309
Hey, I didn't expect to see you today. I heard you weren't feeling well.

321
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:26,386
I'm feeling much better, thanks. I really need to see him.

322
00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:30,042
You killed her?

323
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:31,209
Well, not me.

324
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:32,741
Dorothy.

325
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:38,377
Dorothy Graybridge. The woman that I was being in my dream or my vision or whatever.

326
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,744
I see.

327
00:19:40,277 --> 00:19:42,914
And... why do I care?

328
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:44,440
You sound like my husband.

329
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:45,981
I'm sorry. I don't mean to offend you.

330
00:19:46,058 --> 00:19:48,934
And there's no one who believes in getting to the truth more than I do,

331
00:19:48,996 --> 00:19:51,301
but you're talking over 40 years ago.

332
00:19:51,377 --> 00:19:52,928
All these people could well be dead.

333
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,356
And I don't hear a hue and cry to reopen this case,

334
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,577
and I'm guessing this all took place in California.

335
00:19:58,653 --> 00:20:00,717
I'm not even licensed to practice law in California.

336
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:01,741
I know that.

337
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:06,127
But if you could just get someone to see if these people are alive.

338
00:20:06,262 --> 00:20:08,183
Dorothy or Henry.

339
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,486
I would really like to see them.

340
00:20:11,331 --> 00:20:12,154
California?

341
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,792
You're going to California?

342
00:20:13,885 --> 00:20:15,769
Well, they haven't found Dorothy yet, but it turns out

343
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,353
that Henry Stoller is still alive and he's in prison there.

344
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:22,927
And Devalos pulled some strings and arranged for me to meet with him tomorrow.

345
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:26,305
Great. Maybe you could bring along one of your old stuffed animals, and you can get him to sign it for you.

346
00:20:26,352 --> 00:20:28,175
- That's not nice.
- Good. It wasn't meant to be.

347
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:30,556
The guy's been in prison for the last 40 years.

348
00:20:30,626 --> 00:20:33,857
Hey, I've been taking the kids back and forth to school all week.

349
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,502
- Oh, so that's what this is?
- I didn't kill anyone.

350
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,427
Joe is feeling tired.

351
00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:39,726
That came out the wrong way. What I meant to say was...

352
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:41,507
- You pick them up from school.
- ...you just got over being sick...

353
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:43,321
- Valerie's gets them from there.
- If, in fact, you're really over it.

354
00:20:43,397 --> 00:20:46,086
- Then you swing by and pick them up...
- She has a long way to go.

355
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:47,795
- ...when you're coming back from work.
- It's an awful lot of trouble to go to...

356
00:20:47,862 --> 00:20:50,657
...make sure Ariel does her math homework, give Marie her ear drops...

357
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:52,295
- ...reaction to some bad medication...?
- You know what,

358
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:56,509
if you did this every day for the next five years we still wouldn't be even.

359
00:21:02,018 --> 00:21:03,560
What am I doing? If you have to go, you have to go.

360
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:04,973
Thank you.

361
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,213
Hey, if your boss thinks this is worthy of a plane trip and a hotel room...

362
00:21:08,377 --> 00:21:10,738
- Actually, he's not paying for it.
- Excuse me?

363
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,846
It's not official business. It didn't even happen in the state of Arizona.

364
00:21:13,912 --> 00:21:16,345
Wait a second, who's paying for the ticket? Who's paying for the hotel?

365
00:21:17,748 --> 00:21:18,690
We are.

366
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:23,144
I'm using some of the money that I've been making.

367
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:29,708
That's my cab. Could you get the girls so I could say good-bye to them please?

368
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:42,954
I'm sorry?

369
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:45,503
You are?

370
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:48,037
Mr. Stoller... I'm Allison Dubois.

371
00:21:48,115 --> 00:21:51,053
I'm with the District Attorney's office in Phoenix, Arizona.

372
00:21:53,215 --> 00:21:54,238
Strange.

373
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,505
You look familiar.

374
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:01,257
But I don't know anyone in Arizona.

375
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:05,677
Of course, I don't know anyone anywhere anymore.

376
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,966
Thank you for meeting with me today.

377
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:13,990
I want you to know it's such an honor to meet you.

378
00:22:14,452 --> 00:22:16,556
I used to watch you on television.

379
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:20,083
They're starting to show them again, you know.

380
00:22:23,837 --> 00:22:26,537
The reason that I'm here today, is...

381
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,303
I've been investigating your wife's murder...

382
00:22:30,928 --> 00:22:34,180
and I believe there's been a gross miscarriage of justice.

383
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:37,794
With your help, I think we can reopen the case

384
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:39,514
and get to the truth.

385
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,654
Miss...

386
00:22:43,932 --> 00:22:48,618
I'm sorry, I... I just can't hold names in my head anymore.

387
00:22:49,003 --> 00:22:51,851
As much as I'd like to say that were true,

388
00:22:52,776 --> 00:22:54,690
I'm afraid it just isn't.

389
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:58,407
There's been no miscarriage of justice.

390
00:22:58,689 --> 00:23:05,038
I was properly tried, and convicted a long, long time ago.

391
00:23:05,146 --> 00:23:08,971
- I know that you confessed to her murder, but...
- What else is there to know?

392
00:23:10,343 --> 00:23:13,235
I shot my wife in cold blood.

393
00:23:14,153 --> 00:23:19,610
There's not a day goes by that I don't wish I could undo it, but I can't.

394
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,222
I'm an old man.

395
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,291
And frankly, this is not something that I wish to discuss.

396
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:30,700
Thank you for the visit,

397
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:32,784
but I...

398
00:23:33,824 --> 00:23:36,419
I'm really rather tired right now.

399
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,051
I feel like a jackass.

400
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,246
Well, unfortunately, I don't know where to buy a good jackass in California,

401
00:23:58,318 --> 00:24:00,514
so I think you're just plumb out of luck.

402
00:24:00,612 --> 00:24:01,902
Don't you do that--

403
00:24:02,096 --> 00:24:04,846
don't you be nice, don't you be funny, not when I've been so...

404
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:09,061
How did it go in Alcatraz, or Folsom, or wherever the hell it is you are?

405
00:24:09,126 --> 00:24:10,069
Oh, Joe...

406
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,475
The dream you dreamt is not the life he lived?

407
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:15,187
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

408
00:24:16,048 --> 00:24:17,348
So how are the girls?

409
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:18,756
Happy. Eating pizza.

410
00:24:18,854 --> 00:24:20,933
Pizza? What about my lasagna?

411
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,353
I'm just hazarding a guess here, but when you said 15 minutes,

412
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,476
you meant the "oven" oven, right? Not the microwave?

413
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:33,467
So, anyway, I guess I'll fly home tonight.

414
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,637
Now listen, the District Attorney's office called here

415
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,367
and they said that they found that Dorothy Graybridge you were looking for.

416
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,954
I left the adress in your hotel. So, if you wanted to stay over and maybe try and see her tomorrow.

417
00:24:43,086 --> 00:24:45,100
I got this completely under control here.

418
00:24:45,197 --> 00:24:48,058
See, there you go again-- being nice.

419
00:24:55,018 --> 00:24:56,056
May I help you?

420
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:59,916
I was wondering if it might be possible to speak with Dorothy Graybridge?

421
00:25:00,377 --> 00:25:02,415
Oh, are you family?

422
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,442
No, no, I'm more like a distant acquaintance.

423
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,487
Oh, I'm sorry, but Miss Graybridge passed away yesterday.

424
00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:11,104
She did?

425
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:13,941
I'm terribly sorry.

426
00:25:14,135 --> 00:25:16,311
If you want to leave your phone number, I could give it to the family

427
00:25:16,383 --> 00:25:17,827
and see if anyone's interested in talking to you.

428
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,510
No, no, no. I didn't really know her that way.

429
00:25:20,597 --> 00:25:23,956
I just wanted to ask her about a TV show she used to work on.

430
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:25,501
I Married a Mind Reader?

431
00:25:25,697 --> 00:25:27,165
We know all about that.

432
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:31,114
You know, she'd been in a deep coma for that past six weeks.

433
00:25:31,277 --> 00:25:34,134
But when we heard they were showing that series again,

434
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:38,010
we started to turn on her TV every afternoon and turn the volume up.

435
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:40,549
Now I don't know whether or not she could hear it,

436
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:43,504
but I'm here to tell you, her brain wave activity--

437
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:46,822
when that show was playing it spiked like crazy.

438
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:47,794
Really?

439
00:25:49,336 --> 00:25:50,375
Would you excuse me?

440
00:25:52,106 --> 00:25:53,545
I'll be back for the rest tomorrow.

441
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,041
Excuse me, sir?

442
00:26:04,155 --> 00:26:05,244
I'm sorry.

443
00:26:06,642 --> 00:26:07,778
Are you speaking to me?

444
00:26:22,937 --> 00:26:25,278
I am perplexed, young lady.

445
00:26:25,908 --> 00:26:28,120
Did we not speak yesterday?

446
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,891
What could possibly be different other than that I'm a day older.

447
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,827
I met your son.

448
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:38,349
The son that you had with Dorothy Graybridge.

449
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:41,151
He told you that?

450
00:26:43,915 --> 00:26:46,235
He told you he was my son?

451
00:26:46,823 --> 00:26:47,653
No.

452
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:53,229
In fact, it was clear to me that he has no idea that you are his father.

453
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,594
The doctor said that she died peacefully yesterday morning.

454
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:05,355
Although I'm not so sure.

455
00:27:07,611 --> 00:27:10,069
You didn't kill your wife, did you?

456
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:16,018
I didn't even know Dorothy had a gun.

457
00:27:18,145 --> 00:27:21,529
I had no idea that was in the cards.

458
00:27:23,524 --> 00:27:27,886
All I knew was that she was pregnant, and we were in love...

459
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:31,552
and she was determined to tell Abigail.

460
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,476
Okay, come on, let's get this over with.

461
00:27:37,593 --> 00:27:39,939
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

462
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:42,284
Well, then I'll just have to do it myself.

463
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:44,927
Oh, my...

464
00:28:45,471 --> 00:28:47,110
I-I-I didn't do this.

465
00:28:47,211 --> 00:28:48,619
It's not what you think.

466
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,621
What?

467
00:28:57,063 --> 00:29:00,180
I know it looks crazy. It is crazy, but...

468
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:03,554
You believe me...

469
00:29:04,614 --> 00:29:05,566
don't you?

470
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:14,537
Let's not worry about what I believe.

471
00:29:20,277 --> 00:29:22,693
Let's worry about what the police are going to believe.

472
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:25,237
What are you doing?

473
00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:27,219
Why are you doing that?

474
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:29,687
Get out of here, Dorothy.

475
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:31,530
Go somewhere.

476
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,404
Have our baby.

477
00:29:33,978 --> 00:29:36,086
What... what about us?

478
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:37,510
What about our future?

479
00:29:37,864 --> 00:29:39,830
I'm taking care of our future.

480
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:46,865
I'm going to call the police and confess.

481
00:29:49,143 --> 00:29:50,714
You just promise me one thing.

482
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,159
You'll never tell our child about any of this.

483
00:29:55,943 --> 00:29:58,052
You'll never tell our child about me...

484
00:29:59,813 --> 00:30:01,093
or any of this.

485
00:30:08,226 --> 00:30:09,644
"Just promise me...

486
00:30:10,863 --> 00:30:14,371
that you'll never tell our child about me,

487
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,474
or any of this.

488
00:30:19,106 --> 00:30:21,026
Just promise me."

489
00:30:21,533 --> 00:30:23,147
So you took the blame.

490
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,890
The only honorable thing I've done in my entire life.

491
00:30:29,964 --> 00:30:33,618
Please, I beg you--

492
00:30:35,112 --> 00:30:37,379
don't take that away from me now.

493
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:48,393
I know you.

494
00:30:48,707 --> 00:30:51,997
I'm not sure that's necessarily something you want to brag about.

495
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:53,769
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

496
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,686
For what it's worth, you sound better.

497
00:30:57,931 --> 00:30:59,841
I mean, I don't hear your cold anymore.

498
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:03,328
Yes, I seem to have stumbled upon an amazing cure.

499
00:31:03,497 --> 00:31:06,768
First, you have to investigate a murder that no one cares about,

500
00:31:06,912 --> 00:31:11,485
but you got to be sure to arrive just as the guilty party dies.

501
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:16,454
And yet, still in time for the falsely imprisoned to tell you to leave them the hell alone.

502
00:31:17,204 --> 00:31:18,991
Hey, whatever it takes.

503
00:31:21,553 --> 00:31:22,436
I missed you.

504
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:24,457
I missed you.

505
00:31:25,401 --> 00:31:26,768
Dorothy Graybridge...

506
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:30,146
She was in a coma.

507
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,626
I'm guessing she knew she was close to death.

508
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:40,781
And every day the people at the nursing home would turn on the show and play it in her room.

509
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,773
She must have carried that guilty secret her whole life.

510
00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:52,464
Hearing the show brought back memories, and me with my crazy thought antenna.

511
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:56,510
You must have just snatched it out of the air every day.

512
00:31:57,456 --> 00:31:58,983
You were watching the show,

513
00:31:59,392 --> 00:32:01,129
she was hearing the show.

514
00:32:05,004 --> 00:32:08,220
I knew what everybody looked like except Dorothy,

515
00:32:08,318 --> 00:32:10,483
so I made Dorothy look like me.

516
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,418
So what was the point?

517
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:18,860
What do you mean?

518
00:32:19,597 --> 00:32:21,481
There has to be a point.

519
00:32:21,568 --> 00:32:24,471
Whenever I see these things, it's for a reason.

520
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:26,944
But this time?

521
00:32:28,236 --> 00:32:30,897
Hey, you got me.

522
00:32:33,944 --> 00:32:35,244
You can't prove he's innocent.

523
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,697
And even if you could, he doesn't want you to.

524
00:32:38,664 --> 00:32:40,651
Maybe it's what you said last week.

525
00:32:41,444 --> 00:32:42,765
Maybe it's just a dream...

526
00:32:43,744 --> 00:32:44,670
a nightmare.

527
00:32:45,535 --> 00:32:47,624
It came to you for no particular reason at all.

528
00:33:47,577 --> 00:33:49,019
Don't do that.

529
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,309
I like that light.

530
00:33:51,758 --> 00:33:53,225
The sound is hideous.

531
00:33:53,315 --> 00:33:56,176
You keep that off, but I like that light,

532
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:57,851
that white light.

533
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,324
Switch it back on, would you?

534
00:34:05,924 --> 00:34:08,992
I heard you talking in the bedroom earlier.

535
00:34:10,225 --> 00:34:12,422
You don't look anything like her, by the way.

536
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,624
Dorothy?

537
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,174
The woman who murdered you?

538
00:34:17,778 --> 00:34:21,889
Dorothy committed any number of sins, but murder wasn't one of them.

539
00:34:22,448 --> 00:34:25,243
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

540
00:34:25,351 --> 00:34:29,641
I didn't really ask Dorothy to come over to the house that night to run lines with me.

541
00:34:31,074 --> 00:34:32,800
Look at the television.

542
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:46,190
Mrs. Marsh? It's Dorothy.

543
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:55,436
Mrs. Marsh?

544
00:34:56,655 --> 00:34:57,776
Come in, Dorothy.

545
00:35:01,953 --> 00:35:03,797
I'm sorry I didn't get up to let you in.

546
00:35:03,883 --> 00:35:06,305
I guess I'm still not feeling a hundred percent.

547
00:35:08,185 --> 00:35:11,041
Mrs. Marsh, there's something I need to talk to you about.

548
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:11,870
Oh?

549
00:35:13,684 --> 00:35:14,610
I just...

550
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:20,284
I want you to know that I genuinely appreciate the opportunity

551
00:35:20,713 --> 00:35:25,961
you've given me with this job, but something has happened.

552
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,541
Something I never could have anticipated.

553
00:35:28,634 --> 00:35:29,643
My goodness.

554
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:35,757
I mean, the last thing in the world I would want to do is hurt you, but,

555
00:35:37,283 --> 00:35:39,340
but you need to know the truth.

556
00:35:41,794 --> 00:35:43,835
The truth is, Henry and I...

557
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,942
Henry?

558
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:52,525
Henry and I have fallen in love. And...

559
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,330
And?

560
00:35:56,805 --> 00:35:58,930
And we're going to have a baby.

561
00:36:02,284 --> 00:36:03,454
I see.

562
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:05,708
Well...

563
00:36:08,103 --> 00:36:09,559
Actually, Dorothy,

564
00:36:10,517 --> 00:36:12,845
I have a confession to make--

565
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:14,992
I knew that.

566
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:24,735
Are you all right, Dorothy?

567
00:36:24,878 --> 00:36:26,174
Something the matter?

568
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:29,113
I don't know.

569
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:32,158
What is that?

570
00:36:32,681 --> 00:36:35,798
That? That's where you shot me, dear.

571
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:40,234
About three minutes before you got here.

572
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:43,817
Now you're going to shoot me again.

573
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,943
No!

574
00:36:49,056 --> 00:36:49,947
No!

575
00:36:52,214 --> 00:36:53,279
Henry!

576
00:37:01,558 --> 00:37:02,854
Henry!

577
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:10,232
I didn't do it. It's not what you think.

578
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,368
Oh, my God.

579
00:37:19,443 --> 00:37:20,589
Wait a second.

580
00:37:20,927 --> 00:37:23,196
So you want me to believe it was you?

581
00:37:24,143 --> 00:37:26,492
That you would do that to yourself?

582
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:28,673
But why?

583
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:31,737
Have you ever been in love, Mrs. Dubois?

584
00:37:31,977 --> 00:37:34,255
I am in love, Mrs. Marsh.

585
00:37:34,563 --> 00:37:36,586
But what if you were the only one?

586
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,258
What if you were in love...

587
00:37:39,913 --> 00:37:40,944
alone?

588
00:37:42,672 --> 00:37:45,848
And what if you had lymphoma and nobody knew about it?

589
00:37:45,915 --> 00:37:47,471
Not even your husband?

590
00:37:49,432 --> 00:37:51,879
I'd been seeing a doctor in Nevada.

591
00:37:52,518 --> 00:37:54,398
I didn't want anyone to know.

592
00:37:54,874 --> 00:37:57,418
Not the studios, not the network.

593
00:37:58,115 --> 00:38:00,177
There was no treatment for it...

594
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,934
back then.

595
00:38:04,413 --> 00:38:09,342
Finally, the tests came back. He gave me three months.

596
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:13,321
Three short months.

597
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:16,998
And I wanted to tell Henry.

598
00:38:17,992 --> 00:38:20,438
I was planning on it. I was.

599
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:25,770
But then when I found out about him and Dorothy...

600
00:38:26,331 --> 00:38:28,165
found out about the baby...

601
00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:34,989
I need you to do something for me, Mrs. Dubois.

602
00:38:39,126 --> 00:38:41,261
Hey, what's going on?

603
00:38:42,275 --> 00:38:44,635
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you.

604
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:48,840
I... I think I have to go back to California tomorrow.

605
00:38:56,391 --> 00:38:58,792
What am I looking at here, young lady?

606
00:38:58,978 --> 00:39:00,861
Why are you here again?!

607
00:39:02,243 --> 00:39:04,634
Those are your wife's medical records.

608
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,405
She was dying of a terminal illness.

609
00:39:08,773 --> 00:39:09,800
And this...

610
00:39:10,758 --> 00:39:14,543
is a receipt for a gun that she purchased two days before her death.

611
00:39:20,778 --> 00:39:22,433
Oh, my God...

612
00:39:25,124 --> 00:39:26,947
I had no idea.

613
00:39:28,674 --> 00:39:30,368
How did you find this?

614
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:36,180
A friend of the family's pointed me towards a safety deposit box in Nevada.

615
00:39:36,456 --> 00:39:37,576
The point is...

616
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:42,672
with this information, I'm fairly certain that we could reopen your case.

617
00:39:42,764 --> 00:39:45,560
If we can demonstrate that Abigail took her own life

618
00:39:45,662 --> 00:39:49,281
and if you're willing to recant your confession, you could go free.

619
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:52,492
I'm an old man.

620
00:39:54,255 --> 00:39:56,609
What does it matter now?

621
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,980
It may not matter to you,

622
00:39:59,393 --> 00:40:03,966
but I asked someone to come here with me to whom it will matter a great deal.

623
00:40:46,365 --> 00:40:47,435
Thank you.

624
00:40:52,043 --> 00:40:53,099
Dorothy?

625
00:40:53,979 --> 00:40:54,879
Ma'am?

626
00:40:55,442 --> 00:40:57,798
We can't have you loitering in the hallway.

627
00:40:58,233 --> 00:41:00,086
I-I was just talking to...

628
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,793
Ma'am?

629
00:41:12,023 --> 00:41:15,357
