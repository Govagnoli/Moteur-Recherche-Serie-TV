2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,730
So, according to the statement
you gave the police,

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,090
you came home from work
and she was just...

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,360
Your wife, I mean.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,280
She was just there like that?

6
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,250
Yeah.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,140
I got off at 5 : 20,

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,060
drove home.

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,240
Stopped for gas.

10
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,280
It was winter, you know ?  So...

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,010
by the time I pulled into the driveway,
it was dark.

12
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,940
That was the thing.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,270
I walked into the house
and the house was dark.

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,060
I mean, our house, never dark.

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,790
She was always turning lights on.

16
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,970
I was always shutting 'em off.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,650
Took my eyes a minute to adjust.

18
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,500
Even then...

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,360
I was just, like...

20
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,430
I saw a shape...

21
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,630
on the floor.

22
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,200
This, like, mound.

23
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,720
I thought maybe she had rolled a rug up.

24
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,830
And I got closer and I realized it was her.

25
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,790
It was my wife.

26
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,140
And I couldn't figure out

27
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,660
what she was doing there...

28
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,920
on the floor on her side.

29
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,380
I said something to her,

30
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,540
but she didn't say nothing back.

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,520
Didn't move.

32
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,520
Nothing.

33
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,680
Then I turned the light on, 
and I saw all the blood.

34
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,550
I was standing in it, actually.

35
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,730
I was standing in her blood
and I didn't even know it.

36
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,150
I'm sorry to make you...

37
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,710
to remind you.

38
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,130
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,520
It's okay.

40
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,150
You're nice to say that.

41
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,960
Your skin is so white.

42
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,200
If I took my blade and ran it from the... 
bottom of your neck to the top of your crotch,

43
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,690
the way the blood would slowly...

44
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,800
...seep out and cover your white skin...

45
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,390
Be quite a sight.

46
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,120
What's going on ?

47
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,870
You okay ?

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,830
Bob, back to you.

50
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,310
No. it was...

51
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,300
just a dream, I guess.

52
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,560
Was I in it ?

53
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,880
Were we naked ?

54
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,470
Answer the second question first.

55
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,600
You sure you're okay ?

56
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,010
I said, "I'm okay".

57
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,980
Okay.

58
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,570
Okay.

59
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,280
{\a6}It was shortly after 6 yesterday evening

60
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,940
{\a6}when her parents reported three-year-old Davina missing,

61
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,090
{\a6}apparently abducted while on a shopping trip

62
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,560
{\a6}with her family at the Greysmark Shopping Center.

63
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:08,860
Will you change the channel?

64
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,590
{\a6}Investigators are anxious to speak to Lloyd Isaacson,

65
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,400
{\a6}a security guard on duty yesterday,

66
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,910
Joe !

67
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,630
{\a6}who apparently left his post

68
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,530
Change the channel.

69
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:15,890
{\a6}and did not clock out.

70
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,960
The kids are watching.
My hands are full.

71
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,650
{\a6}Calls to the Issacson residence...

72
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,100
{\a6}...Mr. Isaacson has any prior history as a sex offender.

73
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,400
Joe, are you deaf ?

74
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,800
Change the channel.

75
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,550
{\a6}...ingredients chosen to create the perfect little girls...

76
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,230
Powerpuff Girls !

77
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,450
{\a6}...accidentally added an extra ingredient to the concoction

78
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,910
{\a6}Chemical X...

79
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,140
So last night's feature attraction

80
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,920
My Dinner with Mr. Ginsu?

81
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,980
Do you have any idea
where this strange encounter took place ?

82
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,950
{\a6}...using their ultra super powers,

83
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:46,740
{\a6}Blossom,

84
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,430
{\a6}Bubbles,

85
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,860
{\a6}and Buttercup have...

86
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,750
There was a sign
on the wall behind him.

87
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,520
It happened near here, Phoenix.

88
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,890
Somewhere in Phoenix.

89
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,740
Lights, please.

90
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,650
This is the front door to Pablo's house.

91
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,360
Here's the detail of where
Martinez shot the lock on the front door

92
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,710
to gain entry and commit the homicides.

93
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,570
Here's the bedroom where Martinez found Pablo
and began the interrogation

94
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,430
in an effort to recover the $30,000 from a drug deal
that Pablo never gave him.

95
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,940
Here's a slug of the mattress from the first time
he shot Pablo; the leg wound.

96
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,750
Whoa. Back up a second.

97
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,460
The accused fired seven shots into Pablo.

98
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,450
How do you know which was first or second
or seventh for that matter?

99
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,900
Even the crime lab can't tell us
which shot came first.

100
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,600
No. You're right.

101
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,710
It's just... a theory, I guess.

102
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,710
A theory?

103
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,310
Guy gets shot seven times.

104
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,040
The leg wound's the least consequential.

105
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,850
I guess I'm figuring he started with that 'cause he knew
it would cause a lot of pain, but wouldn't kill him.

106
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,840
It's a good way to find out
where your money is.

107
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,100
And then what?

108
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,920
Pablo tells him where to find the cash,

109
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,660
and to show his appreciation, Martinez shoots him
six more times through the heart?

110
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,730
No. He shot him once in the leg.

111
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,470
Then he went and shot the mother
who was hiding in the bathroom with her baby.

112
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:10,960
Really?

113
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,030
He shoots the guy once in the leg

114
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,610
then decides to look around and see
if there's anyone else in the house?

115
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,010
That's your theory?

116
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,620
No.

117
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,170
My theory is...

118
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,670
Martinez shoots Pablo once in the leg.

119
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,610
The sound of the gunshot

120
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,880
startles the baby and makes it cry.

121
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,320
Until that happens,

122
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,870
it doesn't even occur to Martinez
that somebody else might be in the house.

123
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,300
Meanwhile, the mother is trying
so hard to silence her baby,

124
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,450
she inadvertently smothers it.

125
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,320
By the time Martinez finds her in the bathroom,

126
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,680
she's so consumed with remorse

127
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,070
that she's begging him to end her life.

128
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,480
And that's my theory.

129
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,460
What the hell are you doing?

130
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,660
You're an intern.

131
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,710
Your job is to sort the crime scene photos
and talk us through them, not come up with theories.

132
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,380
This is a district attorney's office,
not a detective agency.

133
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,760
So you don't care what's in my head?

134
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,390
Not if it wasn't in a law book first, no.

135
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,650
"Which of the following might be
a prospective juror's reason...

136
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,630
for suppressing information
that might prejudice him or her

137
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,630
...from participating in a trial?"

138
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,540
A: The prospective juror's actual bias with regard to..."

139
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:43,190
B: The desire to avoid maligning "one's own reputation
as an objective, bias-free citizen."

140
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,310
Wow.

141
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,000
"B" is right.

142
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,300
I don't think I can be a lawyer, Joe.

143
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,470
Is this about the dreams,

144
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,330
the voices?

145
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,940
They give me pictures to sort,
and I know what happened between the pictures.

146
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,040
I just know.

147
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,250
I sit with Legal Aid cases
and they tell me their stories

148
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,250
and I'm absolutely sure when they're lying
or telling the truth.

149
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,850
I mean, I see it.

150
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,820
I see the truth.

151
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,860
I see it.

152
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,280
It's like a freakin' television show,
and the dreams...

153
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,330
Dreams are dreams. Everybody dreams.

154
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,280
Does everybody see dead people
standing around their bed?

155
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,060
I'm supposed to be an advocate.

156
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,750
I'm supposed to be objective.

157
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,300
I'm supposed to be normal.

158
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,030
You are normal.

159
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,410
I don't feel normal.

160
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,340
Law school, it's a lot of money,
a lot of work, a lot of time.

161
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,440
I'm past 30.

162
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,190
Maybe it's just not meant to be.

163
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,310
Or maybe,

164
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,680
just maybe it's nerves.

165
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,920
- You know, stress can make the mind...
- It's not stress.

166
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,940
I don't know what it is,
but it's not stress.

167
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,540
How do you know that?
You don't know that.

168
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,590
- I do.
- No, you don't.

169
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,090
Yeah.

170
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,740
Who's the scientist in the house?

171
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,050
Am I not the aerospace engineer around here?

172
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,170
Am I not the rocket scientist in the house?

173
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,290
I believe I am.

174
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:06,070
And what I would like to do is I'd like to apply
the scientific method to this particular conundrum.

175
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,060
What I'm proposing is simple.

176
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,950
Let's take all these scenarios
you've told me about

177
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,910
and let's send them
to the relevant law enforcement agency.

178
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,850
The one you had the other night where the guy confesses
to slitting his wife up the middle?

179
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,620
Let's just fax that to the Phoenix PD.
Let's see if it rings any bells.

180
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,570
I don't follow you.
What's the point of that?

181
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,320
The point is simple. I've got almost 25 of these things
in just the past two years.

182
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,470
If you're really getting messages
from the great beyond,

183
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,360
well,

184
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,650
somebody's going to get back to you.

185
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,120
But if, as I suspect,

186
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,270
these dreams,

187
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,770
these voices,

188
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,470
even the dead people in our bedroom

189
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,090
have more to do with the stress
associated with being a mother of three

190
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,840
while trying to get into law school
and work an internship at the DA's,

191
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,380
well, then let's stick to our plan.

192
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,590
You should go to law school.
You should study hard.

193
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,740
You should become a heartless,
scum-sucking attorney

194
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,680
and buy your husband expensive foreign cars.

195
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,650
Just seems like the right thing to do.

196
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,510
I love the way you put me first.

197
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,180
Excuse me.

198
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,890
Excuse me.

199
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,630
You're the intern, right?
I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name.

200
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,030
I know it begins with an "A."

201
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,330
Allison. Allison DuBois.

202
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,430
Right. Listen,
the starter just went on my car,

203
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,870
and the Chief asked me to run out to Brayenton
to interview a witness.

204
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,120
It's Balinda.

205
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,860
They just took the car.
But Andrea is here.

206
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,160
And she's offered to give me a ride.

207
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,390
Andrea, the intern.

208
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,980
I really appreciate this.

209
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,910
So who are you interviewing?

210
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,810
Some hausfrau

211
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,210
who thinks she can see the future or the past
or whatever it is those people think they see.

212
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,000
Remember the little girl who wandered off
from the shopping center about seven weeks ago?

213
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,390
Well, between you and me,
the boys in law enforcement don't have a clue

214
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,200
and the local news shows
won't talk about anything else.

215
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,480
So now we have to listen to every
Tom, Dick or harried housewife

216
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,060
with too much time on her hands
who thinks she can read tea leaves

217
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,180
or tarot cards or whatever.

218
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,500
It's the guard.

219
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,680
The security guard.

220
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,570
The one we've been looking for
for two months?

221
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,200
Yeah. We think so, too.

222
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,770
Well, don't you want to know where he is?

223
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,950
You know?

224
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,160
I saw him cross the border into Mexico...

225
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,070
with the girl.

226
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,170
"Mexico."

227
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,590
Terrific.

228
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,850
He sold her.

229
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,270
Oh, Mexico?

230
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,050
Any particular part of Mexico

231
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,090
or just...

232
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,350
"Mexico."

233
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,150
I don't know. I see it, but...

234
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,680
I know the name of the town
starts with an "F."

235
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,630
A town in Mexico that starts with "F"?

236
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,140
Eureka.
You've cracked the case.

237
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,060
Oh, great.

238
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,680
No signal.

239
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,720
All right.

240
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,200
I am going to step outside.

241
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,780
Try and call my office, get a list of Mexican cities
that begin with "F."

242
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,760
See if we can't narrow down this haystack
to something more manageable.

243
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,770
Are you with the girl or the guard?

244
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,190
- I mean, when you see these things, whose eyes...?
- The girl is dead.

245
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,960
She can't read. She's only three.

246
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,650
But she knows the letter "F."

247
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,010
I see.

248
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,160
You're talking to the dead girl.

249
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,720
No wonder I can't get a signal in here.

250
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,760
I'll be out front.

251
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,960
She's really a very good lawyer.

252
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,930
You want a beer, don't you?

253
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,260
Pardon me?

254
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,610
You don't like hearing the voices, do you?

255
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,070
The alcohol quiets 'em down for you, I bet.

256
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,930
How 'bout the dead?

257
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,860
You see the dead?
They come visit you?

258
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,070
Want you to pass on
messages to the living?

259
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,280
I have to go. I'm Ms. Alexander's ride.

260
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,440
Why are you at war with who you are?

261
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,090
Ma'am, respectfully,
I'm not at war with anybody.

262
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
I'm just a girl who wants to be a lawyer,

263
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,820
wants to do her job,
be a good wife, a good mother,

264
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,690
be like everybody else.

265
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,210
But you're not like everybody else
and you know that.

266
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,760
Even among the special, you're special.

267
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,120
They're telling me you're the best.

268
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,850
They're telling me, they've been speaking to you
since you were a little girl.

269
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,100
Showing you things.

270
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,840
You know what I'm talking about.

271
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,900
I know I have to go.

272
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,740
I'm here.

273
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,320
If you ever need to make sense out of it.

274
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,790
I'm here.

275
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,860
Sorry.

276
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,120
Sorry. I got pizza.

277
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,320
It's okay. We already did chicken.

278
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,490
It's on the table if you want some.

279
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,710
Hey, girls.

280
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,910
You went easy on Daddy, right?

281
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,810
Hey.

282
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,670
Look who's here.

283
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,540
You mad?

284
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,610
Mm-mm.

285
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,310
Okay, so what gives?

286
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,960
Texas Rangers called.

287
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,580
They read your fax.

288
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,210
They want to see you.

289
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,890
Sorry 'bout the bumpy ride.

290
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,420
There's a big storm over the Gulf of Mexico.

291
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,910
Ever been in a twin-engine prop before?

292
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,040
Ever been to Texas?

293
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,960
So, I'm guessing then that you've never worked with
the Texas Rangers before.

294
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,020
Well, trust me,

295
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,840
the fun is just beginning.

296
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,600
Holy crap.

297
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,910
Miss DuBois?

298
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,880
Miss Allison DuBois?

299
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,130
Mrs.

300
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,750
My name's Captain Kenneth Push
of the Texas Rangers.

301
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,960
I appreciate you coming over here today.

302
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,710
Did you write this?

303
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,680
My husband wrote it.

304
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,200
I told him what to say,
but he wrote it,

305
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,550
faxed it to you.

306
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,280
What you describe,

307
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,420
or what your husband describes on your behalf,

308
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,130
bares an uncanny resemblance

309
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,170
to an event that occurred here recently in Texas

310
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,270
in which a 17-year-old male abducted a six-year-old male

311
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:11,240
for what we believe to be
his personal sexual gratification.

312
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,200
We presently have the 17-year-old in custody,

313
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,580
although we have not yet recovered
the six-year-old or his remains.

314
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,990
Because the perpetrator of this act
is still technically a minor,

315
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,220
his name was never released to
the media or the general public.

316
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,090
You follow me so far?

317
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,220
I speak English,

318
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,020
and you do a passable job yourself, so yeah.

319
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,900
All right then.

320
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,160
Do you mind telling me,
if nobody knew this fella's name,

321
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,580
how it is that you mention it,

322
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,820
three times, spelled perfectly
 in that fax of yours?

323
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,790
I don't know. I just saw it.

324
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,590
It was on his mail.

325
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,790
You saw his mail?

326
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,760
Sure.

327
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,740
He was looking at it
when he first saw the boy.

328
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,540
He went out to get the mail from his mailbox,
that's when he first spotted him.

329
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,490
At least that's the way it was in my dream.

330
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,350
In your dream?

331
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,550
A dream, huh?

332
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,670
I know what's going on here, young lady. I do.

333
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,350
You work for the defense.

334
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,990
I don't know what you're talking about.

335
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,920
Oh, don't you?

336
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,980
I throw in with you,

337
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,480
I take you into my confidence,

338
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,690
year later we're sitting in a courtroom...

339
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,830
the defense puts me up on the stand.

340
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,390
"Isn't it true, Captain Push, "that a soothsayer...

341
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:48,690
"a fortune teller...

342
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,290
Hey!

343
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,490
"a mystical prognosticator of some kind
helped you assemble this case?"

344
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,400
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't work for anybody.

345
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,240
If you don't want me here,
I will happily go home.

346
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,790
Well, I'll tell you what we're going to do.

347
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,530
I'm going to show you eight crime scenes.

348
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,590
Seven of them are bogus.

349
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,000
You tell me which one's real

350
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,560
and then maybe we'll have something to talk about.

351
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,440
Maybe.

352
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,790
Something happened here, all right.

353
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,010
But I don't think it was any crime.

354
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,010
Least not where I come from.

355
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,230
What do you say we go up
and take a look around?

356
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,780
What do you say we don't?
This is not the place.

357
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,690
Nope.

358
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,900
Yeah.

359
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,740
11th floor.

360
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,080
You are wasting my time.

361
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,200
We're getting close.

362
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,990
Get off at the next exit.

363
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,670
You sure this is where you meant?

364
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,130
Looks to me like the Partridge family lives here.

365
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,530
Oh, I'm sure, and I'm sure you're sure.

366
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,120
And besides, I always thought
those Partridges were a little strange.

367
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,360
Didn't you sense a little something between David Cassidy
and Susan Dey, even if they were brother and sister?

368
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,300
Hm?

369
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,500
Excuse me.

370
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,620
Hi.

371
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,740
Hi.

372
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,410
Hey, what're you listening to?

373
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,400
It's this new band, Hanson.

374
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,190
My older brother just got me
the CD last week.

375
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,420
It's him you're here about, right?

376
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,060
It's about what he did
to that little boy,

377
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,450
isn't it?

378
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,650
Yeah.

379
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,990
This place belongs to the suspect's grandparents.

380
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,340
The suspect and his sister were put here by Social Services in 1995

381
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:47,140
after their parents were found guilty of neglect,
largely due to uncontrolled heroin addiction.

382
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,110
In 1999 the sister died.

383
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,850
Sounds to me like she had the flu,
which brought on dysentery.

384
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:58,100
She kept telling everybody she was thirsty,
but obviously, nobody was paying attention.

385
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,950
It's a sad and...

386
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,890
stupid reason to die.

387
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:04,650
Anyway,

388
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,690
this is definitely where it happened.

389
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,140
I'm sure of it.

390
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,300
The sister saw everything.

391
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,640
The dead sister?

392
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,760
Yeah.

393
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,780
Okay, game over.

394
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,810
That's it.

395
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,200
Everybody get in the vehicles.

396
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,740
- I don't understand.
- Lady,

397
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,210
I don't know who you are,
I don't know where you're getting your information,

398
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,560
but obviously, somebody is feeding you
a whole lot of classified, sensitive data...

399
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,510
- Hey, nobody's feeding me anything.
- I am a career investigator,

400
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,270
I am a career criminologist,

401
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,010
and I will not have some lawyer's stooge

402
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,800
pulling some cheap carney trick

403
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,250
make an ass out of me or the Rangers.

404
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,150
Now, I said we are out of here.

405
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,000
We are out of here!

406
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,050
Hey!

407
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,890
Don't you want to know where the body is?

408
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,370
Right here!

409
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,640
It's about three feet down!

410
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,660
Hold on!

411
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,340
Let's not get in the dirt just yet.

412
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,810
Did we not sweep this area with the dogs?

413
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,920
Yes, sir... about a month ago.

414
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,800
We had a whole truckful of
first-class bloodhounds in here.

415
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,480
They didn't smell anything.

416
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,520
I don't know what to tell you.

417
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,190
Maybe the body wasn't here then.

418
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,950
Maybe he moved the body.

419
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,200
Maybe your dogs had a cold.

420
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,230
All I know is,

421
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,780
the body is here now.

422
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,720
You know that, huh?

423
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,180
Yeah.

424
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,920
And how do you know?

425
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,730
You just get,

426
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,710
what, a feeling?

427
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,550
Like an itch or something?

428
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:10,440
Or maybe you've seen a secret, unrecovered body map
somewhere that we missed.

429
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,360
Or, hell,

430
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:18,860
maybe you're online with the folks
at www. i'm buried .com!

431
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,750
I'm talking to you!

432
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,450
No, you're yelling at me

433
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:24,440
and trying to intimidate me

434
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,520
and attempting to ridicule me.

435
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,770
And you really ought to calm down.

436
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,240
We both know that your heart
can't take this kind of agitation.

437
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,050
Let me give you something to think about.

438
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,440
If I embrace this nonsensical hunch of yours

439
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:58,410
and waste valuable public resources
by having my 30-odd men here

440
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,630
use the better part of an afternoon
digging up this yard and we don't find a body,

441
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:06,850
then I figure that makes you
an accessory after the fact...

442
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,220
aiding and abetting a child molester
by providing us with false leads.

443
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,580
And I figure that's good
for three years hard time.

444
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,980
Now...

445
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,900
you ponder that for a second,

446
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,130
and then you tell me one more time
where you think this body is.

447
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,230
You're standing on it.

448
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,260
Anyway, I'm done.

449
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,640
I want to go home now.

450
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,330
Sir...

451
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,010
we've got the men here, we've got the shovels...
what's the harm in doing a little digging?

452
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,350
What's the harm?

453
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,670
You want to know what the harm is?

454
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:08,010
You wouldn't happen to have a search warrant
on you, Sergeant, would you?

455
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,850
No, sir.

456
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,300
Go find our friend a comfortable hotel room.

457
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,620
Make sure she's got everything she needs.

458
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,980
Hey, you.

459
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,710
Tell me no other law enforcement
agencies have called.

460
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:32,870
Um, just the District Attorney's Office
wondering when they might get their intern back.

461
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,320
Oh, and, uh, your husband.

462
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,940
Ow!

463
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,450
who was wondering
when he might get his wife back.

464
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,250
- Do you hear that?
- No, go ahead, I'll hold on.

465
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,200
Mrs. DuBois.

466
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,610
I know it's late,
but I wonder if I might show you something.

467
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,050
Give me a minute.

468
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,200
I got to go.
It's Captain Happy at the door.

469
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,750
At this hour?
At your hotel room?

470
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,780
Is there something you want to tell me?
Something I need to know?

471
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:14,480
Yes. I'm leaving you for the angriest,
ugliest man on the planet.

472
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,720
Now, go to bed. I love you.

473
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,200
Something you want to show me?

474
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,290
Captain Push...

475
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,480
Went in 23 days ago.

476
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,150
I've never been so scared.

477
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,810
That doctor cracked me open like a walnut.

478
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:59,990
Told me if I didn't calm my life down,
the next time I complained of chest pains,

479
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:05,020
he wouldn't bother with a needle, thread or latex gloves,
he'd just walk me over to the autopsy room

480
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,370
and have me pick out which drawer
I want to be kept in.

481
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,730
Everybody I knew thought I was fishing up in Alberta.

482
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,360
I don't know how you found out.

483
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,280
I didn't find out; I felt it.

484
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,610
And for what it's worth,
I feel you'll be living a long time.

485
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,050
Oh.

486
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,250
Thanks.

487
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,890
Mrs. DuBois, open up!

488
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,660
Mrs. DuBois, Texas Rangers.
Are you awake?

489
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,060
Mrs. DuBois,

490
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,870
I need you to pack your bags
and come with me to the airport.

491
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,740
The eye of this storm is moving this way,

492
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,690
and if we don't get you out now,
there may not be a runway left.

493
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,450
But I don't understand.

494
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,220
It's 5 : 30 in the morning.

495
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:09,550
We're supposed to excavate a crime scene
in five hours, look for a body.

496
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,430
You don't understand, Mrs. DuBois.

497
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,560
As of now there is no body.

498
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,350
There is no crime scene.

499
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,410
It's all just gone.

500
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,380
Haven't you watched the television?

501
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,740
This storm here,

502
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,860
it's the biggest in Texas history.

503
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,270
This storm is Hurricane Allison.

504
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:52,800
You know...

505
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:57,400
there's nothing to say that when the rain stops,
it all still won't be there...

506
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,060
the body, the evidence...

507
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,630
When the rain finally stops

508
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:04,590
there'll be nothing left for the dogs to smell.
All the top soil will have washed away.

509
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:09,180
When the rain finally stops,
who knows where that little boy's body will be?

510
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,970
Carried off by animals?

511
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,570
Picked at?
Maybe eaten.

512
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,330
If there's anything left at all.

513
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,730
If anyone can find it.

514
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,030
When the rain finally stops,

515
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,560
the beast that did this

516
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,750
will be released from jail.

517
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:26,000
He'll be off to wherever it is that people like that go

518
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,470
and hide and wait for the next
helpless child to suck the life out of.

519
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:34,400
You know, you are not responsible
for the fact that...

520
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,100
What in God's name am I responsible for?!

521
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:37,980
Huh?

522
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,230
I am too sensitive to practice law.

523
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,460
But I can't do any good with all my effin' sensitivities,

524
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,910
'cause I'm not sensitive enough to know

525
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,520
that it's gonna freakin' rain!

526
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,990
- Allison...
- Shut up and drive.

527
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,470
Look, I know you're trying
to make me feel better.

528
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,600
But I gotta tell you,
yesterday when I thought,

529
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,160
"I know where this body is,

530
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,790
I can help them hold this guy,

531
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,650
I can help them get this guy,"

532
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,790
I felt so like I was where I belong.

533
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,080
I don't mean in Texas. But,

534
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,050
in the field, on the line, like...

535
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,660
this is what I'm supposed to be doing.

536
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,780
This is why I'm here. Finally!

537
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,120
This is why I am the way I am.

538
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,970
And when I woke up and found that
none of it mattered...

539
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,000
that it had all just been washed away...

540
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,960
that God had played some cruel joke on me...

541
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:49,730
What?!

542
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,410
You're thinking I'm the most conceited,
self-involved person you've ever met.

543
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,400
- Whoa, what? Hey, did I say...?
- You're thinking,

544
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,110
"What kind of person

545
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,140
"thinks God Himself would unleash a rain storm
just to screw with their head?"

546
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,370
- Oh, that's just nuts.
- Oh, no. I'm nuts.

547
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,670
That's what you think, isn't it?

548
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,420
God, I never said that.

549
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,910
I didn't say you said it.

550
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,740
It's not what I was thinking, either.

551
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,960
What I was thinking was, "Go read his mind...

552
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,770
your 17-year-old pedophile..."

553
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,270
"and leave me alone!"

554
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,750
- That may have been in there.
- Mm-hmm.

555
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,070
Actually, that's a brilliant idea.

556
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,720
What is?

557
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,520
Captain Push of the Texas Rangers, please.

558
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,300
Excuse me, Captain, my client is due
to be released in just nine hours.

559
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,600
If you've uncovered any new evidence that potentially
jeopardizes that, I have a right to know about it.

560
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,550
Why don't you just relax, Counselor?

561
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,590
Don't make me call The New York Times!

562
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,730
Hi.

563
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,480
Thank you for speaking with me.
My name is Allison DuBois.

564
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,840
Okay.

565
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,090
You're with the prison?

566
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,360
Not really.

567
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:08,640
Oh.

568
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,010
You're a reporter?
'Cause I can't talk to reporters.

569
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,860
No.

570
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,940
I'm actually kind of a friend of your sister's.

571
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,100
Ma'am, my-my sister's dead.

572
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,310
I know that.

573
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,480
She seems happy, by the way.

574
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,600
I mean...

575
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,120
she's worried about you,
'cause of what you did and all.

576
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,600
But aside from that...

577
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,000
She's still at the house, you know.

578
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,720
She saw what you did.

579
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,260
Told me where the body was.

580
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,420
I came here hoping

581
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,730
I would feel something from you...

582
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,650
hear something from inside your head...

583
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,570
but...

584
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,910
What?

585
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,510
You're so pretty.

586
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,670
You look like an ad for milk or toothpaste.

587
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,380
But when I listen to your soul,

588
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,150
all I hear are the sounds
of small animals being tortured

589
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,190
and children crying.

590
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,960
You know,
you didn't walk into this room alone.

591
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:26,770
I don't mean them.

592
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,490
It's nothing you can see.

593
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,850
But over there, standing in the corner...

594
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,610
is the ghost of the man who molested you
after the Easter barbecue

595
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,960
your aunt and uncle took you to
when you were eight.

596
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,510
And standing next to him

597
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,710
is the man who molested him

598
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,690
at summer camp in Michigan in 1967.

599
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,070
And that man's soul

600
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,460
is forever haunted by the souls
of the three men

601
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:53,350
who took advantage of that man
when he was a ten-year-old boy back in 1955

602
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,170
on a school trip to Washington D.C.

603
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,470
- I... I would like to go now!
- Wait!

604
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,740
I'm just getting started.
The room is filled with them.

605
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,310
It's you men I'm talking to.

606
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,240
You men know what I'm looking for.

607
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,330
If any of you have anything to say... anything...

608
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,380
to help break this chain of evil...

609
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,640
I can hear you.

610
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
You just have to speak to me.

611
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,500
Just speak to me.

612
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,130
He told everything to the boy in the next cell?

613
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,730
Yep.

614
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,850
Who told you this?
Never mind.

615
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,500
I don't want to know.

616
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,570
All right, quiet on this block.

617
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,130
Quiet down, back up.

618
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,950
Quiet on this block.

619
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,650
Raymond Vargas,
stand and approach the cell door, please.

620
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,250
Son,

621
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,850
I have it on pretty good authority
that the boy in the next cell and you

622
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,030
talk some late at night.

623
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,650
Who are you?

624
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,990
And who's she?

625
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,980
Your friend next door...

626
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,710
he ever mention a six-year-old boy?

627
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,660
Where he might have taken him?

628
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,880
What he might have done with him?

629
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,080
What, you mean the kid
who sleeps over here?

630
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,250
He's a prevert.

631
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,200
I don't talk to preverts.

632
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,450
And preverts don't talk to me.

633
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,210
He don't talk to "preverts."

634
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,700
Tell him...

635
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,570
you know about the kiss.

636
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,440
Kiss?

637
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,800
- What kiss?
- Just tell him.

638
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:22,810
But whisper.

639
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,180
Uh...

640
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,270
So...

641
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,420
you two don't speak?

642
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,450
Man, I already told you, no.

643
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,870
What's the deal with the hat?

644
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,980
Today Cowboy Day?

645
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:00,940
I know about the kiss.

646
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,390
Wait a second.

647
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,600
He told you that?

648
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,370
The prevert told you about that?

649
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,360
Right now, son,

650
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,440
I'm much more interested

651
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,170
in what he told you.

652
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,030
Thank you, sir.

653
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,180
You will see me in court.

654
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,120
Bye-bye.

655
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,860
That was the State Attorney's office.

656
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:43,920
They just delivered
Raymond Vargas' sworn statement to the Judge,

657
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,500
and he's agreed to allow us
to hold and formally charge the 17-year-old.

658
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,700
Whoo!

659
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,070
With three hours to spare.

660
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,350
So, I'm curious.

661
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,250
The kiss...

662
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,320
you didn't mention that
before we went into Raymond's cell.

663
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,960
Who told you about that?

664
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,520
Was there some... ghost...

665
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,280
some spirit there on the cell block
with us that was talking to you?

666
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,740
Well... no.

667
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,150
Well, how'd you find out about that kiss?

668
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,360
I made it up.

669
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,930
Excuse me, lady?

670
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,100
Oh, put your bug eyes back in your head.

671
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,160
I said I made it up.
I took a shot.

672
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,700
I figured he'd either be so offended he'd talk,
or he'd be so embarrassed he'd talk. So, either way...

673
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,850
This... is not good for my heart.

674
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,770
Thank you.

675
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,120
Really.

676
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,160
Thank you.

677
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,760
No. Thank you.

678
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,080
So, anyway,
I've come to the conclusion that I am...

679
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,320
constitutionally incapable of being an attorney.

680
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,680
Okay.

681
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,110
But I'm confused.
What led to this change of heart?

682
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:16,670
I can't really talk about it.

683
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,570
Suffice it to say,
I'm apparently either a little psychic or a little psycho.

684
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:24,430
Oh.

685
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:28,560
So, anyway, I wanted to come in
and officially resign my internship.

686
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,760
I see.

687
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,970
And thank you again for the opportunity.

688
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,850
Allison.

689
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,990
While you were gone, Martinez confessed.

690
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,130
Seems he did shoot Pablo once in the leg.

691
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,580
Then he said he heard a baby crying...

692
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,290
shot the mother
who had accidentally suffocated the baby.

693
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:47,510
Then he came back and shot Pablo

694
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,470
six more times.

695
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,180
So what does this mean?
What are you going to do now?

696
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,590
So, he just hired you?

697
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,020
Well it's not full time.
I'm more like a consultant.

698
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,150
A secret consultant, and we can't really tell anybody that I work there.

699
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,590
Cool!

700
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,080
Yeah!

701
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,140
He wants me to help him pick

702
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:14,510
juries, interview potential witnesses and suspects,
go on lineups, things like that.

703
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,480
They're only going to call me when they need me.
We're sort of going to play it by ear.

704
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:18,560
That's awesome.

705
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,090
- Thanks.
- Holy cow!

706
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,110
Holy cow!

707
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,930
Yeah. I really want you to go in
and just get him to tell you his story.

708
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,720
They wanted you to have this.
It's his statement.

709
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:40,650
- They thought you might want to take a look at it.
- Thanks.

710
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:53,190
So, according to the statement you gave the police,
you came home from...

711
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:58,610
work, and she was just...

712
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,590
your wife, I mean...
she was just there like that.

713
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:05,970
Yeah.

714
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,520
I got off at 5 : 20.

715
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,440
Drove home.

716
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,650
Stopped for gas.

717
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:17,490
It was winter, you know, so...

718
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,440
by the time I pulled in the driveway,
it was dark.
