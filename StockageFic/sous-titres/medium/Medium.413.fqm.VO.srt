00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:07,150
**********

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,090
whose eyes are constantly on
the hunt for shades not pulled,

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,570
the shutters not fully closed.

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,520
A coward cloaked in anonymity,

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,450
he tells himself that
watching is a victimless crime.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,670
After all, she'd be undressing anyway.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,570
Until he sees something
he wasn't counting on.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,390
Does he speak up, give up his anonymity,

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,960
or keep silent, pretend he didn't see?

10
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,380
You okay?

11
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,720
Yeah... just a dream.

12
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,260
It was nothing. It was stupid.

13
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,150
Well,that's not fair,sneaking
out while I'm sleeping.

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,820
Where you going?

15
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,650
Home. I need to spend
a night in my own bed.

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,240
I need to spend a morning
in my own bathroom.

17
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,730
Don't go anywhere. I sleep
better when you're here.

18
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,600
Man up. Learn to sleep
alone. All the big kids do it.

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,400
It's Kim Furlong.

20
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,130
Hmm,she wants me to call her.

21
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,920
Kim? Monday Tennis Kim?

22
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,240
It's 11:40. You sure you don't
want to wait till tomorrow?

23
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,230
I don't know. She and her husband
haven't been getting along.

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,760
She must need to talk.

25
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,530
You all right? Another dream?

26
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,890
Yeah.

27
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,880
This one stupid,too?

28
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,000
I wish.

29
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,910
You want to tell me about it?

30
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:27,360
I don't know. There were... there were
people we knew in it: Scanlon and Lynn DiNovi.

31
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,830
Okay. What happened
to them? Something bad?

32
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,530
No,they were in bed.

33
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,880
Excellent. Tell me more.

34
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,100
Ugh,I felt like a peeping
Tom. I guess I should call.

35
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,490
What time is it?

36
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,910
Almost exactly 11:40.

37
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,820
It's Kim Furlong. Hmm,she
wants me to call her.

38
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,690
Kim? Monday Tennis Kim?

39
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,990
It's 11:40. You sure you don't
want to wait till tomorrow?

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,960
I don't know. She and her husband
haven't been getting along.

41
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,680
She must need to talk.

42
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,910
Scanlon.

43
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,560
Lee,don't ask me how, but I know
Lynn is there with you right now

44
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,060
and I know she's trying
to reach a friend of hers.

45
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,130
Get the address from Lynn and
send an ambulance there now.

46
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,630
I'm not getting any answer.

47
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,520
Uh,well,that's okay.

48
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,780
You can hang up now 'cause I
got Allison Dubois on the phone

49
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,410
and,apparently,she's
got all the answers.

50
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,130
I'm gonna hand you to Lynn.

51
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,110
Uh,and Allison,do me a
favor and close your eyes.

52
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,630
I got to get out of bed now
and I'm not wearing any clothes.

56
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,140
xplain that we knew
to send an ambulance?

57
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,110
I guess we'll just cross that
bridge when we come to it.

58
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,370
I don't know what to tell you. I mean...

59
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,360
we had a fight, a stupid fight
over a business trip I had to take,

60
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,290
and I went to sleep in the guest room.

61
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,000
Next thing I know,there's
an ambulance at the door.

62
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:03,670
I-I guess she must have been in some
kind of distress and called them.

63
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,440
It's a dream,right? It's
just a horrible dream.

64
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,960
Tomorrow I'll wake up and she'll be
fine and then we'll make up and it...

65
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,840
it'll just never have happened.

66
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,760
Thank you.

67
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,070
For,uh, calling.

68
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,650
Thank you,Allison.

69
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,920
I don't know... I don't
know what good it did.

70
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,090
I don't know what difference it made.

71
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,740
I am so sorry,Lynn.

72
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,430
JOE: Everybody have plates?

73
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,510
I don't want to get over there with this
hot pan and find out there are no plates.

74
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,850
Everybody has plates.

75
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,810
What about silverware?

76
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,720
Ariel's supposed to do the silverware.

77
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,450
Yeah,but Ariel's not here
yet and the eggs are done.

78
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,940
Ariel!

79
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,810
Bridge,don't do that.

80
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,050
Mommy's still asleep.
She was out all night.

81
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,460
I'll get the silverware.

82
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,640
- Dad...
- Yeah?

83
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,030
Marie's creasing up her face again.

84
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,300
What are you talking about?

85
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,580
Take a look.

86
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,620
Honey, why are you doing that?

87
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,150
Doing what?

88
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,600
What are you smiling about,hmm?

89
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,910
No,don't tell me. Let me guess.

90
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,000
You got a full night's sleep.

91
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,430
You're not doing too badly
yourself. It's a quarter to 1:00.

92
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,950
You're kidding.

93
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,590
Did everybody get to school okay?

94
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,410
Uh-huh,everyone and
everything is just lovely.

95
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,690
And you know what else?

96
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,660
I got my first salary check.

97
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,800
Came in the mail today from
Dubois-Doyle Enterprises, Inc. LLC.

98
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,360
Dubois-Doyle Enterprises,Inc. LLC.

99
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,250
- I like it.
- Yeah, and not a moment too soon,

100
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,620
'cause I think the little one
is in need of a pair of glasses.

101
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,640
In need of what?

102
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,250
JOE: So I called around.

103
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,660
Everyone wants to know what
kind of insurance we have,

104
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,390
and then when I'd explain to them that we
actually don't have any insurance at the moment

105
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,560
I could literally hear the doctors'
schedules magically fill up.

106
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,340
"And I'm really sorry, but we don't
have anything for at least two months."

107
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,980
You all right?

108
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,380
Yeah,I just have a headache.
So what are we going to do?

109
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,600
Well,I finally found someone.

110
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,450
Actually specializes
in children's optometry.

111
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,680
It's just I had to give
him a credit card number,

112
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,930
like making a reservation
for a hotel or something.

113
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,550
I'm gonna take her over there tomorrow.

114
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,320
Oh,I'll get it. I'll get it.

115
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,830
Hey,don't open that door.
Check who it is first.

116
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,070
It's probably for me.

117
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,020
Meghan said that she might messenger over
some paperwork about competing projects.

118
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,020
I can't wait to meet
this Meghan,actually.

119
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:05,760
Thanks,Bridge.

120
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,540
- It's for Mommy.
- Oh,thanks.

121
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,540
What is it,Mommy?

122
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,590
It's,uh,just a favor that
Mommy did for a friend,

123
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,760
got involved in something that's
really none of my business.

124
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,260
I'm gonna take a look at this later.

125
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,490
Right now, Mommy's
fighting off a headache.

126
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,460
So your new business partner...

127
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,570
how old would you say she is?

128
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,260
I don't know.

129
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,460
Couple years older than you,maybe?

130
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,910
What an excellent answer.

131
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,330
You can continue to be my husband.

132
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,770
Mm,you're too kind.

133
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,870
Is she married?

134
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,820
I honestly don't know.

135
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,880
Does she have a ring?

136
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,130
I didn't really notice.

137
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,000
Well,how could you not notice?

138
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,810
I don't know.

139
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,780
I'm a boy; it's one of the differences.

140
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,660
We don't notice rings.

141
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,890
We pee standing up.

142
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,260
You have to take this
up with someone else.

143
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,750
Hello?

144
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,370
Sorry to call so late.
Hope I didn't wake anyone.

145
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,410
You get that care package I sent over?

146
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,850
The photographs?Yeah,they
got here earlier,

147
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,570
but frankly,Lee, I'm not
sure why I'm looking at them.

148
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,890
It's not like I dream about
my friends on a regular basis.

149
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,640
In fact,I almost never do.

150
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,080
And it's like you said--
there's no crime here.

151
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,070
That girl just fell down
and split her head open.

152
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,520
Yeah, that's what I'm calling about.

153
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,840
Coroner suspects foul play.

154
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,110
What are you talking about?
What kind of foul play?

155
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,460
Lynn's friend was poisoned-- some
kind of extreme muscle relaxant.

156
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,700
Poisoned?

157
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,870
Are you sure it wasn't
an accidental overdose?

158
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,110
No,it's not looking that way.

159
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,240
All they found in her
stomach was a martini,

160
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,640
some breakfast cereal,and a
couple of Adviprin capsules.

161
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,690
I'm bringing her hubby in
for questioning tomorrow.

162
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,380
I was wondering if you might
be interested in listening in.

163
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,920
I don't think I can get you paid,but...

164
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,800
Lynn and I would consider
it a personal favor.

165
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,010
Are you okay?

166
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,760
Allison?

167
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,500
I... you know what? I'm not feeling great
and I,I just have this wicked headache.

168
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,990
Hey,wait a second.

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What did you say that they found in her?

170
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,230
Uh,in her blood or in her stomach?

171
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,430
In her stomach they found some
cereal,some booze, and some Adviprin.

172
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,620
Allison?

173
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,900
Hello? Allison?

174
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,850
Excuse me. Sir? I
need you over here,sir.

175
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,730
Thank you. That's right. Come over here.

176
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,150
She'll be fine back there.
They'll take good care of her.

177
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,290
All right,I'm putting through
these two credit cards,

178
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,800
but if they don't clear, I-I don't
know what to tell you, Mr. Dubois.

179
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,220
You sure you don't have insurance?

180
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,160
I'm positive.

181
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,610
Mr. Dubois? Mr. Joseph Dubois?

182
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,010
Yeah? That's me.

183
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,330
How's my wife? Did she
regain consciousness?

184
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:25,290
No. Uh,yes. I mean,she's still out.

185
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,680
But she seems... fine.

186
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,530
I mean,in every measurable
way,absolutely fine.

187
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,620
Actually,if I didn't know any better,
I'd be tempted to tell you she's simply...

188
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,900
asleep.

189
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,260
Even though we can't wake her.

190
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,460
But she's not in a coma,not...

191
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,010
if you look at her brain waves. If
you look at her brain waves, she's...

192
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,230
asleep.

193
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,270
Joe.

194
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,580
I'm sorry.

195
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,090
I'm sorry. I really am.

196
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,810
What are you talking about?

197
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,610
You don't have anything
to be sorry about.

198
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,790
Look,I know you didn't choose to...

199
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,120
pass out,fall asleep-- whatever
it was that happened back there.

200
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,340
Joe...

201
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,830
So what did you dream?

202
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,070
That must have been
a hell of a dream,huh?

203
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,450
You see where Jimmy Hoffa was buried?

204
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,480
Did Lee Harvey Oswald whisper
something to you about a second gunman?

205
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,470
Talk to me.

206
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,910
Is it going to be Obama or Hillary?
Inquiring minds want to know.

207
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,930
You're so angry. Why
do you sound so angry?

208
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,990
"Why?" Uh,well...

209
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,460
Well,let's start with that
was a $500 nap you just took.

210
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,270
And,oh,wait, here's another.

211
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,890
Uh,you scared the crap out of me. "Why?"

212
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,980
Oh,my God.

213
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,870
What are you doing? What's going on?

214
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,800
I didn't dream anything.

215
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,040
Okay.

216
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,090
At the hospital. You
asked me what I dreamt.

217
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,340
I said I didn't dream anything.

218
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,150
Nothing at all.

219
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,910
I think that was the point.

220
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,490
Lee,I know it's the
middle of the night...

221
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,520
Look,if this is about me leaving the
seat up just now, it's not a big deal.

222
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,570
I'm here by myself tonight.

223
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,390
But if it'll get you off the
phone, I'll go back in and lower it.

224
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,450
Stop kidding around.

225
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,420
I need to know what's going
on with Kim Furlong's husband.

226
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,780
Well,it's like I said earlier.

227
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,900
I'm bringing him in tomorrow.

228
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,350
I'd love to have you there.

229
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,480
Also getting a search warrant
so I can go through the house.

230
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,160
See if we can find that poison.

231
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,470
I don't know why I didn't think of it.

232
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,740
I should've called you hours
ago. It just didn't occur to me.

233
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,660
You need to look under the bed.

234
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,290
Check under the bed for
a bottle of Adviprin.

235
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,550
I have a hunch that you're going
to find your poison in there.

236
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,160
So wait a second.

237
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,290
You're saying there's a bottle of Adviprin
under the bed and the poison's in the bottle?

238
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,710
In the capsules.

239
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,140
MARIE: Cow. Horse, pig,duck.

240
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,000
That's perfect. That's
absolutely perfect.

241
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,920
This child has perfect vision.

242
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,830
Cow,horse,pig,duck-- that's
perfect. That's 20/20.

243
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,940
Well,I-I don't understand it.

244
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,290
There's nothing to understand.

245
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,010
She sees every animal, no
matter how big or small it is.

246
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,830
You know these charts by
heart,don't you,doctor?

247
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,330
That's what I listen to all day.

248
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,820
Kids reading these
charts. Why do you ask?

249
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,910
Well,I was,uh,wondering, were
you thinking about it just now?

250
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,940
I mean,when my daughter was looking at the
chart, were you running through it in your head?

251
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,340
Your daughter has perfect vision.

252
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,770
What is or isn't in
my head is immaterial.

253
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,740
Now,if you or your wife have your
heart set on her wearing glasses...

254
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,350
- Nobody has their heart set on it.
- I can sell you some frames with optically clear lenses.

255
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,840
I just know that my
daughter needs glasses.

256
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,390
And that is the end of this examination.

257
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,150
Thank you,Mr. Dubois.

258
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,300
Nice to meet you,Marie.

259
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,890
Honey? Do me a favor.
Read the chart again.

260
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,590
- That chart?
- Yeah.

261
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,580
Is that an animal?

262
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,790
- Hi,Lynn.
- Russell.

263
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,570
Detective.

264
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,390
Ma'am,I-I came over as
soon as I got the message.

265
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,610
Mr. Furlong,I know this
is a difficult time.

266
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,040
I know you have a lot of
things to do and figure out,

267
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,320
but I was wondering if I could
ask you just a couple of questions?

268
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,480
Get your opinion on a couple of things?

269
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,140
Yeah,I-I've got my
in-laws flying in.

270
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:07,130
They're going to be landing in
about an hour,20, but... yeah,sure.

271
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,390
Are you aware of
anybody that might've...

272
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,500
might've wanted to see your wife dead?

273
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,500
Excuse me?

274
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,590
Your wife. Did she have any enemies?

275
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,320
I'm confused. Why are
you asking me that?

276
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,200
My wife died in an accident.

277
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,770
Russell...

278
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,680
Kim was murdered.

279
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,950
No,she wasn't.

280
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,920
No,she wasn't. She,she tripped and fell.

281
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,790
She cracked her head and bled to death.

282
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,000
Yes,Mr. Furlong.

283
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,260
She was poisoned,actually.

284
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,240
And when the poison made it impossible
for her to get blood to her brain,

285
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,670
she fell and cracked her skull open.

286
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,930
But it was the poison in
her blood that killed her,

287
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,590
not the fall or the
bleeding or the fracture.

288
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,160
But who-who would do
something like that and why?

289
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,210
That's what we're here to find out.

290
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,200
We have a hunch that the answer lies in
the pain reliever your wife was taking.

291
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,300
I believe that the bottle
might've rolled under the bed.

292
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,860
Do you think it's still there?

293
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,130
Nobody's touched that room.
The police told us not to.

294
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,250
I-I mean me and the housekeeper.

295
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,140
So the bottle should still be there?

296
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,450
I'm sure it is.

297
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,410
I've already asked a
judge for a search warrant.

298
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,220
As soon as it comes through do you mind
if I sent an officer by to pick it up?

299
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,610
You don't have to wait
for a search warrant.

300
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,890
I mean,if something criminal has gone on
here, I mean,I'll call the house right now.

301
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,850
My housekeeper's there. Just have an
officer go by and collect whatever you need.

302
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,530
I told you.

303
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,490
It would also be helpful,
just to rule yours out,

304
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:50,910
if we could get a set of
fingerprints,a DNA swab of your cheek.

305
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,340
Yes,well,whatever you need.

306
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,010
Oh,just one more thing,Mr. Furlong.

307
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,970
On the night that your wife died, you
mentioned that the two of you were fighting.

308
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,180
What are you trying to say?

309
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,910
What is he trying to say?

310
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm trying to say that I appreciate
how cooperative you're being.

311
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,780
And I'm trying to say I understand that you're
a friend of a friend, but if I were you...

312
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:21,840
I'd make a little time today to find
yourself a good criminal attorney.

313
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,060
Just in case.

314
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,360
I'm telling you, she was
reading the guy's mind.

315
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,270
I mean,he knew exactly what
the animals was supposed to be,

316
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,330
so she knew exactly what the
animals was supposed to be.

317
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,480
As soon as he left the room,
she couldn't see a thing.

318
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,130
Maybe we should try another optometrist.

319
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,650
I don't want to try another optometrist.

320
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,190
I can't afford another optometrist.

321
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,580
Besides,I've already
paid for this optometrist.

322
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,450
He misdiagnosed our daughter,
and I want him to get it right.

323
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,370
Can you remind these
people that we have kids?

324
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,200
Hello?

325
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,650
So what are you doing?

326
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,580
I'm sitting in bed with
my husband complaining

327
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,360
'cause people call at all
hours even though we have kids.

328
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,120
What are you doing?

329
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,960
Sitting in a bar with my
girlfriend drinking too much.

330
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,640
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

331
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:13,500
You've met Furlong twice now. Any
impressions? Any feelings about him?

332
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,560
Well,I sit in the room with him.
I see the same things you see.

333
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,930
I hear the same things you hear. Why?

334
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,260
You were right about the Adviprin.

335
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,360
That's where we found the poison.

336
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,450
We also found Furlong's
fingerprints all over the bottle.

337
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,980
Well,it was his bottle.
It was in his house.

338
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,730
And on every single capsule
in it along with a tiny hole

339
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,180
where someone injected the poison
through the gelatin capsule casing.

340
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,280
Officers just went over to the
house now to place him under arrest.

341
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,440
Do you have anything to add?

342
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,050
No,just that I'm sorry.

343
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,140
I'm sorry I,I didn't do more to help.

344
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:50,520
I'm sorry I didn't see it sooner.

345
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,140
How's Lynn doing?

346
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,820
She's doing.

347
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,540
Go back to your husband. Get some
sleep. I'll call you in the morning.

348
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,760
Is everything all right?

349
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:13,100
A woman was poisoned. Turns out it
was her husband. I met the guy twice.

350
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,210
I didn't even get an inkling.

351
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,200
I guess he loved her once.

352
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,980
Just makes me sad.

353
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,650
Claims. No,this isn't India.

354
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,890
This is America. How may I help you,sir?

355
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,340
I'm sorry?

356
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:41,110
Are you asking me who the
President of the United States is?

357
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,550
What is this,some kind of test?

358
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:49,650
I told you I'm in America,
the United States of America.

359
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,410
Well,I don't like your attitude.

360
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,770
Ms. Hastings?

361
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,360
Is there some special reason
you're not on the telephone?

362
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,730
The incoming call
board is completely red.

363
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,240
I'm sorry.

364
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,320
The last caller was a jerk and...

365
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,170
honestly,I have these cramps.

366
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,120
I feel like crap.

367
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,870
Trust me, Ms. Hastings,
we all feel like crap.

368
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,290
There's not a single person working
here who when they were six years old

369
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,120
dreamed of answering phones in the
claims department of an insurance agency.

370
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,990
That's why we pay you.

371
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
To take some of the sting out of it.

372
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,880
If I could just go to
the restroom for a minute.

373
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,900
If you leave your desk,
don't bother coming back.

374
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:52,810
So then she said that if I
left, not to bother coming back.

375
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,500
No,really, that is what she said.

376
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm at the car.

377
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:03,020
No. I'm at the car.

378
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,680
Of course I'm fine. All
I took were two Adviprin.

379
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,150
See you at home.

380
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,530
- Dad?
- Yeah?

381
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,180
Do we look alike?

382
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,230
That's not funny. That's
not even a little funny.

383
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,320
I mean, if you can't see the
TV, I'm happy to turn the TV off.

384
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:28,080
I can see the TV. I can see the
TV fine. I can see the TV great.

385
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,500
Yeah. I had a hunch.

386
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,190
I still need you to help me
figure out this optometrist thing.

387
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,130
Hello? You gonna get off there soon?

388
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,690
I got some stuff I need to print out for this
meeting with,uh, Meghan and the model maker.

389
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,850
Ariel?

390
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,730
Hey,give me another word
for a parking garage.

391
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,830
Uh,parking structure, public parking.

392
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,680
Car park,I think they
call it in England.

393
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,900
Guess it hasn't happened yet.

394
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,540
What are you doing?

395
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,000
Did you just shut off the computer?

396
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,960
Why did you shut off the computer?

397
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,240
I told you I had a
meeting to-to prepare for.

398
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,040
Ariel?

399
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,500
You know I'm getting the kids breakfast.

400
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,940
I'm probably taking them
to school, and,you know,

401
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,010
somehow I'm supposed to
be ready for this meeting.

402
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,510
Sorry. I'm sorry. It was an accident.

403
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,440
I wasn't listening. I wasn't
paying attention. Here.

404
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,480
Prepare for your meeting.
I'll take the girls to school.

405
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,610
I was going to run in to
downtown to see Scanlon anyway.

406
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,910
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

407
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,850
A car drive off the
roof of a parking garage?

408
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,320
No. I'm pretty sure I
would have heard about that.

409
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,120
That's the kind of thing
someone would have noticed.

410
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,610
That's the kind of thing
they'd bring up at roll call.

411
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,160
Okay. So maybe it hasn't happened yet.

412
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,830
Or maybe it didn't happen in Phoenix.

413
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,190
Which is great,'cause maybe we
could stop it from happening.

414
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,820
Maybe we can put out a warning.

415
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,590
What kind of warning?

416
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,350
This woman took Adviprin
right before it happened.

417
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,780
Well,at least she won't have a
headache when she hits the sidewalk.

418
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,240
I'm serious! I'm starting to think this has
nothing to do with Kim Furlong's husband.

419
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,620
I think there's something wrong
with Adviprin-- all of it--

420
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,180
and we're going to be
seeing a lot more of this.

421
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,740
Well,if and when we do, we'll
react accordingly, but right now,

422
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,360
what I'm being told by people a
hell of a lot smarter than I am

423
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:01,420
is that this Adviprin was adulterated not in the
manufacturing process, but sometime afterwards.

424
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,940
Maybe Mr. Furlong wasn't
just mad at his wife.

425
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,320
Maybe he had a beef with,uh...

426
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,830
Hastings. Her last name's Hastings.
I think we need to find her.

427
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,170
This Hastings woman.

428
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,990
Maybe he didn't like the way she handled his
claim, but there's nothing for me to do now.

429
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,580
You mean,you aren't
going to help me find her?

430
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,190
You just told me you couldn't be
certain where this dream took place.

431
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,460
Allison,have you got any idea how many
insurance companies there are in Phoenix?

432
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:26,140
In Arizona? In the Southwest? Not to
mention, how many people named Hastings?

433
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:35,220
All right. We'll set you up in one of the interview
rooms with a computer, some phone books and a phone.

434
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:38,650
If anyone asks what you're doing, we'll tell 'em
you're selling tickets to the Policeman's Ball.

435
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,710
- Do they still have a Policeman's Ball?
- Got me.

436
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,610
No,I need another
appointment with the doctor.

437
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,360
No,I know he's already seen my daughter,
but I need to have him see her again.

438
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,570
I know people's eyes
don't change overnight.

439
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,880
I'm sorry. I got to call you back.

440
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,670
What are you doing?

441
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,270
I thought you understood.

442
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,580
The drawings on the green;
the charts on the yellow.

443
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:10,270
Calm down,man. We'll fix it. It's paper.

444
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,960
Where you going?

445
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,040
To get the yellow.

446
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,750
You don't have the yellow?

447
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,630
Not up here. I'm not a mind reader,man.

448
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,020
It's got nothing to do with being a
mind reader. I told you about the yellow.

449
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,580
No,you didn't, but that's
okay. I'll get some.

450
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,380
Yeah,I did. And it has nothing
to do with being a mind reader.

451
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,510
It has to do with listening, and you can't listen
to people when you're piping music into your brain.

452
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,090
You can't listen. You can't concentrate.

453
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,510
It's amazing you can
see, much less be a...

454
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,120
Sir? You okay?

455
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:41,410
Uh,yeah. No. Uh,you just
gave me an idea, actually.

456
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,040
Okay. You still want
me to get the yellow?

457
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,910
Yeah,definitely. Um,and
I'm sorry I raised my voice.

458
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,890
That's okay. I wasn't paying attention.

459
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,330
This is Joe Dubois again.

460
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,190
Uh,listen,now more than ever, I really need
that second appointment for my daughter.

461
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,090
I know this is the
Fremont Insurance Group.

462
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:04,520
I'm looking for a customer service rep,
a woman with the last name Hastings.

463
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,290
You don't have anyone by that name?

464
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,410
My apologies. Thank you.

465
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,930
Hello?

466
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,830
So what are you doing?

467
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,580
You don't want to know.
What are you doing?

468
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,530
Uh,you don't want to know, either,
but I'm going to tell you anyway.

469
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:32,130
I'm stuck in traffic,um, so
I'm calling my wife to say

470
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:36,270
that I think you probably have to stop whatever it
is you're doing and go pick up the kids from school.

471
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,700
Oh,Joe,I don't think I can.

472
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:43,370
I'm looking for a needle in an
alphabetical haystack, and I'm only up to F.

473
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,880
I don't know what to tell
you,honey. It's non-negotiable.

474
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:50,400
I'm at a dead stop. I haven't
moved a foot in 15 minutes. Sorry.

475
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,920
Oh,and I got another appointment for
Marie with the optometrist for tomorrow.

476
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,410
Well,that's great.

477
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,550
You moving yet? Tell me you're moving.

478
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,740
I'm not moving,Allison, and
I'm not going to be moving.

479
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:05,090
According to the radio, I'm going
to be stuck in this mess for hours.

480
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,270
I don't really understand
it, but they're saying

481
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,360
that somehow a car fell off the top level
of a parking structure onto the sidewalk.

482
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:15,350
Like,five or six stories, and they're saying
that they think that somebody might be inside it.

483
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,060
Tainted Adviprin is now being suspected
in the death of Marjorie Hastings,

484
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:23,810
the woman behind the wheel of this car, which
plunged seven stories to the sidewalk below.

485
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,840
You threw ours away,right?

486
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,360
Additionally,reports are coming
in from around the state of

487
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:32,430
as many as three more deaths that are being
preliminarily linked to tampered Adviprin.

488
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,990
Meanwhile,as the tainted
medicine scare grows,

489
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,620
its implications were felt this
afternoon at the Phoenix Courthouse

490
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:43,510
where Acting District Attorney Van Dyke
held a press conference shortly after 3:00.

491
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,530
As I'm sure all of you are aware,

492
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,050
we've received a number of
reports from around the state

493
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:53,580
about fatalities arising from
adulterated Adviprin gelatin capsules.

494
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,880
In light of these recent developments,

495
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,520
my office has arranged for the
immediate release of Mr. Russell Furlong,

496
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:05,290
who until this afternoon was held under suspicion
of murder in relation to the deathof his wife.

497
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,700
Our investigation...

498
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,490
You met the guy,right?

499
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,750
What do you think is going
through his head right now?

500
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,050
and the manufacturers...

501
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,080
I mean,he loses his wife, and then
he spends a day and a half in jail.

502
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,970
I can't even imagine it.

503
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,230
They had a fight.

504
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,260
I'm sorry?

505
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,190
They had a fight the
night that she died.

506
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,430
About some business
trip that he had to take.

507
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,250
When we went to go see him, that
was the first thing that he told us.

508
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,620
It didn't really stick
with me at the time, but...

509
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,210
right now...

510
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,650
you know,tonight...

511
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,510
All alone in that house.

512
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:53,840
I bet he really regrets that fight.

513
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,970
It's your turn.

514
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,110
My turn? My God. What drink is this?
How many drinks have we all had?

515
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,790
It won't work. It's your turn.

516
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,430
Come on. I told you about
my sister. It's your turn.

517
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,380
Hey,Brown Eyes, we're here
for at least four more hours.

518
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,290
- It's not like you're going to get out of it.
- I know,I know.

519
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,590
Nobody even knows your name,fellow.

520
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,600
Nobody knows anybody's
name, so what's the problem?

521
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,070
There's no problem. It's just...

522
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,970
Okay. Okay,here it is.

523
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,880
Every night, before I fall asleep,

524
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:33,090
I think about my wife...dying.

525
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,790
What do you mean?

526
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,910
I mean,being dead.

527
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,260
And for a long time,I'd think
about her getting a disease--

528
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:44,020
you know,cancer or
something, but,uh,lately...

529
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:50,090
it's me. I do it. I kill her.

530
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,870
do this so early, but I got to get back to
my place, pick up Lynn and get to the funeral.

531
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,500
Say hi to the happy widower for me.

532
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,620
I spent most of last night with him.

533
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,610
What are you talking about?

534
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,470
I had a dream he was talking about Kim.

535
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,960
Talking about how he wanted her dead.

536
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,270
Talking to who?

537
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,970
I don't know.

538
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,820
When did this happen?

539
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,940
I don't know.

540
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,220
Where did this happen?

541
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,000
You know,when it comes to our significant
others, there are a lot of people,

542
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:28,630
particularly a lot of married people,
who say things they don't mean.

543
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:32,270
I'll be sure to mention that
to your significant other.

544
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,790
Allison,we've got five fatalities
attributed to this Adviprin.

545
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,810
Are you trying to tell me that you
think Furlong knocked them all off?

546
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,170
I don't know. Maybe.

547
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,790
Well,now,that makes no sense.
How the hell would he do that?

548
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,670
You said that something was injected
into the capsules. A muscle relaxant.

549
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,830
He could have done it to more than
one bottle, more than one person.

550
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,390
You kill five people to disguise the fact
that you really only care about killing one.

551
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,030
Sorry. I'm not buying it.

552
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:06,240
Hello again, Mr. Dubois.

553
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,730
Please tell me that's
little Marie's twin.

554
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,730
Ah,no such luck.

555
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:16,780
Mr. Dubois,I assure you, your child was given a
completely thorough examination the last time she was here.

556
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,610
Um,have you ever heard
of my wife,Allison Dubois?

557
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,030
There was a lot of stuff in the
newspaper about her last year. No?

558
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,410
Well,uh... She worked for the district
attorney's office, um,and she's very,uh...

559
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,750
Well,she's very
sensitive, very intuitive.

560
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,150
I don't know if you believe
in any of that stuff.

561
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:38,320
You know-- talking to the dead,
dreaming of the future, reading minds?

562
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,330
I have no idea where
you're going with this.

563
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,770
Do you like music,Doctor?
What kind of music do you like?

564
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,340
Actually,this is my oldest,so,uh...

565
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,880
Uh,do you like show
tunes, The Sound of Music?

566
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:52,910
Here,humor me. Just listen
to this for just a minute.

567
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,400
Okay,sweetie... No,uh,no,no,no.

568
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,730
No,I don't want you looking
at what line I'm pointing at.

569
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,940
I don't want you thinking about
what line I'm pointing at over there.

570
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,840
I just want you to listen to
Julie Andrews and watch Marie.

571
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,200
All right,sweetie. Can you
tell me what this line says?

572
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,390
Give me a hint,Daddy.

573
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:32,110
Oh,my...

574
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,110
Look at you, grinning from ear to ear.

575
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:42,060
I've never seen someone so pleased to
discover that their child has astigmatism.

576
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,470
You're just jealous.

577
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,240
- Oh,really?
- That's right.

578
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,010
'Cause I had a problem and I
figured out how to solve it.

579
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,150
Now tell your Mack Daddy your problem.

580
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,220
Let's see if we can turn
that frown upside-down,huh?

581
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,010
"Mack Daddy," huh?

582
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,910
God,you're obnoxious...
when you're so smug.

583
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,890
Oh,yeah? Well,that's a small price to
pay for the thrill of being with me.

584
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,920
Now,come on, I can hear the gears
mashing in your brain from here.

585
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:09,010
Come on. Tell me what's
up. What's going on?

586
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,440
Mr. Furlong killed his wife. He killed
Lynn's friend. I just... I know it.

587
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:17,050
Well,I know you know it, but the
fact remains, you can't prove it.

588
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,420
So I think you've just got to have
faith in the system on this one.

589
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:24,030
They'll eventually see what you see,
and they'll eventually catch up with him.

590
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,150
"The system"?

591
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,820
"Who was he talking to?"

592
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,440
"When did this happen?"

593
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,810
"Where did this happen?"

594
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,050
Settle down. We gotta get some rest.

595
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,800
"Settle down"? "We gotta get some rest"?

596
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,390
Is that all you got, Mack Daddy?

597
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,960
Oh,you want the best I got?

598
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:45,330
Well,then don't make promises
that you can't keep,Mack Daddy.

599
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:50,870
- Oh,no,no...
- No,don't write a check that you can't cash,Mack Daddy.

600
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,330
Look at those people
over there,sleeping.

601
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,610
How do they do that? I can't do that.

602
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,360
They're still saying
at least another hour.

603
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,820
They've been saying another
hour for the last three hours.

604
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:06,580
Did you hear what I said? Did
any of you hear what I said?

605
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,450
We heard you.

606
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:13,870
We all heard you: my wife,his wife, your
husband, this guy's mother, your business partner.

607
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,150
What was your brilliant idea? They
all go down in a plane together?

608
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,690
I mean,how do we make that happen?

609
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,880
MAN 2: You know, I'm a chemist.

610
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:25,970
You remember anthrax? After
9-11? How about anthrax?

611
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,270
Oh,yeah. Absolutely. Anthrax.

612
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,420
You know,I have some
in my garage at home.

613
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:32,740
You know what the problem
with this conversation is?

614
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,020
I'll tell you the problem
with this conversation.

615
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,720
You're all nuts.

616
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:40,470
You're all nuts, and I'm getting
more and more sober by the minute.

617
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,940
Hey,honey. No,I'm still here.

618
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,010
MAN 2: Hey,does anybody remember that thing
five or ten years ago with that aspirin?

619
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,240
Where somebody put
poison in the capsules?

620
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,860
So now you're telling me each victim
was killed by someone close to them?

621
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,720
Yeah,but they were all
in on this together.

622
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:13,490
And you know this because of this
conversation you... overheard?

623
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,770
Why are you so dead set against this?

624
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,810
Why are you so resistant to this idea?

625
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,960
I'm not stupid,Allison. We've
all been to this rodeo before.

626
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:28,000
The first thing we did once we had the five victims
was check out any possible links between them,

627
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:30,250
any possible links amongst
members of their families.

628
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,080
They live all over the state. They
have absolutely nothing in common.

629
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,870
None of them have ever so much as shared
a cell phone conversation or an e-mail.

630
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,860
I don't believe that.

631
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,370
Well,that's unfortunate, 'cause I have
to go testify in court in five minutes

632
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,380
and I don't have time to
stand here and argue with you.

633
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,550
But why don't you ask our good
friend Russell Furlong himself?

634
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,190
What are you talking about?

635
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,200
He's coming down here
in an hour and a half.

636
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,740
Get caught up on everything
to do with his wife's death.

637
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,630
The investigation at the manufacturing plant,
the interviews with the disgruntled employees.

638
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,120
Van Dyke wants us to really handle him,
do everything we can, so that maybe,

639
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:01,520
possibly,he doesn't sue the city
for locking him up last week.

640
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,630
Happy to have you sit in.

641
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,690
I'd like that.

642
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,790
So at this point, what we're
primarily focused on is...

643
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:12,100
how the adulteration could've taken
place during the manufacturing process,

644
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:16,630
even with all these safeguards
I just told you about in place.

645
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,500
That,plus employee interviews
and deep background checks,

646
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:23,000
I got to believe we're going
to turn up something soon.

647
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,640
All right. Okay. I mean,it sounds
like you're doing everything right.

648
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:31,560
So that's five police
departments,plus the FBI, plus the FDA?

649
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:37,260
Well,I agree,Detective. I... I have to
believe we're going to turn up something soon.

650
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,450
Well,we appreciate your
confidence,Mr. Furlong.

651
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,460
Uh,yeah. Actually...
there's one other thing.

652
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:50,360
Um,Mrs. Dubois here would like
to ask you a quick question.

653
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:53,530
Certainly. Certainly,
anything I can do to help.

654
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,520
Do you recognize any of
these people,Mr. Furlong?

655
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,400
God. Yes,of course I do.

656
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:04,850
I've seen their picture in the
paper and on television. Now,these...

657
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,390
these are the other four
people who died the way Kim did.

658
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,110
Have you ever met any of them?

659
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,550
Before they were dead?

660
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,450
Oh,God. No,not that I'm aware of. Why?

661
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,180
How about relatives?

662
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:20,140
Any chance you might have met a relative of
one of these victims? Her husband or her son?

663
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,720
- Allison...
- His wife?

664
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,000
His business partner?

665
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,240
Uh,what's going on here?

666
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,630
I'm starting to feel like
a suspect again,Detective.

667
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,010
I assure you,Mr. Furlong, the city of
Phoenix does not regard you as a suspect...

668
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,930
I'm sorry. I didn't get a
chance to hear your answer.

669
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,770
- Allison...
- The answer is no.

670
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,660
To the best of my knowledge, I have
never met these people you're alluding to.

671
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,810
I do not even know their names.

672
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,990
But I know your name.

673
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,940
I know who you are and I know what you do,
and I'm glad you're working on this case.

674
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:52,850
I want you to find my wife's killer.

675
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,810
But if you have somehow
convinced yourself that it's me...

676
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,230
or that I might somehow be involved,

677
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,050
I invite you,look into my eyes,

678
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,360
read my mind, do whatever it is you do,
and let's just get this out of the way

679
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:14,400
so that we can concentrate on finding
the bastard who actually did this.

680
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,700
Are we done here, Allison?

681
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,060
Thank you,Mr. Furlong.

682
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,500
We appreciate your... confidence in us.

683
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,260
Vision comes in many
shapes and many forms.

684
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:49,060
There's the kind of
vision our eyes afford us.

685
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,970
Fantastic! You look beautiful!

686
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,040
You look beautiful.
You look so grown up.

687
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:00,740
There's the kind of vision
our wisdom affords us.

688
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,880
Pay phone?

689
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:05,630
Okay,I'm stumped. I have
no idea what that means.

690
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,100
Well,that makes two of us.

691
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,920
- I love you.
- I love you.

692
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:18,080
And there's the kind of vision that
comes from things sensed, things dreamt.

693
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,070
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

694
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,350
At this time,TransCoast Airways
is pleased to announce that

695
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,670
the folks here at JFK have
finally cleared one runway

696
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,690
and we will be resuming
jet service this evening.

697
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:35,730
So at this time, we would like to
board Flight 414 to Phoenix,Arizona.

698
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,000
So when we get on the plane,
there can't be any conversation.

699
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,290
We can't even acknowledge each other.

700
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,490
Okay. Yeah.

701
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,300
You understand how it works,right?

702
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,320
No e-mails, no cell phones.

703
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,680
What are you talking about?
Nobody even knows anybody's name.

704
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,590
So I'm coming back through
New York next Tuesday.

705
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,230
This is the number of the pay
phone right outside lounge here.

706
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,500
I'll be there from 7:00 to 7:20.

707
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:02,330
Whoever wants to go through with this, just find
a pay phone wherever you are and dial that number.

708
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,180
This is nuts,you know?
What if I change my mind?

709
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,160
What if somebody changes their mind?

710
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:10,010
Don't call. Have a nice flight.

711
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,590
Yeah. Have a nice flight.

712
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,870
Yeah,right. A lot to think about.

713
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,920
Want to hear a funny
coincidence,Mr. Furlong?

714
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:42,360
Last January 16, there was
a blizzard in the Northeast.

715
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:45,570
A flight from New York to Phoenix
was grounded for over 14 hours.

716
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,990
You were on that flight, weren't you?

717
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,310
I might've been.

718
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,980
So was her husband.

719
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,960
So was his wife.

720
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,730
So was her son.

721
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,430
So was his business partner.

722
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,130
Okay. And what does that prove?

723
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,070
Nothing... yet.

724
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,110
But there are five of you, and we
know all the names, even if you don't.

725
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,440
One of you will slip.

726
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,970
One of you will crack, and
we'll be watching when you do.

727
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:19,510
And then there's the kind of vision
that comes from patience and persistence.

728
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,100
What do we make of the peeping Tom?

729
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:26,720
The nocturnal voyeur...

730
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:33,210
his eyes on the hunt for someone
to slip, someone to crack.
