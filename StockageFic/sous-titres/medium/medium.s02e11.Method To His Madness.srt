1
00:00:22,927 --> 00:00:23,563
You okay?

2
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,748
I think it overheated.

3
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:34,090
That much steam,

4
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:35,383
it's probably a good bet.

5
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:39,100
I started to call Triple-A,
and then my battery died.

6
00:00:39,858 --> 00:00:41,705
I don't suppose I could use yours.

7
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:43,719
Sorry.
I left it at home.

8
00:00:44,353 --> 00:00:45,324
But if you want a ride to town,

9
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,388
I'd be happy to drop you at the gas station.

10
00:00:56,872 --> 00:00:58,053
No, thanks.

11
00:00:58,931 --> 00:00:59,863
- You mind if I...?
- Oh, it's fine.

12
00:00:59,922 --> 00:01:01,577
My boyfriend smokes, too.

13
00:01:21,842 --> 00:01:22,596
What?

14
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:27,841
Sorry. It's just,
I'm an artist.

15
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:33,688
There's this project I'm working on you'd be perfect for.

16
00:01:38,954 --> 00:01:39,892
Is that your dog?

17
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:42,185
That's Buster.

18
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,180
Shepherd, right?

19
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,126
I thought you said you left your cell phone at home.

20
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:55,410
Hmm. Could have sworn I did.

21
00:01:56,188 --> 00:01:57,563
May I use it?

22
00:01:58,365 --> 00:01:59,297
Please?

23
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:03,572
Just about a few more miles to the gas station.

24
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:06,339
Still, I'd like to call my boyfriend.

25
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:08,334
Tell him where I am.

26
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:10,123
Tell him where to meet me.

27
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:13,879
Please?

28
00:02:18,714 --> 00:02:20,360
Not a problem.

29
00:02:25,056 --> 00:02:25,882
Oh!

30
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:35,221
You ever think about those Ancient Greek statues?

31
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,725
How hard it must have been back then?

32
00:02:41,865 --> 00:02:44,246
First, you had to find the perfect piece of stone,

33
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,469
excavate it from wherever it is you found it,

34
00:02:48,932 --> 00:02:50,456
haul it back to your studio,

35
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:52,434
I can't even imagine how.

36
00:02:54,202 --> 00:02:55,603
And all that...

37
00:02:56,278 --> 00:03:00,333
is before the artist could begin his work.

38
00:03:03,361 --> 00:03:05,159
My process is a lot like that.

39
00:03:07,732 --> 00:03:08,766
The hardest part?

40
00:03:09,662 --> 00:03:11,542
Finding the perfect canvas.

41
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,913
That... would be you.

42
00:03:19,188 --> 00:03:19,939
Ugh!

43
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:32,451
You coming to bed soon?

44
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:35,487
Just nodded off doing my homework.

45
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:38,015
I don't know how you do it.

46
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:41,035
I don't know how you look at that grisly stuff every night.

47
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:44,232
It's been a month now.
This guy's out there hacking up girls.

48
00:03:44,698 --> 00:03:47,552
You're staring at pictures of his victims,
hoping to dream about him.

49
00:03:47,973 --> 00:03:49,495
Me? I would have given up by now.

50
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,378
Yeah. It's my job.

51
00:03:52,468 --> 00:03:53,703
And by the way,

52
00:03:53,826 --> 00:03:54,883
it just happened.

53
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,077
What do you mean?
What just happened?

54
00:03:58,373 --> 00:03:59,443
You finally had one?

55
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,699
After all this time,
you finally had a dream about this guy?

56
00:04:02,887 --> 00:04:03,934
It was nothing big.

57
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,271
I mean, I saw the victim.

58
00:04:06,857 --> 00:04:09,353
The rest of it didn't make a lot of sense,

59
00:04:10,846 --> 00:04:12,636
but at least I saw the victim.

60
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:14,447
I guess that's a start.

61
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,039
That's it?

62
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:18,315
You finally have a big breakthrough,
and all you can say is,

63
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:19,496
"I guess that's a start?"

64
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,577
I would think you'd be more excited.

65
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:24,423
Yeah, I know.

66
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:26,212
The thing is,

67
00:04:26,397 --> 00:04:28,099
I'm not really myself tonight.

68
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:17,517
Patricia Gilmartin, age 24.

69
00:05:18,978 --> 00:05:20,780
Works as a hostess at a restaurant downtown.

70
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:23,753
We're positive this is the work of our guy?

71
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:27,067
The same brand of filter-less he left at the other three crime scenes.

72
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:29,232
Found them outside in the alley.

73
00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:30,801
Five cigarettes.

74
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:35,605
He must have been waiting out there for over an hour.

75
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:37,626
He's a patient perv.

76
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:42,300
I get the feeling the anticipation's a big part of it for this guy.

77
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:43,957
The way he hangs onto them.

78
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,254
Keeping 'em alive...

79
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:48,250
cutting them, cutting them,

80
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:49,402
cutting them...

81
00:05:51,137 --> 00:05:51,737
...until finally,

82
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:53,941
they can't bear it any longer,
and they just expire.

83
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,754
I don't want to find this one in a Dumpster, Lee.

84
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:58,122
I don't want to find this one in a landfill.

85
00:05:58,318 --> 00:05:59,930
If he took her last night, then she's still alive.

86
00:05:59,981 --> 00:06:02,884
If he took her last night, then he's still enjoying her.

87
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:07,183
Hang on. We need to find her.

88
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:08,290
Knock, knock.

89
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:09,683
Sorry I'm late.

90
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,009
My youngest-- she was having issues with potty training.

91
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:14,118
It's okay.

92
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:16,094
You didn't miss anything except your boss's foul mood.

93
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,320
The boys have already been through the bedroom.

94
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:19,477
There's nobody in there,

95
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,568
if you want to go in,
see if you get anything or whatever.

96
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:23,671
Sure.

97
00:06:24,823 --> 00:06:29,674
Oh,  remind me to tell you about a very
interesting program I saw last night.

98
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:31,076
It was the first killing,

99
00:06:31,127 --> 00:06:33,578
Kathy Summers. The girl he picked up
on the interstate last month.

100
00:06:34,464 --> 00:06:35,218
And?

101
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:38,480
And it turns out, he has a dog.

102
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,080
Buster. His name is Buster.

103
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:45,477
I'm sorry. I guess I'm missing the point.

104
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:47,621
Well, I guess I figured if we could find him...

105
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:50,962
Are you suggesting that we try and track down his dog?

106
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,564
Well, it's the only clue I got.

107
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:54,228
He has a German Shepherd.

108
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:56,373
It's likely he has a license, and if he does,

109
00:06:56,618 --> 00:06:58,143
his owner's address is on it,

110
00:06:58,194 --> 00:06:59,961
which means our killer's address is on it.

111
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:03,522
Okay. We'll definitely get somebody on that,

112
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:04,755
but I'm confused.

113
00:07:04,826 --> 00:07:08,024
If  you had a dream about the killer,

114
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:09,340
if you saw the killer...

115
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:10,277
But I didn't.

116
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:11,189
It wasn't that kind of dream.

117
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,234
It was more like,

118
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,638
I felt what he felt.

119
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:15,239
It wasn't so much about seeing,

120
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,307
it was... it was more about feeling.

121
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,860
Oh, I'm sorry. I-I...
I'm still not following you.

122
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:21,085
I don't know...

123
00:07:22,094 --> 00:07:23,131
the hacking...

124
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:25,311
The hack marks in their skin.

125
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,036
He considers that art.

126
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,109
He considers himself an artist.

127
00:07:30,462 --> 00:07:32,769
He thinks what he does to them is beautiful.

128
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,663
And how do you know that?

129
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:37,063
Because I was in his head;

130
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:38,026
I was him.

131
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:41,422
And that's what I felt when I looked at her.

132
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:44,112
But it's my turn.

133
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:44,988
There are no turns.

134
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,449
It's not about turns--
it's mine,

135
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,737
and you're not getting it.

136
00:07:48,788 --> 00:07:50,621
But you've had the top bunk forever.

137
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:51,954
That's because it's mine.

138
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,376
Just like the bottom bunk is yours.

139
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,447
Forever.

140
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:55,553
Mom!

141
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,755
Bridge, Ariel got here first,

142
00:07:57,806 --> 00:07:58,859
and if she doesn't want to switch,

143
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,971
I'm not gonna make her switch.

144
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:01,673
But that's not fair!

145
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:02,707
It's totally fair.

146
00:08:02,752 --> 00:08:03,456
It's mine.

147
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:04,613
And you're not getting it.

148
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:06,629
Not until I go to college anyways.

149
00:08:06,772 --> 00:08:08,118
Oh, and when's that gonna be?

150
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:10,281
In, like, a catrillion years?!

151
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:11,572
Two catrillion.

152
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:13,673
Sit down, babe. Hello?

153
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:16,227
Care to hazard a guess as to
how many Shepherds named Buster

154
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:18,967
have been registered
in Phoenix over the past 15 years?

155
00:08:19,046 --> 00:08:20,832
Uh, ten?

156
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:22,341
Try 34.

157
00:08:22,517 --> 00:08:24,631
I myself have visited 12 of them this afternoon,

158
00:08:24,682 --> 00:08:28,033
and have yet to come across a single owner
with a mutilated girl on the premises.

159
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:30,502
Sorry I couldn't give you something more specific.

160
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:33,208
Uh, it's okay. We all knew it was sort of a Hail Mary.

161
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:34,703
That said,
if you have any new dreams,

162
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:37,397
anything that might narrow down the search a little...

163
00:08:37,546 --> 00:08:38,569
I know where to find you.

164
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,664
Looking at Busters.
Wish me luck.

165
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:41,621
Luck.

166
00:09:19,255 --> 00:09:20,119
Here's what I got.

167
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,377
Guy's got a Shepherd named Buster
who's barking his head off,

168
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,622
a pack of filterless smokes
sitting on the front seat of his car with

169
00:09:24,673 --> 00:09:26,432
what looks to me like blood on the wrapper.

170
00:09:26,808 --> 00:09:27,807
Nobody's answering the door.

171
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:28,935
Am I waiting for a warrant,

172
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,030
or am I convinced,
based on the blood I see in the car,

173
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:34,519
that  the owner of the house is bleeding
to death and may need police assistance?

174
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:37,493
If you have a reasonable fear
that a homeowner may be in dire need

175
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:38,516
of police assistance,

176
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:40,235
than you have no choice,
Detective Scanlon.

177
00:09:40,932 --> 00:09:42,011
Be sure and call for backup.

178
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:14,017
Hello?

179
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:15,925
Three guesses where I'm calling from.

180
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,707
Uh... it sounds like a party.

181
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:21,585
Well, I guess you could call it that.

182
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,114
I'm at Buster's house.

183
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:24,897
You're kidding.

184
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:26,061
Nope.

185
00:11:26,646 --> 00:11:27,811
We found the Gilmartin girl--

186
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:28,822
alive, by the way.

187
00:11:29,262 --> 00:11:32,527
Turns out old Buster shares this place
with a sick twist by the name of

188
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:33,509
Albert Marcotto.

189
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:36,303
Is he there?
Did you catch him?

190
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,639
Caught isn't exactly the right word.

191
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,859
The M.E. is giving him the once-over as we speak.

192
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,550
She thinks he had a coronary sometime last night.

193
00:11:44,768 --> 00:11:45,803
He's dead?

194
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:49,388
The girl said he went into the bathroom at 11:45,

195
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:51,563
she heard a crash,
he never came out.

196
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:53,981
You still there?

197
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:55,543
Yeah, I'm here.

198
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,033
11:45, you're sure about that?

199
00:11:58,709 --> 00:11:59,600
There's a clock over the door.

200
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:01,253
She could see it from where he was keeping her.

201
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:03,027
Why?

202
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,080
It's nothing, it's just...

203
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:07,209
that's around the time that I had the dream.

204
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:09,937
Well, you can sleep easy tonight.

205
00:12:10,284 --> 00:12:11,603
So can the rest of Phoenix.

206
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:14,439
Albert Marcotto is a threat no more.

207
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:22,233
Can I get you anything else?

208
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:23,749
One more whiskey.

209
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:27,727
I know it's rude to count,
but that'll be your fifth.

210
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:29,115
You're right,
it's rude.

211
00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:31,374
Rough day?

212
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:33,618
No, it was a good one, actually.

213
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,211
I found someone I was looking for.

214
00:12:36,032 --> 00:12:37,010
Friend or family?

215
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:37,967
Neither.

216
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:40,721
And yet it's cause for celebration?

217
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:41,946
Absolutely.

218
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:45,622
So are you going to tell me who you found,

219
00:12:45,672 --> 00:12:46,967
or do I have to guess?

220
00:12:48,705 --> 00:12:51,569
If you don't mind me saying,
you have the loveliest skin.

221
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,773
Five shots of whiskey and
I start looking good to a lot of folks.

222
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:58,036
No, I mean it.

223
00:12:58,608 --> 00:13:00,561
You're going to be beautiful when you're 80.

224
00:13:01,185 --> 00:13:02,040
You know that?

225
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:08,191
That one's on me.

226
00:13:20,713 --> 00:13:22,994
Okay, are you sure I can't call you a cab?

227
00:13:24,486 --> 00:13:25,955
Just  get me to my car,

228
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,802
I'll be fine.
I swear to God.

229
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,833
- Okay. This you?
- Yeah.

230
00:13:31,674 --> 00:13:32,932
Let's get you there.

231
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,333
Okay.

232
00:13:45,795 --> 00:13:47,171
Okay, that tears it.

233
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:51,669
Anyone who can't even open their car door is officially too drunk to be driving.

234
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:52,894
So, all right,

235
00:13:52,952 --> 00:13:54,618
I'm just going to take these keys,

236
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,303
and we're going to find you another way to get home, okay?

237
00:14:14,725 --> 00:14:19,182
I know I shouldn't take it personally
when you leave our bed in the middle of the night.

238
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,780
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:22,387
I just had to look at this.

240
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:23,800
Of course you did...

241
00:14:25,184 --> 00:14:26,700
it's 3:00 in the morning.

242
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,186
I had a dream about the second killing--

243
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:31,207
well, the second snatching, really.

244
00:14:31,595 --> 00:14:32,834
Lydia Kyne.

245
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:36,285
Three days after she disappeared a homeless man found her body in a Dumpster.

246
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:41,608
Her face was cut up so badly they had to use her dental records to identify her.

247
00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:46,618
Wait a second, I'm confused.

248
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:51,609
Didn't you say before we went to bed that they caught the guy who did this?

249
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,836
That he was dead?

250
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:57,545
So what are you dreaming about?

251
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:02,452
It's weird.

252
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:04,905
It's the killings.

253
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,992
Well, two of the three, anyway.

254
00:15:13,036 --> 00:15:14,470
Except, when I see them...

255
00:15:15,972 --> 00:15:17,004
I am him.

256
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:22,240
I see what he sees.
I feel what he feels.

257
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,573
But now he's gone...

258
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,613
...and it's all over.

259
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,050
Joe, I don't know
why I'm being shown these things.

260
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:39,474
I can't figure out
why I'm being made to feel these things.

261
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:44,164
You know what you need?

262
00:15:45,585 --> 00:15:46,544
Sleep.

263
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:53,475
Dr. Joe says it's time to put these
gruesome pictures to bed and get some sleep.

264
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,836
Really, Dr. Joe?
That's the answer?

265
00:15:56,731 --> 00:15:58,322
I don't know if you've noticed, honey,

266
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:04,769
but you've managed to amass here quite
a collection of gruesome ginsu flesh pictures.

267
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,830
You'll see,
you'll like it.

268
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:10,112
You lay down,
close your eyes--

269
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:11,575
you do nothing.

270
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:13,483
Mark my words--

271
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,665
it's going to be all the rage.

272
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:16,891
You excited?

273
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:18,110
No, scared.

274
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,632
You  will teach me?

275
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:21,517
Don't worry,
I'm the master.

276
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:24,162
Who wants salsa with their eggs?

277
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:26,032
Me!

278
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,940
Do my senses deceive me,

279
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:33,855
or is my wife actually cooking breakfast?

280
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:36,904
What, you expect these girls to live on cereal alone?

281
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,317
Yeah, do you?

282
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:40,237
You get back to sleep last night?

283
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:43,896
Or did you feel compelled to dive back into your box of horrors?

284
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:45,424
The truth?

285
00:16:45,475 --> 00:16:46,908
I laid there for about an hour,

286
00:16:47,352 --> 00:16:49,943
then I watched TV till it was time to wake the girls.

287
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:52,655
Well, I suppose that's a start.

288
00:16:54,301 --> 00:16:56,317
Thank you for your encouragement, Dr. Joe.

289
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:02,165
Oh, I was hoping to get my hair done today,

290
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:04,311
but the only time Elaine can get me is 3:00.

291
00:17:04,362 --> 00:17:06,026
Is there any way you could pick up the girls?

292
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:09,957
What?

293
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:13,335
Starting a little early, aren't we?

294
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,232
And since when do you drink whiskey?

295
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:19,707
I don't.

296
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,289
I thought I was pouring myself some orange juice.

297
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:26,221
Al...

298
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:35,769
"Geronimo frozen pizza."

299
00:17:44,368 --> 00:17:45,140
Damn!

300
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,563
Can I help you find something?

301
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:56,748
Ma'am, are you okay?

302
00:17:59,727 --> 00:18:02,589
I'm fine;
I was just looking for Geronimo pizza.

303
00:18:03,056 --> 00:18:03,855
Sure.

304
00:18:03,906 --> 00:18:05,508
We have plenty of those,
right over here.

305
00:18:10,658 --> 00:18:11,479
Thanks.

306
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,103
Thanks, Mindy.

307
00:19:10,305 --> 00:19:11,918
You've been sitting out here for a while.

308
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:14,428
I thought you were maybe waiting to look at the open apartment.

309
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:15,701
I'm the manager,

310
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:17,375
I can show it to you if you want.

311
00:19:17,446 --> 00:19:19,385
No, I'm not here to see an apartment.

312
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:23,233
You lost or something?
You need directions?

313
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,074
I just...

314
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,648
I lost track of time.

315
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:27,607
I sorry, no...

316
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:28,829
I have to go now.

317
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:38,963
I'm home!

318
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:41,750
I could use some help with the groceries!

319
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:43,924
Hey!

320
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:47,261
Car's full of groceries...

321
00:19:51,614 --> 00:19:52,774
It's 20 past 7:00.

322
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,624
Well, it's getting dark so early,
I guess I lost track of...

323
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,330
Mommy,

324
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:02,345
the bottom of the bag's all wet.

325
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:06,618
Must have sat in the car longer than I realized.

326
00:20:08,771 --> 00:20:10,965
You  know, I've been calling
your cell phone for almost four hours.

327
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:13,316
I don't know why I wouldn't have heard it.

328
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,962
I must have shut it off without realizing.

329
00:20:19,747 --> 00:20:21,655
Ariel, can you get
the rest of the bags out of the car,

330
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:22,816
put some stuff away.

331
00:20:24,137 --> 00:20:25,960
Bridgette, watch Marie for a minute.

332
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:28,114
Mommy and I
need to have a talk in the bedroom.

333
00:20:33,434 --> 00:20:35,058
All right, first,
tell me you're okay.

334
00:20:35,186 --> 00:20:36,305
I'm okay.

335
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:40,502
You know, we've had these conversations
before about consideration,

336
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:41,579
about calling.

337
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,846
I know.

338
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:43,811
I can't find you,

339
00:20:43,862 --> 00:20:44,620
I don't hear from you,

340
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,542
I call the hair salon--

341
00:20:45,593 --> 00:20:47,558
Elaine said that you never even
showed up for your appointment.

342
00:20:47,611 --> 00:20:48,827
No, I know.

343
00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:50,334
No, I don't think you do know.

344
00:20:50,385 --> 00:20:51,484
For all your empathy,

345
00:20:51,535 --> 00:20:53,019
for all your sensitivity,

346
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,050
I don't think you know what it's like
to sit here with the girls from 3:00 on

347
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:58,821
and not be able
to answer the question "Where's Mommy?"

348
00:20:59,044 --> 00:21:02,501
No, I do, and I am sorry.

349
00:21:12,317 --> 00:21:13,747
Have you been smoking?

350
00:21:15,255 --> 00:21:17,571
Allison, what the hell is going on?

351
00:21:17,622 --> 00:21:18,573
I don't know.

352
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:21,166
I-I went to the supermarket.

353
00:21:21,305 --> 00:21:22,533
I saw this girl.

354
00:21:22,584 --> 00:21:23,184
What?!

355
00:21:23,227 --> 00:21:25,924
She was perfect. Just the sort of girl
that Marcotto would go for.

356
00:21:26,387 --> 00:21:26,787
Marcotto?!

357
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:28,872
What does this have to do with Marcotto?

358
00:21:28,923 --> 00:21:31,987
These girls, to him,
they're like canvases.

359
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:37,051
These blank spaces just waiting to be
turned into these beautiful works of art.

360
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:41,050
He, he likes their fresh skin,

361
00:21:41,185 --> 00:21:42,911
the way that they're
kind of innocent-looking,

362
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:43,979
not a lot of makeup.

363
00:21:44,877 --> 00:21:46,509
I noticed that her name was Mindy,

364
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,771
that she worked there.

365
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,346
When I looked at her,

366
00:21:51,764 --> 00:21:52,831
when I was close to her,

367
00:21:52,882 --> 00:21:56,303
I felt like I had found exactly
what I was looking for.

368
00:21:58,047 --> 00:21:59,416
And I couldn't let her get away.

369
00:22:00,262 --> 00:22:02,108
Sorry, Allison, why do you keep saying "I"?

370
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,438
You weren't looking for anybody.

371
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,793
But it's like I was.

372
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:09,179
So... I hung around.

373
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,722
I waited for her to shift to end and I followed her.

374
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:14,189
I followed her home.

375
00:22:14,714 --> 00:22:15,760
I sat there,

376
00:22:16,036 --> 00:22:17,492
my car full of groceries,

377
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:20,256
and I lit up Marcotto's favorite brand of cigarettes,

378
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:23,489
and I... I watched her.

379
00:22:25,535 --> 00:22:27,538
I watched her for hours.

380
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:31,439
You stalked her?

381
00:22:35,629 --> 00:22:37,107
You didn't hurt her,

382
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,707
you didn't touch her, you didn't
confront her in any way, right?

383
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:42,000
Allison, I'm baffled. Why?

384
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:44,243
I mean, why would you do something like that?

385
00:22:44,294 --> 00:22:45,235
I'm not sure.

386
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,022
These dreams that I've been having lately,

387
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,958
I just assumed they were coming from some victim,

388
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:55,632
Someone who wanted me to catch him,

389
00:22:55,717 --> 00:22:57,237
put an end to what he was doing.

390
00:22:57,288 --> 00:23:00,852
But now... I'm pretty sure they're coming from him.

391
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,942
I think he's trying to tell me something.

392
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,577
I-I just don't know what it is.

393
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:10,587
Maybe he's not trying to tell you anything.

394
00:23:10,638 --> 00:23:12,620
Maybe he's trying to get you to do something.

395
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:13,271
No!

396
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,524
Uh-uh, that's not what it felt like.

397
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,929
I suddenly became very interested in that girl,

398
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,580
and it was overwhelming,

399
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,014
and it was creepy,

400
00:23:24,415 --> 00:23:26,108
but I was me the whole time.

401
00:23:26,258 --> 00:23:27,472
I knew it was wrong.

402
00:23:28,128 --> 00:23:29,137
I knew I was late.

403
00:23:29,188 --> 00:23:30,488
I knew I should call.

404
00:23:30,728 --> 00:23:32,446
I'm not channeling this guy,

405
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,110
and I'm sure as hell not gonna start killing for him.

406
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:36,937
Yeah, but you started smoking for him.

407
00:23:36,988 --> 00:23:39,104
No, I smoked in college.

408
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:40,356
It's in my history.

409
00:23:40,407 --> 00:23:41,873
It's something that I would do.

410
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:43,427
Cutting people up,

411
00:23:43,478 --> 00:23:45,248
killing people-- no.

412
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,658
Well, I'm glad you're so certain.

413
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:56,881
I'll have Ariel call, see if she can stay over at Hannah's.

414
00:23:57,421 --> 00:23:59,521
Maybe Alan and Kendall can take Bridgette and Marie.

415
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:00,855
We can drive them there,
then I'll pick them up,

416
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,646
take them to school in the morning.

417
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:03,624
What? Why?

418
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:04,368
Why?

419
00:24:04,711 --> 00:24:05,729
Allison...

420
00:24:06,991 --> 00:24:08,429
did you hear yourself?

421
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,676
You just confessed to me you spent
the last several hours driving around the city,

422
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:13,819
looking for innocent flesh to carve up.

423
00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:17,058
There's no way in hell I'm letting our girls stay in this house while

424
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:18,940
you've got this guy in your head.

425
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,696
But, Joe.

426
00:24:19,747 --> 00:24:20,590
But nothing.

427
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:23,502
I love you, but, frankly,

428
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:25,198
you're scaring the crap out of me.

429
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,904
I'm sorry.
Just let me make some calls,

430
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,752
get them started packing.

431
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:33,068
I'll send them in there to say good-bye.

432
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,501
Meantime, maybe you can wash that smell off.

433
00:24:51,738 --> 00:24:52,799
Kids are all fine.

434
00:24:57,504 --> 00:24:59,538
I know you have no control over what's going on.

435
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,377
I don't blame you.

436
00:25:08,237 --> 00:25:09,409
Are you coming to bed?

437
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:45,468
I want to discuss something important with you.

438
00:25:46,062 --> 00:25:49,183
I want to discuss your legacy.

439
00:25:59,527 --> 00:26:02,816
The first line of your obituary.

440
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,257
The summation of your life.

441
00:26:05,308 --> 00:26:07,057
That's really what we're doing here.

442
00:26:07,163 --> 00:26:10,161
We're giving your life some kind of lasting meaning.

443
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:19,892
I can tell from your expression you're skeptical.

444
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:23,001
But you shouldn't be.

445
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,992
It's been several hundred years,

446
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:31,606
but everyone still remembers The Girl with the Pearl Earrings,

447
00:26:33,352 --> 00:26:35,737
Christina from Christina's World...

448
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,918
...Lisa from the Mona Lisa.

449
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:44,328
Great art is like that;

450
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:45,398
it lives forever.

451
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:47,479
And its subjects...

452
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:50,414
live forever.

453
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,173
This will only hurt for a minute.

454
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:20,478
You've got to stop this.

455
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:21,640
I had another dream.

456
00:27:22,251 --> 00:27:23,623
I skipped over the third victim.

457
00:27:23,858 --> 00:27:24,648
What?!

458
00:27:25,107 --> 00:27:25,948
For God's sake, Allison,

459
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:27,107
it's the middle of the night!

460
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:28,404
The killer is dead,

461
00:27:28,455 --> 00:27:29,928
the crime spree is over.

462
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:32,078
Don't you see? He skipped over the third victim.

463
00:27:32,328 --> 00:27:34,022
The third victim, Julie Paxon.

464
00:27:34,073 --> 00:27:35,163
He skipped right over her.

465
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,592
And had showed me the fourth girl, Patricia Gilmartin,

466
00:27:37,643 --> 00:27:38,640
the one we saved.

467
00:27:39,695 --> 00:27:41,603
I think I know why he showed me that girl in the supermarket.

468
00:27:41,924 --> 00:27:43,749
He wants me to understand what he likes,

469
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,658
what he looks for when he chooses them,

470
00:27:45,894 --> 00:27:47,985
so that when I saw a counterfeit, I would know.

471
00:27:48,315 --> 00:27:49,289
A what?
A counterfeit?

472
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,295
I don't understand.

473
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:52,371
Julie Paxon.

474
00:27:52,556 --> 00:27:53,776
Her complexion's too dark.

475
00:27:53,827 --> 00:27:55,011
She wears too much makeup--

476
00:27:55,062 --> 00:27:56,050
she looks cheap.

477
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:57,178
He would never choose her,

478
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,480
never in a million years.

479
00:27:58,768 --> 00:28:00,159
That's why I skipped over her,

480
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,828
That's why I didn't dream about her murder.

481
00:28:02,135 --> 00:28:03,639
Marcotto couldn't send it to me,

482
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,896
'cause he didn't do it.

483
00:28:05,273 --> 00:28:06,329
That's the message, Joe.

484
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,754
That's what he's been trying to tell me.

485
00:28:09,129 --> 00:28:10,483
He didn't kill this woman.

486
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:12,315
Someone else did.

487
00:28:15,245 --> 00:28:16,613
He's offended?

488
00:28:16,977 --> 00:28:18,409
I believe so, yes.

489
00:28:18,469 --> 00:28:21,459
Albert Marcotto took his "art" very seriously.

490
00:28:21,831 --> 00:28:24,139
When we attributed Julie Paxon's murder to him,

491
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,591
I think he took offense.

492
00:28:25,876 --> 00:28:27,270
I think he finds it insulting,

493
00:28:27,491 --> 00:28:29,180
which is why he's been sending me these dreams,

494
00:28:29,231 --> 00:28:31,577
so we could help restore his "reputation."

495
00:28:31,635 --> 00:28:33,260
Well, you'll forgive me if I don't lose a lot of sleep

496
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,420
worrying about the feelings of a dead sociopath.

497
00:28:35,644 --> 00:28:36,675
That's not the point.

498
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:37,969
Then what is?

499
00:28:38,511 --> 00:28:41,521
Allison, the inclusion of Julie Paxon in Albert Marcotto's body

500
00:28:41,572 --> 00:28:43,404
count was hardly done arbitrarily.

501
00:28:43,858 --> 00:28:47,057
He was blamed for her death because
she was murdered in precisely the same

502
00:28:47,108 --> 00:28:49,243
horrific manner as his other two victims.

503
00:28:49,318 --> 00:28:51,021
Nevertheless, I think we made a mistake.

504
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:52,666
You saw the bodies.

505
00:28:52,717 --> 00:28:54,225
You saw how they were violated.

506
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:57,537
It takes a unique capacity for cruelty
to do that to another human being.

507
00:28:57,588 --> 00:28:58,292
Wouldn't you agree?

508
00:28:58,343 --> 00:28:59,322
Unique, yes.

509
00:28:59,373 --> 00:29:01,007
Impossible to duplicate, no.

510
00:29:01,058 --> 00:29:01,860
What are you saying?

511
00:29:01,911 --> 00:29:03,860
You think we got some sort
of copycat killer on the loose?

512
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:04,558
Well, maybe,

513
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:08,547
or maybe it was someone who only intended
to commit one murder: Julie Paxon's;

514
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,553
someone who carved her up
to look like Marcotto's handiwork,

515
00:29:11,663 --> 00:29:13,706
so we wouldn't even
consider another suspect.

516
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:17,402
Someone's mimicking our serial killer
so precisely they even include

517
00:29:17,453 --> 00:29:20,501
the little details that
we deliberately withheld from the press?

518
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:21,900
The geometric wound patterns?

519
00:29:21,951 --> 00:29:24,622
The red twine in the ligature marks?

520
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:26,075
Cops talk to their spouses.

521
00:29:26,126 --> 00:29:27,541
Spouses talk to their friends.

522
00:29:28,062 --> 00:29:30,784
The wrong person could've gotten
these details any number of ways.

523
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:33,700
All I know is I've been
in this guy's head for a few days,

524
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:34,703
or he's been in mine.

525
00:29:34,754 --> 00:29:36,185
I've come to know his preferences.

526
00:29:36,282 --> 00:29:37,451
I know his taste.

527
00:29:37,646 --> 00:29:38,980
Julie Paxon isn't it.

528
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:40,093
She's not his type.

529
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,793
She's too done.

530
00:29:41,844 --> 00:29:44,322
It would be like painting
on a used canvas.

531
00:29:44,802 --> 00:29:47,404
Allison, look at this from my side.

532
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,315
The case is closed,

533
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:49,444
the crime spree is over.

534
00:29:49,495 --> 00:29:50,815
What possible incentive...

535
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:51,894
For argument's sake...

536
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,035
on the off-chance there might
actually be another killer out there,

537
00:29:55,741 --> 00:29:59,491
what would it take to get you to open
a new investigation into Julie Paxon's murder?

538
00:29:59,712 --> 00:30:01,505
Short of having another body show up?

539
00:30:01,976 --> 00:30:03,869
Bring me something
more than a bad dream.

540
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,583
Bring me proof--

541
00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:06,489
then maybe I'll consider it.

542
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:08,914
So, in your professional opinion,

543
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:10,966
there was nothing different
about Julie Paxon,

544
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:13,607
nothing that made her
stand out from the first two victims?

545
00:30:14,956 --> 00:30:15,836
She was young,

546
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:17,610
female, pretty.

547
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:21,362
I guess what I'm asking is was there
anything forensically different about her?

548
00:30:21,413 --> 00:30:23,276
Maybe she was cut
by something other than a scalpel,

549
00:30:23,384 --> 00:30:25,547
or maybe there's some way
to tell if the cuts were made by

550
00:30:25,598 --> 00:30:27,503
a left-handed person
instead of a right-handed one.

551
00:30:32,462 --> 00:30:35,501
All of the incisions
on all three women were identical.

552
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,426
They were done with a cutting instrument
that featured a blade

553
00:30:38,477 --> 00:30:40,265
no longer than six centimeters--

554
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,049
I'm guessing some kind of scalpel.

555
00:30:42,488 --> 00:30:43,468
And as far as I can tell,

556
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:45,433
they were all made
by a right-handed cutter.

557
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,417
So you're certain this was
all the work of the same man.

558
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:50,130
Why? Was there ever any question?

559
00:30:50,627 --> 00:30:51,776
We're just trying to be thorough.

560
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:55,663
Well... then today's your lucky day.

561
00:30:55,722 --> 00:30:57,423
This just came in from the DNA lab.

562
00:30:57,671 --> 00:30:59,509
It confirms that a piece of skin we found

563
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,791
under one of Ms. Paxon's fingernails
belonged to Albert Marcotto.

564
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:04,798
She scratched him.

565
00:31:05,183 --> 00:31:06,118
Apparently.

566
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:13,707
Hello, I'm home.

567
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,109
Hey.

568
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:23,928
Hey.

569
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:26,959
They're not here?

570
00:31:28,105 --> 00:31:29,077
They're not back?

571
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:31,765
They were, but...

572
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,055
But what?

573
00:31:33,937 --> 00:31:35,572
I want my kids back!

574
00:31:36,064 --> 00:31:37,018
Now!

575
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,415
No.

576
00:31:38,854 --> 00:31:39,915
Not just yet.

577
00:31:40,235 --> 00:31:41,337
What is this?

578
00:31:41,388 --> 00:31:42,111
It's yours.

579
00:31:43,224 --> 00:31:44,466
Or at least you wrote it.

580
00:31:45,065 --> 00:31:48,909
I found it
with all the other evidence in this box.

581
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:50,678
I thought maybe I could help.

582
00:31:50,729 --> 00:31:51,843
I figured I'd take a look in here,

583
00:31:51,894 --> 00:31:54,492
see if I could get a better handle
on what it is that you're going through.

584
00:31:54,603 --> 00:31:55,524
But then I saw that,

585
00:31:55,787 --> 00:31:57,828
and I figured out
I was in way over my head.

586
00:31:58,058 --> 00:31:59,799
And frankly, so are you.

587
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:01,345
I don't understand.

588
00:32:01,396 --> 00:32:02,167
What is this?

589
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,020
I don't know. You tell me.

590
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,415
That's the pad
you were writing in last night.

591
00:32:07,162 --> 00:32:08,048
I didn't write this.

592
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:09,000
I was writing notes,

593
00:32:09,051 --> 00:32:10,338
theories about this case.

594
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:11,818
Well, it goes on for nine pages,

595
00:32:11,872 --> 00:32:13,030
Al, all in your handwriting.

596
00:32:13,406 --> 00:32:14,679
No notes, no theories,

597
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:17,215
just "It was me"
over and over and over again.

598
00:32:22,795 --> 00:32:25,343
Doesn't... make any sense.

599
00:32:27,251 --> 00:32:28,499
I don't remember.

600
00:32:32,573 --> 00:32:35,247
That's all the more reason
to keep the girls away for one more night.

601
00:32:41,162 --> 00:32:42,438
It's just one more night.

602
00:32:43,783 --> 00:32:45,142
I'm sorry.
I know it's hard.

603
00:32:46,323 --> 00:32:48,628
I know you don't choose
to have this guy in your head.

604
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:50,129
He's a bastard.

605
00:32:50,266 --> 00:32:51,409
He's scaring you,

606
00:32:51,896 --> 00:32:53,145
he's scaring me.

607
00:32:54,377 --> 00:32:55,343
I feel like an ass.

608
00:32:55,394 --> 00:32:57,243
I spent the whole day defending him.

609
00:32:57,827 --> 00:32:59,253
Now even he said he did it.

610
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:04,367
The medical examiner
found his DNA under her fingernails--

611
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:05,470
Julie Paxon's.

612
00:33:10,509 --> 00:33:12,494
You've given this animal
enough of your nights.

613
00:33:14,595 --> 00:33:15,949
It's time you took one for yourself.

614
00:33:32,905 --> 00:33:34,891
Ladies and gentlemen,
place your bets.

615
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:36,584
500 on the pass.

616
00:33:37,888 --> 00:33:40,175
25 on the yellow,
three, four hopping.

617
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,500
Same shooter.

618
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:45,881
Lucky shooter.

619
00:33:52,796 --> 00:33:53,993
Seven winner!

620
00:33:55,995 --> 00:33:57,935
Well, looks like
it's my walking-away time.

621
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:00,697
Feel like you're cooling off?

622
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,097
Nope, I'm just getting started.

623
00:34:02,148 --> 00:34:05,342
I'm gonna put it all on
my Arizona boys to take UCLA.

624
00:34:05,641 --> 00:34:06,471
You better hurry up.

625
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:08,497
They tip off in about 15 minutes.

626
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:10,411
There you go...

627
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:13,978
$10,000 right there.

628
00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:15,588
And 25.

629
00:34:17,836 --> 00:34:19,699
Think I'll keep this one for luck.

630
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:27,923
You all right?

631
00:34:29,756 --> 00:34:32,323
No, I'm better than all right.
I'm great.

632
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:37,720
I had a dream... starring me,

633
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:39,319
and I didn't kill anybody.

634
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:42,077
Mm... Hallelujah.

635
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:46,763
I won a bunch of money playing craps.

636
00:34:47,114 --> 00:34:50,207
I bet $500 on the pass line and it paid off.

637
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,156
Wait a second.

638
00:34:56,254 --> 00:34:59,022
You laid $500 on the pass line?

639
00:34:59,211 --> 00:35:00,050
Mm-hmm.

640
00:35:02,073 --> 00:35:04,283
Since when do you know how to play craps?

641
00:35:06,477 --> 00:35:07,912
Since last night, I guess.

642
00:35:08,861 --> 00:35:09,710
It was fun.

643
00:35:10,169 --> 00:35:11,550
We should go to Las Vegas.

644
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:17,597
What?

645
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:20,417
You told me to dream
about anything other than Marcotto.

646
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:23,763
It's not my fault
my brain picked Sin City.

647
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,208
Al, in the 13 years we've been married,

648
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:28,573
the only time
I've ever seen you roll dice

649
00:35:29,474 --> 00:35:31,887
is when we're playing
Chutes and Ladders with the girls.

650
00:35:31,938 --> 00:35:34,519
And now, suddenly,
you're an expert?

651
00:35:36,736 --> 00:35:38,471
Which sort of begs the question:

652
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:45,822
Was it your vacation you dreamt about
or was it someone else's?

653
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,631
Remind me again
what we're doing here.

654
00:35:59,863 --> 00:36:00,977
It's a crazy long shot,

655
00:36:01,028 --> 00:36:04,572
but I think Marcotto wants me
to help him establish an alibi.

656
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:07,725
I had another dream last night.

657
00:36:08,582 --> 00:36:10,190
Took me awhile to figure it out,

658
00:36:10,241 --> 00:36:12,580
but I think
I was playing his part again.

659
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:13,786
I was in Las Vegas,

660
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:18,774
and I was putting a bet down on a
basketball game between UCLA and Arizona.

661
00:36:19,785 --> 00:36:21,139
Hope you bet on the Bruins.

662
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:22,646
That game was a blowout.

663
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:24,135
Come to Mama.

664
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:25,765
I checked the dates.

665
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,415
The only time those two teams
played was November 24,

666
00:36:28,466 --> 00:36:32,033
which is the day that Julie Paxon
was kidnapped and murdered.

667
00:36:32,377 --> 00:36:34,881
So if my hunch is correct,

668
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:38,802
Marcotto was in Las Vegas
the night that she was killed.

669
00:36:44,476 --> 00:36:45,405
Jackpot.

670
00:36:48,936 --> 00:36:50,595
Uh... bad time?

671
00:36:52,828 --> 00:36:53,732
Good time.

672
00:36:57,875 --> 00:36:58,661
Thank you.

673
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:01,624
Okay, well, long story short:

674
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,758
We have reason to believe that
Albert Marcotto was in a casino in Las Vegas

675
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:09,388
the night that Julie Paxon was murdered.

676
00:37:10,663 --> 00:37:15,072
So the District Attorney's office
was wondering about the possibility of

677
00:37:16,145 --> 00:37:19,408
you retesting the DNA that
you found under her fingernails.

678
00:37:20,726 --> 00:37:22,157
I'm sorry, to what end?

679
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:26,391
Well, clearly, Marcotto couldn't
have been in two places at once.

680
00:37:27,227 --> 00:37:31,592
So if we can verify that he was in Nevada
the night that Julie Paxon was killed,

681
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,483
then we have to assume that the DNA
results were a function of some kind of...

682
00:37:38,943 --> 00:37:39,879
error.

683
00:37:41,183 --> 00:37:42,135
Error?

684
00:37:42,278 --> 00:37:42,878
I don't know.

685
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:45,314
Maybe someone
accidentally mislabeled the samples.

686
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:48,491
Or maybe it was contaminated by
a sample from one of the other victims.

687
00:37:49,076 --> 00:37:49,713
No.

688
00:37:50,038 --> 00:37:51,224
That's simply not possible.

689
00:37:51,967 --> 00:37:54,729
I'm the only one who
had access to Ms. Paxon's remains.

690
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,889
And I can assure you,

691
00:37:56,269 --> 00:37:58,963
they were handled
with the utmost regard for limiting

692
00:37:59,014 --> 00:38:02,722
the possibility of molecular degradation
or cellular contamination.

693
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:06,928
But if the District Attorney
wants us to run them again,

694
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:08,089
I'll run them again.

695
00:38:15,887 --> 00:38:17,989
The M.E.'s giving him
the once-over as we speak.

696
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,624
She thinks he had
a coronary sometime last night.

697
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,277
M.E. is another way
of saying medical examiner, right?

698
00:38:34,643 --> 00:38:35,601
Right you are.

699
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,971
The thing is,
we don't want to retest the old DNA.

700
00:38:40,292 --> 00:38:43,032
We want to get a new sample
from under Julie's fingernails.

701
00:38:44,046 --> 00:38:44,934
Okay.

702
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:49,408
And we're gonna request
that someone else do it.

703
00:38:57,747 --> 00:38:59,040
Are you married?

704
00:39:00,184 --> 00:39:00,968
Yes.

705
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,785
Yes, I am.

706
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:05,053
Me, too.

707
00:39:07,955 --> 00:39:09,903
19 years, if you can believe it.

708
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:16,068
Has your husband ever been unfaithful?

709
00:39:18,194 --> 00:39:19,166
No.

710
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:25,657
They say the death of a loved one...

711
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:30,551
is the most painful loss
any of us will ever know.

712
00:39:34,949 --> 00:39:36,274
But they would be wrong.

713
00:39:40,102 --> 00:39:43,774
Knowing they're gone
because they chose to be gone,

714
00:39:46,574 --> 00:39:51,738
knowing they're alive and well
and much happier with someone else...

715
00:39:56,295 --> 00:39:58,177
...that's what hurts the most.

716
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:03,052
He was gonna leave me for...

717
00:40:05,817 --> 00:40:07,106
Julie Paxon.

718
00:40:09,745 --> 00:40:11,405
After 19 years.

719
00:40:14,437 --> 00:40:16,793
I went to see her at her house...

720
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:22,368
to ask her to respect
what my husband and I had together;

721
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:23,715
to remind her...

722
00:40:26,035 --> 00:40:27,583
that we were a family.

723
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:34,167
She thought that was a very funny...

724
00:40:37,006 --> 00:40:39,727
a very old-fashioned idea.

725
00:40:44,128 --> 00:40:48,627
You'd be surprised
how hard it was cutting her that way...

726
00:40:52,779 --> 00:40:54,764
...even for someone in my line of work.

727
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,517
So what do we do now?

728
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:07,189
She didn't even ask for an attorney.

729
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,252
Just walked right into his office
and said she wanted to confess everything.

730
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:15,121
Guess she figured it was just
a matter of time before we could prove that

731
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,035
she tampered with the DNA evidence.

732
00:41:17,551 --> 00:41:18,706
No, I don't think that's it.

733
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:22,340
I think it was killing her,
not just knowing that she'd done it,

734
00:41:22,391 --> 00:41:24,308
but knowing that
she'd gotten away with it.

735
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:27,501
I think she feels relieved.

736
00:41:31,502 --> 00:41:34,585
Do you think Marcotto comprehends
that he might have done a good thing

737
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:36,976
that he helped us catch a killer?

738
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:39,095
I don't think Marcotto cares,

739
00:41:39,146 --> 00:41:40,114
not about that.

740
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:42,852
This was about him, his ego,

741
00:41:42,903 --> 00:41:44,310
some sick sort of pride.

742
00:41:46,093 --> 00:41:46,954
Well, tell him thanks,

743
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:47,780
just the same.

744
00:41:48,046 --> 00:41:49,002
You can tell him yourself,

745
00:41:49,053 --> 00:41:52,174
'cause I'm done giving out
visitor passes to my head.

746
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,887
I really just want to go home
and spend some time with my family,

747
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,385
spend some time with me.

748
00:42:03,132 --> 00:42:04,197
This is nice.

749
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,038
This is good.

750
00:42:07,782 --> 00:42:09,586
Yeah, Mommy, this is good.

751
00:42:09,938 --> 00:42:11,157
I'm glad we're all together.

752
00:42:13,985 --> 00:42:18,090
Yeah, Mommy, we don't like
it when we're not all together.

753
00:42:20,157 --> 00:42:23,640
Mom? Mom?!

754
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:28,836
