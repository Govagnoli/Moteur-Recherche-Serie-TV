1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,100
I can help the next person.

2
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,600
now that I have your attention!

3
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,590
Ladies and gentlemen,this is a bank robbery.

4
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,220
If I could please get everyone on the ground,

5
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,290
I assure you we will go about our business
quickly.

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,150
You,get up.

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,670
Please,don't!

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,720
Not a word.

9
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,310
Give me the bag!

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,180
All right,people,you,

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,420
I need you to fill that bag with everything
you've got

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,050
or this poor girl's brains a gonna be
all over your floor.

13
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,950
Ma'am,don't look at us.

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,660
Look at the floor,you'll live longer.

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,830
Hurry up!

16
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,720
Please,ma'am,just look at the floor.

17
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,470
Michael?

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,250
Is that you,michael?

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,130
Does mom know what you're doing?

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,740
Allison,what are you doing here?

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,800
Is this your bank?

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,080
You go to this bank?

23
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,360
Yeah,it is,mr. Tough guy bank robber.

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,480
You look stupid with that thing on your head.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,630
Could you please not do that?

26
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,260
This is my work.I'm at work now.

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,470
I know you're my sister,

28
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,290
but show a little respect.

29
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,350
I wouldn't go to your work and make fun of you.

30
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,600
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,640
Thanks.

32
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,790
I loved the christmas card.

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,450
Thank you.

34
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,230
Yeah.

35
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,370
Those girls of yours,really grown up.

36
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,140
Hey,baby brother,guess who.

37
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,670
Haven't heard from you in awhile,

38
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,980
so I figured I'd give you a call,see what's up.

39
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,880
Girls.

40
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,990
Say hi to your uncle michael.

41
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,740
Hi,uncle michael.

42
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,350
Well,anyway,I'm at home right now,

43
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,710
but I'm leaving for work soon,

44
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,490
so give me a call on my cell when you get this.

45
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,820
I miss you.

46
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,490
Want to hear your voice.

47
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,100
what?

48
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,360
It's 7:00 in the morning.

49
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,750
Where could my brother be?

50
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,840
Michael?

51
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,110
Maybe sleeping it off.

52
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,310
Look what time it is.

53
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,460
What are we doing,guys?

54
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,250
Nobody's dressed.

55
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,450
Come on.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,910
short day,huh?

57
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,680
Armed gunmen at the phoenix west bank.

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,520
I'll be back.

59
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,870
Do you mind if I come along?

60
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,230
Be my guest.

61
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,710
Allison,you okay?

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,590
You look like you've seen a ghost.

63
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,660
Oh,sorry.

64
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,180
This place just looks familiar.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,870
Maybe I've been here before.

66
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,050
Three males in stocking masks came

67
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,580
through the door at 8:37 this morning.

68
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,450
They fired several rounds into the ceiling

69
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,470
to prove they were serious,

70
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,180
then grabbed a female customer,

71
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,090
and threatened to kill her

72
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,960
if the tellers didn't hand over the money.

73
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,500
Did they actually shoot anyone?

74
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,770
No,but they did take the female customer

75
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,940
with them when they left.

76
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,360
Have we id'ed her yet?

77
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:16,980
We're working on it.

78
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,810
The other customers describe her as a caucasian

79
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,710
woman in her mid-20's,redhead.

80
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,500
...Know why they took her out the door with them,

81
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,870
but we're still hoping they let her go

82
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,780
somewhere between here and
wherever they're headed.

83
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,840
Did anyone actually get a look at
these bank robbers?

84
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,400
Did anyone see them?

85
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:35,980
No.

86
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,040
Like I said,they were wearing masks.

87
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,080
So no one was killed,no one was actually shot,

88
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,440
here in the bank,I mean.

89
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,150
For the second time,allison,

90
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,120
no one mentioned anything about anyone being shot.

91
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,470
Doesn't sound to me like you

92
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,920
have anything to worry about.

93
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:54,950
How can you say that?

94
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,430
It's easy,I just think it,

95
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,330
and it comes out of my mouth.

96
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,680
Allison,you just finished describing to me,

97
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,930
in exhaustive detail,all the ways your dream

98
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,830
is different from what happened in real life.

99
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,590
In real life,no one was shot.

100
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,300
In real life,you were not there.

101
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,380
And in real life,

102
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,890
your baby brother is in sunny san diego and

103
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,320
nowhere near phoenix,arizona.

104
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,240
What are you worried about?

105
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,740
Anyway,I'm at home right now,

106
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,370
but I'm leaving for work soon,

107
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,690
so call me on my cell when you get this.

108
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,000
I miss you.

109
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,170
Want to hear your voice.

110
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,350
Hello?

111
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,590
Hello.

112
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,040
Sir.

113
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,470
Can I get a drink?

114
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,010
One beer. Here you go.

115
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,790
All I want is one lousy vodka tonic.

116
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,800
Hey,barkeep!

117
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,010
One lousy vodka tonic.

118
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,510
And put it on my tab.

119
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,220
Funny.

120
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,000
This is so not the sort of place
I normally come to.

121
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,240
I'm not even sure I know

122
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,560
how I ended up here.

123
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,060
So,now you know my sordid past.

124
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,640
Let's hear yours.

125
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,610
Okay.

126
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,050
Well, I, uh,

127
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,330
I growed up in the midwest.

128
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,020
I played some high school ball.

129
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,590
Never made it to the college ranks,

130
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,760
because I had the grades of a cretin.

131
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,580
I bumped around from job to job a bit.

132
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,450
One night,I got really drunk

133
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,680
with a bunch of friends

134
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,220
and woke up an enlisted man.

135
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,050
You're a soldier?

136
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,610
Was a soldier.

137
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,320
Two tours in afghanistan.

138
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,340
Got back last winter,moved to san diego.

139
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,510
Oh,yes,people like me

140
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,510
have endless possibilities.

141
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,980
If you're expecting an ambush,

142
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,140
I'm your guy.

143
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,850
Shooting,hand-to-hand combat,

144
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,770
peeling potatoes--

145
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,580
oh,yes,I have an extraordinary skill set.

146
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,910
Don't worry.

147
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,070
I'm sure you'll find something.

148
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,980
What?

149
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,120
Come on,you were thinking something.
What was it?

150
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,980
Just...

151
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,690
I'm sort of having a little problem.

152
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,700
An old boyfriend problem.

153
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,220
Anyway... not important.

154
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,650
It's a new day with new friends.

155
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,550
Besides...

156
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,300
probably not up for that sort of thing.

157
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,830
What kind of thing?

158
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,420
This old boyfriend need his potato peeled
or what?

159
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,510
Forget I brought it up.

160
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,760
Back to you and your sordid life.

161
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,470
Come on.

162
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,670
What'd you do today,soldier boy?

163
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,040
I mean,besides...

164
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,710
arriving in phoenix,arizona.

165
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,760
Hmm...

166
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,150
I call front seat!

167
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,760
You had it yesterday,doofus!

168
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,630
You can't call front seat two days in a row!

169
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,830
Can,too!

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,170
Hey,no you can't!

171
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,480
Hey,hey,hey.

172
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,990
Bridgette,that's my seat!

173
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,720
Bridgette,come on.My seat.

174
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,840
- Bridgette!
- No,no,no.

175
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,280
- Mine.
- Let's go.

176
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,410
No touching.

177
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,250
Mom.

178
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,820
Mommy,is that uncle michael in that car
over there?

179
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,020
Hang on a second,kids.

180
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,260
Michael.

181
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,700
hey,sis.

182
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,170
Didn't order a wake-up call.

183
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,500
What are you doing here?

184
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,710
What am I doing here?

185
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,490
What are you doing here?

186
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,510
Mom,is that him?

187
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,190
Is it uncle michael?

188
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,180
Can we stay home from school,mommy?

189
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,310
Well,you better wipe that look of
horrified disapproval off

190
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,090
your face and give me a hug.

191
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,960
Got impressionable young people watching us.

192
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,490
Tell me you're okay.

193
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,070
I'm okay.

194
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,540
Tell me you have some idea
just how badly you smell.

195
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,010
Hey,kids!

196
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,480
Your mother's making fun of me!

197
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,790
Michael.

198
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,980
sorry I didn't call.

199
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,700
I was driving all yesterday,

200
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,120
and didn't get into phoenix till around 10:00.

201
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,540
You've been out here that whole time?

202
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,310
I didn't say that.

203
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,520
Last call was around 2:00,

204
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,740
and I didn't feel comfortable

205
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,460
ringing your bell at that hour.

206
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,690
But,also,I'm not sure i could've found

207
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,920
your bell at that hour.

208
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,710
Wait a sec.

209
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,900
Did I forget the part where I ask if

210
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,120
i can crash here for a couple days?

211
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,050
'Cause if it's a problem...

212
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,680
no,it's not a problem.

213
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,800
I just... I need to drop the girls off

214
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,650
at school and day care.

215
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,800
Why don't you come with me?

216
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,740
I'll call in to work,

217
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,130
I'll tell them I'm taking a personal day,

218
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,370
and we can catch up.

219
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,300
Any other morning,I'd be all over that.

220
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,470
But I've been dreaming about lying prone,

221
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,380
not to mention taking a crack at your
indoor plumbing.

222
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,850
Oh...

223
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,330
swear to me that you will take a shower

224
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,100
before you lay down on my couch.

225
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,780
I swear on my children's lives.

226
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,180
You have no children.

227
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,790
But I-I want them.

228
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,470
I want them desperately.

229
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,540
all right,kids,I'll see you tonight.

230
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,830
Mind your mother!

231
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,160
God knows she minds me.

232
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,470
So he's in phoenix,

233
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,810
that still doesn't make him a bank robber.

234
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,570
I know that,it's just the timing.

235
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,480
Showing up on our doorstep
the day after a robbery?

236
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,100
Did I mention the enormous bag

237
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,710
that he pulled out of the back seat?

238
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,570
Was it a burlap sack?

239
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,310
Big black dollar sign painted on the side?

240
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,750
No...

241
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,960
joe,I got to go.

242
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,960
I'll call you back,I think something's up.

243
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,440
Just got off the phone with detective scanlon.

244
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,270
He thinks we may have found our missing hostage

245
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,090
from yesterday's bank robbery.

246
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,080
Two hikers found herin the desert

247
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,490
near route 10 a few hours ago--stark naked,
lying in a ditch.

248
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,330
Coroner thinks she was out there about a day.

249
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,010
Right age,right build.

250
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,330
But you're not sure?

251
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,000
There's some confusion as to whether
it's really her.

252
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,440
I don't understand.

253
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,830
Does she have red hair?

254
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,440
It's a little hard to tell.

255
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,870
Seems whoever killed her

256
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,300
cut off her hands and cut off her head.

257
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,570
hey.

258
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,020
Hey.

259
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,770
well...I don't smell anything,

260
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,130
so it can't be dinnertime.

261
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,440
No,it's early afternoon.

262
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,290
You want something to eat?

263
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,480
Uh-uh.

264
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,730
forgive me for asking...

265
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,380
but what are you doing here,mike?

266
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,250
I mean,you're welcome to stay,

267
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,680
but... this bag is

268
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,880
big enough to hold practically
everything you own.

269
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,720
So... are you visiting?

270
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,080
Are you passing through?

271
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,590
Are you hiding?

272
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,870
You know me,sis.

273
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,020
If I were to ask you,

274
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,220
would you be able to tell me exactly
where you were

275
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,770
at 8:30 yesterday morning?

276
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,520
On the road coming here.

277
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,540
Why?

278
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,090
Did you stop anywhere along the way?

279
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,850
Maybe at a bank?

280
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,710
What? No.

281
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,130
You need some money?

282
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,020
You're positive?

283
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,510
I'm positive.

284
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,170
You want to tell me

285
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,090
where you're heading with this thing?

286
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,270
I had a dream about you two nights ago.

287
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,470
I had to see if there was any truth to it.

288
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,260
You do know that you just used the words

289
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,470
"truth" and "dream" in the same sentence,right?

290
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,920
Okay.

291
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,040
So this dream of yours,

292
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,350
it hinges on where I was at 8:30 yesterday?

293
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,940
Well,8:37,actually.

294
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,440
What is this?

295
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,610
Just a speeding ticket.

296
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,330
Got it on my way out of california.

297
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,130
look at the time.

298
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,820
"Eight fifty-nine."

299
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,880
does that help?

300
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,170
Oh,yeah.

301
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,530
Absolutely!

302
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,450
I'm so glad you're here.

303
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,740
Mm.

304
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,040
Ooph-- you never did take that shower,
did you?

305
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,980
Uh-uh.

306
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,130
Oh!

307
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,520
Hello,everybody!

308
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,720
I'm home!

309
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,200
Hold that applause.

310
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,380
Dinner won't be ready for 45 minutes.

311
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,940
I'm making something special.

312
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,970
Well,it's nice to see you,too.

313
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,610
Where is everyone?

314
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,010
Homework.

315
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:02,960
Marie?

316
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,320
Coloring homework.

317
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,520
Well,where's everyone's favorite fugitive?

318
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,420
He's not a fugitive.

319
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,550
I was wrong about him.

320
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,400
Actually,he left for a date.

321
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,720
A date?

322
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,570
Guy's been in town about a minute,

323
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,440
he already has a date?

324
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,860
What can I say,we benoit kids
never wanted for company.

325
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,790
Huh. Wow.

326
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,920
We got all kinds of things boilin'
and broilin' here.

327
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,320
pretend I'm not even here.

328
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,570
I'm not staying,I just forgot my wallet.

329
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,670
- Hey.
-Hey.

330
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,800
Looks like you're going to miss a
hell of a dinner.

331
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,270
I know.

332
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,730
I feel bad.

333
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,320
Although,truthfully?

334
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,410
At this hour I'm in more of a breakfast mode.

335
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,070
Yeah. What a shock.

336
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,960
So,I guess I'll see you in the morning?

337
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,960
I will see you in the morning.

338
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,420
I'm going to go clean up,

339
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,840
say hi to the girls.

340
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,520
Hey,where's your date?

341
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,560
Lia? She's outside smoking.

342
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,050
Well,why don't you invite her inside
so we can meet her?

343
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,050
Eh,negative,sis,I just met this honey.

344
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,230
No offense,but I don't want to scare her off

345
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,030
by having her meet family.

346
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,800
No fair--that's peeking.

347
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,270
She's pretty.

348
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,390
Yeah,I know.

349
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,680
And for some reason,she likes me.

350
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,330
Go figure.

351
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,680
Did you find your wallet?

352
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,320
Ah,yes,I did,but,you know,

353
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,010
the funny thing is,though,

354
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,960
the damn thing's still... still empty.

355
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,740
Right.

356
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,030
How much you need?

357
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,520
Wh...uh... you know,

358
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,510
it's only going to be till I get to the bank,

359
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,460
and it's not a fortune;

360
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,180
we're going to that cowboy joint
down by the interstate,

361
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,460
which is pretty cheap.

362
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,430
How much?

363
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,500
Uh,forty?

364
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,880
Sixty?

365
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,220
Just keep this between us.

366
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,560
did you see the price of a drink
in this place?

367
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,800
It's okay,it's a hotel.

368
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,970
We don't have to order anything,

369
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,650
we can just sit here.

370
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,220
Yeah,but why?

371
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,930
You asked me where I wanted to go.

372
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,360
All right.

373
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,660
lia...

374
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,270
if you're going to let me take

375
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,660
you to a fancy place like this

376
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,900
but not let me spend a dime on you...

377
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,280
then the least you could do is

378
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,190
maybe not stare at other men.

379
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,550
Don't let the suit fool you--

380
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,880
he's not really a man,

381
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,770
he just impersonates one.

382
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,890
It makes it easier for him to steal
your soul.

383
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,220
You know him?

384
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,850
We worked together.

385
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,230
Traveled together for about a year.

386
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,410
He has a horrible temper,

387
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,690
but he's really good at what he does.

388
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,830
I thought he'd change,I'd change him.

389
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:23,680
But at a certain point,

390
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,700
you realize that's not going to happen.

391
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,050
And some day he might just get so angry,

392
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,100
he kills you.

393
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,380
Stupid.

394
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,420
Stupid,stupid.

395
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,350
But you guys are over now,right?

396
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,880
Oh,yeah.

397
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,910
Definitely.

398
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,460
I had the audacity to suggest

399
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,800
that since we worked as a team,

400
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,740
we should get paid as a team.

401
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,600
And I should get my fair share.

402
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,980
Uh-huh.

403
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,780
He seemed to think that living with him,

404
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,330
being with him...

405
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,820
sleeping with him,that was payment enough.

406
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,570
Who's that?

407
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,620
He worked with us,too.

408
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,920
There were three of them.

409
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,820
What kind of work did you do?

410
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,510
High finance.

411
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,310
Moving money around.

412
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,700
It sounds more complicated than it is.

413
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,430
Mm-hmm.

414
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,030
Okay,uh...I'm sorry,

415
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,680
why are we here?

416
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,330
Why are we doing this?

417
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,770
I don't want to spend all night

418
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,120
sitting here staring at some guy

419
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,400
that you say you're over.

420
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,610
No. No.

421
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,430
You're right,I'm sorry.

422
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,590
It's not what you think.

423
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,380
See,when we had our fight,

424
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,030
when he threw me out?

425
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,560
I never got my stuff.

426
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,860
It's still upstairs.

427
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,700
Everything--everything-- I own,

428
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,590
my I.D.,My money,my clothes.

429
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,080
Everything.

430
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,940
I just... I sort of thought that
with you here,

431
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,550
I might be able to work up the courage

432
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,310
to walk up to him,talk to him.

433
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,290
But I can'T.

434
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,380
He scares you that much?

435
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,940
You want me to talk to him?

436
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,300
No.

437
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,520
No,that won't work,

438
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,530
he's not a reasonable person.

439
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,180
Well,what are you going to do?

440
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,790
I don't know.

441
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,510
I know he's got an important meeting
tomorrow night

442
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,600
before he gets out of here and moves
on to nevada.

443
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,980
He'll be out of here for hours.

444
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,020
Uh,what are you talking about?

445
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,880
You talking about breaking into his room?

446
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,800
Damnit.

447
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,640
He's coming over here.

448
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,040
So.

449
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,400
Let me ask you a question.

450
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,290
So what time is this guy

451
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,600
leaving his room tomorrow?

452
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,960
I can help the next person.

453
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,570
I think she's in on it,sir.

454
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,280
Our missing hostage?

455
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,270
I think she's still alive,

456
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,410
and the reason we haven't found her

457
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,380
is she doesn't want to be found,

458
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,780
because she's part of the gang that
robbed that bank.

459
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,280
I had a dream about her last night.

460
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,580
She was taking a picture with her cell phone

461
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,650
of the security guard while his back was
turned away.

462
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,710
Well,that's hardly proof.

463
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:49,810
Think about it.

464
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,270
It's been 36 hours,not one single person

465
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,990
has come forward to identify the woman

466
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,080
in that footageas a loved one.

467
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,660
Cell phone picture,huh?

468
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,410
Actually,sort of clever.

469
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,630
You plant someone in the bank to let you know

470
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,720
when the guard's distracted so

471
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,750
that you can make your entrance

472
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,200
at the most effective moment.

473
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,350
Someone who won't put up a fight

474
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,440
when you suddenly grab them

475
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,900
and put a gun to their head.

476
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,240
Help convince everyone you're serious.

477
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,350
Ah,it'S...it's a nice theory,

478
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,470
but where does it leave our headless corpse?

479
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,400
Well,nowhere,except we can be reasonably sure

480
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,030
that she's not our bank hostage.

481
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,030
And where does it leave our robbers?

482
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,080
We still don't have a clue

483
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,070
as to who they are or where they've gone.

484
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,190
Not necessarily.

485
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,940
It was right where you said it would be.

486
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,570
And?

487
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,670
Loaded with prints.

488
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,210
Amelia purcell.

489
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,230
Arrested twice for shoplifting in 2002.

490
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,780
Almost had her again in 2004

491
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,720
for running a pyramid scheme out of
her apartment,

492
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,920
but the charge didn't stick.

493
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,200
Suspected in a couple of identity theft
cases in 2005.

494
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,890
She's a grifter,a con woman.

495
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,110
Here's the punch line:

496
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,490
Turns out we had amelia purcell's dna on file,

497
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,080
so we ran it against the headless body

498
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,270
in the morgue,just to rule out any possibility

499
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,390
that it might actually be her.

500
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:30,800
Only the weird thing is it ruled her in.

501
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,500
- What?
- Dna was a perfect match.

502
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,460
Dead lady in the morgue is amelia purcell.

503
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:46,680
The suite is on the top floor,room 1015.

504
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,030
The suitcase is like

505
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,210
a brown tweed with a tan handle.

506
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,650
Are you sure you want to do this?

507
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,420
Where do you want me to take the bag
once I have it?

508
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,740
Where you staying?

509
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,500
Hello?

510
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,380
You were living with this guy,

511
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,680
and now you're not.

512
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,160
Lia,when...

513
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,250
when I drop you off here at night

514
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,440
when you go to pick up your car,

515
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,430
where do you go?

516
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,090
Okay.Yeah.

517
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,780
You know what?I understand.

518
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,030
You just met me.

519
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,070
You know me well enough

520
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,200
to break and enter for you,

521
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,880
but not to actually know

522
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,640
where you sleep at night.

523
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,570
Makes sense to me.

524
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,660
Michael...

525
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,190
just wait here.

526
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,630
And you're positive this girl is dead?

527
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,630
For almost three days now.

528
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,970
Well,I'm confused.

529
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,060
Didn't you say that you saw her

530
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,050
outside of our house last night?

531
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,900
Yeah,that's just the thing.

532
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,920
I did,joe.

533
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,580
I saw her,'cause I see dead people.

534
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,200
And apparently,michael saw her because...

535
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,480
because like sister like brother.

536
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,360
I get that.

537
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,640
But aren't you usuallypretty good

538
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,280
at knowing one when you see one?

539
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,000
No,not all the time,no.

540
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,660
And this girl I saw at night,

541
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,090
through the window at a distance.

542
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,120
And my brother,he doesn't even believe in
this stuff.

543
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,250
He never has.

544
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,080
So the possibility wouldn't even cross
his mind.

545
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,380
I wonder if she even knows.

546
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,510
Well,that happens sometimes.

547
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,540
A person dies so suddenly,

548
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,930
so violently,they don't even know
what happened.

549
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,620
They just go through their life wondering
here on earth for awhile

550
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,370
why everything feels so funny.

551
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,290
I don't get that.

552
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,300
Wouldn't you figure out

553
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,970
pretty quickly what's going on

554
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,130
once you realized the living
couldn't see you anymore?

555
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,160
Well,that's just it.

556
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,240
Maybe amelia purcell never got there,

557
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,960
'cause the first person she saw

558
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,070
after she died could see her,

559
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,630
and has been seeing her ever since.

560
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,510
Are you gonna tell him?

561
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,410
You've got to tell him.

562
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,470
How are you gonna tell him?

563
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,850
No,no,no,no.

564
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:25,920
No,no,no,no.

565
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,360
Oh,you got to be kidding me.

566
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,860
Oh,god.

567
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,580
I know how this must look.

568
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,870
I can totally explain.

569
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:40,370
I was,I was just leaving this out here
for room service to pick up,

570
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,680
and the damn door slammed shut behind me.

571
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,730
Must lock automatically,

572
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,740
'cause...I can't get back in.

573
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,090
So,here I am.

574
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,490
No key.

575
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,730
No pants.

576
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,070
ma'am?

577
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,590
Oh,god bless you.

578
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,340
God bless you.

579
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:19,270
You are so gonna get a big tip.

580
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,130
...Tan handle.

581
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,780
Brown tweed,tan handle.

582
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:44,750
Brown tweed......tan handle.

583
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,850
You weren't supposed to be here.

584
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,830
Never seen you before.

585
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,470
You must be finance guy number three.

586
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,940
So...here's the thing,finance guy.

587
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,900
I just came for lia's things,

588
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,050
so it's kind of up to you.

589
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,500
We can mix it up a bit.

590
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,910
But I just got back from two years
in afghanistan,

591
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:31,620
so I'll filet you eight ways from sunday.

592
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:35,020
So my advice is you sit your balance
sheet ass down

593
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,490
and let me slip out that door.

594
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,260
And after that,if you want to call
hotel security

595
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,480
so they can fill out an insurance claim form,

596
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,710
that's between you and them.

597
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,710
Cool.

598
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,930
excuse me,you want to,uh...

599
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,400
what are you...

600
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,840
man,I just...

601
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,190
what are you doing?

602
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,530
It's just a bunch of chick stuff!

603
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,770
do you hear that?

604
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:24,770
Well,that just sounds like saturday
morning to me.

605
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,650
It's too loud.

606
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,860
Gonna wake michael.

607
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,170
Have you guys seen your uncle michael?

608
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,390
Everything okay?

609
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,620
Michael never came home last night.

610
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,030
So maybe lucky got lucky.

611
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,480
Can you get lucky with a ghost?

612
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,240
Think he's in trouble.

613
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,410
lia. You're lia,right?

614
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,170
You're michael's friend?

615
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,880
I'm michael's sister allison.

616
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,060
I'm sorry to bother you,

617
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,980
it's just I'm really worried about michael.

618
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,280
I mean,he didn't come home last night.

619
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,680
I was hoping he might be here,but...

620
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,750
do you know where he might have gone?

621
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,430
Damn,the sun's up already.

622
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,990
Lia,I'm really worried about my brother.

623
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,860
You're the sister that works with the
police,right?

624
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,230
I'm sorry,I can't help you right now.

625
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,290
As you can see,I've got problems of my own.

626
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,680
Just got to think for a minute.

627
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,730
How'd I get in this car?

628
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,440
I think I can help you.

629
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,730
I know what's going on.

630
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,720
I know how disconnected you must feel.

631
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,480
How you keep losing track of time,

632
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,440
you keep finding yourself in places

633
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,270
and not knowing quite how you got there,

634
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,440
but never being able to get
very far from this place,

635
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,080
from this bar,from this parking lot.

636
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,510
I don't know what you're talking about.

637
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:30,780
Haven't you wondered how you got here?

638
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,470
I mean,what is the last thing you remember?

639
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,870
I don't know.

640
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:42,020
Um,walking in this place,meeting your brother.

641
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,720
Before that.

642
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,100
Fought with my boyfriend.

643
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,700
Left our hotel,got in my car,just driving.

644
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,370
My cell phone rung.

645
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,360
It was him.

646
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,780
He was in his car,too,trying to find me.

647
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,850
We pulled off the interstate,

648
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,190
parked here,got back in his car.

649
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,690
He started driving again.

650
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:08,160
We started fighting again,about money,I think.

651
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,040
And then what happened?

652
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,460
Nothing.

653
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,800
We fought all the time.

654
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,370
Nothing happened.

655
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,310
Are you sure?

656
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,530
Don't you remember him pulling off the road

657
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,110
in the dark late at night?

658
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,510
He pulled off the interstate,lia.

659
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,140
It happened about 200 yards from here.

660
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,370
I don't remember that.

661
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,060
Sure you do.

662
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,800
So did he drag you out of the car,

663
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,790
or did you step out freely?

664
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:58,680
He... he pulled me out...by my hair.

665
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,650
I remember...

666
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,750
I remember hearing the sound

667
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,370
of the trucks going by,the whooshing.

668
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:16,410
And then I heard the gunshot.

669
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,580
It must have gone in the back of my head.

670
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:41,720
And after that...

671
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,660
after that,it doesn't matter.

672
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,470
After that,you met michael.

673
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,560
Yeah.Oh,my god.

674
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,380
What's going on here?

675
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,880
He sees me.

676
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,670
You see me.

677
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,920
Does that mean the two of you are?

678
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,770
Oh.

679
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:28,810
So,um...how does this work?

680
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,450
Do I ever get to see him again?

681
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,470
It's better than that.

682
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,960
You get to watch him forever.

683
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,310
But,lia,I really need to know where he is.

684
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,790
Know anything about money laundering,michael?

685
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,030
Starts with a very large sum of money,

686
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,010
money that can be traced,

687
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:56,450
money stolen from a bank.

688
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,330
It works like this.

689
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,330
You take your very large sum of
traceable money

690
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,400
and exchange it for a smaller

691
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,030
sum of money that is clean,

692
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,030
money that cannot be traced.

693
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,610
And we've got a meeting with a man

694
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,310
about that very thing in about...30 minutes?

695
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,530
And then I'm getting out of dodge,

696
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,470
so between now and then,

697
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,980
I need to know what I'm going to do with you.

698
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,050
I need to know what I'm dealing with,
mr. Benoit.

699
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,480
Are you law enforcement?

700
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,390
I don't know what you're talking about,man.

701
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,410
an accommodation can be made.

702
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:39,860
I'm prepared to reward you well
for your forgetfulness.

703
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,480
Hmm?

704
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,910
You know,maybe it was the shot
to the side of the head,

705
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,660
but I still don't understand
a word you're saying to me.

706
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,020
Right.

707
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,280
You just wandered in here by accident.

708
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,470
Slipped into the wrong suite by mistake.

709
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,840
I came here for lia's things,for her bag.

710
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,350
That's it.

711
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,800
Now I have no idea

712
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,180
what you're talking about,michael.

713
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,570
Who told you her things would be in this room

714
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,860
and that they'd be in that bag?

715
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,340
I mean,somebody must have told you.

716
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,270
And we all know it couldn't have been lia.

717
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,410
fella,I don't know who put you up to this,

718
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,370
but they're making a jackass out of you.

719
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,880
Your story is bogus.

720
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,200
Lia is dead.

721
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,310
And has been for three days.

722
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,270
Now,who are you

723
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,690
and what are you doing here?

724
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,460
She may be dead to you.

725
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:50,900
What?

726
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,650
Idiot,listen,

727
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,650
I shot her in the skull,

728
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,710
then,I cut her hand off,

729
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,370
and then,I got an ax out of the trunk of my car

730
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,610
and chopped her head off.

731
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,990
She's dead to me,

732
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,290
she's dead to you,

733
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:06,220
she's dead to the world.

734
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,730
And I'm about to do the same to you

735
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,190
if you do not tell me who you really are

736
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,900
and what you're doing here.

737
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:17,980
get him off me!

738
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,810
He bit me.

739
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,630
Oh,now I'm bleeding.

740
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,960
I'm sorry.

741
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,680
I would have told you,

742
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,300
but I didn't know myself.

743
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,200
Don't speak.

744
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,210
The police will be here in about five minutes.

745
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:50,710
Just repeat everything I say.

746
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:54,000
Just make it sound like it's yours.

747
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,090
You bit mine.

748
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,880
How about i blow yours off?

749
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,390
No,wait a minute,bobby.

750
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,940
I'll take a beating for you.

751
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,030
That's what we agreed to,

752
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,850
but nobody's puts a gun to my head.

753
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,020
What are you talking about?

754
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,650
I'm talking about our plan,

755
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,110
which never involved guns,

756
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,100
so get that thing away from my head!

757
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,720
I don't know what you're trying to pull,

758
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,110
but this ain't going to fly.

759
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,850
I'm talking about pittsburgh,

760
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,610
I'm talking patterson,

761
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,760
I'm talking about baton rouge.

762
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,430
I'm talking about the way you told
these guys...

763
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,050
I'm talking about how you told your
two friends here

764
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,350
that you were gonna split this four ways

765
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,860
with a piece going to lia.

766
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,120
When you and I both know you took 50%

767
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,720
and only paid them each 25%.

768
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,990
That's it!

769
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,960
I don't know who you really are

770
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,320
or who you really work for,

771
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,450
but I've listened to everything
i'm going to listen to.

772
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,400
go,go,go!

773
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,490
Phoenix P.D.!Everyone on the floor!

774
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,730
Everybody on the floor!

775
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,290
Michael benoit?

776
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,450
Yeah.

777
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,340
you don't call,you don't write.

778
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,920
Hey,sis.

779
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,670
Don't look so surprised.

780
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,520
I always wanted to get work done.

781
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,480
I think the doctor did a pretty good job,
didn't he?

782
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,130
The nose almost looks natural.

783
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,460
what am I going to do with you?

784
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,660
What are you going to do with me?

785
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,320
What am I going to do with me?

786
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,180
Listen,don't worry.

787
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,200
I'm not sticking around.

788
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,660
What are you talking about?

789
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,050
You are completely welcome to stick around.

790
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,710
I've been here a week.

791
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,910
I've already accumulated too many bad memories.

792
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,830
They say I can get out of here
in a couple of days.

793
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,120
I'll come by the house,pick up my stuff,

794
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,130
and then say goodbye to everybody.

795
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,790
I liked her.

796
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,820
I mean,I didn't get a chance to really
get to know her,

797
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,010
but I liked her.

798
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,070
Yeah.

799
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:27,020
I guess I'm more like you than I realized.

800
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,370
Yeah.Sorry about that.

801
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,300
Just so we're straight,

802
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:36,390
seeing ghosts,seeing the future,

803
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,900
that is the extent of our superpowers?

804
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,460
I don't have to worry about laser beams
shooting out of my ass

805
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,540
or leaping tall buildings in a single bound

806
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,420
or anything like that?

807
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,570
I believe you and your ass are safe.

808
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:48,650
Good.

809
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,240
what is this?

810
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:05,130
a reward check from the bank...$15,000.

811
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,310
I'm a thousandaire.

812
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,640
I'll be back to see you tomorrow.

813
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,110
Yeah,sure you will,now that I have the money.

814
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:14,440
Hmm.

815
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,900
I love you,michael.

816
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,100
I love you,too,sis.

817
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,290
I like your sister.

818
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,810
She's good people.

819
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,470
She most definitely  that.

820
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:47,870
I couldn't move on without saying goodbye.

821
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,220
And that I'm sorry.

822
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,450
I never meant for you to get hurt.

823
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,350
I know you didn'T.

824
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,080
I wish things could have been different.

825
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:12,210
I wish we could have met before.

826
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,950
Maybe in another life.

827
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,030
Yeah.

828
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,680
In another life.

829
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,910
just wanted to make sure
you were okay,mr. Benoit.

830
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,650
Not yet,ma'am.

831
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,930
But I'm getting there.
