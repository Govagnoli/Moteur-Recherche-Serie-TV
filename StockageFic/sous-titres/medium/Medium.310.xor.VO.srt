1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,750
Alison, Al, time to wake up 

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,340
Hi there doll face 

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,900
You slept through the alarm.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,270
You doing okay?

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,900
Middle of the night,you woke me up

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,030
and told me you were feeling a little stiff.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,260
Why are you looking to me like that

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,750
I don't know

9
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,420
Things just seem different

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,960
You seem different.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,140
Different?

12
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,880
What do you mean different?

13
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,580
Look at your face.

14
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,510
Look at my arms!

15
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,010
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,380
Oh,my God!

17
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,510
I think we're dolls!

18
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,510
We're in the middle of a family crisis.

19
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,410
I need everyone to pull together.

20
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,640
What is it,Mom?

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,780
What's the big deal?

22
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,540
Honey,I really think
you're overreacting here.

23
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,910
Overreacting?!

24
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,840
We're dolls!

25
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,480
All of us!

26
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,510
Al,honestly,everything
is as it's always been.

27
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,510
I have no idea what you're talking about.

28
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,210
I'm talking about the fact
that you're six inches tall

29
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,510
and your face is made of plastic!

30
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,380
I'm talking about the fact

31
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,540
that if I stripped off all
those doll clothes you're wearing

32
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,440
I'd find a smooth little nub

33
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,280
where your boy parts are supposed to be.

34
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,480
Dad,what's wrong with Mom?

35
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,810
She's just a little...

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,940
Nothing!

37
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,840
What is wrong with all of you?!

38
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,640
You act like this is normal.

39
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,340
We're human beings!

40
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,140
We always have been!

41
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,940
We dont live in a dollhouse!

42
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,440
Shh!

43
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,410
Mommy,you better be quiet.

44
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,880
If you make too much noise,he'll hear you.

45
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,180
What do you mean?

46
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,380
Who'll hear me?

47
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,980
Who's "he"?

48
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,240
You know who "he" is.

49
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,840
Ariel!

50
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,510
Joe,we have to do something!

51
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,510
Mommy!

52
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,640
Bridgette!

53
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,840
Joe!

54
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,840
We have to hide,sweetie.

55
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,840
No!

56
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,910
Please!

57
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,080
No,please!

58
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,810
Don't hurt my family!

59
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,140
Hey.

60
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,280
You slept through the alarm.

61
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,660
You doing okay?

62
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,590
Middle of the night,you woke me up,

63
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,240
told me you were feeling a little stiff.

64
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,840
Why are you looking at me like that?

65
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,310
You have,uh...

66
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,080
toilet paper all over your face.

67
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,940
I cut myself.

68
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,410
We're all out of shaving cream.

69
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,780
I was trying to make do.

70
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,480
Ah,poor baby.

71
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,740
I'll get you some.

72
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,010
I was gonna go by the
drugstore this morning anyway.

73
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,080
Thanks

74
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,580
You're a doll.

75
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,910
of your

76
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,910
"that I have longed long to redeliver,

77
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,380
and I pray now that you receive them. "

78
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,540
"No,not I. I never gave you aught. "

79
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,480
"My honored lord,you
know right well you did. "

80
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,640
This play is stupid.

81
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,010
And how am I supposed
to learn this for class

82
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,240
if Bridgette keeps tickling Marie?

83
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,440
Hey,Bridge,Ariel's trying to concentrate.

84
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,620
Stop tickling your sister.

85
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,700
I'm not tickling her.

86
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,830
I'm checking to see if she has chicken pox.

87
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,240
Why would you be doing that?

88
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,140
Well,I had this dream last night

89
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,010
that Marie was all covered in chickenpox.

90
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,710
But it looks like she's okay.

91
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,780
Dad...

92
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,380
Hi,sweetie.

93
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,810
You feeling okay?

94
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,110
<i>I cannot get chicken pox,not now.</i>

95
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,410
I've managed to get through

96
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,640
almost four decades on this planet

97
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,980
without getting chicken pox.

98
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,540
I dodged the bullet when
Ariel and Bridgette had it.

99
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,180
And right now,this month,I'm looking at

100
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,940
an uninterrupted string of 14-hour days...

101
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,610
so that we can make our
deadline on the Haspel project.

102
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,510
I just don't feel like
calling my boss and telling him

103
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,440
I can't pitch in because
I came down with a disease

104
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,210
that's usually associated
with kindergartners.

105
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,380
What is so funny?

106
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,680
Joe,Joe,you silly scientist,you.

107
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,880
You're worried about nothing,literally.

108
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,810
There's a vaccine for chicken pox now.

109
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,110
Marie had it almost six months ago.

110
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,680
There's a vaccine?

111
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,780
Marie had it?

112
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,910
Same time she got her measles shot.

113
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,410
Uh-huh.

114
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,480
Huh.

115
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,380
Oh,wait a second. Wait.

116
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,340
Actually,I think I do see some marks.

117
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,110
Some red spots.

118
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,940
Toilet paperus poxus.

119
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,710
Healed.

120
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,710
Funny.

121
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,680
No!

122
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,980
Please! No!

123
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,980
Excuse me.

124
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,540
Where are your parents?

125
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,740
I'm so cold,Daddy!

126
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,040
I want to get out!

127
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,410
Oliver,don't complain.

128
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,710
This is for your own good.

129
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,710
We don't complain about things
that are good for us,right?

130
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,410
<i>Oliver.</i>

131
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,240
Oliver. Son,I'm ready to go.

132
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,580
Why are you just standing there?

133
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,410
Come on. Come here.

134
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,410
Kids.

135
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
They didn't have it.

136
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,480
We got to go somewhere else.

137
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,910
You look good,Daddy.

138
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,010
I know you've been sick,but
it doesn't really show.

139
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,140
I mean...

140
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,910
you lost some weight and you look good.

141
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,910
That's not why you're here.

142
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,510
You want the truth?

143
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,940
You want the awful truth?

144
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,680
It had nothing to do with you.

145
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,510
And it's killing Mom that
you take this on every year,

146
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,440
that you wear it like...

147
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,980
like a coat of shame.

148
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,580
All she wants to do is
talk and cry and laugh

149
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,110
and look at pictures,and all you want to do

150
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,780
is climb into your own darkness by yourself.

151
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,240
Two years of college...

152
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,110
now you know everything.

153
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,410
20 years of you.

154
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
And,yeah,I do know everything.

155
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,680
I'm sorry to interrupt,sir,

156
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,910
but if you don't leave now,

157
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,740
you're going to be late for court.

158
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,210
What did your boss say?

159
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,480
I told you.

160
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,610
I couldn't get to him.

161
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,010
He was behind closed doors

162
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,640
and then he was in court all day.

163
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,940
Had Scanlon run the plates.

164
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,280
There was nothing there.

165
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,840
I assume he has a name,though.

166
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,640
Michael Levitt.

167
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,140
Never been arrested.

168
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,410
Child Protective Services has
never been called to his house.

169
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,680
Are you even listening to me?

170
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,310
I knew it. Look at this.

171
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,910
I knew I'd read this somewhere. What?

172
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,810
Even if you've been... even
if you've been vaccinated,

173
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,040
there's still a one-in-ten
chance of getting chicken pox.

174
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,840
And if you get it,you're contagious.

175
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,080
Who's the silly scientist now?

176
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,250
Well,congratulations.

177
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,740
So what are we gonna
do,put Marie in quarantine

178
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,880
until your project's over?

179
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,010
Is there a reasonably
priced facility nearby?

180
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,410
You okay over there?

181
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,740
I need to visit Arianna next week.

182
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,780
I need to.

183
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,440
Okay.

184
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,310
I don't know if I can make that work.

185
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,480
I have court.

186
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,680
There are motions pending.

187
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,580
You're her father.

188
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,780
Don't you want to see her?

189
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,780
Don't you need to be near her?

190
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,240
Well,I do.

191
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,540
It's been six years.

192
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,910
I want to go visit my daughter's grave.

193
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,240
Shh! He'll hear you.

194
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,940
Shh!

195
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,140
Oliver...

196
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,140
you were supposed to be asleep an hour ago.

197
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,340
You know the rules about bedtime.

198
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,910
And you know what happens
when you break them.

199
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,340
You get one minute.

200
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,340
No,Daddy.

201
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,340
I'm sorry.

202
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,980
I wasn't tired.

203
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,010
Then you lay there until you get tired.

204
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,110
You don't sit up talking to Maggie.

205
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,410
Now,give her to me.

206
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,480
But I like her.

207
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,340
It's a girl's toy,Oliver.

208
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,910
Now,give her to me.

209
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,040
Hello.

210
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,540
Allison,it's Lee Scanlon.

211
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,640
Sorry to wake you.

212
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,640
No,no.

213
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,880
I'm glad you called,actually.

214
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,610
I wanted to talk to you about the man

215
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,040
we were checking into yesterday
- Michael Levitt.

216
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,640
Funny. That's who I'm calling about.

217
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,080
Oh,no.

218
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,210
Am I too late?

219
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,780
What is it? What happened?

220
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,210
Is the little boy all right?

221
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,080
Well,if you call losing your
father to a tragic accident

222
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,020
....

223
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,750
sometime before dawn.

224
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,350
She couldn't get back
down and she was crying.

225
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,120
It was about 6:00 in the morning.

226
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,740
Michael was trying to get her down...

227
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,640
...when he fell off the ladder.

228
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,810
Uh,Ms. Levitt,this is Allison Dubois.

229
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,120
She's here as a representative

230
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,490
of the District Attorney's office.

231
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,850
Allison,this is Sarah Jane Levitt.

232
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:05,250
This is the woman who made
the 911 call this morning.

233
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,490
I'm so sorry for your loss.

234
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,250
Thank you.

235
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,750
I was,um,back in the kitchen

236
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,350
making coffee when I heard... the scream.

237
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:28,470
I ran out to the patio,and
he was just lying there.

238
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,290
Sorry.

239
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,190
What about your son?

240
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,590
Is there any chance he
might have witnessed it?

241
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,580
Oliver's not my son.

242
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,290
He's,he's my nephew.

243
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,290
I'm just visiting here

244
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,120
for a few days.

245
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:47,700
Oliver...

246
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,120
didn't see anything,thank God.

247
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,430
He was asleep in his room when it happened.

248
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,890
He doesn't even know his father's gone yet.

249
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,990
I told him to wait in the playroom...

250
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,030
Shh! Quiet.

251
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,790
...until,uh,we're done here.

252
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,490
Shh! I'm not looking forward to telling him.

253
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,660
Shh! He'll hear you.

254
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,160
Forgive me.

255
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,360
Is there a restroom I could use?

256
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,460
What are you talking about?

257
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,260
Now we can play with each other.

258
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,660
Now there's no one to get mad at us,Oliver.

259
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,660
But I don't feel like playing right now.

260
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,460
Oliver?

261
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,960
Are you alone?

262
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,130
I thought I heard talking.

263
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,060
Voices.

264
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,890
Are you all by yourself?

265
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,890
My dad's dead,isn't he?

266
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,390
My aunt Sarah Jane told
me he had an accident,

267
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,430
but I think he's dead.

268
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,430
Oliver?

269
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,760
Hello.

270
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,230
Again.

271
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,390
Um... I take it you found what you needed.

272
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,590
Yeah,I'm sorry. I just heard Oliver.

273
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,660
I poked my head in to
make sure he was all right.

274
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,690
I'm,um- I'm all finished

275
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,760
with the,with the police
and the ambulance people now,

276
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,760
so come on,sweetie.

277
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,290
Ooh!

278
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,760
Let's show this nice lady out,

279
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,390
and then we'll go down to the kitchen

280
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,460
and then we'll be able to talk a little bit.

281
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,490
Okay? Okay.

282
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,530
Lily.

283
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,530
It's me.

284
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,960
Made it all the way to work

285
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,290
and I realized I forgot my damn pills again.

286
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,290
Here they are.

287
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,660
You must be Manuel.

288
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,190
I've heard a great deal about you.

289
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,160
I'm sorry. You,you are...?

290
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,630
Franklin,will this do?

291
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,360
Manny.

292
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,490
Dr. Franklin Gates.

293
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,030
I'm with the University of New Mexico.

294
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,460
I'm Manuel Devalos and this is my wife Lily,

295
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,760
but then,you seem to know that.

296
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,790
I'm so sorry,Manny.

297
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,460
I didn't want it to go like this.

298
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,460
It's all right,Lily.

299
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,990
Everything happens for a reason.

300
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,660
Even forgetting one's pills

301
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,460
may not necessarily be the random event

302
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,930
it appears. Okay.

303
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,030
Forgive me,I don't mean to be rude,

304
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,160
but I'm still unclear as just to who you are

305
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,590
and what you're doing in my home.

306
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,230
I gather you're a doctor of some sort.

307
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,690
Exactly who and what are you here to treat?

308
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,830
I'm a doctor of philosophy.

309
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,930
I also have some experience
working as a conduit

310
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,630
between the living and the dead.

311
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,760
Your wife contacted me

312
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,830
and asked if I might be interested

313
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,560
in helping her communicate

314
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,090
with your daughter.

315
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,990
Manuel.

316
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,990
I beg of you.

317
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,530
I know how silly this sounds,

318
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,190
and I know how much it pains
you to even think about it,

319
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,830
but...

320
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,390
I must say,our other sessions
have been quite remarkable.

321
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,030
We were just putting together a few things

322
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,290
that Lily felt were
special to your daughter.

323
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,460
White zinnias.

324
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,390
Franklin brought them.

325
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,030
Wasn't that thoughtful?

326
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,790
I told him they were her favorites.

327
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,440
They're not real.

328
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,710
Of course not.It's
too early for zinnias.

329
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,830
She's here...

330
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,630
and she'd really like you to stay.

331
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,130
Are you referring to my daughter?

332
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,190
Of course I am.

333
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,190
Please.

334
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,490
How much do you charge for this...

335
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,760
sort of... blasphemy?

336
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,760
Excuse me?

337
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,890
What's your fee schedule?

338
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,830
I don't charge a fee.

339
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,190
You do this out of the
kindness of your heart?

340
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,430
Your wife has agreed to an honorarium.

341
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:55,430
$300 an hour,although
that's half what I usually...

342
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,260
Lily,honey,this man is
as phony as these flowers.

343
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,330
Manny...

344
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,330
Lily.

345
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,160
Our daughter is not coming back

346
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,390
for a pleasant chat about the ribbon she won

347
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,130
on Sports Night in tenth grade.

348
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,760
Our daughter died with her heart

349
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,560
full of despair,sitting
in a running automobile

350
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,830
in a locked garage in upstate New York

351
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,630
on a freezing winter night.

352
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:25,430
She tried calling you... twice.

353
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,860
She tried calling me six times.

354
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,260
She didn't leave a note.

355
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,790
This is beautiful.

356
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,190
Did my wife mention to you

357
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,060
that I am the District
Attorney of the city of Phoenix?

358
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,230
She mentioned you worked in government.

359
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,690
You leave now and you lose my phone number.

360
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,860
I won't press charges.

361
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,660
If you're still standing
there in 30 seconds,

362
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,360
the deal is off.

363
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,330
I miss Daddy.

364
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,890
Bridge,don't be silly.

365
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,130
Daddy's just working late.

366
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,090
He'll be here when you wake up tomorrow.

367
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,760
Hmm.

368
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,230
How about I give you two
kisses to pick up the slack?

369
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,930
Hmm?

370
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,260
That's one.

371
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,890
That's two.

372
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,190
Hey,are you trying to steal

373
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,160
my kissing duties?

374
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,490
Man works late one night,

375
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,930
and then when his back is turned,

376
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,830
his wife tries to steal his kissing duties.

377
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,830
Hmm... my humblest apologies.

378
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,930
Shan't happen again.

379
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,030
Yeah,it better not.

380
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,130
Is Daddy home?

381
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,390
He sure is.

382
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,390
Lucky you woke up.

383
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,730
You almost missed your good night kiss.

384
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,960
Hi,sweetie.

385
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,160
What are you doing? Nothing.

386
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,390
Checking. Checking what?

387
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,630
Checking nothing.

388
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,630
Give her a kiss.

389
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,930
She wants a kiss.

390
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,290
Kiss,Daddy.

391
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,290
Aw...

392
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,460
Come here,little one.

393
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,460
Ugh!

394
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,590
You're strangling me.

395
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,290
My neck.

396
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,960
Night,ladies.

397
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,890
Ain't he something?

398
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,830
That was hard for me,Oliver.

399
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,630
It's hard for everyone when
you don't follow the rules.

400
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,760
There you go.

401
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,460
I'm going to try and put this behind us.

402
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,060
I think you should do the same.

403
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,560
Just stay in bed and go to sleep.

404
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,830
He'll never stop,Oliver.

405
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,460
You know that.

406
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,830
Shh!

407
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,090
I have to go to sleep.

408
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,560
You know he won't stop.

409
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,960
Not until he kills you...

410
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,690
or you kill him.

411
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,160
What are you talking about?

412
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,630
I wouldn't do that.

413
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,460
I couldn't do that.

414
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,260
Oh,I'll bet you could.

415
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,730
Ugh.

416
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,470
??????

417
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,020
About your suspicion

418
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,740
that a homicidal doll helped
a six-year-old,65-pound boy

419
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,440
kill a full-grown adult male?

420
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,740
I'd say that's an absolutely
prudent course of action.

421
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,340
Okay,forget about the doll.

422
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,240
Leave the doll out of this.

423
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,140
Imagine for a second that

424
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,770
that little boy did pull the ladder away

425
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,500
from underneath his father.

426
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,540
Can you blame him?

427
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,770
You know what?

428
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,870
I'm not in a position to blame him or not.

429
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,270
And neither are you.

430
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,370
I mean we don't even know for a fact

431
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,600
that his father was abusing him.

432
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,270
Just like you don't know for a fact

433
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,000
that the little kid had anything
to do with his father's death.

434
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,670
I mean didn't you say

435
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,170
that the police had already
declared the death accidental?

436
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,900
So what's your point?

437
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,370
My point is the reason not
to discuss this with your boss

438
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,140
is because there isn't anything
really worth discussing,

439
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,470
not because you think

440
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,440
the little boy might have
been actually justified

441
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,270
in taking his father's life.

442
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,370
I mean,you're the judge and jury now?

443
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,400
That can't really be what you meant.

444
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,600
I don't know.

445
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,870
I don't know what I meant.

446
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,770
Besides it's like you said.

447
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,440
There's nothing to discuss.

448
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,970
The man's death was an accident.

449
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,800
Where you going?

450
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,110
To bed. I...

451
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,430
I just made the coffee.

452
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,980
Wait a second.

453
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,240
I need you to feel my head.

454
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,870
Well,you're fine.

455
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,300
<i>I need to ask you something,</i>

456
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,840
but I'm afraid it might sound a bit...

457
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,100
abstract.

458
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,970
Okay.

459
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,500
Do you sense...

460
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,670
any kind of energy in this room?

461
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,470
A presence of any kind?

462
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,900
Are you asking me if your office is haunted?

463
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,540
About two and a half years
before you started working here,

464
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,970
my daughter took her own life.

465
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,500
She was 20 at the time.

466
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,700
Every year around this time,I...

467
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:58,140
Two days ago she was sitting
right where you are now.

468
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,340
I'm sorry. I don't see anything.

469
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,700
I don't feel anything.

470
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,400
Of course not.

471
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,970
The truth is there's
nothing she could really say.

472
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,600
I mean when a child kills themselves

473
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,040
they really do get the last word.

474
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,800
That's sorta the point,isn't it?

475
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,760
Don't blame yourself.

476
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,700
She wouldn't want you to do that.

477
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,070
Who,who can I blame?

478
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,470
It's kind of a baseline
requirement of a parent

479
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,570
that their child survive,isn't it?

480
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,700
You have no way of knowing
what she was thinking,

481
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,000
what she was feeling.

482
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,030
That's funny you should mention that

483
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,370
because I just discovered yesterday

484
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,200
that my wife has been working
for some time with a man

485
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,470
who claims he can see the dead.

486
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,300
He can communicate with the dead.

487
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,470
He's a charlatan.

488
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
It enraged me.

489
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,980
And I realized,here I am working

490
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,740
with the genuine article
for almost three years now.

491
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,770
Never once did I tell you about Arianna.

492
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,870
And never once did I ask
if you could reach her.

493
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,540
Not much of a father.

494
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,440
I didn't...

495
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,570
I didn't realize

496
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,940
I was saying anything worth jotting down.

497
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,400
"Last gasp. " Does that
mean anything to you?

498
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,770
"Last gasp?"

499
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,170
What is that?

500
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,470
No.

501
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,570
Doesn't mean a thing to me.

502
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,340
I gotta go.

503
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,670
Don't ask.

504
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,270
Sorry,but I just gotta cut out.

505
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,900
A.J.'s been really patient this week,

506
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,440
but he's officially
reached the saturation point

507
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,100
when it comes to spending
days at this dad's office.

508
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,840
Uh,the good news is Tracy'll
be back in town tomorrow

509
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,370
and I promise I'll be
good for some late nights.

510
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,500
Okay,then.

511
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,380
Joe,you okay?

512
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,370
Yeah,I'm fine.

513
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,600
Don't worry about it. I'll see you tomorrow.

514
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,040
Okay.

515
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,320
That you,darling?

516
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,910
What are you doing out of bed?

517
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,700
I'll be in to give you kisses

518
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,140
and hugs and touches in a bit.

519
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,500
I said back to bed,honey.

520
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,300
Whatever you say,Daddy.

521
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,370
it`s done

522
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,120
I know it sounds bizarre.

523
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,400
That point is not lost on me.

524
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,640
So there's this killer doll...

525
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,040
I didn't say that!

526
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,100
What I'm saying is I saw
another child kill her father.

527
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,370
And it seemed the doll...

528
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,840
seemed to be mastermind.

529
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,270
Even made it look like a
mishap,like the Levitt killing.

530
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,600
The Levitt accident?

531
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,600
The mastermind. Cool.

532
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,300
Any sense of where this may have happened?

533
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,170
I can send some men down to the mall.

534
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,440
We can round up some Kens,some
Barbies,some Cabbage Patches.

535
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,400
One of those little bastards
is bound to know something.

536
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,070
What?

537
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,740
You're not gonna help me,are you?

538
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,740
With what?

539
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,270
Fine. I'll do it myself!

540
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,300
Be careful.

541
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,100
That Raggedy Ann may look out of shape,

542
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,140
but she'll kick your ass in a fight.

543
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,000
Hello.

544
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,540
Ms. Levitt,Allison Dubois

545
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,600
with the District Attorney's office.

546
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,140
We met the morning of the accident.

547
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,300
I just wanted to pay my respects

548
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,800
and see how you and Oliver were doing.

549
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,300
Okay.

550
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,540
Thank you.

551
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,300
Um...

552
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,770
Make yourself at home.

553
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,240
If you'll just excuse me,I
have something I need to do.

554
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,340
Hello,Oliver.

555
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,700
Sorry about your father.

556
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,700
No,you're not.

557
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,240
Who's your friend?

558
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,570
It's not a friend.

559
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,540
It's just a doll.

560
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,070
Really?

561
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,570
Well,when I was young,my
dolls were like friends to me.

562
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,340
I would talk to them.

563
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,440
Tell them things.

564
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,170
Things I couldn't tell anybody else.

565
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,340
Secrets and things.

566
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,740
Do you ever do that?

567
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,400
Maybe.

568
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,370
Sometimes.

569
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,370
So what kind of things do you tell her?

570
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,340
Things about your father?

571
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:45,440
You think it wasn't an accident,don't you?

572
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,240
I don't know.

573
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,060
What do you think?

574
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,430
You can tell me the truth,Oliver.

575
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,500
I really wanna help you.

576
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,440
Oliver.

577
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,840
Your mommy's on the phone,sweetie.

578
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,270
She really wants to talk to you.

579
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,470
Come on.

580
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,640
*

581
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,070
Mom's home!

582
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,770
Pizza,guys! Come and get it.

583
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,140
Come on!

584
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,370
Can I talk to you?

585
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,470
Can I show you something?

586
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,800
No.

587
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,710
There's really nothing to talk about.

588
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,310
I'm visiting my daughter

589
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,040
and you have your work.

590
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,920
What else is there to say?

591
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,570
I'd like to go with you.

592
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,840
I'd like to try to get a
seat on that plane tomorrow.

593
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,250
I just... before we visit
our daughter's grave,I...

594
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:46,370
I'd love you to take a
little road trip with me.

595
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,290
2:20 in the morning.

596
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,100
I tell you. This ought to be illegal.

597
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,970
I got it.

598
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,540
Yeah.

599
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,200
May I please talk to your wife?

600
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,000
It's a kid.

601
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,280
Who is this?

602
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,150
How old are you?

603
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,500
Do you know what time it is?

604
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,920
It's 20 minutes after 2:00.

605
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,040
Will you hand the phone to your wife,please?

606
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,910
No,no,as a matter of fact,I will not.

607
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,900
It's the middle of the
night,and she's in bed,

608
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,750
which is where somebody
your age ought to be.

609
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,660
Now,if you call here again,I'm
contacting your parents.

610
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,480
Trust me: you'll wish you'd never been born.

611
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,300
What did he say?

612
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,770
I don't know.

613
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,340
He said he wanted to talk to you,uh.

614
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,640
Yes?

615
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,670
I really don't have any parents.

616
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,930
And I already wish I'd never been born.

617
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:51,270
So,if you don't mind,may I
please speak with your wife?

618
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,600
Hello?

619
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,850
Do you have my doll?

620
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,030
Oliver,it's the middle of the night.

621
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,650
I couldn't sleep without Maggie.

622
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:12,070
Okay,all right,I'll bring it right over.

623
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,600
You'll bring what right over?

624
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,760
I have to run a quick errand.

625
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,900
At 2:00 in the morning?

626
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,370
Don't you want to know why I took it?

627
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,130
No. I already know why you took it.

628
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,560
Oliver?

629
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,600
Oliver,who's at the door?

630
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,470
What's going on?

631
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,140
Mrs. Levitt,

632
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,300
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you.

633
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,640
I... Somehow your nephew's doll got...

634
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,900
I was playing a game,and
I hid it in her bag,

635
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,980
and I forgot to bring it
back before she left today.

636
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,610
I looked her up in the phone book

637
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,470
and asked her to bring it back to me.

638
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,450
Oh,my God. And she did.

639
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,270
Oliver,it's the middle of the night.

640
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,270
No,no,no,no. Please. It's okay.

641
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,830
Really. You-You two have
been through a lot lately.

642
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,200
Sounded like he really needed the doll.

643
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:10,150
You're a very perceptive person,Mrs...

644
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,460
Dubois.

645
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,330
And if you'll forgive me,

646
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:16,530
Mr. Dubois and the three
little Dubois are at home

647
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,570
waiting for me,so...

648
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,540
Was he excited

649
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,930
when you slid down the chimney with his toy?

650
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,200
Actually,he was waiting for me.

651
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:39,430
Well,then,I guess he was excited.

652
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,530
Oh,maybe,or maybe he has a
little bit of what I have.

653
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,830
Oliver Levitt is psychic.

654
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,000
What do you mean?

655
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,900
Well,I mean,I'm a freak,but
I'm not that big of a freak.

656
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,100
There are other people out there

657
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,100
who feel things,see things.

658
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,730
Especially children.

659
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,670
A lot of people believe.

660
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,300
All children start with it,

661
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,570
and they lose it when they start to...

662
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,200
talk and start to read.

663
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,400
That boy definitely has it.

664
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:17,430
He knew I was at the front
door before I got there.

665
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,070
He knew I didn't think

666
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,130
his father's death was an accident.

667
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,800
He knew I took his doll.

668
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,100
Okay,

669
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,370
but none of that makes him a murderer.

670
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,600
None of that makes his doll evil.

671
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,370
None of that proves

672
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,800
his father didn't actually fall off a ladder

673
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,830
trying to get a cat off a roof.

674
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,630
No fair.

675
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,200
It's the middle of the night.

676
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,370
You can't attack me with logic.

677
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,670
Sorry,baby. I'm tired,

678
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,730
and this is war.

679
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,770
Hmm.

680
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,900
Good night,sweetheart.

681
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:15,500
It happened again.

682
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,070
It happened again. It happened again.

683
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,170
We have to get rid of him.

684
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,700
I can't.

685
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,070
Sure,you can.

686
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,200
No,I can't. I can't do it.

687
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,900
Well,why not?

688
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,270
Because... because he's my father.

689
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,700
He's so much bigger than me.

690
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,800
Sarah Jane,didn't I tell you to go to sleep?

691
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,400
Sarah Jane?

692
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,900
Sarah Jane Levitt.

693
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:50,530
Oliver's aunt- it was her doll.

694
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,610
I think the car is here.

695
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,800
Well,hello.

696
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,240
I seem to have got you at a bad time.

697
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:04,200
We were just getting ready to
go back home to San Francisco.

698
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,520
There's a lot to do.

699
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,950
You know,getting Oliver into school,and...

700
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,770
...starting the formal adoption,

701
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,390
and dealing with his mom.

702
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,440
He's been through so much.

703
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,940
Mm-hmm.

704
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,640
Oh,by the way,thank you again
for returning Oliver's doll.

705
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,100
It meant the world to him.

706
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,050
Oh.

707
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:26,380
I couldn't help but
notice,it's a rather old doll.

708
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:31,610
Well,actually,it belonged to
me when I was a little child.

709
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,700
I used to confide in it,tell it things.

710
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,280
About a year ago,I sensed that
Oliver had a lot on his mind,

711
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,500
and,uh,it made his father angry,

712
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,140
but I thought he might take
some comfort in talking to her,

713
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:48,100
letting her keep his secrets.

714
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,270
I'm sorry. Was there something specific?

715
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,640
Something you need from me?

716
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,300
I just wanted to tell you...

717
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,300
you're going to get away with it.

718
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,200
Nobody senses.

719
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,670
Nobody cares.

720
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,500
I have no idea what you're talking about.

721
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,670
Really? That's funny,'cause
I did a little research,

722
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,070
and it seems

723
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,770
tragic accidents

724
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,090
kind of follow you wherever you go.

725
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,160
First there was your father
falling down the stairs,

726
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,490
now your brother?

727
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:39,970
My father passed almost 35 years ago.

728
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,140
What does any of that
have to do with Michael?

729
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,910
Your father was a very
troubled man,wasn't he?

730
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,430
The social worker

731
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,650
who interviewed you and your brother

732
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,240
shortly after his death

733
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,500
indicated a probable pattern of abuse.

734
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,630
Funny thing about abuse.

735
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:02,270
Oftentimes the victims
become the abusers themselves.

736
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:05,220
Your father was awfully hard on you,

737
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,570
and he tortured the hell
out of Michael,didn't he?

738
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:16,140
So what are you suggesting?

739
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,920
He's gone.

740
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,410
They are both gone.

741
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:24,550
Oliver is safe.

742
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,310
I just want you to know...

743
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,930
it stops here.

744
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,510
I'm going to keep in touch.

745
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,560
Have a safe flight.

746
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,820
I'll call you when you get home.

747
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,570
Bye!

748
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,040
Hey,you!

749
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,070
How you doing? You ready for your big trip?

750
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,240
I just told your aunt that I
want to keep in touch with you.

751
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:00,270
I want you to tell me
all about your new school

752
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,270
and all about your new friends.

753
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,500
Speaking of friends,where's your doll?

754
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,610
I don't know.

755
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,370
I think I lost her.

756
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,000
I'm usually pretty good at finding things,

757
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,480
guessing things,

758
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,770
but all of a sudden,I
can't remember where she is.

759
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,160
Well,she'll turn up if she's meant to.

760
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,470
I don't care.

761
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:23,330
I'm kind of tired of her anyway.

762
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:27,080
Well,sounds like maybe you've outgrown her.

763
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,740
Sounds like maybe

764
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,540
you're outgrowing a lot of things.

765
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,750
Happy travels.

766
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:50,100
*

767
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,800
That sign said we just left town.

768
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,340
Do you have any idea what
it is you're looking for?

769
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,370
Not really,no.

770
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,530
I don't understand.

771
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,330
We're at least 20 minutes from Ithaca,

772
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,500
from the cemetery.

773
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,000
It's after 3:00.

774
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,740
It's going to be dark soon.

775
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,600
Now we're not going to
be able to see her grave

776
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,640
till tomorrow morning.

777
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,790
I should have known better.

778
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,960
I should have come by myself.

779
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,270
Manny,what are you doing?

780
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,220
Manny,where are you going?

781
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:51,440
I'm sorry.

782
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,900
I shouldn't have said that.

783
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,740
Tomorrow is time enough.

784
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,370
I'm just happy you're here with me.

785
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,370
It's all crap,Lily.

786
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,470
Everything they try to tell you about dying-

787
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,770
it's all crap.

788
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,970
They're just trying to sell you coffins

789
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,130
and gravestones and funerals.

790
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,290
The truth is,when you die,you're dead,

791
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,290
and that's that.

792
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,500
There are no messages from the beyond.

793
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,880
There are no souls trying
to reach out to the living.

794
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,330
You're here,and then you're gone,

795
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,020
and that's why it makes
me so mad that she just...

796
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,670
...she just threw it all away.

797
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:51,090
Manuel?

798
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,650
Manny,come here!

799
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,330
Manny,please!

800
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:19,950
Now I know why you brought me here.

801
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,600
Look.

802
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,930
My God.

803
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,380
Zinnias.

804
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,030
White zinnias.

805
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,920
Shh.

806
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,230
But it's the middle of winter.

807
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:38,040
They were always her favorite.

808
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,330
Hello?

809
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,250
Hold on a second.

810
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,000
Honey,we overslept. Oh.

811
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,760
Phone's for you. Someone from work.

812
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,450
Yeah.

813
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,970
Joe Dubois.

814
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,860
Hi,Aaron.

815
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,740
Everything all right?

816
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,620
Oh?

817
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:13,430
Chicken pox?

818
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,290
What? You got it from your kid?

819
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,500
This wouldn't be the same kid

820
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,980
that you were bringing into
work last week,would it?

821
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:28,130
I see. I think I'm gonna
have to get back to you,Aaron.
