1
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:06,698
Daddy, the first time that you saw Mommy


2
00:00:06,698 --> 00:00:08,593
Did you know that she was the one?

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,687
I sure did

4
00:00:10,687 --> 00:00:14,771
I saw your mother cross a crowded room
and the second I looked into her eyes...

5
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:16,604
everything else just fell away.

6
00:00:16,637 --> 00:00:18,960
That was it.
Bang, I was gone.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,246
Wow.

8
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:20,825
Where were you?

9
00:00:20,826 --> 00:00:24,203
Fat Bobby's Sports Bar
and Grill.

10
00:00:24,203 --> 00:00:25,804
That's where all
the magic started.

11
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:32,303
You guys met at a place
called Fat Bobby's?

12
00:00:32,337 --> 00:00:34,570
Mmm, well, we were in college.

13
00:00:34,603 --> 00:00:36,537
ARIEL:
Still...

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,969
Hey, you want to hear
something funny

15
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:40,136
Daddy and I almost met
three years earlier.

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,999
Really?
JOE:
Yeah, that's right.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,800
I was a junior in college

18
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,100
and I had a project on display

19
00:00:46,134 --> 00:00:49,334
at the Mesa University
Science and Engineering Fair.

20
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:51,933
Won third place.

21
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:54,200
Yeah, we didn't put it
together till years later,

22
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:56,234
but I was also at
that science fair.

23
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:57,800
And you guys didn't
see each other?

24
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,200
I guess not.

25
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:02,599
I like to think
I would've remembered.

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,065
Well, that's a
much better story

27
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:05,867
than meeting at a place
called Fat Bobby's.

28
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:07,867
Too bad it didn't
happen that way.

29
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,449
Yeah, then I could be older now.

30
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:11,815
I could be 11.

31
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:20,048
Hey, Ariel, where's your sister?

32
00:01:20,082 --> 00:01:22,449
What are you talking about?
She's right here?

33
00:01:24,482 --> 00:01:27,382
Joe, did you see her
go to her bedroom?
Who?

34
00:01:27,415 --> 00:01:29,549
Our daughter, Joe.

35
00:01:29,582 --> 00:01:31,349
She's right over there.

36
00:01:38,482 --> 00:01:40,915
Ariel, what's going on?
Where are your sisters?

37
00:01:40,948 --> 00:01:43,115
What are you talking about, Mom?

38
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:44,681
What sisters?

39
00:01:44,715 --> 00:01:46,648
Okay, this isn't funny.

40
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:48,982
Will you talk to your
children about...

41
00:01:54,516 --> 00:01:56,282
Oh, my God.

42
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:58,282
What's happening?

43
00:01:59,315 --> 00:02:01,549
What's happening?

44
00:02:01,582 --> 00:02:03,549
<i>WOMAN:
Hey, lazy bones.</i>

45
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:06,149
Wake up! Are you planning
on getting up

46
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:08,149
and dressed at any point today?

47
00:02:08,182 --> 00:02:11,915
Mom?

48
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:14,748
I just had the strangest dream.

49
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:24,781
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com Present</font>

50

51
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:03,784
Allison.He's out catting around.

52
00:03:04,813 --> 00:03:05,749
He'll be back.

53
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,049
You have exactly two minutes

54
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:08,650
to find something to eat
for breakfast.

55
00:03:08,683 --> 00:03:09,815
I'm not hungry.

56
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:11,514
What if he gets
hit by a car?

57
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:13,916
What if he gets lost?

58
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:15,916
I'll buy you a puppy.

59
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:17,849
You ready?
Mm-hmm.

60
00:03:17,882 --> 00:03:20,582
When I get married,
I'm staying married.

61
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:21,749
I'm never getting a divorce.

62
00:03:21,782 --> 00:03:24,149
Ally, cut your
mom some slack.

63
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:26,183
It's not like the
divorce was her idea.

64
00:03:26,216 --> 00:03:29,183
I know. When I get married,
it's going to be forever.

65
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:31,049
Married?

66
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:34,116
How 'bout we get someone to ask
us to the junior prom first?

67
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,482
Which reminds me.
The Mesa University

68
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:40,482
Science and Engineering Fair
is this weekend.

69
00:03:40,515 --> 00:03:42,716
You want to go?
That's so weird.

70
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:44,283
Why, because it's
a science fair?

71
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:46,549
Girls are allowed to want
to go to science fairs.

72
00:03:46,582 --> 00:03:48,450
And I'll let you in
on a little secret.

73
00:03:48,482 --> 00:03:50,716
You know what they have
a lot of at science fairs?

74
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:52,216
Boys.

75
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:55,549
No. I mean that
you're asking me.

76
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:57,450
I had a dream about this.

77
00:03:57,482 --> 00:03:59,016
About the science fair?

78
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:00,816
About us going, but...

79
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,049
it wasn't really about that.

80
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,816
I was married and I was
telling my kids about it.

81
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:08,397
Kids?
Three. All girls.

82
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:09,696
And I was telling them

83
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:11,196
about how I almost
met their dad

84
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,095
at this science fair.

85
00:04:12,096 --> 00:04:14,699
There's a dad? A husband?

86
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,234
Ally, you are such a tramp.

87
00:04:17,268 --> 00:04:19,268
No.

88
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,501
He was really kind
of cute for an old guy.

89
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:23,567
He had really great hair.

90
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,934
Well, that's nice.

91
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:26,834
Look, I hate to
burst your bubble,

92
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,068
but scientifically speaking...

93
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:32,001
Dreams are just random firing
of neurons in your brain.

94
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:33,334
They don't mean anything.

95
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:35,301
They certainly can't
predict the future.

96
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:36,934
What are you trying to say?

97
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:39,068
I'm trying to say, I don't
think you're actually

98
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:40,700
going to meet
Mr. Fabulous Hair

99
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:42,468
at the science fair
this weekend.

100
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:46,277
Still want to go? Say yes.

101
00:04:46,277 --> 00:04:47,543
Yes.

102
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:48,744
Later, 'gator.

103
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:50,843
While, 'dile.

104
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,010
<i>JOE:
Milk.</i>

105
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:58,510
Pink or brown?

106
00:04:58,543 --> 00:05:00,277
Both. Okay.

107
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,644
Fruit wraps...
(carts crashing)

108
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,776
I'm so sorry. I...

109
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:06,210
That's okay. No harm, no...

110
00:05:06,243 --> 00:05:08,310
Ally?

111
00:05:08,343 --> 00:05:10,477
Allison Rolen?

112
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,243
Is that you?
I can't believe it!

113
00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:13,943
Hey.
Stephen!

114
00:05:14,976 --> 00:05:16,577
Hey! When did you
get into town?

115
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,043
I heard you were
living in New York.

116
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:20,110
I was. I... New York,

117
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:22,343
Fort Lauderdale,
Lititz, Pennsylvania.

118
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:24,410
You move around a lot
in my line of work.

119
00:05:24,443 --> 00:05:27,010
You know, I don't even know
what it is you do.

120
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:29,610
Have I even seen you
since high school?

121
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:31,377
Are you married?
Do you have kids?

122
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,043
No wife. No kids. No dogs.
(chuckles)

123
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:36,343
Did I mention I move around
a lot in my line of work?

124
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,543
Marketing. Telecommunications.
Cellular phones.

125
00:05:39,577 --> 00:05:42,143
You must do very well.
Everyone I know has one.

126
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,909
Hi. How're you doing?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

127
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:47,043
Stephen Campbell,
this is Joe Dubois,
Hi.

128
00:05:47,076 --> 00:05:48,677
my husband. Engineer.

129
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,010
Hello.
Wife. Three kids.

130
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:52,976
High school.
Next-door neighbor.

131
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,909
Comic book freak.
You still?

132
00:05:54,943 --> 00:05:56,110
Still.

133
00:05:57,644 --> 00:05:59,243
Oh, hey, let me
give you my number.

134
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:00,943
Let's get together and
have lunch or something.

135
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:02,477
That sounds great.

136
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,343
And, uh... how's Izzy?

137
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:05,677
You're still close?

138
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,477
No, we sort of
lost touch.

139
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,677
She went to Harvard
and I went to Mesa.

140
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:13,143
So I'll call you?

141
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:14,943
Yeah, you better.

142
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:16,809
Good to meet you.

143
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,876
Yes. So long.

144
00:06:22,076 --> 00:06:23,377
Hmm, so what are we talking?

145
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,143
Friend? Boyfriend?
Unrequited love?

146
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:27,943
Hmm...
All of the above?

147
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:29,210
Crush. I think.

148
00:06:29,243 --> 00:06:31,377
Him on me. Junior year
of high school.

149
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,043
Aah.
He was pretty shy back then.

150
00:06:34,076 --> 00:06:36,976
Oh, that was not a shy hug
that he gave you.

151
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,210
Well, I guess he's not
as shy as he used to be.

152
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:45,631
Hello?

153
00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:47,798
An hour.

154
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,065
Yeah, sure.

155
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,210
Okay, bye.

156
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,275
Why do I get the feeling

157
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:58,910
that I'm gonna be unpacking
all these groceries

158
00:06:58,943 --> 00:07:01,443
by myself? Huh? Huh?

159
00:07:04,943 --> 00:07:07,410
Looks like she was raped
and then strangled to death.

160
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:09,010
And here's the weird part.

161
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:10,643
After she was dead,
we think the killer

162
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:12,710
took the time to redress her
and wash her face

163
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:15,077
and wrap her up
before he dumped her.

164
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,137
Tow truck driver
working in the area

165
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:18,405
saw a white sedan

166
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,905
stopped on the shoulder
sometime after midnight.

167
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:22,438
Afraid that's about
the closest thing

168
00:07:22,472 --> 00:07:24,938
we have to a real clue.

169
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:27,539
Her name's Nancy Claymore.

170
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,572
Her parents reported her

171
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:31,105
missing two days ago.

172
00:07:31,138 --> 00:07:34,038
Oh, my God. How old is she?

173
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:36,871
She just turned 13.

174
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:45,138
<i>YOUNG ALLISON:
Have you ever seen
a dead person?</i>

175
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:48,172
Oh, my God. You found
a funny cigarette

176
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:50,572
in your mom's purse
again, didn't you?

177
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,205
I had another dream last night.

178
00:07:54,238 --> 00:07:56,539
Like the last one.
Set in the future?

179
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:58,804
I explained
this to you.

180
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:02,238
I just... it felt so real.

181
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:04,338
I mean, it was so specific.
No, it wasn't.

182
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:07,071
It just seemed that way.

183
00:08:07,105 --> 00:08:08,905
You were in it.

184
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:11,905
I mean...
we had lost touch.

185
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:12,905
We weren't friends anymore.

186
00:08:12,938 --> 00:08:14,838
Well, see, that's
what I mean.

187
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:16,838
That's never gonna happen.

188
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,205
I was, like, a cop
or something.

189
00:08:19,238 --> 00:08:22,338
Oh, future cop. Cool.

190
00:08:22,372 --> 00:08:24,671
There was this girl.

191
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,771
Nancy Claymore.

192
00:08:26,804 --> 00:08:28,938
She was 13 and she
had been murdered.

193
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:31,605
Allison.

194
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:34,272
Come on.
Future cop?

195
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,871
Future dream?

196
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:38,472
You really think
any of this is gonna happen?

197
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:40,671
I don't know.

198
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:42,771
When I dream it...

199
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:44,871
it all seems so plausible.

200
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:46,372
You know?

201
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:48,539
There's nothing about it
that couldn't happen.

202
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:53,038
Although...

203
00:08:53,071 --> 00:08:55,305
Actually, in the dream...

204
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:57,639
I did run in this guy.

205
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,038
His name was Stephen,

206
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,405
and I think he was supposed
to be an old friend.

207
00:09:02,905 --> 00:09:04,572
From high school.

208
00:09:04,605 --> 00:09:07,238
I don't know no
stinkin' Stephen.

209
00:09:07,272 --> 00:09:09,038
<i>And I don't know
no stinkin' Stephen.</i>

210
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:12,138
Ah, praise the Lord.
Hallelujah!

211
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:14,871
The girl was blind,
now can see!

212
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:20,372
Looks like you're
getting a new neighbor.

213
00:09:24,771 --> 00:09:26,338
YOUNG ALLISON:
Hi.

214
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:28,738
What's going on?
Somebody new moving in?

215
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:31,605
Uh... just me and my dad.

216
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:35,738
I'm, uh, I'm Stephen.

217
00:09:35,995 --> 00:09:36,995
Stephen Campbell

218
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:45,379
...and we've got
the mountains.

219
00:09:45,612 --> 00:09:47,679
And the deserts,
obviously.

220
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:50,712
A lot of seniors,

221
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:54,912
after they get their license,
will, like, rent a dune buggy

222
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:58,812
and just spend the day up there
getting trashed.

223
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:03,912
Well, what, uh...
what about comic book stores?

224
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:06,278
You guys have,
you guys have comic book stores?

225
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:08,679
In Chicago,
they're...

226
00:10:08,712 --> 00:10:11,445
they're all over the place.

227
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:13,046
You read comic books?

228
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:17,579
Uh... I collect
graphic novels, yes.

229
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:20,912
What? Come on,
have you ever seen one?

230
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:22,579
I mean, come on,
you have, you have,

231
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:24,345
<i>you have Watchmen,
you have Secret Wars,</i>

232
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:26,779
<i>you have The Dark Knight.</i>

233
00:10:26,812 --> 00:10:29,946
<i>(laughing)
You got to know... you got
to know The Dark Knight.</i>

234
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:31,445
Come on.

235
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:33,879
No, the guy, this guy... ah...

236
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:35,553
the guy who does them,
Frank Miller,

237
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:37,854
he's just-- he's this,
he's this genius.

238
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,854
IZZY:
Genius?

239
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:40,653
Like Isaac Newton?

240
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:42,287
Like Galileo?

241
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:44,221
I'm talking about
a living genius.

242
00:10:44,254 --> 00:10:45,753
Okay, I'm talking about someone

243
00:10:45,787 --> 00:10:47,187
who makes a difference
in my life,

244
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:49,653
not some guy who just had
an apple fall on his head

245
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:51,154
like a million years ago.

246
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:53,386
Oh, don't mind her.

247
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,321
If you say he's a genius,
I'm sure he's a genius.

248
00:10:58,154 --> 00:11:00,587
(whispers):
Thank you.

249
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,287
But, you know, you don't have
to take my word for it.

250
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:05,787
Saturday, there's a, uh,

251
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,954
comic book convention
at the Civic Center.

252
00:11:07,987 --> 00:11:10,453
This Saturday,
that's the science fair.

253
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:17,187
At the college?

254
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,087
I mean, that was the plan.

255
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,221
You know, why don't you just...

256
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:23,653
why don't you just think
about that?

257
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:24,954
Yeah, we will.

258
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:34,920
What goes in here?

259
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:37,187
Oh, um...

260
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:41,287
that is my...
dad's collection.

261
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:43,020
Collection of what?

262
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:50,321
No, it's okay.

263
00:11:50,353 --> 00:11:54,120
It's, it's...
it's not loaded.

264
00:11:54,154 --> 00:11:55,453
<i>ALLISON:
Pablo.</i>

265
00:11:55,486 --> 00:11:57,486
Here, kitty.
(dog barks in distance)

266
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,987
DIANE: Did that cat
run off again?

267
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,987
He'll be back.

268
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,987
Were you at the Campbells again?

269
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,120
Izzy and I were just hanging out
with Stephen.

270
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:12,987
He's nice.

271
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,154
You're not over there
drinking or anything?

272
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:17,020
No, Mom, nothing.

273
00:12:17,054 --> 00:12:19,386
I don't even think they
have liquor in their house.

274
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,887
I think Mr. Campbell
is kind of... strict.

275
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,553
Well, what about
Mrs. Campbell?

276
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:26,787
They moved in a week ago.

277
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,787
I still haven't caught
a glimpse of her.

278
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,353
Oh, there is no
Mrs. Campbell.

279
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:32,020
I mean, I think
they're divorced.

280
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:34,854
Really?

281
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,054
So he's raising
that boy all alone.

282
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:38,587
Mom.

283
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,020
I don't think
it's a good idea

284
00:12:40,054 --> 00:12:42,154
for you to get involved
with Mr. Campbell.

285
00:12:42,187 --> 00:12:45,254
Who said anything
about getting involved?

286
00:12:45,287 --> 00:12:47,620
There's nothing wrong
with baking them

287
00:12:47,653 --> 00:12:48,987
a batch of cookies,
is there?

288
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,553
To say "Welcome
to the neighborhood."

289
00:12:51,587 --> 00:12:53,720
I'm going to sleep.

290
00:12:53,753 --> 00:12:56,254
<i>DEVALOS:
I appreciate everyone
coming together this afternoon.</i>

291
00:12:56,287 --> 00:12:59,820
I know that since we've formed
this Nancy Claymore Task Force,

292
00:12:59,854 --> 00:13:03,620
we've all been taking a lot
of criticism in the press,

293
00:13:03,653 --> 00:13:05,887
and while there
haven't been any major
breakthroughs in the case,

294
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,120
there is some new information
we wanted to share.

295
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,221
Lee?

296
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:12,087
Um, the police psychiatrist
is saying

297
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,187
this is probably the first time
the perpetrator killed.

298
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:18,120
According to him, the
murder scene and the methodology

299
00:13:18,154 --> 00:13:21,287
are riddled with wt they call
"indicators of remorse."

300
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:23,154
Taking the time
to re-dress the victim,

301
00:13:23,187 --> 00:13:24,787
wash her, wrap her
in a blanket.

302
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,420
They feel all of these
things are indications

303
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:28,453
that the killer felt
badly about what he did.

304
00:13:28,486 --> 00:13:30,687
Not badly enough, unfortunately,

305
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,620
to pick up the phone
and turn himself in.

306
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:34,386
DEVALOS:
The doctors feel

307
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,787
that while he's never killed,
he'll probably have

308
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,486
a long record of inappropriate
conduct with minor girls.

309
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,620
That's why we've supplied each
of you with a complete file

310
00:13:43,653 --> 00:13:45,054
of all the registered
sex offenders

311
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,854
here in the Phoenix metro area.

312
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:48,453
Study the sheets.

313
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:49,987
Feel free to conduct
any interviews

314
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,386
if you feel there is cause.

315
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,820
And what a wonderful
coincidence.

316
00:13:54,854 --> 00:13:58,386
Here come the latest sheets.

317
00:13:58,387 --> 00:13:59,587
Add these to
your binders.

318
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,020
These would be for
anyone who's relocated

319
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:02,754
to our jurisdiction in
the last four weeks,

320
00:14:02,787 --> 00:14:04,921
and as ordered by the courts,

321
00:14:04,953 --> 00:14:07,554
have registered their
whereabouts with the police.

322
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:13,104
Oh, my God.

323
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:14,670
You know this man?

324
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:18,304
I knew him... in high school.

325
00:14:18,338 --> 00:14:21,704
Suddenly last week,
there he was in the supermarket.

326
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:25,603
Says here he raped a
14-year-old girl
back in Pennsylvania.

327
00:14:25,637 --> 00:14:27,704
You've got
some interesting friends.

328
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,104
<i>STEPHEN:
Hey, Allison.</i>

329
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,603
Wake up.

330
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:36,137
Allison.
(dog barking)

331
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:43,004
I've got a surprise for you.

332
00:14:45,004 --> 00:14:46,438
What are you doing here?

333
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,603
It's the middl
of the night.

334
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,704
Yeah, I couldn't sleep,

335
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:54,669
and I saw this little guy
sneaking through my backyard,

336
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,804
so I chased him down.

337
00:14:56,927 --> 00:15:00,294
I know how worried you get
when he's out all night.

338
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,567
thanks for bringing him home.

339
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:16,567
Yeah, no problem.

340
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:26,567
you should, um...

341
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:28,534
you should
probably get going.

342
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:32,100
Yeah, I don't want my dad
to figure out I'm gone.

343
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,201
But I'll, I'll
see you tomorrow?

344
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:38,001
Yeah.

345
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:05,075
What's the matter,
Future Cop?

346
00:16:05,108 --> 00:16:07,509
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

347
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:09,875
Don't make fun.

348
00:16:09,908 --> 00:16:11,042
I had another dream.

349
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:12,375
Oh, boy.

350
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:15,042
Just give me
your opinion.

351
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,108
What if I saw something,

352
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,776
dreamt something
about a person?

353
00:16:18,808 --> 00:16:21,509
Something horrible, something
that they were going to do

354
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:23,509
in the future.

355
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:26,709
Even if I couldn't prove it,
shouldn't I tell somebody?

356
00:16:26,742 --> 00:16:29,075
Shouldn't I try
and stop it?

357
00:16:29,108 --> 00:16:32,975
Um, in my opinion, no.

358
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:34,108
No?

359
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:38,008
No, people will
think you're nuts.

360
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:40,875
I'm your best friend,
and I think you're nuts.

361
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:44,509
But I'm talking
about something--

362
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:46,309
it's so awful,
it's so evil...

363
00:16:46,342 --> 00:16:47,442
Hey.

364
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:49,709
You want to know what
I really believe?

365
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,642
You don't like the
way the future looks?

366
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,108
Change it.

367
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:57,208
It hasn't happened yet;
it's subject to alteration.

368
00:16:57,242 --> 00:17:00,642
You believe someone's going
to do something awful.

369
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:04,075
Then don't let them.

370
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:05,776
For that matter,

371
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:09,975
if you believe we're going
to stop being friends,

372
00:17:10,008 --> 00:17:11,042
don't allow it.

373
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:17,208
The next time someone wants
to do something with you,

374
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:19,075
and you already
have plans with me,

375
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:21,609
don't tell them that
you'll think about it.

376
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,142
That's my future.

377
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:25,676
I've got to go.
Well, Izzy...

378
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:27,108
I got class.

379
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:40,142
Hey. So, uh,
what have you decided?

380
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:45,975
About Saturday,
the, uh, comic show?

381
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:48,609
Yeah, I know.
I, I just... I can't.

382
00:17:48,642 --> 00:17:50,841
Wh-why?

383
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,742
Because I can't.

384
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:55,175
I mean, I don't
want to.

385
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,941
I'm going to the Science
Fair with Izzy.

386
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,108
I told her I would,

387
00:17:58,142 --> 00:18:00,908
and she's my best friend
and she's counting on it.

388
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:05,475
All right.

389
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:07,042
Okay, well, then maybe
we can, uh,

390
00:18:07,075 --> 00:18:09,308
maybe we can do something
Sunday.

391
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:10,942
I don't think so.

392
00:18:10,975 --> 00:18:12,741
I mean, I'm
kinda feeling that

393
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:15,509
maybe it would just
be better if...

394
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:17,008
I don't know.

395
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:19,442
Well, why?

396
00:18:19,476 --> 00:18:20,708
What, what...

397
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:22,808
have I done something wrong?

398
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:25,641
No, it's just... it's me.

399
00:18:25,675 --> 00:18:27,008
I'm going through something.

400
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:28,746
Trying to figure something out.

401
00:18:28,747 --> 00:18:30,613
Maybe, maybe I can help.

402
00:18:30,647 --> 00:18:33,047
I don't think so.

403
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,513
Not right now.

404
00:18:35,546 --> 00:18:39,647
You sure I haven't, I haven't
done anything...

405
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,446
to make you, make you mad at me?

406
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,880
No, you didn't do anything.

407
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:45,613
I'm not mad at you.

408
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:48,480
Yeah.

409
00:18:48,513 --> 00:18:50,999
Right, I mean, how,
how could you be?

410
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,801
All I did was bring back
your cat, right?

411
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,833
I really do appreciate that.

412
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,167
Yeah, sure you do.

413
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,167
Really, I'm sorry. It's...

414
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,300
really, it's me.

415
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,567
Yeah, sure it is.

416
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,734
<i>SCANLON:
It's right this way,
Mr. Campbell.</i>

417
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,233
This should only take
a few moments.

418
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:14,467
Whatever you say.

419
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:17,700
I'm just, I'm completely baffled
as to why...

420
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:20,300
Stephen, it's nice
to see you again.

421
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:21,700
Allison.

422
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:22,733
I didn't get

423
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:23,766
a chance to tell you

424
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,067
I work for the District
Attorney's office.

425
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,067
I asked the detective

426
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,367
to contact you.

427
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,766
I was hoping you
could help us with

428
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,967
the Nancy Claymore case.

429
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,434
I'm sorry. Who?

430
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:35,800
SCANLON:
A 13-year-old girl.

431
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,601
She was kidnapped
and murdered last week.

432
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:39,766
We're conducting
preliminary interviews

433
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,733
with several persons
of interest

434
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:45,234
based on their histories
of sexual assault on minors.

435
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,933
Stephen, please, have a seat.

436
00:19:57,601 --> 00:19:59,933
SCANLON:
Two years ago you
pleaded no contest

437
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:02,501
to a charge of sexual battery
on a 14-year-old girl.

438
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:07,267
Yes. I made an error
in judgment.

439
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,833
You want to tell us about that?

440
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:12,000
She told me she was 20,
and I believed her.

441
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:14,100
According to her deposition,
she asked you several

442
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:15,300
times to stop.

443
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:17,467
It looks like
the charges were
reduced from rape

444
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:19,467
to battery to avoid a trial.

445
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:21,967
Because they couldn't prove
their case,

446
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,666
because there was no case.

447
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,000
It was all lies.

448
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:30,501
When her parents found out
about us, they got angry at her,

449
00:20:30,534 --> 00:20:32,933
so she lied to them
about what happened.

450
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:35,567
She lied to them
the way she lied to me,

451
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,499
and now because of her lies,

452
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,134
I'm considered a predator
in the eyes of the law.

453
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,100
So what do you want to know,

454
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:49,267
Detective?

455
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:51,034
Allison,

456
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:53,100
how can I convince you
of my innocence?

457
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:56,366
SCANLON:
You can tell me

458
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,067
where you were on the
afternoon of the 15th.

459
00:20:59,715 --> 00:21:01,467
I... I was at home.

460
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:03,267
Can anyone else
confirm that?

461
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,667
No, I don't think so.

462
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,100
What color car do you drive?

463
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:10,801
White.

464
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:14,099
Would you be willing
to provide us

465
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,399
with a sample of your DNA,

466
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,067
or are you gonna make me, uh,
fetch it from Pennsylvania?

467
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,067
Uh, I have nothing to hide.

468
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,767
Okay.

469
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:32,700
You'll understand, right,

470
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:35,767
when I don't call you about
getting together for lunch?

471
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:02,633
Pablo,

472
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,934
is that you?

473
00:22:07,767 --> 00:22:09,934
Here, kitty.

474
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,400
Here, boy.

475
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:42,996
I know you're upset.

476
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,795
Sometimes

477
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,295
in nature these things happen.

478
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:48,362
A bigger animal
comes along and...

479
00:22:48,362 --> 00:22:49,629
Mom,

480
00:22:49,663 --> 00:22:53,096
I don't think
an animal killed Pablo.

481
00:22:54,696 --> 00:22:56,663
I think...

482
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,929
I think maybe
the Campbell boy did it.

483
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:03,830
Oh, I know you're upset.
Allison...

484
00:23:03,863 --> 00:23:05,897
He was mad at me.

485
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:07,929
He likes me, and...

486
00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:10,563
and I've kind of
been avoiding him.

487
00:23:10,596 --> 00:23:13,196
So you think he killed your cat?

488
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:14,879
Allison.

489
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,880
And that's not the only thing.

490
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,747
I've been having dreams again.

491
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,280
You know this is crazy talk,

492
00:23:24,313 --> 00:23:26,446
and you know it upsets me,

493
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,613
and it has nothing to do

494
00:23:28,647 --> 00:23:31,812
with the cat being torn apart
by a dog or a coyote...

495
00:23:31,813 --> 00:23:33,813
Mom, I'm trying to tell you.

496
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,447
I've had dreams about him

497
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,046
in the future,

498
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,013
doing horrible things to girls.

499
00:23:40,046 --> 00:23:42,513
Girls younger than me.

500
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:46,013
Well, I-I... I got
to tell you something.

501
00:23:46,046 --> 00:23:48,779
That says a lot more about you
than it does him.

502
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:52,347
Why would you dream

503
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,247
about anyone doing anything
to young girls?

504
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:00,347
Well, you know who
I blame for this?

505
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,380
Mom, we're not talking
about Grandma now.

506
00:24:02,413 --> 00:24:06,325
For filling your head full
of this nonsense about dreams,

507
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:07,658
about the future.

508
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:09,993
It was bad enough
I had to endure it

509
00:24:10,026 --> 00:24:12,225
growing up when I
was under her roof.

510
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:14,159
But now?
Mom...

511
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:16,993
You grandmother does not know
the future.

512
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:19,326
She does not have visions
or dreams.

513
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,092
She's crazy.

514
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,726
Mom, what are you doing?

515
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:24,225
I need you to listen.

516
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:25,826
You're upset.
Please.

517
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:27,159
I just want you to take one

518
00:24:27,192 --> 00:24:28,526
of these pills
and get some sleep.

519
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,092
Mom, I need you
to listen to me!

520
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,693
No. I won't listen.

521
00:24:32,726 --> 00:24:35,001
Not when you're
talking crazy.

522
00:24:35,002 --> 00:24:38,036
I don't want to listen
to anything about dreams,

523
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:41,703
about special feelings, about

524
00:24:41,736 --> 00:24:44,569
predictions.

525
00:24:44,603 --> 00:24:47,102
Are you gonna take one
of these or not?

526
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,736
IZZY:
Hey.

527
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:07,670
I'm so sorry about Pablo.

528
00:25:08,969 --> 00:25:10,969
Your mom told me.

529
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,935
It's really awful.

530
00:25:17,503 --> 00:25:19,869
Anyway, I want you to know,

531
00:25:19,902 --> 00:25:21,202
I totally understand

532
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:23,603
if you don't want
to come with me today.

533
00:25:25,036 --> 00:25:26,670
What are you
talking about?

534
00:25:26,703 --> 00:25:29,236
To the science fair.

535
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:31,369
Oh.

536
00:25:31,403 --> 00:25:32,770
Right.

537
00:25:32,802 --> 00:25:35,136
I mean, I...
I know you're upset.

538
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:37,136
I know you're depressed, so...

539
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,202
relax.

540
00:25:39,236 --> 00:25:41,069
We don't have to go.

541
00:25:41,102 --> 00:25:43,069
We can just stay here.

542
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,436
Besides, we don't
want to risk

543
00:25:49,469 --> 00:25:53,136
running into
your future husband accidentally

544
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:55,269
and messing up everything

545
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,403
that's supposed
to happen in the future,

546
00:25:57,436 --> 00:26:01,536
and completely screwing up
the balance of nature,

547
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:04,169
and changing the course

548
00:26:04,202 --> 00:26:06,236
of human development

549
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:08,269
on the planet Earth.

550
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,835
Actually...

551
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:14,503
I think I
want to go.

552
00:26:14,536 --> 00:26:16,169
<i>IZZY:
Okay.</i>

553
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:17,770
I'm totally confused.

554
00:26:17,802 --> 00:26:19,336
Now we're looking
for Mr. Goodhair?

555
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,835
Yeah.

556
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:22,403
Don't you see?

557
00:26:22,436 --> 00:26:24,503
He's part of the future
I've been dreaming.

558
00:26:24,536 --> 00:26:26,869
In my dreams, I don't
meet him until college,

559
00:26:26,902 --> 00:26:28,736
unless right
now, right here,

560
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,835
I make it a point
to meet him.

561
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:32,770
(camera shutter clicking)
I change
the future.

562
00:26:34,272 --> 00:26:36,930
And then maybe,
just... just maybe,

563
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,396
all the bad things
I've been dreaming
about won't happen.

564
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,797
Allison?

565
00:26:40,831 --> 00:26:43,797
You are in dire need
of psychological help,

566
00:26:43,831 --> 00:26:46,497
or, I don't know, a...

567
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,597
conk on the noggin
with a big hammer or something.

568
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,464
You're not gonna meet
this Joe guy today.

569
00:26:52,497 --> 00:26:54,964
He's not in here.

570
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:57,697
He's in there.

571
00:26:57,731 --> 00:26:59,164
He doesn't exist.

572
00:26:59,198 --> 00:27:01,330
Well, we'll just
see, won't we?

573
00:27:01,363 --> 00:27:02,864
(laughing):
Oh!

574
00:27:07,697 --> 00:27:09,664
Come here for a second.

575
00:27:10,931 --> 00:27:12,697
How would you
pronounce that name?

576
00:27:14,831 --> 00:27:17,230
Joseph Duboys?

577
00:27:17,264 --> 00:27:19,430
Yoseph Dew-bwa?

578
00:27:19,464 --> 00:27:21,297
I think
this is it.

579
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,297
I think this is his.

580
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,931
Looks like the future's safe.

581
00:27:24,964 --> 00:27:26,297
Did you see that?

582
00:27:30,797 --> 00:27:32,764
What are you guys
looking at?

583
00:27:32,797 --> 00:27:34,197
Hey.

584
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,664
You know, I've been looking
for you two everywhere.

585
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,297
What are you doing here?

586
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,297
I don't know.

587
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:44,297
Um, it was kind of a...
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

588
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,664
You know, I knew
this was where

589
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:48,596
you really wanted to be,
so I thought,

590
00:27:48,597 --> 00:27:50,462
if Allison wants to go
to the science fair,

591
00:27:50,463 --> 00:27:54,085
then, you know, the hell
with the comic book convention.

592
00:27:57,366 --> 00:27:59,232
That's so sweet.

593
00:28:00,532 --> 00:28:03,005
So, you guys want
to grab some lunch after?

594
00:28:03,006 --> 00:28:04,972
I'm, uh...

595
00:28:05,006 --> 00:28:06,273
I'm buying.

596
00:28:06,306 --> 00:28:09,606
No. I just... I really
want to go home after.

597
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,849
Oh.

598
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,850
I guess, um,

599
00:28:12,882 --> 00:28:14,516
you didn't hear.

600
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:16,683
Pablo was killed last night.

601
00:28:16,716 --> 00:28:18,716
In her yard.

602
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,549
Like, a dog

603
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,383
or something.

604
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:26,649
Oh, that's terrible.

605
00:28:27,783 --> 00:28:28,949
That's terrible.

606
00:28:28,982 --> 00:28:31,349
Allison, I am so sorry.

607
00:28:33,116 --> 00:28:34,583
This is really awful. Allison...

608
00:28:34,616 --> 00:28:36,383
IZZY:
Allison,

609
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:37,449
what are you doing?

610
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,450
It's okay.
She's just...

611
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,649
She's-She's upset.

612
00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:44,085
You stay away from me.

613
00:28:44,086 --> 00:28:45,752
I know all about you.

614
00:28:45,786 --> 00:28:47,420
I know who you are.

615
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:48,251
IZZY:
Allison,

616
00:28:48,252 --> 00:28:50,319
what's wrong with you?
Nothing.
She's upset.

617
00:28:50,352 --> 00:28:53,020
That's all. She just doesn't
know what she's talking about.

618
00:28:53,053 --> 00:28:54,085
I have to go.

619
00:28:54,086 --> 00:28:55,086
I have to go home.

620
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:59,678
I need to be by
myself for a while.

621
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,012
<i>SCANLON:
Do you know why you're here?</i>

622
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:03,045
Because

623
00:29:03,046 --> 00:29:05,071
there's been a screw-up
somewhere.

624
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:06,804
Because somebody,
someplace has made a mistake.

625
00:29:06,837 --> 00:29:08,304
SCANLON:
Well, should
that turn out

626
00:29:08,337 --> 00:29:09,636
to be the case,
then you're absolutely

627
00:29:09,637 --> 00:29:11,303
within your rights
to file a complaint

628
00:29:11,337 --> 00:29:12,504
th the proper authorities.

629
00:29:12,537 --> 00:29:14,236
But I suspect
you'll be a little busy

630
00:29:14,237 --> 00:29:16,437
finding yourself
a good defense attorney.

631
00:29:18,652 --> 00:29:19,651
What's this?

632
00:29:19,652 --> 00:29:20,718
Who are these people?

633
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,051
ALLISON:
These are
the faces

634
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,353
of the seven
young girls

635
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,885
that you raped but
chose not to kill.

636
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,519
The seven that
we know about.

637
00:29:27,553 --> 00:29:29,152
The seven that
we can prove.

638
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:33,000
You believe this?

639
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:34,999
You believe
that I raped all these girls?

640
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I believe in
science, Stephen,

641
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:38,968
and the science
says you did it.

642
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,100
SCANLON:
Not only were we able
to make a DNA match,

643
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:43,766
but no matter what part
of the country

644
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:45,267
these abductions
and rapes occurred in,

645
00:29:45,301 --> 00:29:48,260
it coincided with your arrival
and departure from that region.

646
00:29:48,261 --> 00:29:49,460
ALLISON:
It's just a
matter of time.

647
00:29:49,461 --> 00:29:50,627
We're faxing
your photograph

648
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,470
to the local police
in each jurisdiction.

649
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:56,827
These girls will
identify you.

650
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,912
They will testify.

651
00:29:58,913 --> 00:30:00,879
But that's the least
of your problems,

652
00:30:00,913 --> 00:30:01,877
because we're charging you

653
00:30:01,878 --> 00:30:03,912
with the murder
of Nancy Claymore.

654
00:30:06,646 --> 00:30:08,613
I see.

655
00:30:08,646 --> 00:30:10,679
And...

656
00:30:10,713 --> 00:30:12,745
what is it you want from me?

657
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,878
A confession
would be nice.

658
00:30:14,912 --> 00:30:17,512
It would save
us the effort

659
00:30:17,546 --> 00:30:20,679
and the expense
involved in a trial.

660
00:30:20,713 --> 00:30:23,412
I am authorized
to offer you

661
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:27,512
life without the
possibility of parole.

662
00:30:27,546 --> 00:30:30,312
My goodness.

663
00:30:30,346 --> 00:30:33,379
Your mom must be awfully
proud of you.

664
00:30:33,412 --> 00:30:36,279
I'm trying to help you
avoid the death penalty.

665
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:38,379
Again?

666
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:43,812
Do you remember...

667
00:30:43,845 --> 00:30:47,812
the day your Mom had you bring
some cookies over to my house?

668
00:30:49,713 --> 00:30:51,845
Of course you don't.

669
00:30:51,878 --> 00:30:54,912
It wasn't a particularly
important day for you.

670
00:30:54,945 --> 00:30:57,479
All you did was walk over

671
00:30:57,512 --> 00:31:00,246
to the new neighbors' house
and knock on the front door.

672
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,523
Okay...

673
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:05,321
But, see,
what you didn't know

674
00:31:05,354 --> 00:31:09,087
was that right before you
knocked on that door...

675
00:31:09,088 --> 00:31:11,287
I had a gun in my mouth.

676
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,654
And I was determined
to kill myself.

677
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:17,053
I remember it so clearly.

678
00:31:17,054 --> 00:31:18,387
Across the street..

679
00:31:18,421 --> 00:31:22,187
the McElroys were getting ready
for their family reunion.

680
00:31:22,221 --> 00:31:26,321
And down the block,
some guy was washing his car

681
00:31:26,354 --> 00:31:30,187
and he had his car radio
blasting "Sister Christian."

682
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,387
My dad had just kicked
the crap out of me for

683
00:31:33,421 --> 00:31:36,721
leaving a jar of jelly
out on the counter overnight.

684
00:31:36,754 --> 00:31:39,387
So I sat down
on the couch.

685
00:31:39,421 --> 00:31:44,287
I put one of his precious
antique revolvers in my mouth,

686
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:46,120
and then...

687
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,521
there was a knock on the door.

688
00:31:50,888 --> 00:31:55,154
And who did I find standing
on my doorstep...

689
00:31:55,187 --> 00:31:58,888
but the girl next door...

690
00:31:58,921 --> 00:32:01,421
Allison Rolen.

691
00:32:01,454 --> 00:32:02,987
My secret crush.

692
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,454
And wonder of wonders
we talked,

693
00:32:07,488 --> 00:32:08,821
and...

694
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:12,688
started thinking that maybe
she likes me.

695
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:16,020
And maybe life is worth
living after all.

696
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:20,821
I need a confession, Stephen.

697
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,554
Are you prepared to do that?

698
00:32:22,588 --> 00:32:25,588
Do I call a stenographer?

699
00:32:25,621 --> 00:32:28,955
Or do I call my boss and tell
him that we are having a trial?

700
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:35,888
You hear that knock?

701
00:32:37,554 --> 00:32:39,354
Isn't she something?

702
00:32:39,387 --> 00:32:42,321
She's going to save
my life again.

703
00:32:59,987 --> 00:33:03,387
Hey. What's going on?

704
00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:09,287
What did he do to you?

705
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,421
I don't know... he just...

706
00:33:12,454 --> 00:33:15,621
one minute we were
just talking, and then...

707
00:33:15,654 --> 00:33:18,493
he tried to kiss me...

708
00:33:18,493 --> 00:33:20,625
and then he was...

709
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:22,926
on top of me and...

710
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,793
I said, "No," and then...

711
00:33:25,826 --> 00:33:27,826
he got really angry.

712
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:31,659
Izzy, did he hurt you?
No.

713
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:35,459
No. We heard
his dad come home.

714
00:33:35,492 --> 00:33:38,893
And then he let go of me,

715
00:33:38,926 --> 00:33:42,592
and I just ran out the back
door and I came over here.

716
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:45,559
(dog barking)
I just...

717
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:50,393
I can't let my mom
see me like this.

718
00:33:50,427 --> 00:33:51,693
Can I come in?

719
00:33:51,726 --> 00:33:54,427
Please? Can I just...?
Of course, you can.

720
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:56,226
Sure. Come on.

721
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,893
(sobbing):
Allie...

722
00:34:04,926 --> 00:34:07,492
I don't know what
would have happened

723
00:34:07,526 --> 00:34:11,193
if his dad hadn't come hom

724
00:34:11,226 --> 00:34:13,526
I really don't.

725
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:17,626
Yeah, well... I do.

726
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:20,226
I know.

727
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,283
Can I throw these
out somewhere?

728
00:34:33,284 --> 00:34:35,818
I don't want to
take a chance on
my mom seeing them.

729
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:37,117
Yeah, sure.

730
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:44,985
I really think we
need to tell someone.

731
00:34:45,017 --> 00:34:47,518
Tell them what?

732
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:51,618
Tell 'em... that he scared me?
That he's a jerk?

733
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:53,951
Last night, you
said that...
Yeah. Well...

734
00:34:53,985 --> 00:34:57,017
Last night I was upset.

735
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,484
Today I see that I'm fine

736
00:34:58,518 --> 00:35:00,184
and that nothing
really happened.

737
00:35:01,322 --> 00:35:02,956
Not really.

738
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,322
But Izzy...

739
00:35:05,356 --> 00:35:07,955
what if you knew he was
going to do it again?

740
00:35:07,956 --> 00:35:09,490
But worse.

741
00:35:09,522 --> 00:35:11,789
What if you knew other girls
were going to get hurt?

742
00:35:11,822 --> 00:35:13,655
Is this dream talk again?

743
00:35:13,689 --> 00:35:15,822
Listen to me.

744
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:17,489
I don't know anything about
the future, Allison,

745
00:35:17,522 --> 00:35:19,689
and neither do you.

746
00:35:19,722 --> 00:35:22,856
This is about me.

747
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:28,856
This is about something that
really happened to me.

748
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:32,923
And that means I get to decide
what to do about it.

749
00:35:33,362 --> 00:35:34,895
I'm sorry.

750
00:35:34,928 --> 00:35:36,229
Promise me.

751
00:35:36,262 --> 00:35:39,329
Promise me you won't tell anyone
about this.

752
00:35:42,962 --> 00:35:44,662
Allison, promise me.

753
00:35:46,126 --> 00:35:47,658
And promise me

754
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:49,626
we'll never talk
about this again.

755
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:50,925
Izzy...

756
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:53,891
Promise me!

757
00:35:56,558 --> 00:35:58,259
I promise.

758
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:03,915
Okay.

759
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:08,191
Well, I guess I better go.

760
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:12,592
Izzy?

761
00:36:16,392 --> 00:36:19,325
This is it, isn't it?

762
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,126
We're not gonna be friends
after this, are we?

763
00:36:23,191 --> 00:36:27,592
Why are you saying that?

764
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:29,925
Isn't there enough bad already?

765
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:31,158
Why do you say that?

766
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:35,059
I don't know.

767
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:38,059
It's just a feeling I have.

768
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:52,625
Oh, good, you're here.

769
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:56,191
Uh, Stacey called in sick--
lazy, hung-over tramp--

770
00:36:56,225 --> 00:36:57,992
so I have to cover her shift.

771
00:36:58,026 --> 00:37:01,558
And, uh, can you bring
these cookies over

772
00:37:01,592 --> 00:37:02,625
to the Campbells' house

773
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:05,710
along with that note
inviting Mr. Campbell

774
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,609
over for dinner next week?

775
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,310
Mom, the last place
in the world I want to go

776
00:37:10,343 --> 00:37:11,442
is the Campbell house.

777
00:37:11,443 --> 00:37:13,243
Why, did you and
Stephen have a fight?

778
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:14,776
No.

779
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:16,676
What's the problem, then?

780
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:20,743
I can't talk about it,
but I'm not going over there.

781
00:37:20,776 --> 00:37:22,809
I'm asking you, please.

782
00:37:22,843 --> 00:37:24,410
No.

783
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:27,143
I don't ask
for much from you.

784
00:37:27,176 --> 00:37:32,010
Tips are lousy, your dad's
child-support payment is late,

785
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:34,176
and the car needs new
brake pads

786
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,743
I can't pay for.

787
00:37:35,776 --> 00:37:37,642
So do this one
thing for me,

788
00:37:37,676 --> 00:37:40,976
okay, without
giving me any attitude.

789
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:47,943
Okay.

790
00:38:55,909 --> 00:38:58,709
I talked to the police.

791
00:38:58,743 --> 00:39:01,943
He shot himself.

792
00:39:01,976 --> 00:39:06,943
I'm so sorry, honey,
but he's dead.

793
00:39:09,343 --> 00:39:11,809
I'm-I'm... I'm sorry.

794
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,277
I know you cared
about him.

795
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:17,943
I did.

796
00:39:17,976 --> 00:39:19,210
I really did.

797
00:39:19,243 --> 00:39:21,210
I know.

798
00:39:22,003 --> 00:39:23,836
Would you like me to give you
something...

799
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,102
help you sleep?

800
00:39:26,136 --> 00:39:30,570
Actually, I'm...

801
00:39:30,603 --> 00:39:32,703
I'm kinda scared to dream.

802
00:39:32,736 --> 00:39:35,469
That's silly.

803
00:39:35,503 --> 00:39:41,803
The thing a person needs most
at a time like this is sleep.

804
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:48,703
And the thing a person
needs to do the most is forget.

805
00:40:24,937 --> 00:40:25,870
Bye!

806
00:40:25,903 --> 00:40:27,770
Bye, Mom!

807
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,751
Oh, I forgot. I'm supposed
to stay after school

808
00:40:32,751 --> 00:40:34,150
and work
with my new lab partner,

809
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:35,916
so can you pick me up at 4:30?

810
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,516
Well, this is a heck of a time
to mention it, Ariel.

811
00:40:38,517 --> 00:40:39,917
I have the meeting
this afternoon.

812
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,017
I know. I'm sorry.

813
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,483
Um... wait.

814
00:40:43,517 --> 00:40:44,483
Nancy!

815
00:40:46,034 --> 00:40:47,849
Do you think your mom
could drop me at home

816
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:48,883
after we're done working?

817
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:50,284
Sure, I guess
that'd be okay.

818
00:40:50,317 --> 00:40:52,350
Mom, this is Nancy Claymore.

819
00:40:52,384 --> 00:40:53,650
She just started here this week.

820
00:40:53,683 --> 00:40:55,583
Hi, Mrs. Dubois.

821
00:40:55,616 --> 00:40:57,650
So her mom's

822
00:40:57,683 --> 00:40:59,117
gonna drop me
at home later, okay?

823
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,284
Well, sure, that's okay.

824
00:41:01,317 --> 00:41:02,883
Nancy, you look so familiar.

825
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:04,317
Have we met before?

826
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:06,483
Um, I don't think so.

827
00:41:06,516 --> 00:41:09,516
Must be my imagination.

828
00:41:10,549 --> 00:41:20,549
