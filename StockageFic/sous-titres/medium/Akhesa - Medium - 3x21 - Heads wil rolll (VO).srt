Previously on Medium

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,880
Gunshots have reportedly been fired
inside the offices of Aerodytech

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,410
Has anyone seen Joe Dubois?

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,810
So, are you ready for this?

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,180
As ready as I'll ever be.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,740
- Welcome back Joe!
- Thank you

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,400
Is everything ok at work?

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,450
Everything is fine.

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,590
Something seems wrong.

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,590
<i>Mrs. Dubois,</i>

11
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,590
my name is Marcus Canty.

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,790
I work with your husband.

13
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,150
Since he's come back to work,

14
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,920
<i>he hasn't been attending any meetings,</i>

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,950
<i>he hasn't been making any phone calls.</i>

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,420
<i>Your boss called.</i>

17
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,890
They said they might
want you to see someone.

18
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,320
My name is Cooper Conroy.

19
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,490
I'm an attorney,Mr. Dubois.

20
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,720
Can you talk for a moment?

21
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,190
Talk about what?

22
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,620
About millions of dollars I
believe you're entitled to.

23
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,820
<i>I dream the same dream every night,</i>

24
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,990
and there is nothing
circumstantial about it.

25
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,650
We're going to finish trying this case.

26
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,990
We're going to trust the jury.

27
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,320
We find the defendant

28
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,650
guilty of murder in the first degree.

29
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,590
Thank you for the encouragement.

30
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,320
I work for the District Attorney,

31
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,650
Manuel Devalos.

32
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,820
It's not that exciting.

33
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,090
Easy for you to say.

34
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,320
You don't sell
pharmaceuticals for a living.

35
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,350
So...

36
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,350
what's it like working for the DA?

37
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,220
I thought you needed
to see this. Oh,my God.

38
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,190
It's Natalie Paxton's head
on Ramona Hensley's body.

39
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,720
<i>City Hall is already being inundated</i>

40
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,950
with people calling for
the immediate release

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,690
of Walter Paxton.

42
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,520
You're expecting a call today...

43
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,790
...or maybe a text?

44
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,190
<i>My husband's kind of
going through something.</i>

45
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,690
Well,now we know where the head

46
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,220
of the third victim ended up.

47
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,620
So who's the body belong to?

48
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,190
Driver's license photo.

49
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,770
Hey,Dad.

50
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,320
Evening,son.

51
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,380
<i>So...</i>

52
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,890
what's all the hubbub?

53
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,390
Huh?

54
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,120
What's so important you needed
to raise me from the dead?

55
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,560
Well,I was just kind
of reviewing my options,

56
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,590
contemplating my future.

57
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,220
Well,you know,I don't get you.

58
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,490
I don't know what you're talking about.

59
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,790
What's to contemplate?

60
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,320
I mean,your future's right here.

61
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,090
You got the,the two kids...

62
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,790
Three.

63
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,390
...the happy marriage
to Haley Joel Osment.

64
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,390
Yeah,I know,I know.

65
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,790
I just...

66
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,290
There were five of us in that room,Dad.

67
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,390
Only two of us made it out alive.

68
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,820
Why me?

69
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,020
Why not them?

70
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,920
Because.

71
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,620
That's it?

72
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,160
That's your answer?

73
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,420
"Because"?

74
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,220
You know what your problem is?

75
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,290
You've never been in a war.

76
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,790
My generation... we saw death,

77
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,320
contemplated our own
mortality when we were young

78
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,590
so we didn't have to waste

79
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,020
the rest of our lives worrying about it.

80
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,590
We realized that death
takes care of itself.

81
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,060
It's life that needs your attention.

82
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,520
Life,huh?

83
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,660
Look,you got a great job.
You got a hot little wife.

84
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,990
You got a couple of nice kids,

85
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,690
and here you are
wondering why you're alive.

86
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,120
You know what you need to do?

87
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,290
What's that?

88
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,290
You need to wake up. Oh,really?

89
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,620
I mean it.

90
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,060
Honey,I need you to wake up.

91
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,290
Honey? Darling.

92
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,260
Please,just wake up.

93
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,860
Wait a second. No,I'm confused.

94
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,860
Why should I?

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,990
Give me one good reason.

96
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,690
Because I need to talk to
you about a dream I just had.

97
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,920
<i>So they found your friend's body</i>

98
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,590
with the head of the third victim on it?

99
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,220
That would make your
friend the fourth victim.

100
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,420
Uh-huh.

101
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,760
To be honest,I don't think the
issue is as much who to call

102
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,320
as it is what to say.

103
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,560
Well,I have to tell someone.

104
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,920
What are you going to tell them?

105
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,360
"I don't know who the next victim is,

106
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,460
but I can tell you about
the one after that"?

107
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,620
<i>It's not as if you know when
any of this is going to happen.</i>

108
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,260
Are you saying I shouldn't tell anybody?

109
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,660
I don't know.

110
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,790
Keep in mind this is a dream
you had after two martinis.

111
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,390
Uh... I'm not telling you

112
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,520
how to do your job.

113
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,590
I'm just saying that I don't think

114
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,190
there's anyone to call tonight.

115
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,920
Right.

116
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,960
Speaking of calling,how's your phone?

117
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,960
Very clean.

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,160
Useless,but very clean.

119
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,390
Melinda had her baby...

120
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,320
and that's who keeps texting me.

121
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,290
She asked about you,by the way.

122
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,860
How you're doing.

123
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,420
How you're doing with me.

124
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,820
Tell her not very well.

125
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,590
But I'm determined to change that.

126
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,760
Yeah.

127
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,890
Me,too.

- Alligator.
- Morning.

135
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,700
Dad,where's Mom? Let me switch rooms.

136
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,730
Still sleeping,sweetie.

137
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,030
Can you give her another one?

138
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,570
Okay,let's see.

139
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,570
Here's one.

140
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,600
Jocular.

141
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,930
Hi.

142
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,070
What can I do for you,Mr. Conroy?

143
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,000
At the risk of sounding like a cliche?

144
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,000
this call is about
what I can do for you.

145
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,900
I thought we left it that you
were going to wait for my call.

146
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,270
And I would have,but you didn't call.

147
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,670
Usually when I mention

148
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,830
that there's potentially
millions of dollars involved,

149
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,470
people at least let me
buy them a cup of coffee.

150
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,700
You do drink coffee,don't
you,Mr. Dubois?

151
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,870
You were looking for me?

152
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,100
Yeah,I was.

153
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,400
The name P.D. McCall ring a bell?

154
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,730
I'm sorry?

155
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,870
Couple of months ago,

156
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,930
you told me about a
reporter from out of town

157
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,600
who was calling you,asking
questions about this office,

158
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,870
certain particulars about
the Sonny Troyer case.

159
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,430
Do you remember the
name of that reporter?

160
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,970
Not off the top of my head.

161
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:45,670
I can look it up if it's important.

162
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,000
Amid the flood of articles
from around the country

163
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,770
suggesting that,uh,

164
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,130
I completely misjudged this situation,

165
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,330
did you happen to see this one?

166
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,230
"Aggressive DA's Office

167
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,800
Finally Undone by Recapitator. "

168
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,800
Undone by what?

169
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,200
The Recapitator.

170
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,270
That's what they're calling our killer.

171
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,300
He doesn't just decapitate these women,

172
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,370
he re-capitates them,

173
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,800
putting the head of his last victim

174
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,500
on the body of his current one.

175
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,770
Clever.

176
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,570
Anyway,this P.D. McCall

177
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,230
points out that if I had at
least entertained the deal

178
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,300
that Paxton's attorney was shopping,

179
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,000
that the judge most
certainly would have suspended

180
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,770
the trial prior to the verdict,

181
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:30,300
and we wouldn't be in
the mess we're in now.

182
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,170
An opinion I know you share.

183
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,200
Manny,I never said
that to anyone but you.

184
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,600
Of course not.

185
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,130
I just can't figure out

186
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,130
<i>why this national reporter
is coming after my scalp.</i>

187
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,000
District Attorney's
Office,Allison Dubois speaking.

188
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,300
Are you that blonde I
saw inhaling martinis

189
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,570
at the hotel bar last night?

190
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,070
Uh,who am I speaking with?

191
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,370
It's your drinking buddy,Drinking Buddy.

192
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,730
How you holding up this morning?

193
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,200
I'm surviving.

194
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,600
My husband let me sleep
in a bit,which was nice.

195
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,830
It's my boss I'm worried about.

196
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,130
Every two minutes,

197
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,130
they bring in another
stack of newspaper articles

198
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,130
about how he bungled

199
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,000
the whole Paxton thing.

200
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,570
He looks so defeated.

201
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,400
Let's change the subject.

202
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,500
What are you doing?

203
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,370
I am killing time
before a client meeting.

204
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,070
Why? You want to get another drink?

205
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,000
Yes,but I can't.

206
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,030
Actually,I'm glad you called.

207
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,930
I wanted to ask you a question.

208
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh,excellent.

209
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,630
You ask the questions for a change.

210
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,570
How long are you going to be in town?

211
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,770
Why? Hubby jealous?

212
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:38,770
No,I'm serious.

213
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,470
Last night when I left,

214
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,600
I thought about you in
that hotel by yourself.

215
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,700
I kind of like the way you look
with your head on your own neck.

216
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,970
You are really sweet
in a deeply twisted way.

217
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,030
I am here for as long as it takes me

218
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,230
to get my work done,but
don't be concerned.

219
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,170
There's thousands of
hotel rooms in Phoenix

220
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,530
and only one Recapitator.

221
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,970
Recapitator?

222
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,670
Oh,my God,I just heard someone
call him that in the elevator.

223
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,270
I can't believe a civilian like you

224
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,030
is already acting like that's his name.

225
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,100
<i>That is his name and I like it.</i>

226
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,930
I told you
- Court TV junkie.

227
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,570
So... give me some dirt.

228
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,200
What are the police
saying about the connection

229
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,270
between Paxton's wife
and this new victim?

230
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,600
Well,that's what's scary.

231
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,900
There doesn't seem to be a
connection other than the fact

232
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,500
that they were both alone
in expensive hotel rooms.

233
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,500
It seems completely random,

234
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,730
which is why,as much as
I enjoy having you around,

235
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,430
I sure would feel much better

236
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,500
if you left town until
we catch this guy.

237
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,870
Or- I don't know-
come stay at my house.

238
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,600
You can be the referee
between me and my husband.

239
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,870
Sorry,I like my job
and I like room service,

240
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,770
but I'd love to do the cocktail
or the lunch thing again.

241
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,030
Anyway,you know what?

242
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,300
I got to go.

243
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,800
For crying out loud,you
work for politicians,girl.

244
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,670
Stop worrying about my neck
and watch out for your own.

245
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,100
<i>Sorry to keep you waiting.</i>

246
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,270
I had a doctor's appointment.

247
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,700
Company-ordered therapy.

248
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,330
Eh,it's pretty standard
in situations like this.

249
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,700
Forgive me; situations like what?

250
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,900
I think what I've been
through is fairly unique.

251
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,930
I didn't mean to diminish
the impact it's had

252
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,700
on you or,or your life.

253
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,170
That's the reason I'm here.

254
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,930
I've actually had quite a bit
of experience in this area.

255
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,970
And what is "this area"?

256
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,570
Suing the companies where
the,where the violence occurs?

257
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,100
Aren't they victims in all this,too?

258
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,700
I mean,they didn't tell my co-worker

259
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,930
to bring a gun to work,

260
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,800
much less use it against his colleagues.

261
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,500
And if you really want
to start assigning blame,

262
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,330
he wasn't even an employee.

263
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,900
He was fired.

264
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,330
He used my ID to get in the front gate.

265
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,770
I gave it to him.

266
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,070
If you wanted to,

267
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,830
you could argue that the
whole thing was my fault.

268
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,800
Guy brings a gun to work,kills
himself and two others.

269
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,800
My fault.

270
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,970
Three guns.

271
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,670
Excuse me?

272
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,970
<i>He came to the office with three guns.</i>

273
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,170
Right.

274
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,630
Aerodytech is a government contractor.

275
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,970
The sensitive nature of their work means

276
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,500
that they're a target for terrorists,

277
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,900
disgruntled employees,and competitors.

278
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,370
And you're telling me you think
it's okay that the only thing

279
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,700
standing between Aerodytech
and Bruce Rossiter's guns

280
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,370
was your ID at an
unmanned security gate?

281
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,370
Mr. Dubois,these people

282
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,230
did not take adequate precautions

283
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,000
to protect the country,its
secrets,or their employees.

284
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,100
Stop working so hard to defend them.

285
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,130
They certainly didn't
do much to defend you.

286
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,500
It's me,the hunter-gatherer.

287
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,330
I bring food

288
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,300
and communications
from the outside world.

289
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,000
In here.

290
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,200
Daddy's home.

291
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,300
Can I steal you for a minute?

292
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,530
Bridge,would you finish
setting the table for Mommy?

293
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,400
I can't decide if this guy's our savior

294
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,870
or Mephistopheles in lawyer's clothing.

295
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,770
There's something about his intensity.

296
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,100
On the one hand,I love the fact

297
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,470
that he might be working for us,

298
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,030
and on the other hand,I
feel ashamed of myself

299
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,270
for hiring somebody like
that to do our bidding.

300
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,170
Why are you smiling? What
are you smiling about?

301
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,900
You're talking to me. I miss that.

302
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,230
I honestly just don't know what to do.

303
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,930
I like Aerodytech.

304
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,430
And it just seems wrong when I...

305
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,500
when I think about my dead friends,

306
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,100
and I think about that awful day,

307
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,830
to be thinking about money.

308
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,600
Maybe that's naive.

309
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,700
I mean,what would I say to Mr. Canty?

310
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,600
Oh,my God,he called you.

311
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,300
Left you a message on
the answering machine.

312
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,430
I didn't get a chance to tell you.

313
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,330
He wants to have lunch
with you tomorrow.

314
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,370
See,I already feel like I'm cheating
on him by having this conversation.

315
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,400
He said "millions of dollars. "

316
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,030
Maybe "tens of millions of dollars. "

317
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,370
All right,ladies and
gentlemen,five women are dead now,

318
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,730
all brutally murdered
by the same sociopath.

319
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,970
Are you embarrassed?

320
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,870
Are you ashamed?

321
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,600
I know I am.

322
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,230
Our local hotels and restaurants
are losing millions in revenue.

323
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,130
Our convention center is empty.

324
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,730
Every day brings a new cancellation.

325
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,000
And our Chamber of
Commerce is telling me

326
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,230
that it will take years
to shake off the perception

327
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,770
of Phoenix as an unsafe city to visit.

328
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,070
Well,I won'have it.

329
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,100
Not on my watch.

330
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,240
I'm not going down like my predecessor.

331
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,060
I like being the new DA of Phoenix.

332
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,660
Huh?

333
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,900
There's another murder after Debra's.

334
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,250
Huh?

335
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,380
I said,"There's another
murder after Debra's. "

336
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,110
I'm sorry. I know that
you said something to me

337
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,640
'cause I saw your mouth was moving.

338
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,270
It was awful.

339
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,280
Five women killed.

340
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,570
Debra and then another one,

341
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,460
and Devalos wasn't the DA anymore.

342
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,690
They got rid of him.

343
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,930
Okay,okay.

344
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,630
So this is in the future?

345
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,660
Yeah. But you don't
know specifically when?

346
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,660
What can I do that I
haven't already done?

347
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,910
I tried to convince
Debra she was in danger.

348
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,540
She wouldn't believe me.

349
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,530
What am I going to do? Tell my boss,

350
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,210
"Hey,now might be a great time

351
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,320
"for you to get that resume out there.

352
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,860
Check out the DA wanted ads"?

353
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,530
What,laughing,sleepy boy?

354
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,390
You going to make some more fun of me?

355
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,160
No,I'm not making fun of you.

356
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,460
I just seems to me like
this is just a math problem.

357
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,860
What's a math problem?

358
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,390
You said there are five victims

359
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,390
and that your friend
is the fourth victim.

360
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,960
And you implied that Devalos gets fired

361
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,260
after the death of the fifth girl.

362
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,230
So it just seems pretty obvious
to me what you've got to do.

363
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,730
Okay.

364
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,260
Well,just don't let
your friend get murdered.

365
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,830
Then your friend lives;

366
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,260
Devalos doesn't get fired;

367
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,930
there is no fifth victim;

368
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,790
everyone lives happily...

369
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,230
well,I suppose the third
victim is not that happy,but...

370
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,730
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

371
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,890
All right,I'm not making myself clear.

372
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,090
Okay,if your friend
is the fourth victim,

373
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,930
then just don't let her be.

374
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,290
Put her under surveillance.

375
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,890
Don't let her out of your sight.

376
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,790
You know this guy is going
to come and look for her,

377
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,230
so just be there when he does.

378
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,690
Stop the murder,stop the murderer.

379
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,530
I need you to do something for me.

380
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,530
Joe? Hey,Marcus.

381
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,260
How are you? Texting my wife.

382
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,190
New phone,does everything
but make coffee.

383
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,230
That's nice.

384
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,090
You're looking good. Relaxed.

385
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,690
I talked to Dr. Myers.

386
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,890
He's very pleased about everything.

387
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,430
Joe,we miss you.

388
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,830
Hey,I miss being there.

389
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,060
I don't know what happened
that week I came back...

390
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,530
Doesn't matter. Myers
says you're better.

391
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,330
So if you're willing,

392
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,790
you and your,uh,new phone...

393
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,360
More than willing.

394
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,090
Um...

395
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,790
What's this?

396
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,590
It's your annual bonus check.

397
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,960
Postdated,you won't be able

398
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,660
to cash it for a few weeks,but
we wanted you to have it.

399
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,630
So you know what we were thinking.

400
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,990
It's a little
premature,isn't it? It's May.

401
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,290
Well,given everything that's happened...

402
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,530
I know.

403
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,130
It's probably four times
what you were expecting.

404
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,730
Closer to five.

405
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,530
You know,I can hear you're in a hurry

406
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,690
to get back to work,but the truth is,

407
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,890
if you wanted a couple more weeks-

408
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,360
no doctors,no anything-

409
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,190
just a real vacation,

410
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,990
we would certainly understand.

411
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,260
Everything all right?

412
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,730
I won't lie to you.

413
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,090
You go through an
experience like this...

414
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,730
...and you start looking
at all your options.

415
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,960
Looking back on your
whole professional life

416
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,230
wondering if it was
really as meaningful...

417
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,830
as you remember it being.

418
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,660
Wondering if the people that
you've given your life to...

419
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,830
...well,if any of it
actually matters to them.

420
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,330
Well,I hope you can see that it did...

421
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,030
that it does.

422
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,530
You just need to take your time.

423
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,960
Make sure you're ready.

424
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,330
Then come back and we'll
hit the ground running.

425
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,230
Thank you.

426
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,930
To the future.

427
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,230
Oh,actually,

428
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,030
there is one little
thing I need you to do

429
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,660
sooner rather than later.

430
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,690
Just over the weekend,take it home,

431
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,830
and when you get a chance,uh,read
it over and then sign it.

432
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,490
I'm sorry,Marcus. What is this?

433
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,930
Oh,it's just a standard form.

434
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,560
The insurance company
wanted us to give it to you.

435
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,690
It's,uh,some kind

436
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,560
of liability waiver.

437
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,490
"I,Joseph Dubois,hereby
release Aerodytech,

438
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,490
"its officers and
shareholders from any claim,

439
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,060
"future or past,relating to events

440
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,230
occurring on or off
company property... "

441
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,160
You mind if I have an
attorney take a look at this?

442
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,860
Of course not.

443
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,060
It's a little awkward,but,uh...

444
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,860
I need to have that back
before you can return to work.

445
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,490
Excuse me?

446
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,030
It's not us. It's the insurance company.

447
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,290
They're insisting we get
your signature on those

448
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,190
before we can bring you back.

449
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,960
You understand.

450
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,030
Marcus,are you saying
that if I don't sign these,

451
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,260
I can't come back to work?

452
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,890
No,I'm not saying that.

453
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,390
They can't do that.

454
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,190
Aerodytech can't do that.

455
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,360
You can't fire someone without cause.

456
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,190
Joe,please don't go down this road.

457
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,930
There's always cause.
They'll find cause.

458
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,960
No! There is no cause.

459
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,760
What did I do?

460
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,860
I sat there for eight hours

461
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,260
with a gun pointed at me

462
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,730
and tried to reason with a man.

463
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,060
That's cause?! That's not cause.

464
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,660
How about not showing up

465
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,460
for your company-mandated
therapy last week?

466
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,090
The insurance company
seems to think that's cause.

467
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,260
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

468
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,560
We haven't even ordered yet.

469
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,560
I'm not hungry.

470
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,560
I want you to think about this.

471
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,760
There's a lot of money in that envelope.

472
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,960
And who knows,maybe I
could get you a little more.

473
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,390
You...

474
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,160
<i>I'm telling you,I didn't
know what to think.</i>

475
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,490
It felt like an ultimatum.

476
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,160
I came this close to calling that lawyer

477
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,930
and saying,"Let's go. "

478
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,430
Well,maybe Mr. Canty was being honest.

479
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,830
I'm sure their insurance company

480
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,930
is terrified that you're going to sue.

481
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,190
I'm sure they do want
them to get you to sign

482
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,460
some kind of waiver or something.

483
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,260
The good news is they're not
dropping you like a hot potato.

484
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,430
They're throwing money
at you to get you to stay.

485
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,090
They just don't want you to
turn around a year from now

486
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,760
and drag them into court.

487
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,590
Well,it's not like
they're throwing millions,

488
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,590
certainly not tens of millions.

489
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,530
I don't know. Of course there's

490
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,190
no guarantee that if I do sue...

491
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,890
Do me a favor. Dream about us tonight.

492
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,560
Tell me what I should do.

493
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,030
Well,that's not fair.

494
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,390
If I tell you what to do,who's
going to tell me what to do?

495
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,290
What are you talking about?
You don't need advice.

496
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,460
You know everything before
it happens. Not true.

497
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,460
That little piece of advice
you gave me this morning?

498
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,860
Yeah,that worked out for you?

499
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,860
I went right to Scanlon,told
him he had to put Debra

500
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,630
under 24-hour surveillance.

501
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,660
That's my girl.

502
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,630
And I told him about some filthy,

503
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,430
dirty text messages I got this morning.

504
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,890
I'd like to have him
investigate to put a stop to it.

505
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,290
Oh,really? You want those to stop,huh?

506
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,990
Someone is feeling better.

507
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,290
What can I tell you?

508
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,290
It's a triumph of the human spirit.

509
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,190
Sorry,ma'am.

510
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,730
I didn't realize you were
here. I'll come back later.

511
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,390
Ma'am,are you okay?

512
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,530
Ma'am?

513
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,720
A maid found her in the hotel bathtub.

514
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,000
And we're sure it's this... Recapitator.

515
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,140
Not some copycat?

516
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,940
The previous victim's
head was there as well.

517
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,100
I got here as quickly as I could.

518
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,770
You okay?

519
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,070
I'd rather be at the scene.

520
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,500
I'd rather not be looking at pictures.

521
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,770
But when the mayor asks
you to sit this one out...

522
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,900
When the governor asks
you to sit this one out...

523
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,900
Press is getting pretty vicious.

524
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,240
Care to see the carnage?

525
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,340
That's okay.

526
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,400
I've seen it.

527
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,500
So,who was she?

528
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,740
Cheryl Ann Potts,24 years old.

529
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,140
In town for her sister's wedding.

530
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,100
This is what she looked like

531
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,840
when she was still in one piece.

532
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,740
This is the girl I was telling
you about yesterday,Lee.

533
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,300
Red hair. Pretty.

534
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,370
It was her head that
ends up on Debra's body.

535
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,670
We can't allow it to happen.

536
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,800
Wait a second.

537
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,700
What are you talking about?

538
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,100
We knew about this girl?

539
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,270
And who's this Debra?

540
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,270
Debra's a friend of mine.

541
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,470
I had a dream that she was
going to be the fourth victim.

542
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,800
I had no idea who the third
victim was going to be,

543
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,000
other than

544
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,540
what her head looked
like on Debra's body.

545
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,840
And...?

546
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,940
And I've been doing some
pretty fancy footwork

547
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,200
and we've had Debra under surveillance

548
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,570
since yesterday afternoon.

549
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,570
Of course,nobody knows
why they're watching her,

550
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,140
and she has no idea
that she's being watched.

551
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,600
Well,that may have to change.

552
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,300
I can't sit by and just let
this woman go about her business

553
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,540
when we have reason to believe

554
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,040
that she could be the next victim.

555
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,040
It's not as if our people are
in the hotel room with her.

556
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,970
We have to be smart about it,though,

557
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,840
given the way we came
into this information.

558
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,040
I can't go to her,and
neither can you,Lee.

559
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,670
It has to come from you,Allison,

560
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,170
as a friend.

561
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,000
Explain to her that you've
been working on this case.

562
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,200
You've just become privy

563
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,770
to some highly classified
information and...

564
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,100
you believe she may be a target.

565
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,840
See if you can get her
to leave town for a while,

566
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,940
stay with friends...

567
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,070
I tried that.

568
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,800
Well,try again. Try harder.

569
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,800
It's not often in life that we
get a chance to thwart disaster.

570
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,400
Let's not have to look back

571
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,740
and regret what we could have done.

572
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,500
Hey!

573
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,740
Wow.

574
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,240
You really are persistent.

575
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,100
First I get a cell
phone full of messages

576
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,340
and then you show up here.

577
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,970
Allison,I really would
have called you back.

578
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,070
Is something the matter?

579
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,740
Okay,you know what?

580
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,800
I'm gonna change my clothes
and I'll meet you downstairs

581
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,040
in the bar in ten minutes.

582
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,440
No,the bar won't work.

583
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,600
Are you alone?

584
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,170
Um...

585
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,340
Yeah,I'm alone,but I'm also a pig.

586
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,700
My... my room's a nightmare
even after housekeeping,so.

587
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,940
Oh,it doesn't matter.

588
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,340
Okay.

589
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,700
Sorry,yeah,come in.

590
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,900
REPORTER ... winds,expect
a high near 52 degrees.

591
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,100
Clear tonight,with a low near 41.

592
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,440
This just in: the body
of Cheryl Ann Potts,

593
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,970
found beheaded in her hotel room

594
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,740
earlier today...

595
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,740
Sit.

596
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,640
It... Sit.

597
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,040
Sorry.

598
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,540
I'm expecting a call.

599
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,640
Mmm.

600
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,970
Can I get you a drink?

601
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,300
Mini-drink from
my mini-bar?

602
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:14,270
I'm terrified for you.

603
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,740
Okay.

604
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,270
You know what,Allison?

605
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,840
This has got to stop.

606
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,700
You... are watching
way too much television,

607
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,640
reading way too many newspapers.

608
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,200
Do you know how many hotel
rooms there are in Phoenix?

609
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,740
I do.

610
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,000
I researched it

611
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,900
after the last time you brought this up.

612
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:37,800
Depending on how you count,over 55,000.

613
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,670
I feel totally safe.

614
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,900
Well,you're not.

615
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,070
Not in this hotel.

616
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,240
Not in that bed.

617
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,240
Okay.

618
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,270
I need a drink.

619
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,240
Debra,this is what I do all day:

620
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,500
work on this case;

621
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,370
sift through information;
meet with detectives.

622
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,940
And today...

623
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,340
I can't tell you very much,but...

624
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,340
I was given some
information,some intelligence.

625
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,000
You're his next target.

626
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,170
You.

627
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,800
Really?

628
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,140
Me?

629
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,500
Why?

630
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,370
You,you think he's looking
for free drug samples?

631
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,100
This isn't funny.

632
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,100
I'm not laughing.

633
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,100
You see this?

634
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,440
This is how I live most of the time:

635
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,770
out of a suitcase,

636
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,900
from one strange hotel room to another.

637
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,570
And you come along and you say

638
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,570
"Debra,I need you to pay attention.

639
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,570
I need you to get good and scared. "

640
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:36,240
And you don't understand.

641
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,840
You're telling a pilot
that flying isn't safe.

642
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,170
You're telling a heart surgeon

643
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,170
that it's unhealthy
to handle human blood.

644
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,670
This is my life.

645
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,270
This is how I make my living.

646
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,740
So you're going to have
to tell me something more

647
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,940
than just "you're next. "

648
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,370
I mean,how can you be so sure?

649
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,370
Did you guys get a list?

650
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,800
Do,do I have something in common

651
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,040
with the other women who died?

652
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,200
I told you.

653
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,200
I can't tell you how
I got my information

654
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,800
or even the nature of my information.

655
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,340
Just that I believe it
to be extremely accurate.

656
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,740
No offense,Allison,

657
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,740
but if this information is so accurate,

658
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,670
then why did they send you to tell me?

659
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,170
Where's the District Attorney?

660
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,170
Where's the Chief of Police?

661
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,140
I mean,if I called your boss
right now,would he back you up?

662
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,500
I don't know.

663
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,500
I don't know if he could.

664
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,300
No,with everything that's going on,

665
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,640
you shouldn't call him.

666
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,940
Okay,well,you've certainly
given me a lot to think about.

667
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,540
I swear on my children's lives

668
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,200
what I am telling you is true.

669
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,100
Okay.

670
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,170
Will you call me?

671
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,170
Will you tell me what you decide?

672
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,670
You know,the offer's still open.

673
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,170
You can come stay at my house.

674
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,170
I honestly don't think
that's going to be necessary.

675
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,640
I have to tell you something.

676
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,200
Something else?

677
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,940
This is going to sound crazy.

678
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,940
Ever since I was a little girl...

679
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,670
I've seen things... dreamt things.

680
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,100
It took me a long time to understand

681
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,100
that they were messages...

682
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,100
messages from dead people,

683
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,240
showing me things that had happened,

684
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,740
things that were going to happen.

685
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,740
You dream messages from dead people?

686
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,740
All of my life.

687
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,570
And my work with the District Attorney

688
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,770
is almost exclusively about that,

689
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,770
about victims coming to me...

690
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,000
telling me things,showing me things...

691
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,070
things that make it possible

692
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,440
for the District Attorney
and I to obtain justice

693
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,940
for those who have passed...

694
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,270
and once in a while,

695
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,940
like now...

696
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,740
to stop something horrible
from ever happening.

697
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,600
So you dream these things

698
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,240
and then you tell the District Attorney,

699
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,240
and he listens?

700
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,840
Anyone else?

701
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,440
My husband.

702
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,770
Obviously.

703
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,200
And a detective

704
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,540
on the force and a woman
in the mayor's office,

705
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,200
and now you.

706
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,540
Okay.

707
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,000
I saw you,Debra,on that bed.

708
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,340
He took your head...

709
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,600
and in its place was the
head of Cheryl Ann Potts,

710
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,140
the third victim,the woman he killed

711
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,140
last night.

712
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,140
Okay.

713
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,740
What was I wearing?

714
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,440
Work clothes.

715
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,640
Not a robe or underwear?

716
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,640
So as long as I don't change

717
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,870
I guess I'm... I'm safe for tonight?

718
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,400
You don't believe me.

719
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,540
We do have officers watching you.

720
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,440
We have since yesterday.

721
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,640
You won't see them,or
at least you shouldn't,

722
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,870
but if you get in trouble...

723
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,200
Okay,you know what? I,I...

724
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,740
I have my magic robe and
my invisible bodyguards.

725
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,170
And I really need you to leave now.

726
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:57,000
You will call me?

727
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:59,470
You will think about
everything I have told you

728
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,140
and you will call me?

729
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,100
Please?

730
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,730
I will call you

731
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,120
Hi,I'm Howie Mandel.

732
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:21,080
<i>Welcome to Deal or No Deal.</i>

733
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,350
Thank you.

734
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:25,320
...I've always said,

735
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,340
I have the best audience in the world...

736
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,040
Hey,babies.

737
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,500
Any of you know where Daddy is?

738
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,780
...I promise to take great
care of you tonight. I promise.

739
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,120
And what does taking great
care of you mean? It means...

740
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,230
When did Howie Mandel
become our baby-sitter?

741
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,950
What can I tell you? He was available

742
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,330
and the price was right.

743
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,720
I wasn't expecting you home so early.

744
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,150
Shouldn't you be ordering your
second drink right about now?

745
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:54,350
No drinks were ordered,at
least not by me.

746
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,950
Remember that conversation we had

747
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,750
about how hard it is for me
to make friends and keep them?

748
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,620
Nothing's changed.

749
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,980
I'm sorry.

750
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,020
She thinks I'm insane.

751
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,520
You know,I'm actually praying

752
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,550
with all of my heart

753
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,440
that she's proven right.

754
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,130
I called Scanlon.

755
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,620
They tripled the detail watching her.

756
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,410
Even got the hotel to agree

757
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,430
to let us put guards in the hall.

758
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,150
I really don't know what else to do.

759
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,140
All you can do is all you can do.

760
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:31,960
Well,I did it all.

761
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,810
I even told her how I knew.

762
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,040
Wow.

763
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,620
Did that help?

764
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,850
No.

765
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,880
It made things worse.

766
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,220
So,how was your day?

767
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,750
I dodged calls from the lawyer.

768
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,780
Dodged calls from my boss.

769
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,120
Flipped a lot of coins.

770
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,450
Nothing new.

771
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:54,020
Well,I'm going to go
put the girls to sleep.

772
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,020
Okay.

773
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,550
Next contestant is...

774
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,580
Allison Dubois.

775
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,280
Allison!

776
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,920
Allison.

777
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,230
Allison,come on up.

778
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,310
I... I do this.

779
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,300
I do this.

780
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,460
Thank you. Uh...

781
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,410
<i>Welcome to Deal or No Deal.</i>

782
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,510
Tell me a little bit
about yourself. Uh...

783
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,180
I'm live in Phoenix,Arizona,

784
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,510
uh,with my husband and
our three daughters.

785
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,010
He's an aerospace engineer.

786
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,510
I work with the District
Attorney's Office.

787
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,580
Wow!

788
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,680
Wow,so we have a...

789
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,180
They love that.

790
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,780
Yeah. Woo!

791
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,610
We have a...

792
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,280
a rocket scientist and a lawyer.

793
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,940
You two sound like
quite the Dynamic Duo.

794
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,840
We try. You try?

795
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,640
Well,let's try to win you some money.

796
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,640
You ready? Yeah.

797
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:36,980
Here we go. Okay.

798
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,310
We've got 26 lovely
ladies holding 26 cases.

799
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,440
Each of them has a random
amount placed in them

800
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,510
by a third party.

801
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,940
We don't know what's in what case,

802
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,610
but we do know,one case is holding

803
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,710
one million dollars.

804
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,780
Woo!

805
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,440
And all I'm going to
ask you to do right now

806
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,810
is pick the one

807
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,380
with one million dollars in it.

808
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,680
That's all you got to do. Okay.

809
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,310
Okay,Allison?

810
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,140
Okay. Got a number in mind?

811
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,980
I'm going to go with case #3.

812
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,340
3. Lisa,open your case.

813
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,340
Woo!

814
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,440
There you go.

815
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,610
Thank you.

816
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,280
Okay.

817
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,480
All right.

818
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,380
So you think there's a
million dollars in this case?

819
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,010
I do. You do?

820
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,980
Well,let's find out.
You know how we do that?

821
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,280
By eliminating those.

822
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,240
Whatever's in those is not in yours.

823
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,810
We're going to start
by opening six cases

824
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,480
before we call our banker.

825
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,510
Pick some cases.

826
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,040
Pick the ones with the small amounts.

827
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,380
Keep the large amounts in play,

828
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,640
and the offers will go up,okay?

829
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:36,710
Okay. Start with the small amounts.

830
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,740
I'm going to go with

831
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,880
case... #9!

832
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,910
#9. Patricia.

833
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,510
Patricia,open the case.

834
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,880
One penny
- smallest amount up there.

835
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,740
Okay. We're off to a good start.

836
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,940
Five more cases.

837
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,580
#15!

838
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,910
15. Brooke.

839
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,110
Brooke,

840
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,240
open the case.

841
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,910
Okay.

842
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,280
A dollar!

843
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,380
You're off to a really good start.

844
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,740
I don't think I've ever
seen anybody do that before.

845
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,040
#10!

846
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:18,410
#10. Okay.

847
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,510
Tania,

848
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,240
open your case.

849
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,080
This is... This is

850
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,280
getting weird.

851
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,940
That is... That is unbelievable.

852
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:34,540
That is unbelievable,Allison
- the three lowest amounts

853
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,980
in a row. What-What do
you... You have x-ray vision?

854
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,880
I don't know what to say.

855
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,380
Uh,I-I'm a good guesser.
I always have been.

856
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,810
Oh,I can see that.

857
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,340
My God,let's keep going.

858
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,610
Okay. All right.

859
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,210
Case #26!

860
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,040
#26.

861
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,440
14!

862
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:54,280
14.

863
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,740
Case #7!

864
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,840
Yes!

865
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,110
Yeah!

866
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,780
I am,uh... I'm speechless.

867
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,980
My hands are actually shaking. They are.

868
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,180
This is,uh... It's amazing.

869
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,310
I'm-I'm sure the banker's
hands are also shaking.

870
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,580
Let's get a call from him

871
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,580
and an offer.

872
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,640
Okay. And see what he's offering.

873
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,810
Call me.

874
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,240
Okay,here we go.

875
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:24,110
Hello?

876
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,740
Okay.

877
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,540
Okay,um...

878
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:38,210
apparently,uh,we need to stop tape.

879
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,610
And...

880
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,810
Excuse me?

881
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,610
Okay. No,I'm sorry,folks.

882
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,380
I'm sorry. We,uh...

883
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,540
This'll just be a minute.

884
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,710
Let's get another contestant,

885
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,010
and we'll,uh... we'll start again.

886
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,180
What's going on?

887
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,880
I don't understand.

888
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,840
I think you know
exactly what's going on.

889
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,780
You are cheating,Mrs. Dubois.

890
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,240
Cheating?

891
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:03,040
The banker knows exactly
what's happening here.

892
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,100
Thought you'd want
one last status report

893
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,530
before you headed home.

894
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,970
It's hard to imagine how
anyone's going to get to her.

895
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,670
I mean,we have her covered
like nobody's business.

896
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,790
And I guess it's
freaking her out a little.

897
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,300
According to my guys,she didn't
even leave the hotel today.

898
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,500
Worked from her room,

899
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,670
and when she did step out
to go to the coffee shop,

900
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,300
they said she didn't look too pleased

901
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,670
about our being in the hallway.

902
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,600
Well,I guess that's the price you pay

903
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,000
to keep your head when everyone
around you is losing theirs.

904
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,830
Hello?

905
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,430
Allison,it's Manuel Devalos.

906
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,730
Where am I catching you?

907
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,200
In the car,headed home.

908
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,830
Is everything all right?

909
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,800
Is there any chance I can
get you to come back here?

910
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,830
There's something I
need to discuss with you.

911
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,330
Something I need to... show you.

912
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,570
Thanks for coming back.

913
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,970
No problem.

914
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,200
I just,uh...

915
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,570
got the damnedest call,

916
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:23,530
the,uh... damnedest fax.

917
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,500
I don't remember if
I mentioned it to you,

918
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,570
but this national reporter,P.D. McCall,

919
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:30,400
has been writing some
pretty nasty pieces about me,

920
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,500
about this Paxton thing.

921
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,330
Got another one coming out on Sunday.

922
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,170
Just faxed me a copy of it.

923
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,930
Wanted to know if I had any comment.

924
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,700
Well,how bad is it?

925
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,770
Pretty tough stuff.

926
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,770
Quotes from an insider

927
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,970
talking about some of the
inner workings of this office.

928
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:48,830
Even talked about some
of the work you do for us.

929
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,130
Me?

930
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,130
He mentions me?

931
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,130
How is that possible?

932
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,600
Where did he get that?

933
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,070
Who would tell him?

934
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,030
Where would something
like that come from?

935
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,270
Well,I read the piece twice.

936
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,500
The only thing that makes any sense...

937
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,530
is it apparently came from you,Allison.

938
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,070
Me?

939
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,870
The District Attorney's Office

940
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,870
seems to be held in a thrall
by a self-professed psychic

941
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:16,430
named Allison Dubois,whose
dreams,vague feelings

942
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,200
and prognostications appear
to have been the primary basis

943
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,670
for Walter Paxton's prosecution. "

944
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,970
I swear,I never...

945
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,270
I would never...

946
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,830
I didn't talk to this person.

947
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,930
I don't even know a P.D. McCall.

948
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,970
I think maybe you do.

949
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,630
But Mrs. Dubois' influence
is not just limited

950
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,470
to the District Attorney's Office.

951
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,030
At one point,she actually
became so convinced

952
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,830
that I would be the Recapitator's

953
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,670
next victim,she
attempted to convince me

954
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,230
to leave town so that
my life would be spared.

955
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,830
When I explained that I couldn't

956
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,100
and wouldn't leave town

957
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,230
without some compelling
evidence beyond her dreams,

958
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,500
she was actually able to
persuade the police department

959
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,230
to redirect its resources
and provide round-the-clock

960
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,270
protection for me. "

961
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,430
No... it can't be.

962
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,000
She wouldn't.

963
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,400
I did some checking.

964
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,830
McCall was her married name.

965
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,270
She's divorced now.

966
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,000
Her maiden name... is Livingston.

967
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,270
Paladin Debra Livingston.

968
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,600
P.D.!

969
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,100
You're not at all who
you say you are,are you?

970
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,200
You didn't hit my car.

971
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,630
You don't sell things for a living.

972
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,800
You don't even go by the name Debra!

973
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,330
Okay,but then,if you
were really the psychic

974
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,330
you claim to be,wouldn't
you have known that?

975
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,170
I can't believe I let
you use me this way.

976
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,400
Please.

977
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,430
You know,at the end of the day,

978
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,730
this really has very
little to do with you.

979
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,500
You just happen to work
for a man who I think-

980
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,230
who a lot of people are starting to think
- is reckless,

981
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,070
foolhardy in the way that he chooses

982
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,670
to handle the people's business.

983
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,230
Believe me,I just took
a shot in the dark.

984
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,330
I had no idea when I
told you I'd hit your car

985
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,630
that you'd end up being
such a rich source.

986
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,670
I was just hoping maybe you'd tell me

987
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,470
he was using the office postage meter

988
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,470
for personal mail.

989
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,600
So,that's all I am,is the source?

990
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,370
Doesn't it matter at all

991
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:21,330
that the man you're trying
to destroy is a great man?

992
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,370
A great lawyer?

993
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,100
A terrific district attorney?

994
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,870
A man who loves this
city and its people?

995
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,070
I'm sure he has a good heart.

996
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,170
You cannot run this story.

997
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:34,230
Debra... please.

998
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,370
I befriended you.

999
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,170
I told you things in confidence.

1000
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,770
Crazy things,Allison.

1001
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,400
Crazy things that people

1002
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,430
who should know better
apparently listen to.

1003
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,070
And that,all by itself-

1004
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,430
that's reason enough
for me to run the story.

1005
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,870
I told you those things
to save your life!

1006
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,470
To get you to hear.

1007
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,900
To get you to listen!

1008
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,330
And what about me?

1009
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,800
<i>What about my life?</i>

1010
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,570
My husband's life?

1011
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,070
My children's lives?

1012
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,370
Are you going to print those secrets,

1013
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:04,400
make it impossible for us to live...?

1014
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,400
Allison,stop.

1015
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,870
You are a lovely person.

1016
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,730
But you are also a menace.

1017
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,400
A
nice,well-meaning,good-natured

1018
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,530
menace,and I like you.

1019
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,700
And I do care about you.

1020
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,800
And it is my deepest wish that someone,

1021
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,530
anyone close to you,find
you the mental health care

1022
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,770
that you so obviously,desperately need.

1023
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,500
McCall here.

1024
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,670
Hello?

1025
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,400
Lee?

1026
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,630
Oh,no.

1027
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,330
Where?

1028
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,430
Monamore Hotel?

1029
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,570
I'm on my way.

1030
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:47,230
Okay.

1031
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,470
Wow. Bad news travels fast.

1032
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,470
Poor woman.

1033
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,500
Victim #4.

1034
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,100
Funny thing,though-

1035
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,270
I thought victim #4
was supposed to be me.

1036
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:05,300
Good-bye,Allison.

1037
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:24,870
