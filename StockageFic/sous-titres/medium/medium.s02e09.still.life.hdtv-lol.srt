1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
Hello. I'm Rod Serling,

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,100
speaking to you this evening from somewhere just beyond the Twilight Zone.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,200
Submitted for your approval or at least your analysis:

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,400
the strange case of you, the viewing audience.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,600
The bizarre events in this evening's episode of Medium

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,000
cannot be confined to two dimensions.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,700
Certain sequences of the story demand to be presented in 3D,

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,200
so keep your glasses close at hand,

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,600
seat yourself approximately six to eight feet from your screen,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,500
and whenever you see the logo in the corner--

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,500
that's it right there-- put your glasses on.

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,500
If you don't have them, don't worry.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,500
You can still enjoy the episode.

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,500
And now hold on.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,300
Our next stop, the Medium Zone.

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,400
I'm not really an art person,

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,300
but ever since I was little girl,

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,700
when I look at a work of art,

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,900
I sense things about the person who made it.

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,700
I think it might be because really gifted people can't help but leave a

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,500
piece of their souls on the canvas.

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,400
Ever wonder why the Mona Lisa is smiling or what's bothering Whistler's mother?

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,600
I really believe if I were ever able to get to Paris

24
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,000
and look at the original paintings,

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,500
I might be able to tell you.

26
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,100
Like this guy here.

27
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,800
Look at his face.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,200
What do you see?

29
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,900
An artistic genius or a jilted lover?

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,800
Creative fulfillment or massive self-loathing?

31
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,200
Simple exhaustion or overwhelming depression?

32
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,200
Vincent Van Gogh fell in love twice in his life,

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,000
but was spurned by both women.

34
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,600
He ended up spending most of his short adult life
in and out of mental institutions,

35
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,200
until at the age of 36,

36
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
after a ten-year frenzy of painting,

37
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,600
he decided to end it all.

38
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,600
Van Gogh committed suicide at the height of his artistic powers.

39
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,100
Tragically, he sold but one canvas during his entire life.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,300
If you like vital programs like the one you just saw,

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,500
we urge you to give and give generously.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,400
Oliver Wendell Holmes was appointed to the Supreme Court by President

43
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Theodore Roosevelt in 1902.

44
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,600
He is one of the most important justices in American history

45
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,000
- and is sometimes called "The Great Dissenter"
- What does that mean?

46
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,400
He was called that because he disagreed so often with the other judges.

47
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,900
His important cases were...

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,300
But I don't understand.

49
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,500
I thought that disagreements were bad.

50
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
Mom...

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,300
Bridgette, Ariel's practicing.

52
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,900
Why don't we listen to what she has to say and we'll ask questions afterwards?

53
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,000
I was listening.

54
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,100
Ooh, look at you.

55
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Wow, Daddy,
you sure look nice.

56
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,300
Did you hear the first part?

57
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,300
I was riveted, and it's the fifth time I've heard it.

58
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,900
Now hang on one sec,

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,300
and I'm coming over to hear the thrilling conclusion.

60
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
You're kidding, right?

61
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,800
Well, it's the law of probabilities.

62
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,300
Every time you wear a tie,

63
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,300
it goes into your coffee or your coffee gets on it.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,100
Come on, this is your one tie.

65
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,800
Your boss asked you out to lunch.

66
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,800
Thought you might want to keep it clean.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,100
I do want to keep it clean,

68
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,800
but if I put this thing under my chin and anyone sees it,

69
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,500
they're going to take away my "man" card,

70
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
and we don't want that.

71
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,600
Ah, suit yourself.

72
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,100
Hello, ladies.

73
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,100
Now, you were saying...?

74
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,500
Daddy.

75
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,200
You still look nice, Daddy.

76
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,200
Okay...

77
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
See what I can do.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,700
Ariel, finish making the lunches!

79
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,900
And, Bridgette, honey, brush your teeth!

80
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,300
Don't waste your time.

81
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,400
That one's had it.

82
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,900
You can't do that.

83
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,500
Yeah, that's one of the best parts of being dead.

84
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,100
Yeah, you just wait till it's your turn.
You'll see.

85
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,500
What are you doing here?

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,600
I'm just visiting my only son and his only wife.

87
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,300
Go figure.

88
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,500
Boy's pushing 40,
and every time he dresses up,

89
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,100
he still fidgets like he's...

90
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,500
he's going out to have his class picture taken.

91
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,300
Forget it, forget it. Just...

92
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,000
get him the one that's in your bottom
drawer that you're saving for Christmas.

93
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,600
What?

94
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,800
What do you want?

95
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
Just concerned about my boy.

96
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,600
Now, we both know that he can't make grown-up decisions.

97
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,200
No, I'm sorry.
I don't know that.

98
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,500
Please...

99
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,100
What? What is your problem?

100
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,100
You had no time for this man when you were alive.

101
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,700
Now you're dead you think you can just

102
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,900
pop in whenever the hell you want
and offer some fatherly advice?!

103
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,900
Leave us alone!

104
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,400
This is my bathroom!

105
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,600
I'd like a little privacy!

106
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,400
I'd like to be able to use the toilet, if you don't mind!

107
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,600
Hey...

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
no problem.

109
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,700
I'll tell him to call back.

110
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,300
Tell who to call back?

111
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,000
Detective Scanlon.

112
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,700
Any luck with that?

113
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,000
No. In my bottom drawer,
there's a new one in a Christmas box.

114
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,500
Really?

115
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
give me the phone.

116
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,100
Thanks. Hello?

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Oh, my God.

118
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,700
Who was it?

119
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,600
I don't know.

120
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,500
They haven't found a body yet.

121
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,500
Doesn't look like you'd have to look very far.

122
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,200
We've been all over the park.

123
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,900
Nothing.

124
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,000
So far, all I've got is what looks like
a couple of quarts of type O-positive

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,600
and a vagrant who claims he heard a man

126
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,500
and a woman arguing in here sometime last night.

127
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,200
I called the morgue.

128
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,400
No John or Jane Does were brought in.

129
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,000
Same deal with the hospitals.

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,900
You okay?

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

132
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,700
Does "Jack's Gal" mean anything?

133
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,600
Hope you brought your appetite.

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,500
Absolutely. It travels with me wherever I go.

135
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,300
So, I'm guessing you know this by heart.

136
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,800
Afraid so. Probably eaten here at least twice a week for the last eight years.

137
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,300
So what do you recommend?
What's good?

138
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,600
Me? I recommend change.

139
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,700
I recommend that nobody eat in the same place twice a week for eight years.

140
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,100
It dulls the palate and mutes the soul.

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,400
I'm leaving Aerodytech, Joe.

142
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm giving my notice at the end of the day.

143
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,900
Okay.

144
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,900
Well, congratulations, I guess.

145
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,000
Our loss is somebody else's gain.

146
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,000
So who poached you?

147
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,200
Was it Grumman? Boeing?

148
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,400
Nobody poached me.

149
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,900
I'm starting my own company.

150
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,700
And the reason I asked you to lunch is,

151
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,600
well... I need a partner.

152
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,000
I've got the financing,

153
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,400
but I need a sounding board,

154
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,100
a confidante,

155
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,400
not to mention a gifted engineer.

156
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,100
Close your mouth, Joe.

157
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,000
You'll draw flies.

158
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,400
What do you do if someone knocks on the door?

159
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,500
I don't open it.

160
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,000
What do you do if you smell smoke?

161
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,700
I dial 911.

162
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,700
And what do you do if I want to watch something and you don't?

163
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,600
I want a regular babysitter.

164
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,500
We don't need a regular babysitter.

165
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,900
I'm old enough to babysit,

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and besides, it's an emergency.

167
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,900
Right, Mom?

168
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,100
Bridgette, honey,

169
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,400
Daddy called at the last minute.

170
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,100
He wants me to meet him for dinner downtown.

171
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,600
There's something very important he wants to talk about.

172
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,900
I don't care!
She's going to be mean to me!

173
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,600
She's not going to be mean to you.
She's your sister.

174
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,400
Now come on.

175
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,900
Mom!

176
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,800
Okay, come on, everybody out.
I'm going to be late.

177
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,500
Let's go.

178
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,900
Come on, out.
Out, out, out, out. Go.

179
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,100
He says he's got to know in three days.

180
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,300
Something about the financing.

181
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,900
Well, what do you think?

182
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,900
What do I think?

183
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,400
I think it's scary and flattering,

184
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,300
and scary and flattering,

185
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,900
and scary and...

186
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,400
The guy's the best combination of businessman and engineer I've ever met.

187
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,800
I keep thinking about all these magazine articles I've read about Wozniak

188
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,800
and Jobs getting together, about...

189
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,500
Bill Gates and Paul Allen.

190
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,800
I keep wondering if this is the beginning of something like that.

191
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,000
And then I keep thinking about the...

192
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
the company health plan,

193
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,900
and my great parking space,

194
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,000
and the company Christmas party--

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,600
the stupid stuff I've come to depend on.

196
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,000
Hey.

197
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,500
No fair. Where'd you go?

198
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,300
What does that say?

199
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,000
What's what say?

200
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Jason Morrow.

201
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,200
Okay, tree with stuff hanging from it.

202
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,000
Nice.

203
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,800
I kind of like this one.

204
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,900
I wonder who she is.

205
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,300
She's so beautiful and her eyes are so sad.

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Her eyes?

207
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Are you okay?

208
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,800
Yeah... I'm fine.

209
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,700
Sorry.

210
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,500
It just looked like...

211
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
Never mind.

212
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,000
You sure?

213
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,500
What time did you tell the kids?

214
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,100
Allison...

215
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,500
Allison.

216
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,800
Allison.

217
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,500
Quite a set of lungs on that one.

218
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,300
Must take after her mother.

219
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,400
Do you mind?

220
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,400
Me? I'm dead. I don't mind much of anything anymore.

221
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,400
Well, I do, so I'd appreciate it if you'd just go away.

222
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,100
I can't go away,

223
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,000
Allie dear.

224
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,200
Not until I've...

225
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,400
I've said my piece.

226
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,400
About what?

227
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,000
My son--

228
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,900
the entrepreneur.

229
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,500
Oh... you know about that, huh?

230
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,800
I know everything.

231
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,800
That's one of the perks of my current condition.

232
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,900
Now, look, far be it from me to stand in the way of my son's dream.

233
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,200
But trust me when I say that this new business venture

234
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
is not the right way for him to go.

235
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,800
And why would I do that?

236
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,000
Trust you, I mean.

237
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,200
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

238
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,000
It means you never once supported any of Joe's decisions.

239
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,400
Even when you were alive.

240
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,700
I let him marry you, didn't I?

241
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,900
Fine, be that way.

242
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:40,200
Just make sure that Joe knows that Versailles's running on fumes.

243
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,500
What?

244
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,800
Just tell him that.

245
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Versailles's running on fumes.

246
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,700
He needs to hear that.

247
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,400
It's important.

248
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,900
Thought you might want to know we got a positive ID on the owner of that

249
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,600
blood we found in the park yesterday.

250
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,800
Gloria Soto.

251
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,400
Mexican citizen,

252
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,800
but a frequent border-hopper.

253
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,300
That's how we had her DNA on file.

254
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,300
She was brought in on a solicitation charge in El Paso.

255
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,300
So that explains what she was doing in the park.

256
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,300
What?

257
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,900
I've seen this woman before.

258
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,000
Last night, actually.

259
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,700
What do you mean?

260
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,100
Like in a dream?

261
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,200
It was in a gallery.

262
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,400
I was at this art gallery and this local artist,

263
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,700
Jason Morrow--

264
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,600
I saw this woman in one of his paintings.

265
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,000
You sure it was her?

266
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,000
Can you take me there, to that gallery?

267
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,100
I don't think it'll help.

268
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,100
The painting in the gallery is of the back of her head.

269
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,600
Then how do you know it's Gloria Soto?

270
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,100
Because...

271
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,800
she turned and looked at me.

272
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,800
Hello?

273
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,000
Jason?

274
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,900
Jason Morrow?

275
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,800
Detective Scanlon.

276
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,500
This is Allison Dubois with the District Attorney's office.

277
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,300
We're, uh...

278
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,000
we're working a missing persons case and your name came up during the

279
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,100
course of our investigation.

280
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,200
That sounds ominous.

281
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,100
Who's gone missing?

282
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,300
Gloria Soto.

283
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,700
She's a Mexican, 34 years of age.

284
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,300
Very pretty.

285
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,700
I'm sorry, I don't know that name.

286
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,700
Maybe you'll know the face.

287
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,900
No. I've never actually seen this woman before.

288
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,000
Wait a second. Are you telling me
that she never posed for you?

289
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,000
That's right.

290
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
I don't use models.

291
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,500
Actually, Gloria was a prostitute.

292
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,500
I don't use those either.

293
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,200
But if you could tell me how my name came up,

294
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,800
perhaps I could be of a little more help.

295
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,600
Allison...

296
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,000
Allison, you okay?

297
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,400
Yeah, I-I'm fine.

298
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,500
Could... could I trouble you for a glass of water?

299
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,900
In that back room over there.

300
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,200
What are you doing?

301
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,200
It's not just me, right?

302
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,300
You see her face, too?

303
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,100
Plain as day.

304
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,100
Want to tell me again, Mr. Morrow,

305
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,600
how you never met Gloria Soto?

306
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,000
Good morning.

307
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,300
Good morning.

308
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,400
Um, if I could just have a word.

309
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,200
Excuse us.

310
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,400
Sorry. I'm sorry.

311
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,500
That's my office.

312
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,900
I know, I know,

313
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,900
and honestly, we've been in there all of three minutes.

314
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,900
He insisted.

315
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,900
And he is?

316
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,800
David Morrow--

317
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,200
worth conservatively a quarter of a billion dollars.

318
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,500
Or at least his late wife was.

319
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,200
Okay.

320
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,300
And late last night,

321
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,700
apparently on your say-so,

322
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,500
his son was ordered held in connection with some missing persons case.

323
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,300
So he called his good friend the mayor,

324
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,300
who called you...

325
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,300
At 3:30 this morning...

326
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,700
And told you to get down here and convince me to let him go.

327
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,400
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint His Honor,

328
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,800
but as he very well knows,

329
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,600
I can hold a suspect, any suspect,

330
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,000
rich, poor or otherwise,

331
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,200
without actually charging him for 24 hours.

332
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,000
No, he knows that.

333
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,100
It's just-- since there's no firm evidence to actually implicate this man,

334
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,700
we were wondering if you could possibly see your way clear...

335
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,600
No, I can't.

336
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,500
And you tell the mayor I have a bathroom full of blood and a team of

337
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,100
professional investigators telling me that Jason Morrow is connected.

338
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,300
That's enough for me,

339
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,600
and it should be enough for the mayor.

340
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,700
Mr. District Attorney,

341
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,600
David Morrow.

342
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,400
Mr. Morrow.

343
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,100
I couldn't help but overhear the tail end of that exchange.

344
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,700
Look, just so everyone's intentions are clear--

345
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,600
when this evening rolls around,

346
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,500
if you still don't have enough evidence to charge my son,

347
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,400
I will be filing a lawsuit against you and
the City of Phoenix for wrongful arrest.

348
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,200
You thank the mayor for his help.

349
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,200
I'll see myself out.

350
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,300
It's not here.

351
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,000
I'll get it.

352
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,400
Hello.

353
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,800
Oh, good morning, sir.

354
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,400
You did?

355
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Well, I'm sorry. I lost it.

356
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,800
I found it!

357
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,300
Joe found it.

358
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
It's Devalos. He was trying
to call me on my cell phone.

359
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,200
Yeah, I can be there at 10:30.

360
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,000
Fine.

361
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,800
Thank you.

362
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,300
Thank you.

363
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,100
Look at you.

364
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,600
You're as nervous as a cat.

365
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,000
I-I haven't been to a lawyer since we bought this house.

366
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,700
You have your little list of questions?

367
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,000
Do I ever.

368
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,700
I got my health insurance packet,

369
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,600
Aerodytech contract,

370
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,300
my pension fund statements.

371
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,400
You know,
the irony is I'm going to spend the whole day with this guy,

372
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,200
and then when it's over,

373
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,800
I'm still not going to know whether to do it or not.

374
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,300
I'm sorry, honey,

375
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,400
I wish I had an answer.

376
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,500
What good are you?

377
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,200
I'll show you what good I am.

378
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,700
Does the name "Versailles" mean anything to you?

379
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,400
Used to be a big fancy building in France.

380
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,700
Why?

381
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,000
Well, your father showed up again here last night.

382
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,900
And he told me you shouldn't go into business with Andrew because...

383
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Wait, I want to get this right...

384
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,800
"Versailles is running on fumes.

385
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,300
" "Versailles is running on fumes?" It was the middle of the night,

386
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,600
and it was your father.

387
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,400
He told me you needed to hear that.

388
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,900
Thanks, Dad.

389
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,400
I'll be sure and tell that to the lawyer.

390
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,700
Do I look okay?

391
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,200
I'm paying this guy $250 an hour,

392
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,500
and I'm worried about what I look like.

393
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,300
You look like a captain of industry.

394
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,200
You look like an admiral of industry.

395
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,400
Admiral's bigger than captain, right?

396
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,400
I have no idea.

397
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,100
I got to go.

398
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,000
I understand, Judge,

399
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,600
but I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you I think you're making a mistake.

400
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,700
Jason Morrow is our only connection to this missing woman.

401
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,100
Respectfully, I disagree...

402
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,300
We will work harder, sir.

403
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,100
You count on it.

404
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,800
No warrant.

405
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,600
The judge seems to feel that we're reaching.

406
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,200
So, I guess Jason Morrow's car, home, studio--

407
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,100
they're all off limits?

408
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,200
Well, we can still hold him for another 10 hours,

409
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,000
but unless we have any physical evidence that he was involved in the

410
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,300
disappearance of Gloria Soto, he'll walk.

411
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,000
I wish I could tell you that I had a dream last night that would narrow

412
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,200
down the search for the body.

413
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,400
But so far I've only been able to see things
when I look at one of Morrow's paintings.

414
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,300
Well, in that case,

415
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,900
I think you'll appreciate the homework
we've assembled for you in the conference room.

416
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,400
47 paintings in total,

417
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,200
every one of them a Jason Morrow original.

418
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,300
Figure it'll keep you busy for the rest of the morning.

419
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,400
Wait, I thought that we couldn't get a search warrant on his studio?

420
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,100
We couldn't.

421
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,100
I spent most of last night visiting all the local galleries,

422
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,300
flashing my badge and asking if the Phoenix P.D.

423
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,300
could "borrow" everything they had by Jason Morrow.

424
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,300
Just watch where you put that coffee;

425
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,100
we break anything,

426
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,900
we pay for it.

427
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,000
Give us a call if you see something.

428
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Where are you going?

429
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,500
I'm going to go look for a tree with
a hundred pairs of sneakers dangling from it.

430
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:31,800
"Self Portrait." Jason, it doesn't look a thing like you.

431
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,400
Good-bye, my darling.

432
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:32,900
Hello?

433
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,100
How much you know about local high school football?

434
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,700
Not much. Why?

435
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,600
It turns out the Flagstaff Cougars have this funny little tradition.

436
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,100
Every year the graduating seniors tie their cleats together and throw them

437
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,300
over the branches of a dead ash tree
near their favorite drinking spot in the woods.

438
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,000
If I give you directions,
how soon can you be here?

439
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,400
One adult female, one male child.

440
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,300
Forensic techs figure they've been here at least 20 years.

441
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,400
Which means she couldn't possibly be Gloria Soto.

442
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,400
And unless Jason Morrow was one very advanced toddler...

443
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,600
I'm guessing he's not our killer.

444
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,300
We're 20 hours into the custody of Jason Morrow,

445
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,700
and we're still no closer to finding the body of Gloria Soto.

446
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,000
We have, however,

447
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,900
found two bodies that we weren't looking for,

448
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,500
but we can be reasonably certain that
our suspect had nothing to do with their deaths,

449
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,200
given the fact that he was a toddler at the time.

450
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,100
I don't know what to tell you.

451
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,500
All I can say is, I saw
Gloria Soto being buried in that grave.

452
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
No, you didn't.

453
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,200
You saw her mother, Inez Soto.

454
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,700
We I.D.'d her off her dental records.

455
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,000
They matched a missing persons report her family filed in Mexico in 1982.

456
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,100
1982?

457
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,900
Apparently,

458
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,000
the Mexican authorities forwarded it to us at the time.

459
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,500
Someone spent about a half a day looking into it,

460
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,400
and then it sat in a drawer until this afternoon.

461
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,100
Oh, my God, she looks exactly like her daughter.

462
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,700
I thought I saw someone digging a grave for Gloria,

463
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,200
but I must've seen someone digging a grave for her mother.

464
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,600
Now, here's an interesting factoid--

465
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,900
care to guess who Inez was working for when she disappeared in '82?

466
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,000
According to the file--

467
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,100
David Morrow.

468
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,800
Wait a second,

469
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,500
the woman whose corpse you just found worked for Jason Morrow's father?

470
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,100
According to her family, she was working for him as a maid,

471
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,400
making money to send back home to Mexico to her daughter.

472
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,900
Had a son, too. Tomas.

473
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
He was born here in the States.

474
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,400
Disappeared when she did.

475
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,500
That must've been the boy,

476
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,200
the same one I saw in Jason's paintings.

477
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,800
I have...

478
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,900
a present for you,

479
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
by the way.

480
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,600
A little something, to, uh,

481
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,500
complete your collection.

482
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,800
Where did this come from?

483
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,500
Stopped by to see Jason Morrow in his holding cell to see if his plush

484
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,600
surroundings triggered any new recollections about Gloria Soto.

485
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,600
He was working on it the whole time I was there--

486
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,800
I asked him if I could see it.

487
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,700
He told me to keep it.

488
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,100
Good-bye, my darling.

489
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,200
Feel better, little baby.

490
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,300
There were two little babies--

491
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,200
there had to be.

492
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,800
There was Inez's son,

493
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,100
and there was Jason.

494
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,400
Jason was a witness.

495
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,900
He doesn't remember anything;

496
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,700
he was too young.

497
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,900
But it's all in there.

498
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,300
Every time I see one of his paintings come to life,

499
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,700
I'm seeing what happened through his eyes.

500
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,300
I-I'm sorry, I'm not sure I follow you.

501
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,300
Well, think about it.

502
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,100
He couldn't have killed the mother and son.

503
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,700
But he could have seen his father do it.

504
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,800
Look, I think what happened to Inez and her son is terrible.

505
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,800
From what little I remember of them, they were nice people.

506
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,000
But if you're suggesting that I had anything to do with their deaths...

507
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,700
We just wanted to ask you a few questions.

508
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,500
Well, considering the fact
that you just released my son

509
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,800
after incarcerating him for 24 hours,

510
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,400
you'll forgive me if I'm not feeling especially cooperative.

511
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,600
You ever been convicted of a felony, Mr. Morrow?

512
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,200
Yes, I was arrested several times,

513
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,000
but I'm guessing that you already know that.

514
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,700
Heroin possession, right?

515
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,100
It happened over 20 years ago, Detective.

516
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,500
A youthful indiscretion.

517
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,900
More like three youthful indiscretions, actually.

518
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,500
What about assault and battery charges your wife filed?

519
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,000
Emily dropped those charges.

520
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,400
It was a misunderstanding.

521
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,300
Now, are you finished,

522
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,600
or do I need to call my lawyer?

523
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,800
No, no.

524
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,300
I've only got one more question for you.

525
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,200
Why'd you kill Inez and her kid?

526
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,200
She hear something she shouldn't have?

527
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,700
Try to blackmail you, maybe?

528
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,500
That's your theory?

529
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,600
I killed her to protect my money.

530
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,800
That's a good theory, it's clever,
except for one thing.

531
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,500
Everything you see here,

532
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,000
none of it belongs to me.

533
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It never has.

534
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,900
My wife's family didn't particularly like me,

535
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,900
and I'm guessing that had something to do with the arrest that you mentioned.

536
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,900
While my wife was alive,

537
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,600
we lived off of her trust fund,

538
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,400
and after my wife passed,

539
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,300
all of the assets were transferred to my son Jason. Okay?

540
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,200
This house is his.
Everything.

541
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,500
He lets me live here.

542
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,400
He gives me...

543
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,400
an allowance,

544
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
I guess you could call it.

545
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,100
Okay.

546
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,800
Maybe you two had an affair.

547
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,900
She called it off...

548
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Detective,

549
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,100
you're embarrassing yourself.

550
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I told you not to play with that boy!

551
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,300
He can make you sick.

552
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,700
He can kill you.

553
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,900
Now, tilt your head back.

554
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,000
Dr. Tedesco said we have to be sure to get every drop of blood off you.

555
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,100
Keep your eyes open.

556
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,500
...guess we'll be giving you a call, and, uh,

557
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,400
you can come down to the station to make a statement.

558
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,000
That was productive.

559
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,000
Actually, it was.

560
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
You saw something in there?

561
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,000
I saw Inez Soto again when I was looking at that painting.

562
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,600
She was giving one of the boys a bath.

563
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,200
Sounds like a hot lead--

564
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,600
I mean, she was the maid.

565
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,600
No, it wasn't like that--

566
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,700
she was scared of something.

567
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,900
She mentioned the other boy,

568
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,900
she said he was sick.

569
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,800
And she mentioned a doctor.

570
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,800
Tedesco. Dr. Tedesco.

571
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,900
It seemed important.

572
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,000
A name-- now,

573
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,100
that I can work with.

574
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,200
Oh.

575
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,100
Hmm.

576
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,900
Mm!

577
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,300
After a long day of hard work,

578
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,000
I really look forward to a brewski.

579
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,700
Hmm, well, then, my dear,

580
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,600
you are doomed for an evening of disappointment.

581
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,900
A man-- a man with a mask--

582
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,400
came into our house and stole all of our brewskis.

583
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,400
Mm.

584
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,100
So I'm sitting in our $250-

585
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:30,500
an-hour lawyer's office and I think it's hour three and he says to me,

586
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,100
"Is it true the fellows from Versailles Capital are funding you and Andrew?

587
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,500
" And all I could think of is...

588
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,300
"Versailles is running on fumes."

589
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,100
And I was, like, "I don't know".
I mean, I do know.

590
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,300
At least I strongly suspect based on our conversation this morning.

591
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,400
But I don't know.

592
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,400
So what do you do?

593
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,300
I pretended my phone was vibrating,

594
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,800
that it was a call from you.

595
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,100
I told him I had to wrap up this meeting and I got out of there and I went

596
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,200
over to Andrew's house,

597
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,400
and I just asked him.

598
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,100
And?

599
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,800
And he said, "Keep it under your hat, Joe, but yes,

600
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,300
"Versailles Capital has agreed to provide 100 percent "

601
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,500
of the startup funding for Gossamer.

602
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,300
That's the name we came up with-- Gossamer."

603
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,200
That's a great name.

604
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,700
That's a beautiful name,

605
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,500
my emperor of industry.

606
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,600
So what are you going to do?

607
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,800
I already did it.

608
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,200
I told him I couldn't join him.

609
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,000
Told him I wouldn't.

610
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,800
Did you tell him why?

611
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,700
Did I tell him my dead father told me the money's not going to come through?

612
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
No, I didn't.

613
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,000
I don't know why.
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

614
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,800
But, Joe, maybe you could find somebody else to fund you guys.

615
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,500
Maybe... but I already told him.

616
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,300
I'm sure he's out to somebody else by now.

617
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,900
I'm so sorry.

618
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,300
I would've missed the Christmas party.

619
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,000
And my great parking space.

620
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,900
Mm-mm-hmm.

621
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,100
And we do have a hell of a health plan.

622
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,900
You're a liar.

623
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,100
I should get that.
The girls...

624
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,600
Oh! Wait, you just sit. I'll get it.

625
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,200
Hello?

626
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,200
Tracked down this guy Tedesco.

627
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,900
Turns out he's an immunologist,

628
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,500
one of the first pediatric AIDS specialists in Phoenix.

629
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,200
I... I don't understand.

630
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,100
Was Inez's son sick?

631
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,400
D-Did he remember him?

632
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,500
He doesn't remember anything.

633
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,600
He passed away in '86,

634
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,200
but his wife still has all his old medical files in the garage,

635
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,200
and I badgered her and she let me take a look.

636
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,300
And?

637
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,700
And he never treated Tomas,

638
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,300
but get this.

639
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,600
He did treat Jason Morrow.

640
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,500
Turns out Jason's parents were both intravenous drug users,

641
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,200
but only mom got sick.

642
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,200
Apparently she passed AIDS to him in the womb.

643
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,000
According to the file,

644
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,400
Jason's case was terminal.

645
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,200
Life expectancy,

646
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,400
four years, max.

647
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,100
Wait a second, how is that possible?

648
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
Jason's got to be at least 25.

649
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,300
Actually, no.

650
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,600
He's not. He's dead.

651
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,500
You led us to his body.

652
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,400
Oh, my God, that little boy in the grave.

653
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,700
Wasn't Inez Soto's son.

654
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,200
Tomas Soto's still alive,

655
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,900
only he thinks he's Jason Morrow.

656
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,900
Mr. Morrow, thank you for coming in on a Saturday, sir.

657
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,200
I'm only here because my son asked me to come down and join him.

658
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,600
He's waiting in the conference room.
Right this way.

659
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,300
Jason.

660
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,700
You all right?

661
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,800
I'm fine.

662
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,500
Why did they bring you down here?

663
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
To formally apologize.

664
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,200
Jason,

665
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,900
the city of Phoenix sincerely regrets holding you in connection with the

666
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,100
disappearance of Gloria Soto.

667
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:05,100
We recognize it as an ordeal and a massive inconvenience and for that,

668
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,100
we sincerely apologize.

669
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,900
Fine. That's a start.

670
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,700
But if you think it's going to make us stop our lawsuit,

671
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,900
you're wrong.

672
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,900
I can assure you,

673
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,700
I'm under no such misapprehension.

674
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,400
Good. Then we'll see you in court.

675
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,900
Probably sooner than you think.

676
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,300
What's this?

677
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,800
It's a medical report on Jason Morrow.

678
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,900
Your son. It dates back to 1982.

679
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,300
You got this from Dr. Michael Tedesco?

680
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
His widow, actually.

681
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,100
Imagine Jason's surprise when he heard
that he'd been diagnosed with AIDS at birth.

682
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,300
Seems like the type of thing you'd mention... Dad.

683
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,100
I don't know where you're going with this, Manuel,

684
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,000
but you know damn well that file is protected
under doctor-patient confidentiality.

685
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,000
Absolutely.

686
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,700
But since Jason here is supposedly the patient,

687
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,600
he found the contents fascinating.

688
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,600
I never told you because it wasn't true.

689
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,300
I mean, I fired this doctor.

690
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,200
He misdiagnosed you.

691
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,900
I mean, obviously, look at you, you're fine.

692
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,000
So what was wrong with me?

693
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,900
You suffered from a rare form of pediatric pneumonia.

694
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,600
I took you to a clinic in Switzerland.

695
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
You recovered.

696
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,600
And you have documentation to prove that?

697
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,600
My client is not obliged to produce medical records of any kind.

698
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,700
It was very important to you that Jason stay alive,

699
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,400
wasn't it?

700
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,900
Of course. He's my son.

701
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,600
Right.

702
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,100
And after your wife, Emily, passed,

703
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,800
if Jason hadn't survived his bout of-- what'd you callit, "pneumonia"--

704
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,100
you would have been cut out of the family money, wouldn't you?

705
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,400
Mr. District Attorney,

706
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,100
I demand to know,

707
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,000
are you accusing my client of something here?

708
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,300
Only murder.

709
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,000
Two counts for now.

710
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,000
Probably three when all is said and done.

711
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,800
This meeting is over.

712
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,400
Jason.

713
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,500
Sit down, Dad.

714
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,100
Jason, I don't know what they've been telling you,

715
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,600
but it's not true.

716
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,200
David, we should go.

717
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,000
Your wife died of AIDS in 1982.

718
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,800
You knew your son didn't have long to live,

719
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,900
and you knew that when he died,

720
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
your last connection to your wife's family money would die with him.

721
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,800
So you did the only thing you could do.

722
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,200
You went looking for a replacement.

723
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,300
And luckily you didn't have to look far.

724
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,400
Your maid's son was about the same age as Jason.

725
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,400
She was an undocumented immigrant,

726
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,400
somebody you thought nobody would miss.

727
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,400
So you killed her.

728
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,400
And then you did something unthinkable.

729
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,300
You killed your own diseased child,

730
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,300
and you raised Inez Soto's healthy boy as your own.

731
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,800
Jason...

732
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,300
none of this is true.

733
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,000
Well, there's a simple way to prove that.

734
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,300
Jason has agreed to give us a blood sample.

735
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,600
If you're willing to do the same,

736
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,200
and the DNA indicates that the two of you are, in fact, related,

737
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,100
then we'll know that all of this was just
a product of our overactive imaginations.

738
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,100
Come on, Dad.

739
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,700
Doesn't even hurt.

740
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,100
At the end of the day,

741
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,200
we can show them how wrong they are.

742
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,100
Manuel,

743
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,400
you know you cannot compel my client to give you a DNA sample.

744
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,300
You're right.

745
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,600
But I can compare the sample I already drew
from Jason to the DNA from Inez Soto's remains.

746
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,600
In fact, it's being done right now.

747
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,100
And if the comparison shows me what I think it's going to--

748
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,300
that the man raised as Jason Morrow is in fact Tomas Soto--

749
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,100
then I'll have more than enough to make a case against your client.

750
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,800
You're welcome to go somewhere and wait it out if you want,

751
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,000
but I'll be on your ass the whole time.

752
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,000
Or we can stay right here and talk about a deal.

753
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,700
Who knows, you tell me where Gloria Soto's body is,

754
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,000
I'll even consider taking the death penalty off the table.

755
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,800
My card's higher.

756
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,200
You sure?

757
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,800
I'm this sure.

758
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,600
I call.

759
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,600
I win!

760
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,300
No, you don't.

761
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,300
I have an ace.

762
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,000
You have a one.

763
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,100
Daddy,

764
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,000
doesn't four beat one?

765
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,400
Sorry, kiddo. Ace beats all.

766
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,300
Ha!

767
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,400
Hey, nobody told me we were having a barbecue.

768
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,300
Hey.

769
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,600
How'd it go?

770
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,600
Well, the father confessed to everything.

771
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,700
He even told us where he buried Gloria Soto.

772
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,300
Congratulations.

773
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,300
Oh, I guess there's good news all around.

774
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,700
I had an interesting call.

775
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,500
It seems they're having a hard time filling Andrew's position,

776
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,400
and guess what?

777
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,300
They want me to interview for the job.

778
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,400
Way to go, Emperor!

779
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,500
I'm going to go change; I'll be right back.

780
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,200
Hey! Hey!

781
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,300
See? Everything works out for the best.

782
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,700
Apparently.

783
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,600
Thanks, I guess.

784
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,500
Ah, one thing, though.

785
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,800
Um, that firm of theirs, that Gossamer thing?

786
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,300
It's actually going to be a success.

787
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,400
It's actually going to do all right.

788
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
Not, not huge,

789
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,200
but... all right.

790
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,400
What? I don't understand.

791
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,900
Well, I just didn't want you to see it happen later and get angry with me.

792
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,100
I mean, like I said, everything works out for the best.

793
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,700
Well, wait a second.

794
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,500
Now I'm not so sure it has.

795
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,600
Trust me. If he took that partnership,

796
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,400
he'd spend the next 12 years working 70-hour weeks.

797
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,500
And he'd have told himself that he was doing it for you,

798
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,700
for the kids.

799
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,100
And he wouldn't have known that he was losing you guys until it was too late.

800
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,500
Are you crazy? Lose us?

801
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,500
Joe could never lose us.

802
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Uh, not all at once.

803
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
It happens gradually.

804
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,900
Late night by late night,

805
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,100
weekend by weekend.

806
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,700
Before you know it,

807
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,200
you miss a birthday,

808
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,200
then an anniversary.

809
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,100
And then one day your kid is packing up to go to off to college,

810
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,000
and you realize you're saying good-bye to a stranger.

811
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,800
So you thought Joe was going to turn into you?

812
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,800
I knew he was. I saw it.

813
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,700
No, you're wrong.

814
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,900
It wouldn't have happened that way.

815
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,100
Joe is not like you.

816
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,200
And I don't care.

817
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,300
Joe and I are grownups.

818
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,000
We have the right to know the truth.

819
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,200
That was our risk to take.

820
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,200
I don't know. It's 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon.

821
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,500
You're home. He's home.

822
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,900
The burgers are almost ready.

823
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,700
And your little girls have cards stuck to their foreheads.

824
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,500
Days like this-- why would you risk them for anything?

825
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,300
