1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,900
Let's go, you guys.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,000
It's time to get up.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,000
Is my nose playing tricks on me, or is somebody making bacon?

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,200
Someone's trying.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,600
I had the most amazing night's sleep last night.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,400
No bad dreams, no ghosts, no gorgeous.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,900
Just sweet lights out, dead-to-the-world unconsciousness.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,000
I guess one night a year's not so bad.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,300
Hey, you feeling okay?
You sound a little bit stuffed up.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,500
Feel much better now, thank you very much.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,608
Al, what's wrong?

12
00:00:45,308 --> 00:00:46,007
Who are you?

13
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:49,006
What?

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,400
Who are you?! Where's my husband?!

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,600
Your husband is standing right in front of you

16
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,500
trying to figure out what the hell has gotten into is wife.

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,500
Girls, come out here right now!

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,400
What's wrong, Mommy?

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,300
Mom, are you okay?

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,300
Mom, are you okay?

21
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,300
Hey, Al. Hey, can you hear me?

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,600
Al? Al?

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
What happened?

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,000
We were in the kitchen and we heard a crash.

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,900
You slipped on the tile and you knocked yourself out for a second.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,900
Are you okay?

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,500
Yeah.

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,600
I'm just really glad to see you guys.

29
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,500
No, she isn't bleeding, but she's got a lump 
the size of an egg on the back of her head.

30
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,800
Yeah, I understand that.

31
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,600
But what is the point of taking 
her to a primary care physician

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,600
when I know he's just going 
to tell her to get an MRI?

33
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,400
Can't we just cut to the
 chase and spare her a trip?

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,500
Okay, what will our plan pay for?

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,400
Did you see any stars?

36
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,800
No, sweetie.

37
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,800
What about planets or birds?

38
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,000
Like birds flying in a circle?

39
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,000
That's only in cartoons.

40
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,800
So, that doesn't mean that it doesn't really happen in real life.

41
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
Actually, it does.

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,900
Girls, please, I've got a bit of a headache.

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,200
Man, please don't transfer me to Member Services.

44
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,500
They're the ones who transferred me to you.

45
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm sorry. Can you hold on just one second?
I got another call coming through.

46
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,900
- Hello. Chan, this really isn't a good time.
- Do you remember your name?

47
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,200
Of course, she remembers her name.
Why wouldn't she?

48
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,700
Well, sometimes when people get
 hit in the head, they forget stuff.

49
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,900
Thanks.

50
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,500
Where'd you learn that, cartoons?

51
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,000
My name's Allison Dubois.

52
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,200
What's my name?

53
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,300
You are Bridgette.

54
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,600
And where do we live?

55
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,600
We live in Phoenix, Arizona, and Bridg, 
I really don't want...

56
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,800
And where were you born?

57
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,300
What?

58
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,900
Where... were...

59
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,500
you... born?

60
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,900
You do remember it, don't you, Mom?

61
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,800
Of course, I remember.

62
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Mommy can't remember where she was born!

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,800
Okay, you hear that?

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,600
My wife can't remember where 
she was born. She needs an MRI.

65
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,700
That's the other line again.
 Just, just let me get rid of it.

66
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,100
Hello. Chan, I told you check the top drawer.

67
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,100
Then check all the drawers.

68
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,700
Chan, I'm in the middle of something right now.

69
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,800
My wife fell and she hit her head 
and now these clowns at our HMO

70
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,400
are telling us that we can't get an MRI till...

71
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,400
Yeah, no. I know. I know your wife's a doctor.

72
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
Really? She would do that? Are you sure?

73
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,600
That would be fantastic. What's the address?

74
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,100
I don't understand. This isn't a hospital.

75
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
No, it's a private imaging center.

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,900
They'll scan anyone or anything
 as long as you pay for it.

77
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,600
Wait a second.

78
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,600
Are we willing to pay for it?

79
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Chan from my design group, his wife works here.

80
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,100
She's a doctor. She owns a piece of the place.

81
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,300
She's doing us a favor.

82
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,700
That's nice, but I'm not sure how I feel about that.

83
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,300
It's okay. People have MRIs all the time.

84
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,300
There's nothing to it.

85
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,400
Have you ever had one?

86
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,400
I've read about it.

87
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,400
They're completely harmless.

88
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,600
Fine. You go first.

89
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,200
Hey, listen, Chan's wife has been
 really nicefitting us inlike this.

90
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,400
I know.

91
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,100
I'm going to check in with 
the office. I'll be right back.

92
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Your husband's right.
There's nothing to be nervous about.

93
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,400
How do you know?

94
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm a regular. I'm in here all the time.

95
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,600
I have a season pass.

96
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,300
They can never get enough 
pictures of my friend up there.

97
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

98
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
I'm not going to lie to you.

99
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,000
Holding perfectly still inside a steel 
tube can be a little claustrophobic.

100
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
I'll tell you what I do.

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,300
The machine makes this kind 
of loud clanging sound.

102
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,300
I  just kind of close my eyes 
and pretend I'm on a train.

103
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,600
Clang, clang, clang.

104
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,500
I'm just on a train going somewhere exotic.

105
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,700
I don't know. It works for me.

106
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,600
Thank you. I appreciate the tip.

107
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,900
David Saunders?

108
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Guilty  as charged.

109
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,100
Nice meeting you.

110
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,000
You, too.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Feel free to watch if you think it will help.

112
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,500
Excuse me?

113
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,900
From  the observation room. I don't mind.

114
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,100
Oh, yeah, well, maybe.

115
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,200
You'll see. There's nothing to it.

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,800
It's okay, right?

117
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,700
It's fine with me if it's okay with Dr. Sooran.

118
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,000
Maybe we could ask her.
Our husbands work together.

119
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,900
Just give me a minute to change
 into the highly flattering gown.

120
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,700
Did I miss something?

121
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,700
That guy said that I could go
 and watch him get his MRI.

122
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,400
Cool. An all-access pass 
to a stranger's brain scan.

123
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,300
Excellent.

124
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,600
See that? You don't even 
have to scooch in.

125
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,300
It's automatic scooching.

126
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,400
That sound, that sounds like a parade.

127
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,500
No, I don't think so.

128
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,000
I think it sounds like a... train.

129
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,600
Hey, lover boy, you lonely?

130
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,600
Yes, I am... Jade.

131
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,700
Can I offer you a ride?

132
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,000
Sure.

133
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,500
So, where we going, baby?

134
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,700
My house for the weekend.

135
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,200
Oh, I don't know.
The whole weekend?

136
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,000
What about my other boyfriends,baby?

137
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,900
I'm sorry, that was mean.

138
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,500
I don't have other boyfriends.

139
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,500
So where's your house, baby?

140
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,300
What's that?

141
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,200
The train.

142
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,900
We're a block away.

143
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,400
Wow, baby, that was amazing, baby, mmm.

144
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,308
Hey, honey...

145
00:10:03,408 --> 00:10:04,807
would you like me to touch you now?

146
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:07,506
Want me to scratch your back?

147
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,800
I give a great massage.

148
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,600
Maybe I could wash you.

149
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,700
If you untie me...

150
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,100
We can take a bath.

151
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,700
Please, baby?

152
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,700
It's starting to hurt.

153
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,800
Shh...

154
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Do you like the desert? 

155
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,800
What are you doing?

156
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,600
Have you seen enough?

157
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,900
Huh, honey? You seen enough?

158
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:44,900
Yeah.

159
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,100
Yeah, I've seen plenty.

160
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,000
David Saunders, 
white, mid-30s, five ten-ish.

161
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,200
I think I counted five girls,

162
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,500
but he only referred to one of them by name.

163
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,900
Um, Jade.

164
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,800
Although I'm guessing 
that's not a real name anyway.

165
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,600
She has light hair, light eyes.

166
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,500
That's me. Needles-in-a-Haystack-R-Us.

167
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,400
I got to go. My husband's 
giving me the evil eye,

168
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,300
and my doctor'll be in any second.

169
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,500
Detective Scanlon says hi.

170
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,800
Joe says hi, too.

171
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,000
All right, I'll talk to you later.

172
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,800
You know, two hours ago, you couldn't 
remember where you were born,

173
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,200
and now you're phoning the police, 
asking them to start investigating

174
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,700
a man you spent all of three minutes with.

175
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,000
Am I the only one who 
sees a contradiction here?

176
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,500
Mr. and Mrs. Dubois,
so sorry to have kept you waiting.

177
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
No, we're just happy
 that you could fit us in.

178
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,300
Uh, besides, we were enjoying the music.

179
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
Yes, the walls in this place are pretty thin.

180
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,300
It make it hard to concentrate.

181
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,600
It's sort of like living near an airport...
after a while you stop noticing the planes.

182
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,200
Well, I'm happ report, the MRI shows 
no structural damage whatsoever.

183
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,800
I know you mentioned experiencing 
some dizziness fofulness.

184
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Both symptoms should be entirely transitory.

185
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,200
So I can go back to using the
 bathroom without fear of a relapse?

186
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,000
Absolutly.

187
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
I'd take it easy for the rest of the day,
 but yes, by tomorrow,

188
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,300
you can do pretty much anything you like.

189
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,200
You hear that? 
I'm okay; you're stuck with me.

190
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,000
I was afraid she'd broken her funny bone.

191
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,900
Before you go, there's one 
small thing I wanted to ask about.

192
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,900
Of course.

193
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,400
I notice on your patient history form
 that you didn't check the box for epilepsy.

194
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,600
Well, I'm not epileptic.

195
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,700
Then you've never had any lems with seizures?

196
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,300
No, never.Why would you ask ?

197
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,100
You see this gray spot here,looks a little like a peanut?

198
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,200
It's called venous angioma.

199
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,100
Sounds scarier than it really is.

200
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,200
It's actually just a small tangle 
of exveins in one part of the brain.

201
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,900
How long do you suppose that was there?

202
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,300
Probably since birth.

203
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Typically they're founding it in
the brain of epileptic but considering

204
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,700
you've  lived your whole life 
and never had a single seizure,

205
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,700
I think it's safe to assume it's benign.

206
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,600
You think or you know ?

207
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,800
I know.

208
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,900
Trust me, Mr. Dubois, if the angioma had been 
affecting your wife in any negative way

209
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,300
she would've known about it a long time ago.

210
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,700
I would've been having seizures.

211
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,600
That's one possibility, yes.

212
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,500
But angiomas in this part of the brain have 
also been associated to visual trouble,ephemera.

213
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,300
I'm sorry, ephemera ?

214
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,500
A fancy word for hallucinations.

215
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,800
Hearing voices, seeing people 
and things that aren't really there.

216
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,600
But... since you didn't check the box for that, either,

217
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,500
I don't think you have to worry about.

218
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,200
Hearing voices...uh, seeing people 
and things there aren't really there.

219
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,200
Uh, stop me if any of this starts to sound familiar.

220
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:05,900
Not funny.

221
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,700
It's not meant to be. But think about it Alison.

222
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,100
What if this angioma

223
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,000
is the reason that you see the things that you see,

224
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,600
the reason that you hearthe things that you hear?

225
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
They're not hallucination.

226
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,000
No, I know that.

227
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,700
So what are you getting at ?

228
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,600
I'm getting at a theorie,

229
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,500
I'm getting at the possibility thats this 
little peanut that we found in your brain today

230
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,000
might be what makes you so different from all the other girls.

231
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,300
You're angry.

232
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,000
You're psychic-- you must have 
a little peanut in your head .

233
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,900
Actually, I'm not.

234
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:45,500
I'm  trying to figure out why you'suddenly so obsessed
 with reducing what I do to something... physiological.

235
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,600
I'm a scientist, and taking complicated things and 
reducing them to their simplest eles is what I do.

236
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,300
And you, my dear, are a very complicated thing.

237
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Something the matter?

238
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,400
I-I don't know. I can't seem to find my car.

239
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,000
You don't remember what level you parked it on?

240
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
No, I-I thought...

241
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,400
Well, I'm sure  it's around here somewhere.

242
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,200
What kind of car do you drive?

243
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,700
What kind of car?

244
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,000
The make, the color-- that sort of stuff.

245
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,000
Nothing. I just wanted to make sure you were you.

246
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,800
Can't you do that when I'm asleep?

247
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,900
Mommy, where were you born?

248
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,200
I was born in Chelsea, Oklahoma,sweets.

249
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And what's your middle name?

250
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:59,200
Louise. My name is Allison Louise Dubois,
and I drive a metallic beige station wagon.

251
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,400
Good morning, girls.

252
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,500
- Morning, Daddy. 
- Hi, Daddy!

253
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,800
Good morning.

254
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,700
What's your name again?

255
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,400
I know what you're up to.

256
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,000
You're not really kissing me, 
you're kissing my inner peanut.

257
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,700
Please! There are children in the room!

258
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,500
What? Was it something I said?

259
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,300
You got a love note from that Scanlon fellow.

260
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,500
Good news, girls...
Mommy's completely back to normal.

261
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:42,800
Hi.

262
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,200
I don't understand, this is her.

263
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,500
This is the girl I saw getting into David Saunders' car.

264
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,300
Can't you at least question him about her?

265
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,500
Based on what?

266
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,600
Based on, I saw her tied to his bed.

267
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,500
Based on,I think he suffocated her,
along with all the other girls I saw.

268
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,100
I don't know what to tell you, Allison.

269
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,000
I ran a check on this guy, and he is a Boy Scout.

270
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,600
No priors, no arsts, no stints in rehab.

271
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,400
Just a couple of unpaid speeding tickets
 from six or seven years ago.

272
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,700
The guy's married, owns a copy shop, pays his taxes.

273
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,900
Picks up prostitutes and smothers them.

274
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,300
Maybe. Look, all I have to go on is a missing
 persons report filed by a fellow prostitute.

275
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,100
Right? For all we know, this, uh...

276
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,600
Jade girl could've up and moved to L.A. 
and just didn't bother to tell anyone.

277
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
For six years?

278
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,200
Come on, this report was filed in 1999.

279
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,100
Did the cops even look into it?

280
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,400
I'm sure the department did the best 
they could with what they were given--

281
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,400
the woman who filed the report didn't
 even know her friend 's real name.

282
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,100
She said Jade was just her street name.

283
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,900
Didn't know any of her friends,
didn't know anything about her family.

284
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
That's not a lot to go on.

285
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,400
Did you say this guy owns a copy shop?

286
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,900
'Kay, thank you very much. Have a good day.

287
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:52,900
Can  I...

288
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,200
Hey, you survived.

289
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,900
My goodness, from the MRI! Hi!

290
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
So, you work here?

291
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,000
Kind of. This is my store. I own this place.

292
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,100
You're kidding.

293
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,600
I've never been in here before...
 what are the chances?

294
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,700
I know. Amazing. So, really, 
how'd it go yesterday with your MRI?

295
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,100
It went well. I-I took your suggestion.
 I told myself that I was riding on a train

296
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,900
and it really relaxed me.

297
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,500
It relaxed me a little too much.

298
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,100
I think I fell asleep, my head went to the side,

299
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
and half my views came out blurry.

300
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,900
I have to go back again tomorrow.

301
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:26,900
Oh, no.

302
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,600
Yeah, well, that's why it's good I have a season pass.

303
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,100
So, what can I do for you today, Miss...?

304
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,100
Dubois. Allison Dubois.

305
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,400
I don't know if I mentioned that I work 
part-time at the district attorney's office.

306
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,800
No, you didn't.

307
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,800
I also help out with this, uh, missing persons group.

308
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,500
This girl has been missing for the last seven years,

309
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,400
and we're finally reopening the case.

310
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,000
I was wondering if you wouldn't mind
 putting this flyer in your front window.

311
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Her name's Jade. She's a prostitute.

312
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,800
She's been missing since 1999.

313
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,300
Uh, this is strange.

314
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,000
Really? Why do you say that?

315
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,400
Hey, Angela, come here a minute.

316
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,000
Dave?

317
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,300
You have no idea how embarrassing I was.

318
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,200
Well, you handed a man that's been nothing 
but nice to you a photograph of a prostitute

319
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,100
that looked remarkably like his wife.

320
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,700
I think I have a pretty good idea 
how embarrassed you were.

321
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,800
He even showed it to her.

322
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,300
Really? How'd she take it?

323
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,300
Eh, she laughed.

324
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,000
She thought it was pretty funny. So did he.

325
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,500
Then he offered to make free copies so 
I could put it in as many windows as possible.

326
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,100
The fiend!

327
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,300
First he kidnaps them, then he kills them, then
he offers to reproduce their image,free of charge,

328
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,900
so the police can have an easier time finding them.

329
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,900
Clearly u're dealing with an evil genius here.

330
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,800
Well, that's the thing-- 
when I was around him yesterday,

331
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,500
I didn't feel anything like that.

332
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,200
All I felt was kindness and warmth and honesty.

333
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,600
And suddenly the idea of him hurting these girls,

334
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,600
it made absolutely no sense to me.

335
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,700
'Cause even the thought
 of doing something so horrific,

336
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,200
so hideously evil wouldn't even
 enter a mind of a man like that.

337
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,700
I don't understand how I could
 have been so wrong about him.

338
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,200
Well, let's not forget about that bump on your head.

339
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,500
Yesterday, when you had all these visions,

340
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,600
that bump was fresh-- maybe they're swelling,
 maybe you're a little off your game.

341
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,200
Are you implying my peanut's 
not all it's cracked up to be?

342
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Actually I'm glad you brought that up.

343
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,400
Remember we were talking about yesterday
 about the possiblilty that the peanut--

344
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,900
that growth inside your head--

345
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,600
is what makes you so sensitive?

346
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
You realize you're looking 
at me like I'm a petri dish?

347
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,400
Look, it got me to thinking.

348
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,200
What if I have somebody actually test that theory?

349
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,400
How would someone prove a 
correlation between venous angiomas

350
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,000
and increased sensitivity to... I don't know... 
various psychic phenomenon?

351
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,100
Gosh, Mr. Wizard, I don't know.

352
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,200
I guess you'd have to find somebody 
else who's kind of sensitive

353
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,000
and scan their brain see if there's an angioma.

354
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,200
That's my thought exactly.

355
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,800
You can't be serious.

356
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,200
Oh, I'm  completely serious.

357
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,400
- There's no way in the wide world I'm gonna let you. 
- It's perfectly safe, Al.

358
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,800
- You're subjecting our daughters to MRIs! 
- There's no radiation, no side-effects.

359
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,700
Dr. Sooran said she wouldn't
 even charge us a dime.

360
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,100
You already spoke to her?

361
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,300
Not about the psychic stuff. 
Just about getting scanned for the girls.

362
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,100
See if they gave angiomas, too.

363
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,500
It's intriguing, Al, the possibility 
that there might be a genetic link.

364
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,700
I mean, it's pretty heady stuff.
 No pun intended.

365
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,800
What about the girls?

366
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,900
Have you at least thought about how traumatic it 
could be to be trapped in that metal,clanging coffin

367
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,800
so that Daddy could take pictures of your brain?

368
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,500
There's a machine that can
 take a picture of my brain?

369
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,500
It's called an MRI, sweetie, and there's no reason
 in the wide world that you should get one

370
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,100
'cause you're perfectly fine.

371
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,800
But what if I want one?

372
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,400
Try to stay perfectly still, honey.

373
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,300
Sorry! My toe itched, but I think I got it.

374
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,100
This is gonna make for 
one hell of a show-and-tell.

375
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,800
Cooool.

376
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Like mother, like daughter.

377
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
You found another peanut?

378
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,700
The exact same spot as Mom.

379
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,500
I have a peanut in my head?

380
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,400
Just a little extra lump of brain that looks like one.

381
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,800
And Mommy has one, too?

382
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,500
That's right, kiddo. Mommy has one, too.

383
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,700
I understand there's another daughter.

384
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,600
Perhaps we could find the time.

385
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,200
Perhaps we could find the time 
to perform a scan on her as well.

386
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,100
You did a wonderful job, Bridgette.

387
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,700
I'm sure your mom and 
dad are real proud of you.

388
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,200
Hey, honey.

389
00:24:10,601 --> 00:24:12,501
Would you like me to touch you now?

390
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,200
Want me to scratch your back?

391
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,500
I give a great massage.

392
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,400
Maybe I could wash you.

393
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,800
If you untie me... We can take a bath.

394
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,600
Please, baby?

395
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,300
It's starting to hurt.

396
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,400
S hhh...

397
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,200
Do you like the desert? 

398
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,900
What are you doing?

399
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,700
Again, I don't know what this all means.

400
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,000
This extra pocket of blood flow to the brain.

401
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,900
Perhaps I could interview you sometime.

402
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,100
Interview you both.

403
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,500
See if there's some manisfestation of all this
 that we can identify and quantify.

404
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,400
But first we need to get Ariel in here.

405
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,500
Yes, if they all have it, 
then we're truly onto something.

406
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,900
Well, I say that was two hours very well spent.

407
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,800
You understand her point about Ariel?

408
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,600
Mrs. Dubois!

409
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,600
Back for seconds.

410
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,100
Hi.

411
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,200
Hi.

412
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,300
How you doing?

413
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,800
That was you in there?

414
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,600
I told you, I'm a regular.

415
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,800
The joke around here is that I keep 
mistaking this place for a tanning salon.

416
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,300
Hey, did you ever find that girl?

417
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,600
No. Not yet.

418
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,300
The desert.

419
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,100
They think she was buried in the desert,
 along with a few others.

420
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,100
You mean someone...

421
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,100
Smothered them...

422
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,100
and buried them.

423
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,900
That's the theory.

424
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,600
And they've been rotting in the sun ever since.

425
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,900
They've been sitting there and rotting
 for the last five or six years.

426
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,300
Excuse me. I...

427
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,300
I think a simple "No. We're still working on it. 
She hasn't turned up yet." would have sufficed.

428
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You meet him, you're with him. 
He seems like the nicest guy in the world.

429
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,500
He goes into this machine, he gets scanned, 
and suddenly I see this whole other side of him.

430
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,200
Maybe you do and maybe you don't.

431
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
What's that mean?

432
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,500
Allison, I believe you when 
you say you see his thoughts,

433
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,500
but thoughts are not necessarily memories.

434
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,400
They can be ideas or fantasies.

435
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,400
Didn't you say that his wife first 
appeared to you as a prostitute?

436
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,100
Wall, from what I've read, he wouldn't be the 
first man to have had that particular daydream.

437
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:28,200
Well, with all due respect, sir, these are violent,
 gruesome, horrible encounters that I'm seeing.

438
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,100
But if they never really happened,

439
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,800
they're not illegal.

440
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,000
Allison, I don't know what to tell you.

441
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,400
The man you're suspicious of has no real record.

442
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,500
There appear to be no real victims, and my suspicion is,

443
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,200
what we've got here is no real crime.

444
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,500
Allison?

445
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,300
Allison?

446
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,500
Excuse me.

447
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,600
Allison!

448
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,200
Mrs. Saunders.

449
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,700
Angela, are you looking for me?

450
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,900
If I tell you a secret...

451
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,400
If I take you into my confidence,

452
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,600
how can I be sure that 
you aren't gonna tell my husband?

453
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,900
When your husband isn't 
running his copy shop,

454
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,300
does he work for the prosecutor's office?

455
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,700
Then I have no reason to 
tell him anything, Angela.

456
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,900
It's not Angela.

457
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,300
Um... it's Jade.

458
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,400
Actually, or Melanie.

459
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,100
Really, but, um...

460
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,700
My name, my street name--

461
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,200
at least the first time that I met David-- was Jade.

462
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,400
I'd seen his car around before.

463
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
There was something about him... some...

464
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,400
essense that you picked up.
 This, uh, this core of niceness.

465
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,200
Hey, loverboy, you lonely?

466
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:58,900
Sure.

467
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,000
Oh, I was such a mess.

468
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,600
I even let him tie me up.

469
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,300
What's that?

470
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,500
The train.

471
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,200
We're a block away.

472
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,700
There was one little problem.

473
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,800
He finished too early.

474
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,600
You see, my pimp and I had 
come to this new arrangement.

475
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,900
When I came across someone 
who wanted to take me home,

476
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,700
if it seemed like he had some money and...

477
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,800
wouldn't put up much of a fuss, 
my pimp would follow us,

478
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:45,200
and then he would break in and rob the place 
while I kept the john occupied in the bedroom.

479
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:45,800
Shh!

480
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,900
Do you like the desert?

481
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,300
So he broke in around midnight,

482
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,500
...knocked over a lamp 
on his way into the window.

483
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,200
Wh-Where you are going, baby?

484
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,400
Come back, baby, come back!

485
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,300
They met each other in the hallway. 
There was a fight.

486
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,300
And then I heard a gunshot.

487
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,200
What did you do?

488
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,400
What did you do?!

489
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,400
He dragged me out of there.

490
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,900
David was lying there in the hallway,

491
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
bleeding from his head.

492
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,100
He wasn't moving.

493
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
What did you do?

494
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,900
I waited till my pimp got high and then...

495
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,400
I snuck away and I called 911.

496
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,300
The next day I read in the paper that 
a bullet had passed through David's skull.

497
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,500
He almost bled to death on the floor.

498
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,000
So you saved his life.

499
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,100
Yeah.

500
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,100
In a strange way, he, uh, 
he returned the favor.

501
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,800
I don't know what it was...

502
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,900
but being that close to death-- 
something about it, it... it changed me.

503
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,000
I got myself off the street.

504
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
I checked into rehab.

505
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,700
A couple months later,I was deep into
 the program. You know, the 12 steps?

506
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,900
And I had taken all my personal inventory 
and now it was time for step nine:

507
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,000
making amends.

508
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,500
I went to David's hospital room,

509
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:30,700
all ready to tell him what I'd done, you know,
 accept responisibility,take the consequences.

510
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,300
And that's when I realized 
he didn't remember me.

511
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,300
He didn't remember anything.

512
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,900
His life before that night--it was a blank.

513
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,100
He had been in the hospital 
for months with his friends

514
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,900
coming by every day, trying to
 fill in his memory for him,

515
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,600
reminding him that, uh,
 he loved watching baseball.

516
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,600
That his favorite food was pizza.

517
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,600
Of course they couldn't fill him in...

518
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,100
on the parts of his life that
 they didn't know anything about--

519
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,900
the cruising, the girls off the street.

520
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,700
And they didn't know anything about 
what got him into the hospital

521
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,100
except for what they read 
in the paper, you know,

522
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,800
that a man had broken into his 
home and shot him, left him for dead.

523
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,400
I started visiting him every day,

524
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,100
First at the hospital,then at his business.

525
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,800
I should have told him then, you know?

526
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I should have told him everything.

527
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,200
But I couldn't.

528
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,200
Before I knew it I was in love.

529
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,100
And so was he.

530
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,500
We've been married for five years now. 
We want to have a family.

531
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,700
That man who used to pick up girls off
 the street? He doesn't exist anymore.

532
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,200
And that girl that, uh, you're looking for?

533
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,800
Well, she's fine.

534
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,100
Oh, she's better than fine.

535
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,800
Isn't there any way that
we can put the past behind us?

536
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,400
Particularly when there is
 so much future to look forward to?

537
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:18,500
Wow...

538
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,200
Let me see what I can do.

539
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,100
And he has no idea?

540
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,300
About her past? Apparently not.

541
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,800
And the ultimate romantic irony?

542
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,200
She has no idea about his.

543
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,900
Although, who am I kidding?
 I'm not certain about his past either.

544
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,300
Maybe Devalos was right.

545
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,800
Maybe what I tapped into when he was in 
that machine was some sort of dark fantasy.

546
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,500
I can feel the heat coming 
off your brain from here.

547
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,800
What are you chewing on?

548
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,300
Mm, nothing much. Just the mystery of life.

549
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,800
That again.

550
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:11,200
You need to get your head out of the clouds
 and think about something that matters.

551
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,000
Mm...Are we really just the sum of our memories?

552
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,900
Wait a second. I know the answer to that.
 I read it in a magazine.

553
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,300
I mean, David Saunders,
he looks at his wife and he sees...

554
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:31,400
this wonderful woman that he met in the hospital
 while he was recovering from a horrible accident.

555
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
That's who she is to him, that's all he knows,

556
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,600
and when he wakes up in the 
morning he looks in the mirror

557
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:45,500
he doesn't see a guy who went cruising downtown 
looking for strangers to have sex with, or worse.

558
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
He sees the guy that I see when
 I go visit him at the print shop.

559
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,100
A member of the Chamber of Commerce.

560
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,500
A little league sponsor. A devoted husband.

561
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,500
Well, maybe.

562
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,400
What do you mean maybe?

563
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,000
I mean, who knows what
really goes on in someone's brain?

564
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,000
Who knows what memories actually 
survive and what might trigger them.

565
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,300
Anyway, what are we talking about?

566
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,000
Didn't you tell me you were pretty much convinced

567
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,700
that whatever you saw didn't really happen?

568
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:12,900
Was only in his head.

569
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,800
No, I keep thinking...

570
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,600
if I see it, it's in his head,

571
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,800
and if it's in his head, it's in his head for a reason.

572
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,200
If a memory is killed in the forest 
and there's no one there to hear it...

573
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,800
Ha, ha, ha.

574
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,200
What time do we have to go 
to this MRI place in the morning?

575
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,500
I don't know what to tell you. I don't see it.

576
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,200
I don't see any signs of venous 
angioma in Ariel's brain.

577
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,500
- Oh...
- Oh.

578
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,700
- Hey.
- Hey.

579
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,300
Good news.

580
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,600
Absolutely. Very good.

581
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
You're disappointed, aren't you?

582
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,900
Ah, it was a nice theory.

583
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,800
Would ha answered a lot of questions.

584
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,500
I admit it, I had visions of newborns all over 
the world being tested for the "Dubois angioma".

585
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,800
Ah, the Dubois angioma. Nice.

586
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,400
Hi, sorry I'm late. You wanted to see me?

587
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,200
Yeah. No big deal.

588
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,000
I just wanted to let you know that I received
 the rest of the inquiry on David Saunders.

589
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,900
Went all the way back to 1995 
and there's really nothing there.

590
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,200
A couple of neighbors'complaints about noise,

591
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,700
a parking ticket, a couple of traffic violations...

592
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,900
What are these?

593
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,600
Those are evidence shots from 
a photo-enforced stoplight he ran in 1998.

594
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,100
You've seen them-- you run the light and 
it automatically takes pictures of the car,

595
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
whoever's driving, the license plate...

596
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,200
Pretty much eliminates people going
 to trial over traffic tickets-- why?

597
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,800
See this woman here in the front seat?

598
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,800
I've seen her before.

599
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,600
It's not about you. It's about him.

600
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,700
Well, I guess that's me.

601
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,300
I have no idea who that
 woman seated next to me is.

602
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,400
Her name is Delmy. Delmy O'Toole.

603
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,000
She's a prostitute.

604
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,300
Was a prostitute.

605
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,600
No one here is suggesting that
that's what she was doing in your car,

606
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:45,000
or that you were in engaged in anything 
illegal or inappropriate, Mr. Saunders, but...

607
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,200
we have been conducting a review 
of open missing persons cases.

608
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,900
Miss O'Toole's been missing since the late '90s.

609
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,400
And I am aware of the unique circumstances surrounding 
your memory of anything that might have happened so long ago,

610
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,700
but, still, when we came across this photo...

611
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,900
Well, this is very strange.

612
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,200
I mean, weren't you asking me about 
another missing person just last week?

613
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,600
Another prostitute?

614
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,300
I mean, is their something I don't know?

615
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,900
Was I someone who spent a lot of...

616
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,800
No, uh... We have a right to a lawyer, right?

617
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,100
No, we don't need a lawyer.

618
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,300
I haven't done anything wrong.

619
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,000
And you haven't done anything wrong.

620
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,400
Of course. You always have the right to an attorney, but frankly,

621
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,600
no one here is being accused of anything.

622
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,800
We were just hoping that you could shed 
some light on these missing persons cases.

623
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,000
Cases? You mean there are more?

624
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:36,900
Yes, sir.

625
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,200
- Prostitutes? 
- Oh, David...

626
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,200
No, this is nothing.

627
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,000
This has nothing to do with us.

628
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,500
They're just trying to find some missing people. Sh...

629
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,100
I don't know this woman.

630
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,400
No. I'm sorry.

631
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,900
- No. 
- He doesn't know them...

632
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,100
Okay ? He doesn't. Now, if he met
 them before the accident,

633
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,200
he doesn't remember them.

634
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,900
And besides, what difference 
does that make? That was then.

635
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,900
Do you like the desert, Mr. Saunders?

636
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,800
Do you like the desert?

637
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,900
No, he... no, he doesn't like the desert. 
He refuses to go there.

638
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,400
Okay, where ever it is that
 you're trying to go with this,

639
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,200
- you're barking up... 
- Shut up, Jade!

640
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,500
David, David, I love you.

641
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,500
I've loved you every second of every
 single day since I met you at the hospital.

642
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,500
And whatever happened before,

643
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,500
I swear to God, that doesn't matter, okay? Tell me.

644
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,100
Tell me that it doesn't matter.

645
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,800
I love you, too, Angela.

646
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,400
This isn't about something you did.

647
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,700
I think this is about something I might have done.

648
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,100
Yeah, but I forgive you.

649
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,600
And I love you.

650
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,500
But I'm not so sure you should.

651
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,000
I think perhaps...

652
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,500
perhaps I might not be 
the man you think I am.

653
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,100
No, no...

654
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:00,600
No.

655
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:05,900
Yes.

656
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,200
I'm sorry.

657
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,500
Can I see those pictures again?

658
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,400
I think... I would like to go to the desert, actually.

659
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,800
Do you think we could take a ride?

660
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,000
Oh... look who finally made it home.

661
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:52,700
Hi.

662
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,800
Hi, stranger.

663
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,600
How was the desert?

664
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,700
It was filled with secrets. 
Filled with corpses.

665
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,500
Good for you. You got him.

666
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,800
I guess.

667
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,800
You guess?

668
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,200
I don't know.

669
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,200
We got the right man, 
I guess that's a good thing.

670
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,900
So what's bothering you?

671
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,400
Come here.

672
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,100
Al, what are you doing?

673
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,000
I want to remember this moment 
for the rest of my life.
