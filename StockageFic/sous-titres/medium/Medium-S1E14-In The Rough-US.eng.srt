1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,442
How you doing?

2
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:09,987
Tired, right?

3
00:00:10,682 --> 00:00:11,317
Sleepy?

4
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:14,081
That's okay.

5
00:00:15,018 --> 00:00:16,457
Just relax. Go with it.

6
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:19,274
Close your eyes if you want.

7
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:21,179
Lay down back there.

8
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:22,699
It's okay with me.

9
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:26,943
Damn.

10
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:33,718
You want to see your mommy, you don't say anything.

11
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:35,469
You just go to sleep.

12
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:40,189
License and registration, please.

13
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,723
What do you got back here?

14
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:47,014
My niece. Heading home from the circus.

15
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:47,982
Sorry.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,167
Somebody looks tired.

17
00:00:50,645 --> 00:00:52,016
Somebody wants to get home and into bed.

18
00:00:52,806 --> 00:00:54,822
You've got a rear taillight that's nonfunctional.

19
00:00:55,606 --> 00:00:57,654
I'm going to look the other way this time, 'cause it appears to me

20
00:00:57,689 --> 00:00:59,937
like you got some urgent business in the back seat.

21
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,559
Thank you, Officer.

22
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,413
But I'm gonna need some assurance you'll take care of this first thing tomorrow.

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,803
Absolutely.

24
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:08,426
You have my word, Officer.

25
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:10,969
All right. Let's get this little lady back home and into bed.

26
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:12,936
She can barely keep her eyes open.

27
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:15,319
Are you all right?

28
00:02:19,364 --> 00:02:21,585
Do you need anything? I'll get you some water.

29
00:02:22,523 --> 00:02:23,418
No. I'm all right.

30
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:27,244
God. I hope you're not getting sick again.

31
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:29,921
Not with my mother coming to visit.

32
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:32,578
Please.

33
00:02:32,926 --> 00:02:36,459
One nightmare a night is plenty, thanks.

34
00:03:23,923 --> 00:03:24,691
Ham?

35
00:03:25,327 --> 00:03:26,760
Ham. Hmm.

36
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,047
Okay. I know what that means. That's your "no" voice.

37
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:34,092
Well, no. It's not "no". I just don't think my mother is really a ham person.

38
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:36,160
More of a veal person.

39
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:38,464
A fish person, actually.

40
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:39,283
Fish?

41
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,329
Well, I don't know what to tell you. We don't really have veal kids.

42
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:43,645
We don't have fish kids.

43
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:47,331
We have ham kids. We have chicken finger kids.

44
00:03:47,404 --> 00:03:49,692
Maybe we could make some fish and some chicken fingers.

45
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,513
- Forget I said that.
- I will.

46
00:03:57,998 --> 00:04:00,199
Honey, what are you doing?

47
00:04:00,276 --> 00:04:01,448
I'm building a fort.

48
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:04,550
It's where I'm gonna sleep so Grandma can have my bed.

49
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:06,726
What's the matter? Couch not good enough for you anymore?

50
00:04:06,824 --> 00:04:08,109
This is better.

51
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,577
I don't know.

52
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:12,721
We may want to have a nice dinner in there,

53
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:14,239
it being the dining room and all.

54
00:04:14,402 --> 00:04:15,277
Please?

55
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:17,438
Come on. When's the last time we used the dining room?

56
00:04:17,514 --> 00:04:18,375
Yay!

57
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:22,276
Veal... fish...

58
00:04:23,612 --> 00:04:25,620
This week is going to kill me.

59
00:04:27,156 --> 00:04:28,226
Tell me about it.

60
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,546
You can't do that.

61
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:30,621
Sure, I can.

62
00:04:30,914 --> 00:04:33,279
You're my daughter-in-law. You're married to my son.

63
00:04:33,365 --> 00:04:34,958
It's not like you're naked or anything.

64
00:04:35,143 --> 00:04:36,987
- Besides, we need to talk.
- No, we don't.

65
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:40,110
I have to go to work. I have to take a shower. And you're dead. Now, go away!

66
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:43,436
Relax. Take it from someone who's been there before.

67
00:04:43,707 --> 00:04:46,595
Take it from someone who's seen their life flash before their eyes.

68
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:49,076
There's nothing as important as family.

69
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:50,467
What are you talking about?

70
00:04:50,565 --> 00:04:52,951
You were a workaholic father who ignored his son.

71
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:54,665
You left your wife for another woman.

72
00:04:54,747 --> 00:04:57,813
And the whole time you were alive, you never once visited your grandchildren.

73
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,746
Yeah? So?

74
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,020
It's never too late to change.

75
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:02,644
Oh... Out!

76
00:05:03,528 --> 00:05:04,092
Out!

77
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:06,631
Excuse me?

78
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:08,854
You all right?

79
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:14,716
I don't know. I'll let you know a week from now.

80
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,210
I don't know how familiar this office is with Project Defender,

81
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:21,940
but through the use of modern DNA examination,

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,965
and the implementation of other cutting-edge crime assessment tools,

83
00:05:26,031 --> 00:05:28,135
we've been responsible for the freeing of many prisoners

84
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:30,827
erroneously sentenced to long-term incarceration

85
00:05:30,894 --> 00:05:32,574
and, in some cases, even death.

86
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:35,600
I'm very familiar with your work. What is it that brings you to Phoenix?

87
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:38,846
Beginning last year, the project received a series of letters

88
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:42,564
from an inmate at the Springville Correctional Institute claiming wrongful conviction.

89
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,667
Are you familiar with a Mr. Owen Butler?

90
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:45,938
He's currently serving...

91
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:48,923
A life sentence for the murder of Clancy Donovan in 1995.

92
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:51,943
I'm well aware of the case. I prosecuted it myself.

93
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,942
Now, please don't misunderstand.

94
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:55,824
We're not necessarily alleging prosecutorial misconduct here.

95
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,652
No. Of course not.

96
00:05:58,051 --> 00:06:00,391
You suspect I made an honest mistake.

97
00:06:01,886 --> 00:06:04,406
On the record, the Mayor's office would like you both to know

98
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:06,241
that he supports the work of your project,

99
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:08,174
and he's happy to do anything he can to help.

100
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,907
Please let His Honor know that we appreciate that.

101
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:15,009
Well, now that it's clear that we're all friends...

102
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:17,733
I'm all for exonerating the innocent,

103
00:06:17,907 --> 00:06:21,061
but when it comes to Owen Butler, I'm afraid you're barking up the wrong tree.

104
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:21,973
Are we?

105
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:25,188
Court transcript shows you were never able to establish any real connection

106
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,692
between Mr. Butler and the victim.

107
00:06:26,774 --> 00:06:27,773
I beg to differ.

108
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:30,579
Both men in question were illegal drug users.

109
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,479
It seemed quite clear to both the judge and the jury

110
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,193
that Mr. Butler broke into that apartment looking for drugs.

111
00:06:35,243 --> 00:06:36,324
No. I beg to differ.

112
00:06:36,401 --> 00:06:39,042
You had no witnesses to place him near the crime scene.

113
00:06:39,114 --> 00:06:39,811
True.

114
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:42,601
But, as I recall, he couldn't account for his whereabouts

115
00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:44,371
at the time of the shooting either.

116
00:06:44,474 --> 00:06:47,786
I mean, it's not as if his alibi didn't check out. He simply had none.

117
00:06:47,843 --> 00:06:50,526
The man was so incapacitated by his drug habit

118
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:53,021
he had no idea where he was an hour before being questioned,

119
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:54,572
much less at the time of the shooting.

120
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:57,363
Be that as it may, there's still no forensic evidence

121
00:06:57,412 --> 00:07:01,575
to indicate he was ever in that apartment-- no fingerprints, no DNA evidence-- nothing.

122
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:05,702
Yes, I know. Nothing except a .38 caliber slug that passed through Mr. Donovan's skull

123
00:07:05,743 --> 00:07:10,117
and embedded itself in the wall of his apartment-- a .38 caliber slug

124
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:13,336
that matched the gun that we found in the trunk of Butler's car.

125
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,160
True.

126
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,822
It still doesn't prove he was the one that pulled the trigger.

127
00:07:18,093 --> 00:07:18,985
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:23,807
I prosecuted this case almost ten years ago, and a jury of 12 citizens found Mr. Butler guilty.

129
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,867
Now, if you've uncovered some evidence that shows somehow we got it wrong,

130
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:29,393
I'm happy to hear it.

131
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,532
If not, I need to get on with my day.

132
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:37,674
Mr. District Attorney?

133
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:39,786
They're on a fishing expedition.

134
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:41,619
Fine. Then let's let them fish.

135
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:43,950
Just so they don't go to the press and claim we're stonewalling.

136
00:07:44,026 --> 00:07:46,479
I mean, as long as you're completely confident the case against Butler

137
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,486
is going to hold up, this shouldn't be a problem.

138
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:49,278
You're right.

139
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:50,570
There is no problem.

140
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:51,706
Excellent.

141
00:07:52,136 --> 00:07:53,912
And I'll be sure and share that with the Mayor.

142
00:07:58,951 --> 00:08:04,168
Butler lost his job as a landscaper back in 93 when he was picked up for indecent exposure.

143
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,701
Took to petty theft to finance a worsening drug habit.

144
00:08:07,763 --> 00:08:11,956
Ended up shooting a man execution-style during a bungled robbery.

145
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,461
He's ten years into a life sentence at Springville.

146
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:16,482
Sounds pretty open and shut.

147
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:17,373
It was.

148
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:22,790
And why they're choosing to reopen this particular can of worms right now is beyond me,

149
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:26,738
but I need someone to interface between their group and ours,

150
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:28,591
and I'm a little shorthanded.

151
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:32,937
Wait a second. It doesn't sound like something I'm particularly well-suited for.

152
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:35,156
Frankly, it sounds like something for a lawyer.

153
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,318
I'm confused.

154
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:38,304
Didn't you study to be a lawyer?

155
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:42,967
Welcome back to Phoenix, Ma.

156
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,807
Happy Mother's Day.

157
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:48,974
Well, happy week leading up to Mother's Day.

158
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,635
Yes. Well, happy week leading up to Mother's Day to you, too.

159
00:08:52,808 --> 00:08:54,437
For what it's worth, you're looking good.

160
00:08:54,646 --> 00:08:56,096
Oh, you're sweet to say that.

161
00:08:57,242 --> 00:09:01,569
Truth is, I had a long winter, and I didn't get out as much as I would've liked.

162
00:09:01,748 --> 00:09:03,341
Mother, what are you talking about? What about the cruise?

163
00:09:03,411 --> 00:09:04,386
Oh, no. You're right.

164
00:09:04,498 --> 00:09:06,064
You're right. The cruise was nice.

165
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:08,419
I mean, if you like that sort of thing.

166
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:09,546
You don't like that sort of thing?

167
00:09:09,613 --> 00:09:11,569
No, no. I liked it.

168
00:09:12,224 --> 00:09:13,182
It was nice.

169
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:15,167
You get on a big boat.

170
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:17,129
- You sail around.
- Right.

171
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:19,084
You come back to the place where you started.

172
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,276
I don't know.

173
00:09:21,363 --> 00:09:25,136
In retrospect, I'm not sure I accomplished all that much.

174
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:32,562
So, is Ariel any taller?

175
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:34,025
Does Marie talk yet?

176
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:36,227
Has Bridgette learned to brush her own hair?

177
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,773
You got way too many questions, Ma.

178
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:39,784
I'm gonna have to book you a later return ticket.

179
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,074
I've never seen him before.

180
00:09:44,248 --> 00:09:45,289
Why would I kill him?

181
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:47,967
Maybe you knew he kept drugs in the apartment.

182
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,570
How would I know that?

183
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:51,991
You've never done business together?

184
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:53,368
You've never bought from him?

185
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,352
No. Never.

186
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,961
Mr. Butler, you can't tell me where you ate lunch today,

187
00:09:58,028 --> 00:10:00,358
but you're certain you've never seen this man before.

188
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:03,476
If I could have a taste, I'd remember a little better.

189
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:05,160
Ms. Dubois?

190
00:10:05,816 --> 00:10:06,521
Sorry.

191
00:10:07,277 --> 00:10:09,349
Gary Craig, Project Defender.

192
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:13,823
This is Deborah. She's a student at ASU, and one of the interns down at the project.

193
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:14,826
Nice to meet you both.

194
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,456
District Attorney Devalos asked me to sit in on any interviews,

195
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:20,530
and to help in any way I can.

196
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:24,626
Much appreciated. The less adversarial we can make this whole process, the better.

197
00:10:24,693 --> 00:10:26,240
I have a question, though. This man...

198
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:27,730
Have you looked at his rap sheet?

199
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:31,599
He's no angel. Are you sure this is someone whose innocence you want to champion?

200
00:10:31,677 --> 00:10:33,014
I'm sorry. I don't see it that way.

201
00:10:33,413 --> 00:10:35,844
It's not for me to judge someone's worth.

202
00:10:36,044 --> 00:10:40,247
The question on the table is, is he guilty of the crime for which he was tried and convicted?

203
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:43,611
Our purpose is to serve as an extra check and balance to make sure

204
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:47,206
that the system works at its most evenhanded and fair-minded.

205
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:51,774
These are copies of all the correspondence we received from the accused and his prior counsel.

206
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:52,576
Thank you.

207
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:07,532
Mr. Butler.

208
00:11:17,022 --> 00:11:17,989
How you doing?

209
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:25,171
Ew! It smells like fish in here.

210
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:26,206
It's salmon.

211
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:29,759
Marjorie, um... how much tonic should I put in your gin?

212
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,088
Oh, just the tiniest of tiny splashes, darling.

213
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:33,803
In fact, don't even bother.

214
00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:36,594
What's this?

215
00:11:36,849 --> 00:11:37,720
Napkin.

216
00:11:39,203 --> 00:11:42,447
Sorry, Mom. I was at the store, I had it on my list and everything.

217
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:50,990
You want a chicken finger, Grandma?

218
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,353
Mmm! Didn't know chickens had fingers.

219
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:57,448
Bridgette, Bridgette, thank you for sharing, but... let Grandma eat her own food.

220
00:11:57,909 --> 00:12:01,446
So, Allison, tell me about your work.

221
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:03,623
Oh, I don't know, it's part time.

222
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:05,056
I work for the District Attorney.

223
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:06,705
Sort of a paralegal thing?

224
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,518
Well, there's definitely some "para..."

225
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:11,747
and I do believe there's some "legal" in there, too, so...

226
00:12:11,823 --> 00:12:13,629
Oh, I... I do a lot of different things.

227
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,206
It must be quite a balancing act with the house and the kids.

228
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:20,042
I don't know. It seems to work out for the most part.

229
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,962
I'm kind of on-call, so it depends what's happening...

230
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,110
That's so nice.

231
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,330
And I guess the extra income comes in handy, too, hmm?

232
00:12:26,504 --> 00:12:28,097
Maybe you can finally get some help.

233
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,736
What kind of help, Grandma?

234
00:12:29,843 --> 00:12:34,129
Oh, you know, some nice lady who could straighten up and make the beds...

235
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:36,857
make sure there's napkins.

236
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:39,504
Mom...

237
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,182
- What?
- Would you excuse me?

238
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:52,166
It's not what you think.

239
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:54,085
What are you talking about?

240
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:56,595
She's a witch. She's a smiling cobra, she's...

241
00:12:56,682 --> 00:12:57,645
Lonely.

242
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:02,293
Everything else you said, too, but mostly she's lonely.

243
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:04,787
She wants to move here.

244
00:13:05,497 --> 00:13:06,573
She wants to live here.

245
00:13:06,968 --> 00:13:08,376
She wants to be the help.

246
00:13:09,676 --> 00:13:11,447
That's what I was trying to tell you before.

247
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,507
You sure?

248
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,016
Yeah.

249
00:13:18,652 --> 00:13:20,654
This is something you picked up from her?

250
00:13:23,115 --> 00:13:24,029
No.

251
00:13:32,215 --> 00:13:34,657
Okay, look, I told you I can't handle that.

252
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:36,740
- I don't know, it's just... it's...
- I'm sorry.

253
00:13:36,826 --> 00:13:39,937
I mean, most people lose their parents and they lose them.

254
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:44,165
Okay, let's not focus on the messenger, let's just focus on the message.

255
00:13:52,008 --> 00:13:53,930
Okay, look, she's my mother.

256
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:56,780
The thing is, she's not your mother.

257
00:13:58,262 --> 00:13:59,495
So how do you feel?

258
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,530
Me? I was just hoping to live through Mother's Day.

259
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:06,391
Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.

260
00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:10,032
Maybe I should have kept it to myself.

261
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:14,655
I mean, there's nothing to do until she says something, right?

262
00:14:15,013 --> 00:14:15,859
True.

263
00:14:16,662 --> 00:14:18,996
I mean, who knows? Maybe my dad's off base on this.

264
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,875
I mean, if he was so good at reading my mother, then how come they get divorced?

265
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:25,372
God, it's never boring around here.

266
00:14:34,097 --> 00:14:37,385
My partner and I had just knocked off. We were heading out to a bar to catch a game.

267
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:41,065
I remember because the Suns were in the playoffs against the Rockets.

268
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:45,135
Anyway, a uniformed patrolman responded to a shots-fired call,

269
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:46,636
discovered a dead body.

270
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:51,736
Actually, um... the victim may have still been alive when the uniform arrived on the scene.

271
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:53,063
I-I don't recall.

272
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,625
We were nearby, so they had us take the call.

273
00:14:57,669 --> 00:15:00,260
In any event, when my partner and I arrived

274
00:15:00,828 --> 00:15:04,228
the uniform showed us the apartment had been broken in through a back window.

275
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:05,790
And at that point anyway,

276
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:10,556
Mr. Donovan, the victim, was dead from a single gunshot wound to the head.

277
00:15:11,104 --> 00:15:14,724
The bullet was from a weapon we later found in Mr. Butler's possession.

278
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:18,177
And how did you come to find the gun in Butler's car?

279
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:21,069
An anonymous caller phoned it in, I believe.

280
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:24,370
Said he'd overheard Butler bragging about the crime.

281
00:15:24,637 --> 00:15:27,207
We got a search warrant, went to Butler's apartment.

282
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,839
Neighbor said he hadn't been home for days.

283
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:31,293
Was that unusual?

284
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:36,254
Apparently not. She said he sometimes went on week-long crack binges.

285
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,199
When we finally caught up to Butler,

286
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:40,474
we found the gun in the trunk of his car.

287
00:15:41,076 --> 00:15:44,190
Forensics matched it with the bullet that killed Donovan.

288
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:45,941
It should all be there in the record.

289
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:50,259
Detective Rickey, how thoroughly did you examine that apartment for evidence?

290
00:15:50,738 --> 00:15:52,818
I don't know, I think we were there a day and a half.

291
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:57,840
In all that time you didn't find one fingerprint belonging to the accused?

292
00:15:58,108 --> 00:16:00,979
I mean... if the man was there to steal drugs,

293
00:16:01,056 --> 00:16:05,162
presumably he would've left some prints in and around the drugs.

294
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:06,304
Doesn't that make sense?

295
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:08,104
He was wearing gloves.

296
00:16:09,196 --> 00:16:10,354
He brought the gun.

297
00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:12,417
He knew what he was going to do.

298
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,650
Why would he go out of his way to leave prints for us?

299
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:19,421
He didn't go out of his way to leave fiber evidence for you either, according to your report.

300
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:22,882
He also left no eyewitnesses to place him at the scene of the crime

301
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:25,059
and no DNA to prove he was there.

302
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:28,678
It's a pretty well thought-out crime for a crack-addicted petty thief, wouldn't you say?

303
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:33,076
Thank you for coming in, Detective.

304
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:38,048
Next witness, 10:30. Why don't we take a few minutes?

305
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,622
Hi, honey, it's me. I tried to call your mom on her cell phone

306
00:16:40,682 --> 00:16:42,544
to see how she and Marie were doing.

307
00:16:42,861 --> 00:16:44,474
Just went straight to voice mail.

308
00:16:44,965 --> 00:16:46,419
Anyway, I'm on break.

309
00:16:46,675 --> 00:16:47,587
Give me a call.

310
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,426
I love you.

311
00:16:48,606 --> 00:16:49,231
Bye.

312
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,862
Detective...

313
00:16:52,058 --> 00:16:53,295
I thought I might see you here.

314
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:56,265
Which way to the Project Pretender fiasco?

315
00:16:56,387 --> 00:16:57,325
Be nice.

316
00:16:57,494 --> 00:17:00,009
Wait a second, I didn't know you were a part of all this.

317
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:03,813
I don't remember seeing "Detective Lee Scanlon" on any of the reports.

318
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:05,456
Well, we're talking ten years ago.

319
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:08,533
I was Patrolman Leland Scanlon if you please.

320
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:12,311
And I was the responding uniformed officer the night Donovan was murdered.

321
00:17:12,387 --> 00:17:14,574
Oh, my God, I am so glad to see you.

322
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,826
Why, you tired of making small talk with the bleeding hearts?

323
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:20,084
Well, actually, these people are presenting a very compelling argument.

324
00:17:20,221 --> 00:17:22,588
The case against Butler isn't terribly strong.

325
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,096
I hate to see him get out of jail because of it.

326
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:27,882
I'd really hate to see what it would do to District Attorney Devalos.

327
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:29,069
Allison...

328
00:17:29,535 --> 00:17:32,920
trust me, those people will never get this guy off.

329
00:17:35,326 --> 00:17:38,506
Neighbors heard the gunshot in Donovan's apartment, called 911.

330
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:43,456
I got to the door, no one answered. The door was locked, so I forced it open.

331
00:17:44,906 --> 00:17:48,561
I walked into what I guess you would call the main room, the living room.

332
00:17:49,241 --> 00:17:50,978
The body was on the floor...

333
00:17:51,408 --> 00:17:54,675
although I was not immediately certain that the victim had expired.

334
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:57,449
There were drugs and paraphernalia everywhere.

335
00:17:58,176 --> 00:18:01,816
Wasn't for all the blood, you'd have thought he got high watching the game and passed out or something.

336
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:03,921
Then I looked up.

337
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:07,311
I saw some guy on the fire escape.

338
00:18:07,506 --> 00:18:08,939
Couldn't tell you who he was.

339
00:18:09,318 --> 00:18:11,714
He took off like a bat out of hell.

340
00:18:12,354 --> 00:18:15,401
I guess he'd been up there the whole time, hoping and praying I wouldn't notice him.

341
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,632
Soon as our eyes locked, he took off.

342
00:18:19,184 --> 00:18:21,059
And you didn't give chase?

343
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:25,528
I felt like the thing to do was to attempt to revive the victim.

344
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:32,512
I did mouth-to-mouth and CPR for, uh, I don't know, maybe seven, eight minutes.

345
00:18:36,726 --> 00:18:40,049
Anything catch your eye after that point?

346
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,244
The window showed signs of forced entry.

347
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:46,106
I fired we were looking at, uh... a possible robbery attempt.

348
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,818
The truth was, I was in way over my head.

349
00:18:50,684 --> 00:18:53,173
I realized that the victim had expired,

350
00:18:53,515 --> 00:18:56,785
there was nothing for me to do except call it in, wait for the detectives.

351
00:18:59,331 --> 00:19:00,452
You getting all that?

352
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:03,359
Oh, yeah, I got it.

353
00:19:10,306 --> 00:19:12,505
Hey, everybody. Sorry I'm late.

354
00:19:12,838 --> 00:19:16,492
I didn't know what everybody wanted, so I picked up a couple of pizzas.

355
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:19,750
Don't worry, Mom. I got you a salad thing.

356
00:19:19,841 --> 00:19:20,558
Hey, babe.

357
00:19:21,188 --> 00:19:22,275
Look what Mom did.

358
00:19:24,152 --> 00:19:26,216
She cut up the vegetables herself.

359
00:19:26,887 --> 00:19:28,429
It's a crabmeat bisque.

360
00:19:30,107 --> 00:19:32,376
Oh, boy. What a treat.

361
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:34,469
This is so nice.

362
00:19:34,864 --> 00:19:36,363
Excuse me a second.

363
00:19:39,082 --> 00:19:39,861
Wow!

364
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,011
It's clean in here.

365
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,740
Oh, my gosh.

366
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:49,573
Dinner in the dining room?

367
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:52,927
Bridge, what happened to your fort?

368
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:55,031
Grandma bought a magic bed.

369
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:58,698
I picked up one of those inflatable beds that plug into the wall.

370
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,863
That way she can have her bed back,

371
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,815
and you can have your dining room back.

372
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:05,452
Oh, my gosh. Why didn't I think of that?

373
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:09,015
How...? When-when did you do all this?

374
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,420
Well, by the time I got the baby down for her nap

375
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:15,856
and the girls and I got their homework out of the way, it just...

376
00:20:15,968 --> 00:20:17,566
I don't know. It just sort of worked out.

377
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,781
I helped Grandma polish the silver.

378
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:22,020
And she taught me how to brush my hair.

379
00:20:22,117 --> 00:20:23,377
But not at the table, honey.

380
00:20:25,706 --> 00:20:28,425
Is-is it okay? Is... it's not too hot?

381
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:37,789
It's delicious.

382
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:44,567
It's the noise, I think.

383
00:20:47,655 --> 00:20:49,971
That's why we take cruises and...

384
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:54,112
walk through the malls and sleep with the television on.

385
00:20:56,426 --> 00:20:57,640
It's the noise.

386
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:00,549
Kids...

387
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,853
husbands...

388
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,734
You get used to it.

389
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:08,833
And then one day...

390
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:11,184
it's gone.

391
00:21:14,972 --> 00:21:16,165
Your daughters...

392
00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:20,226
are lovely people, you two.

393
00:21:23,512 --> 00:21:25,176
They make a lovely noise.

394
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,226
Oh, dear.

395
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:32,893
Someone's had enough wine...

396
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:39,860
Time to sleep in my magic bed.

397
00:21:44,522 --> 00:21:45,385
Night, Ma.

398
00:21:46,992 --> 00:21:48,024
Sleep tight.

399
00:22:04,454 --> 00:22:06,516
Did she actually say anything to you?

400
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:08,942
Uh, no. But while she was cooking,

401
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,973
I noticed she had the newspaper open to the Real Estate section.

402
00:22:14,744 --> 00:22:16,325
Okay. I'll ask.

403
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,290
Would it be such a horrible thing?

404
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:26,396
Today is not the day to ask me that.

405
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,394
Well, what do you mean?

406
00:22:29,612 --> 00:22:32,048
I don't think I'm ready to discuss that yet.

407
00:22:33,242 --> 00:22:36,574
But I strongly suspect that I will always remember today

408
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:39,858
as the day where little Allison discovered there was no Santa Claus.

409
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,738
'Cause people really aren't good.

410
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:47,276
And justice isn't only blind...

411
00:22:49,104 --> 00:22:50,199
it's in a coma.

412
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:52,964
Okay.

413
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:16,093
Hey, Billy, it's definitely a party out here in front of the arena,

414
00:23:16,158 --> 00:23:21,298
where fans have already started to gather in expectation of a victory celebration.

415
00:23:21,457 --> 00:23:25,609
That's if their home team can hold onto an enormous lead.

416
00:23:32,624 --> 00:23:35,004
Thank you for agreeing to see me without counsel.

417
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:38,482
I'm in here forever.

418
00:23:38,804 --> 00:23:40,108
How much worse can it get?

419
00:23:43,376 --> 00:23:45,373
On the night in question, are you absolutely certain

420
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,614
you have no recollection of where you were?

421
00:23:47,825 --> 00:23:49,336
Where would you like me to have been?

422
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:52,014
My public defender told me...

423
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:55,542
he said, "Owen, all we got's the truth.

424
00:23:56,038 --> 00:23:58,030
And the truth is, you don't know where you were.

425
00:23:58,615 --> 00:24:02,689
Make something up, and they won't even bother to prove you shot this guy.

426
00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:05,966
They'll just prove you're a liar."

427
00:24:11,654 --> 00:24:13,268
Do you like basketball?

428
00:24:15,156 --> 00:24:16,109
What do you mean?

429
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:18,399
Like what? Playing?

430
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:21,344
No. I-I mean... watching it.

431
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:23,647
Do you ever go to a game, or...?

432
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:26,897
Maybe TV sometimes.

433
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:30,625
I-I don't... I don't know.

434
00:24:30,748 --> 00:24:31,941
But you never actually go?

435
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:33,697
To the arena, I mean?

436
00:24:34,525 --> 00:24:36,042
Oh, yeah. 'Course I do.

437
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:39,888
I sit up in the skybox with my pipe. And I fire that bitch up and...

438
00:24:40,193 --> 00:24:42,410
get so high that I can dunk from my seat.

439
00:24:42,821 --> 00:24:44,110
What are you burning, lady?

440
00:24:44,311 --> 00:24:45,899
You know how much it costs to get in there?

441
00:24:46,645 --> 00:24:47,859
I'm sorry, I...

442
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:52,317
I did work the parking lot sometimes, though.

443
00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:56,559
You get those happy white boys with their season tickets

444
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:59,317
and SUVs at the home games,

445
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,853
tailgating it...

446
00:25:01,063 --> 00:25:02,706
coming in and out of the stadium...

447
00:25:03,862 --> 00:25:06,000
They'd be happy to give you a five or ten dollars

448
00:25:06,055 --> 00:25:08,339
just so you won't get too close to their cars.

449
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:11,134
The parking lot?

450
00:25:11,812 --> 00:25:13,459
Right outside the stadium?

451
00:25:13,967 --> 00:25:15,046
Yeah, outside.

452
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:17,023
Course, outside.

453
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:18,835
Thank you.

454
00:25:31,445 --> 00:25:32,705
Let me ask you a question.

455
00:25:33,623 --> 00:25:36,847
Is it completely hypocritical of me to be scared to death

456
00:25:36,905 --> 00:25:39,529
of the possibility of your mother living near us...

457
00:25:39,857 --> 00:25:43,296
while at the same time calling you at work to say do you think it would be okay

458
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:45,735
if I left her with the kids for a little while...

459
00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:48,489
while I go and meet with somebody in about a half an hour?

460
00:25:48,623 --> 00:25:50,538
Yes, it's completely hypocritical,

461
00:25:50,646 --> 00:25:51,874
and I think you should do it.

462
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:05,734
Hey.

463
00:26:07,623 --> 00:26:08,294
Hey.

464
00:26:12,478 --> 00:26:14,280
It's 9:30. I'm missing The Bachelorette.

465
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,238
What's so important it couldn't hold till tomorrow?

466
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:21,989
How far would you say the University of Arizona is from Clancy Donovan's apartment?

467
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,138
Time-wise, I mean?

468
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:24,710
40, 45 minutes.

469
00:26:24,812 --> 00:26:26,409
More on game night, I suppose. Why?

470
00:26:28,883 --> 00:26:30,229
I found this videotape.

471
00:26:30,433 --> 00:26:32,196
The Rockets against the Suns.

472
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,637
'95 playoffs, the night of May 11.

473
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:37,243
Okay.

474
00:26:37,575 --> 00:26:40,447
During the broadcast of the game, around 9:30 p.m.,

475
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:42,363
they show the crowd outside the stadium.

476
00:26:43,397 --> 00:26:45,240
Owen Butler is in that crowd.

477
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:49,019
Lee... he couldn't have been at Clancy Donovan's apartment.

478
00:26:49,086 --> 00:26:50,847
He couldn't have been anywhere near there.

479
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,868
Okay. You say so.

480
00:26:54,564 --> 00:26:55,799
I don't know what to tell you.

481
00:26:56,285 --> 00:26:58,123
I never said I could ID him on that fire escape.

482
00:26:58,189 --> 00:27:00,796
I mean, it's really the gun that put him away.

483
00:27:01,272 --> 00:27:02,822
I didn't have anything to do with that.

484
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:05,308
The man is innocent, Lee.

485
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,016
Innocent?

486
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:08,675
Really?

487
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,198
Sorry, "innocent" is the last thing Owen Butler is.

488
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,787
Did he kill a small-time drug dealer named Clancy Donovan?

489
00:27:18,885 --> 00:27:19,586
Maybe...

490
00:27:20,487 --> 00:27:21,275
maybe not.

491
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:22,570
But innocent?

492
00:27:23,222 --> 00:27:24,332
I beg to differ.

493
00:27:25,515 --> 00:27:27,352
I know what he is.

494
00:27:27,644 --> 00:27:29,703
I know what he is capable of.

495
00:27:29,943 --> 00:27:32,053
But that's not the way the system works.

496
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:33,893
Don't lecture me.

497
00:27:41,735 --> 00:27:45,687
So, you can prove that Owen Butler was at the Suns game on May 11, 1995.

498
00:27:45,883 --> 00:27:47,013
That's cool, Allison.

499
00:27:48,314 --> 00:27:49,211
That's great.

500
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,904
Now do you think you can tell me where Samantha Robinson might have been that night?

501
00:27:55,037 --> 00:27:56,333
Whatever was left of her?

502
00:27:57,454 --> 00:27:58,883
What hole he stuck her in?

503
00:27:59,072 --> 00:28:01,616
What garbage dump? What meat grinder he ran her through?

504
00:28:01,692 --> 00:28:04,860
What tree chipper he fed her four-year-old body into?

505
00:28:06,157 --> 00:28:07,550
Was she the little girl?

506
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:10,044
In the back seat of the car?

507
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:14,141
You were the cop.

508
00:28:14,697 --> 00:28:16,091
You pulled them over.

509
00:28:17,104 --> 00:28:19,233
You saw her in the back seat.

510
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,865
He said they were coming home from the circus.

511
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:25,777
I believed him...

512
00:28:26,994 --> 00:28:28,655
and I wished him a good night.

513
00:28:31,696 --> 00:28:34,148
About an hour and a half later, she was reported missing.

514
00:28:34,497 --> 00:28:37,078
Her mother had gone upstairs to check on her. The window was open.

515
00:28:39,903 --> 00:28:42,090
I didn't know anything till the next day at roll call.

516
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,758
They passed around her picture.

517
00:28:47,287 --> 00:28:48,490
I actually measured.

518
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:53,564
When I was leaning in his car window, I was two and a half feet away from her.

519
00:28:54,552 --> 00:28:55,729
I'm so sorry.

520
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,649
I gave them the plate number.

521
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,021
Turned out the car was stolen.

522
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,212
We didn't even have a name on the guy.

523
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:03,753
They put me with a sketch artist.

524
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:07,829
The whole state was on alert

525
00:29:08,808 --> 00:29:09,699
for days...

526
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,044
but...

527
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,568
Visited her folks a couple of times. Did what I could to keep the case alive.

528
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,576
But I was a patrolman, a beat cop.

529
00:29:23,118 --> 00:29:25,043
A year went by, 18 months.

530
00:29:25,248 --> 00:29:26,215
Never found the girl.

531
00:29:26,303 --> 00:29:27,362
Never found the body.

532
00:29:30,715 --> 00:29:33,091
Then one day, I'm walking by this Laundromat...

533
00:29:35,221 --> 00:29:38,046
He was trying to jimmy open a change machine with a screwdriver.

534
00:29:39,687 --> 00:29:40,654
And I thought...

535
00:29:41,908 --> 00:29:43,086
"Don't blow this.

536
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,799
Don't blow this hauling him in for petty theft.

537
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,925
He'll just get out in two days, and you'll never see him again."

538
00:29:49,865 --> 00:29:51,605
And I started following him around.

539
00:29:53,868 --> 00:29:55,328
Learning everything about him.

540
00:29:57,001 --> 00:29:58,696
Waiting for him to do something.

541
00:29:59,187 --> 00:29:59,984
Anything.

542
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,256
Then, one day...

543
00:30:07,984 --> 00:30:09,684
I answered a shots-fired call.

544
00:30:12,274 --> 00:30:14,829
Guy had blown his own head off. I was the first one there.

545
00:30:15,905 --> 00:30:16,980
It was a gift.

546
00:30:17,569 --> 00:30:18,619
It was Providence.

547
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,128
So, you put the gun in his car.

548
00:30:21,594 --> 00:30:24,655
Then you made an anonymous tip, to be sure they'd find it.

549
00:30:26,498 --> 00:30:28,020
And I'd do it again.

550
00:30:30,603 --> 00:30:31,839
And you know what?

551
00:30:33,503 --> 00:30:34,507
So would you.

552
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:36,749
Yeah.

553
00:30:37,287 --> 00:30:39,192
You're not the only mind reader in the room.

554
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,216
So, do whatever you have to do with your tape.

555
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:48,156
Do what you can live with.

556
00:30:51,253 --> 00:30:52,058
Me?

557
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:55,115
I'm sleeping just fine.

558
00:31:39,922 --> 00:31:41,563
Place looks decent enough.

559
00:31:42,623 --> 00:31:44,170
No thanks to you, I'm sure.

560
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,243
I can't do this right now.

561
00:31:46,397 --> 00:31:48,455
Well, you're going to have to deal with it soon.

562
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:52,045
You've botched this thing so badly.

563
00:31:52,356 --> 00:31:54,307
She actually thinks that you need her here.

564
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:55,306
Excuse me?

565
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:56,867
Why? What'd you do?

566
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,269
I don't smell anything.

567
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,655
No, I mean... what have I botched?

568
00:32:01,728 --> 00:32:04,106
Well, let's start with everything.

569
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,061
The whole reason that I gave you that heads-up

570
00:32:07,123 --> 00:32:09,488
was so that you could nip this thing in the bud.

571
00:32:09,672 --> 00:32:14,495
Make it clear to her that her future it, it's not here, picking up after you.

572
00:32:15,193 --> 00:32:17,337
It's back home in Grosse Pointe.

573
00:32:17,629 --> 00:32:19,067
That's where she belongs.

574
00:32:20,216 --> 00:32:22,861
You're the one who told me that she was lonely.

575
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:27,019
And she is.

576
00:32:28,755 --> 00:32:32,124
But that's because she hasn't met that clown yet.

577
00:32:33,695 --> 00:32:35,554
Wait a second. What clown?

578
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:36,569
Merle.

579
00:32:37,187 --> 00:32:39,316
He is this guy at the club.

580
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,554
Widower.

581
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,559
Loaded.

582
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,320
Got a terrific backhand.

583
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,110
I'm sorry. I'm lost.

584
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:50,393
Who is this guy? Is he a friend of yours? Or Marjorie's...?

585
00:32:50,487 --> 00:32:53,623
I told you. He's just a guy.

586
00:32:54,358 --> 00:32:56,885
He's had his eye on her for a while.

587
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,471
She hasn't figured it out yet...

588
00:32:59,685 --> 00:33:00,622
she will.

589
00:33:01,589 --> 00:33:05,159
Look, deep down I'm not all that crazy about him.

590
00:33:05,204 --> 00:33:07,534
He's got some ideas about things I just...

591
00:33:08,025 --> 00:33:09,223
don't agree with.

592
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:11,757
But...

593
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:17,703
he's going to make her feel really great about herself...

594
00:33:18,604 --> 00:33:19,545
for a while,

595
00:33:21,117 --> 00:33:22,567
and she deserves that.

596
00:33:25,566 --> 00:33:29,182
And that's something that you can see from where you are?

597
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,224
There's not much that you can't see.

598
00:33:33,935 --> 00:33:35,075
Allison?

599
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,614
Oh, did you just get back?

600
00:33:43,893 --> 00:33:45,331
Who you talking to?

601
00:33:45,996 --> 00:33:47,645
Nobody. Just the TV.

602
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:50,450
Are you hungry? I could heat something up.

603
00:33:51,286 --> 00:33:54,265
Oh, God, I was such an ass.

604
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,433
No, I'm okay.

605
00:33:59,645 --> 00:34:01,372
Well, then I'm going to bed.

606
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,310
Night.

607
00:34:08,908 --> 00:34:09,891
Night, Mom.

608
00:34:10,557 --> 00:34:11,406
Night, Mom.

609
00:34:14,201 --> 00:34:15,155
Night, honey.

610
00:34:25,728 --> 00:34:27,545
Whatcha lookin' at in the dark?

611
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:32,163
Nothing.

612
00:34:35,057 --> 00:34:38,451
He said he knew I'd do the same thing if I was in his position.

613
00:34:40,059 --> 00:34:40,766
And...?

614
00:34:42,551 --> 00:34:43,903
And I think he's right.

615
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,644
It's just, I'm not in his position.

616
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,210
So what are you going to do?

617
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:53,130
I already did it.

618
00:34:56,417 --> 00:34:59,126
I left the tape on Devalos's desk.

619
00:35:00,487 --> 00:35:01,927
Wait. I don't get it.

620
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,472
I just left it there.

621
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:04,651
No note.

622
00:35:05,004 --> 00:35:06,094
No explanation.

623
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:11,050
I figured he doesn't need to know where it came from.

624
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:15,372
As far as he's concerned, it just arrived there.

625
00:35:15,509 --> 00:35:16,498
Anonymously.

626
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:21,258
It'll exonerate Butler, but I won't implicate Scanlon.

627
00:35:21,972 --> 00:35:25,267
Putting Butler out on the street is tragedy enough.

628
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:30,373
Hurting a good man who did a bad thing

629
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:33,093
for reasons I completely understand...

630
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,913
I don't think I can be a part of that.

631
00:35:38,248 --> 00:35:38,981
Yeah.

632
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,996
We went through his W-2s, saw that he worked here.

633
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:16,278
You're sure you remember him?

634
00:36:16,397 --> 00:36:17,611
Oh, yeah, I remember him.

635
00:36:18,193 --> 00:36:20,708
Must've been about, uh... ten years ago.

636
00:36:20,785 --> 00:36:22,291
We were in the middle of re-sodding.

637
00:36:22,762 --> 00:36:25,777
He wasn't a bad worker at first, but then he started showing up late,

638
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:27,743
wired on God knows what.

639
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:29,382
Had to let him go eventually.

640
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:33,435
What is she doing, anyway?

641
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:54,557
She's right here.

642
00:37:00,937 --> 00:37:03,020
Samantha's right here.

643
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,606
I'm grateful for Project Defender for believing in me.

644
00:37:09,512 --> 00:37:11,079
It's been a very long road.

645
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,105
So now, I just really want to get my old life back.

646
00:37:14,755 --> 00:37:17,621
Any y'all need a landscaper, you know who to call.

647
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:23,648
Quite a day.

648
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,739
Quite a story.

649
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:28,180
Um, I'd like to express my gratitude to District Attorney Devalos

650
00:37:28,252 --> 00:37:31,181
for his cooperation and his extraordinary courage

651
00:37:31,263 --> 00:37:34,171
in coming forward with the new evidence which exonerated my client,

652
00:37:34,242 --> 00:37:36,582
despite the fact that he was the lead prosecutor

653
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:39,573
who tried and convicted him in the first place.

654
00:37:44,523 --> 00:37:45,235
Thank you.

655
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:54,199
Congratulations.

656
00:37:54,696 --> 00:37:55,377
Thank you.

657
00:37:55,879 --> 00:37:57,691
Congratulations, man, I'm so happy for you.

658
00:37:57,845 --> 00:37:58,644
I appreciate that.

659
00:37:59,017 --> 00:38:00,805
Congratulations on your exoneration.

660
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:03,510
Thank you for your kind words. You're totally welcome.

661
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:06,104
You're under arrest for the murder of Samantha Robinson.

662
00:38:12,802 --> 00:38:14,266
Look at the gene pool.

663
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:15,565
Oh, I almost forgot something.

664
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:16,750
I'll take her now.

665
00:38:17,091 --> 00:38:18,080
I almost forgot.

666
00:38:18,516 --> 00:38:19,605
Oh, my gosh.

667
00:38:19,908 --> 00:38:20,809
What's this?

668
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:22,462
Happy Mother's Day, Mom.

669
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:25,079
Girls, look at this big box.

670
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:26,548
What's that?

671
00:38:26,953 --> 00:38:28,023
What is this?

672
00:38:28,616 --> 00:38:29,517
Oh, my God.

673
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:31,273
It's a tennis racket.

674
00:38:31,871 --> 00:38:33,748
Wow. Do you even play tennis?

675
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:34,709
Oh, yeah.

676
00:38:34,874 --> 00:38:36,906
I mean, I haven't played since before I met your dad,

677
00:38:36,957 --> 00:38:39,180
but I used to be pretty good, actually.

678
00:38:39,312 --> 00:38:40,936
Thank you, darling.

679
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:45,217
My goodness, this is so different than the kind I used to use.

680
00:38:45,298 --> 00:38:46,526
What made you think of that?

681
00:38:47,433 --> 00:38:48,657
Are there any courts near you?

682
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:51,432
Oh, yeah, at the club. You know, indoor, outdoor, they've got it all.

683
00:38:51,531 --> 00:38:52,768
But frankly...

684
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,232
Frankly, I haven't been there in a while because you feel

685
00:38:57,289 --> 00:38:59,772
so conspicuous being there by yourself, you know.

686
00:38:59,852 --> 00:39:01,917
Well, they must have some sort of round robin program,

687
00:39:01,989 --> 00:39:04,053
something where they partner you up with people.

688
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,167
Oh, sure, I'll bet they do.

689
00:39:06,274 --> 00:39:07,621
Hey, come on, let's see your serve.

690
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:10,176
- No, no, my serve...
- Oh, yeah, yeah!

691
00:39:10,755 --> 00:39:12,521
That's the one thing, really.

692
00:39:13,532 --> 00:39:15,444
I'm not actually a very good server.

693
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,426
Here, how about like this?

694
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:19,260
That's not your serve.

695
00:39:19,347 --> 00:39:21,964
Just take the picture, or I'll show you my backhand!

696
00:39:25,317 --> 00:39:25,975
All right.

697
00:39:26,057 --> 00:39:28,106
Girls. Go get Grandma's bags.

698
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,955
We're going to the airport right after brunch.

699
00:39:34,242 --> 00:39:37,707
Okay, now the coast is clear, um, what is it you want to talk about?

700
00:39:42,909 --> 00:39:44,501
Don't you ever miss the snow?

701
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:45,863
Excuse me?

702
00:39:46,328 --> 00:39:48,227
When are you coming to Grosse Pointe?

703
00:39:48,745 --> 00:39:51,285
I want some of this noise around my house,

704
00:39:51,546 --> 00:39:54,003
and I want some company when I go to the mall.

705
00:39:54,132 --> 00:39:56,743
I want to teach my granddaughters how to play tennis.

706
00:39:57,024 --> 00:39:57,782
Okay.

707
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:01,407
Wait a second.

708
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:11,382
What?

709
00:40:11,965 --> 00:40:14,971
I don't know. You... been poring over the real estate section,

710
00:40:15,048 --> 00:40:18,109
talking about how hard the winter was, how you miss having people around.

711
00:40:18,222 --> 00:40:21,944
I-I got this idea in my head that you might want to...

712
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,695
What?

713
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:27,852
Live out here?

714
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:32,087
Well, you're actually very perceptive.

715
00:40:32,661 --> 00:40:36,173
Okay. I flirted with the idea in my mind.

716
00:40:36,556 --> 00:40:38,471
I don't think Allison suspects,

717
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,596
but the thing is, darling--

718
00:40:40,888 --> 00:40:42,542
and don't be offended-- but...

719
00:40:44,016 --> 00:40:46,797
I like being Grandma, but not all the time.

720
00:40:46,868 --> 00:40:47,722
Not yet.

721
00:40:47,836 --> 00:40:49,654
And I really like being a visitor--

722
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:52,384
at least for now.

723
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:54,712
Are you sure?

724
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,062
Your feelings aren't hurt?

725
00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:08,552
Girls, girls. Come on.

726
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,765
It's okay.

727
00:41:10,057 --> 00:41:12,472
Excellent service at the Hotel Dubois.

728
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:14,666
Okay, everybody to the car!

729
00:41:14,732 --> 00:41:16,090
Do you really have to go, Grandma?

730
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:20,406
Can't you stay here with us and sleep on the magic bed forever and ever?

731
00:41:20,467 --> 00:41:21,812
Grandma has things to do.

732
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,725
I've got to get home and get my house ready for when you folks come visit me.

733
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:37,410
I got it!

734
00:41:41,674 --> 00:41:43,030
Ah, you did okay.

735
00:41:47,245 --> 00:41:48,315
I'm coming!

736
00:41:48,565 --> 00:41:51,177
