00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,700
Previously on Medium:

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,530
Miss Doyle.

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,030
I want to help you develop your
solar cell amplification system.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,590
In exchange for funding,
she wants 51% ownership.

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,750
Do you want to give up
control of your idea?

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,890
- No,of course I don't.
- Then don't.

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,450
I'm sorry,but unless you're
willing to rethink the 51/49 split,

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,230
I don't see how I can do this with you.

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,230
So,how did it go? How'd she take it?

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,200
I signed the papers.

11
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,300
Meghan Doyle.

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,940
So nice to finally meet you.

13
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,830
Yeah,it's nice to finally meet you.

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,040
Well,she's very pretty.

15
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,440
Well,let's try not to
hold that against her.

16
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,170
I just now realized that
I don't have my wallet.

17
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,900
Okay. Miss you.

18
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,690
I thought you were with the boyfriend.

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,960
Best-laid plans...

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,210
Or not laid, as the case may be.

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,500
That is one sharp lunchbox.

22
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,210
No,seriously.

23
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,550
My brother has one
just like it. He's six.

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,140
So,what's your excuse?

25
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,310
Oh,come on,loser.

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,170
You know you want to say
something, so just say it.

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,840
Yeah. Didn't think so.

28
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,630
Damn,kid. You scared me.

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,560
Thought you were Sister Beatrice.

30
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,830
You know if you tell her I'm
out here,you are dead meat.

31
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,470
Kid! I'm talking to you!

32
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,140
No,no...

36
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,320
I don't get it.

37
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,360
I thought these things were
supposed to make me see better,

38
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,850
but all they're doing
is making things fuzzy.

39
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,350
They make Marie see better.

40
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,570
They're prescription. They
only work for her,doofus.

41
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,880
- Give 'em back!
- No.

42
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,050
- Give 'em back!
- No.

43
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,920
Hey,Bridgette,give your
sister her glasses back.

44
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,730
Girls,keep it quiet,okay, 'cause Daddy
had to work late, and he's still asleep.

45
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,140
Hello?

46
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,400
Hey,it's me. I was wondering
how your morning looks.

47
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,800
Uh,I'm just...I'm making my girls
lunch, dropping them off at school,

48
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,450
and then I'm wide open. Why?

49
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,250
Care to lend your considerable
talents to the Phoenix PD?

50
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,360
Oh,really? I didn't think the Phoenix
PD was all that interested in my...

51
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,960
considerable talents these days.

52
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,160
That'd be District Attorney
Van Dyke's policy,not mine.

53
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,900
So what do you say? You
want to meet me for coffee?

54
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,930
Guy's name is Curtis Lambert.

55
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,000
Last night,somebody
snuck into his place.

56
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,560
Shot him three times.

57
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,230
Shot in each kneecap,
and one to the head.

58
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,930
Sounds like whoever wanted to kill this
guy wanted him to suffer before he died.

59
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,480
Lambert made his fortune
bringing heroin into Phoenix.

60
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,830
Our narc squad has been trying to
build a case against him for years.

61
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,190
I'm guessing maybe he got
killed by one of his competitors.

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,260
Has all the hallmarks of
a really expensive hit.

63
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,300
Getting past a top-of-the-line
security system,

64
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,190
leaving a crime scene
that's clean as a whistle.

65
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,020
Not a single fingerprint,
not a drop of DNA.

66
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,370
All right,so,if you know
all this,why'd you call me?

67
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,410
You're not listening to me.

68
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,480
I'm trying to tell you
I don't know anything.

69
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,240
In fact,all I know is what I don't know.

70
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,760
Do me a favor: give the files a
look, see if something clicks for you.

71
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,320
Anything will help. Anything that
will give me a bit of traction.

72
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,100
- You want another one?
- Oh,no,thanks.

73
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,490
No. No,please.

74
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,410
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,410
Okay. All right.

76
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,920
Apology accepted.

77
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,120
Now,would you get out
from behind my desk,please?

78
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,240
I was drunk,Joe. I was excited.

79
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,860
I'm sorry if I did anything
to make you feel uncomfortable.

80
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,430
You're actually making me a little
uncomfortable right now. I'd really...

81
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,180
I'd much prefer it if you would just sit
in your office so I could sit in mine.

82
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,630
Thank you for putting me
in that cab last night.

83
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,440
You're welcome.

84
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,650
I didn't do it for you.

85
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,530
I'm sorry I tried to kiss you.

86
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,300
I-I'm sorry I tried to touch you.

87
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,900
You're not sorry you hit me?

88
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,480
I didn't hit you.

89
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,300
I pushed you. I pushed
you to keep you off me.

90
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,750
Obviously,I misjudged you.

91
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,150
You're a man who loves his marriage.

92
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,570
A man who loves his wife.

93
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,990
You tell her?

94
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,620
No. What am I going to say?

95
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,260
You got drunk and tried to grope me?

96
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,420
Look,Meghan, my family's future
is tied up in this business.

97
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,910
I mean,there's no way that I'm going
to let your stupidity compromise that.

98
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,190
Or my marriage.

99
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,090
Okay. Well,I can see I've totally
blown your trust. I get that.

100
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,810
And I'm going to make
this up to you. You'll see.

101
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,580
I'm going to work twice as hard.

102
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,200
I'm going to line up
banks, big ticket investors.

103
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:33,430
Get us some major R&D money from some
energy contractors I've been cultivating.

104
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,080
You won't regret going into
business with me,Joe. You won't.

105
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,870
- If you say so.
- I do.

106
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,130
Okay. Just do me a favor.
Keep your hands to yourself.

107
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,150
And drink on your own time.

108
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,980
Because if I see you so much
as look at me cross-eyed again,

109
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,190
- I'm gonna take my idea, all my ideas...
- Our ideas.

110
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,690
And I'm out of here. I'll go to a judge.

111
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,750
I'll do whatever has to be done.

112
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,280
Well,let's not get dramatic,Joe.

113
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,580
I mean,it's not going to come to that.

114
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,680
There's too much money to be
made, too much success to be had.

115
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,360
I really am sorry.

116
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,250
You have my word: it won't happen again.

117
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,230
You know,you stare at those too long,
you're gonna burn a hole through them.

118
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,530
I'm serious. I'm a scientist.
I know these things.

119
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,430
Sorry. I was trying to help
Lee a little; that's all.

120
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,970
So,how are things going at
Dubois-Doyle Enterprises,LLC?

121
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,000
It's kind of weird.

122
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,250
You're finally back to work, and you seem
to have almost nothing to say about it.

123
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,630
Well,there's not a lot to say.

124
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,860
What about Meghan? How's
it to work with her?

125
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,650
Oh,I don't know,Al. I
just go to my office,

126
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,550
and I try to figure out how to turn
my idea from something that's on paper

127
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,970
into something that we
can show business people.

128
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,480
You know,a model, a presentation.

129
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:19,120
She's in her office talking
to lawyers and bankers and...

130
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,820
You know, it's all very exciting.

131
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,310
Hey,when are we gonna have
that dinner we talked about?

132
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,920
What are you talking about?

133
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:34,170
That dinner that we all talked
about last week. You,me,Meghan.

134
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,570
- Oh,God.
- Whoever she wants to bring.

135
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,420
Honestly? I don't know,Al.

136
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,760
My sense is that Meghan has
a pretty active social life.

137
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,750
It may be a while before
she can squeeze us in.

138
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,230
Really? 'Cause I got the feeling that
she was really looking forward to it.

139
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,910
Yeah?

140
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,440
Well,she can be pretty
hard to read sometimes.

141
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,550
You're not actually going to
light that in here,are you?

142
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,230
So you gonna holster that or what?

143
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,190
Wait. Don't tell me.

144
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,510
This is the part where I'm supposed to
say you're good with your hands,right?

145
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,310
Baby,you have no idea.

146
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,760
Well,that's not something
you see much of anymore.

147
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,880
What's that?

148
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,810
A doctor who smokes.

149
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,220
Sagemont Hospital,
Physical Rehabilitation.

150
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,200
You're a doctor,right?

151
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,550
'Cause that would
certainly explain the ego.

152
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,600
You don't have to be a
doctor to have an ego,dear.

153
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,540
You just have to be good.

154
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,260
It's been a long time,Curtis.

155
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,280
Yeah... I'd be surprised to see me,too.

156
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,280
All right,one more
time for the slow kid.

157
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,670
I don't know if he's a therapist
or a hospital administrator,

158
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,080
but he definitely works here.

159
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,580
Late 40s. I'm guessing like your height.

160
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:34,740
Not great-looking,but he
has a way with the ladies.

161
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,040
Oh,and he's really good with his hands.

162
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,060
I saw him,uh, do this magic trick.

163
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,820
And that bartender that he was hitting on,
she was at least 20 years younger than he was.

164
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,290
So...

165
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,270
he certainly doesn't
lack for confidence.

166
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,240
That's for sure.

167
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,450
And there he is.

168
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,610
Sir?

169
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,390
Detective Lee Scanlon. This is
my associate, Allison Dubois.

170
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,630
We were wondering if we
could ask you a few questions.

171
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,160
I'll take that as a "yes."

172
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,290
Let's start with your name.

173
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,080
Joey. Joey Carmichael.

174
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,610
Tell me,Joey, you know someone
by the name of Curtis Lambert?

175
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,410
No. Why do you want to know?

176
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,440
Somebody broke into his house two
nights ago, shot him three times.

177
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,380
Now he's dead.

178
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,730
That's terrible.

179
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,260
Yeah,well, the thing of it is,Joey,

180
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,450
I was wondering if you could account
for your whereabouts two nights ago.

181
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,670
Wait a minute. I don't understand.
Am I in trouble for something?

182
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,910
That's what we're here to find out.

183
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,020
- Are these two friends of yours,Joey?
- No,they work for the police.

184
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,060
They think that I hurt
somebody called Curtis Lambert.

185
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,640
No. I'm...

186
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,310
I'm sorry, do you mean Curtis
Lambert, the drug dealer?

187
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,190
The guy they've been talking about
on TV for the last couple days?

188
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,450
Yeah,I'm the lead
investigator on the case.

189
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,940
We're here to follow up on a tip that
Mr. Carmichael might have been involved.

190
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,820
- I never hurt anybody.
- I know,I know.

191
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:05,010
Why don't you go ahead and
get started on your exercises?

192
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,440
I need a few minutes to
talk to these people. Okay?

193
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,610
Look,if this is some sort of joke...

194
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,580
This isn't a joke,ma'am.
Your friend Joey over there...

195
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,970
is a person of interest.

196
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,300
Didn't they say that this Curtis
Lambert was shot? With a gun?

197
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,880
That they broke into his house and
did something with his burglar alarm?

198
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,240
Yeah,that's right.

199
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:31,480
Well,I'm that man's therapist and I can tell you
Joey Carmichael hasn't had full use of his hands--

200
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,330
much less a lot of his brain--
for more than four years now.

201
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,590
That's why he comes here.

202
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,900
See,that man there...
that's a walking miracle.

203
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,630
Shot in the head and left for dead.

204
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,230
Bullet's still in his brain.

205
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,810
I mean,you can go and
talk to him if you want,

206
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,970
but you'll see he has
the mind of a 12-year-old.

207
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,750
Okay,decision time.

208
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,960
Garbage or Bridgette's lunch tomorrow?

209
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,760
Come on,focus. Garbage pail or
Bridgette's belly? The clock is ticking.

210
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,830
Garbage.

211
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,840
Fine.

212
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,370
But Bridgette told me to tell you you've
got no shot for mother of the year.

213
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,880
Someone's in a mood.

214
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,150
It was a tough, embarrassing day.

215
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,620
Embarrassing? Really?
You talking about Scanlon?

216
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,600
Come on,Al,he's been
to this dance before.

217
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,000
He knows that what you
do isn't an exact science.

218
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,450
Joe,I spent half the day trying to lead
him to a high-end professional killer.

219
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,410
When we get there,the guy's
got a bullet in his brain

220
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,860
and looks like he can
barely turn a doorknob.

221
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,600
Okay. I give you permission
to be embarrassed.

222
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,490
If you do it in the bedroom,in
bed. With your eyes closed.

223
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,450
For the last time: Stop
with the stupid crying.

224
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,730
I mean it.

225
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
Embarrassing yourself is one thing.

226
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,080
Embarrassing me is another.

227
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,840
You didn't have to do what you did.

228
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,000
You didn't have to beat that kid up.

229
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,540
Are you kidding me?

230
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,120
After what he did to you?

231
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,190
He's lucky I didn't break
more than just his jaw.

232
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,710
Please.

233
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,340
Let me tell the principal I did it.

234
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,110
I mean...

235
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
who's to say it wasn't me?

236
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,550
Me. I say it wasn't you.

237
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,810
Look... I'm sorry.

238
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,600
I know I'm only three minutes older,
but that still makes me the big brother.

239
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,980
That means I look out for you.

240
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,770
Not the other way around.

241
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,030
You.

242
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,690
You're not supposed to be
here, only your brother.

243
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,620
Joey Carmichael, if you don't go
back to class this very instant...

244
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,290
Joey Carmichael.

245
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,750
I think he has a twin.

246
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,430
- Who's got a twin?
- Joey Carmichael.

247
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,310
He's got a brother who
looks just like him.

248
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,520
Okay,here we go.

249
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,950
Theodore Carmichael,
born 9-19-61.

250
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,960
- B and E specialist, by the looks of it.
- "B and E"?

251
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,990
Breaking and entering.

252
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,810
According to this,he started with a few
smash-and-grabs in his formative years,

253
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,050
then graduated to more sophisticated
break-ins in the '80s and '90s.

254
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,930
Main suspect in a jewelry store
burglary in '04, but never convicted.

255
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,550
Guy like this could've gotten by Curtis
Lambert's alarm system in his sleep.

256
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,130
You think maybe I'm right, that this is
the man I saw murder Lambert in my dreams?

257
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,590
I'll put it to you this way:

258
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:43,190
I'd sure as hell like to know
where he was three nights ago.

259
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,100
You are so bad.

260
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,030
Oh,sorry,I didn't realize you
were in the middle of something.

261
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,690
No,no,no. This is good.

262
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,990
I'll bet your ears were burning.

263
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,860
Terry,this Joe Dubois, the
genius I was telling you about.

264
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,640
- Joe
- Hello.

265
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,170
this is Terry Cavanaugh.

266
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,480
Terry's the owner of
Stratosphere Aeronautics.

267
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,170
Pleased to meet you,Joe.

268
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,330
Meghan was just telling me
all about your new venture.

269
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,970
It all sounds promising. Very promising.

270
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,010
Well,we're certainly excited.

271
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,710
Well,if you'll excuse me.
I've got a plane to catch.

272
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,700
I'm sure I'll be
talking to you both soon.

273
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,630
Great presentation, little lady.

274
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,170
You have my undivided attention.

275
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,420
Mr. Dubois.

276
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,330
What was that? Who was that?

277
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,690
That? That's the John D.
Rockefeller of solar energy.

278
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,420
That's the man with the deepest pockets in
the world when it comes to alternative fuels.

279
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,430
And he's smitten with you,Joe.

280
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,470
Your ideas.

281
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,000
I told you I was going
to work twice as hard.

282
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,760
I told you I was going
to make it up to you.

283
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,620
I don't understand.

284
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,990
If he's as important as you say
he is, then what's he doing here?

285
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,900
Why is he coming to us?

286
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,880
Terry and I go way back.

287
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,800
We did a lot of business together
when I was at Buchanon-Lockhart.

288
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,830
I just found out that he
was in town this morning

289
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,230
and that he had a 30-minute
window before he had to fly home.

290
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,250
Say... "Nice work,Meghan."

291
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,950
Haven't you ever made a mistake?

292
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:42,320
Haven't you ever done
something reckless...

293
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,000
or stupid...

294
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:48,370
and then had to go back to people who
were important to you and say "I'm sorry"?

295
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,500
"Give me another chance"?

296
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,220
That was Terry Cavanaugh.

297
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,910
I don't know how to do better than that.

298
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,900
Nice work,Meghan.

299
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,090
Shh,shh,keep it down. Keep it down.

300
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,890
- It took me half an hour to get the girls to sleep.
- Sorry.

301
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,200
I've never seen a man so happy
about working late every night.

302
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,360
What's going on over
there at Dubois-Doyle?

303
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,060
Any extra employee benefits
you want to tell me about?

304
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,510
Actually,I think that today
we sort of turned a corner.

305
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,440
Earlier in the week, I wasn't so sure.

306
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,080
- What do you mean?
- Oh,I don't know.

307
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,750
I think for a while there I was just worried
that we weren't going to be the great team

308
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,070
that I imagined we would be.

309
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,430
And then today...

310
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,660
I don't know, we were both,like,
firing on all cylinders.

311
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,930
She brought in this,like, alternative
energy big shot and he really liked my stuff.

312
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,870
And I made some really, really good
headway on the design for the prototype.

313
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,730
I don't know,I think I just caught
a glimpse of our future again...

314
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,530
and I liked what I saw.

315
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,370
I know how difficult...

316
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,930
I got to leave town,Joey.

317
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,810
I don't know when I'll be
back. It could be a while.

318
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,910
Actually,it could be long while,but...

319
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,640
I didn't want to take off
without saying good-bye. So, bye.

320
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,320
- What the hell have you gotten yourself into now,Teddy?
- Nothing.

321
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,850
Just not seeing eye-to-eye
with some business partners.

322
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,110
And it's a little misunderstanding.
I mean,everything's gonna be fine.

323
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,430
I promise. Seriously.

324
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,640
Hey,Teddy.

325
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,750
I've been looking for you all night.

326
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,170
What the hell's going
on,Teddy? Who is this guy?

327
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,360
- Marty,I can explain.
- Not to me.

328
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,730
Curtis wants to talk to you right now.

329
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,110
I'm not going to give
you any trouble. Just...

330
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,740
just do me a favor, okay? Leave my
brother out of this. He didn't do anything.

331
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,540
I wish I could do
that,Teddy. I really do.

332
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,060
No. What,wait! No!

333
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,470
How do you like that,Teddy?

334
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,160
You don't have any
witty comebacks now,huh?

335
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,140
Why did you shoot my brother? You
didn't... you didn't have to do that.

336
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,320
What you blaming us for,man?

337
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,910
You should be looking at yourself.

338
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:10,310
The minute you tried to leave town with my
money, you put everybody you love in danger.

339
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,180
Joey didn't know anything about this.

340
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,450
It doesn't matter.

341
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:21,280
You know what? I'm
bored with this. End it.

342
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,570
Oh,sorry.

343
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,860
So,now you're telling me you
think Teddy Carmichael's dead.

344
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,540
Teddy was executed by the same
man who shot Joey in the head,

345
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,260
a man who worked for Curtis Lambert.

346
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,760
In fact,it happened the
same night back in 2004.

347
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,240
According to the file, Joey was shot during
a routine robbery attempt at his apartment.

348
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,340
There's nothing about his
brother being executed in here.

349
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,850
This was no routine robbery.

350
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,680
The man who shot Joey used a silencer.

351
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,970
Look at the file. Not one of his
neighbors reported hearing a gunshot.

352
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,390
Fine. No one heard the gunshot. It wouldn't
be the first time. That proves nothing.

353
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,570
- What's your point?
- I don't know.

354
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,130
It's not really about a point.

355
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,060
I'm just telling you what I know. I'm
just telling you what I saw. I'm just...

356
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,320
I'm trying to help you,Lee.

357
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,410
I appreciate that,Allison,
but honestly...

358
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,590
right now you're just confusing me.

359
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,050
Two nights ago you saw Teddy
Carmichael kill Curtis Lambert.

360
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,420
Last night you saw someone who
worked for Curtis kill Teddy.

361
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,540
Obviously,one of your dreams was wrong.

362
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,670
That means the only thing for me to do
is focus on the things I know for certain.

363
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,350
I got Curtis Lambert's
body in the morgue,

364
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,060
and I have a suspect
in Teddy Carmichael,

365
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,590
a man who,as far as the official
record's concerned, is very much alive.

366
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,890
And I'm gonna keep looking for him
until I find out otherwise. In fact...

367
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,200
I'm on my way over to see his brother
Joey about that very thing right now.

368
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,290
If you want to come.

369
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,090
I don't understand.

370
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,990
You're saying you think Teddy
might have hurt this guy?

371
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,600
We'd like to ask him some questions.

372
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,770
Well, my brother had
nothing to do with this.

373
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,700
He couldn't have. Teddy
lives in Miami now.

374
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:57,060
If he was coming to
town, he would've told me.

375
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,590
Do you mind if I help?

376
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,440
Yeah,thanks.

377
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,470
Miami? Do you have a phone
number for him? Or an address?

378
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,480
No. He moves around a lot.

379
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,650
When did Teddy move to Miami?

380
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,270
It was a few years ago.

381
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,170
it was right around the
time that I got hurt.

382
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,230
Can you think of the last time that you
actually saw your brother since that night?

383
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,260
He hasn't come to visit for a long time.

384
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,370
Joey,I don't mean to pry.

385
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,580
Can you remember anything about
the night that you were attacked?

386
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,210
Can you remember if Teddy was there?

387
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,190
I don't remember
anything about that day.

388
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,380
My doctor says I probably never will.

389
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,660
Well,that's okay,Joey.

390
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,440
I'm just confused about one thing.

391
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,690
You said you don't have a
phone number for your brother.

392
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,750
Then how do the two
of you keep in touch?

393
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,210
He calls me a couple
times a week at least.

394
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,250
I mean,I just got a
message from him yesterday.

395
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,650
- Can we hear it?
- Yeah.

396
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,900
Hey,kid,it's your big brother.

397
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:08,050
Listen,don't get nervous if your check's
a day or two late this month,okay?

398
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,720
There's a bank holiday this week.

399
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,560
So,your doctors told me
you're doing great in rehab.

400
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,520
I'm really proud of you.

401
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,860
I'll check in with you in a
couple days,all right? Bye.

402
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,210
Teddy looks out for me.

403
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,580
He always has.

404
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,050
Hey,family guy. It's after 6:00.
When are you getting out of here?

405
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,980
Is it really?

406
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:38,010
My God,I swear, a
minute ago it was 3:30.

407
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,930
I must like this job.

408
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,990
Well,that makes two of us.

409
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,900
So,good news. Terry Cavanaugh
invited me to come to Albuquerque.

410
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,540
Meet some of their
senior people tomorrow.

411
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,050
I'm flying out first
thing in the morning.

412
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,930
I think they're contemplating
making a major investment.

413
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,840
He really liked what he heard.

414
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,160
You know I'm really starting to
resent this good mood of yours.

415
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,570
Hey,isn't it nice that somebody in
this house is happy in their work?

416
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,720
Besides,I like being
able to pay our bills.

417
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,200
Well,that's great, Mr. Sunshine.

418
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,700
Why don't you shut off
the light and go to bed.

419
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,710
I find all this good cheer depressing.

420
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,070
Now listen, I know this Scanlon
thing has got you frustrated.

421
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:29,650
And I know that this case got you all confused,
but I think you're looking at this all wrong.

422
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:33,800
I mean,you ever stop for a minute and, and think
about this from the brother's point of view?

423
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,820
What are you talking about? I have
no idea what you're talking about.

424
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,320
The brother. The one
that you thought was dead?

425
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,260
I mean,I know that you're
upset to hear that he's alive,

426
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,550
but it's got to be good news to him.

427
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,860
Is this a joke?

428
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,140
Is that what we're doing now? Jokes?

429
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,760
Oh,I'm sorry. I didn't know it
was time for the supper show.

430
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,910
If I did,I would have made sure to
turn the ringer off on my cell phone.

431
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,170
You didn't think that was funny?

432
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,490
'Cause I'm just trying to cheer you up.

433
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,910
you know they say a
good mood is contagious.

434
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,450
Yeah,you know what I say? They're wrong.

435
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,730
All right. Love you.

436
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,640
Yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah.

437
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,800
Keep it to yourself.

438
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,760
That better not be Coffee
Crunch you're eating.

439
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,780
You know Coffee Crunch keeps you awake.

440
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:32,440
Come on,Joey,put down the
ice cream and go to sleep.

441
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,120
You're not going to be at your
best until you fall asleep.

442
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,650
That's it.

443
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,720
Off to dreamland,kiddo. Let your
big brother drive for a while.

444
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:30,380
You've reached Joey Carmichael.
Please leave me a message.

445
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,840
Hey,Joey. It's Teddy.

446
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:36,640
Just wanted you to know, I'm gonna put a
little something extra in this month's check.

447
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,750
I know our birthday is
coming up, **********

448
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,940
I'm sorry I'm late.

449
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,840
Got tied up talking to the Miami PD.

450
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,990
Teddy Carmichael doesn't have
a registered address there,

451
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,800
but they're going to run his known
aliases and see what turns up.

452
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:00,190
I get a feeling no matter how hard they
try, Miami PD isn't going to find him.

453
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,610
You said to me the other day
one of my dreams had to be wrong.

454
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,280
Well,I'm starting to think
that both my dreams were right.

455
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,310
Teddy Carmichael is dead.

456
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,230
And he did kill Curtis Lambert.

457
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,100
You aren't saying anything.

458
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,190
What's there to say?

459
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,450
Come on,you've heard those
crazy stories about twins.

460
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,700
How some lady in
Poughkeepsie knows immediately

461
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,010
that her sister in Grand
Rapids got hit by a bus.

462
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,640
Or how they finish
each other's sentences?

463
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:29,650
Or how some of them speak in some
secret language when they're kids?

464
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:34,310
And now Teddy is using it to control
his brother to,I don't know...

465
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,370
possess him.

466
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,400
Are you telling me that's
how he killed Curtis Lambert?

467
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,270
I think that's how he
does a lot of things.

468
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,660
I think that's how he
pays Joey's medical bills.

469
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,120
That's how he leaves him messages
to let him know he's okay.

470
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,660
What are you thinking?

471
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,610
I think I'm thinking what
you'd expect me to be thinking.

472
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,770
I'm sorry,Allison. I know you want
to help, but right now, to be honest,

473
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,850
we're spending time I don't
have on theories I can't use.

474
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,200
But I do appreciate it.

475
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,490
- I got it. I got it.
- Whatever.

476
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,070
Hello?

477
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,170
Okay,psychic lady,
guess what I'm thinking?

478
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,080
You're thinking...
"Oh,it's almost dinnertime.

479
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,510
I'm not home yet. Maybe
I should call my wife."

480
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,700
It's amazing how you do that.

481
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,440
Thing is I'm having kind
of a breakthrough here.

482
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,980
Oh,really?

483
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,260
You ever notice how you always have
a breakthrough when it's time to,

484
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:30,840
uh,feed a child, or bathe a
child or put a child to bed?

485
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,170
Is that true?

486
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,200
Hey,maybe,uh,I should always have a
dirty,hungry, or sleepy child around.

487
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,000
Imagine the new frontiers
I'd be able to conquer. Sorry.

488
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,110
Oh,it's okay. It'll
be my turn one night.

489
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,070
You don't want to do that.

490
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,170
The food'll just sit
in your gut all night.

491
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,810
You'll never get back to sleep.

492
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,430
Sorry if I frightened you.

493
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,230
What do you want?

494
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,010
I want to make you a proposition.

495
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,440
What kind of proposition?

496
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,120
You stop telling people
about my brother and me,

497
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,050
about how I can do whaI
do, and I'll stop doing it.

498
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,000
What are you saying? You're
planning on doing more?

499
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:31,570
You already killed the man who ordered your
brother's attack, who ordered your execution.

500
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,990
But not the man who pulled
the trigger. Not yet.

501
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,380
So,what do you say?

502
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,400
You stop trying to convince
the police about Joey and me,

503
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:45,300
and I'll give you my word
nothing will happen to that guy.

504
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,450
I don't believe you.
You are... you're...

505
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,980
you're filled with anger.

506
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,100
You are filled with vengeance.

507
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,910
I can... I can feel it from here.

508
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,730
I never said there wouldn't be vengeance.
I just said I wouldn't kill him.

509
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,350
You're going to send him to jail for me.

510
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,630
For the rest of his life.

511
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,580
I am? For what?

512
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,630
For murdering me,of course.

513
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,860
After he shot me that
night, he buried me.

514
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,230
I can show you exactly where.

515
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,520
You dig me up,you're going
to find bullets in my body

516
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:26,320
that match the gun
that he's still using.

517
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:31,630
So do we have a deal, Mrs. Dubois?

518
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,240
That's my husband.

519
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,890
What are you doing up at this hour?

520
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:47,170
Uh,just... I couldn't sleep.

521
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,190
Missed me,huh?

522
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,810
Well,don't worry. You'll sleep.

523
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,670
I'm tired enough for the two of us.

524
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,080
I'll be right in.

525
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,700
Teddy,if you can hear me...I'm in.

526
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,170
I don't understand.

527
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,920
This can't be Teddy.
That's... That's not Teddy.

528
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:24,560
I'm sorry,Mr. Carmichael,
but that is your brother.

529
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,170
But he calls me, sends
me money every month.

530
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,750
But he doesn't really call you.

531
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,440
I mean,think about it.

532
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:35,460
You haven't had a real
conversation in a very long time.

533
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,300
He leaves you messages,recordings.

534
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:43,070
Joey, your brother loved you very much.

535
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,310
But given the kind of
life that he was leading,

536
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,420
we think that he knew something
was about to happen to him.

537
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:57,090
So he... he put a system into
place-- the checks, the recordings--

538
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:01,340
to take care of you in
case the worst happened.

539
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,740
I'm sure this is of little
comfort to you at this moment,

540
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,250
Mr. Carmichael, but we do
have a suspect in custody.

541
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,280
His name's Martin Gibbons.

542
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:13,520
He worked for a man
named Curtis Lambert.

543
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:18,520
We have very strong evidence to believe
that he's the man who may have killed Teddy.

544
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:24,160
He always looked after me, you know?

545
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:29,270
Who's going to look after me now?

546
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,810
"Sorry we keep missing each other,
"though I suspect I miss you more.

547
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,870
"Terry Cavanaugh is a true believer
"and that has made me realize

548
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,360
"that we are not just
each other's futures...

549
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,850
"we are each other's destinies.

550
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,090
Back soon. Meghan."

551
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,250
Has anyone seen Princess Marie?

552
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,790
I'm looking everywhere for her.

553
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,940
I've come to rescue her.

554
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,820
I'm right here.

555
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,190
Hang on a second.

556
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,630
Uh,I will return to rescue you after
I talk to the dragon on the phone.

557
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,780
Hello?

558
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,950
Sorry to bother you at home,Allison,

559
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,040
but I wanted you to hear this
before it landed on the evening news.

560
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,800
Martin Gibbons was released a
half an hour ago; he made bail.

561
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:21,330
I thought the bullets in
Teddy's corpse matched his gun.

562
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,680
The preliminary tests say they do,

563
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,680
but we won't have the final
results for about a day

564
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,130
and his lawyer was able
to leverage that for bail.

565
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,930
I'm no happier about this guy sleeping
in his own bed tonight than you are,

566
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,330
but believe me, this
case is as good as closed.

567
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,820
We are going to put this guy away.

568
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,750
Well,I hope you do it soon.

569
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:40,500
I gave my word to someone that Gibbons
was going to get what he deserves.

570
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,730
- Why are frogs so happy?
- I don't know.

571
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,880
'Cause they eat whatever bugs them.

572
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:49,400
- Why did the frog say "meow"?
- I don't know.

573
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,870
He was learning a foreign language.

574
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640
Mm,hey, you're just in time.

575
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,220
Let me get you a plate.

576
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,470
I need to speak to you.

577
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,460
What is this? What am I looking
at? Why are you showing me this?

578
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,250
It's from Meghan.

579
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:15,010
It's a robe. It's a cashmere robe.

580
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,210
I called the store. It cost $2,200.

581
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,400
I don't care how much it costs.
What is she doing buying you a robe?

582
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,090
I don't know.

583
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,170
Uh,I can't reach her,Allison.
I think she's on a plane.

584
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,760
Yeah? Well, I hope it crashes.

585
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,840
Now,listen, Allison...

586
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,700
And what do you mean "you don't know"?

587
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,720
You're telling me you just work with
someone every day and then suddenly,

588
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:37,930
out of nowhere,out of the blue,
they buy you a $2,200 robe?

589
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,570
Well,hold on. Hold on a second. Wait.

590
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:44,100
Come on,I swear to God,
there's nothing going on.

591
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,190
All right,it's crazy. She's crazy!

592
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,830
The other night I'm working
in my office, late,on my own,

593
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,060
and she walks in,she's
all drunk off her ass,

594
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,620
she leaves her boyfriend
to tell me that...

595
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,710
The patent is clear. I know!

596
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,980
I don't want to hear it!
I don't need to hear it!

597
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,740
I already dreamt it! I saw it all!

598
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,260
You did? Then why didn't you tell me?

599
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,890
No! That is not the question!

600
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,870
The question is why didn't you tell me?

601
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,230
When it happened, why
didn't you tell me?

602
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,940
Oh,jeez.

603
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,490
For a minute there I thought
I was looking at a ghost.

604
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,540
I remember you now.

605
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,630
You're Teddy's brother,right?

606
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,630
Well,listen, I don't know what
you've been hearing on the news,

607
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,290
but I had nothing to do with
what happened to your brother.

608
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,340
He was a good guy. I liked Teddy.

609
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:56,920
So,Joey,you just gonna stand there all
night, or you actually have something to say?

610
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,010
Lee.

611
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,790
You already heard,huh?

612
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,610
Guess he wasn't too happy about
his brother's killer making bail.

613
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,130
Did you talk to him?

614
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,160
No,I tried, but he wouldn't say a word.

615
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,200
Honestly,we don't really need
him to answer our questions.

616
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:32,290
He did what he did in front of a
restaurant full of eyewitnesses.

617
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,700
I should be going,Allison.
Let's talk in the morning,okay?

618
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:44,010
You're upset, aren't you?

619
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,410
Don't be.

620
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,440
Oh,don't be upset? You
want me to not be upset?

621
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,160
Then why did you do it?

622
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,830
I'm afraid you're mistaken, Mrs.
Dubois. I didn't do anything.

623
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,350
What happened at that
restaurant tonight was all Joey.

624
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,110
I-I didn't have anything to do with it.

625
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,000
I don't believe you. You're lying.

626
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,180
I wish I was.

627
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:10,740
I guess Joey thought that he
was looking out for me this time.

628
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:14,480
Listen,I've to go, but like I
said, you don't have to be upset.

629
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,760
Truth is, Joey's not going to spend one
single second in prison, I promise you.

630
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,770
What are you talking about?

631
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,720
I'm going to take over.

632
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:25,470
Do his stretch in prison. Keep him safe.

633
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,320
When he finally gets out,it'll
be like he took a long nap.

634
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,900
That's very nice.

635
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,950
We're talking about murder.

636
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,400
What if he gets life?

637
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,940
That's not gonna happen.

638
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,360
You see,Joey killed the
man who killed his brother.

639
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,160
A jury's bound to have
some sympathy for that.

640
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,900
And besides,when they get
a look at his condition...

641
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,790
let's just say I think the
court's gonna be merciful.

642
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,430
Do you think that...

643
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,560
or do you know that?

644
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:59,430
Nancy Fong is live at the scene
as murder suspect Joseph Carmichael

645
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,230
is transferred to McCarren
State Penitentiary,

646
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,740
where he'll await arraignment.

647
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,120
Mr. Carmichael,rumor has it that the district
attorney is planning to seek the maximum sentence.

648
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,780
Do you have a comment?

649
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,790
Well,honestly, I'm not
so scared of prison.

650
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,050
I think it'll be just
like taking a long nap.

651
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,570
Please don't wake the girls.

652
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,970
I don't know how much you dreamt...

653
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,080
I don't know what you saw...

654
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,570
but nothing happened.

655
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,760
I wouldn't let anything happen.

656
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,070
I could never let anything happen.

657
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,660
You are everything to me.

658
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:15,070
I'm going to go in there in the morning.
I'm going to tell her there's no company.

659
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:17,890
Not with me in it.

660
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,030
I'll have another idea.
I'll find another partner.

661
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,350
Best-laid plans,huh?
