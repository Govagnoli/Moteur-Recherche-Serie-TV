1
00:00:00,642 --> 00:00:02,017
Mommy!

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:05,425
Mommy!

3
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:11,504
Mommy!

4
00:00:17,505 --> 00:00:20,105
- Mommy!
- Ariel?

5
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:24,551
Ariel, where are you?

6
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:28,851
Ariel, talk to Mommy.

7
00:00:28,923 --> 00:00:31,359
- Mommy!
- Where are you?

8
00:00:32,804 --> 00:00:33,920
Ariel?!

9
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:38,948
Joe?

10
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:42,624
Allison, Joe's not here.

11
00:00:44,887 --> 00:00:45,870
Who are you?

12
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:47,867
Where's Ariel?

13
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,481
You know me.

14
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:54,841
I'm the golem.

15
00:00:57,211 --> 00:00:58,332
I'm the devil.

16
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:01,189
I'm a monster.

17
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:04,952
And your little girl?

18
00:01:06,324 --> 00:01:07,947
She's in the trunk of my car.

19
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:11,496
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've come back to get the other ones...

20
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:13,478
No! No!

21
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:22,631
I need you awake.

22
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:25,965
I can do awake. Just give me a couple of hours.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,232
- Joe.
- Okay, okay, I'm awake.

24
00:01:30,235 --> 00:01:33,169
I'm awake, mostly. What's going on, bad dream?

25
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:35,391
Yeah. No.

26
00:01:36,318 --> 00:01:37,563
Did you hear that?

27
00:01:38,002 --> 00:01:40,244
- Mommy!
- It's Ariel!

28
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:43,844
I'll check on Marie.

29
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,175
- She's okay.
- Mommy!

30
00:01:53,992 --> 00:01:55,451
Mommy!

31
00:01:56,724 --> 00:02:00,239
Tell me, darling, was there a doll in this dream?

32
00:02:01,114 --> 00:02:03,106
Other than you, you mean?

33
00:02:04,242 --> 00:02:08,411
Okay. And Saturday Ariel has a soccer game, so...

34
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:10,186
we have to pick up snacks.

35
00:02:10,903 --> 00:02:11,912
Again?

36
00:02:13,704 --> 00:02:17,995
Okay, fine, just... this time let's bring something good.

37
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:21,000
No fruit, you know? I felt like an idiot last time.

38
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:24,048
If you want to feed growing girls grease and sugar,

39
00:02:24,108 --> 00:02:26,330
then you could stop by the market and pick it up yourself.

40
00:02:26,403 --> 00:02:26,986
Fine.

41
00:02:30,556 --> 00:02:32,192
Isn't this always the case?

42
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:36,002
I'm finally tired enough to go back to sleep, and the sun's coming up.

43
00:02:36,602 --> 00:02:37,851
Wait a second.

44
00:02:38,111 --> 00:02:39,269
Just wait a second.

45
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:40,539
What's the matter, you miss something?

46
00:02:41,184 --> 00:02:42,434
You could say that.

47
00:02:42,756 --> 00:02:44,097
I'm a week late.

48
00:02:44,226 --> 00:02:45,321
Late for what?

49
00:02:47,555 --> 00:02:49,207
Oh, you're that kind of late?

50
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:51,640
Late late?

51
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:54,179
Yeah, Joe, a week late.

52
00:02:54,352 --> 00:02:55,413
Late late.

53
00:02:56,897 --> 00:02:59,815
Well. Guess I'm awake now.

54
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:49,778
You know what, when you stop and think about it, I think it's kind of neat.

55
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:52,122
Or at least it could be, if it actually happened.

56
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:53,593
If what actually happened?

57
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:55,978
- Nothing.
- Nothing. Neat?

58
00:03:56,213 --> 00:03:59,911
Yeah. We've been to this barbecue a couple times before-- we know what to expect.

59
00:04:00,612 --> 00:04:02,961
It's not like you're in it alone. I'll help.

60
00:04:03,136 --> 00:04:06,182
Oh. You'll help-- oh, that's great.

61
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,154
I'll tell you what.

62
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,305
I'll gain the 60 pounds this time,

63
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:11,640
but you can have the hemorrhoids and the swollen ankles,

64
00:04:11,696 --> 00:04:13,760
'cause that  would be really helpful-- that would be neat.

65
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:16,196
- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

66
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:19,109
And while you're at it, maybe you could take three months off from work

67
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:21,087
- so you could stay home and breast-feed.
- Very funny.

68
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,685
- Mommy!
- What?

69
00:04:23,523 --> 00:04:25,064
Mommy said "breast."

70
00:04:25,342 --> 00:04:26,913
All right, I'm sorry I said anything.

71
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:28,024
Me, too.

72
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:32,714
So where does all this giddy good cheer come from?

73
00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:36,477
You suddenly like your cars filled with sticky car seats?

74
00:04:36,683 --> 00:04:40,240
You've grown accustomed to waking up early on Sunday mornings and not having sex?

75
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:45,601
You're hooked on the smell of ripe diapers and you're worried it's gonna end sometime soon?

76
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:50,148
- Talk to me.
- I don't have anything to say.

77
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:52,785
I was feeling good about the possibility, but you've made me see

78
00:04:52,846 --> 00:04:54,909
the error of my ways and I've changed my mind.

79
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:58,970
Liar. You think I'm mean and selfish and unromantic and...

80
00:04:59,047 --> 00:05:00,434
Why do you ask me questions?

81
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:02,682
If you think you know what I'm thinking,

82
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:04,488
why put me through the trouble of answering?

83
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:09,829
Look, I want to have a little boy, too. Maybe not right this second, but...

84
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:11,094
Is that what you think this is about?

85
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,512
Did you finish your math homework?

86
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:17,668
Most of it.

87
00:05:18,094 --> 00:05:19,858
Most of it is not all of it.

88
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:23,224
You know you're not gonna get better if you don't work on the problems you can't solve.

89
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:27,028
- I know, I know.
- Ariel didn't finish her math homework.

90
00:05:27,325 --> 00:05:28,287
Ariel...

91
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,598
Don't be mad.

92
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:31,247
I just don't like it.

93
00:05:31,503 --> 00:05:34,492
Don't like math? But math is the best!

94
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:38,958
Daddy should know-- math is how he makes his living.

95
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,352
I thought you were an aerospace engineer.

96
00:05:41,451 --> 00:05:42,449
Oh, boy.

97
00:05:42,914 --> 00:05:45,434
What is it you think an aerospace engineer does, honey?

98
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:47,087
I don't know.

99
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:49,322
What?

100
00:05:49,414 --> 00:05:52,383
Okay, you and me, tonight, by the kitchen table.

101
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,606
What are you talking about?

102
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:55,163
Dad's gonna tutor you in math.

103
00:05:55,653 --> 00:05:59,821
- Oh, no, no, please, no. No! No!
- Yes, oh, yes. Everybody in the car.

104
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:02,361
Oh, please, no? Oh, great.

105
00:06:02,657 --> 00:06:05,234
About earlier-- I am excited.

106
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:06,887
I'll get excited.

107
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,914
And I will stay home and breast-feed. You'll see.

108
00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:12,427
You know, before anyone gets too excited,

109
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,858
we should make sure it's really, you know, happening.

110
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:17,664
What, you're not gonna pee on a stick for me, too?

111
00:06:20,517 --> 00:06:22,980
I'll pick up a pregnancy test at lunch!

112
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:25,095
Bring it home. I'm good at tests.

113
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:29,818
- You made my job very easy.
- Well, that's nice of you to say.

114
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:35,493
- Thank you again for all your help, Mr. Swanstrom.
- My pleasure. I'm just glad I could help.

115
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,126
- Hey, Allison.
- Hey.

116
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:41,345
Going down?

117
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,250
No. Thank you.

118
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:46,372
- Okay. See you. 
- Bye.

119
00:06:48,252 --> 00:06:49,276
Nice fella.

120
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:51,222
Excuse me, but who was that man?

121
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:51,928
What man?

122
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:53,767
That man, that man in the elevator.

123
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:56,142
Oh. That man.

124
00:06:56,228 --> 00:06:59,194
Allison, that man was a true human oddity,

125
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:01,389
the kind of man you don't meet every day in this city.

126
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:06,443
A throwback to another time, when Phoenicians actually cared for the well-being of others.

127
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:09,925
Allison, that man was an honest-to-God Good Samaritan.

128
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,552
And does this good Samaritan have a name?

129
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:13,243
Yeah. Jared Swanstrom.

130
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:16,022
And what makes Mr. Swanstrom such a Good Samaritan?

131
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:20,225
Last night, that young man happened to look out his apartment window

132
00:07:20,283 --> 00:07:23,002
and notice that the apartment across the way was being burglarized.

133
00:07:23,073 --> 00:07:26,074
He phoned the police, gave them a complete description of the burglar,

134
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,225
and this morning he positively identified the man in a lineup.

135
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:32,821
This afternoon he's coming back to give us his official statement, and...

136
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:35,915
in the event of a trial, he's already agreed to testify.

137
00:07:35,985 --> 00:07:37,727
- So he's a witness?
- Yes.

138
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:39,277
Why, did you think he was a criminal?

139
00:07:41,122 --> 00:07:42,529
Why would I think that?

140
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,128
A hundred and eight.

141
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:49,923
Eighty-one.

142
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:52,177
Look at it this way-- you were half right.

143
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,242
You dreamt about the guy, and there he was the next day.

144
00:07:55,346 --> 00:07:56,870
I'm just saying it's weird, that's all.

145
00:07:56,952 --> 00:08:00,854
I mean, last night I dream about this violent, scary guy, and today there he is?

146
00:08:01,202 --> 00:08:03,981
And he's all, "Howdy, ma'am, can I hold that elevator for you?"

147
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:09,216
Am I a terrible husband if I interject here that your dreams are often subject to interpretation?

148
00:08:09,276 --> 00:08:11,959
- And that given the possible state of your hormones... 
- 66.

149
00:08:12,052 --> 00:08:13,342
Let's leave my hormones out of this.

150
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:15,948
My hormones are innocent until proven impregnated.

151
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:18,108
- So moved.
- Seventy-seven.

152
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,203
Is that Ariel? Where are you?

153
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:21,729
Home sweet home.

154
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:24,653
I finished that DOD project ahead of schedule,

155
00:08:24,698 --> 00:08:27,489
so I figured I'd take the afternoon off and get a jump on tutoring.

156
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,847
Oh, boy, you're really campaigning for father of the year, huh?

157
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,302
Just trying to be helpful.

158
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:34,391
Speaking of which,

159
00:08:34,591 --> 00:08:37,889
don't forget to bring everything home that we need to prepare for your test.

160
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,960
Oh, yes, my little pop quiz-- I haven't forgotten.

161
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,245
Very funny.

162
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:45,886
And you'll be happy to know that Ariel does not have a problem with math.

163
00:08:45,982 --> 00:08:49,202
She's doing grade-level stuff here, she doesn't even have to work anything out.

164
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:51,108
Clearly, she takes after her dad.

165
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,279
- Oh, she snores?
- 51.

166
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:54,538
Not so funny.

167
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:58,164
- So, when you gonna take it?
- Take what?

168
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,566
The test.

169
00:08:59,735 --> 00:09:02,997
Oh, I think you're supposed to take it in the morning. It's more accurate or something.

170
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,476
So we have to wait all night?

171
00:09:04,616 --> 00:09:07,108
What's your rush? Thinking about painting the nursery blue?

172
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:09,489
I'm actually at the drugstore right now.

173
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:12,227
Tell Ariel to keep up the good work, and I'll see you later.

174
00:09:12,648 --> 00:09:15,458
Oh, they're having a sale on boys' disposable diapers.

175
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:16,883
You want me to pick up a pack?

176
00:09:17,128 --> 00:09:19,755
Nah. I outgrew those a while ago.

177
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:21,951
- Love you.
- You better.

178
00:09:34,613 --> 00:09:36,743
I look across at the other apartment, and...

179
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:37,911
Yes?

180
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,283
Allison, what's up?

181
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:45,405
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were in the middle of an interview.

182
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:46,962
What can I help you with?

183
00:09:48,248 --> 00:09:50,781
Well, I was... done for the day,

184
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,049
so I wanted to know if you needed anything, 'cause I thought I would...

185
00:09:57,648 --> 00:09:59,957
I'm sorry. You look so familiar.

186
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,255
Jared Swanstrom, this is a colleague of mine, Allison Dubois.

187
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:09,659
Allison, this is the gentleman who witnessed that robbery

188
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:11,523
that I told you about that's been so helpful.

189
00:10:11,615 --> 00:10:14,989
Oh, right, that's it, the elevator this morning. Of course.

190
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,027
Thank you so much for everything you're doing.

191
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:20,995
Everyone keeps saying that. I guess I didn't realize I had another choice.

192
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,821
Oh, you'd be amazed how apathetic most people are.

193
00:10:24,636 --> 00:10:26,622
It's a pleasure to meet somebody like you.

194
00:10:26,786 --> 00:10:27,912
It's a pleasure to meet you.

195
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,511
- Allison?
- Excuse me.

196
00:10:33,756 --> 00:10:34,634
Excuse me.

197
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:41,367
Hey... you all right?

198
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:42,392
Thank you.

199
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,301
Do you want someone to drive you home?

200
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:45,463
No, I'm okay.

201
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:51,869
Have you seen your doctor?

202
00:10:52,136 --> 00:10:53,513
No, not yet.

203
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:56,263
Is that what you think? No, no, no.

204
00:10:56,334 --> 00:10:58,326
It has nothing to do with me-- it's him.

205
00:10:58,704 --> 00:11:00,481
He shook my hand, and he...

206
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:04,675
he was saying something to me, but I couldn't hear what he was saying.

207
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:06,508
Wait a second. What?

208
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:09,445
You're saying that Swanstrom made you feel ill?

209
00:11:09,514 --> 00:11:12,901
It was like a... a dull roar in my head,

210
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,870
and I could hear my... blood pulsing through me, and I saw things...

211
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,422
All right, come on, let's sit down.

212
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,658
Women. Murder, torture.

213
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:26,445
There were so many of them, and he...

214
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:29,159
I've never seen somebody so in their element.

215
00:11:29,574 --> 00:11:30,638
He's a killer.

216
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:34,710
- Who's a killer, Allison?
- He is. That man.

217
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,063
Your... Good Samaritan.

218
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:41,422
He's killed women; he kills them, lots of them.

219
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:45,445
Allison, maybe you should clarify your own condition before you speculate...

220
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:47,637
- It has nothing to do with my own condition.
- I'm just saying...

221
00:11:47,735 --> 00:11:51,125
I've been pregnant before. I know what it is to be pregnant.

222
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:55,189
- I've been pregnant three times-- this is not pregnant.
- All right.

223
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,565
Whatever it is, we... we need to get you home.

224
00:11:57,938 --> 00:11:59,342
All right? Come on.

225
00:12:04,293 --> 00:12:06,006
You will check on him, right?

226
00:12:06,745 --> 00:12:11,055
If you go home and promise to relax, take a few days off, then... yeah.

227
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:17,353
And you'll call me as soon as you get something?

228
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:19,960
Allison, get some rest.

229
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:42,970
You don't look good.

230
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:47,065
Beautiful, but not terribly good.

231
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:48,607
What's the matter?

232
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,520
I had a little... episode.

233
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:53,066
You have a tough day?

234
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:56,962
Sort of. I puked in front of my boss.

235
00:12:57,132 --> 00:12:59,108
Was that before or after you asked for the raise?

236
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:02,545
Come on, let's get you to bed.

237
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:17,407
I feel so guilty.

238
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,641
About what?

239
00:13:19,193 --> 00:13:20,996
You look so miserable, and I'm...

240
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:23,366
I'm excited.

241
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:25,389
It's not what you think.

242
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:29,235
Oh, baby, I think it's time we had a chat about the birds and the bees.

243
00:13:29,331 --> 00:13:30,842
You're late, you're nauseous.

244
00:13:30,974 --> 00:13:33,068
Face it. I think we're talking table for six.

245
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,522
Relax Maitre d'.

246
00:13:35,444 --> 00:13:38,004
It has nothing to do with the birds and the bees.

247
00:13:38,922 --> 00:13:40,503
I saw that man again.

248
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:42,614
The one from my dream.

249
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:44,696
The one I told you about.

250
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:47,712
The solid citizen who saw the burglary?

251
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:50,349
I touched him, I shook his hand.

252
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,688
That's what made me ill.

253
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:57,968
Allison, people get ill because something disturbs the body's chemical equilibrium,

254
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:02,028
not because they shook hands with somebody who's...

255
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:08,392
Evil? Joe, this man is evil in the most unimaginable ways.

256
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:11,026
Because he looks so benign.

257
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:13,292
Because he looks so friendly, so nice.

258
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:18,919
And not only that.

259
00:14:19,932 --> 00:14:22,790
He has a kind of radar for innocence.

260
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,303
He can spot it a mile away.

261
00:14:27,137 --> 00:14:28,720
And once he's found it,

262
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:33,010
he becomes obsessed with possessing it.

263
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:36,659
He seems so harmless...

264
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,458
so when he offers them a ride, they almost always accept.

265
00:14:44,006 --> 00:14:49,082
Then he drugs them, and by the time they come to, they're tied up somewhere, helpless.

266
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:54,401
Then he rapes them, bathes them.

267
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:57,622
Rapes them again, drugs them some more.

268
00:14:58,338 --> 00:15:02,624
And when he can no longer convince himself of their innocence, he kills them...

269
00:15:05,024 --> 00:15:08,291
takes their bodies, puts them in their car, drives them to the desert

270
00:15:08,352 --> 00:15:12,608
and dumps them there for the animals to feast on.

271
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,848
There have been lots of them.

272
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,574
Maybe six.

273
00:15:18,024 --> 00:15:21,235
But there's this one woman in particular I keep seeing.

274
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:25,075
She has red hair, blue eyes.

275
00:15:25,776 --> 00:15:27,174
A beautiful girl.

276
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,093
She told him her name was Sharona.

277
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:32,120
She was his first.

278
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:34,635
He didn't really want to part with her.

279
00:15:35,288 --> 00:15:37,206
He loved her in his own way,

280
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,574
but the smell was beginning to become noticeable.

281
00:15:41,756 --> 00:15:46,078
And even as he walked her body towards its sandy, dusty resting place,

282
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,847
he swore he'd never do this again.

283
00:15:49,553 --> 00:15:52,733
Never fall in love with someone only to have to part with them.

284
00:15:53,794 --> 00:15:56,235
But even as he made the promise,

285
00:15:56,743 --> 00:15:58,570
he knew he couldn't keep it.

286
00:16:01,102 --> 00:16:02,416
Honey?

287
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:05,462
Honey?

288
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:13,716
How was your day?

289
00:16:17,746 --> 00:16:20,617
Would you do me a favor and go get me one of those tests?

290
00:16:21,637 --> 00:16:22,896
What are you talking about?

291
00:16:23,587 --> 00:16:26,320
Well, if I'm not pregnant, I really want a drink.

292
00:16:27,397 --> 00:16:29,649
I thought you said mornings were more accurate.

293
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:31,584
I did say that, didn't I?

294
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:33,622
That was stupid of me.

295
00:16:36,552 --> 00:16:38,077
Get some rest, Al.

296
00:16:47,955 --> 00:16:49,004
Morning.

297
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:50,871
Allison?

298
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,743
It's barely 8:20.

299
00:16:53,984 --> 00:16:56,022
Nobody's even here for another 40 minutes.

300
00:16:56,104 --> 00:16:58,346
Well, I had to run the kids to school, so I just thought...

301
00:16:58,408 --> 00:17:01,009
I don't remember asking you to come in this morning.

302
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:04,301
I mean, how are you? You feeling better?

303
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:05,249
A little.

304
00:17:05,552 --> 00:17:08,889
You didn't. I actually came in sort of on my own.

305
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,881
I was wondering about Jared Swanstrom.

306
00:17:10,993 --> 00:17:13,143
Jared Swanstrom? Yeah, what about him?

307
00:17:13,225 --> 00:17:16,278
Well, you promised me you'd look into his background. Check him out.

308
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:20,358
I guess you haven't had a chance yet.

309
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,972
Allison, it's not the habit of the District Attorney's office

310
00:17:24,054 --> 00:17:28,433
to run criminal background checks on citizens who come forward to report crimes.

311
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,350
- Well, you told me you'd check it out.
- And you told me that you'd get some rest.

312
00:17:31,437 --> 00:17:33,676
- I feel fine.
- Well, you don't look fine.

313
00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:38,114
And you're not acting fine. You're acting a bit paranoid. A bit obsessive.

314
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:39,926
Allison, please go home.

315
00:17:40,096 --> 00:17:43,701
I'll call you when and if there's a reason to.

316
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:47,141
But you will check, right? You are going to run his name.

317
00:17:47,213 --> 00:17:48,278
You did promise.

318
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:55,175
And there's a girl. A victim, I think.

319
00:17:55,262 --> 00:17:56,839
She has red hair. Her name's Sharona.

320
00:17:56,933 --> 00:17:59,890
She's a student, a local. Arizona State, maybe.

321
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:04,125
Could you just check and see if maybe there's a missing persons report?

322
00:18:04,227 --> 00:18:05,906
Something open? Please?

323
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:06,889
All right, Allison.

324
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:10,007
Thank you.

325
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:13,003
I'll wait for your call.

326
00:18:17,175 --> 00:18:19,300
I have much good news to report.

327
00:18:19,408 --> 00:18:21,102
I shall be the judge of that.

328
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:24,569
All persons under five feet of height are officially in bed.

329
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:25,674
I'm proud of you.

330
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:27,600
And reporting from the math front,

331
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:31,374
I think if you take a look at these equations I did with Ariel this evening,

332
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,050
it'll become pretty damn obvious that her only problem with fourth grade math

333
00:18:35,268 --> 00:18:37,804
- is that it isn't tenth grade math.
- Excuse me?

334
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,058
She's bored, Al.

335
00:18:39,447 --> 00:18:40,861
She's advanced.

336
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:44,091
Look at these. I put together some geometry problems.

337
00:18:44,337 --> 00:18:47,035
Geometry? Joe, you're giving her geometry?

338
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:48,407
She's nine years old.

339
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:51,070
And nine rhymes with Einstein.

340
00:18:51,485 --> 00:18:52,704
Sort of.

341
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:55,674
I'm telling you, she did a spectacular job.

342
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:58,008
She's performing way above grade level.

343
00:18:58,192 --> 00:19:00,087
Frankly, she reminds me of me.

344
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,224
A nine-year-old girl reminds you of you? Hmm.

345
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:08,115
You're taking a perfectly sweet figure of speech and you're turning it into something...

346
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:10,732
I don't even want to contemplate what you must be thinking.

347
00:19:10,814 --> 00:19:12,277
Why are you staring at the phone?

348
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,802
It's almost 9:30.

349
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:15,385
Are you expecting a call?

350
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:17,151
The DA's office.

351
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:20,121
- But it's not going to happen.
- How do you know?

352
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:23,132
I went in to see him today. I told him about my dreams.

353
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:24,510
Really?

354
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:27,618
After you took the test?

355
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,326
Allison...

356
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:35,369
Peeing in the morning is kind of automatic, honey. I just didn't think about it.

357
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:38,938
Right.

358
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:42,778
So you forgot to use the test this morning.

359
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,730
Well, I suppose there's more pee where that came from.

360
00:19:46,828 --> 00:19:48,026
You can bet on it.

361
00:19:50,587 --> 00:19:52,839
I guess I'll still sleep with you tonight.

362
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:55,516
Thank you, kind sir.

363
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:02,889
Nothing?

364
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:05,587
Less than nothing. Naught.

365
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:12,362
He was never suspected of murder, but he does volunteer at a homeless shelter once a month.

366
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,448
No arrests for assault, but he does attend church regularly.

367
00:20:15,536 --> 00:20:17,957
No speeding tickets or parking tickets,

368
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,322
and he is a mentor to a fatherless boy in Tempe.

369
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,115
I was thinking of asking the mayor to give him the key to the city, but I was afraid

370
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:29,038
his Honor would be threatened in the presence of someone with so much moral fiber.

371
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:32,750
And you might find it comforting to know there have been no red-headed women

372
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:36,815
named Sharona reported missing or murdered in this state since 1983.

373
00:20:38,463 --> 00:20:39,611
Okay.

374
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:42,462
Allison, this is good news.

375
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:45,510
Sometimes it's good to be wrong.

376
00:20:46,184 --> 00:20:48,007
- Mommy?
- Yeah?

377
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:50,926
Look. Daddy said I got them all right.

378
00:20:51,135 --> 00:20:55,022
Wow. Wow, this looks complicated, sweetie.

379
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:58,314
I know, but it wasn't. Daddy was really happy.

380
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:01,242
He's very proud of you. He told me so.

381
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:03,787
Mommy?

382
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:09,701
Do you think Daddy sometimes wishes I was a boy?

383
00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:12,184
No.

384
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:17,509
Daddy loves you very much just the way you are.

385
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,592
Okay. Just checking.

386
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,548
Mommy?

387
00:21:23,843 --> 00:21:26,419
You won't let the bad man hurt us, will you?

388
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:30,084
- What bad man?
- I think she's talking about me.

389
00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:42,142
Damn.

390
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:45,353
I was thinking. I got distracted.

391
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,238
Yeah. That thinking will do that every time.

392
00:21:49,971 --> 00:21:51,701
The bad Samaritan, I presume?

393
00:21:51,824 --> 00:21:53,728
Stop giving him cute names.

394
00:21:55,428 --> 00:21:57,528
I was thinking about his guts, actually.

395
00:21:57,615 --> 00:21:59,791
Small intestine? Large intestine?

396
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:01,480
Not those kind of guts?

397
00:22:01,982 --> 00:22:03,216
Think about it.

398
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:07,917
You've kidnapped, tortured and killed a handful of women

399
00:22:08,131 --> 00:22:10,030
and raised absolutely no suspicion.

400
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:14,911
I mean, if you're any kind of self-respecting sociopath who takes any kind of pride in their work,

401
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:18,878
that must to be absolutely intoxicating, right?

402
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:21,444
I was thinking the kids aren't going to be up for another 15 minutes

403
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,245
and I was going to ask you if you want to have sex, but,

404
00:22:23,318 --> 00:22:26,589
I don't know, you started talking and the urge just suddenly left me.

405
00:22:26,685 --> 00:22:30,449
How do you up that rush? How do you sustain that thrill?

406
00:22:30,634 --> 00:22:34,309
By walking into the district attorney's office and offering to help him solve a crime.

407
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,553
That's pretty gutty.

408
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,525
- Or?
- Or?

409
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,886
Or there's no guts involved because he didn't do it.

410
00:22:40,182 --> 00:22:41,605
Because it never happened.

411
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:43,884
Because he's just a good Samaritan.

412
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:45,392
Because there are no dead co-eds.

413
00:22:45,456 --> 00:22:48,108
Because this whole scenario exists only...

414
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:51,569
Because I might be pregnant?

415
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,565
Or because you don't want to deal with the possibility. I don't know.

416
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:58,548
All I know is, it takes a lot less energy to piss on a piece of plastic

417
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:02,666
than it does to ponder the twisted courage of a man you've met for all of two minutes.

418
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:11,984
Swanson...

419
00:23:13,796 --> 00:23:15,137
Swanstrom.

420
00:23:15,803 --> 00:23:17,687
Jared Swanstrom.

421
00:23:18,301 --> 00:23:21,660
Arrogant bastard's even listed in the phone book.

422
00:23:49,006 --> 00:23:52,663
This is dumb. This is, like, the dumbest thing I've ever done in my life.

423
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:31,866
Yes, hi. This is Allison Dubois.

424
00:24:31,932 --> 00:24:33,828
I work with the district attorney's office.

425
00:24:35,312 --> 00:24:36,705
Yes, this is an emergency.

426
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,378
I have reason to believe I'm following a car

427
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:42,430
that's being used to transport the dead body of a murder victim.

428
00:24:43,176 --> 00:24:45,947
Dubois. D-U-B-O-I-S.

429
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,981
No. No one's being murdered right now,

430
00:24:50,294 --> 00:24:52,516
but I believe the murderer is in the process of getting away

431
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:55,297
or at the very least attempting to destroy the evidence.

432
00:24:55,657 --> 00:24:58,071
His license plate is 1-2-6...

433
00:24:58,271 --> 00:24:59,792
F-I-O.

434
00:25:01,528 --> 00:25:06,121
I don't know. I'm... at the corner of Chaparral and Miller, traveling north.

435
00:25:09,277 --> 00:25:11,911
No. I already told you-- no one is being murdered right now.

436
00:25:13,857 --> 00:25:16,161
What do you mean, "Is he breaking any other laws?"

437
00:25:16,258 --> 00:25:19,827
I told you. I believe there is a dead body in his trunk.

438
00:25:24,118 --> 00:25:27,702
Look, I can't drive and talk at the same time. He's getting away.

439
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,544
He's getting on the freeway.

440
00:25:32,622 --> 00:25:35,472
What do you mean, that's outside your jurisdiction? Oh, hell.

441
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:45,344
Yes. I'm talking about a crime happening right now, or an accident anyway.

442
00:25:45,432 --> 00:25:49,810
We are at the Chaparral on-ramp. Not on the freeway, still in your jurisdiction.

443
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:53,188
Yes, ma'am. No, I did it. I hit him with my car. Now, hurry. Please.

444
00:25:53,268 --> 00:25:55,708
- Are you okay?!
- He's approaching my vehicle!

445
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:59,062
Did I, did I stop short or something?

446
00:26:00,281 --> 00:26:03,296
Hey, I know you. You're the woman from the D.A.'s. Are you okay?

447
00:26:05,703 --> 00:26:08,166
Okay, they're here. They're here. Thank you.

448
00:26:10,265 --> 00:26:14,207
Sir, move away from the window. Move away from the window, okay?

449
00:26:14,386 --> 00:26:15,205
Just back off.

450
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:20,090
You all right, ma'am?

451
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,266
We're fine. You're fine, right? She's fine.

452
00:26:22,338 --> 00:26:25,410
- Great, I need to see your license and registration, please.
- Okay, but I think we can work this out ourselves.

453
00:26:28,123 --> 00:26:31,133
Sir, turn around and put your hands on the hood. I need you to spread your feet, okay?

454
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:31,937
Excuse me?

455
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,597
I'm going to have an officer pat you down.

456
00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:37,365
- You call 911, ma'am?
- Yes, Officer.

457
00:26:37,795 --> 00:26:41,067
Is this the man... driving the vehicle you claim has a body in the trunk?

458
00:26:41,138 --> 00:26:42,338
What? What did you tell them?

459
00:26:42,552 --> 00:26:44,149
Sir, we're gonna have to look in the trunk.

460
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:46,786
All right, this is crazy. I mean, this is a joke, right?

461
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:50,472
- You have no right to look in my car.
- Let me tell you how this works, okay?

462
00:26:50,897 --> 00:26:53,611
You're gonna open the trunk willingly, or I'm gonna take you downtown

463
00:26:53,683 --> 00:26:55,362
and we're all gonna sit around while I get a warrant.

464
00:26:55,423 --> 00:26:57,297
It's not a question of if, it's a question of when.

465
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,702
- Wait. Why'd you do this? Why did you call them?
- Hey, hey! Sir.

466
00:26:59,788 --> 00:27:02,187
Why don't you direct all your comments and questions at me, okay?

467
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,190
I don't understand.

468
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:05,361
I witnessed a robbery and now this, this...

469
00:27:05,448 --> 00:27:06,805
Hey. Watch yourself, okay?

470
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:11,183
Just, this woman from the D.A.'s office is stalking me.

471
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:14,880
Ma'am? Your story hasn't changed, has it?

472
00:27:14,962 --> 00:27:16,343
I know what I saw.

473
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:17,741
He killed a woman.

474
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:20,645
Then he rolled her up in a rug and put her in his trunk.

475
00:27:21,157 --> 00:27:22,734
Officer, that's completely absurd.

476
00:27:23,195 --> 00:27:24,925
All right, look. This is your last chance.

477
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:28,115
- Fine. Fine.
- Good. let's have a look.

478
00:27:29,662 --> 00:27:30,731
Hold onto this.

479
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:37,920
That's the rug, but...

480
00:27:39,272 --> 00:27:41,827
Yeah. But what?

481
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:44,254
The one that I saw was older. It was stained.

482
00:27:44,555 --> 00:27:47,346
I don't know what you "saw," but this rug is brand new.

483
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:51,088
My friend works at a carpet warehouse and they just went out of business. He left this for me.

484
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,755
- I picked it up this morning.
- I don't know what to tell you.

485
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:56,445
- Well, I'd start with "I'm sorry."
- Thank you.

486
00:27:56,516 --> 00:27:58,052
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

487
00:27:58,508 --> 00:28:00,484
I'm gonna issue you two summonses, Ms. Dubois.

488
00:28:00,566 --> 00:28:03,413
One for reckless driving, and the other for filing a false report.

489
00:28:03,485 --> 00:28:05,927
- But, Officer, wait.
- Don't compound the situation, okay?

490
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:08,190
I'll also gonna file a report with the D.A's office and let them know

491
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:11,595
that you summoned for police assistance here when there wasn't a need for it, okay?

492
00:28:11,877 --> 00:28:15,399
Sir, you want to file harassment charges against Ms. Dubois?

493
00:28:19,203 --> 00:28:21,158
No. No. Not at this time.

494
00:28:21,257 --> 00:28:23,500
Good. Now, I want you both to get back in your vehicles,

495
00:28:23,595 --> 00:28:25,751
call your insurance companies, and be on your way.

496
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,590
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir.

497
00:28:27,676 --> 00:28:29,249
Perfectly.

498
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,308
Damn.

499
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:39,589
Does Daddy know that you crushed the car?

500
00:28:39,682 --> 00:28:41,091
Yes, I called him.

501
00:28:41,732 --> 00:28:44,153
Daddy is going to kill you when he gets home.

502
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,400
Ariel... Mommies and daddies don't kill each other.

503
00:28:46,472 --> 00:28:48,531
Sometimes they get disappointed. Sometimes they get annoyed,

504
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:50,988
but by and large, mommies and daddies don't kill each other.

505
00:28:53,124 --> 00:28:54,505
Okay, sweetie.

506
00:28:55,326 --> 00:28:56,702
Let's have a tea party.

507
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,055
Now, let's do homework.

508
00:29:03,153 --> 00:29:04,787
What? You don't have any homework?

509
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:08,996
No. I do, but I sorta want to wait for Daddy to get home.

510
00:29:09,062 --> 00:29:11,908
Well, Daddy's got his class tonight. He won't be home till late. Can I help?

511
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,881
No, I don't think so. It's math, and he really makes math easy.

512
00:29:15,949 --> 00:29:17,136
Well, I know math.

513
00:29:17,729 --> 00:29:18,723
Sort of.

514
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,642
I'll tell you what.

515
00:29:21,856 --> 00:29:25,297
You get your book and I'll get my abacus, and we'll give it a shot.

516
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:36,680
No... I need Daddy.

517
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,667
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

518
00:29:38,738 --> 00:29:39,515
Why?

519
00:29:42,701 --> 00:29:45,445
Because he gives me the answers.

520
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:49,536
Wait a second. Daddy does not give you the answers.

521
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:54,580
Well... he kind of shows them to me.

522
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,684
What do you mean, he shows them to you, darling?

523
00:30:00,979 --> 00:30:01,963
I don't know.

524
00:30:02,453 --> 00:30:04,347
He looks at the problem with me,

525
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:09,150
and I just see the numbers in my head and I just write them down.

526
00:30:13,717 --> 00:30:16,703
And you don't see any numbers when you're with me, right?

527
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:23,399
Yeah... I do, but they have letters in them, too, so I know they can't be right.

528
00:30:26,294 --> 00:30:27,311
Okay...

529
00:30:29,271 --> 00:30:30,429
Tell you what.

530
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:32,728
Write them down. Show them to me.

531
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,819
Watch Marie for second.

532
00:30:51,273 --> 00:30:52,481
What about my homework?

533
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:54,658
I'll just need a second.

534
00:30:55,743 --> 00:30:57,218
Try to work it out for yourself.

535
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,337
Work it out?

536
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,789
District Attorney, Devalos' office.

537
00:31:21,855 --> 00:31:23,591
Hi. This is Allison Dubois.

538
00:31:23,811 --> 00:31:26,929
I have this license plate number I need to check for this case I'm working on.

539
00:31:26,995 --> 00:31:28,926
I think it might be a rental car.

540
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:31,665
Well, to be honest, the police usually handle that kind of thing.

541
00:31:31,737 --> 00:31:33,268
You know, I used to work over there.

542
00:31:33,499 --> 00:31:36,888
Why don't you give it to me and I'll call it over and see what I can find out.

543
00:31:36,975 --> 00:31:38,131
Terrific. Thank you.

544
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:42,433
Okay, the number is "4-2-7-Q-U-I."

545
00:31:42,857 --> 00:31:45,454
Did you say "Q-U-I"?

546
00:31:45,546 --> 00:31:46,500
Are you sure about that?

547
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:47,757
What do you mean?

548
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:53,691
Well, if I remember correctly, the first letter on an Arizona plate advances with each new run.

549
00:31:53,754 --> 00:31:55,954
Right now, we're issuing plates with "F."

550
00:31:56,155 --> 00:31:59,430
I believe the plate you just read me doesn't exist yet.

551
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:02,190
What do you mean? When will it exist?

552
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,430
I'm guessing we'll get to Q anywhere from seven to ten years from now.

553
00:32:08,755 --> 00:32:10,743
Mommy...

554
00:32:13,425 --> 00:32:16,026
Mommy...

555
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:18,380
Joe?

556
00:32:18,534 --> 00:32:20,106
Mommy...

557
00:32:24,012 --> 00:32:26,557
Mommy...

558
00:32:30,705 --> 00:32:33,274
Mommy...

559
00:32:36,793 --> 00:32:39,747
I think you owe me an apology, Allison.

560
00:33:20,692 --> 00:33:22,003
Trouble sleeping?

561
00:33:23,097 --> 00:33:23,872
No.

562
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,082
Sleeping's easy.

563
00:33:27,281 --> 00:33:29,344
Sleeping's a dream.

564
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:33,415
It's the waking stuff that can really screw with your head.

565
00:33:40,007 --> 00:33:41,734
I don't know what to tell you, Joe.

566
00:33:44,158 --> 00:33:46,614
I guess I didn't take the test because I was...

567
00:33:47,464 --> 00:33:48,436
afraid.

568
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:52,518
Afraid I would be pregnant.

569
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,093
Afraid I wouldn't be.

570
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,909
Depending on the time of day, I guess I just didn't really like either choice.

571
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,175
I'm sorry.

572
00:34:07,115 --> 00:34:08,174
Me, too.

573
00:34:18,011 --> 00:34:18,918
But you know what?

574
00:34:20,248 --> 00:34:22,797
We already have three great kids.

575
00:34:26,992 --> 00:34:29,387
Yeah, I need to talk to you about that, too.

576
00:34:29,597 --> 00:34:30,427
Okay.

577
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:35,177
Our wonderful daughter Ariel,

578
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:41,788
who is so beautiful and smart and exceptional in so many ways...

579
00:34:42,631 --> 00:34:47,108
just isn't exceptional in the way you hoped.

580
00:34:54,132 --> 00:34:56,461
She doesn't take after me at all, does she?

581
00:34:58,643 --> 00:35:00,072
She takes after you.

582
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:09,522
By the time we got to advanced algebra, I suspected.

583
00:35:11,018 --> 00:35:13,471
But I guess I didn't really want to know for sure.

584
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:17,163
I guess there's a lot of that going around.

585
00:35:19,415 --> 00:35:21,771
So, ask me about my case.

586
00:35:21,863 --> 00:35:23,061
How goes the case?

587
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:26,159
It's going, it's going, it's gone.

588
00:35:26,308 --> 00:35:27,198
Really.

589
00:35:32,134 --> 00:35:34,714
Because it never really happened.

590
00:35:36,163 --> 00:35:38,626
Because he really is a good Samaritan.

591
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,450
Because there are no dead co-eds.

592
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,759
Because the whole thing only existed...

593
00:36:08,803 --> 00:36:10,533
Hi. Is he in?

594
00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:12,217
Court. Was he expecting you?

595
00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:17,061
No. I thought I'd surprise him. I have to do a little fence mending, some apologizing.

596
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,899
I saw the fax from the Chief of Police.

597
00:36:18,997 --> 00:36:21,055
Which reminds me, there's something here for you.

598
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:24,936
Didn't you ask us to check on a possible missing "Sharona"?

599
00:36:25,971 --> 00:36:28,941
- College student with red hair?
- Yeah.

600
00:36:29,073 --> 00:36:33,138
No. Not only are there none missing, there's been only been one Sharona born

601
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,071
within a 50-mile radius of Phoenix since 1980, and she's only 14.

602
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,290
Wait a second.

603
00:36:49,938 --> 00:36:50,982
Sharona?

604
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:53,189
I'm sorry, do I know you?

605
00:36:54,157 --> 00:36:57,059
No. But I need to talk to you for a second.

606
00:36:57,755 --> 00:37:00,101
It's okay, really. We can do it right here.

607
00:37:01,226 --> 00:37:04,385
My name is Allison Dubois and I need to tell you something.

608
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,626
And you're going to think it sounds sort of crazy.

609
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,744
You're going to think I'm some weird old lady

610
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:12,235
who you met at school who told you this strange story,

611
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:13,695
and that's fine.

612
00:37:14,053 --> 00:37:16,228
As long as you just listen.

613
00:37:17,576 --> 00:37:18,875
Okay.

614
00:37:19,593 --> 00:37:21,324
Seven years from now,

615
00:37:21,851 --> 00:37:24,539
a man is going to come up to you on the street.

616
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:28,184
You'll be in college, you'll be very pretty.

617
00:37:28,527 --> 00:37:32,813
You'll be carrying your books and one of your shoelaces will be untied.

618
00:37:33,176 --> 00:37:37,517
This man, he'll offer to hold your books while you tie your shoelace.

619
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:39,606
He'll seem nice and polite

620
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:43,047
and you'll think, "maybe a little old for me but harmless."

621
00:37:43,288 --> 00:37:45,362
But he isn't harmless.

622
00:37:45,592 --> 00:37:48,982
He will rape you and murder you if you let him.

623
00:37:49,765 --> 00:37:53,037
So when he offers you a ride, say no.

624
00:37:53,231 --> 00:37:56,098
And then just walk away.

625
00:37:56,185 --> 00:37:57,752
And if he won't let you,

626
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,285
then you fight, scream,

627
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:03,041
bite him, kick him.

628
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,107
Just promise me you won't get in that car, okay?

629
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,391
Promise me.

630
00:38:08,998 --> 00:38:11,644
Wait a sec, you came here to tell me

631
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:15,252
about something you think might happen seven years from now?

632
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,894
Just promise me you will fight like hell. Promise me.

633
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,992
Look, lady, you're right, this is crazy.

634
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,448
Sharona! You don't have to believe anything I say.

635
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,444
You just have to remember it.

636
00:38:27,976 --> 00:38:29,937
You will, won't you?

637
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,231
I can tell.

638
00:38:32,635 --> 00:38:34,115
And you will fight.

639
00:38:35,984 --> 00:38:38,242
And you're going to have a great life.

640
00:38:57,844 --> 00:38:58,894
Slam dunk.

641
00:38:59,098 --> 00:39:01,779
Judge took about a minute and half to decide to throw the book

642
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,396
at Phoenix's favorite cat burglar thanks to the testimony of our good friend here.

643
00:39:07,032 --> 00:39:08,261
How's your car?

644
00:39:09,803 --> 00:39:11,415
You and I need to talk.

645
00:39:11,661 --> 00:39:12,694
Tomorrow.

646
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,518
Jared.

647
00:39:20,114 --> 00:39:21,604
I gotta tell you, lady,

648
00:39:22,545 --> 00:39:23,891
you floor me.

649
00:39:24,501 --> 00:39:28,326
After all I've done, all I'm doing, why would... why would you do what you did?

650
00:39:28,382 --> 00:39:30,047
Why did you say those things to the police?

651
00:39:30,127 --> 00:39:31,035
I'm sorry.

652
00:39:31,127 --> 00:39:33,840
- Well, you ought to be.
- But it's true.

653
00:39:34,337 --> 00:39:35,171
Excuse me?

654
00:39:35,258 --> 00:39:37,788
Or it will be... in the next seven to ten years.

655
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:41,915
What? This is crazy. I have never hurt anybody.

656
00:39:41,997 --> 00:39:45,622
- I could never hurt anyone.
- Then don't.

657
00:39:46,195 --> 00:39:50,625
Look, I don't know who it is that breaks your heart or crushes your spirit

658
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,141
or pushes you over that line that people like you cross so easily...

659
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:58,391
- No one's going to break my heart.
- Admit it, you think about it all the time.

660
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:02,580
You think about how you'll do it-- what it'll feel like,

661
00:40:02,815 --> 00:40:05,677
what they'll smell like, what they'll taste like.

662
00:40:05,881 --> 00:40:08,017
You know who you really are.

663
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:10,153
You're the golem.

664
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,702
You're the devil.

665
00:40:13,463 --> 00:40:14,980
You're a monster.

666
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:18,268
Now do me a favor.

667
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,432
Do the world a favor.

668
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:23,152
Make a liar out of me.

669
00:40:29,197 --> 00:40:30,856
Tell Mr. Devalos I had to go.

670
00:40:30,957 --> 00:40:32,194
I'll do that.

671
00:40:40,744 --> 00:40:41,800
You're wrong.

672
00:40:48,787 --> 00:40:50,138
Let's hope so.
