1
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,901
Hey!

2
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:48,901
I need help here.

3
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:52,167
Thanks for nothing!

4
00:00:58,234 --> 00:01:00,501
Hey.

5
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:01,501
Hey.

6
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:02,868
Hey, buddy!

7
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:05,367
Yeah, you.

8
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:12,067
I'm a little surprised
you can see me.

9
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,567
I got two eyes, don't I?

10
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:15,000
Y-You got
a cell phone on you?

11
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,801
Why?
'Cause I-I think I need
to, to call the cops.

12
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:19,567
The cops? What are
you talking about?

13
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:22,601
My wife just tried to kill me.

14
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:24,501
Really?

15
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:27,734
I was sitting in the den,
watching the end of the game.

16
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:29,901
She was in the kitchen
doing dishes.

17
00:01:29,934 --> 00:01:32,467
Out of nowhere, she calls out
and wants to know

18
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:35,267
i-if I got my beer
on a coaster.

19
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,868
So I says, "No.

20
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:39,334
No, I don't have my beer
on a coaster."

21
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:41,901
So she yells back,
"How many times, Vincent?

22
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:44,834
How many times have I told you
about the coaster?"

23
00:01:44,868 --> 00:01:46,601
So I says, "I don't know.

24
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:48,033
"How many times
have I asked you

25
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,767
to stop being ugly?"

26
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,601
And then,
I didn't hear anything,

27
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:55,501
but, like, a second later,

28
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:57,567
she comes flying
out of the kitchen.

29
00:01:57,601 --> 00:01:59,367
She-She's got a carving knife
in her hand,

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,100
and she's got this look
in her eyes.

31
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:04,100
Next thing I know,
she's on top of me

32
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:05,968
and I, I got my hands
around her wrist,

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,133
and her ugly face is
right up against mine.

34
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:14,467
Somehow, I push her off
a-and, and I start running,

35
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,834
out the door, down the block.

36
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:19,934
I-I-I ran all the way
to the boulevard here.

37
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:22,901
I mean, this is the first
I've stopped.

38
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,400
Look at me, look at me.

39
00:02:25,434 --> 00:02:26,981
I'm shaking.

40
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:31,801
What?

41
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:34,934
I'm sorry, it's just
I... I think I get it.

42
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:37,868
The reason why you can see me,
the reason why you can hear me.

43
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:40,968
You're dead.

44
00:02:43,342 --> 00:02:44,501
I beg your pardon?

45
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,400
Your wife...
she got you with the knife.

46
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:51,767
I'm guessing she was
on top of you?

47
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:53,067
She got you.

48
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,400
Th-The running,

49
00:02:54,434 --> 00:02:56,734
the boulevard,
that was all after.

50
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:58,567
You're nuts.

51
00:02:58,601 --> 00:03:00,534
Quite possibly, but I'm,
I'm right about this.

52
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:02,300
You're dead, I'm dead.

53
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:03,767
We're dead.

54
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:06,801
You're dead?

55
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:08,901
I'm dead?

56
00:03:08,934 --> 00:03:10,167
Thanks, anyway.

57
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,667
I'll get a phone
somewhere else.

58
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:12,901
I-I got mugged.

59
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:15,400
Right here in
this alley.

60
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:17,067
Uh, guy was
high as a kite.

61
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,701
He pulled a gun.

62
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:20,601
Here, come on,
let me show you.

63
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:28,334
Look.

64
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,400
Ooh.
You all right?

65
00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:37,634
I just had
the oddest dream.

66
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:40,601
I'm going to assume you said
that with a straight face.

67
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:42,033
Where you going?

68
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:44,501
I'm going to call
the authorities.

69
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:46,100
Come on.

70
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:47,300
It's Saturday night.

71
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:49,767
You already worked a pretty
long and sleepless week.

72
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:51,801
Don't you think
this'll keep till morning?

73
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,434
I'm gonna take that as a no.

74
00:03:56,467 --> 00:04:04,434
www.1000fr.com present

75
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:12,434
Capture:FRM@FADEOUT
Sync:FRM@Stiffler

76
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:54,399
Mm, beat me to
the paper again,

77
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,600
huh, you little newshound?

78
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:57,034
It's the only
day of the week

79
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:59,367
when they let the
comics be in color.

80
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,634
You don't mind if I read
the Op-Ed section before you,

81
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,500
do you?

82
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:05,001
Where's Mommy?

83
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:07,467
She had to
go into work.

84
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,101
On a Sunday?

85
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:13,600
Apparently, crime does not
work a five-day week.

86
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:15,700
Will she be
coming back soon?

87
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:16,934
Uh, I don't know.

88
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:18,268
But she said

89
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,333
she was gonna help me
with my diorama this afternoon.

90
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,268
Relax, Bridge, relax.

91
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,867
No diorama drama, okay?

92
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:29,168
I'm happy to fill in for Mommy.

93
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:30,201
There was an ATM

94
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:31,367
right around
the corner.

95
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,801
He had a receipt
in his pocket.

96
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:35,967
Apparently, he'd just
withdrawn $500.

97
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:37,700
Whoever it was took
the cash, his watch,

98
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:40,101
left everything else.

99
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:42,467
Driver's license says
his name is Morgan Turley.

100
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,268
Has his family
been notified?

101
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,367
So far, we haven't been able
to locate any.

102
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,834
What about his friends?

103
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:51,500
Most of the numbers
in his cell phone

104
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:52,767
were for take-out places.

105
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:55,400
We're still running
everything down.

106
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:56,967
Apparently,
he was self-employed.

107
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:58,367
We found a businescard.

108
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,234
Worked out of his apartment.

109
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:02,333
I fear this is not
someone a whole lot

110
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,700
of people are
going to miss.

111
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:23,434
You okay?

112
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:29,767
<i>That so doesn't look
like George Washington.</i>

113
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:31,434
Does, too.

114
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:33,934
Looks more like an old lady
in a funny hat to me.

115
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:35,767
Tell her it's George
Washington, Dad.

116
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:38,300
It is absolutely
George Washington.

117
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:40,033
In fact,
I will stake my reputation

118
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,067
as a diorama-maker
on it.

119
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,934
However, you bring up an
interesting point, Ariel,

120
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:46,133
one that many
young scholars

121
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:48,567
like yourself
have pointed out.

122
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:50,868
Apparently, any number
of our founding fathers,

123
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:52,634
when viewed in
historical paintings,

124
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:55,734
bear an uncanny resemblance
to old ladies in funny hats.

125
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:58,667
Yeah, that's what
men wore back then.

126
00:06:58,701 --> 00:06:59,701
White wigs and
weird hats.

127
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:01,100
It's not their fault

128
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,868
that's what grandmas
dress likethesedays.

129
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:05,267
Bridge, I'm sorry,

130
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,033
but grandmas don't even dress
likethatanymore.

131
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,300
I'm Morgan,
by the way.

132
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:13,100
Morgan Turley.

133
00:07:16,734 --> 00:07:19,801
No.

134
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:22,000
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

135
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,334
This is
really nuts.

136
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:24,767
No, i-it's not nuts.

137
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:28,467
It's, it's just the way
that it works.

138
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:30,033
It's me.

139
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:32,601
I've just passed on,
just like you have.

140
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:36,934
I-I, I know it sounds crazy,
but once you accept it,

141
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:41,033
once you embrace it,
it actually feels pretty good.

142
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:45,300
Come on.

143
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,868
Let me show you something.

144
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:57,200
*

145
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,400
I know it's hard to look at.

146
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:05,667
I know it's hard to accept,

147
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:08,067
but... you can't spend
the rest of forever

148
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,400
running through the streets
in your underwear.

149
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:33,000
Doesn't really look
like a millionaire, does she?

150
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:34,501
Is she?

151
00:08:34,534 --> 00:08:35,534
Well, she
will be soon.

152
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:37,067
That's Cadence Bixby.

153
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,534
She's Morgan Turley's
sole heir.

154
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:41,434
Washea millionaire?
No,

155
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:44,033
but he had a life insurance
policy worth that much,

156
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,367
and since she's
the only beneficiary,

157
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,868
she wants to offer a reward
for any information

158
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:49,367
leading to the capture
of his killer.

159
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,367
Wow.

160
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,501
Is she family?

161
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:53,534
Actually,
she barely knew him.

162
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:54,534
I don't get it.

163
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,334
Well, apparently,
our boy Morgan

164
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:57,334
really liked cats.

165
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:58,567
Ms. Bixby

166
00:08:58,601 --> 00:09:01,033
over there was just
explaining in great detail

167
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:03,167
how she rescues strays
in her free time.

168
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,234
Brings dozens of the little
critters in off the streets,

169
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:07,868
cleans them up,
tries to find them homes.

170
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:09,634
Long story short,
Morgan adopted six of them

171
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:12,200
from her
over the past two years.

172
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:14,934
Anyway, her coffee's
getting cold.

173
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:16,634
Well, wait a second.

174
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:19,434
I wanted to ask you: has
that second body turned up yet?

175
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,133
Mr. Underwear?

176
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:22,567
No, but, uh, if
I hear anything,

177
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:24,100
you'll be the
first to know.

178
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:28,200
FYI, uh, I've been asked by
Ms. Bixby to spread the word

179
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,801
there's going to be
a memorial service

180
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:32,634
for Mr. Turley at Our Lady
of Sorrows tonight at 7:00.

181
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:35,300
I hear all the coolest cats and
kittens are going to be there,

182
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:38,234
so if you're hoping to get a
good seat, I'd sashay in early.

183
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:39,400
Mm...

184
00:09:39,434 --> 00:09:40,467
Okay, explain it

185
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:42,000
to me one more time
why you're going

186
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:44,300
to a memorial service for a man
that you didn't even know.

187
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,400
Because he has no one.

188
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:49,234
He's leaving all his money
to a perfect stranger,

189
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:50,801
for goodness' sake.

190
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:53,934
And that's your
problem because...?

191
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,334
Well, he's not leaving
the money to you, is he?

192
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:59,033
Look, I've been dreaming
about this man for, what,

193
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:00,234
two days now?

194
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,300
Presumably,
there's a reason.

195
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:04,634
Maybe it's to help figure out
who did this to him.

196
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,701
Or maybe it's to be there
when the few people

197
00:10:06,734 --> 00:10:08,133
that he encountered
in his life

198
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:10,200
gather together
to say good-bye.

199
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,567
I'm not smart enough
to know.

200
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:13,968
But I have been doing this
long enough to know

201
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,234
that something
about this man--

202
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:18,167
his or his death,
maybe-- matters.

203
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,601
Yeah, it's just that yesterday
you weren't home.

204
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:21,634
Tonight, you're going out.

205
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,100
Which reminds me.

206
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,000
I saw Bridgette's diorama
in the kitchen.

207
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:26,501
Who's the old lady
in the boat?

208
00:10:26,534 --> 00:10:28,167
You don't get to do that.

209
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,300
What? Did I say something wrong?

210
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:32,400
If you're not here,
you don't get to critique.

211
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:33,501
(laughs)
Har-dee-har-har.

212
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:34,934
It wasn't an old
lady in the boat?

213
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:35,968
That's George Washington,

214
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,033
the father of our country,

215
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:38,701
and if you don't like
the way he looks,

216
00:10:38,734 --> 00:10:40,033
I'm sorry.
then you should stay home

217
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:41,701
the next time your daughter
has a project.

218
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:42,968
Okay, I'm sorry,
I didn't know.

219
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,534
They all looked like that
back then.

220
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:46,801
Joe, I'm sorry.

221
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:47,968
I'd like to thank

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,934
Pastor Grimes again
for his lovely eulogy.

223
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:54,767
And for allowing me to get up
here and say a few words

224
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:56,667
about my good friend, Morgan.

225
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:59,267
Morgan was a quiet man,

226
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,534
a shy man.

227
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:06,567
Deep down, I guess...
a lonely man.

228
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:11,067
He kept mostly
to himself.

229
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,167
It took time to get
to know Morgan.

230
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,801
It took effort.

231
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:22,801
We grew up together,
so I had an advantage.

232
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,901
We knew each
other's secrets.

233
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,767
And one of Morgan's
biggest secrets

234
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:31,501
was that he was happiest
by himself.

235
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:35,767
Happiest in his apartment.

236
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:38,801
Once or twice a month, I
could usually drag him out

237
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:41,334
to a movie or
a ball game.

238
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,067
But that was it
for him.

239
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,968
Pleasure in
small doses.

240
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,300
That was all
he could handle.

241
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,300
I'm gonna miss him.

242
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:57,901
The talks after we would
leave the theater.

243
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:01,534
Or just sitting
in his apartment,

244
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:04,701
staring out the window.

245
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:07,100
His favorite way to deal
with the world.

246
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:10,432
Good-bye Morgan.

247
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:12,299
You were a good man

248
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,799
and a great friend.

249
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:17,164
Mr. Turley?

250
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:22,589
I'm glad you were
able to see this.

251
00:12:22,623 --> 00:12:24,290
I'm glad that you
were able to see

252
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:25,890
that people really do care.

253
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:33,489
You can see me?

254
00:12:33,522 --> 00:12:34,990
You know that I'm here?

255
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,422
This is weird.

256
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:39,823
You don't look dead.

257
00:12:39,856 --> 00:12:41,090
I'm not.

258
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:42,856
It's a long story.

259
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,756
But don't worry;
I'm the only one.

260
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:48,357
Actually, I'm with the
District Attorney's office.

261
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:50,190
And I want to take
this opportunity

262
00:12:50,223 --> 00:12:52,990
to assure you we are
going to find the person

263
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,357
who did this to you.

264
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:57,689
We are going to punish the
person who did this to you.

265
00:12:59,756 --> 00:13:01,956
You know, it's okay
if you don't.

266
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,156
Excuse me?

267
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:10,075
I got to believe you've got
better things to do.

268
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:14,090
I mean, you find the person
that did this to me,

269
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:15,723
it's not going
to change anything.

270
00:13:15,756 --> 00:13:17,522
I'm still
going to be dead.

271
00:13:17,556 --> 00:13:20,190
You deserve justice,
Mr. Turley.

272
00:13:20,223 --> 00:13:21,823
And we certainly
don't want

273
00:13:21,856 --> 00:13:23,923
whoever did this to
you to do it again.

274
00:13:23,956 --> 00:13:25,257
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about that.

275
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,456
I don't think he would.

276
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:31,456
I got the distinct impression
that this was a one-time thing.

277
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:39,623
Well, on the off-chance
that you're wrong,

278
00:13:39,656 --> 00:13:41,856
is there anything
you can tell me

279
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,890
about this man?

280
00:13:49,026 --> 00:13:50,526
He rebuffed you?

281
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:51,594
He rebuffed me.

282
00:13:51,627 --> 00:13:52,826
I looked down
for a second

283
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:54,260
to get something
out of my purse,

284
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,493
and he was gone.

285
00:13:55,527 --> 00:13:56,793
The nerve of some ghosts.

286
00:13:56,826 --> 00:13:58,793
He looked so threatened,

287
00:13:58,826 --> 00:14:01,360
like I was some kind
of problem or something.

288
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:03,653
Well, who knows?

289
00:14:03,686 --> 00:14:04,786
Maybe he was embarrassed.

290
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,187
Embarrassed by what?

291
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,452
Well, the guy's at his
own memorial service.

292
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:12,653
He's spying on his friends,

293
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,120
listening to what they
had to say about him.

294
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:17,452
It's a little narcissistic,
it's a little embarrassing

295
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:18,686
if you get caught at it.

296
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:20,553
I just wanted him to know
that I cared.

297
00:14:20,586 --> 00:14:21,786
I just want him
to know

298
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,419
that whoever did this
to him

299
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:25,220
wasn't simply going
to get away with it.

300
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:26,719
All right, I
get that, I do,

301
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:28,220
and I'm sure
that he does, too,

302
00:14:28,253 --> 00:14:29,853
so just be patient.

303
00:14:29,886 --> 00:14:31,287
If he really wants your help,

304
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:34,053
I'm sure he'll
come asking for it.

305
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:36,120
I certainly would
if I were dead.

306
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:41,352
She really did it.

307
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:42,920
I'm sorry.

308
00:14:42,953 --> 00:14:45,220
I just thought...

309
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:47,108
you seemed like you really
needed to see the truth.

310
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,386
It seemed like you were having
a hard time accepting.

311
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:50,686
Oh.

312
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:52,486
My grandfath's watch.

313
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,519
Killing me wasn't enough.

314
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:57,352
She had to make me
break that watch.

315
00:14:57,386 --> 00:14:59,287
This watch?

316
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:01,886
This is a hundred-
year-old watch.

317
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,753
My Grandpa DiScala,
he gave it to me

318
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:07,519
on his deathbed.

319
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:10,419
Let it go, Vincent.

320
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,786
We don't need watches
where we're going.

321
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:16,287
Why, Gladys?!

322
00:15:22,352 --> 00:15:25,287
All right, I know
you hated me,

323
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:27,187
but I never knew you
hated me this much.

324
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,220
You know...

325
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:40,086
for a fellow
murder victim,

326
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,053
you're being pretty Zen
about all this.

327
00:15:44,086 --> 00:15:45,519
I'm dead.

328
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:46,786
Why shouldn't I be Zen?

329
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,086
Aren't you ticked?

330
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,820
Don't you want to get
the guy who killed you?

331
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:52,953
I'm beyond all that now;
you should be, too.

332
00:15:58,153 --> 00:16:00,220
What happened to you, anyway?

333
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:01,352
Mugging, huh?

334
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:06,586
Well... um, not exactly.

335
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:08,686
What do you mean,
"not exactly"?

336
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,719
How'd you end up getting
shot in that alley?

337
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:13,786
I... it's kind of a...

338
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,653
a long story actually.

339
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:19,220
Look at me, friend.

340
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:22,086
I got nothing but time, right?

341
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,352
You know what?

342
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:25,686
I'd rather show you
than tell you.

343
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,586
We have to go
somewhere else now?

344
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,786
My apartment, yeah.

345
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:39,020
Uh, seriously,
Vincent...

346
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:41,020
I'm not sure
that you want to see this.

347
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:50,786
Oh... all
right, fine.

348
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
Your apartment, it is.

349
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,619
Vincent and Gladys DiScala.

350
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,187
Got it.

351
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,753
Anything else?

352
00:17:04,786 --> 00:17:07,586
She cut him up with a saw;
that's why we can't find him.

353
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,120
No way to get a warrant,

354
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,386
but once I have an address,
I could certainly swing by

355
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:13,419
and ask a few questions
about her husband's whereabouts.

356
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:14,786
You want to come with?

357
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,120
Can't.

358
00:17:16,153 --> 00:17:17,586
I'm on my way
to Morgan Turley's apartment.

359
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,920
What for?

360
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:21,386
Well, in that same dream,
Morgan started to suggest

361
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:24,120
that maybe there was more
to it than just a mugging.

362
00:17:24,153 --> 00:17:27,586
And then he said
he'd rather show Vincent

363
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,686
why he was killed than tell him.

364
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:32,419
He made it sound like the answer
was somewhere in his apartment.

365
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:33,820
I just...

366
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,319
I just want to take a look.

367
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:04,486
Hey, kitty, kitty.

368
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:07,719
Oh, kitty.

369
00:18:19,586 --> 00:18:22,786
Can I help you
with something?

370
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,953
Hello again.

371
00:18:24,986 --> 00:18:26,287
Hello.

372
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:28,753
Is there something
I can help you with?

373
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:31,753
I was just looking
at this chair.

374
00:18:31,786 --> 00:18:34,320
I was wondering why it was
pointing towards the window.

375
00:18:34,353 --> 00:18:36,486
I like looking
out the window.

376
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,020
I've always liked
looking out the window,

377
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:39,619
ever since
I was a little boy.

378
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:41,486
Anything else?

379
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,552
No, I...

380
00:18:43,586 --> 00:18:45,686
Do you want me to call someone
about your cats?

381
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:47,486
Maybe that wom you left
the money to?

382
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:50,853
I'm sure you want them
to find good homes.

383
00:18:50,886 --> 00:18:52,519
No, don't call her.

384
00:18:52,552 --> 00:18:54,953
I don't want her to see
where I lived.

385
00:18:54,986 --> 00:18:57,653
Somebody else,
call somebody else.

386
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:02,287
What? Why are you looking
at me like that?

387
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,653
I don't know.

388
00:19:03,686 --> 00:19:06,719
I asked you if you could tell me
anything about your killer

389
00:19:06,753 --> 00:19:08,686
the other day,
and you just disappeared.

390
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:10,053
I apologize.

391
00:19:10,086 --> 00:19:13,953
I... I was confused.

392
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,053
You are alive
but you could see me.

393
00:19:16,086 --> 00:19:18,387
I didn't understand
about people like you.

394
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,853
I'm sorry if I frightened you.

395
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:24,152
It's okay.

396
00:19:24,153 --> 00:19:26,220
You look nervous.

397
00:19:26,253 --> 00:19:28,519
I'm not nervous.

398
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,719
It's awfully dark in here.

399
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,786
You afraid someone's
going to see you?

400
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:43,686
Hey, wait a second,
isn't that her?

401
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:46,253
Isn't that the woman
we were just talking about,

402
00:19:46,287 --> 00:19:47,886
the one you left
all that money to?

403
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,220
The one who said
that she barely knew you?

404
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:53,686
Cadence... something?

405
00:19:54,517 --> 00:19:57,230
???

406
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,833
??? ne tonight
as police continue to find

407
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:09,866
small pieces
of Glendale resident

408
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,400
Vincent DiScala buried
throughout the backyard

409
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:13,767
of his home.

410
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:16,434
His wife, Gladys DiScala,
is being taken into custody,

411
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:18,434
but so far police refuse

412
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,367
to discuss the specifics
of the evidence

413
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,300
against her at this time.

414
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,734
I don't quite know how
I'm going to break this

415
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,367
to poor Bridge.

416
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,467
I don't think we
have enough magnets

417
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,133
to stick this "A+" diorama

418
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,866
depicting the father
of our country

419
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,900
to the refrigerator.

420
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:42,033
Hmm.

421
00:20:44,434 --> 00:20:46,500
Did I mention the "A+"?

422
00:20:46,534 --> 00:20:48,133
I just don't get it.

423
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:50,667
Why wouldn't he want to tell me
who did this to him?

424
00:20:50,701 --> 00:20:52,167
Give me a description?

425
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,233
Tell me what really happened?

426
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:56,767
Because he doesn't
want you to know.

427
00:20:57,866 --> 00:20:59,567
But why?

428
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,933
Why would a person
in their right mind

429
00:21:00,966 --> 00:21:02,833
not want their
killer found?

430
00:21:02,866 --> 00:21:04,567
Don't you find
it mystifying?

431
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,334
Uh, no. What I
find mystifying

432
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:08,500
is your insistence
on helping this man,

433
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,400
despite the fact that
he doesn't want it.

434
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:13,233
He's dead.

435
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:15,167
Let him lie in peace.

436
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,767
For that matr,

437
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:20,300
how about the two
of us lying in peace?

438
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:22,701
That makes no sense,
that's crazy.

439
00:21:22,734 --> 00:21:25,367
Why protect the person
who ended your life?

440
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,534
That's crazy?

441
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:28,966
How about leaving
everything you have

442
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,634
to a woman that
you barely knew?

443
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,634
A woman you say this
guy peeped on every day?

444
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,966
Consider the
source, Allison.

445
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,667
Yeah, well...

446
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:48,033
I love you, too.

447
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,667
What's the deal with the cats?

448
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:53,400
What do you mean "What's
the deal with the cats"?

449
00:21:53,434 --> 00:21:54,767
They're cats.
Don't you like cats?

450
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:56,334
Not really.

451
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:58,167
But I guess you do, huh?

452
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,833
I'm allergic, actually.

453
00:21:59,866 --> 00:22:02,167
What? Then how come
you got so many?

454
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,634
I mean,hadso many.

455
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:06,500
You ever been
in love, Vincent?

456
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,334
I don't know.

457
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:12,300
Given the events of
the past few days,

458
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:14,167
and, uh, given
the circumstances

459
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,000
of my present condition,

460
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:17,900
I have to say I would like

461
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:20,500
to think about that
before I answer. Why?

462
00:22:27,734 --> 00:22:29,701
Her?

463
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,300
Looks like
she had a party.

464
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:34,866
She's got a lot
to celebrate.

465
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,634
She just came
into a lot of money.

466
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:39,966
Good for her.
Yup.

467
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,634
Left her everything I had.

468
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:45,133
I don't get it.

469
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:46,900
What's not to get?
Look at her.

470
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:49,833
Okay, but she's alive,

471
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:52,866
and you're kind
of indisposed.

472
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:57,966
Are you trying to tell
me that she may have had

473
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,734
something to do
with your...

474
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:01,367
untimely passing?

475
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:05,000
It wasn't untimely, Vincent.

476
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:07,900
It was precisely timed.
It was perfectly timed.

477
00:23:08,966 --> 00:23:10,667
Wait a second.

478
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:12,734
Are you trying
to tell me that she's
the one who shot you?

479
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:15,167
You want to hear
the whole story?

480
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,467
You want to hear all about it?

481
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,067
Okay.

482
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,833
Hang on a second.

483
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:23,600
I think somebody else is here.

484
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:25,634
Somebody is listening to us.

485
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,600
It's you, isn't it?

486
00:23:29,634 --> 00:23:31,801
Nobody invited you here.

487
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,300
Wake up!

488
00:23:33,334 --> 00:23:34,801
Did you hear me?

489
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:37,133
I said "Wake up." Wake up!

490
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:41,133
Get your head
out of my... death.

491
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:44,300
You want me to give you
a bad dream?

492
00:23:44,334 --> 00:23:46,734
Okay. You asked for it.

493
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:02,167
That is so not fair.

494
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:08,966
Morgan Turley was in
love with the cat lady.

495
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,200
Cadence Bixby?

496
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:13,033
When I heard about
that million dollars

497
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:14,667
he left her, I had a hunch
he might have been

498
00:24:14,701 --> 00:24:16,300
more hot than cold on her.

499
00:24:16,334 --> 00:24:18,233
I think he overplayed
his hand though.

500
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:19,400
It's kind of tough
to close the deal

501
00:24:19,434 --> 00:24:20,767
from where he is,
don't you think?

502
00:24:20,801 --> 00:24:22,167
I think she may have
seduced him, talked him

503
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,267
into getting that ridiculous
life insurance policy,

504
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,767
and then killed him.

505
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:27,267
Can we talk to her?

506
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:32,434
Ms. Bixby?

507
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm District
Attorney Devalos.

508
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:37,133
This is Allison Dubois.

509
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:38,467
Of course, you
already know

510
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,900
Detective Scanlon.
We very much

511
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:41,667
appreciate you coming
down to speak with us.

512
00:24:41,701 --> 00:24:42,767
Now you've gone too far.

513
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:44,933
This woman had nothing
to do with anything.

514
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:46,267
Your assistant on the phone
said you wanted

515
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,866
to talk to me about what
happened to poor Mr. Turley?

516
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,833
Has someone come forward
with new information?

517
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:53,467
Are they trying to claim
the reward money that I offered?

518
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,033
Let's talk in the
conference room please.

519
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:00,900
Do you want me
to give you bad dreams

520
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,300
every night for the rest
of your life?

521
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,467
And that would change
my life how, exactly?

522
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,367
I'm begging you,
put a stop to this.

523
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,866
No good can come of this.

524
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,801
Tell me what really
happened in that alley.

525
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:10,933
Who shot you?

526
00:25:10,966 --> 00:25:12,434
Why? Why do you care?

527
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:13,667
You ever heard of the expression

528
00:25:13,701 --> 00:25:16,167
"die in peace"?

529
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,100
Ms. Bixby, it's

530
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:20,167
my understanding that when you
came to see Detective Scanlon

531
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,334
the other day, you told him you
hardly knew Morgan Turley.

532
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:26,033
That's true.
I run a small,

533
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,500
non-profit
shelter for cats.

534
00:25:27,534 --> 00:25:31,033
I take in strays,
try to find them homes.

535
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:33,267
One day, Mr. Turley just
walked through the door.

536
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,067
Said he loved cats, was
wondering if he could adopt one.

537
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,400
Is that a crime?

538
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:39,334
And that's it?

539
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:42,500
That's the extent
of your relationship?

540
00:25:42,534 --> 00:25:44,966
Well, it actually
happened a number of times.

541
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,300
I believe he ultimately
ended up adopting

542
00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:48,534
about a half dozen strays.

543
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:51,300
Sounds like a nice man.

544
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:52,767
He seemed so.

545
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,233
Ms. Bixby, didn't
you find it odd

546
00:25:54,267 --> 00:25:55,866
that someone you barely knew

547
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,467
would leave you
so much money?

548
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,866
Of course.

549
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,467
It's been overwhelming.

550
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,067
Morgan Turley has
changed my life.

551
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,200
I can only guess
that the cats

552
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:07,300
I placed with him
gave him great joy,

553
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:09,634
that he was looking
for a way to say thank you,

554
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:13,300
to support the work that made
those adoptions possible,

555
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:17,100
But why leave that money
to you, specifically?

556
00:26:17,133 --> 00:26:19,334
He didn't leave
it to your shelter.

557
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:21,600
He didn't leave it
to any of the bigger,

558
00:26:21,634 --> 00:26:24,067
better known organizations
that do similar work.

559
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,567
What do you mean "why"?

560
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,367
Because I trust her.

561
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,933
Because it was my money.

562
00:26:28,966 --> 00:26:31,300
I could do whatever the hell
I wanted to with it.

563
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:33,833
Oh, my goodness.

564
00:26:33,866 --> 00:26:35,701
You think that I
might have something

565
00:26:35,734 --> 00:26:37,100
to do with his murder,

566
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:39,133
don't you?
No. No one's saying that.

567
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,801
We're exploring all
sorts of possibilities,

568
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,100
but it'd be helpful
if you could tell us

569
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,000
where you were this
past Saturday night.

570
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:47,500
Is there anyone
who can vouch for
your whereabouts?

571
00:26:47,534 --> 00:26:50,133
No.

572
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,966
I was home.

573
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,434
But I was by myself.

574
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,734
Am I in trouble?

575
00:26:57,767 --> 00:26:59,067
Do I need a lawyer?

576
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:08,534
I'm begging you--
look at her.

577
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:10,167
Is that the face
of a killer?

578
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,866
Is that the face of
a person who could

579
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,767
pull the trigger on
another human being?

580
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:16,300
She rescues pussycats
for God's sake!

581
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,000
So you never
had any contact

582
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:20,367
with Mr. Turley
outside of the shelter?

583
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,133
You didn't know him
in any context

584
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:25,933
except as a man who was
interested in adopting cats?

585
00:27:25,966 --> 00:27:27,900
When they first called
to tell me he had passed away

586
00:27:27,933 --> 00:27:30,167
and left me his
insurance money,

587
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,767
I couldn't even
remember who he was.

588
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:33,866
What did I tell you?
Come on, Mrs. Dubois.

589
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,966
You can put a
stop to this.

590
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,767
You can do it.

591
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:40,133
Did you know you
were neighbors?
Oh, no.

592
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:42,801
No, no, no.
Don't tell her that!
Really?

593
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:45,367
I believe he lived directly
across the street from you.

594
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,966
And who knows, maybe you can
see his apartment from yours?

595
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,833
Wouldn't that be
an amazing coincidence.

596
00:27:50,866 --> 00:27:53,334
And maybe he could see

597
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:56,167
your apartment from his.

598
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,567
Oh.

599
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,334
Okay. I give.

600
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:03,033
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

601
00:28:03,067 --> 00:28:04,567
Just don't tell
her anything else.

602
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,534
Don't ask her
anything else.

603
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:08,634
Isn't there any way
we can check on that?

604
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:09,966
Excuse yourself.

605
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,801
Right now. Let's go
out into the hallway,

606
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:13,933
and I'll tell
you everything.
Perhaps.

607
00:28:13,966 --> 00:28:15,267
Can you excuse me a second?

608
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,701
I need to step outside.

609
00:28:16,734 --> 00:28:18,833
I need to check on something.
I'll be right back.

610
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,801
I did it.
You did what?

611
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:24,900
I killed myself.

612
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:26,067
You did not.

613
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,233
Did, too.

614
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:28,334
Cross my heart and hope to die.

615
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:29,600
Ask anybody who knows me.

616
00:28:29,634 --> 00:28:31,334
I've always talked
about killing myself.

617
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:33,767
That's not funny,
and that's not true.

618
00:28:33,801 --> 00:28:35,233
There's nothing
about your injuries

619
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:36,767
that are consistent
with suicide.

620
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:38,434
Besides, everyone knows,

621
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,767
life insurance doesn't
pay off on suicides.

622
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:42,833
If you prove it was a suicide.

623
00:28:42,866 --> 00:28:44,434
Which we can't because it isn't.

624
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:46,000
Well, then...

625
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:47,534
I guess we're at a standoff.

626
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:50,267
Really? I was just
thinking of taking Cadence

627
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,767
for a little tour of your place.

628
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:53,701
Checking out the cats,
showing her

629
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:55,434
your view from your
living room window.

630
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,767
No!

631
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:59,033
Yes!
Oh, no.

632
00:28:59,067 --> 00:29:02,100
Don't tell me you're
dragging him into this, too?

633
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm sorry to
bother you.

634
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,300
Do you work here?

635
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:06,933
Yes, I do.

636
00:29:06,966 --> 00:29:09,133
I'm looking for
my fianc, Cadence?

637
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:10,400
Cadence Bixby?

638
00:29:10,434 --> 00:29:12,567
Your fianc?
Your fianc?

639
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,966
Do you know where
she might be?

640
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,267
She's right in there.

641
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,300
Thanks.

642
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,567
You never told me that
Cadence and Nick were...

643
00:29:28,878 --> 00:29:30,978
That's it, I'm done.

644
00:29:31,012 --> 00:29:32,878
The guy doesn't care
about catching his killer,

645
00:29:32,912 --> 00:29:34,945
why should I?

646
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:38,745
It's just so strange.

647
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:41,112
You'd think the way he
always kept an eye on her,

648
00:29:41,145 --> 00:29:43,878
he'd have a clue that she was
involved with his best friend.

649
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:46,412
Do I feel sorry
for the guy? Absolutely.

650
00:29:46,446 --> 00:29:50,379
Am I gonna lose any more
sleep over him? No.

651
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:52,212
Me, either.

652
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:58,611
Okay.

653
00:29:58,645 --> 00:30:01,245
I'm ready.

654
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,312
Pull the trigger.

655
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:06,312
You sure about this?

656
00:30:14,978 --> 00:30:18,711
Don't back out on me, Nick.

657
00:30:18,745 --> 00:30:20,345
Please.

658
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:22,312
I'm begging you.

659
00:30:25,245 --> 00:30:26,611
With friends

660
00:30:26,645 --> 00:30:28,112
like that, huh?

661
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,745
I don't understand.

662
00:30:32,778 --> 00:30:34,845
Morgan wanted to die?

663
00:30:34,878 --> 00:30:36,745
That was before he knew
his best pal

664
00:30:36,778 --> 00:30:39,279
was shacking up
with the girl he loved.

665
00:30:39,312 --> 00:30:41,645
Now, I think he's having
second thoughts.

666
00:30:43,397 --> 00:30:46,045
Did you send me
that dream, Mr. DiScala?

667
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,912
I know you've been
trying to help him.

668
00:30:48,945 --> 00:30:51,912
Considering the hit
the poor guy took today,

669
00:30:51,945 --> 00:30:54,212
I thought you ought
to know the truth.

670
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,578
You okay?

671
00:31:17,611 --> 00:31:19,012
Vincent filled me in,

672
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:21,045
showed me what really
happened in that alley.

673
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:31,912
But why, Morgan?

674
00:31:31,945 --> 00:31:33,945
Why would you do that?

675
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:39,745
I loved
Cadence Bixby.

676
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:43,512
From the moment I laid eyes
on her, through this window,

677
00:31:43,546 --> 00:31:45,945
I loved Cadence Bixby.

678
00:31:45,978 --> 00:31:48,512
I watched her up
here for months--

679
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:50,546
getting ready for
work in the morning,

680
00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:52,512
coming home from
work in the evening--

681
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:53,878
and I thought
to myself,

682
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,345
"My God, if I could just
get close to this woman,

683
00:31:57,379 --> 00:32:01,112
if I could just matter
to this woman."

684
00:32:01,145 --> 00:32:02,245
And then,

685
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,546
I decided to
follow her.

686
00:32:04,578 --> 00:32:07,212
I wanted to know more than
what I saw from up here--

687
00:32:07,245 --> 00:32:10,379
where she worked,
where she ate.

688
00:32:10,412 --> 00:32:12,112
And then I discovered
the shelter.

689
00:32:12,145 --> 00:32:15,546
It took me weeks to get up
the courage to go in.

690
00:32:15,578 --> 00:32:17,145
And once I did,

691
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:20,012
once I was actually
close to her,

692
00:32:20,045 --> 00:32:23,446
she was even more beautiful,
more special.

693
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:27,512
And I never knew what to do,
and I never knew what to say.

694
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:30,546
I just kept
adopting cats.

695
00:32:30,578 --> 00:32:33,079
It was the one
thing that worked.

696
00:32:33,112 --> 00:32:36,112
Whenever I did it, she'd
be mine for a half hour.

697
00:32:36,145 --> 00:32:40,412
Asong as it took to fill out
the paperwork, she'd be mi.

698
00:32:40,446 --> 00:32:41,912
But that still
doesn't explain...

699
00:32:41,945 --> 00:32:44,412
Doesn't it?

700
00:32:44,446 --> 00:32:46,611
I showed her to him--

701
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:50,045
right here, a little
more than a year ago.

702
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,212
I thought if he saw her, he
could understand why she was

703
00:32:54,245 --> 00:32:56,578
the only thing I
ever talked about.

704
00:32:56,611 --> 00:32:58,778
I guess he understood
more than I knew.

705
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:02,045
I can't believe
he kept that from you,

706
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,778
knowing what you were
planning to do.

707
00:33:03,812 --> 00:33:06,279
<i>But it was his
plan, Mrs. Dubois.</i>

708
00:33:06,312 --> 00:33:07,812
It was his idea.

709
00:33:07,845 --> 00:33:10,611
The million-dollar insurance
policy, the staged mugging--

710
00:33:10,645 --> 00:33:11,711
it was all his idea.

711
00:33:11,745 --> 00:33:12,945
He just talked
me into it.

712
00:33:12,978 --> 00:33:16,145
This doesn't make sense.

713
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:19,878
How can anyone possibly talk you
into letting them kill you?

714
00:33:21,945 --> 00:33:25,179
I'd been threatening to do it
to myself for years.

715
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:28,279
Suddenly, it all made sense.

716
00:33:28,312 --> 00:33:30,711
I could put myself
out of the pain I was in

717
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:33,945
and give her
this remarkable gift.

718
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,412
I would matter to her.

719
00:33:38,645 --> 00:33:40,412
And little did you know,

720
00:33:40,446 --> 00:33:42,645
all that money wouldn't
just be going to Cadence.

721
00:33:42,678 --> 00:33:45,611
It would eventually find
its way to her new husband,

722
00:33:45,645 --> 00:33:48,479
your best friend, Nick.

723
00:33:48,512 --> 00:33:52,446
I'm really depressed.

724
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:55,912
I haven't felt
this suicidal since...

725
00:33:55,945 --> 00:33:58,079
since I was alive.

726
00:33:58,112 --> 00:34:02,479
Well, maybe there's something
we can do about that.

727
00:34:08,264 --> 00:34:09,564
Where is she?

728
00:34:09,598 --> 00:34:12,030
Ms. Bixby is waiting for you
in the conference room.

729
00:34:12,064 --> 00:34:13,598
I believe you know the way.

730
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:30,031
Cade...

731
00:34:30,064 --> 00:34:31,264
I don't know
what these people

732
00:34:31,298 --> 00:34:32,497
have been filling
your head with,

733
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:36,630
but I'm here to tell you
it's not true.

734
00:34:36,664 --> 00:34:38,730
I called a lawyer;
he's on his way.

735
00:34:38,764 --> 00:34:41,197
But I don't
understand.

736
00:34:41,231 --> 00:34:44,064
Why would you
do that, Nick?

737
00:34:44,097 --> 00:34:46,630
If everything they
told me wasn't true,

738
00:34:46,664 --> 00:34:48,197
why would you even
need a lawyer?

739
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:50,530
Come on.

740
00:34:50,563 --> 00:34:51,697
Let's talk about this outside.

741
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,197
What's wrong
with right here?

742
00:34:53,231 --> 00:34:56,797
We don't have
anything to hide.

743
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,231
Do we?

744
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:00,298
Cadence was just telling us
how odd she found it

745
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,164
that it wasn't until
Morgan passed away

746
00:35:02,197 --> 00:35:04,463
that you even mentioned
that he was your friend.

747
00:35:05,387 --> 00:35:07,596
Darling...

748
00:35:07,597 --> 00:35:09,263
I explained that already.

749
00:35:09,296 --> 00:35:11,730
He and I weren't
getting along.

750
00:35:11,763 --> 00:35:13,697
We weren't speaking,
that's all.

751
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,697
I loved him,

752
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:17,563
but he was a depressed,
moody guy.

753
00:35:17,597 --> 00:35:19,830
If I'd known you two had
already met through the shelter,

754
00:35:19,863 --> 00:35:21,296
don't you think
I would've told you?

755
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,697
I wish you had.

756
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,463
Because considering
the amount of money

757
00:35:25,496 --> 00:35:28,730
he was planning on leaving
me, it would've been nice

758
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:31,763
to get to know him
a little better.

759
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,830
Maybe even have him
over for dinner.

760
00:35:33,863 --> 00:35:36,296
Now, that would have been
a fascinating dinner.

761
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,096
You, your best friend,

762
00:35:38,129 --> 00:35:39,997
and the woman you were seeing
behind his back.

763
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,496
Might have made it
more difficult

764
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,863
convincing him to let you
shoot him, though.

765
00:35:43,897 --> 00:35:47,597
Look, Morgan was killed
by a stranger,

766
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,163
a mugger.

767
00:35:49,196 --> 00:35:51,463
I know you're under
a lot of pressure.

768
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:54,129
I'm sorry you're having trouble
finding the person who did this.

769
00:35:54,163 --> 00:35:56,129
But if you think
I'm gonna stand here

770
00:35:56,163 --> 00:35:58,797
and let you
accuse me of...

771
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,930
of hurting my friend...

772
00:35:59,964 --> 00:36:02,663
Funny thing about muggings,
Mr. Lewin--

773
00:36:02,697 --> 00:36:03,930
the money that gets stolen

774
00:36:03,964 --> 00:36:05,563
often doesn't stay
with the mugger very long.

775
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:07,064
It gets spent.

776
00:36:07,096 --> 00:36:09,997
Which is unfortunate, because
it frequently contains evidence

777
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,863
that connects the mugger
to the crime.

778
00:36:12,897 --> 00:36:14,229
SCANLON:
At the very least,

779
00:36:14,263 --> 00:36:16,763
you might find
the perpetrator's fingerprints.

780
00:36:16,797 --> 00:36:19,030
At most, if it was a violent
mugging, there could be

781
00:36:19,064 --> 00:36:21,064
microscopic amounts of blood
spatter from the victim.

782
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,463
Can't get much more violent
than a bullet to the brain,

783
00:36:23,496 --> 00:36:24,830
can you, Mr. Lewin?

784
00:36:24,863 --> 00:36:27,797
You know,

785
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,797
I wish you could find the money.

786
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,563
You know why?

787
00:36:31,597 --> 00:36:33,830
Because I know if it had
that evidence on it,

788
00:36:33,863 --> 00:36:35,797
that blood you're talking about,

789
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,330
it would absolutely
prove my innocence.

790
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:39,196
Unfortunately,
for both of us,

791
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:41,330
you're probably right.

792
00:36:41,363 --> 00:36:42,597
It probably was spent.

793
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,263
Which means it could be
anywhere by now.

794
00:36:44,296 --> 00:36:46,396
Well, maybe not anywhere.

795
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,430
Turns out the $500

796
00:36:48,463 --> 00:36:51,129
Mr. Turley withdrew
from that ATM was spent

797
00:36:51,163 --> 00:36:54,663
at a pawn shop downtown the very
same night he was murdered.

798
00:36:54,697 --> 00:36:58,263
The owner said he only made
one sale that night-- a ring.

799
00:36:58,296 --> 00:37:00,363
A modest engagement ring.

800
00:37:02,396 --> 00:37:06,363
That couldn't possibly be
this ring, right?

801
00:37:06,396 --> 00:37:07,763
You said this belonged

802
00:37:07,797 --> 00:37:10,129
to yourlate mother

803
00:37:10,163 --> 00:37:11,229
That's right, it did.

804
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:13,263
Well, that's peculiar,

805
00:37:13,296 --> 00:37:15,129
because when we showed
your picture to the owner,

806
00:37:15,163 --> 00:37:17,897
he identified you as the only
customer he had that evening.

807
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,263
He even let a few of

808
00:37:19,296 --> 00:37:20,997
our lab techs take a look
at the money

809
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,363
that was still
in the cash register.

810
00:37:22,396 --> 00:37:24,096
We found the evidence
we were looking for

811
00:37:24,129 --> 00:37:26,096
on this 20, Mr. Lewin.

812
00:37:26,129 --> 00:37:28,463
Morgan's blood,
your fingerprints.

813
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,530
Mr. Lewin, you're under arrest
for the murder of Morgan Turley.

814
00:37:31,563 --> 00:37:33,730
You have the right
to remain silent.

815
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,129
Anything you say
can and will be used

816
00:37:35,163 --> 00:37:36,363
against you
in a court of law.

817
00:37:36,396 --> 00:37:37,363
I don't understand.

818
00:37:37,396 --> 00:37:38,430
You have the right to counsel...

819
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:40,997
I didn't tell anyone
I went to that shop.

820
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,630
How could you possibly...?

821
00:37:42,663 --> 00:37:43,930
We received a tip

822
00:37:43,964 --> 00:37:46,630
late last night that pretty much
gave us everything we needed.

823
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:48,163
From who?

824
00:37:48,196 --> 00:37:49,430
From someone who knows

825
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:51,363
what it means to be a friend.

826
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:54,763
From someone who knows
what it means to be loyal.

827
00:38:30,463 --> 00:38:32,496
You did the right
thing, you know.

828
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,463
I know.

829
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,997
I just...

830
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,430
I hate to see
her so sad.

831
00:38:38,463 --> 00:38:40,897
Plus, now the
insurance company's

832
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:44,263
gonna make her give
back the money.

833
00:38:44,296 --> 00:38:46,763
I really did a
horrible thing.

834
00:38:46,797 --> 00:38:48,129
I don't know.

835
00:38:48,163 --> 00:38:51,797
This Cadence girl--
least as far as I can tell--

836
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,296
she doesn't strike me
as the kind

837
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,064
who gets too hung up on money.

838
00:38:56,096 --> 00:38:59,630
I mean, I'm sure
she's gonna miss it,

839
00:38:59,663 --> 00:39:03,463
but I have a feeling that
what she'll always remember

840
00:39:03,496 --> 00:39:05,330
is that once upon a time,

841
00:39:05,363 --> 00:39:08,229
there was a man who cared
so deeply about her,

842
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,797
he was actually willing
to give up everything

843
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:14,129
for her.

844
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:16,830
I think that's
a pretty good thing.

845
00:39:16,863 --> 00:39:19,530
It ain't a million bucks.

846
00:39:19,563 --> 00:39:22,196
But I think that's
a pretty good thing.

847
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:24,897
Now, come on.

848
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:29,163
I'm getting a little
sick of this view.

849
00:39:29,196 --> 00:39:32,263
What say we both move

850
00:39:32,296 --> 00:39:34,263
onward and upward,
if you know what I mean?

851
00:39:36,964 --> 00:39:40,530
You know, Vincent, I'm
really glad we met.

852
00:39:40,563 --> 00:39:43,096
You're a true pal.

853
00:39:43,129 --> 00:39:44,697
Likewise, Morgy.

854
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,697
Likewise.

855
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,930
What's going on?

856
00:40:11,964 --> 00:40:12,930
You okay?

857
00:40:12,964 --> 00:40:14,797
I'm better than okay.

858
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,964
I'm good.

859
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:19,863
I'm great.

860
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:22,897
And I'm so happy I'm not
going through this alone.

861
00:40:25,697 --> 00:40:29,196
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

862
00:40:31,363 --> 00:40:34,229
That's okay, pal.

863
00:40:34,263 --> 00:40:57,263
welcome to www.1000fr.com
