1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,970
They say 40 is t new 3

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,560
And I say they're right.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,550
I look young,I feel young,
and I act young, and frankly,

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,600
most men my age can't begin to keep up.

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,060
So where does a girl go?

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,760
Where does she go to
find suitable playmates?

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,900
Come on. I'm gonna show you.

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,790
Amy and I were suppose||to get
married right after graduation.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,940
She'd already picked out
the dress,reserved the hall.

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,100
Everybody says that it
must have been her time...

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,360
but maybe it was the
drunk who hit her's time.

12
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,170
It's been five months.

13
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,260
I still can't sleep.

14
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,840
Don't really eat.

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,260
Don't really want to be with anybody.

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,240
Other than this group, I mean.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,050
Five months without anybody?

18
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,120
This is actually too simple.

19
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,640
I hope that answers your question.

20
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,240
Completely.

21
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,150
Fold-down rear seats--
I'm gonna get some.

22
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,530
I think I forgot how
amazing that can be.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,660
You want to do it again?

24
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,130
Now,this is the tough part.

25
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,000
Remember,the goal here is to love 'em
and leave 'em, not keep loving 'em.

26
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,330
I mean,how you going to move on
to your next young lover if...

27
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,470
you're still with the last?

28
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,820
So now that you got him where you want
him, the trick is to move in for the kill.

29
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,410
See,that's what really separates
the cougars from the pussycats.

30
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,000
You want to do it again?

31
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,910
- How about that?
- That's nice.

32
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,940
- Like this?
- Oh,yeah.

33
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,970
- Like this?
- That feels good.

34
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,790
- You like that?
- Yeah,that's good.

35
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,140
That's nice. Yeah,that's good.

36
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,790
Bad dream?

37
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,630
It was weird.

38
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,310
Just weird dream. Weird.

39
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,500
This woman, she was behaving like...

40
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,660
well,I don't know what
she was behaving like.

41
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,840
She kept trying to get
these young guys into bed,

42
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,800
and then when she was
through with them...

43
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,740
Actually,she was
behaving just like a man.

44
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,430
Okay. Sorry I asked.

48
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,250
Girls,let's go. Breakfast time.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,030
Ariel?

50
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,950
Don't do that. You do that too hard and
it'll go right through to your brain.

51
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,350
My ear's itchy.

52
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,690
I need your credit card for gas.

53
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,440
I've got a meeting with
Devalos this morning.

54
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,970
Police have not yet released
the name of the young man,

55
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,650
whose body was found early this
morning in the back of his SUV,

56
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,950
- which was in a downtown church parking lot.
- I'll be right back.I got to make a call.

57
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,680
Coroner's figuring he died
last night around 11:00.

58
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,800
You were right about his fiancÈe.

59
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,270
She was killed by a drunk
driver six months ago.

60
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,000
In fact,he was attending some kind of a
grief support meeting here at the church.

61
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:47,140
Well,did anyone see him leave with the woman
I described: tall, very beautiful,early 40s?

62
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,480
According to the others at the meeting,
no one there really fits that description.

63
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,090
I saw her as plain as day.

64
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,750
That's the thing,Allison.

65
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,850
Whoever did this,there's
nothing womanly about her.

66
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,010
It's pretty savage, kind
of bordering on butchery,

67
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,370
and it's hard to imagine a
woman of any age with the anger,

68
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:07,650
not to mention the strength, necessary
to hack this fellow up the way he was.

69
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,520
Come in.

70
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,500
Oh,sorry I'm late.

71
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,750
Hey,come on in,Allison.

72
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,720
You remember Ben, my campaign manager?

73
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,270
Ben Salzberg. Allison Dubois.

74
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,440
- We've met.
- I remember.

75
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,420
"Manuel Devalos. An
Instinct for Justice."

76
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,660
Well,you have my vote, Mr. Devalos.

77
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,830
There's one. Okay Here,I
want to show you something.

78
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,780
Mr. District Attorney, polls show Manuel Devalos is closing the gap on yourseven
- point lead.

79
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,640
Do you have any comment about what's
being called the "Manuel Momentum"?

80
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,350
The only person calling it the "Manuel
Momentum" is former District Attorney Devalos.

81
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,710
Now,I'll admit his numbers look impressive,
given his late entrance into the race,

82
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,240
but the citizens of Phoenix have
had enough of Manuel Devalos.

83
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,870
They know what baggage
he brings with him.

84
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,730
They know that when it comes to the
trying of fact in a court of law,

85
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,190
you don't go to a witch doctor or
a fortune-teller for legal counsel.

86
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,200
My intuition says the
voters aren't buying it.

87
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,900
Thank you very much. Excuse me.

88
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,740
Talk about "going negative."

89
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,970
I didn't bring you here to upset you.

90
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,700
Well,I appreciate that,sir.

91
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,360
Mutual admiration aside,we've
called you here,Mrs. Dubois,

92
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,970
because Manny has a very
important fund-raiser tomorrow.

93
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,300
Say no more.

94
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,870
I'll book a bus ticket
out of town if it'll help.

95
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,960
I thought you said she was a psychic.

96
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,290
You're misunderstanding, Allison.

97
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,870
I don't want you to stay away.

98
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,530
I want you there. Prominently.

99
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,180
I don't understand.

100
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:47,660
Manny's biggest problem and Van Dyke's
biggest asset is "the Allison question."

101
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,500
Who is Allison Dubois? Where is she?

102
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,050
If she's the real deal,
why is Manny hiding her?

103
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:59,280
We've come to the conclusion that the best answer
for the Allison question is Allison herself.

104
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,470
It's time for you to come
out of hiding,Mrs. Dubois.

105
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,810
"The answer to the Allison
question is Allison herself"?

106
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,420
He actually said that?

107
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,070
So what? So now we got
to go to this thing?

108
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,280
Well,what was I supposed to say?

109
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,840
I don't know. Tell
him we got a sick kid.

110
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,310
What?

111
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,620
What are kids for if not to be used as excuses
to get out of things that you don't want to do?

112
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,690
That's not funny.

113
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,800
That's not even a little funny.

114
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,320
If one of our girls gets sick now...

115
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,970
Oh,please,one of our kids
is not going to get sick now.

116
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,410
And it is too funny.

117
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,120
Be quiet. I'm not listening.I'm asleep.

118
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,160
No,you're laughing. You're
laughing on the inside.

119
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,840
I can't hear you. I'm in dreamland.

120
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,880
You want to keep your laughter
down,please? I'm trying to sleep.

121
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,010
You going to want something
else? It's last call.

122
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,000
No,thanks.

123
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,910
I guess I've been stood up.

124
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,240
Happens to the best of us.

125
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,810
You know,he may still show.

126
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,500
You got 20 minutes till closing.

127
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,220
There's no one coming here to meet me.

128
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:11,100
Fundamental truth: Hardworking young men
like the idea of seducing rich,older women.

129
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,960
They think it's easy.

130
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:18,250
They think we're desperate-- so desperate
we'll do whatever it takes to keep them happy.

131
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,480
Little does he know I only
want him for the night.

132
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,680
Glass ring,fake pearls.

133
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,020
He's a man.

134
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,850
He won't know the difference.

135
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,670
How's that treating you?

136
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,900
Good. Thanks.

137
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,620
It's my fault,you know, that he
thinks he can treat me this way.

138
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:45,220
I should never have bought him
that little sports car he wanted.

139
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,270
Now he thinks he can just leave me here sitting,
waiting for him all night in a restaurant.

140
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,030
He sounds like a fool.

141
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,150
A blind fool.

142
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,960
You're right. He is.

143
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,600
Look,I got to ask you something.

144
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,750
Well,go ahead. Hurry up.

145
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,220
Only got 19 minutes before closing.

146
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,230
How does a guy get to be
with a woman like you anyway?

147
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,390
He asks.

148
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,360
You're pretty amazing.

149
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,670
Pretty and amazing, yeah.

150
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,310
God did okay by you,too.

151
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,900
Hey,I'm gonna,uh, pour myself
a drink. You want something?

152
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,420
Whatever you're having,sure.

153
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,690
This one actually makes me a little sad.

154
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,330
He's so cute.

155
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,080
I could see myself spending more
than just one night with him.

156
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,180
But that would never work.

157
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,860
He thinks I actually have money.

158
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,260
Don't look so surprised.

159
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,850
Any cougar worth her salt knows
a thing or two about nails.

160
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:33,160
Hey,lover, you ever had your back
scratched by a woman who really knows how?

161
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,130
Oh,come on. Don't be such a baby.

162
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,580
You'll love it.

163
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,630
Careful.She just fell asleep.
I don't want to wake her.

164
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,050
Okay. Don't blame me.

165
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,130
Blame Dr. Friedman.

166
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,340
He's the one who's leaving town and told us
we've got to get to his office in half an hour.

167
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,120
Hey,how many times you
think we've made this trip?

168
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,430
I don't know,what?

169
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,190
The early morning ear
infection/antibiotic run? I don't know.

170
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,220
Together or separate...

171
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,430
Hey,what street was that?

172
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,500
24th,I think.

173
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,750
Let me use your phone. I've
got to call Detective Scanlon.

174
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,150
Detective Lee Scanlon, Phoenix PD.

175
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,640
I,uh,I got an anonymous tip|| there might have
been some trouble here in the restaurant last night.

176
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,180
Well,looks okay to me.

177
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,400
Okay,I give up.

178
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,780
Come on,Allison.

179
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,770
Hello? Lee,is that you?Hello?

180
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,930
Uh,I'm gonna... I'm
gonna call you back,okay?

181
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,370
What's going on?

182
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,700
**********

183
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,900
Victim's name is Ryan
Haas, 26 years old.

184
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,220
Been working at this restaurant
for four years as a bartender.

185
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:21,210
The manager said,uh, Ryan offered to
close up last night after his shift ended.

186
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,680
Didn't say anything about
him,uh,having a date.

187
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,620
Anyone remember the woman at the bar?

188
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,950
This place is kind of a pickup joint.

189
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,630
Ryan was a flirt.

190
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,170
The manager says there's always girls hanging
around the bar till closing, but no one they noticed.

191
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,380
Well,that doesn't make sense.
This woman is beautiful.

192
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,780
She was,uh... sexy.

193
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,200
She's not the kind of woman
who would go unnoticed.

194
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,570
Well,she did last night,
if she even exists.

195
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,070
What does that mean?

196
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,720
Allison,this guy was
killed with a nail gun.

197
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,400
So?

198
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,490
So how many women you
know have a nail gun?

199
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,210
Much less the strength to overpower
a 26-year-old man long enough

200
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,410
to drive a couple hundred six-penny
nails into his head, his neck,his chest...

201
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,110
This isn't about strength.

202
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,720
It's just like that guy that got
lured into the back of his van

203
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,700
and stabbed to death the other night.

204
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,120
She seduces them, she has sex with them,

205
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,050
and then when their defenses are down
and they're vulnerable, then she strikes.

206
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,280
I want to see that movie.

207
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,580
You know,I'm not even convinced
these two murders are related.

208
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,650
Well,they are.

209
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,820
So you're telling me that there's
a female serial killer out there,

210
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,270
picking up men and then murdering them.

211
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,730
That's what I'm saying.

212
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,250
I guess I should be grateful I'm
not out there on the prowl anymore.

213
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,280
Relax,stud. You're about ten
years too old for this black widow.

214
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,870
You look pretty.

215
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,140
Thanks,sugar. So do you.

216
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,090
Mama has to go out.

217
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,950
I don't want to, but I promised
someone I'd do something for them.

218
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,500
How do you feel?

219
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,320
It still hurts.

220
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,670
You know Daddy and Ariel and Bridgette are
all going to be here to take care of you,

221
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,180
and I'll be back home
before you know it,okay?

222
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,020
"I" before "E," except after "C."

223
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,040
Can't you just tell me how to spell it?

224
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,810
Uh,Dad,I think you're in trouble, 'cause
Mom's all dressed up and you're not.

225
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,450
No,honey. Daddy's staying home with you.

226
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,550
It's okay. You can take him if you want.

227
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,320
He's being kind of grouchy anyways.

228
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:34,410
You know,the whole point of "the kid is
sick" excuse is to get us both out of going.

229
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,700
Yeah,I'll remember that next time.

230
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,980
Hey,don't forget to wake her up at
9:30 for her last dose of medicine,okay?

231
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,010
Come on,grouchy.

232
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,360
Allison.

233
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,920
It's so great you're here.

234
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,170
Don't be silly. What a terrific turnout.

235
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,730
It's going very well, lots
of press,lots of donors,

236
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,050
a few big fish we still need to haul
into the boa|| And here comes Shamu now.

237
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,510
How are you?

238
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,530
Constance,I'm so pleased
you could make it.

239
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,870
Mr. District Attorney.

240
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,230
I don't see Richard.

241
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,370
Oh,he's running late.
Some business thing.

242
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,860
Constance,have you met Mrs. Dubois?

243
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,080
Allison Dubois,this is Constance Madsen.

244
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,100
Nice to meet you.

245
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,550
Oh,my... the famous Allison Dubois.

246
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,710
So tell me,what is my
fortune? What's in my future?

247
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,640
Oh,I feel strongly you and your husband are going to
make a significant contribution to Mr. Devalos' campaign.

248
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,680
Very clever,Mrs. Dubois.

249
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:36,250
Allison, Constance's husband, Richard,owns a
very successful construction firm here in Phoenix,

250
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,270
and they have been very
supportive over the years.

251
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,880
But then,I'm sure you knew that.

252
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,150
Oh,yes. I know everything.

253
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,580
Well,tell me, do you happen to know when
my husband is actually going to show up?

254
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:58,170
But the truth is, I did
not do it all myself.

255
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,410
I was privileged to work with a
dedicated group of police detectives,

256
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,020
and some of the most
talented ADAs in the country.

257
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,920
And as most of you now
know, I had a secret weapon.

258
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,670
Her name is Allison Dubois.

259
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:20,130
Allison worked for me as an investigator,
as a jury consultant and as a paralegal.

260
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,990
And it was her dedicated
service to the city of Phoenix

261
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,610
that was invaluable in helping to convict
and incarcerate a number of violent criminals.

262
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,070
So what does your crystal ball say?

263
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,690
Is he going to win this election?

264
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,030
I wish I knew.

265
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,700
I'm afraid I'm as much in the
dark as anybody on this subject.

266
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,890
Really? That doesn't seem fair.

267
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,530
I think it's the universe's
way of evening the score.

268
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,000
Connie!

269
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,430
There you are.

270
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,350
Sorry I'm late. What did I miss?

271
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,570
The speeches,the food, the champagne...

272
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,570
but let me introduce you to the
very best part of the evening.

273
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,730
Richard,this is Allison Dubois.

274
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,060
She's the psychic who was working
with Manuel all those years.

275
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,170
A-ha,how do you do?

276
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,050
Is this honestly the only way?

277
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,610
It's the only way for you.

278
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,850
You don't look happy,Richard.
You should be happy.

279
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,330
I know I'm happy.

280
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,580
Now,go.

281
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,210
Go to your little party for
Manuel Devalos and enjoy yourself.

282
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,060
And please write him a generous check.

283
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:35,260
She looked into the future and said that you
are going to write a big check for this campaign.

284
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:39,610
Well... we don't want to
make a liar out her,now do we?

285
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,810
Hey,stranger.

286
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,880
What time did you get in?

287
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,810
A little before midnight.

288
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,750
You two were dead to the world.

289
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,420
Yeah,well,this little one
was exhausted from screaming.

290
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,590
And me,I was exhausted from
trying to calm her down.

291
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,900
Poor thing.

292
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,080
Oh,I'm okay.

293
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,640
So what did I miss?

294
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,410
How was the fundraiser?

295
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,110
Did we raise a lot of funds?

296
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,000
Did we fund a lot of raises?

297
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,060
It was fine.

298
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,500
Well,actually, it was a little strange.

299
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,780
I was introduced to this friend
of Devalos',this big donor.

300
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,010
And the second I met him...

301
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,470
I knew something was wrong.

302
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,040
What do you mean "wrong"? Was he ill?

303
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,650
Something going to happen to him?

304
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,100
Not him,Devalos.

305
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,100
Something bad was going
to happen to Devalos.

306
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,910
What do you mean "bad"?

307
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,470
I don't know.

308
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,430
His friend was in cahoots with Van Dyke.

309
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,560
They were plotting against Devalos.

310
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,900
What do you mean?
Plotting against him how?

311
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,060
I don't know.

312
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,690
So you met this guy, and you
got a bad feeling about him.

313
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,190
Then what happened?

314
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,980
Well,then he wrote Devalos a big check.

315
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:07,860
Well,I'm no politico, but there must be a better
way to crush a campaign than by funding it.

316
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,250
So did you say something to him?

317
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,690
Well,say wh||?

318
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,570
The night seemed to be
going so well for him.

319
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,170
I didn't want to be the one to ruin it.

320
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,650
Especially since I don't know
what, if anything,is going on.

321
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:33,760
All right,we have 45 minutes
before the girls get up.

322
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,570
Oh,did you happen to see the note that
I left for you in the kitchen last night?

323
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,460
The message from Scanlon?

324
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,300
You know,I don't get it. I'm usually
persona non grata around here.

325
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,150
You know,you're sneaking
around to meet me, but today,

326
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,180
you're waiting for me by the front
door, escorting me up the elevator.

327
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:52,820
What can I tell you?

328
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,620
If I had my way,we'd pick you up in a limo,
offer you champagne and caviar for lunch.

329
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,440
You know,don't you worry if you lie
like that, your nose is going to grow?

330
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,320
Or God's going to
smite you or something?

331
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,660
Look,the honest to God truth is,

332
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:06,140
I got two dead 20-something guys who were
found exactly where you said they'd be,

333
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,650
murdered exactly the
way you said they'd be.

334
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,530
I need to get you with a sketch artist.

335
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,070
I know it sounds like a lot of nothing.

336
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,350
I just kind of felt funny
keeping it to myself.

337
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,460
Well,I don't know what
to tell you,Allison.

338
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,830
The man's check cleared.

339
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,060
Well,at the end of the day, I guess
that's all that really matters.

340
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,280
I'm being summoned.

341
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,590
Oh,well,then don't let me keep you.

342
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,930
You know,it meant a lot to me
that you were there last night,

343
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,920
and for what it's worth, your name
was mentioned in this morning's paper.

344
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,960
Well,then I guess it's
mission accomplished.

345
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,070
Mission accomplished.

346
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,910
I'll talk to you soon.

347
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,780
You know,it just doesn't make much
sense what she's saying, Mr. Devalos.

348
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,850
It just... doesn't.

349
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,530
Well,I grant you,it doesn't
make much sense to us.

350
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,730
No,it doesn't make much sense,period.

351
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,580
Why would Richard Madsen be having secret
meetings with District Attorney Van Dyke?

352
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,950
The man just donated a
truckload of money to you.

353
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,970
Well,then, you tell me.

354
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,870
What kind of deal could
they have been making?

355
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
Manny,listen to yourself.

356
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,860
You're becoming completely preoccupied
because some woman told you ...

357
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,440
Not some woman.

358
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,370
Allison Dubois. Do me a favor.

359
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,300
Just... keep your ear to the ground.

360
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,390
Okay.

361
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,740
Got your message.

362
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,170
Dispatch said you think you
may have spotted my suspect.

363
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,310
My partner and I got a call to
break up a fight in the parking lot.

364
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,460
We were finishing up in here with the owner,
and I saw someone that looked like your sketch.

365
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,930
She even has the coat.

366
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,750
Hello.

367
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,460
Sorry.

368
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,740
- Hello?
- Am I waking you?

369
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,200
No. It's okay.

370
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,430
I think I may have spotted your exterminating
angel, that woman you keep dreaming about?

371
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,190
She's here at a bar trolling
for guys half her age.

372
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,350
You're kidding.

373
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,410
No,Allison. It's 11:45.

374
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,830
I never kid after 10:00 on a weeknight.

375
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,960
So here's what I'm calling to find out.

376
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:30,950
You had any more dreams?

377
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,400
I mean,is this chick gonna pull a chainsaw out
of her purse or a jackhammer out of her underwear?

378
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,410
Is there anything I should
be on the lookout for?

379
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,340
I'm sorry. I don't know.

380
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,770
I haven't had a dreamt about
her in the last couple days.

381
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,180
Okay,well,I'm gonna take that as a good sign,
maybe introduce myself to this little lady,

382
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,250
see if I can get to the
bottom of this thing.

383
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,470
Okay.

384
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,400
- All right.
- Bye.

385
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:01,440
I no,uh, speaka da English
so... so good,yeah,no.

386
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,200
You speaka da English just fine.

387
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,180
Oh,pretty. Oh,yeah.Yeah.

388
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:12,580
Maybe,um, I-I teach
you Italiano later,huh?

389
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,170
Excuse me? Excuse me!Phoenix PD.

390
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,390
Ma'am,if I could ask you to please
step away from the gentleman.

391
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,690
Keep your hands where I can see them.

392
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,180
What's this all abou|| What's going on?

393
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,600
It's about her,sir. It's not about you.

394
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,290
If you could stand still and stay calm.

395
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,310
I am not from here. Are you policia?

396
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,370
Yeah. That's me.Policia.

397
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,250
Tell you what. Why don't
you hand me the purse?

398
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,610
Hand me the purse. Turn around.

399
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,110
Put your hands on the car. Turn around.

400
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,780
Put your hands on the car.

401
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,810
Uh,scuzi? Scuzi?

402
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:47,040
Says here,you're
Michelle Todd of Tucson.

403
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,300
Okay.

404
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:52,470
So,uh,is trying to impress a guy
in a bar against the law,Officer?

405
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,170
Maybe.

406
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,400
I think you're going to have
to come with me,Ms. Todd.

407
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,250
What? I'm just a girl
looking to have some fun.

408
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,790
- What's the crime?
- Murder.

409
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,130
Well,wait a second.

410
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,010
- What are you talking about?
- You ever had any contact with a Ryan Haas or Mr. Sean Covey?

411
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,980
Who?

412
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,260
Maybe you never asked them their names.

413
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,240
A support group widower in
need of a little comfort?

414
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,380
A bartender I suspect
you may have nailed?

415
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,660
- You have the right to remain silent...
- Wait.

416
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,840
Wait,wait. Wait a second.Wait a second!

417
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,180
A bartender? Support group widowers?

418
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,100
It sounds like you're talking
about my book. I have a...

419
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,810
Ma'am,let's not make
this difficult,okay?

420
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,710
No,no,look,look! Open my trunk.

421
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,760
It sounds like my book!

422
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,910
Open my trunk, and I'll show you!

423
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,460
All right,all right,all right.

424
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,990
If you take her for a second?

425
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,920
A Cougar's Guide to the Hunt: Bagging a
Man in the Urban Jungle by Charisma Kennedy.

426
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,760
Be nice. That's my pen name.

427
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,700
Look,flip it over.
Look,see?That's my picture.

428
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,500
It's beautiful.

429
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,050
Thank you.

430
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,010
See,in there...in there... Under
the chapter headings-- look,see?

431
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,930
It's all there.

432
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,520
"Making the Connection
at a Support Group."

433
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,150
"Leaving More than a
Tip for the Bartender."

434
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,400
Nothing in here about cops,huh?

435
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,900
No. Why?

436
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,240
Tonight's your lucky night.

437
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,940
I'm going to take you downtown.

438
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,840
I hate you. It's barely
7:00 in the morning.

439
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,730
Hey,early bird,I thought you
wanted to catch this worm.

440
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,500
Well,where is she? I've
been here since 6:00.

441
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,450
Hold your horses. The
show is about to begin.

442
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,420
Here comes your dream girl now.

443
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,200
What do you think?

444
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,440
Well,that's her.

445
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,730
At least it looks like her.

446
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,370
What's the hesitation about?

447
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,300
I don't know. She looks so frightened.

448
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,410
Well,being charged with
murder will do that to you.

449
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,990
Hey,when you get a chance, if you have some
time, this is actually a pretty good read.

450
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,350
Every seduction you ever
dreamed of is in here.

451
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,690
The support group, the bartender.

452
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,680
It's quite uncanny.

453
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,680
What is this, a how-to
book for killing men?

454
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,350
Not killing them,
Allison. Seducing them.

455
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,980
Oh,you mean, there's no chapter in here
about the best way to nail-gun your man

456
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,210
after he's flambÈed you in the kitchen?

457
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,900
Maybe she's saving that for the sequel.

458
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,540
Let's go have a little chat.

459
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,180
You both understand how absurd this is.

460
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,960
I... Look at me!I-I...

461
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,250
I don't even know how to
use a knife or a nail gun.

462
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,710
I like men. In fact,I love them.

463
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,120
I've made a lot of money loving them.

464
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,290
How do you mean?

465
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,350
Well, as Charisma
Kennedy, I have the books.

466
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,400
I've written 12.

467
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,540
That one came out four months ago.

468
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,380
In fact,I'm still
doing the book signings.

469
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,570
Then there's Charisma
Kennedy, the column and blog.

470
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,630
Then as Michelle,I have The Single
Girl's Guide to Financial Independence.

471
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,860
And then as John Todd,I have The Single
Guy's Guide to Financial Independence.

472
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:01,760
I'm a busy little girl,
but I am no murderer.

473
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,710
Then why don't you just tell us where
you were on the nights in question?

474
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,080
Look,I don't mind
waiting for a couple hours

475
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,320
until your lawyer gets into his
office and we can get him down here.

476
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,350
No,really.

477
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,970
I don't have anything to hide. I...

478
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,530
It's just you're not
going to believe my alibi.

479
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,080
What do you mean?

480
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,420
Do you not remember what you were
doing on the nights in question?

481
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:25,050
I remember exactly what I was doing.

482
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,050
I was at home...

483
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,870
alone... reading.

484
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,820
I don't know.Based on
what I saw last night,

485
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:35,330
you don't strike me as the
"home alone reading" type.

486
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,800
Well,I am.

487
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,390
For the most part.

488
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:44,300
Sure,yeah,sometimes I have to go
out and see what's really going on.

489
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,610
Hear the latest lines.

490
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,310
Try a new technique.

491
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,830
Is there a law against a single
girl looking to have some fun?

492
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,150
You say that,but the fact
remains two men are dead.

493
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,150
Well,I had nothing to do with it!

494
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,910
I'm no killer.

495
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,950
Like I said,I love men!

496
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,970
But the fact remains two men have been murdered
using techniques eerily similar to not one,

497
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,450
but two chapters in your book.

498
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,550
Yeah,well,then, maybe it means
that your killer can read.

499
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,020
Look,I'm going to make this
simple for you,Ms. Todd.

500
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,520
If you can't provide us with an
alibi for the nights in question,

501
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,760
then I'm gonna have to exercise
my right to hold you for 24 hours

502
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,170
while I obtain a warrant
to search your apartment.

503
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,470
But that's not right!

504
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:29,600
Yeah,well... that's the law.

505
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,530
But don't worry.

506
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,650
I'll be sending a hot,young thing in
here in a minute to,uh,show you to a cell.

507
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,820
Come in.

508
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,310
Richard.

509
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,700
Come on in. Take a seat.

510
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,550
I'll just leave and
let you two catch up.

511
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,140
So,you want to tell me about it?

512
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:03,180
What... What are you
talking about,Manny?

513
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:08,210
I got a message to come
see you, and here I am.

514
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,860
It's your meeting. You want
an answer?Ask a question.

515
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,130
Okay,here's a question.

516
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,990
Did you know when I
was District Attorney,

517
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,720
that some concerns surfaced about
corruption in the construction sector?

518
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,900
No. I...I didn't know that.

519
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:29,750
Didn't get very far before I was
asked to take a permanent vacation.

520
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,310
But as it turns out, I still have some
friends in the District Attorney's office,

521
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,430
and recently, they've brought
some information to my attention.

522
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,860
Paying off city inspectors?

523
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,390
Bribing council members?

524
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,310
Van Dyke must have really
put the screws to you.

525
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,210
I don't know what you're talking about,

526
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:54,530
but this is a strange way to thank
a major contributor to your campaign.

527
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,080
Yeah. Right.

528
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,430
Thanks. So,how is that supposed to work?

529
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,770
I cash the check, and then Van Dyke
announces that he's indicting you?

530
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,220
And,oh,yes, isn't it funny that former
DA Manuel Devalos is taking money

531
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:14,200
from a city contractor under
investigation for corruption and fraud?

532
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,670
What did he promise you?

533
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,900
A suspended sentence, some kind of fine?

534
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,280
You're my friend,Manny.

535
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:28,160
Y-You've always been my friend. I...

536
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,380
I had no choice. I,uh...

537
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,380
I can't go to jail.

538
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,150
It was very strange.

539
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,580
On one hand I had these very vivid
dreams, in which she was always the one.

540
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:53,980
And then sitting across from her
today, my instincts told me I was wrong.

541
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,660
Well,for God's sake,
listen to your instincts.

542
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,030
Don't listen to your instincts.

543
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:03,190
Well,she's in jail tonight.

544
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,490
So,I guess it's up to the police
and the justice system now.

545
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,210
Why are you scratching your ear?

546
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,050
I don't know.

547
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,720
I'm hoping it's just a case
of the power of suggestion.

548
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,650
Hanging out with Marie all this
time, watching her scratch her ear.

549
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,650
Well,I hope you're right.

550
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:26,860
I will be very upset if I have to wake up early
in the morning and rush you to the pediatrician.

551
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,240
Right back at you.

552
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,550
Where you going?

553
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,920
I told you. I have a transport at 0800.

554
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,450
I'm shipping out to Germany for
a satellite operations assignment.

555
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,190
So... last night was it?

556
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,640
You turn me out and then you just leave?

557
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,330
Honey,we agreed.

558
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,740
No strings attached.

559
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,130
No seeing each other again.

560
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,790
Yeah,but that was before.

561
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,880
I mean,this is kind of new to me,but...

562
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,620
I don't want you to go.

563
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,170
I'll tell you what.

564
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,140
I'll give you something
special before I leave.

565
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,980
Something to remember me by.

566
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,870
Come here.

567
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,830
What are you doing?

568
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,610
You'll see. Give me your hand.

569
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,620
There you go.

570
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,760
Now the other.

571
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,800
There you go.

572
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,270
Now close your eyes.

573
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:55,440
Lift your head.

574
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,520
They're bringing her up right now.

575
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,060
How is she?

576
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,410
Relieved. Upset.

577
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,240
Thrilled that she's starting
to look like she's not guilty.

578
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,720
Horrified that somebody's doing this.

579
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,900
I don't know what to tell you,Lee.

580
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,860
In my dreams,I saw her.

581
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,240
I saw her kill that man last night.

582
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,860
I saw her kill all those men.

583
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,110
Well,she definitely didn't kill
the guy you called about last night.

584
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,380
She's been under lock and
key for the past 24 hours.

585
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:34,720
Ms. Todd, I want to tell you that the Phoenix
Police Department extends its sincerest apologies.

586
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,660
So,that's it?

587
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,640
************

588
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:41,640
********

589
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:45,000
*********you are free to go.

590
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:54,090
You know, my book has sold
upwards of 60,000 copies.

591
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,320
Okay.

592
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:59,690
Well,it seems to me that means there are at
least 60,000 people who could be doing this.

593
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,960
Who could be using my book, my...

594
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:06,810
techniques, the scenarios I've
written to lure young men into bed.

595
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,540
Yeah,actually,I thought
about that myself.

596
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:12,270
Except I couldn't find the setup for
last night's killing anywhere in here.

597
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,400
- Really?
- Really.Here.

598
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:17,090
We know that the killer was
dressed up as a naval officer.

599
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,230
And there isn't any, anything
like that in the book.

600
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,920
A naval officer?

601
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:26,420
Oh,they told me they hated that one.

602
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,150
I'm sorry. Who told you they hated what?

603
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,560
My publisher.

604
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,140
It was one of the scenarios
that was cut from my book.

605
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,200
Uh,"Patriot Games" I think I called it.

606
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,770
Female naval officer.It's her
last night before shipping off

607
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:42,070
and she is going to spend it
sharing her bedroom secrets *******

608
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,010
Um,are there any others?

609
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,840
Sure.

610
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,980
I remember they couldn't wait to get
rid of "Naughty Nun with a Bad Habit."

611
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:52,780
It was like,who has a
nun's habit hanging around?

612
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,880
Oh,and then there's "The Extra Ticket."

613
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,000
Simple,but effective.

614
00:35:56,010 --> 00:36:01,870
Very few men can resist the,the temptation of
accepting that extra ticket to "tonight's big game."

615
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,380
Of course,it's after the game
that the fun really begins.

616
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:12,240
And these techniques, these chapters that
were cut, who else might have seen them?

617
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:17,510
Sandra Marshall, my publisher,
and-and-and her staff. Yeah.

618
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,040
*******

619
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,440
Can I have the remote,please?

620
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,100
Thank you.

621
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:35,340
I'm here to speak with you today on behalf
of my client and friend,Richard Madsen.

622
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,950
Many of you know Richard.

623
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,720
- He built our new hospital downtown.
- What the hell is this?

624
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:42,110
He's currently hard at work
on our new arts complex.

625
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,480
His firm is also involved in the
upkeep of our bridges and roadways.

626
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:50,430
Also,Mr. Madsen is a major financial
supporter of my run for District Attorney,

627
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,530
which is why it saddened me earlier today
to learn that for the past several months,

628
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:58,980
Mr. Madsen's firm has been involved in
a series of payoffs to city officials

629
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,740
in order to secure contracts and approvals
his company might not otherwise have enjoyed.

630
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,150
Oh,my God.

631
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,530
My conscience...

632
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,060
it's been weighing on me.

633
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:12,060
So, I decided to talk
to my friend Manuel here,

634
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:15,410
who has advised me to throw
myself on the mercy of the court.

635
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,420
No! No,no,no,no,no!

636
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:20,750
Corruption in city government
is an insidious problem.

637
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:25,800
It cannot happen if it
is not allowed to happen.

638
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,350
Ladies,my name is Detective Lee Scanlon.

639
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,850
I'm sure you're all familiar with the recent series
of killings here in Phoenix targeting young,single men.

640
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:42,350
Well,we have reason to believe that these killings may
have been inspired by a book that you published here,

641
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,850
a book that all of you women worked on.

642
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,240
It's called A Cougar's Guide to the
Hunt: Bagging a Man in the Urban Jungle.

643
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,410
I'm sure you're all
familiar with it. Yeah?

644
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,070
Well,as part of our investigation,uh,

645
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,760
I'm going to need to know where each of you were on
the nights that each of these killings took place.

646
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,520
Then put it right five
times,Bridge, but...

647
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,910
Hello?

648
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,590
Allison. It's Lee.

649
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,480
I'm over here at Michelle's
publishing company.

650
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,100
I gotta tell you, it's
a complete strikeout.

651
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:15,050
Every single one of the women who worked
on this book has a rock-solid alibi.

652
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,880
Allison?

653
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,240
I don't know what to tell
you,Lee. I'm stumped,too.

654
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:22,190
Well,that's two of us.
Except I'm stumped and hungry.

655
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,480
Uh,I'm going to get out of
here.Call me if you need me.

656
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,950
Okay.

657
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,740
You work here?

658
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,230
No. Just visiting.

659
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,720
Are you an author?

660
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:57,080
Elliot Davis. This is my company.

661
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,930
Nice to meet you.

662
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,950
Are you from out of town?

663
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,930
You got that slightly dazed, "I'm
from out of town" look in your eye.

664
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,760
Do I?

665
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,020
You know what?If you're free,

666
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,830
I've got a couple of tickets
to the big game tonight.

667
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,280
I was supposed to go with a buddy
of mine, but he just cancelled.

668
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:20,080
We could grab some dinner.
Catch the game.Whatever.

669
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,860
Where should I pick you up?

670
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,370
What? You've never been
approached by a man before?

671
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,590
At my age,I don't get
approached much by anybody.

672
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,440
No,I don't believe that.

673
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,230
I mean,who doesn't appreciate
the company of young people?

674
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,880
But every now and then, it's nice to spend some
time with somebody who can carry on a conversation.

675
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:47,430
Ah,you'd be amazed at the number of
people, who otherwise would never...

676
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,850
yeah,they're at a vulnerable moment.

677
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,040
They're lonely. They're bored.

678
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,760
In a strange city.

679
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:00,300
It's just a basketball game.

680
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,860
I've been told I'm terrific company.

681
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,440
I promise you, I'm discreet.

682
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:14,880
In fact,I think I can safely say that no one who's
ever spent time with me has ever lived to regret it.

683
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:22,620
City detectives announced this
afternoon that publisher Elliot Davis

684
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,970
has been arrested and charged
with three counts of murder.

685
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:31,350
The 49-year-old Davis reportedly confessed
to luring three local men to their deaths,

686
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:37,480
using a book his company published that
advises older women how to seduce young men.

687
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:40,300
Michelle Todd,who goes by
the name Charisma Kennedy,

688
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,940
the author of A Cougar's
Guide to the Hunt,

689
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:47,090
was shocked to learn how her book
played a role in the murder spree...

690
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,190
Okay,quit moving.

691
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,620
I can't get this medicine in your ear.

692
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,740
Naturally,I'm shocked and
saddened that a book that

693
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,090
I wrote with the intention
of bringing pleasure

694
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,640
and-and hope to women of a certain age
would be used in such a perverse way.

695
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:04,130
I mean,it's obviously
a very effective book...

696
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,680
maybe too effective.

697
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,390
And what's next for you?

698
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,360
Well,ironically,this tragedy has brought
a lot of attention to the Cougar books.

699
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:18,490
I've gotten a number of calls from cable
networks about a Cougar reality show,

700
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:23,590
and maybe a Cougar Web site or a social
networking,uh,page like My Cougar.

701
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,040
And you know... I'm open to anything.

702
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,950
What is she saying? I can't hear.

703
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,510
I can't hear anything with all
this, this medicine in my ear.

704
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,300
Don't worry. You didn't miss a thing.
