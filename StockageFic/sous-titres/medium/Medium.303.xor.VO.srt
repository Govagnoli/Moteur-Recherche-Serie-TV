00:00:02,113 --> 00:00:05,361
???????

2
00:00:05,897 --> 00:00:09,437
<i>a series of questions we answer
through the choices we make.</i>

3
00:00:13,577 --> 00:00:15,727
<i>Sometimes they work against us.</i>

4
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,246
<i>Most of the times, it isn't the
choice itself that's stressful,</i>

5
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,493
<i>but rather the consequence
of the choice,</i>

6
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,477
<i>a result we couldn't foresee...</i>

7
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:44,348
<i>or didn't quite imagine.</i>

8
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,706
<i>But what if
when we made our choices...</i>

9
00:01:03,912 --> 00:01:06,392
<i>...having realized
we made the wrong ones,</i>

10
00:01:07,088 --> 00:01:08,919
<i>there was some way to go back,</i>

11
00:01:09,254 --> 00:01:11,992
<i>some way to invoke
a kind of big do-over.</i>

12
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:13,855
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

13
00:01:16,486 --> 00:01:18,182
<i>Wouldn't that be great?</i>

14
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,818
<i>Wouldn't that just be the best?</i>

15
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:32,367
You okay?

16
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:34,488
Everything all right?

17
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:35,403
Mm-hmm.

18
00:01:36,383 --> 00:01:38,590
I'm fine; I just had a dream.

19
00:01:46,685 --> 00:01:47,901
What are you doing?

20
00:01:48,956 --> 00:01:50,469
You know what
I'm doing.

21
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:55,259
Well, I don't feel like
doing that right now.

22
00:01:55,372 --> 00:01:57,674
That's okay, I'll
do all the work.

23
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:03,615
(chuckling):
That...

24
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:05,369
that is not the
look of love.

25
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,849
What's your problem?

26
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:09,033
What are you
talking about?

27
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,481
I don't have a
problem, I just...

28
00:02:11,536 --> 00:02:13,073
I just figured
that you're up

29
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:14,649
and I'm up...

30
00:02:14,752 --> 00:02:15,809
I know.

31
00:02:16,017 --> 00:02:17,231
It's been a while.

32
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,855
Well, I'm not going
to forget how to do it.

33
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,352
It's just I'm tired,
honey, I'm cranky.

34
00:02:22,494 --> 00:02:23,439
Yeah...

35
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:26,079
Tomorrow,
I promise tomorrow.

36
00:02:26,662 --> 00:02:29,031
Yeah, you say that, but
it's a vicious cycle.

37
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:31,863
Let me explain
something to you.

38
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:34,486
Sex isn't just sex.

39
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,642
Sex is good for you,

40
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:39,599
'cause sex releases
endorphins.

41
00:02:40,571 --> 00:02:42,564
And endorphins
make you happy.

42
00:02:42,668 --> 00:02:43,658
Mmm.

43
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,739
Yes. I know that, I do.

44
00:02:45,852 --> 00:02:49,507
And I fully plan on
being happy tomorrow,

45
00:02:50,026 --> 00:02:51,683
whether I feel like it
or not.

46
00:02:52,192 --> 00:03:02,395

47
00:03:02,477 --> 00:03:12,217
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@FadeOut
Sync:FRM@Navel</font>

48
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,017
Girls, breakfast is ready!

49
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,159
Where is your sister?

50
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:46,008
Ariel says she's not going
to school today.

51
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:47,135
Why not?

52
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,673
I don't know; ask her.

53
00:03:49,807 --> 00:03:51,591
Ariel? I need to speak with you!

54
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,127
I'm here, I'm
here, I'm here...

55
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:54,934
but I'm not going
to school today.

56
00:03:55,198 --> 00:03:56,039
Oh, really?

57
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,701
You can't make me go.

58
00:03:57,887 --> 00:03:59,014
Oh, yeah, I can;
I'm your mother.

59
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,191
They gave me permission
at the hospital when I had you.

60
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:02,556
Mom, I have to stay home,

61
00:04:02,662 --> 00:04:04,365
or Amy Amson
is going to beat me up.

62
00:04:04,517 --> 00:04:06,093
Wait a second-- who's Amy Amson?

63
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:08,052
She's this girl
in my biology class.

64
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,848
Somebody passed her
this note by mistake,

65
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:11,548
and I guess the boys wrote it.

66
00:04:11,748 --> 00:04:13,764
Um, it's a list of who's hot
and who's not,

67
00:04:13,846 --> 00:04:15,276
and according to them, I'm hot,

68
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:16,892
and according to them,
she's not.

69
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:21,153
So Hannah says she says that
she's going to mess my face up

70
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,429
today before Biology,
so I'm not hot anymore.

71
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,226
<i>Somebody thinks you're hot?</i>

72
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,384
I thought you had to be smart
to get into eighth grade.

73
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:30,793
And you actually think
this is going to happen?

74
00:04:31,657 --> 00:04:33,793
If you stay home today,
what do you do tomorrow?

75
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:35,393
(chuckling):
Tomorrow's Saturday.

76
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:36,990
No, you know what
I'm talking about.

77
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:38,584
You know what this is?

78
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,827
This is a vicious cycle,
that's what it is.

79
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:42,104
And you know what
we have to do?

80
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:43,346
You have to go to school.

81
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:45,686
You have to show this girl

82
00:04:45,727 --> 00:04:47,342
that you are not
going to be intimidated,

83
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:50,462
and I can almost guarantee you,
nothing is going to happen.

84
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:52,592
Did I hear someone mention
a vicious cycle?

85
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:54,749
There's a lot of that
going around lately.

86
00:04:54,853 --> 00:04:56,723
Daddy, please,
I have to stay home.

87
00:04:57,388 --> 00:04:59,644
This is really a matter
of life and death.

88
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:02,748
(sighs)
Sounds like it's going
to be a rough morning.

89
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:05,099
Bet you wish you
had some endorphins
right about now.

90
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:09,046
I'm sorry, Ariel, staying home
is not the answer.

91
00:05:09,162 --> 00:05:11,203
I've got an important
arraignment at work today,

92
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,635
and you can't stay here
by yourself.

93
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:15,322
BRIDGETTE:
What's an arraignment?

94
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:17,082
Okay, fine, but
you are responsible

95
00:05:17,122 --> 00:05:18,289
for whatever
happens to me.

96
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:19,833
If I die...
You're not
going to die.

97
00:05:19,888 --> 00:05:20,993
Nothing's going to happen.

98
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,240
What's an arraignment?

99
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,223
We'll see.

100
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:25,560
We'll see.

101
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:28,767
Will somebody please tell me
what an arraignment is?!

102
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,823
I believe our middle child
has a question for you.

103
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:34,022
An arraignment.
An arraignment is what happens

104
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,838
when someone is being accused
of a crime.

105
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,671
Before there's a trial
or anything,

106
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:38,773
they go down to court...

107
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:40,030
(phone rings)
and the court tells them

108
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:43,138
what they're being accused of,
and they tell the court

109
00:05:43,235 --> 00:05:44,959
if they believe they're innocent
or guilty.
JOE:
Hello?

110
00:05:45,295 --> 00:05:47,822
But why would anybody
say they're guilty?
Who's calling?

111
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,711
Well, that's a very
good question.

112
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:51,359
They want to speak
to a Mrs. Dubois.

113
00:05:51,423 --> 00:05:53,277
They won't take "no"
for an answer...

114
00:05:53,637 --> 00:05:54,508
Hello?

115
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:55,628
No.

116
00:05:55,724 --> 00:05:58,485
I'm not interested in having
my carpets and drapes cleaned.

117
00:05:58,844 --> 00:05:59,636
No.

118
00:05:59,749 --> 00:06:02,156
I don't want a free
in-home estimate.

119
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:04,467
No, you don't have to call back
in three months

120
00:06:04,556 --> 00:06:06,571
for a follow-up.
Thank you.
Oops.

121
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,100
Oh, great.

122
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:11,795
This is turning out to be
a wonderful day.

123
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,323
Don't blame me.

124
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:15,390
I offered, you passed.

125
00:06:17,405 --> 00:06:18,325
Sorry to bother you.

126
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:19,812
I was going over
these crime scene photos

127
00:06:19,882 --> 00:06:20,893
from the Krieger case.

128
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,460
I think I may
have found something.

129
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:23,679
Why are you showing me this?

130
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:26,044
Well, just... I think Krieger
may have had some help.

131
00:06:26,131 --> 00:06:27,851
I don't think he killed
these people by himself.

132
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,161
Well, that's all well
and good, Allison,

133
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:30,357
but we're not even sure
we're going to trial

134
00:06:30,438 --> 00:06:31,492
on the Krieger case yet.

135
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,325
It's only being arraigned
this afternoon...

136
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:34,778
I know, I just thought...
The truth is,

137
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:36,898
I have a hunch this one
won't even make it to court.

138
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:38,617
The defense lawyer
has already pushed

139
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,633
the arraignment
date four times,

140
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:41,722
which makes me think they're
having second thoughts.

141
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:43,074
I think they're going to
come in this afternoon,

142
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:45,299
simply plead guilty
and make a deal.

143
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:48,122
Excuse me.

144
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:51,551
Hello.

145
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:52,679
Mrs. Dubois.

146
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:55,368
This is Nurse Dunbar down
at Central Middle School?

147
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,670
I've got Ariel here,

148
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,966
and she's telling me
she's feeling pretty ill.

149
00:07:00,173 --> 00:07:01,415
What was I going to do, Joe?

150
00:07:01,494 --> 00:07:03,237
She obviously didn't want
to be there.

151
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:05,309
She was obviously scared
out of her mind.

152
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:07,949
So I told the nurse I'd be there
in, like, 45 minutes.

153
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:10,213
I don't know.

154
00:07:11,684 --> 00:07:13,594
It's like 12:30 now.

155
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:15,341
I just figured
I'd try to rush her home,

156
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:16,803
and get back...

157
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,087
BRIDGETTE:
Daddy, I think
I see her eyes moving.

158
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,750
Darling? Hey.

159
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,935
Hey.

160
00:07:50,558 --> 00:07:51,545
Are you awake?

161
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:53,367
Do you see us?

162
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:56,804
Hey, you got a lot of
drugs in you, baby.

163
00:07:58,285 --> 00:07:59,764
Your-your face is
all stitched up,

164
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,484
so they don't
want you to speak.

165
00:08:02,412 --> 00:08:05,220
You just blink once if
you know we're here, okay?

166
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:10,059
Mommy, this is all my fault.

167
00:08:10,395 --> 00:08:12,553
If I hadn't gone
to the nurse's office,

168
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,322
this would have never happened.

169
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:16,386
Sweetie, sweetie,
sweetie.

170
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:18,434
(sobbing)
Ariel, honey.

171
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:20,993
No, no, no,
sweetie, sweetie.

172
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:23,263
We talked about this,
we talked about this.

173
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:25,393
You know that's
not true, okay?

174
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:26,937
You know that's
not true.

175
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:29,967
Your mom is
going to be fine.

176
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,383
She's going
to be okay.

177
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:33,327
Sweetie, I
need you to go

178
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,062
to the vending machines
in the cafeteria. Okay?

179
00:08:36,202 --> 00:08:37,663
You need to take your
sister down there.

180
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:40,478
I need to talk to Mommy
for a second, okay?

181
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,076
Go on.

182
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,420
Go with your sister.

183
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:49,649
Mommy, I'm so sorry.

184
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,240
Hey.

185
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:07,363
Everyone's calling
to make sure you're okay--

186
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:10,204
everyone from work
and your brother,

187
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:12,955
the district attorney.

188
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:14,331
He wanted me to tell you

189
00:09:14,394 --> 00:09:16,553
that the arraignment went fine,
by the way.

190
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,161
I don't know what you remember.

191
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:23,161
I don't know what you know.

192
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:25,561
(sighing):
Um...

193
00:09:28,888 --> 00:09:31,717
This asshole went
right through the light,

194
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:34,494
He just went right through it.

195
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:37,957
Like 40 miles an hour.

196
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:40,685
Maybe he was high or something.

197
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,749
I don't know.

198
00:09:41,877 --> 00:09:43,285
Nobody's telling me anything.

199
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,740
<i>I do know--
here's the good news.</i>

200
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:53,274
Here's the cosmic joke
in all this.

201
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:57,267
There was a body
in the trunk of his car.

202
00:09:58,089 --> 00:09:59,387
A body.

203
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:01,560
And a blue duffle bag
filled with ammo

204
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:02,913
and an automatic weapon,

205
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:05,856
and blueprints for some
building downtown, so...

206
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:08,024
I mean,
we're all reasonably sure

207
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,255
that he wasn't rushing
to church, you know?

208
00:10:13,607 --> 00:10:15,255
That's my wife,

209
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:17,678
always out there
stopping the bad guys,

210
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:18,846
even when she...

211
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:22,087
(chuckling):
even when doesn't know
that she's doing it.

212
00:10:26,494 --> 00:10:27,789
Here's the thing.

213
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:31,980
You got hurt really bad.

214
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:37,013
Nothing that can't be fixed
with time and with therapy.

215
00:10:40,915 --> 00:10:42,550
Okay, this is ridiculous,

216
00:10:42,628 --> 00:10:44,489
'cause they told me
not to say anything.

217
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,557
Not until you
were fully conscious

218
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,389
and they had weaned you
off the drugs.

219
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:55,045
I guess they're right...
I guess they're right.

220
00:11:00,212 --> 00:11:01,731
Just know that...

221
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,156
that, you know,
we're going to...

222
00:11:05,276 --> 00:11:07,475
we're going to get you
everything you need.

223
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:12,707
Whatever it is,
whatever it costs.

224
00:11:16,825 --> 00:11:18,184
I love you, baby.

225
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:28,240
I love you.

226
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:55,331
Nurse.

227
00:11:56,211 --> 00:11:57,883
Nurse!

228
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:01,186
I have to go to the bathroom.

229
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:02,371
Is that the bathroom?

230
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:05,601
I have to go to the bathroom,
but I can't feel my legs.

231
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,522
Let me get
some help.

232
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:07,680
No, no, no,
we don't need any help.

233
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:08,753
You and I can do it.

234
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,296
My legs are asleep.

235
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:14,628
(screaming):
Oh, my God!

236
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,715
Uh...

237
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,763
Where are my legs?!
Where are my legs?!

238
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:36,329
You okay?

239
00:12:36,474 --> 00:12:37,784
Oh, man.

240
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,295
I had the most
horrible nightmare.

241
00:12:42,703 --> 00:12:44,247
I dreamt I totaled our car.

242
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:45,958
I lost both my legs.

243
00:12:46,102 --> 00:12:47,599
It was so vivid.

244
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:49,790
Cool.

245
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,734
The kids don't get up
for another ten minutes.

246
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:53,654
Oh, man.

247
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:55,564
I so believed
what I was dreaming.

248
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:57,837
I'm so relieved.

249
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:00,299
I feel like I...

250
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:03,528
I got the ultimate do-over,

251
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:07,146
like the universe gave me
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

252
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,990
Um, well, did you
use that card yet?

253
00:13:11,038 --> 00:13:12,875
Because I was
thinking that,

254
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,621
if you're still in jail, I could
really go for a conjugal visit.

255
00:13:19,821 --> 00:13:21,701
Come on.
Don't look at
me that way.

256
00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:24,875
Let me explain
something to you.

257
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,925
Sex isn't just sex.

258
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:28,236
Sex is good for you.

259
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:30,380
Sex releases
endorphins.

260
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:32,674
And endorphins
make you happy.

261
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:35,626
And right now, you look
like you could use

262
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:37,186
a little happiness.

263
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,578
I sure know I could.

264
00:13:42,497 --> 00:13:43,970
Girls, breakfast!

265
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:49,681
Mommy, can't I
have oatmeal?

266
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:50,473
Not this morning.

267
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:52,456
We're behind schedule,
this is faster.

268
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:54,447
Tread gently with
Mommy, Bridge.

269
00:13:54,704 --> 00:13:56,911
The woman's in dire need
of some endorphins.

270
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,712
Hmm?
ALLISON:
Where's Ariel?

271
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,600
We got to get move on.

272
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,675
I got to get to work.

273
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:01,991
Got an arraignment today.

274
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:03,558
What's an arraignment?

275
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:04,813
Ariel!

276
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:06,253
What's an arraignment?

277
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:07,246
Where's your sister?

278
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:08,694
Why is she not here?

279
00:14:08,838 --> 00:14:10,877
Ariel says she doesn't
want to go to school today.

280
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:12,501
What's an arraignment?

281
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,922
Why do you want to know
what an arraignment is?
You're only eight.

282
00:14:20,247 --> 00:14:21,922
I don't know.

283
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:23,356
ARIEL:
I'm here, I'm here,
I'm here.

284
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,755
But I'm not
going to school.

285
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,314
Is this about Amy Amson?

286
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:31,985
You're on the hot list,
she's not on the hot list?

287
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:33,920
That's so unfair
you can do that.

288
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:35,729
That is so cool
that you can do that.

289
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:37,569
What's everybody talking about?

290
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:38,809
What's she doing?

291
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:44,945
You want me to get that?

292
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,463
Hello?

293
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,990
May I ask who's calling?

294
00:14:52,088 --> 00:14:53,071
ARIEL:
Mom, this isn't funny.

295
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:55,160
It's really important
that I stay home.

296
00:14:55,486 --> 00:14:57,494
They want to talk
to a Mrs. Allison Dubois,

297
00:14:57,574 --> 00:14:59,679
and they won't say
what it's about.

298
00:15:00,807 --> 00:15:01,574
Hello?

299
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:02,989
MAN:
Mrs. Dubois, this is

300
00:15:03,097 --> 00:15:04,677
All Right Carpet
Cleaning Service.

301
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:05,701
I'm calling to offer you

302
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,049
a special half-off...
ARIEL:
Bridget!

303
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:08,077
Oops.

304
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:09,765
This is the same exact day.

305
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,203
Is that a yes?
JOE:
Ariel, here, take this.

306
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:12,651
Because for $19.95 an hour,

307
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,098
we can send a team
of professionals

308
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,485
to your house
to clean your carpets...

309
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:19,358
Here.

310
00:15:21,298 --> 00:15:22,185
I dreamt this.

311
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:23,621
I dreamt this whole morning.

312
00:15:23,785 --> 00:15:25,985
Everything-- the juice,
the phone call,

313
00:15:26,474 --> 00:15:28,640
Ariel wanting to stay
home from school.

314
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:30,706
Uh, okay. So?

315
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:31,881
Everything.

316
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:34,223
It's as if I lived
this day already.

317
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,059
And I'm gonna get in a horrible
car accident in a little while.

318
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:39,272
You're what?

319
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:40,511
No, wait, wait.

320
00:15:41,531 --> 00:15:43,292
I had that dream for a reason.

321
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:45,794
I can stop this from happening.

322
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:52,028
Hello.

323
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:53,559
Good morning, yeah.

324
00:15:53,622 --> 00:15:55,532
Is Detective Lee Scanlon in yet?

325
00:15:56,838 --> 00:15:58,711
Can I leave him a message?

326
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,103
My name's Allison Dubois.

327
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,534
Can you tell him
to meet me at the corner

328
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:03,759
of Mesa and Pueblo at 12:30?

329
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:06,173
Tell him
to look out for me.

330
00:16:06,237 --> 00:16:07,548
I'll be taking a cab.

331
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:10,692
Mom, can I please
stay home from school?

332
00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:12,698
No. No, you cannot.

333
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:15,134
And don't you dare
go to the nurse's office

334
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:16,352
and make me come and get you.

335
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,206
You will be grounded
the rest of eighth grade.

336
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:22,165
Endorphins.

337
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:26,763
Just so you know,
I was supposed to

338
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,915
have lunch with a certain
someone who works for the Mayor.

339
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:31,050
You may have to vouch for me
at a later date.

340
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:32,730
Consider yourself vouched.

341
00:16:32,845 --> 00:16:34,027
Now, what is it
we're looking for?

342
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,881
In about one minute, a
man's gonna go through

343
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:37,474
this traffic signal.

344
00:16:37,584 --> 00:16:39,105
There'll be a dead man
in the trunk of his car,

345
00:16:39,184 --> 00:16:42,712
along with about 100 rounds
of ammo, automatic weapon,

346
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:45,512
not to mention blueprints
to a building downtown.

347
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:47,616
If I'd driven
myself here today,

348
00:16:47,752 --> 00:16:50,087
I believe that he would've been
fated to run through the light

349
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:51,543
and hit me with his car.

350
00:16:51,672 --> 00:16:53,263
But since I got
here early by cab,

351
00:16:54,104 --> 00:16:55,886
my hope is that he will
go through the light

352
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:58,439
without incident, you will
arrest him and prevent him

353
00:16:58,494 --> 00:17:01,024
from whatever awful thing he
was bound and determined to do.

354
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:02,021
You with me?

355
00:17:02,084 --> 00:17:03,612
And you know this
because...?

356
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,764
Because of the wonderful
things she does.

357
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:07,595
That traffic light
right there?

358
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:10,986
That light there.
Black sedan.

359
00:17:12,178 --> 00:17:13,247
Like that one.

360
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:15,587
Oh, boy, I get to use my siren.

361
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:32,541
Wait here.

362
00:17:46,603 --> 00:17:48,225
Well, this is
embarrassing.

363
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:51,122
I ran a red light
back there, didn't I?

364
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:52,473
You certainly did.

365
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,913
Your Honor.

366
00:18:15,143 --> 00:18:16,598
I don't understand.

367
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:20,854
I don't know
what to tell you.

368
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:21,814
It's pretty
cut and dried.

369
00:18:21,856 --> 00:18:24,252
I just pulled over a
Federal Court Judge.

370
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:25,685
A Federal Court Judge.

371
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,373
The Honorable
James T. Whitman.

372
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:29,284
Nice fellow,
crappy golfer.

373
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:30,307
What about his trunk?

374
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,948
I didn't see you
look in his trunk.

375
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:33,955
That's 'cause I didn't
look in his trunk, Allison.

376
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,244
He's a Federal
Court Judge.

377
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:37,465
What part of Federal Court
Judge don't you understand?

378
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:39,226
I'm not about to ask that
man to open his trunk

379
00:18:39,282 --> 00:18:40,842
when I have no
probable cause.

380
00:18:41,314 --> 00:18:42,257
The last time
I checked,

381
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:44,336
your dreams do not
constitute probable cause.

382
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:55,592
You want some lunch?

383
00:18:55,847 --> 00:18:57,192
I'll buy you lunch.

384
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:06,601
Hello?

385
00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:09,044
This is Nurse Dunbar
down at Central Middle School.

386
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:11,125
I've got Ariel here,

387
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:13,659
and, please
don't be alarmed,

388
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:15,653
but another child
here at the school

389
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,085
has apparently given
Ariel a black eye.

390
00:19:18,172 --> 00:19:19,380
A black eye?

391
00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:20,710
We've got some ice on it,

392
00:19:20,748 --> 00:19:22,028
and I'm sure
in an hour or so

393
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:23,578
she'll be fine
to return to class.

394
00:19:23,892 --> 00:19:25,057
Oh, my God,
this is horrible.

395
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,737
Is she okay?
Can I talk to her?

396
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,101
Um, actually, um, she's laying
down at the moment, Mrs. Dubois.

397
00:19:34,402 --> 00:19:37,147
MAN (over radio):
All units in the vicinity...
I want to come pick her up.
Tell her I'll be right there.

398
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:38,202
Thank you.

399
00:19:38,402 --> 00:19:39,970
...reporting a possible
hostage situation

400
00:19:40,006 --> 00:19:41,249
at the Florenzo Ristorante.

401
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:42,858
I'm afraid you're not
going anywhere soon.

402
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:50,529
I was in the
neighborhood,

403
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:51,687
I heard you guys
were up to no good.

404
00:19:51,744 --> 00:19:53,417
JACKSON:
Well, somebody's
up to no good.

405
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:54,897
About 35 minutes ago,

406
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:57,176
911 got a call from inside
the restaurant about a robbery.

407
00:19:57,232 --> 00:20:00,039
When the first
responding officer arrived,

408
00:20:00,094 --> 00:20:01,519
the perpetrator
was still inside.

409
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:04,103
He's holed up in there
with 57 hostages.

410
00:20:04,242 --> 00:20:05,261
How many?

411
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:07,846
I've got sharpshooters on
all the surrounding rooftops.

412
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,231
And the hostage negotiator
just got off the phone.

413
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:12,182
What's he want?
What's he asking for?

414
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:13,309
That's the fun part.

415
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:14,485
He wants nothing.

416
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:16,318
He's made no real demands.

417
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:18,420
Just wants us to wait out here
till 5:00 p.m.

418
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,588
Then he'll release the hostages
and give back the money.

419
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,545
That makes no sense.
Tell me about it.

420
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:24,520
Excuse me, Captain Jackson,
could you follow me?

421
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,085
Lee.

422
00:20:32,776 --> 00:20:34,246
Take a look at that.

423
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:36,806
Is that who I think it is?

424
00:20:36,924 --> 00:20:38,598
Man, this guy's really
pushing his luck.

425
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,111
A handicapped spot.

426
00:20:40,597 --> 00:20:41,717
I'm not imagining
it, right?

427
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,788
That's that
judge's car.

428
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,171
Well, I guess today
is not his lucky day.

429
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:48,624
I don't know
what to do.

430
00:20:48,676 --> 00:20:49,594
I dreamt about
that car.

431
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:52,483
Now that that car's here, I'd
kind of like to stay if I could.

432
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:54,364
Let me go call
my husband.

433
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,577
MAN (over radio):
Central Command,
this is Watchtower. Over.

434
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:05,960
I'm on the northeast corner

435
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:07,864
of the roof of
the adjacent building.

436
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,440
From my vantage point, sir,
it appears someone is attempting

437
00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:13,271
to make their way out of the
rear entrance of the restaurant.

438
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:15,912
It's a glass door,

439
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:18,767
and I keep seeing them
approach it and then hesitate.

440
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:20,975
To be honest, sir,
I don't know if I'm looking

441
00:21:21,054 --> 00:21:23,205
at a hostage
or the hostage taker.

442
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:25,054
Can you describe him?

443
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:27,494
Male, approximately
six-feet-tall,

444
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:30,117
shirt and tie,
looks like he's got a mask on,

445
00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:32,500
carrying some kind of
blue gym bag.

446
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:34,764
Judge Whitman.

447
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:36,515
In my dream,

448
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,388
there was a blue gym bag
in the trunk of the car,

449
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,147
along with the body,
along with the ammo,

450
00:21:41,205 --> 00:21:42,523
along with
an automatic weapon.

451
00:21:42,653 --> 00:21:44,443
Sir, I stopped
a suspicious-looking person

452
00:21:44,498 --> 00:21:46,499
matching that description
earlier today.

453
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:48,376
He comes through the door

454
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:50,319
and gives you any reason
to believe he's anything

455
00:21:50,354 --> 00:21:52,827
other than a hostage,
shoot to immobilize.

456
00:21:54,337 --> 00:21:55,473
MAN (over radio):
Here he comes.

457
00:21:56,504 --> 00:21:58,320
He's out.
He's got a weapon.

458
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,320
I'm taking my shot.

459
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:09,002
He's down.
Repeat. Man is down.

460
00:22:09,117 --> 00:22:10,869
He's just outside the rear
of the building.

461
00:22:20,188 --> 00:22:20,978
Sir.

462
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:23,307
I need you to
release your weapon.

463
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:33,868
It's taped to him
or something.

464
00:22:51,531 --> 00:22:52,827
We shot the wrong guy.

465
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:01,634
His-his gun jammed.

466
00:23:01,765 --> 00:23:03,010
It jammed.

467
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:05,193
Judge Whitman...

468
00:23:05,681 --> 00:23:07,608
He taped this
gun to his hand, he...

469
00:23:07,722 --> 00:23:10,188
gave him that bag,
he pushed him out the back door.

470
00:23:10,273 --> 00:23:12,625
So he could leave out the front
with the rest of the hostages.

471
00:23:46,577 --> 00:23:48,495
Do you need help
deciding what to wear?

472
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:53,400
It's clean.
It's absolutely clean.

473
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,456
What day is today?

474
00:23:55,912 --> 00:23:57,296
Mmm. Friday.

475
00:23:57,807 --> 00:23:59,111
Thank God.

476
00:24:00,518 --> 00:24:02,438
Wait...
I feel a hackneyed phrase

477
00:24:02,494 --> 00:24:03,839
coming on.

478
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,717
It passed.

479
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,950
Okay, but why would a
federal judge do that?

480
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,076
Rob a restaurant?

481
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:12,989
Hold hostages?
I don't know.

482
00:24:13,092 --> 00:24:14,420
He's not doing it for the money.

483
00:24:14,508 --> 00:24:16,884
He sends the money out
with one of the hostages.

484
00:24:18,284 --> 00:24:19,924
Assuming any of this is real.

485
00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:21,308
Assuming any of this

486
00:24:21,403 --> 00:24:24,076
is actually going
to happen, I mean...

487
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:25,700
it was just a dream.

488
00:24:26,946 --> 00:24:28,339
What?

489
00:24:28,505 --> 00:24:30,937
No, just... I love
that you said that.

490
00:24:30,994 --> 00:24:33,049
I mean, normally I'd
be the one to say that.

491
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:34,577
Yeah.

492
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,466
Well, it just occurred to me
when I woke up,

493
00:24:36,521 --> 00:24:39,594
when I realized that my jacket
wasn't covered with blood.

494
00:24:39,682 --> 00:24:41,929
None of what I had dreamt
had happened.

495
00:24:42,097 --> 00:24:44,287
I felt relief.
I still feel relief.

496
00:24:44,592 --> 00:24:46,577
Excellent.
Relief is good.

497
00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:47,965
You know,

498
00:24:48,011 --> 00:24:49,151
it's hard to explain it.

499
00:24:49,436 --> 00:24:53,018
Every time I dream the dream,
there are certain cues.

500
00:24:53,131 --> 00:24:55,719
There are certain things
that happen at the start.

501
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:56,884
But this morning...

502
00:24:56,972 --> 00:24:58,305
the fact that
the kids aren't up,

503
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,201
the fact that we're up early.

504
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:02,475
This is different.

505
00:25:02,593 --> 00:25:04,922
Gee, we are up kind of early.

506
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:10,175
Hey, here's a crazy idea.

507
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:15,160
How about we go back
to bed and not sleep.

508
00:25:15,655 --> 00:25:16,792
Hmm?

509
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:21,975
Was that a "no"?

510
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,896
Yeah.

511
00:25:22,951 --> 00:25:23,725
No.

512
00:25:23,782 --> 00:25:25,070
But it's not why you think...
I just...

513
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:26,517
I don't want
to have this conversation.

514
00:25:26,597 --> 00:25:27,794
Cool. Kill the
conversation.

515
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,926
I'll race you
to the bedroom.
No.

516
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,217
Change the conversation.

517
00:25:30,273 --> 00:25:31,647
I don't want to have it.

518
00:25:31,832 --> 00:25:32,479
Wait a second...

519
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:34,104
which "it" don't
you want to have?

520
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,208
Either "it."

521
00:25:35,287 --> 00:25:36,608
I don't want to have
the conversation.

522
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:38,167
I don't want to have sex.
Allison,

523
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,647
let me explain
something to you.

524
00:25:39,716 --> 00:25:40,941
Sex isn't just sex.

525
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,358
Sex is good for you.

526
00:25:42,537 --> 00:25:44,406
Sex releases
endorphins.
(moans)

527
00:25:44,494 --> 00:25:46,827
And endorphins, they
make you happy.

528
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:47,600
And right now,

529
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:49,644
you look like you could
use a little happiness.

530
00:25:49,766 --> 00:25:50,846
I sure know

531
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:52,624
I could.
Oh, my God.

532
00:25:53,013 --> 00:25:54,093
Guess what?

533
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,897
Ariel doesn't want
to go to school today.

534
00:25:56,058 --> 00:25:56,750
How... ?

535
00:25:58,961 --> 00:26:00,734
You want to know what
an arraignment is?

536
00:26:00,815 --> 00:26:02,831
Huh?
Well, trust me, you will.

537
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,476
Ariel, let's go.

538
00:26:04,532 --> 00:26:06,083
Let's get the show
on the road.

539
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,571
Mom...
I know all about it.

540
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:10,889
You're hot. She's not.

541
00:26:10,972 --> 00:26:13,699
But you're not staying home from
school because of some bully.

542
00:26:13,802 --> 00:26:16,666
The girl's got you completely
intimidated and that's crazy.

543
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,109
You know what you have to do?

544
00:26:18,235 --> 00:26:19,649
Intimidate her.

545
00:26:19,737 --> 00:26:20,794
That's right, you have
to go to school

546
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:22,261
with a little less of
that "I'm pretty,

547
00:26:22,313 --> 00:26:24,211
I'm smart, I'm
well-behaved" thing

548
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,576
and get yourself
a little bit of

549
00:26:26,638 --> 00:26:27,671
badass!

550
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,816
Mom!
Allison?

551
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,237
You know what
I'm saying.
Don't pretend you don't know

552
00:26:30,273 --> 00:26:31,588
what I'm saying. Badass,

553
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:34,490
badass, badass.

554
00:26:34,554 --> 00:26:36,386
You got to get yourself
a little attitude,

555
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:38,082
Ariel Dubois,
and you got to give it

556
00:26:38,123 --> 00:26:39,177
to that girl.

557
00:26:39,305 --> 00:26:40,273
Joe, back me up here.

558
00:26:40,314 --> 00:26:41,258
Your father and I

559
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:43,590
do not want you to spend
your whole life afraid

560
00:26:43,716 --> 00:26:44,890
some girl's going
to hit you.

561
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:49,840
that you are going to hit her.

562
00:26:49,896 --> 00:26:51,023
JOE:
Hey.

563
00:26:51,063 --> 00:26:51,935
Are you okay?

564
00:26:51,975 --> 00:26:53,160
Do you follow what I'm saying?

565
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:54,111
Attitude.

566
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,447
I'm trying to
teach this girl

567
00:26:55,512 --> 00:26:56,327
something here.
(telephone rings)

568
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:57,455
Here, look, follow.

569
00:26:57,517 --> 00:26:58,815
Watch this, okay.

570
00:26:58,855 --> 00:27:02,134
No!
No, no, no.

571
00:27:02,157 --> 00:27:04,149
No, you listen to me
you scum sucking,

572
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,046
bottom-feeding,

573
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:07,326
hide-behind-a-telephone-headset
piece of garbage.

574
00:27:07,365 --> 00:27:09,758
you ever call my house
again during breakfast,

575
00:27:09,821 --> 00:27:13,028
I will personally come to
your carpet cleaning company,

576
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:15,628
I will find you and
I will hurt you.

577
00:27:15,684 --> 00:27:17,188
And when I'm
finished with you,

578
00:27:17,277 --> 00:27:19,228
nothing and no one
will ever be able to

579
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:20,779
to get your stain out.

580
00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:23,363
Okay, you get the gist?

581
00:27:23,619 --> 00:27:24,425
All right.

582
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,131
Everybody ready for work?

583
00:27:27,963 --> 00:27:29,747
I have an arraignment
to get ready for.

584
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:30,986
What's an arraign...?

585
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,473
Too late.

586
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:37,151
ALLISON:
I know it's
kind of hard to follow.

587
00:27:37,326 --> 00:27:39,271
No, I... I think
I follow you.

588
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:40,685
You want us to arrest
a federal judge

589
00:27:40,766 --> 00:27:43,125
for a crime he
hasn't committed. Yet.

590
00:27:43,216 --> 00:27:45,185
Look, maybe there's some other
way I haven't thought of yet.

591
00:27:45,254 --> 00:27:47,218
I'm just worried if we
don't do something come 1:00,

592
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:48,835
you're going to get a 911 call

593
00:27:48,892 --> 00:27:50,561
from inside
the Florenzo Ristorante.

594
00:27:50,617 --> 00:27:53,226
Once that happens,
it's already too late.

595
00:27:54,641 --> 00:27:55,511
Allison...

596
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,327
look at it from my side.

597
00:27:57,449 --> 00:27:59,144
You have been wrong
from time to time.

598
00:27:59,201 --> 00:28:00,663
Besides what is it
we're supposed
to arrest him for

599
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:02,867
if he hasn't done
anything yet?
I don't know.

600
00:28:02,908 --> 00:28:05,107
All I know is,
this is the third time

601
00:28:05,163 --> 00:28:06,321
I have lived
this same day.

602
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:09,039
Twice now, I have
tried to stop this man.

603
00:28:09,497 --> 00:28:12,177
Both times I failed, people
have been hurt or killed.

604
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,928
You almost had him yesterday.

605
00:28:14,238 --> 00:28:14,911
Excuse me?

606
00:28:14,975 --> 00:28:17,079
You found out he was a judge,
you wouldn't check his trunk.

607
00:28:17,143 --> 00:28:20,206
If you had, you would have
found a dead body in it.

608
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,638
What?

609
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,406
I have absolutely
no recollection

610
00:28:24,478 --> 00:28:26,174
of any of this.
Because it
hasn't happened yet.

611
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:27,550
Wait a second,
I have an idea,

612
00:28:27,638 --> 00:28:29,211
it might even be legal.

613
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:30,414
Why don't you and Allison

614
00:28:30,485 --> 00:28:32,485
walk down to the
judge's chambers right now.

615
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:34,468
Explain to him that a car,

616
00:28:34,524 --> 00:28:35,780
matching the description
of his honor's,

617
00:28:35,835 --> 00:28:38,332
appears to have been used
in the commission of a crime

618
00:28:38,405 --> 00:28:39,843
you're investigating.
Ask the judge

619
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,683
if he wouldn't kindly
allow you to confirm

620
00:28:41,732 --> 00:28:43,476
that the car is still
parked where he left it.

621
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,082
And if he would consent

622
00:28:45,148 --> 00:28:46,253
to letting you take
a peek in his trunk.

623
00:28:46,301 --> 00:28:47,897
If the car is still there,
there's nothing in the trunk,

624
00:28:47,945 --> 00:28:49,972
no harm, no foul.
I don't know.

625
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:51,314
He's a judge.

626
00:28:52,715 --> 00:28:53,851
It's almost lunch.

627
00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:55,507
Don't worry.
I'll call her.

628
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:57,546
She'll understand. Thanks.

629
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:02,656
Morning.

630
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:03,528
My name is Lee Scanlon.

631
00:29:03,585 --> 00:29:04,865
I telephoned about
five minutes ago.

632
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:07,183
Spoke with an aide,
asked if there was any way

633
00:29:07,227 --> 00:29:08,480
I can get a look
at his honor's car

634
00:29:08,564 --> 00:29:10,759
as part of a criminal
investigation we're conducting.

635
00:29:10,848 --> 00:29:12,192
I was told
to speak to you.

636
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:13,760
That you would know
where it was parked.

637
00:29:13,863 --> 00:29:14,558
I'm sorry.

638
00:29:14,623 --> 00:29:15,735
I'm going to need a minute.

639
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:17,206
I'm going to have
to check with his honor.

640
00:29:17,264 --> 00:29:19,094
Nobody told me about this.

641
00:29:19,407 --> 00:29:20,398
Who's that?

642
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,790
SECRETARY:
Well, that's Judge Whitman.

643
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:24,822
Are you sure?

644
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,397
I've worked for the man
for 26 years.

645
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:29,230
I think I know
what he looks like.

646
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:30,749
Allison?

647
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:33,508
Doesn't
make sense.
What's going on?

648
00:29:33,657 --> 00:29:36,563
The person I saw yesterday
was a different Judge Whitman.

649
00:29:36,964 --> 00:29:37,891
Trust me.

650
00:29:37,998 --> 00:29:40,124
There are
no other Judge Whitmans.

651
00:29:40,796 --> 00:29:42,901
Don't feel bad, this
is a good thing.

652
00:29:43,187 --> 00:29:45,058
At least we know our federal
court system isn't run

653
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:47,345
by a bunch of gun-
wielding maniacs.

654
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:50,702
Besides, now I can
still make my lunch.

655
00:29:51,376 --> 00:29:52,855
No, you can't.

656
00:29:54,046 --> 00:29:57,022
I cancelled for you,
before we came.

657
00:29:58,454 --> 00:29:59,565
Okay.

658
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,196
You hungry?

659
00:30:04,964 --> 00:30:06,292
Sure.

660
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,458
Hello?

661
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,186
Mrs. Dubois,
this is Nurse Dunbar

662
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,058
down at Central
Middle School.

663
00:30:16,177 --> 00:30:18,158
I've got Ariel here and...

664
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:19,326
ALLISON:
Yes?

665
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:20,877
Mrs. Dubois?

666
00:30:21,014 --> 00:30:23,840
This is Principal Phillips.
I'm here with your daughter,

667
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,156
Ariel, and I'm
afraid we've have

668
00:30:25,221 --> 00:30:27,379
ourselves a very
serious situation here.

669
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:29,020
Oh my goodness,
is she alright?

670
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:32,900
Oh, she's fine,
but apparently ????????

671
00:30:32,935 --> 00:30:36,263
Now we consider that a very
serious matter, Mrs. Dubois.

672
00:30:36,304 --> 00:30:37,279
I mean this is something

673
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:40,143
that's going to go
on her permanent record.
Oh, my God.

674
00:30:40,343 --> 00:30:42,159
I mean, frankly, Mrs.
Dubois, I've never seen

675
00:30:42,214 --> 00:30:45,533
this kind of behavior,
this kind of attitude
from Ariel before.

676
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:48,283
Wherever it came from,
we need to nip it in the bud.

677
00:30:48,363 --> 00:30:49,282
Yes.

678
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,538
Thank you.

679
00:30:51,635 --> 00:30:53,201
Everything okay?
Yeah.

680
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:57,114
No, it's Ariel.
It's a school thing.

681
00:30:58,234 --> 00:30:59,738
She's such a good kid.

682
00:31:03,976 --> 00:31:05,159
So I guess you've
been here before.

683
00:31:05,257 --> 00:31:07,349
What's good?
What time do you have?

684
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:11,096
Uh, 1:16.
I don't get it.

685
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:13,239
Yesterday you said that
the police got a phone call

686
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,310
at 1:00 p.m. about a robbery.

687
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:17,694
I never talked
to you yesterday, Allison.

688
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:18,911
That yesterday never happened.

689
00:31:18,935 --> 00:31:20,374
That yesterday was a dream.

690
00:31:20,502 --> 00:31:21,629
WAITER:
Hi, my name is David.

691
00:31:21,734 --> 00:31:23,079
I'll be your, uh, your server.

692
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:24,969
Would you guys like
to hear today's specials?

693
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:26,889
Uh, yeah.
Okay, we, uh,

694
00:31:26,913 --> 00:31:28,400
MAN:
Can you check in
with the maitre d'

695
00:31:28,442 --> 00:31:30,965
and see if there's been a call
from Judge Whitman?

696
00:31:31,111 --> 00:31:32,999
He should of been here
15 minutes ago.

697
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,542
Did you hear that?
Yeah.

698
00:31:35,598 --> 00:31:37,053
I'm not a big fan
of the goat cheese.

699
00:31:37,135 --> 00:31:38,469
You know, you go right ahead.

700
00:31:38,574 --> 00:31:39,876
No, the man at that table

701
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,734
just mentioned Judge Whitman.

702
00:31:42,189 --> 00:31:44,103
I wasn't wrong, there
is a connection.

703
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:45,821
Should I give you guys a minute?
Yeah.

704
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:52,285
Look around, Allison.

705
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:55,001
This restaurant
is not being robbed.

706
00:31:55,715 --> 00:31:56,904
MASKED MAN:
Everyone stay still.

707
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,121
This is a robbery.

708
00:31:58,178 --> 00:32:00,302
If you move, you die.

709
00:32:00,383 --> 00:32:02,333
Everyone out of the bar,
everyone out of

710
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:04,440
the kitchen now,
move it, move it.

711
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:05,837
You hear that?
That was fast.

712
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:06,791
(distant sirens wailing)
It's almost as if

713
00:32:06,855 --> 00:32:09,141
someone phoned it in
before it even happened.

714
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:10,395
Quiet!

715
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,907
Now I want everyone
to put on a mask and get down

716
00:32:14,987 --> 00:32:17,794
on the ground... now.

717
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,362
Move, move, move.

718
00:32:19,651 --> 00:32:20,851
Down on the ground now.

719
00:32:21,353 --> 00:32:22,914
Everyone out of the kitchen.

720
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:24,073
Out here.

721
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:30,848
What you got
in there, fella?

722
00:32:32,961 --> 00:32:34,803
My asthma medication.

723
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,460
Well, you look fine to me.

724
00:32:38,825 --> 00:32:40,297
Both hands in the air.

725
00:32:40,736 --> 00:32:42,328
And they better be empty.

726
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:48,128
All right, stand up.

727
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:50,375
Slowly.

728
00:32:56,238 --> 00:32:57,790
Open the jacket.

729
00:33:04,422 --> 00:33:05,820
Well...

730
00:33:06,142 --> 00:33:09,083
that's some serious asthma
you got, huh?

731
00:33:10,964 --> 00:33:12,636
Here's what
we're going to do.

732
00:33:13,103 --> 00:33:15,027
You're going to take
off the holster

733
00:33:15,181 --> 00:33:16,667
and put it on the table,

734
00:33:16,804 --> 00:33:18,785
and then you are going to
back away from the table.

735
00:33:18,813 --> 00:33:20,547
Do you understand me?

736
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,935
Anytime.

737
00:33:32,104 --> 00:33:33,159
Lee, don't.

738
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,960
His gun doesn't work.

739
00:33:38,871 --> 00:33:42,175
Remove that holster now
or I will pull this trigger.

740
00:33:42,294 --> 00:33:43,358
Lee, don't.

741
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:45,246
The gun's going to jam,
trust me.

742
00:33:57,084 --> 00:34:00,237
You were right, his gun did jam.

743
00:34:10,738 --> 00:34:11,850
Who is he?

744
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:16,185
Michael Williams.

745
00:34:31,662 --> 00:34:32,911
Bulletproof vest.

746
00:34:58,293 --> 00:35:01,295
Joe? Joe, honey, wake up,
I've got to ask you something.

747
00:35:03,215 --> 00:35:04,278
What's the matter?

748
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,285
What's going on?

749
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:07,917
What day is today?

750
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:09,101
Hmm?

751
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,676
You hate me,
don't you?

752
00:35:14,276 --> 00:35:17,840
I mean, deep
down inside,

753
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,403
there's gotta be
like an anger thing.

754
00:35:20,697 --> 00:35:23,952
Otherwise, why would a
person wake a person?

755
00:35:24,607 --> 00:35:25,765
Is it Friday?

756
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,351
Yes, it's Friday.

757
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,110
(sighs):
Oh, thank God.

758
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:32,031
Wait.

759
00:35:32,191 --> 00:35:34,222
BOTH:
I feel a hackneyed phrase
coming on.

760
00:35:35,422 --> 00:35:38,003
Wait. It passed.

761
00:35:42,956 --> 00:35:44,995
Why would he want a
hostage situation?

762
00:35:45,075 --> 00:35:46,828
No, no, I'm not buying it.

763
00:35:46,883 --> 00:35:49,273
He releases all the
hostages at 5:00 p.m.

764
00:35:50,154 --> 00:35:51,393
Well, maybe he's just
trying to get people

765
00:35:51,477 --> 00:35:52,255
out of work
for the afternoon.

766
00:35:52,345 --> 00:35:54,479
Maybe I should bring
my engineering team
to lunch there.

767
00:35:54,591 --> 00:35:56,440
Ah, yeah, well,
good luck.

768
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,310
That place was packed.

769
00:35:58,527 --> 00:36:00,207
Scanlon and I could
hardly get a table.

770
00:36:00,294 --> 00:36:01,935
I don't think they
could accommodate...

771
00:36:06,551 --> 00:36:07,668
I almost forgot.

772
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,044
At the restaurant,
there was this table,

773
00:36:09,118 --> 00:36:11,172
seemed like 20 people.

774
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:14,084
And one of them asked e waiter
about Judge Whitman.

775
00:36:14,244 --> 00:36:16,699
But I thought you said that
the gunman wasn't Judge Whitman.

776
00:36:16,755 --> 00:36:18,843
It was some guy named Williams.

777
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,938
Right. But he told Scanlon
he was Judge Whitman

778
00:36:20,994 --> 00:36:22,079
when we pulled him over.

779
00:36:22,154 --> 00:36:23,979
An he was driving
Judge Whitman's car.

780
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,378
So what are you saying?

781
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:27,546
Remember you told me
there was a dead body

782
00:36:27,611 --> 00:36:28,858
in the trunk of that car?

783
00:36:29,194 --> 00:36:30,256
No. When was that?

784
00:36:30,296 --> 00:36:32,141
Today. In the hospital.
A couple of hours from now.

785
00:36:32,184 --> 00:36:33,313
Never mind. I remember.

786
00:36:33,376 --> 00:36:35,664
I think this guy Williams might
have killed Judge Whitman.

787
00:36:35,729 --> 00:36:37,464
I think he might have
killed Judge Whitman

788
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,768
and stuffed Whitman in
the trunk of his own car.

789
00:36:40,184 --> 00:36:41,472
Okay. Why?

790
00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:43,542
That I don't know.

791
00:36:46,149 --> 00:36:48,154
Florenzo Ristorante.
This is David.

792
00:36:48,532 --> 00:36:52,411
Hi. Um, I'm supposed to attend
a lunch at your restaurant today

793
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,890
and for the life of me
I can't remember

794
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:55,570
what time the reservation
is for.

795
00:36:56,226 --> 00:36:59,003
Well, what name
is the reservation under?

796
00:36:59,346 --> 00:37:00,130
I don't know.

797
00:37:00,346 --> 00:37:01,310
Uh, it's a big party.

798
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:02,761
Maybe 20 people.

799
00:37:03,073 --> 00:37:04,418
Judge Whitman's party?

800
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,713
Yes.

801
00:37:05,904 --> 00:37:07,847
Yeah, we got you down here
for 12:45.

802
00:37:08,465 --> 00:37:09,946
Uh, great.

803
00:37:10,088 --> 00:37:11,023
It wouldn't happen to say there

804
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,560
who else might be attending,
would it?

805
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,049
No, I'm sorry, ma'am.

806
00:37:14,087 --> 00:37:17,262
All I know is we were told
to be seen and not heard.

807
00:37:17,337 --> 00:37:20,407
Something about every judge in
the county being at that table

808
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,736
???????

809
00:37:22,971 --> 00:37:23,870
Really?

810
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:26,398
Uh, thank you so much
for your help.

811
00:37:27,468 --> 00:37:29,644
Every judge in the county is
going to be at that restaurant.

812
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:30,677
I have to go see Devalos.

813
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:32,140
Can you take the
kids to school?

814
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,381
Yeah, of course I can,
um, but wait a second.

815
00:37:34,435 --> 00:37:36,099
I need to talk to you
about something.

816
00:37:36,404 --> 00:37:37,461
Endorphins?

817
00:37:37,617 --> 00:37:38,742
As a matter of fact.

818
00:37:38,835 --> 00:37:40,925
Heard you can get them
from running, which is
what I got to do.

819
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,234
Girls, Daddy is going to be
driving you this morning.

820
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:47,186
Mom...
Ariel, I want you to stay
home from school today.

821
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:48,618
What?
Bridgette,

822
00:37:48,674 --> 00:37:51,098
an arraignment is when someone
pleads innocent or guilty.

823
00:37:51,153 --> 00:37:52,529
(phone ringing)
BRIDGETTE:
Are you talking to me?

824
00:37:52,634 --> 00:37:53,953
Marie, say hi to the nice man.

825
00:37:54,009 --> 00:37:55,753
Bye, girls,
see you tonight.

826
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:59,319
MAN (on phone):
Hello? This is All Right
carpet cleaning service. Hello?

827
00:38:00,663 --> 00:38:01,892
Can I ask you a question?

828
00:38:02,507 --> 00:38:03,644
Don't ask me
how I know this,

829
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:06,251
but a man is going to hold every
judge in the county hostage

830
00:38:06,316 --> 00:38:08,076
from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. today.

831
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:09,829
Okay.

832
00:38:10,004 --> 00:38:11,747
What changes?
What does that effect?

833
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:13,203
How does that
make the world different?

834
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:15,116
Well, I don't know.

835
00:38:15,197 --> 00:38:16,689
I suppose if the court
doesn't have a judge

836
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:18,722
to preside over its cases
on a given day,

837
00:38:18,874 --> 00:38:21,041
then the court proceedings
don't happen on that day.

838
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:22,546
What could be gained by that?

839
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:23,722
Nothing.

840
00:38:23,836 --> 00:38:27,000
Everything would just be
rescheduled until the next day.

841
00:38:27,656 --> 00:38:29,087
Unless...
What?

842
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,615
Unless somehow the proceedings
are time sensitive.

843
00:38:31,697 --> 00:38:32,406
What do you mean?

844
00:38:32,446 --> 00:38:34,454
Like my arraignment this
afternoon, for instance.

845
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:37,037
What about that arraignment
makes it time sensitive?

846
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,415
Normally it's no big deal.

847
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,894
But the law mandates that
a defendant's arraignment

848
00:38:41,951 --> 00:38:44,807
be held within ten days of
the person's indictment.

849
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,558
But as it happens, in
this particular case,

850
00:38:46,613 --> 00:38:48,396
the defense attorney
has worked very hard

851
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:49,966
to get that arraignment
date pushed back

852
00:38:50,031 --> 00:38:54,322
until the final day of the ten
day window, which is today.

853
00:38:54,497 --> 00:38:56,581
What if that arraignment
doesn't happen today?

854
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:59,555
The defendant's due process
is violated-- he's released.

855
00:39:01,322 --> 00:39:03,146
That's why
this is all happening.

856
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:05,419
That's why "what"
is all happening?

857
00:39:05,462 --> 00:39:06,793
This hostage thing
you mentioned?

858
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:07,850
Where is this coming from?

859
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:10,358
I had a dream-- well, I had
three dreams actually.

860
00:39:10,385 --> 00:39:12,075
Allison, you're losing me.

861
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:14,683
What makes you think that
your dream hostage taker

862
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:17,433
has a connection with
the Krieger arraignment?

863
00:39:17,571 --> 00:39:19,601
I don't know.
His name is Michael Williams.

864
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:21,713
That's really
about all I can tell you.

865
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,273
Michael Williams?

866
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:27,391
Krieger has a wife.

867
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,065
Her maiden name
is Williams.

868
00:39:29,991 --> 00:39:31,912
She has a brother named Michael.

869
00:39:32,116 --> 00:39:33,854
The very first dream,

870
00:39:34,335 --> 00:39:37,693
I came to talk to you about
a second shooter in that case.

871
00:39:37,774 --> 00:39:38,518
And what did I do?

872
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:40,269
You shooed me
out of the room.

873
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,557
Not this time.

874
00:39:42,357 --> 00:39:44,093
Get me Detective
Scanlon please.

875
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:47,864
Everyone stay still!
This is a robbery!

876
00:39:48,093 --> 00:39:48,997
You move, you die!

877
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,561
I want everyone out of the bar!
Everyone out of the...!

878
00:39:50,618 --> 00:39:51,869
SCANLON:
Boys...

879
00:39:51,943 --> 00:39:54,774
He's wearing a bulletproof
vest-- aim for his head.

880
00:39:55,698 --> 00:39:57,135
Michael Williams...

881
00:39:57,271 --> 00:39:58,127
you're under arrest.

882
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:00,316
Drop the gun, put your
hands over your head.

883
00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:02,643
Okay.

884
00:40:29,076 --> 00:40:31,493
Hey. Are you okay?

885
00:40:31,854 --> 00:40:34,099
Hmm? Everything
all right?

886
00:40:34,261 --> 00:40:35,278
I don't know,
I think so.

887
00:40:35,347 --> 00:40:37,484
You wouldn't happen to know
what day it is, would you?

888
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,564
It's Saturday, darling.

889
00:40:40,676 --> 00:40:41,900
Why do you ask?

890
00:40:43,311 --> 00:40:44,508
I don't know.

891
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,314
It was a pretty
amazing week.

892
00:40:47,026 --> 00:40:48,930
I packed a lot
into last week.

893
00:40:48,971 --> 00:40:51,105
Packed a real lot
into yesterday.

894
00:40:51,218 --> 00:40:52,393
Mm-hmm.

895
00:40:52,505 --> 00:40:53,658
Hmm...

896
00:40:55,353 --> 00:41:00,545
Guess I'm kinda... sad,
kinda let down.

897
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:02,345
Kinda depressed.

898
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:04,351
After all
that excitement, I mean.

899
00:41:05,448 --> 00:41:06,551
You don't say.

900
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,530
Any thoughts?
Any suggestions?

901
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:12,943
I don't know.

902
00:41:13,246 --> 00:41:15,494
You could do
something physical.

903
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,998
That always helps.

904
00:41:17,117 --> 00:41:19,970
Creates endorphins,
elevates the mood.

905
00:41:20,428 --> 00:41:22,108
Hm, endorphins, huh?

906
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:23,213
Mm-hmm.

907
00:41:23,268 --> 00:41:24,235
Physical, huh?

908
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:27,260
Mm, yeah, you know,
running. Running's good.

909
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:31,222
Anything else?

910
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:33,442
Mm, let me think.

911
00:41:38,561 --> 00:41:39,466
What are you doing?

912
00:41:39,521 --> 00:41:40,489
I'm thinking.

913
00:41:40,657 --> 00:41:42,658
Well, think about this--
you have about ten seconds

914
00:41:42,721 --> 00:41:45,049
to peel off those shorts
and get over here

915
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:46,570
and spread a little happiness

916
00:41:46,626 --> 00:41:48,145
before the kids
start getting up.

917
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:49,761
Wow. Someone's
in a crabby mood.

918
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,561
No, let me explain
something to you.

919
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,001
Sex isn't just sex.

920
00:41:53,065 --> 00:41:54,968
Sex is good for you.

921
00:41:54,993 --> 00:41:56,847
Sex releases endorphins.

922
00:41:56,903 --> 00:41:58,518
Endorphins make you happy.

923
00:41:58,582 --> 00:41:59,712
No, I know.

924
00:42:00,111 --> 00:42:01,325
Well then,
come over here.

925
00:42:01,413 --> 00:42:02,654
All right. Fine.

926
00:42:03,094 --> 00:42:04,383
But I warned you.

927
00:42:04,526 --> 00:42:05,569
You warned me.

928
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:06,975
You made your choice.

929
00:42:07,053 --> 00:42:08,999
(laughs):
l made my choice.

930
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:10,229
I just hope you
can live with it,

931
00:42:10,276 --> 00:42:11,828
'cause there's
no going back.

932
00:42:12,852 --> 00:42:14,430
Vicious cycle.

933
00:42:14,884 --> 00:42:16,211
Got it.

934
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:24,451
