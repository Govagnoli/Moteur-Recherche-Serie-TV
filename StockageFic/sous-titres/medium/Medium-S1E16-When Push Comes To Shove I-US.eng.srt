1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,806
You holding up okay?

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:03,986
Dying of boredom yet?

3
00:00:03,986 --> 00:00:05,300
BRIDGETTE:
Nuh-uh.

4
00:00:05,895 --> 00:00:07,214
Just 15 more minutes.

5
00:00:07,214 --> 00:00:09,124
Then we'll meet Mom
and the girls by the shoe department,

6
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:10,758
and then we'll go
to the movie, okay?

7
00:00:10,758 --> 00:00:13,849
Okay, but what are
you buying socks for?

8
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:15,858
Don't you have plenty
of socks at home?

9
00:00:15,858 --> 00:00:18,130
It's not
like you're still growing.

10
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,521
Well, you know,over time, they wear out.

11
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,327
And sometimes
the dryer eats them.

12
00:00:23,327 --> 00:00:26,545
You mean we have a dryer
that eats things?

13
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:27,737
Huh?

14
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:32,933
Uh, no, no, it's just sometimes
things get lost in there.Socks mostly.

15
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,840
It's not like
it actually eats anything.

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,264
Stay here for just one second, baby.

17
00:00:38,264 --> 00:00:40,686
I just want to ask
this salesman something.

18
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:42,522
Excuse me, uh,

19
00:00:42,522 --> 00:00:44,107
I'm looking for
these in the crew.

20
00:00:44,107 --> 00:00:45,215
I'll be right over, sir.

21
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:45,986
Thank you.

22
00:00:51,057 --> 00:00:51,886
Bridgette?

23
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:54,311
Bridgette?!

24
00:00:54,692 --> 00:00:57,024
Bridgette.

25
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:00,816
Bridge?

26
00:01:02,287 --> 00:01:03,774
Bridge!

27
00:01:06,854 --> 00:01:09,570
Bridge!Bridgette Dubois?!

28
00:01:27,238 --> 00:01:30,141
ALLISON:
Hey. It's 4:00 in the morning.

29
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:31,032
What are you doing up?

30
00:01:31,032 --> 00:01:34,070
Hey. It's 4:00 in the morning.

31
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,401
What are you doing out?

32
00:01:36,374 --> 00:01:38,033
LISON:
What can I tell you.
People are terrified.

33
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:40,316
Every time
a red-headed woman who lives alone

34
00:01:40,316 --> 00:01:42,475
hears the wind jangling
a loose screen,

35
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:45,213
she thinks she's got
a close encounter with the Phoenix Phantom.

36
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:46,279
And...?

37
00:01:47,476 --> 00:01:48,625
Not tonight.

38
00:01:50,128 --> 00:01:52,866
Not the three women
that I sat with,thankfully,

39
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:56,492
although I did have the distinct honor
of watching 

40
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:59,484
the coroner pull the body
of the first victim

41
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:02,346
out of a Dumpster behind
a gentleman's club.

42
00:02:03,343 --> 00:02:04,904
Ah...

43
00:02:05,404 --> 00:02:06,479
well...

44
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:13,324
Okay, can you reset the alarm
after you get up at 6:30

45
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:14,256
for me at noon?

46
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:17,728
Absolutely. Wouldn't want to be
late making the kids breakfast,

47
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,926
getting them dressed,
taking them to school,

48
00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:23,533
making them dinner or helping them out
with their homework.

49
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:24,329
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:26,288
I'm... I know you are.

51
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:27,757
I-I'm sorry.

52
00:02:29,294 --> 00:02:30,759
People are dying.You're trying to help.

53
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,406
I get it. I do.
It's just...

54
00:02:33,303 --> 00:02:35,134
It's... it's unfair.

55
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,962
I can fix this.I swear.

56
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,315
Oh... now let's just hope

57
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:52,383
that between now and noon,

58
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:54,873
I don't have any scary dreams
that wake me up.

59
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:57,637
Well, I don't think
you need to worry
about that.

60
00:02:57,637 --> 00:03:00,375
I already did that
for you, too.

61
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:56,895
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:59,904
Mommy always puts her hand
on the top of my head so the hair doesn't pull.

63
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:01,077
Yeah, I'm sure she does.

64
00:04:01,356 --> 00:04:02,777
...was discovered
yesterday evening

65
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:04,054
in a Dumpster outside

66
00:04:04,054 --> 00:04:04,964
the Fantasy Lounge.

67
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:06,052
Bridge... hey, hey.Bridge, 

68
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:07,701
Bridge...turn that off, will you?

69
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:10,927
...apparent abduction three
nights ago of Darlene Denise.

70
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:11,792
Another redhead...

71
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:14,303
She's eating cookies.

72
00:04:14,303 --> 00:04:15,436
Nuh-uh!

73
00:04:15,436 --> 00:04:16,865
You know what? I don't care.

74
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:18,476
Everybody get their stuff
together.

75
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:19,983
Let's get this show
on the road.

76
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:21,725
Mommy's not taking us
again today?

77
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:23,294
Ariel, look around.Do you see Mommy?

78
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:27,979
Come on.
This isn't new.Mommy worked late,

79
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:29,311
so Mommy's sleeping in.

80
00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:34,258
Good night.

81
00:04:43,312 --> 00:04:44,467
WOMAN:
Must be the night shift.

82
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:45,935
He's waiting for you.

83
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:47,806
Have a nice evening.

84
00:04:47,806 --> 00:04:48,658
Are you kidding?

85
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:49,748
I'm going home
and rinsing out

86
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,328
the little bit of red
I have left in my hair.

87
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:57,955
Knock, knock.

88
00:04:57,955 --> 00:04:59,649
Tell me you had a dream.

89
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:00,662
I had a dream.

90
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:02,161
I was having dinner
with my family.

91
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:03,225
Keep dreaming.

92
00:05:03,225 --> 00:05:05,942
We had 11 calls last night
from women convinced
the Phantom

93
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:07,732
was trying to break
into their homes
or apartments

94
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:09,622
from virtually every precinct
in the city.

95
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:11,689
We've still got guys out
in the field running them down.

96
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:14,653
Allison and I interviewed
three of them ourselves.

97
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:15,367
And...?

98
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:17,595
And two of them were genuinely frightened

99
00:05:17,595 --> 00:05:18,963
although without cause.

100
00:05:19,117 --> 00:05:20,704
The other one, she just wanted

101
00:05:20,704 --> 00:05:22,368
some attention
from her boyfriend.

102
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:23,206
Uh-huh.

103
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:24,990
All together, since
the second disappearance,

104
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,496
we've had over 1,400 calls,

105
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:29,460
tips, supposed sightings,
even six confessions.

106
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:33,379
What's the "want"?
What's the "goal"?

107
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:34,896
I mean, it can't
just be about red hair.

108
00:05:34,988 --> 00:05:37,080
Whoever did it,they know how
to break and enter.

109
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,516
Places are clean as a whistle.

110
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:42,511
These abductions are planned
and extremely well-thought-out.

111
00:05:42,511 --> 00:05:43,869
They're not random.

112
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,984
Excuse me.

113
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:50,360
It's home.

114
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,833
Hello?

115
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,771
Hi, baby.

116
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,159
Just a second.

117
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,473
It's my oldest.

118
00:05:57,811 --> 00:05:58,725
Scanlon.

119
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,820
Ariel, everything okay?

120
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,234
Yeah. I was just wondering

121
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:04,234
if you knew yet.

122
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:05,574
Knew what?

123
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,038
About tomorrow.

124
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:08,711
Horseback riding.

125
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:13,622
It would just be a lot more fun
if you could go, too.

126
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:15,954
You know what?
Let me talk to my boss.

127
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:17,520
See what I can do, okay?

128
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,707
I'll call you back, baby.

129
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:19,462
Bye.

130
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:22,703
I have a problem.

131
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:25,072
I mean, I don't
mind working

132
00:06:25,072 --> 00:06:26,471
as a human lie detector,

133
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:29,293
but it's been four nights
in a row now,

134
00:06:29,293 --> 00:06:31,712
and, frankly, my family
is starting to lose it.

135
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:34,821
Is there any way I could take
a pass tonight?

136
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:37,034
We just got a call.

137
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:38,568
Apparently he's struck again.

138
00:06:45,302 --> 00:06:46,756
SCANLON:
You're awfully
quiet tonight.

139
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:49,344
Hmm. Count your blessings.

140
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:50,910
Sounds like a dare.

141
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,549
Don't mind me.

142
00:06:52,549 --> 00:06:54,365
I'm just frustrated,
that's all.

143
00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:56,706
What are you frustrated about?

144
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:57,889
That I'm here,

145
00:06:57,889 --> 00:06:59,900
that everyone's frustrated
with me.

146
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:02,279
There's nothing I can do
about it.

147
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,649
I'm guessing we're talking
about the home front, 'cause...

148
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:06,597
no around here
is frustrated with you.

149
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:09,962
Look, I'll make
you a deal.

150
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,813
Let's just check out
this crime scene.

151
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:12,946
It'll take all of half an hour.

152
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:14,727
If nothing happens for you,then we'll call it a night.

153
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:16,829
No home visits, no interviews.

154
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:18,725
You'll be back at your car
by 10:00.Home by 11:00.

155
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:19,554
How does
that sound?

156
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:21,650
That sounds fantastic.

157
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,664
God, I'm nice.

158
00:07:29,554 --> 00:07:31,055
MAN:
'Evening.

159
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:33,735
That it is.
Who have we got here?

160
00:07:33,735 --> 00:07:35,788
The mother had been calling
for two days,

161
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,332
saying she was trying
to reach her child.

162
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,757
We finally got over here.

163
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:39,960
Landlord let us in.

164
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,390
Seems to fit
the pattern.

165
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,418
The victim appears
to have been roused from sleep.

166
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:45,683
Haven't found
any blood or DNA just yet.

167
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:47,299
No signs of a struggle.

168
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:49,791
Redhead?
Of course.

169
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:50,973
Can I see
the bedroom?

170
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:52,689
SCANLON:
This is Allison Dubois.

171
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:53,639
She's with the D.A.

172
00:07:54,637 --> 00:07:56,044
Find anything?

173
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:13,843
Uh...

174
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:19,623
Well, then, it's unanimous.

175
00:08:19,623 --> 00:08:22,388
The crime scene techs found
some nothing in the kitchen.

176
00:08:22,388 --> 00:08:23,993
That led them in here

177
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:25,137
where they found
a little more nothing.

178
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,627
Now they're checking
the perimeter which,

179
00:08:27,627 --> 00:08:29,016
if everything goes
according to pattern,

180
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:30,182
will yield absolutely nothing.

181
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:32,852
Hey, honey.

182
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:34,607
Hang on a sec.

183
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:36,263
We'll be out of here in 15.

184
00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:38,323
I'll be back.

185
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:43,790
Hey, eldest child, good news.

186
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,690
Mommy's leaving work shortly,
which means...

187
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,475
I'll be going horseback riding
with you!

188
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:54,205
Yes. Tell Daddy
I should be home by 11:00.

189
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:56,836
Sure, put him on.

190
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,775
MAN:
We're looking
for Isaiah, men.

191
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:00,977
Find me Isaiah.

192
00:09:07,843 --> 00:09:09,150
Hello.

193
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,511
I think
I might've
found it.

194
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,490
I think it's on this mirror.

195
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,165
I'm sorry, sir
but I just don't see it.

196
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:19,885
<i>JOE ( over phone ):
Allison?</i>

197
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:22,331
He did it with his
finger. Come here.

198
00:09:22,331 --> 00:09:23,700
JOE:
Allison?

199
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,463
Joe, I gotta call you back.

200
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:27,863
You still don't
see it, do you?

201
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,974
Let me show you
something.

202
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:39,289
There we go.

203
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:43,656
There it is.

204
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:47,808
Isaiah 14:21.

205
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:49,994
Damn it!

206
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:52,158
I see him.

207
00:09:57,094 --> 00:09:58,600
All right.

208
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,918
SCANLON:
You still on the phone?

209
00:10:01,263 --> 00:10:04,558
Allison... you ready
to get out of here?

210
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:11,655
I think he left us a message.

211
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:12,509
Who are you talking about?

212
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:13,780
I didn't get anything
in the bedroom

213
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,247
because it didn't happen
in the bedroom.

214
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,037
It happened in here.

215
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,709
Whoa,
whoa,
whoa.

216
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:21,215
There may be evidence in there.You probably
shouldn't...

217
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:22,404
Look at the mirror.

218
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,967
What is that?

219
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:30,696
It's a message.It's a piece of scripture.

220
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:33,281
Isaiah 14:21.

221
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,709
I am not a toy.

222
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:54,794
I'm not a thing.

223
00:10:54,794 --> 00:10:56,320
You're hung up on me.

224
00:10:57,503 --> 00:10:59,314
You can't just
start kissing me

225
00:10:59,314 --> 00:11:01,144
and expect everything
to be all right.

226
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:05,995
Boy, you give up easily.

227
00:11:05,995 --> 00:11:12,571
Wow. Actually home
before midnight.

228
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,057
You talking to me, toy?

229
00:11:14,057 --> 00:11:15,682
You talking to me, thing?

230
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:17,493
Someone is very cocky.

231
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,584
Well, I cracked the case.

232
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:21,875
Caught the guy?

233
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,972
Well, I nicked the case.

234
00:11:23,972 --> 00:11:26,194
Turns out the killer
left a message

235
00:11:26,194 --> 00:11:28,066
and nobody saw it but me.

236
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,155
I'm proud of you, baby.

237
00:11:32,364 --> 00:11:33,154
Are you?

238
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:34,468
Yeah.

239
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:36,448
I'm always proud of you.

240
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:39,564
Whatever else, I am
always proud of you.

241
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,739
Want to hear something funny?

242
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:45,105
You going to start, start
calling me "toy" again, huh?

243
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,679
You know who showed
me the clue?

244
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:51,775
Who?
Captain Kenneth Push
of the Texas Rangers.

245
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:52,875
I don't get it?

246
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:53,851
What was he doing there?

247
00:11:53,851 --> 00:11:55,558
Well, that's the thing--
he wasn't there,

248
00:11:55,558 --> 00:11:57,222
It was a vision I had.

249
00:12:00,457 --> 00:12:03,705
That's right.
You've haven't met

250
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:08,550
Trust me, you have
nothing to worry about.

251
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,321
Oh, really?

252
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:12,382
Are you prepared to prove that?

253
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:13,555
Maybe.

254
00:12:13,555 --> 00:12:15,329
On your mark.

255
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:17,026
Get set...

256
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:18,379
Go!

257
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:19,256
Hey.

258
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:35,692
Mom?

259
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:40,047
Can you still ride
horses in a hurricane?

260
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:46,955
Aren't there supposed
to be two dice?

261
00:12:46,955 --> 00:12:48,807
What's the difference?
We'll just play with one dice.

262
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:50,653
I don't think that's gonna
work 'cause you have to move

263
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:52,003
at least seven paces
for the game to work.

264
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:53,821
Well, just double
whatever you roll.

265
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:55,279
Well, then you're never
gonna roll an odd number.

266
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,845
I'll just get a dice
from another game.

267
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,234
ARIEL:
You can't be
everything.

268
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:00,861
BRIDGETTE:
Can, too. Mommy said that

269
00:13:00,861 --> 00:13:02,428
I can be anything
I want to be.

270
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:04,382
She wasn't talking
about the game, stupid.

271
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:05,712
She was talking
about life.

272
00:13:05,712 --> 00:13:07,498
Games is a
part of life.

273
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:09,767
<i>Hey, admit it. Isn't this
so much more fun</i>

274
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:10,680
than horseback riding?

275
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,799
Not if I can't
be orange.

276
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,075
Okay. Girls, enough. Stop.

277
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:15,925
For the rest of today,
everyone's

278
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:17,696
going to be something
they've never been before.

279
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:18,770
What do you mean?

280
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,316
I mean... Daddy
is going to be green.

281
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:24,967
Mommy is going
to be orange,

282
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:26,937
and you girls can be
something new. Ariel.

283
00:13:26,937 --> 00:13:28,915
You're going
to be yellow.

284
00:13:28,915 --> 00:13:30,539
Bridgette,
you're blue.

285
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:32,824
Blue? Blue is
a boy's color.

286
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:34,802
Here we go...

287
00:13:37,012 --> 00:13:38,202
Hold on a second.

288
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:42,362
ALLISON:
Hello?

289
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:44,439
Captain Push,
you got my message.

290
00:13:46,052 --> 00:13:48,668
One second.

291
00:13:48,668 --> 00:13:50,493
Since I saw you,

292
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:51,610
I've been doing a lot of work

293
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,176
for the local
district attorney's office.

294
00:13:53,176 --> 00:13:55,709
Some pretty
interesting stuff, really,

295
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,587
which is what
I'm calling you about.

296
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,184
This is gonna sound
kind of strange,

297
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:04,536
but if I say to you,
"Isaiah 14:21,"

298
00:14:04,536 --> 00:14:05,679
does that ring any bells?

299
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,975
Good news.

300
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,698
What's the good news?

301
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:16,145
Hey, I thought
we were gonna play a game?

302
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:18,950
Yeah, that was an hour
and 20 minutes ago.

303
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:22,611
I-I'm sorry.

304
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,049
I just, I...

305
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:29,515
<i>It turns out there is
a connection.</i>

306
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:31,006
A killer with
the same M.O.

307
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:32,523
made his way
across South Texas

308
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:34,453
a couple of years ago,
so I called Devalos.

309
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:35,828
The three of us conferenced.

310
00:14:35,828 --> 00:14:38,588
He's flying out
to meet us tomorrow.

311
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,918
Sunday?

312
00:14:44,107 --> 00:14:46,759
Miss Dubois.

313
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:58,122
In April of 2002, the state
comptroller called me up.

314
00:14:58,122 --> 00:15:01,804
His sister's 19-year-old
daughter was going to school

315
00:15:01,804 --> 00:15:04,164
in Austin and she hadn't
called home in over a week.

316
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:06,866
So I went down there
to take a look.

317
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:09,497
I was about half certain
she was in Corpus or Cabo

318
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:13,853
or Daytona, one of these
spring break towns where they stop

319
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:16,636
 serving you beer
if they find out you been calling your folks.

320
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:20,119
Three days later,

321
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:24,178
we found her body behind
a massage parlor off the I-10.

322
00:15:24,178 --> 00:15:28,029
Over the next 11 days,
there were two more kids

323
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:29,363
reported missing--

324
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:32,203
a 20-year-old Galveston woman

325
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:34,876
and an 18-year-old
fellow from Houston.

326
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:37,335
Sorry. Did you
say one of your
victims was male?

327
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:39,571
Yes, sir.

328
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,509
Was he by any chance a redhead?

329
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:44,299
None of them had red hair.

330
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:48,918
Huh. Well, now
I'm starting to wonder

331
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:50,382
if we're all talking
about the same perpetrator.

332
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,582
Our profilers
seem fairly sure that what we're

333
00:15:52,582 --> 00:15:54,994
dealing with here in Arizona is some kind
of sex killer

334
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:57,452
who is only interested
in redheaded women.

335
00:16:00,616 --> 00:16:03,626
You just have the one
girl so far, right?

336
00:16:03,626 --> 00:16:05,033
One body?

337
00:16:06,246 --> 00:16:07,503
Either of you see her?

338
00:16:07,503 --> 00:16:09,232
Detective Scanlon
and I did.

339
00:16:09,232 --> 00:16:11,016
We watched the coroner fish the body out

340
00:16:11,016 --> 00:16:12,508
of a Dumpster the other night.

341
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:14,039
And?

342
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,353
And it looked like she'd
been stabbed, or worse.

343
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:18,356
She was covered with blood.

344
00:16:19,099 --> 00:16:20,954
Any autopsy results yet?

345
00:16:20,954 --> 00:16:22,442
Due in first thing tomorrow.

346
00:16:22,442 --> 00:16:24,657
PUSH:
Well, let me tell you
what they're going to say.

347
00:16:24,657 --> 00:16:27,019
The girl's going
to be clean as a whistle.

348
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,226
No signs of
sexual violation whatsoever.

349
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,895
She will, however,

350
00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:35,793
be missing her heart.

351
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:37,230
SCANLON:
Excuse me?

352
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,378
He takes their hearts.

353
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,625
Carves it right
out of their chest.

354
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:49,017
Doesn't have anything
to do with sex.

355
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:51,127
It's Biblical.

356
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:55,741
Isaiah. Chapter 14, verse 21.

357
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:58,670
"Prepare slaughter
for their children

358
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,697
"for the iniquity "of their fathers;

359
00:17:00,697 --> 00:17:04,196
that they do not "rise, nor
possess the land,

360
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:06,145
nor fill the face
of the world."

361
00:17:06,145 --> 00:17:09,460
Every time we'd find a body,
there it'd be.

362
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,467
Every time we'd
go to a residence

363
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:13,751
or someone was reported missing.

364
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:14,457
SCANLON:
Wait a second.

365
00:17:14,457 --> 00:17:15,857
Let's not jump
the gun here.

366
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:17,456
This Isaiah thing
was on a mirror

367
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:18,590
the other night.
That's the only time.

368
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,293
Excuse me.

369
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:21,381
When you found that body,

370
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:23,006
did you look in the Dumpster?

371
00:17:26,802 --> 00:17:29,035
Well, look
in the Dumpster again.

372
00:17:29,035 --> 00:17:31,006
Look all around the Dumpster.

373
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:33,081
<i>Look under
the Dumpster.</i>

374
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:36,271
I'm betting you,it's there. It's the guy's M.O.

375
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:39,112
It's like writing
in the mist on a mirror

376
00:17:39,112 --> 00:17:41,547
where you might
not see it.

377
00:17:41,547 --> 00:17:43,671
This guy wants you
to have to

378
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:46,424
look for it. He wants you to
have to work for it.

379
00:17:46,585 --> 00:17:48,141
You're a philistine.

380
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:50,256
We're all philistines.

381
00:17:50,256 --> 00:17:52,488
I still think it's possible
we're talking about another guy,

382
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,360
a copycat.

383
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,241
It's possible... but I doubt it.

384
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:59,935
We never went public
with the quotes.

385
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,222
Didn't want to

386
00:18:02,222 --> 00:18:04,367
encourage him.

387
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:06,431
Okay, so where does
this leave us?

388
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:08,625
A quotation
from the Bible about children

389
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,793
being killed
for the sins of their fathers.

390
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:11,761
I'm not sure I get it.

391
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:13,184
Well, don't feel bad.

392
00:18:13,184 --> 00:18:14,441
I didn't get it either.

393
00:18:15,263 --> 00:18:17,683
11 days, three kids,
and then...

394
00:18:17,683 --> 00:18:18,641
it stopped.

395
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:21,377
Like a... storm.

396
00:18:21,377 --> 00:18:22,934
Just-- pff!-- gone.

397
00:18:25,096 --> 00:18:27,050
I figured
he's dead.

398
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:31,462
Apparently I figured wrong.

399
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:38,073
This is completely
unnecessary, you know.

400
00:18:38,073 --> 00:18:41,115
Takeout rotisserie
chicken and sides

401
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:43,158
served on dinner plates
with three kids fighting

402
00:18:43,158 --> 00:18:45,630
over the wishbone?
This is something you're willing
to pass up?

403
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:49,391
All right. This one time.

404
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:53,735
So how's your heart?

405
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:57,984
It's happy
to be here.

406
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:02,058
<i>JOE:
Well, I finally met the amazing</i>

407
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:02,875
Captain Push.

408
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:03,576
And?

409
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,380
I thought he'd be taller.

410
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,623
Ooh. Someone's
in a mood.

411
00:19:07,623 --> 00:19:10,091
What are you
talking about?It's 6:30 on Sunday night.

412
00:19:10,091 --> 00:19:11,873
I've spent all day
entertaining the kids

413
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:13,961
and w I'm spending all night
entertaining a surprise guest.

414
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:15,222
Why would I be in a mood?

415
00:19:16,641 --> 00:19:18,470
<i>BRIDGETTE:
And I rode Whisper.</i>

416
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:22,019
And I rode Lightning,
and Daddy and Marie rode...

417
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:23,241
Old Glue.

418
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:24,444
Old Glue?

419
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:26,226
He was very...

420
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:27,389
very gentle.

421
00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:28,989
<i>Mommy, it was
so much fun.</i>

422
00:19:28,989 --> 00:19:31,865
I know. Daddy said
it was the most fun ever.

423
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:33,889
The only thing that would
make it funner

424
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:36,685
was if we had
our own ponies.

425
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:37,866
ALLISON:
Excuse me?

426
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:39,324
Who gave you that idea?

427
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:41,777
Danielle Moynihan
She has her own pony.

428
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:43,518
We saw her riding it
when we left the stable.

429
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:46,319
Ladies, we
have a guest.

430
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,737
Now's not the time
to be discussing...

431
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:49,434
I had a pony growing up.

432
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:50,851
You did?

433
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:52,049
What was his name?

434
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:54,114
Jacinto.

435
00:19:55,014 --> 00:19:57,017
He was named after a great battle.

436
00:19:57,017 --> 00:19:58,977
Why? Was he mean?

437
00:19:58,977 --> 00:20:00,435
No.

438
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:03,961
He sure did make a mess, though.

439
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:05,227
ARIEL:
A mess?

440
00:20:06,034 --> 00:20:07,410
How?

441
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,919
Well, you know how
when you have a cat,

442
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,886
you have to clean up
his litter box?

443
00:20:12,886 --> 00:20:14,855
Well, you imagine

444
00:20:14,855 --> 00:20:16,423
doing that for
something so big,

445
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:20,196
he leaves behind
six or seven shoe boxes

446
00:20:20,196 --> 00:20:22,291
full of manure every day.

447
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:25,231
Only it's not
in shoe boxes

448
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:27,048
You got to
shovel it.

449
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:29,870
Every morning, every night.

450
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,694
Every morning and every night?!

451
00:20:32,694 --> 00:20:35,372
Plus you got to feed
him twice a day.

452
00:20:35,372 --> 00:20:38,558
12 gallons of water,
half a bale of hay.

453
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:41,653
You gotta pick up
his hooves, check them

454
00:20:41,653 --> 00:20:44,974
for thrush. You gotta stay
with him when he's sick.

455
00:20:44,974 --> 00:20:47,731
Do horses get sick a lot?

456
00:20:47,731 --> 00:20:50,886
Well, my horse got very sick at the end.

457
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,972
He had colic.

458
00:20:53,972 --> 00:20:55,840
Bad.

459
00:20:57,096 --> 00:20:59,509
I had colic.

460
00:21:00,813 --> 00:21:03,541
We had to take tube

461
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,540
and run it down his nose

462
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,146
and pump oil
through it

463
00:21:08,146 --> 00:21:10,576
to try to get his
belly to loosen up.

464
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:17,974
Unfortunately...it didn't do the trick.

465
00:21:20,137 --> 00:21:21,546
He died.

466
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:27,312
Does anyone feel like dessert?

467
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:28,452
Oh, yeah.

468
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:30,262
Okay, girls, come help
me with dessert.

469
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,954
Thanks.

470
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:37,470
All right, he did get
taller as the night went on.

471
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,286
You like him. I know you do.

472
00:21:39,286 --> 00:21:40,566
All right, I liked him.

473
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,167
I'm gonna tell him
tomorrow when I take him

474
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,919
to the airport.* I'm gonna
tell him. *

475
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,043
Okay, you do that.

476
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:50,733
And now that's
out of the way,

477
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:52,465
what do you say we
call a moratorium

478
00:21:52,465 --> 00:21:56,192
on all things, topics
and people work-related,

479
00:21:56,192 --> 00:21:58,665
just for the next
nine hours or so, huh?

480
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:00,564
Would that make
you happy, toy?

481
00:22:00,564 --> 00:22:03,159
Would that make you
happy, thing?

482
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:04,843
Shut up.

483
00:22:09,976 --> 00:22:11,605
PUSH:
Ms. Dubois?

484
00:22:12,271 --> 00:22:15,538
Ms. Dubois, wake up.

485
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:17,396
Ms. Dubois.

486
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,182
As soon as it happened
I had to tell you.

487
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:22,690
As soon as it happened
I had to let you know.

488
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,298
You were right.
You were right all along.

489
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:26,183
What are you talking about?

490
00:22:26,183 --> 00:22:27,767
Oh, my God,
what are you doing here?

491
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:30,540
First thing that hits you is
everything you know.

492
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,841
Everything.
Your whole dang life.

493
00:22:33,841 --> 00:22:35,016
It hits you like a wave.

494
00:22:35,016 --> 00:22:37,576
Takes a second,
but you see it all,

495
00:22:37,576 --> 00:22:39,731
feel it all, too-- the...

496
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:42,323
sadness, the exultation.

497
00:22:42,323 --> 00:22:44,624
It's all in there,
and it's not even a second.

498
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:47,382
And then, the second wave is
everything you don't know.

499
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:49,892
Everything you ever
wondered about.

500
00:22:49,892 --> 00:22:50,995
Everything.

501
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,121
(whispering):
Captain Push...

502
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,889
my husband, it-it's 3:30
in the morning.
You're just...

503
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:57,026
annihilated with
extraordinary clarity.

504
00:22:57,026 --> 00:22:59,907
I mean, I see it all from here.
I see everything.

505
00:22:59,907 --> 00:23:00,918
Allison...

506
00:23:00,918 --> 00:23:03,720
they're related.
What's related?

507
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,677
The murders, the victims,
the ones he chooses.

508
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:07,333
It's not random.

509
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,516
Okay...
And there's
another girl.

510
00:23:09,516 --> 00:23:11,665
She's next on his list.

511
00:23:11,665 --> 00:23:13,280
Her name is...

512
00:23:24,722 --> 00:23:26,423
I'll get the baby.

513
00:23:26,423 --> 00:23:27,804
You wake the girls.

514
00:23:36,524 --> 00:23:38,108
Good morning, ma'am.
Morning.

515
00:23:38,108 --> 00:23:40,909
I was wondering if you could
ring up Kenneth Push's room

516
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:42,776
and let him know that
his ride's in the lobby?
Certainly.

517
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:49,828
You haven't by chance
spoken with Mr. Push

518
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,031
or any members
of his family this
morning, have you?

519
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:52,597
What?

520
00:23:53,614 --> 00:23:55,348
I don't really have
all the details.

521
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:57,379
All I know is that
they called an ambulance

522
00:23:57,379 --> 00:23:59,476
for Mr. Push sometime
after 3:00 this morning.

523
00:23:59,476 --> 00:24:01,436
They took him over to
St. Christopher's Hospital.

524
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,726
Now, look, Captain
Push, I appreciate
you're far from home

525
00:24:07,801 --> 00:24:09,992
but these temporary
pacemakers are
only designed

526
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:11,625
to work three or
four days at a time

527
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,879
before a permanent
unit can be placed
inside the body.

528
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:16,378
It's a pretty straightforward
procedure.

529
00:24:16,378 --> 00:24:18,600
I wish you would reconsider
and let me do it.

530
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,324
Doctor...

531
00:24:20,324 --> 00:24:22,920
this is the first time
you and I have met, right?

532
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,139
No offense, but...
I'm not in the habit

533
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:29,548
of letting a perfect stranger
slice me up the middle

534
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:34,128
and install miniature
electronics in my chest.

535
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:38,723
Now, I have a wonderful doctor
back home

536
00:24:38,723 --> 00:24:42,628
who knows me inside and out,
and in a day and a half,

537
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:45,981
when you let me out of this bed,
I'm flying back to Texas,

538
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:48,569
and I'll have him do
whatever is necessary.

539
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:50,237
ALLISON:
You causing trouble?

540
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:51,638
Uh-huh.

541
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,188
You Mrs. Dubois?

542
00:24:58,188 --> 00:25:00,301
Yup. I'm the woman
who fed him

543
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:01,777
whatever it is that
put him in here.

544
00:25:01,777 --> 00:25:05,227
DOCTOR:
Well, maybe you can convince him
to let me operate,

545
00:25:05,227 --> 00:25:07,017
put in that pacemaker
so he can go back home.

546
00:25:07,017 --> 00:25:09,324
I'm fine.

547
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:12,619
I got this outboard model
right here.

548
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:15,557
Tells my heart when to beat,

549
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,636
holds all my addresses
and phone numbers.

550
00:25:17,636 --> 00:25:19,847
I even get AM/FM radio.

551
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:20,697
DOCTOR:
Yeah.

552
00:25:20,697 --> 00:25:23,719
Well, I'm gonna go ahead
and call your doctor in Houston,

553
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:27,064
see if he can't convince you.Mrs. Dubois.

554
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:31,633
(muttering):
He's gonna phone my doctor in Houston...

555
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:33,160
Oh, boy.

556
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:36,923
I let you out of my
sight for 20 minutes.

557
00:25:36,923 --> 00:25:39,410
I don't know
what to tell you.

558
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,086
Woke up in the middle
of the night.

559
00:25:42,086 --> 00:25:44,066
Recognized the feeling.

560
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:47,074
Knew exactly
what was happening.

561
00:25:47,074 --> 00:25:49,700
Called downstairs
to the desk

562
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,964
and must have...
blacked out right after that.

563
00:25:52,964 --> 00:25:56,700
Next thing I know,
they're working on an ambulance.

564
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,846
I'm guessing this
was around 3:30
in the morning.

565
00:25:59,846 --> 00:26:02,386
Yeah. I don't know.

566
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:03,758
You were wearing
blue boxers

567
00:26:03,758 --> 00:26:05,146
and a white T-shirt.

568
00:26:06,693 --> 00:26:09,445
You gonna guess
my weight now?

569
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:12,680
I think you came to see me
last night.

570
00:26:14,163 --> 00:26:15,348
Come again?

571
00:26:15,653 --> 00:26:18,139
You came to visit me,
in my bedroom.

572
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:19,557
It was around 3:30
in the morning.

573
00:26:19,557 --> 00:26:20,876
I thought that I was dreaming.

574
00:26:20,876 --> 00:26:23,090
I didn't know
what was happening.

575
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,186
But now I realize...

576
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:26,383
it was you.

577
00:26:29,914 --> 00:26:32,337
You must have died
for a minute or two.

578
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,197
I know you have a
difficult time with
this kind of thing.

579
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:41,397
<i>( quietly ):
I don't know what to say.</i>

580
00:26:43,296 --> 00:26:46,443
Showed up in my boxers, huh?

581
00:26:46,443 --> 00:26:48,793
Hope I didn't offend

582
00:26:48,793 --> 00:26:50,359
<i>the other guests.
( laughs )</i>

583
00:26:51,623 --> 00:26:55,527
You said that where you were,
you could see everything,

584
00:26:55,527 --> 00:26:58,040
that you had
this enormous clarity.

585
00:26:59,106 --> 00:27:00,405
Allison...

586
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:02,511
You were very excited--
you told me that

587
00:27:02,511 --> 00:27:04,154
all the murders were related.

588
00:27:04,154 --> 00:27:07,370
That the victims
weren't random.

589
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,850
Not random, huh?

590
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,817
That hardly seems
like a revelation

591
00:27:12,817 --> 00:27:15,246
worthy of a near-death
experience.

592
00:27:15,246 --> 00:27:18,397
And then you said you knew
who the next victim would be.

593
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:21,978
And...?

594
00:27:21,978 --> 00:27:23,367
And...

595
00:27:25,892 --> 00:27:28,130
I guess that's when
they brought you back to life.

596
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,511
You never said
their name.

597
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:32,399
You just disappeared.

598
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,995
Or I fell asleep, or...

599
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,457
I know you well enough to know

600
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,222
that you wouldn't be
telling me these things

601
00:27:41,222 --> 00:27:43,343
if you didn't believe them
with all your heart.

602
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:47,771
Captain Push...
I have
no recollection

603
00:27:47,771 --> 00:27:50,684
of seeing anyone last night

604
00:27:50,684 --> 00:27:53,535
except a very frightened
hotel manager

605
00:27:53,535 --> 00:27:56,864
and a couple very able EMS guys

606
00:27:56,864 --> 00:28:01,206
whose names I don't remember
and who probably saved my life.

607
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:04,524
Allison...

608
00:28:04,524 --> 00:28:07,415
I'm a lawman.

609
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:11,618
This maniac

610
00:28:11,618 --> 00:28:13,782
killed three Texans.

611
00:28:13,782 --> 00:28:15,321
Don't you think

612
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:16,614
I'd tell you if I knew

613
00:28:16,614 --> 00:28:18,277
what tied all these people
together?

614
00:28:18,277 --> 00:28:20,560
Don't you think I'd tell you

615
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,876
if I knew who he was fixin'
to kill next?

616
00:28:23,876 --> 00:28:25,857
Of course.

617
00:28:27,522 --> 00:28:29,149
Related? How?

618
00:28:29,206 --> 00:28:30,688
You're not giving me
much to work with.

619
00:28:30,688 --> 00:28:32,732
I don't know,
they're just related.

620
00:28:32,732 --> 00:28:35,211
And you came upon this
startling revelation how?

621
00:28:35,954 --> 00:28:37,716
It's not important.

622
00:28:43,316 --> 00:28:45,802
It's Detective
Scanlon. Damn.

623
00:28:45,802 --> 00:28:48,398
It's 2:40. You'll
wake the baby.

624
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:49,785
Just click it
and hang up.

625
00:28:53,845 --> 00:28:54,782
<i>( over phone ):
Allison...</i>

626
00:28:54,782 --> 00:28:56,258
All right, talk to him.

627
00:28:56,258 --> 00:28:57,558
I'll get the baby.
Hello?

628
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:00,379
No, it's okay, he understands.
What's going on?

629
00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:02,636
We found the bodies
of Darlene Denise

630
00:29:02,636 --> 00:29:04,191
and, uh, Katie Fisher.

631
00:29:04,191 --> 00:29:06,032
Okay, where did he leave them?

632
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:09,431
A church. Downtown.

633
00:29:09,431 --> 00:29:11,637
Right in the middle
of Metro district.

634
00:29:11,637 --> 00:29:14,515
Wait a second,
does that fit the pattern?

635
00:29:14,515 --> 00:29:16,241
Well, it's not a nudie bar

636
00:29:16,241 --> 00:29:17,504
and it's not an abortion clinic,

637
00:29:17,504 --> 00:29:19,327
but it's kind of
a nontraditional church.

638
00:29:20,263 --> 00:29:21,457
Female priest.

639
00:29:21,457 --> 00:29:24,555
Gay choir. I mean,
if you're the kind of killer

640
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:25,974
who likes fire
with his brimstone,

641
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,834
it's probably the kind of place
that would tick you off.

642
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,369
What about Isaiah?

643
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:32,311
He's here--
every prayerbook in every pew,

644
00:29:32,311 --> 00:29:33,925
there's a bookmark
so you open right to it.

645
00:29:35,157 --> 00:29:37,075
<i>So, you want to come down?
( Marie crying )</i>

646
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,984
I can send a car for you.

647
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:40,995
It's up to you.

648
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:43,114
I just thought y you might want
to come down here and,

649
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,123
uh...commune.

650
00:29:46,942 --> 00:29:48,031
You know what?

651
00:29:48,031 --> 00:29:50,234
Let's talk tomorrow.
I'll give you a call.

652
00:29:50,234 --> 00:29:52,397
All right. Absolutely.

653
00:29:52,397 --> 00:29:53,864
'Kay, thanks.

654
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,857
Is it anything
important?

655
00:29:56,857 --> 00:29:58,117
Nah.

656
00:29:58,117 --> 00:29:59,992
Shh... sweetheart.

657
00:30:01,462 --> 00:30:03,781
You're making
the right decision.

658
00:30:03,781 --> 00:30:05,524
Don't gloat.

659
00:30:06,275 --> 00:30:07,988
<i>I'm not making any decision.</i>

660
00:30:07,988 --> 00:30:10,889
You brain-washed
my doctor back home.

661
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:19,133
Captain Push here.

662
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:21,005
Allison Dubois here.

663
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:25,321
Well, you're in
an awfully good mood.

664
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:28,405
I'll bet that's 'cause
you're not surrounded

665
00:30:28,405 --> 00:30:31,921
by people hell-bent on playing with your innards.

666
00:30:31,921 --> 00:30:34,109
No. But I am staring
at my little baby

667
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:36,461
who has a bit of a fever--
which is why I'm calling.

668
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:39,793
I really wanted to stop by and
see you today before you left,

669
00:30:39,793 --> 00:30:41,591
but I just don't know
how I'm gonna do it.

670
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:45,970
Well, then I have some good news
and I have some bad news.

671
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:49,752
The good news is,
I'm not leaving quite so fast.

672
00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:53,913
The bad news is,
they're opening up my chest tomorrow morning,

673
00:30:53,913 --> 00:30:57,388
and I may not feel too much
like entertaining after that.

674
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:58,905
Oh, no.

675
00:30:58,905 --> 00:31:00,860
Well, maybe I could swing by

676
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,790
and see you after
my husband gets home.

677
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:08,462
Hell, I'll have them dress me
in some fresh gauze

678
00:31:08,462 --> 00:31:09,901
if I know you're coming.

679
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,176
<i>( laughs softly ):
It's a deal.</i>

680
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:17,010
Captain Push, forgive me,
I'm getting another call.

681
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,910
Give me a second,
I'll get rid of 'em.

682
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:21,201
Hello?

683
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:22,947
DEVALOS:
Allison.

684
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,047
Good afternoon, sir.

685
00:31:25,047 --> 00:31:26,401
I have somebody
on the other line.

686
00:31:26,401 --> 00:31:27,697
Let me just...
That's all right,

687
00:31:27,697 --> 00:31:28,879
this'll just take a moment.

688
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:30,926
Now that we have two bodies,

689
00:31:30,926 --> 00:31:32,541
and based
on our conversation yesterday,

690
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:35,117
I took a flier and ordered up
some comparative DNA.

691
00:31:35,117 --> 00:31:36,530
Now, I just received

692
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,859
the first report
about 20 minutes ago, and...

693
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:41,787
<i>( sighs ):
Allison, these two women
are related.</i>

694
00:31:44,574 --> 00:31:45,901
Excuse me?

695
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:47,971
I haven't figured out how
quite yet,

696
00:31:47,971 --> 00:31:50,212
but according
to their DNA markers,

697
00:31:50,212 --> 00:31:52,615
both women have the same father.

698
00:31:53,752 --> 00:31:56,417
<i>Allison?
( sighs )</i>

699
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:59,344
I-I'm sorry, I just, uh...

700
00:31:59,344 --> 00:32:01,151
Just thought you'd want to know.

701
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:02,930
Bye.
Thank you.

702
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,909
Hello? Are you still there?

703
00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:06,906
That is not the kind of thing

704
00:32:06,906 --> 00:32:09,323
you want to be asking
a man in my condition.

705
00:32:10,358 --> 00:32:13,593
Okay, I hear no laughter.

706
00:32:13,593 --> 00:32:15,200
You all right?

707
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,669
Yeah. N-No. I just...
That was the office--

708
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:21,402
they ran some comparative DNA
on our first two victims.

709
00:32:21,402 --> 00:32:24,754
They don't understand how,
but according to the lab,

710
00:32:24,754 --> 00:32:26,948
both of these women
are actually related.

711
00:32:26,948 --> 00:32:30,652
From a genetic standpoint,
they have the same father.

712
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:35,829
Captain Push?

713
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:24,935
Hey, everybody.

714
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:33,905
Hi., Daddy.

715
00:33:33,905 --> 00:33:37,129
Wow, Daddy, who's that for?

716
00:33:38,207 --> 00:33:40,459
The balloon is for Marie,
the wine's for Mommy and me.

717
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:41,642
Where's everyone?

718
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,185
Marie's sleeping
and Mom's getting dressed.

719
00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:50,556
Hey.

720
00:33:50,556 --> 00:33:53,909
Thank God. I was hoping you'd
show up about 15 minutes ago.

721
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:56,141
I stopped to pick up
a couple of things.

722
00:33:56,141 --> 00:33:58,098
Are you going somewhere?

723
00:33:58,098 --> 00:33:59,181
Don't be mad.

724
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:01,679
The Phoenix Phantom snatched
another girl.

725
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,594
Devalos called. He asked me
to stop by the crime scene.

726
00:34:04,594 --> 00:34:06,179
I've been waiting
for you to get home.

727
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:07,862
I have to stick my head in
at the hospital.

728
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:09,103
Say hi to Captain Push.

729
00:34:09,103 --> 00:34:10,954
Turns out they're
operating on
him tomorrow

730
00:34:10,954 --> 00:34:11,972
I feel badly--

731
00:34:11,972 --> 00:34:12,998
he's in a strange city.

732
00:34:12,998 --> 00:34:14,504
He doesn't know anybody.

733
00:34:14,504 --> 00:34:18,208
Marie's fever broke hours ago.

734
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:19,311
She's out like a light.

735
00:34:20,348 --> 00:34:22,603
There's meat loaf in the oven.

736
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:23,983
It'll be ready in 15 minutes.

737
00:34:23,983 --> 00:34:25,117
There's coleslaw
in the fridge.

738
00:34:25,117 --> 00:34:27,121
So, if I leave
right now

739
00:34:27,121 --> 00:34:29,334
I have a chance
of getting back by 9:30.

740
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:31,862
You still proud of me?

741
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,622
BRIDGETTE:
Look what
Daddy brought.

742
00:34:37,347 --> 00:34:40,407
Isn't Marie a little young
for this?

743
00:34:40,407 --> 00:34:41,913
Get out of here.

744
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,066
We'll have this fight at 9:30.

745
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:45,053
You promise?

746
00:34:45,053 --> 00:34:47,481
I'm uncorking that at 9:15.

747
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:49,004
Shall we synchronize
our watches?

748
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,186
Just go.

749
00:35:16,779 --> 00:35:17,971
PUSH:
Hey.

750
00:35:17,971 --> 00:35:19,786
Hey.

751
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:22,485
How long you been sitting there?

752
00:35:23,952 --> 00:35:25,262
A bit.

753
00:35:26,797 --> 00:35:29,364
They told me they gave you
a little something

754
00:35:29,364 --> 00:35:31,208
to help take the edge off.

755
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:35,534
Is that what they call it,
an edge?

756
00:35:37,707 --> 00:35:39,491
For what it's worth,

757
00:35:39,491 --> 00:35:42,998
apparently this is a fairly
run-of-the-mill operation.

758
00:35:42,998 --> 00:35:44,800
It's not about my heart.

759
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:51,390
I could have stopped this thing.

760
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,306
You don't know that.

761
00:35:53,306 --> 00:35:57,239
Yeah, I do.

762
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:02,582
Called Texas right after
you and I got off the phone.

763
00:36:03,806 --> 00:36:05,921
Had them pull out
the old lab work.

764
00:36:05,921 --> 00:36:09,172
It was there all along.

765
00:36:09,172 --> 00:36:10,807
Just never
looked for it.

766
00:36:12,107 --> 00:36:13,721
You told me.

767
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:16,857
You said, they're related--

768
00:36:16,857 --> 00:36:19,013
and they were.

769
00:36:19,013 --> 00:36:22,681
No, Captain Push.
You told me.

770
00:36:24,398 --> 00:36:28,332
I can't remember
the person's name.

771
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:32,510
I've been thinking...

772
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:35,452
I've been trying all day.

773
00:36:35,452 --> 00:36:37,764
The next victim.

774
00:36:37,764 --> 00:36:41,538
You told me I...
I tried to tell you.

775
00:36:44,574 --> 00:36:47,053
What time is it?

776
00:36:47,053 --> 00:36:49,599
I lost all track of time.

777
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,264
It's 10:15.

778
00:36:59,664 --> 00:37:01,260
He got her today.

779
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,540
I just came
from the crime scene.

780
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,392
Her name was Sarah Duffy.

781
00:37:12,904 --> 00:37:16,013
I'm sorry.

782
00:37:18,491 --> 00:37:21,636
That... God...

783
00:37:21,636 --> 00:37:26,161
He is one perverse entity.

784
00:37:27,895 --> 00:37:30,628
First you die...

785
00:37:30,628 --> 00:37:32,871
then you see everything.

786
00:37:33,945 --> 00:37:36,750
WOMAN:
I'm sorry,visiting hours are over.

787
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,988
<i>And you need your rest.</i>

788
00:37:38,988 --> 00:37:40,464
You have a big
day tomorrow.

789
00:37:40,464 --> 00:37:42,082
We're coming
for you at 5:30.

790
00:37:42,082 --> 00:37:43,855
Duly noted.

791
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:47,750
Oh, by the way...

792
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:52,548
could you bring me a comb
and a pair of nail clippers?

793
00:37:56,553 --> 00:38:00,042
I want you
to do something for me.

794
00:38:01,705 --> 00:38:04,457
I want you to forget
about all this.

795
00:38:05,954 --> 00:38:08,867
I want you
to concentrate on getting better.

796
00:38:24,985 --> 00:38:29,101
I want to come by,
check on you tomorrow.

797
00:38:56,698 --> 00:38:58,151
<i>( whispering ):
Hey, it's me.</i>

798
00:38:58,151 --> 00:39:00,838
I'm sorry I'm late.

799
00:39:02,324 --> 00:39:04,234
I would have called,

800
00:39:04,234 --> 00:39:06,829
but they don't allow cell phones
in the cardio unit.

801
00:39:09,102 --> 00:39:13,015
So... how'd it go
with the kids?

802
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:49,643
Joe...

803
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:59,434
Are you really asleep?

804
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,809
i'm sorry

805
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:53,700
Hello.

806
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,130
Allison...

807
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:57,413
Captain Push.

808
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,294
I just called

809
00:40:59,294 --> 00:41:02,406
to make sure you made it home.

810
00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:04,916
That you're safe.

811
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:07,892
That you're in your bed.

812
00:41:07,892 --> 00:41:10,451
I'm home.

813
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:13,823
I'm safe... in my bed.

814
00:41:13,823 --> 00:41:15,961
Good.

815
00:41:15,961 --> 00:41:18,881
Okay, then.

816
00:41:18,881 --> 00:41:21,173
Let's get some rest.

817
00:41:21,173 --> 00:41:24,074
And I'll see you soon, okay?

818
00:41:24,074 --> 00:41:27,475
Not if I don't see you first.

819
00:41:27,475 --> 00:41:29,552
Okay?

820
00:41:29,552 --> 00:41:31,985
<i>( chuckles ):
Okay.</i>

821
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:36,144
Bye.
