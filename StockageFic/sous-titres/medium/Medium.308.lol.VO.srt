Come here.

What are you doing?

00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,300
What if I'm contagious?

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Shh...

Oh, baby!

Oh, baby, let me have it.
Let me have all of it.

Oh, you okay?

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,500
I don't know.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,400
What were you dreaming?

29
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,900
Huh? I wasn't
dreaming anything.

30
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,200
I was sleeping.

31
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,100
It w nice.

32
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,200
Sorry.

Oh, you're kidding!

Help!

Please!

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,500
Somebody, anybody!

00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,000
JOE:
Allison?
(gasps)

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
You okay?

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm fine. I'm just trying
to take a shower.

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, you got
to turn on the
water first.

43
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,900

00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,700
Allison, you
doing anything?

46
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,800
Are you familiar with State
Assemblyman Henry Rykoff?

47
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,600
I know he's a
state assemblyman.

48
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,300
I know his first name
is Henry.

49
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,300
Died in his sleep
last night.

50
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,200
Apparently, his widow
is fiercely protective

51
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,900
of her late husband's legacy.

52
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,300
Okay.

53
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,900
After she discovered
the assemblyman had passed,

54
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,600
she called EMS.

55
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,900
I don't know what's
going on over there,

56
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,600
but Emergency Medical
called the police

57
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,700
and everyone's been there

58
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,300
since before 7:00
this morning.

59
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,100
It's past 10:00.

60
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,400
What do you think's
going on?

61
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
I have no idea.

62
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,400
But whatever it is,
the governor asked me

63
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,200
to get over there
and make it go away.

64
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,600
What am I doing?

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,800
Oh, I don't know.

66
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,800
The assemblyman died.
Isn't that your area?

67
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Mrs. Rykoff,

68
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,300
I'm District Attorney
Manuel Devalos.

69
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,600
This is Allison Dubois.

70
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,700
She's a bereavement
counselor who works
with my office.

71
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,100
I'm so sorry for your loss.

72
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,500
The governor asked us
to come by

73
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,800
and see if we could
be of any help

74
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,800
during what he knows must be
a very difficult time for you.

75
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,400
Help? Absolutely,
we could use some help.

76
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,900
Those idiots with the ambulance
called the police,

77
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,200
and the police won't let me
call a funeral home.

78
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,700
My husband is lying dead
in his bed.

79
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,100
He's been there for hours.

80
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,200
I would like to get him
where he belongs,

81
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,100
so we can move on with
the business of his funeral.

82
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,100
I understand.

83
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,900
Mr. District Attorney,

84
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,000
my name is Casey Frank.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,700
I was the assemblyman's chief
of staff, also a family friend.

86
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,600
This is Scott Brittenham,

87
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,800
the family attorney.

88
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,800
Apparently, the maid
discovered the body

89
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,300
and immediately dialed 911

90
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,800
before Mrs. Rykoff here had
a chance to make contact

91
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,900
with the funeral home.

92
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,900
I think you'll see

93
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,900
it's all a big
misunderstanding.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,800
All anyone wants really, is to protect
the assemblyman's dignity.

95
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,900
Of course.

96
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Let us see what we
can find out, please.

97
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,300
Excuse us.

98
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,500
MAN:
Look at his neck.

99
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,300
What do you mean?

100
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,400
All the ambulance
guys wanted to do

101
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,200
was lift him up and
get him out of here.

102
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,900
I don't get a bonus for saying
something smells fishy.

103
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,800
Just go upstairs,
look at his neck.

104
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,100
This man did not die
in his sleep.

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,500
I've taken a look at your
late husband, Mrs. Rykoff.

106
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
We have a problem.

107
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,600
No, there is no problem.

108
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,900
My husband served
the state for 32 years.

109
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,700
He's entitled to privacy
with regard to his life

110
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,800
and dignity with regard
to his death.

111
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,600
Buhe did not die
in his sleep.

112
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,300
We're not even convinced
he died in that bed.

113
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,900
Is my client being accused of something here,
Mr. District Attorney?

114
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,100
Not yet.

115
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,800
My husband and I
were married for 37 years.

116
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,900
In 37 years, a couple
can grow very close

117
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,100
and very distant
at the same time.

118
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,100
Henry got up in the middle
of the night.

119
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,200
It wasn't unusual.

120
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,300
He liked to use the bathroom
down the hall.

121
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,900
I heard him get up,

122
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,200
make his
way down the hall in the dark.

123
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,100
I even heard him cough
and wheeze through the wall.

124
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,800
He had that cold
that's been going around.

125
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,300
I must have fallen back asleep,
and when I woke up again,

126
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,600
I realized that Henry
still hadn't returned.

127
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,500
Finally,
I came down here.

128
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,600
He had taken the belt
of his robe...

129
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,100
used that beam,

130
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
put it around his neck.

131
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,300
I kept screaming his name...

132
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,200
but I think he was already dead.

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Mrs. Rykoff, I will do
everything in my power

134
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,500
to be sure that when a death
certificate is issued...

135
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,900
He did not commit suicide.

136
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,600
Nothing could have been further
from his mind.

137
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,400
And you know this how?

138
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,900
I know this
because Mrs. Rykoff called me

139
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
to help her get the body
down from the ceiling.

140
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,400
I know this
because when I came in the room,

141
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,800
his computer was on.

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,400
There was a pornographic
Web site on the screen.

143
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,700
His pajama bottoms
were around his ankles

144
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,000
and was clear from the state
of the rest of his body

145
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,300
exactly what he was doing,

146
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,000
exactly what his intention was.

147
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,800
And it had nothing to do
with killing oneself.

148
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,800
And you helped Mrs. Rykoff
move the body?

149
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,900
Yes.

150
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,800
Up the stairs
and down the hall

151
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,100
and into the bedroom.

152
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,800
I beg of you all,

153
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,800
let my husband be remembered
for his great work

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,800
and not for some foolishness

155
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,700
no one was ever meant
to know about.

156
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,200
BOY:
Help me!

157
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,000
Do you hear that?

158
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Somebody!

159
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
What are you doing?

160
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,000
Put your head
on the pillow,
close your eyes and let's get some sleep.

161
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,200
You didn't hear that either?

162
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,400
Shh.

163
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,700
BOY:
Help me! Please!

164
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,600
Help me!

165
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,500
Please! Somebody!

166
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,500
Look Like he was
in some kind of a hole

167
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,700
or maybe it was a cave
or some kind of a well, or...

168
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Whatever it was, it looked
like it was natural,

169
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,600
not man-made.

170
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,800
That's great, but, Allison,

171
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,200
there are no missing children
of that approximate age

172
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
who match anything close
to that description.

173
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,300
What do you mean?

174
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,400
I mean, you may
have dreamt it,

175
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,600
but it doesn't appear
to have happened--

176
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,200
not yet, not
around here anyway.

177
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,600
Well, maybe his parents
haven't reported it yet.

178
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,300
Maybe they don't realize
he's missing.

179
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,100
You said he was dirty,
you said he looked like

180
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,700
he'd been wherever
he was for a while.

181
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,300
I mean, come on,
if your child was missing

182
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,200
for long enough to be beat up
by the elements like that

183
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
you'd notice, you'd report it.

184
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,400
What are you saying?

185
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,300
I'm saying there's nothing
more I can do.

186
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,000
I can't mount a search until
I have someone to search for.

187
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,800
And honestly, I've got
about ten other fires

188
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
I got to put out
this morning, including...

189
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,100
one that you might
be interested in.

190
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,900
What's this?

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,900
The coroner's report
on Assemblyman Rykoff.

192
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,100
What am I looking at?

193
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,800
"High levels
of dexohyphrodan..."

194
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,000
Dexohydrophan.

195
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,200
"were present
in the deceased's system."

196
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,200
What's that?

197
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
It's a libido inhibitor.

198
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,000
It's like anti-Viagra.
Kills the sex drive.

199
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,300
I don't get it.

200
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,400
Neither do I.

201
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,100
Dexohydrophan is a drug
usually reserved

202
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,200
for chronic sex offenders.

203
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,500
You're saying Assemblyman Rykoff
was a sex offender?

204
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,300
Of course not.

205
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,600
But I got a better question.

206
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,900
Why's a guy who's loaded to
the gills on libido-inhibitors

207
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,300
hanging from a belt with his
John Thomas in his hand,

208
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,600
looking at Internet porn?

209
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,400
Girls down?

210
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,400
All except Ariel,

211
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,800
who just asked me
what "clubbing" is.

212
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,300
And when will she be
old enough to do it.

213
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,300
I feel like

214
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,400
I looked at a million files,

215
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,100
stared at a billion pictures.

216
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,900
All of those kids.

217
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,000
I just know he's out there,
scared and alone.

218
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,100
If one of our girls...

219
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,000
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh.

220
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,100
They're fine.

221
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,400
They're in bed.

222
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,400
All except
for Ariel.

223
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,100
She wants to know
what "clubbing" is.

224
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,000
I see you.
I see you up there.

225
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,800
Hey, where are you going?

226
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,700
No, please, you can't leave me.

227
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,900
No! Please don't leave me!

228
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,300
Allison, hey, what
are you doing?

229
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,300
I saw it, the place
where the boy is.

230
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,300
It's this hole, this glowing
hole in the ground.

231
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,800
I've got to call Scanlon.

232
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,800
Hold on a second.
You're not making
any sense.

233
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,700
What...

234
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,500
what do you know today
that you didn't know yesterday?

235
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,100
A hole?

236
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,100
You're going to wake the man up
in the middle of the night

237
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,000
to tell him about
a hole in the ground that glows.

238
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Allison...
I got to do something, Joe.

239
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,400
He's drinking green muck.

240
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,500
He's dying out there.

241
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,900
The whole thing
was green.

242
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,100
It glowed green.

243
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,000
Wait a second. Green?

244
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,900
Like phosphorus?

245
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,800
Have you ever heard
of the Living Caves?

246
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,800
No, the Living Caves--
what are they?

247
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,700
Well, they're these
naturally occurring
holes in the ground

248
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,800
and people say
they're living

249
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
because they still
have big pools

250
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
of acidic water
at the bottom of them.

251
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,200
So they're still eroding
away the soil,

252
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,600
forming new passages,
growing, living.

253
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Okay.
Here they are.

254
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,100
Okay, what made you
think of them?

255
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,100
Uh, well, they're
filled with phosphorus,

256
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
so at night they glow.

257
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,300
Okay, show me exactly
where they are.

258
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,300
Allison, there's over 200 square
miles of these caves.

259
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,800
There's no way
to narrow it down.

260
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,600
Wait a second. What's this?

261
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,400
Railroad track?

262
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,300
Railroad track...

263
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Hey, you think you could take the girls
to school?

264
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,500
You're going there?

265
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,000
You're insane.

266
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
ALLISON:
Hello?

267
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,900
Hello?

268
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,800
Hello?!

269
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,400
Hello?

270
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,400
Hello?

271
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,900
Is anyone in there?

272
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,400
BOY:
Hello? Is
somebody up there?

273
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,500
I'm down here. Somebody,
anybody, can you hear me?

274
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,600
Yes, someone's here.

275
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,500
Yes, I can hear you.

276
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,300
Keep talking. There's a lot
of holes around here.

277
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,100
Oh, please, get me out!
Get me out! Get me out!

278
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,300
I'm coming.Keep calling out.

279
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,100
???

280
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,700
Can you hear me?

281
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,500
Get me out!
Get me out!

282
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,400
Oh, please, get me out!

283
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,900
Get me out! Get me out!

284
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,300
I am.

285
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,600
Here, let me throw you down
some water.

286
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,100
I have some food.

287
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,100
I need to call people.
What's your name?

288
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,300
Jimmy... James.
Jamison Nessler.

289
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,900
Hi, Jamison Nessler.

290
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,300
I'm Allison.

291
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,100
How bad is your leg?

292
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,800
It hurts. It's hard to climb.

293
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,900
Okay, I'm not going anywhere.

294
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,900
I'm going to stay right here

295
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,900
and use my phone
to call for help.

296
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,100
You just eat.
I'll be right here.

297
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,600
He's here. He's in this hole.

298
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,200
Young man...

299
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,900
if you can hear me,
I want you to...

300
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,600
Shine a light down there.

301
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,000
No.

302
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,100
No, I just saw him.
I spoke to him.

303
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,100
???? how much it costs

304
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,600
to land an emergency helicopter

305
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,900
with three Forest Service
Rangers in the Arizona desert?

306
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,900
Hmm, no, no, I don't.

307
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,100
$1,700.

308
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,100
$1,700 to pick up a skeleton.

309
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,700
He kept saying,
"A skeleton

310
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,500
"is not an emergency, ma'am.

311
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,600
Do you have any idea
how much this is going to cost?"

312
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,000
Of course, now I do.

313
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,800
Aren't you going
to say anything?

314
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,700
What am I going
to say?

315
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
It's absurd.
I don't have $1,700.

316
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,400
I mean, I have it,
we have it,

317
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,400
but not to spend on unexpected
emergency skeleton pickups.

318
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
I mean, what are they going
to do if we don't pay?

319
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,500
Cut us off?

320
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,100
Not show up the next time we
have bones that need rescuing?

321
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,600
I'm sorry.

322
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,100
WOMAN:
Oh, baby...

323
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,800
Let me have it.

324
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,600
Let me have all of it.

325
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,600
Oh, baby, let me...

326
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,300
ALLISON:
Something
doesn't add up.

327
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,500
I'm talking about the suicide
of Assemblyman Rykoff.

328
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,700
You want to close
that door, please?

329
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,300
That fact that Henry Rykoff
committed suicide

330
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,000
is supposed to be
a closely held secret.

331
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,500
It's not something
we want to talk about

332
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,700
where others can hear.

333
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,900
Of course. I'm sorry.

334
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,300
I'm already pretty far out
on a limb with this thing.

335
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,800
Hiding the material facts
of this man's death,

336
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,900
walking his death certificate
through channels.

337
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,600
For what it's worth,

338
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,700
I don't think he actually did
commit suicide.

339
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,200
You remember Mrs. Dubois
from the other day?

340
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,400
And this is
Detective Lee Scanlon

341
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,300
who works with my office
on a regular basis.

342
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,500
I've taken them
into our confidence.

343
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,200
He's someone
you can trust.

344
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,800
Well, I'll have to take
your word for that.

345
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,700
Now, what am I doing here?

346
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,500
Frankly, Mr. District Attorney,
I have a funeral to plan.

347
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,500
I appreciate that this
is a difficult time.

348
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,500
But if I'm going to get you
a death certificate

349
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,800
that indicates your husband died
in his sleep of natural causes,

350
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,400
I'm going to need your help
answering some questions.

351
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,200
Mr Rykoff, did you
know your husband was
taking dexohydrophan?

352
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,400
Do you know what
dexohydrophan is?

353
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,900
Well, you people are
just determined

354
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,700
to wake up every sleeping dog
in the village, aren't you?

355
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,400
Yes, I am familiar
with the drug,

356
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,300
and I was entirely aware
that my husband was taking it.

357
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,000
He had been taking it since...

358
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
some time in the early '90s.

359
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,400
Mrs. Rykoff,

360
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,600
it's my unrstanding that
this drug is normally prescribed

361
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
to registered sex offenders.

362
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,700
Why would the assembly...?

363
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Years ago, I became aware
that in addition

364
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,400
to Henry's voracious ambition,
he also possessed

365
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,500
a seemingly endless
appetite for...

366
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,800
What's the polite way to say it?
Companionship?

367
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,200
Not that he didn't love me.

368
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,000
I never doubted that.

369
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,900
But, apparently, in addition

370
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,300
he needed something
more dangerous,

371
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,400
something more...
varied.

372
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,900
And you knew about this?

373
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,700
I sensed it.

374
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,800
We had no children.

375
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,400
He was extraordinarily
busy with his career.

376
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,900
I still couldn't account
for all his time.

377
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,600
One night,
he came to me.

378
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,400
He was terrified.

379
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,000
Something had happened.

380
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,000
He never told me what,
and I never asked.

381
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,600
Someone got pregnant, I suspect.

382
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,100
Whatever it was,
whatever he had to do

383
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,700
to clean up after himself...

384
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,800
it changed him.

385
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,100
He confessed to me
that he just had these

386
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,000
compulsions, he called them.

387
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
That he hated himself for it.

388
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,900
So he found this place
in Minneapolis.

389
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,800
He spent two weeks,
intense counseling,

390
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,900
medication.

391
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,800
And it seemed
to work for him?

392
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,100
It certainly worked for us.

393
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,600
It became our secret...

394
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,400
our deep, dark secret.

395
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,800
Until today.

396
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,300
Actually bound us together
in a way

397
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,300
that old-fashioned intimacy
never did.

398
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,900
So now you know everything.

399
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,100
I'm sorry.

400
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,000
I still don't understand.

401
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
When you found your husband
the other night,

402
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,400
it appears he was trying

403
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,600
to get a kind of a, um,
heightened...

404
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,400
The drug kills the ability
to get aroused,

405
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,700
but not the instinct.

406
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,600
The way you sometimes

407
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,600
see a neutered dog

408
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,200
Oh, I felt so horrible
for him sometimes.

409
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,600
Is there anything else?

410
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,600
I-I really would like
to put him, this,

411
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,100
all of this to rest.

412
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm good.

413
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,400
I think we're
all good.

414
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
That's him.

415
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,300
That's the boy from my dream.

416
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,400
Ain't modern science amazing?
Just like on TV.

417
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,700
You give those guys
a bag of bones,

418
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,700
a day later, you get
a name and a school picture.

419
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,100
Say hello to Jimmy Nessler.
Jimmy Nessler.

420
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,900
He just turned 12 at the time
of his disappearance,

421
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,700
which his parents first reported
to police in 1991.

422
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
1991?

423
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,100
My God, his parents--
I can't imagine their pain.

424
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,700
One of those nightmares
you hear about

425
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,800
from time to time.

426
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,300
Only child.

427
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,200
Kids gets on his bike
to go to school one morning,

428
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,300
never comes home.

429
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,700
Nobody saw him,
never left any clues.

430
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,900
Just, uh, vanished.

431
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,300
It was an exhaustive search.It went on for months.

432
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,300
Has anyone called 'em yet?

433
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,000
I mean, his parents?

434
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,300
Left the state in '94.

435
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,200
The father died in a car
accident two years later.

436
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,800
His blood-alcohol level
was through the roof.

437
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,700
Mother had a series
of mental problems.

438
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,800
In and out of homeless shelters
through the late '90s.

439
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
After that...

440
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,900
So nothing's different?

441
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,600
If I'd never seen what I saw,
if I never found what I found...

442
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,100
everything would
still be the same?

443
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,800
MAN:
Time to wake up, Jimmy.

444
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,600
You doing all right?

445
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,000
That was quite a little nap
you had for yourself.

446
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,200
Can I get you
more to drink?

447
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,000
Where's my clothes?

448
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,900
You wanted to take a swim.

449
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,300
Do you remember taking a swim?

450
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,400
They're over there.

451
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,800
Did you have a good time?

452
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,100
I hope you had a good time.

453
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,800
And don't worry.

454
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm not going to let
anyone know you were here.

455
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,600
I know how much trouble
a kid your age can get into

456
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,800
by skipping school.

457
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,900
Did you put
the dirty magazines back?

458
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
Can't have my wife
finding those.

459
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,300
But if you ever
want to look at 'em again...

460
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,500
I can even make you
one of my special drinks.

461
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,200
Nice meeting you, Jimmy.

462
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,700
Go after him.Make sure he's okay.

463
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,300
He's okay.

464
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,500
He's drunk.

465
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
He's young. He's sweet.

466
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,500
You know, I'm only
a couple years older.

467
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,100
It's not about that.

468
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,200
Just go after him.

469
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,800
???

470
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,400
Look at you.

471
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,700
I'm impressed.

472
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,500
There's nothing impressive
about a 55-year-old man

473
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,700
who gets up before dawn
to trudge a mile and a half

474
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,700
just because he's convinced
if he doesn't

475
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,500
he'll die ten years
before his time.

476
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,300
I beg to differ.
I'm impressed.

477
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,600
Duly noted.

478
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,700
What brings you out
at this ridiculous hour?

479
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,700
I called your house

480
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,400
and your wife said
you already left.

481
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,400
Henry Rykoff, the dead
assemblyman,

482
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,000
knew Jimmy Nessler.

483
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,400
Okay.

484
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,600
Allison, Jimmy Nessler's
been dead almost 15 years.

485
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,100
He died from a combination

486
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,600
of starvation,
dehydration and exposure.

487
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,700
Assemblyman Rykoff
died several days ago

488
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,100
and in my opinion,
by his own hand.

489
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,700
What do the two have
to do with each other?

490
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,500
I don't know. Something.

491
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,100
I think when
Mrs. Rykoff was talking about

492
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,400
the assemblyman's... appetites,

493
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,600
And I presume all of this came
to you the way that most things

494
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,000
come to you?

495
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,300
I'm sorry, but I don't see
how any of this is relevant to anything.

496
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,300
The boy is dead.

497
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,900
Rykoff is dead.

498
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,100
Since we can be
reasonably certain

499
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,100
that the dead boy
didn't kill Rykoff...?

500
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,800
What if it's
the other way around?

501
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,600
I just like to confirm, in fact,
the assemblyman knew the boy.

502
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,600
Why?

503
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,500
i'm sorry.I know why.

504
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,300
I guess what
I'm really trying to say is would it be

505
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,400
such a terrible thing to just let sleeping dogs lie?

506
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Yes!

507
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,600
Isn't Jimmy Nessler
entitled to justice?

508
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,300
If someone stole his life,

509
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,400
isn't it our job
to find out who did it?

510
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,700
Of course, it is,
but the victim is long dead

511
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,900
and the man you think might
be responsible is dead, too.

512
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,100
And frankly, I'm dubious
that any of  is true.

513
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,900
And I strongly doubt
that even if it were,we could prove
any of it.

514
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,600
What I am convinced of,given the times in which we live

515
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,700
and the climate
in which we work,

516
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,700
if you go swimming around
in all this muck,

517
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,900
you will definitely stir up
some kind of dirt

518
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,400
and it may reflect badly
on a man who isn't alive

519
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,800
to defend himself.

520
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,000
So where does that leave us?

521
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'd still like to try
and find out if he knew the boy.

522
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,500
And how do you hope to do that?

523
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,400
Ask!

524
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,900
No, I am not bringing
his widow back here.

525
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,200
She wasn't out the door
ten minutes

526
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,100
and the governor was
on the phone lecturing me

527
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,900
about decency and fairness

528
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,000
and respect
for the grieving.

529
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,100
Can I talk to his attorney?

530
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
Or what about that aide of his?

531
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,500
The one that his wife called
to help move the body?

532
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,700
Sir?!

533
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,800
I have to take
a shower.

534
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,300
Just stay away from the widow.

535
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,700
And if the governor calls,
I'm putting him on with you.

536
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,100
I'm sure he knew him
or at least knew of him.

537
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,400
We all did. I did.

538
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,400
It was a big deal
when this kid went missing.

539
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,800
I mean, our school
organized search parties.

540
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,300
I think I was in
the tenth grade

541
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,500
and he was in,
like, seventh.

542
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,300
Yeah, definitely
the assemblyman

543
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,300
was almost certainly
aware of him.

544
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,900
No, I mean,
before he went missing.

545
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,800
Do you think they knew
each other, Mr. Frank?

546
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,000
Casey. Call me Casey.

547
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,200
I don't know-- this
is all before my time.

548
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,800
I didn't start working
for Mr. Rykoff

549
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,100
until I was out of college.

550
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,100
Hmm. But you knew him?

551
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,100
I did yard work
for the Rykoffs.

552
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,300
And Mr. Rykoff was very much
a father figure to me.

553
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,700
Really pushed me
to go to college,

554
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,700
which I was not
inclined to do.

555
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,000
Introduced me to politics,

556
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
or "public service,"
which is what

557
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,900
he liked to call it.

558
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,000
But again,
back then,

559
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,300
I was in high school.
I have no idea he knew Jimmy.

560
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I mean, why would he?

561
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,500
Let me ask you a question.

562
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,200
I read just this morning
that you were being asked to run

563
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,400
to fill the assemblyman's
vacant seat.

564
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,300
You're young.

565
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,900
You're at the beginning
of your career.

566
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,400
You get a call in the middle
of the night

567
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,800
to move a dead body,

568
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,300
to disturb what may be
a crime scene.

569
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,500
At the very least,

570
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,100
you must know you're putting
your future on the line.

571
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,300
Why did you do it?

572
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,300
Same reason you and your
bosses are working

573
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,000
so hard to cover it up.

574
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,600
Because he's earned that.

575
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,300
Because it's the
right thing to do.

576
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,400
Because I was asked.

577
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,400
You make it sound like
a privilege, fudging the truth.

578
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,100
Maybe I've been in politics
too long, but yes,

579
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,200
I consider it an honor

580
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,700
to be asked to help a great man

581
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,500
maintain his dignity at a moment

582
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,600
when he doesn't have the
strength tdo it for himself.

583
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,100
So you really admired him?

584
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,700
I like to think
I understood him.

585
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,600
You know, with all
he accomplished,

586
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,400
Henry Rykoff was actually

587
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,800
a very lonely and
disconnected man.

588
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,400
But I'll tell you something,
when I was a kid,

589
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,500
when I was constantly
being told

590
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,800
that I was not the smartest boy
in the room or the best-looking

591
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,300
or the strongest
or the fastest,

592
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,200
Henry Rykoff--
and I don't know why--

593
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,300
was the first adult to sayto me "Y

594
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,300
"There's a future for you
if you want it,

595
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,600
if you're willing
to work for it."

596
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,300
He wrote letters
of recommendation

597
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,700
to get me into school,

598
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,700
loaned my mom money
for tuition,

599
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,700
and when I graduated,

600
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,700
he immediately took me
under his wing,

601
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,200
made me part of his staff.

602
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,100
Why?

603
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:01,300
I think he sensed I might
have been a bit lonely,

604
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,100
a bit disconnected, too.

605
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,400
Jim!

606
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,100
Jimmy...

607
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,000
You okay?

608
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,700
No, I'm not okay!

609
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,100
I don't feel good!

610
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,900
I feel sick!

611
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,600
And now I'm going to get in
trouble for skipping school.

612
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,100
And I think you
and that old guy,

613
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,400
I think you're a couple
of pervs.

614
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,500
What are you talking about?

615
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,200
You know what I'm talking about!

616
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,900
How'd my clothes
get off of me?!

617
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,400
You wanted to swim.

618
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,400
No, I didn't!
I don't even know how to swim!

619
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,200
I feel so sick.

620
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,300
I need my mom.

621
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,100
You're a perv and that
other guy's a perv.

622
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,900
And I'm telling my mom.

623
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,800
You put something in my soda.

624
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,700
Nobody's telling
anybody anything.

625
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,100
You understand?

626
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,500
Nobody is telling anybody
anything.

627
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Now you sit back down

628
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,300
and I promise you
you'll feel better soon.

629
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm going home.

630
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,000
And I'm telling...
No, you're not!

631
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,800
Now don't be stupid.

632
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,200
You're not going anywhere.

633
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,700
Not until you calm down.

634
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,300
What do you think you're
gonna say to your mother?

635
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,800
Do you know who
that old guy was?

636
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,600
Do you know how important he is?

637
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,700
There!

638
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,000
What are you doing?

639
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,500
I'm getting my bike.

640
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,900
Getting your bike?

641
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:23,900
What are you, nuts?

642
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,600
You can't even see the bottom of...
Shut up! I'm getting it.

643
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,700
You don't seem to be
making much progress.

644
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,000
This was dumb.
Help me out.

645
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,700
What, so you can
run home to Mommy and tell her all kinds of lies?

646
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,500
Just help me out.
Give me your hand.

647
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,700
What are you going
to tell Mommy?

648
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,300
Just give me your hand!

649
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,300
Swear to...

650
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,500
Oh...

651
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,300
Jimmy!

652
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,100
Jimmy!

653
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,200
He's dead.

654
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,700
What?

655
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,900
These are his books.

656
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,200
They're the only thing left.

657
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,400
He fell.

658
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,300
I mean, he was climbing
because I threw his bike

659
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,600
and he asked me for help,
but I-I couldn't help.

660
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,900
Put those in here.

661
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,100
Casey... my Casey.

662
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,100
Casey.

663
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,000
CASEY:
So, how can I be of help?

664
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,700
As you may or may
not be aware,

665
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,100
when we recovered
Jimmy Nessler's remains

666
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,900
earlier in the week

667
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,400
from the bottom
of that living cave

668
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,200
we also recovered
some other artifacts

669
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,300
that apparently
had been down there

670
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,300
as long as he had.
Okay...

671
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,800
A bicycle, that
apparently was his,

672
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,800
some microscopic
bits of fiber

673
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,600
that we believe is all
that's left of his clothes

674
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,000
after 15 years
in the elements,

675
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,300
and a Saint Christopher's medal.

676
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,300
This is all fascinating, but...

677
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,200
The back of the medal was
engraved with the initials

678
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,500
"C-E-F."

679
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,400
Those are your initials,
aren't they?

680
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,300
Casey Edward Frank.

681
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,800
Also the date,
11-15-74.

682
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,100
That's your birthday.

683
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,000
So you're suggesting...?

684
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,200
That perhaps it might
just be your medal.

685
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,000
Okay, I'll concede that.
It just might be.

686
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,900
What's the point?

687
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,800
No point.

688
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,300
Not a big one anyway.

689
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,500
Just that, you told Mrs. Dubois

690
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,000
only yesterday
that you really didn't know

691
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,900
the Nessler boy,
not personally.

692
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,300
And I didn't. Did I play
near those caves?

693
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,900
Horse around there?

694
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,700
Sure. Everyone did.

695
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,500
Is it possible that I
dropped or lost my medal?

696
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,000
Sure. Where are you
going with this?

697
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,100
Not going anywhere.

698
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,300
Just, now that you're going
to be running for public office,

699
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,600
now that you're going to be

700
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,400
under some scrutiny,
we just want to give you

701
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,900
a chance to revise
your statement

702
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,800
with regard to how
well you knew

703
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,600
the Nessler boy,
if... you chose to.

704
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,700
I don't need
to revise my statement.

705
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,000
I stand by what I said.

706
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,200
Are we through here?

707
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,400
Just one more thing,
uh, as you know I'm...

708
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,900
working to get the coroner

709
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,800
to issue a death certificate
for Assemblyman Rykoff

710
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,600
that would indicate he
died of natural causes,

711
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,200
and I almost had
him there, but...

712
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,200
then he realized that
the trauma to the back

713
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,300
of the assemblyman's neck

714
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,800
was as severe as the trauma
to the front.

715
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,400
I'm sorry.

716
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,400
You're losing me.
If a man wereto hang himself,

717
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,300
even if it
was only a botched attempt

718
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,900
to heighten sexual sensation,

719
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,600
the trauma would only occur
to the front of the neck--

720
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
the place where the noose
and the throat meet.

721
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,400
It would take someone coming up
from behind the assemblyman,

722
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,600
strangling him with great force,

723
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,700
to create the kind of trauma
apparent at the back

724
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,800
of the neck.

725
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,600
Wh... what are you saying?
We're saying that

726
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,900
it appears that someone
murdered Henry Rykoff,

727
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,500
then staged it to make it
look as though

728
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,400
he accidentally
caused his own death.

729
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,000
And you think
that someone is me.

730
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,100
With any murder case,

731
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,400
we look for means,
motive and opportunity.

732
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,100
You certainly
had the means.

733
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,000
You have the physical
strength to strangle

734
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,400
the assemblyman and lift
him into that noose.

735
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You had the opportunity.

736
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,900
We're very
aware that you

737
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,600
had a key
to the Rykoff residence

738
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,700
along with their alarm codes,
that you frequently took care

739
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,300
of their home
when they were away.

740
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,200
And as far as the motive,

741
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,300
congratulations
on running unopposed

742
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,100
to fill the assemblyman's seat.

743
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,400
That's absurd. This
whole thing's absurd

744
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,200
Everyone knew I was being
groomed as Henry's successor.

745
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,700
Everyone knew he was
planning to retire

746
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,600
after this term.
Do you honestly believe

747
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,600
I would kill a man
to take something

748
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,000
he was prepared to give me
a year and a half from now?

749
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,400
I'm going to remember
this moment,

750
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,800
Mr. District Attorney.

751
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,500
When I'm sitting in the
state capital building

752
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,000
staring at your budget,

753
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,600
contemplating anything
to do with you

754
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,100
or your office, I will
remember this moment.

755
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,800
I thought you were
a smart man.

756
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,300
I thought you were smart people.

757
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,200
But smart people don't make
absurd allegations.

758
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,500
And they certainly don't
make absurd allegations

759
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,600
they can't prove.

760
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,200
I'll see myself out.

761
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,600
He's right. We can't
prove a damn thing and he knows it.
(sighing)

762
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,400
ALLISON:
I know what happened.

763
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,500
I know who did it.
I just can't prove it.

764
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And I'm never
going to be able to.

765
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,900
Well, you know
what you need?

766
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,600
A good night's sleep.

767
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,300
Trust me. Just
close your eyes,

768
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,300
get some rest and
everything will look better in the morning.
(groaning)

769
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,100
That's easy for you to say.

770
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,400
You're right.
In fact, I think I'll say it again.

771
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,200
Close your eyes...

772
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,800
Shut up.

773
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,300
CASEY:
Hey, you wanted to see me?

774
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,800
Casey, my Casey.

775
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,700
Thanks for coming over, um...

776
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,000
I've been thinking a lot
about the plans we made,

777
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,700
my...

778
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
not running this term,
endorsing you.

779
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,100
Truth is, I just don't
think I can do it.

780
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,400
What?

781
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,200
I'm gonna run again.

782
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,400
And I'd very much
like your help.

783
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,300
Are you forgetting
I know things?

784
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,600
I know things that would
make it very difficult

785
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,100
for you to get reelected.

786
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,500
That's a silly threat,
young man.

787
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,700
You know things.

788
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,200
And everything you know about me
involves you, too.

789
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,200
So while you might
be able

790
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,600
to tarnish me at the end
of my career,

791
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,400
you'll destroy your own
in the process.

792
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,900
Well, I might do it anyway.

793
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,800
I don't want to wait
another four years.

794
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,800
I can't.
You can.

795
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,500
And you will.

796
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,700
Now let's not forget
who has what on whom.

797
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,800
You have nothing on me.

798
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,000
I'm the victim in all this.

799
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,700
That's not the way
I see it.

800
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,700
The Nessler boy's book bag.

801
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,600
Covered with your
fingerprints all over it.

802
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,600
Maybe not enough to prove
you killed him,

803
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,400
but you'd certainly have
a lot of questions to answer.

804
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,800
So... let's calm down.

805
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,100
It's only four more years.

806
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,600
And who knows?

807
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,300
Maybe you'll get lucky.

808
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,300
I could die in office.

809
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,100
Everything okay?
Everything's fine.

810
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,000
Everything's great.

811
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,200
You were right.

812
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,000
I closed my eyes
and suddenly

813
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,100
everything was better.

814
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
Who are you calling?

815
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,000
A locksmith I know.

816
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,900
Sorry to wake you,
Mr. District Attorney.

817
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:01,900
Uh...

818
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,500
there's a safe that you
and I need to crack right now.

819
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,014
welcome to www.1000fr.com
