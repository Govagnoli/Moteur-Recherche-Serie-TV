1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:01,861
- I'm sorry... It's blinking. 
- Really? 

2
00:00:01,966 --> 00:00:02,761
Yeah look... 

3
00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:10,261
Hey Ally, it's me... Coming from beautiful downtown Afghanistan.

4
00:00:10,348 --> 00:00:13,969
And this over here is my buddy Tommy Lehane.

5
00:00:14,158 --> 00:00:17,593
Two-time Orange County short board surfing champion

6
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:19,672
and my personal bodyguard...

7
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:21,402
Hey, hey, hey, Michael's sister.

8
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:24,050
Hey, is she hot, dude? Can you hook me up?

9
00:00:24,214 --> 00:00:26,769
Chill, brother. She's totally married.

10
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,391
And a mom.

11
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:30,454
Hey, Joe. Hey, kids.

12
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:33,169
Uh, Bridgette, Ariel, and...

13
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,663
I can't remember what the other one's name is.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,089
Anyways, Uncle Mike is doing fine.

15
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:42,226
Just over here fighting for freedom and beer...

16
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:46,460
and chips and dip and whatnot.

17
00:00:46,525 --> 00:00:50,039
So don't worry. The company just sent us this camera

18
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,567
so we could send back video letters,

19
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:53,705
and I was the first one who got it, so...

20
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:55,543
Yeah, 'cause he's still learning how to write.

21
00:00:56,512 --> 00:00:58,801
Stand down, soldier. Stand down.

22
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:01,913
Anyways, we're over here in, uh...

23
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:03,843
I don't even know where the hell we are.

24
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:04,815
We just got here.

25
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:09,024
Uh, we're protecting some shelled-out little village that nobody's ever heard of.

26
00:01:09,312 --> 00:01:10,586
And this over here...

27
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,542
Incoming!

28
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:17,516
Incoming! Medic!

29
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:18,903
Medic!

30
00:02:10,152 --> 00:02:11,847
Benoit. B-E-N-0-I-T.

31
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,650
He's with the 47th Infantry.

32
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,786
My name? Dubois.

33
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:19,814
Well, I'm married.

34
00:02:21,713 --> 00:02:23,607
No. Benoit's not my maiden name.

35
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:26,568
He's my half brother.

36
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:29,168
No, wait, wait.

37
00:02:30,243 --> 00:02:32,143
I just called them. They told me to call you.

38
00:02:33,183 --> 00:02:34,365
Yes, I'll hold.

39
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:37,038
Hey, there's nothing on the CNN website

40
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,197
or the State Department home page about any attack involving the 47th.

41
00:02:40,264 --> 00:02:41,508
The kids are dressed, they're fed.

42
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,468
- So I'm just going to run them off to school.
- Hello?

43
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:46,254
Hello. Yes, I'm looking for information on the 47th Infantry.

44
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,060
My brother-- Specialist Michael Benoit.

45
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,317
Ma'am, please don't transfer me.

46
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:54,764
I have been on the phone with every branch of the government since 5:30 a.m.

47
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:58,246
She's going to check. She's actually going to check.

48
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:00,995
Yes, I am a family member.

49
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:01,744
Hey.

50
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:03,277
I'm his sister.

51
00:03:04,427 --> 00:03:06,334
Okay, you're transferring me to who?

52
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,560
All right, can you give me the direct dial number just in case we get...

53
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:11,418
Hello? Hello?

54
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,254
Damn it!

55
00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:15,674
Got disconnected.

56
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:19,432
Is Mom okay?

57
00:03:19,504 --> 00:03:20,605
Mom's just worried.

58
00:03:20,753 --> 00:03:23,123
Take your sister. Put her in the car seat. I'll be right out.

59
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:25,068
Okay, good girl.

60
00:03:25,196 --> 00:03:26,728
Okay, go on, go on.

61
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:28,616
Here.

62
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:30,844
- What are you doing, Joe?
- Just stop for a minute.

63
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:32,544
You've been on the phone for three hours.

64
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:35,227
I've checked all the news services and the government websites.

65
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,527
You've called every agency imaginable.

66
00:03:37,778 --> 00:03:40,337
And no one knows anything about any ambush on the 47th.

67
00:03:40,402 --> 00:03:41,644
Well, maybe they haven't found them yet.

68
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,348
Maybe they're not releasing the information.

69
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:46,056
Maybe it hasn't happened yet.

70
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:47,506
I could warn them, Joe.

71
00:03:47,572 --> 00:03:49,374
I could warn them, if someone would just listen to me.

72
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,788
It's 8:25 in the morning.

73
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:52,497
Don't you have an appointment with your boss at 10:00?

74
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:53,930
Yeah. I don't think I'm going to make that.

75
00:03:53,997 --> 00:03:57,241
Right. You need to stay home and worry about something that may or may not have happened

76
00:03:57,296 --> 00:04:00,284
to someone you haven't seen in five years and didn't much like before that.

77
00:04:00,356 --> 00:04:02,240
- He's my brother.
- Well...

78
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:04,469
Well, we have the same mother.

79
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,338
Okay, but you didn't exactly grow up together.

80
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,382
I don't care about that. I'm talking about somebody who might be laying dead in the dirt somewhere.

81
00:04:09,463 --> 00:04:11,498
More likely passed out in a bar somewhere.

82
00:04:11,554 --> 00:04:12,896
I can't believe you just said that.

83
00:04:12,957 --> 00:04:15,752
Allison, the man missed our wedding because he was so stoned at the airport

84
00:04:15,815 --> 00:04:18,549
and having such a trippy time watching the planes taking off and landing,

85
00:04:18,606 --> 00:04:19,781
that he forgot to get on one.

86
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:21,390
That was 11 years ago.

87
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,328
Look, I'm just saying it's the 21st century, okay?

88
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,201
When something like this happens, it's on the news in 15 minutes.

89
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:28,969
I think the thing to do is go on with our day.

90
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:30,442
You know what? Go on with your day.

91
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:32,490
So you're not going to work?

92
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:33,883
I'm going to work!

93
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:35,439
I'm going to work!

94
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:39,514
I love you, too.

95
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:43,190
And in international news today, no reports of American casualties

96
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:46,954
for the sixth straight day in either Iraq or Afghanistan...

97
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:50,892
Oil production remains steady as tensions continue to ease

98
00:04:50,938 --> 00:04:54,378
and American forces report no casualties for the sixth straight day in a row...

99
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,503
It's not a police action, it's a war.

100
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:58,684
Well, right now it's apparently no action,

101
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:03,230
since reports from both Iraq and Afghanistan indicate a prolonged period of calm.

102
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:08,345
- What's this?
- What does it look like?

103
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:10,379
- An address.
- Incredible.

104
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:11,909
And still some people doubt you.

105
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:13,655
You know, I'm so not in the mood.

106
00:05:13,998 --> 00:05:14,695
Sorry.

107
00:05:17,457 --> 00:05:18,264
Something wrong?

108
00:05:19,462 --> 00:05:20,660
I don't know. Maybe not.

109
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:22,759
Certainly all the evidence says it's nothing.

110
00:05:24,644 --> 00:05:26,941
It's nothing. So what's this?

111
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:28,533
Like you said, just an address.

112
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:31,832
But I'd like you to drive over there, maybe spend some time.

113
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,455
See if you get any kind of impression off of it.

114
00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:35,819
I mean, is it a house? Is it a business?

115
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:38,145
I'm confused. Is it a crime scene?

116
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:40,060
I mean, isn't there some kind of file I could look at?

117
00:05:40,162 --> 00:05:40,909
Nope.

118
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,621
If it's all right with you, I'd like to hear what you think after you've been there.

119
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:47,054
Without any kind of influence from me.

120
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:45,402
Who are you?

121
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:52,487
I asked who you were.

122
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,654
My name's Allison.

123
00:06:57,255 --> 00:06:58,268
What's your name?

124
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,294
Is this your house?

125
00:07:02,753 --> 00:07:03,978
I'm Diedre.

126
00:07:08,252 --> 00:07:09,523
Are you Daddy's friend?

127
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:12,769
Mom says you're the reason he comes home late every night

128
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:14,766
and is on the phone all the time.

129
00:07:15,922 --> 00:07:18,166
No, honey, I've never even met your dad.

130
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:20,511
Is he here?

131
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:21,487
No.

132
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,408
Not since the fire.

133
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:27,242
Since the fire, Mom says he's with her.

134
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:29,730
What about your mom? Is she here?

135
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:31,504
I have to go to my room.

136
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:32,548
Wait.

137
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:36,138
Wait.

138
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:46,035
The fire was set intentionally in two places at around 3:00 in the morning.

139
00:07:46,105 --> 00:07:48,600
The first ignition site was outside the daughter's room.

140
00:07:48,645 --> 00:07:51,215
The second ignition site was the master bedroom.

141
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:55,368
We believe that the wife woke up and tried to save the daughter but couldn't.

142
00:07:55,444 --> 00:07:58,339
The daughter perished. The wife has been in a coma for several weeks.

143
00:07:58,413 --> 00:08:00,062
She's not expected to recover.

144
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:01,457
What about the husband?

145
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:04,308
Husband claims to have been working all night in his office

146
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:05,895
trying to get out a last minute deadline.

147
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:06,979
Anyone corroborate that?

148
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,296
His assistant.

149
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,191
A woman.

150
00:08:10,277 --> 00:08:12,664
The daughter mentioned that her father had a friend.

151
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:15,039
Sounds like the marriage had some trouble.

152
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:17,352
The daughter mentioned that?

153
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:20,221
She happen to tell you who set the fire?

154
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:22,324
Well, she wanted to, but I wouldn't let her.

155
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:24,869
I told her you'd be upset if she made it too easy for us.

156
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:28,245
Any chance the assistant's the friend?

157
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:29,431
We're watching both of them.

158
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,522
So how'd you like to spend some quality time with the comatose mother?

159
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:34,899
Excuse me?

160
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,149
Well, I don't really know how these things work, but you never know.

161
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:41,309
She might have seen something-- might have even seen who did it.

162
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:46,275
But how does that work? If someone's in a coma do you... can you...?

163
00:08:46,352 --> 00:08:48,564
I don't know. But she's in the hospital, right?

164
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:50,274
I'm really not crazy about hospitals.

165
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:53,428
Oh. Well, I just assumed. I mean, you've had three kids.

166
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,454
You know what, it's fine. Set it up. I'll be fine.

167
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:03,889
...yards from the Americans. Two Americans were killed. A third died...

168
00:09:04,196 --> 00:09:07,201
...views on democracy and the Middle East has...

169
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:12,531
Okay, kisses, stories...

170
00:09:12,782 --> 00:09:14,205
It is so not my bedtime.

171
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:16,433
Yeah, we want to watch cartoons.

172
00:09:17,574 --> 00:09:18,553
Someone's here.

173
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:25,401
There's a car in front of the house.

174
00:09:25,475 --> 00:09:29,172
It has a big eagle on the door, like the President's car.

175
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:32,602
Dad, two soldiers are getting out.

176
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:33,964
Oh, my God.

177
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:38,020
Ariel, go to your room. Take your sister. Go.

178
00:09:59,888 --> 00:10:02,088
You little bastard!

179
00:10:02,171 --> 00:10:04,165
You hear that? She called me a bastard.

180
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:07,050
My own sister called me a bastard.

181
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:09,211
That's the last time I fight a war for you.

182
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:12,384
- Hey, Joe.
- Welcome home, Mike.

183
00:10:18,762 --> 00:10:19,717
Quit staring.

184
00:10:19,805 --> 00:10:22,103
Ever since he walked in you've been acting like you've seen a ghost,

185
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:23,439
not in your usual way.

186
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:24,725
I can't help it.

187
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:26,179
The dream really spooked me.

188
00:10:26,332 --> 00:10:27,627
Don't say anything, okay?

189
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:29,163
About the dream?

190
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:32,291
About my dream, or working in the D.A.'s office, or any of it.

191
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:33,674
They wouldn't understand.

192
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:34,417
Okay.

193
00:10:36,342 --> 00:10:38,170
I'll get it. Go. Be with your brother.

194
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:46,305
Oh, there we go.

195
00:10:46,557 --> 00:10:48,509
Oh, man, chips and salsa.

196
00:10:48,903 --> 00:10:51,108
Just like Mom used to open.

197
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,639
We've been living on MRE's and hummus for a year.

198
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:55,911
I'll tell you, that gets real old, real fast.

199
00:10:56,018 --> 00:10:58,404
So when did all this happen? When did you get out?

200
00:10:58,895 --> 00:11:01,112
And why didn't you call and let me know you were coming to town?

201
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,392
Our tour just ended last month.

202
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:05,775
Really?

203
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:08,148
Took us about a week to get a transport to Germany.

204
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,882
And then we hung around for a few days until we could hook up

205
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:13,022
something to good old South Carolina.

206
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,545
Finally landed in Sky Harbor today at noon.

207
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:20,087
- God bless America.
- God bless America.

208
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:24,301
And then you were our first stop. So back off, Sis...

209
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:25,981
We could've hitched a ride all the way to Cali,

210
00:11:26,027 --> 00:11:29,211
but Michael said we had to stop here and see his big sister first.

211
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,043
Well... and we have that thing.

212
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:32,996
What thing?

213
00:11:33,655 --> 00:11:35,253
A memorial service.

214
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:38,423
One of our buddies didn't make it back.

215
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,373
Our sergeant.

216
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:41,407
I'm sorry.

217
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:42,915
Yeah, he was a good guy.

218
00:11:45,357 --> 00:11:46,399
Very good guy.

219
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,017
So, Mike...

220
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:51,259
what's your plan now that you're back?

221
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:55,989
Yeah, besides laying on my couch, drinking beer and watching court shows?

222
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:58,780
Well, as a matter of fact...

223
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:04,059
comfortable and roomy as it may be,

224
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:11,009
this couch holds absolutely no interest to this soldier come 0800 Monday morning.

225
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:12,174
Oh, really? Why is that?

226
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,551
That is because

227
00:12:14,586 --> 00:12:18,641
that is when Tommy and I are off to San Diego, California

228
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,585
to open ourselves up a surf shop.

229
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:22,681
A what shop?

230
00:12:22,788 --> 00:12:27,842
Right on the beach, up to our asses in long boards and beach bunnies.

231
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:33,155
Is that something you want to do or something you're going to do?

232
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:36,186
Oh, no, it's already a done deal. We're already incorporated and everything.

233
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,060
Yeah, Tommy's coming into some money.

234
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:39,770
Yeah, I got a little inheritance from my grandfather.

235
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,169
A friend's renting us the storefront.

236
00:12:41,226 --> 00:12:43,785
Looks like Mikey's grown-up card is finally getting punched.

237
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:47,584
You got it, man. Me and Lucky are gonna be merchants.

238
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:49,279
"Lucky"?

239
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:51,209
It's a nickname.

240
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,769
It's not a nickname, man. I'm telling you, it's a fact.

241
00:12:54,426 --> 00:12:59,259
This guy is my lucky rabbit's foot. He's my four-leaf clover.

242
00:12:59,704 --> 00:13:02,179
Hell, I wouldn't have made it back in one piece if it weren't for him.

243
00:13:02,326 --> 00:13:03,907
- Really?
- Cut him off. Cut him off.

244
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:06,786
No, man, come on. I put my life in this guy's hands, okay?

245
00:13:06,872 --> 00:13:10,282
Everybody did. Lucky said "zig," you zigged.

246
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,826
Lucky said "zag," ooh... you better zag.

247
00:13:12,948 --> 00:13:14,163
Zag, zig, zag.

248
00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:18,866
My tank is full. I have to whiz. So...

249
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:20,987
- Down the hall.
- Oh, whoa, whoa!

250
00:13:21,894 --> 00:13:22,628
I got it.

251
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:25,177
All the way down.

252
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:26,513
The end of the hall.

253
00:13:29,452 --> 00:13:30,711
He's something, ain't he?

254
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:34,105
That's my cab.

255
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,219
Oh, goodness, I forgot. Do you need a place to stay?

256
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:38,612
Oh, no, no, no. No, thanks.

257
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:43,098
No, actually, I'm looking forward to getting a little room service if you know what I mean.

258
00:13:44,735 --> 00:13:45,481
I'm sorry.

259
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:47,601
It was real nice meeting you folks.

260
00:13:48,638 --> 00:13:50,500
Tell the kid I'll be back for him tomorrow, okay?

261
00:13:51,694 --> 00:13:53,592
You sure you don't want to wait and say good-bye to Michael?

262
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,673
Oh, no, that's okay.

263
00:13:54,755 --> 00:13:55,820
You can tuck him in for me.

264
00:13:56,071 --> 00:13:57,827
He looks pretty good, don't you think?

265
00:13:58,984 --> 00:14:01,119
For a functional alcoholic, absolutely.

266
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,536
You know he's still out there drinking by himself?

267
00:14:03,823 --> 00:14:06,844
Wow, who died and appointed you the mayor of Funville?

268
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:07,924
You're forgetting,

269
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:11,984
I've done my fair share of drinking once upon a time.

270
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:15,650
In fact, I did your fair share, too.

271
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:19,028
I believe that you were attempting to quiet the voices in your head.

272
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,273
What's his excuse?

273
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,535
I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill.

274
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,334
Excuse me?

275
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,453
Have you seen the pile of empties next to your brother?

276
00:14:27,021 --> 00:14:31,363
I'm getting up early and taking all those bottles to the recycler so I can retire a wealthy man.

277
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:32,853
That's not nice.

278
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:35,628
He just got home.

279
00:14:36,412 --> 00:14:38,050
He's been through a lot.

280
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:39,694
They both have.

281
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,993
But he's alive.

282
00:14:42,202 --> 00:14:43,683
He's home. He's here.

283
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:46,181
And he's alive.

284
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,852
Hey, kid, you want to turn those down for me?

285
00:15:03,425 --> 00:15:06,767
Wow, you don't sleep in jammies?

286
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:10,239
Damn.

287
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:14,268
I knew I forgot to do something last night.

288
00:15:18,605 --> 00:15:19,990
Where is everybody?

289
00:15:20,992 --> 00:15:21,888
Where's your mom?

290
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:23,910
She's getting ready for work.

291
00:15:24,454 --> 00:15:26,056
Since when does she work?

292
00:15:27,515 --> 00:15:28,605
What does she do?

293
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,766
She's a guesser.

294
00:15:31,134 --> 00:15:32,461
For the State.

295
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:34,555
A "guesser."

296
00:15:36,663 --> 00:15:37,744
What's that?

297
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,723
Well, you tell your mother good morning for me

298
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:46,356
and tell her I wish her...

299
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,823
good guessing.

300
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:56,264
- Ready?
- One second.

301
00:15:57,381 --> 00:16:00,984
Oh, maybe you misunderstood. There's nothing to record. The woman's in a coma.

302
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:02,762
This isn't for her. This is for me.

303
00:16:02,812 --> 00:16:03,458
Excuse me?

304
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:06,647
Look, you see a hospital and you think "care, hope, life."

305
00:16:06,718 --> 00:16:07,805
And it is all of that.

306
00:16:07,953 --> 00:16:11,373
But I get within 100 feet of one of these places and every soul that's passed

307
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,145
within the last 24 hours and is still roaming the halls thinks,

308
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,755
"Oh, great, there's a medium on the floor."

309
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,714
"One last chance to tell Aunt Tilly that the will's in the closet."

310
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:22,064
Okay, but I still don't get...

311
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:25,637
When they realize I can't hear them, they tend to leave me alone.

312
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,308
I want to prepare you.

313
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:48,263
She's burned over 30 percent of her body.

314
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:49,685
Been in a coma for three weeks.

315
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:53,606
Her prognosis for survival is slim, but there's still plenty of brain wave activity.

316
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:55,277
Okay, I want to prepare you.

317
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,841
I've never tried to get something off of someone in a coma before.

318
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,217
- I mean, I'll do the best I can.
- That's all I'm asking.

319
00:17:36,745 --> 00:17:38,557
Would you like to hold her hand?

320
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:40,119
Oh? May I?

321
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,035
Sure.

322
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:56,140
Hey, how are you feeling?

323
00:17:58,935 --> 00:17:59,872
Wow.

324
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:05,375
I took her hand and suddenly everything just went black.

325
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,345
I don't know if it was fear or...

326
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:13,101
anger or some amazing kind of rage.

327
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:16,630
Well, I suppose I'd feel all that, too,

328
00:18:16,691 --> 00:18:20,116
if I knew that my spouse had tried to burn me and my child to death.

329
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:22,082
Did she see him?

330
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:24,309
Did she see anyone set that fire?

331
00:18:26,988 --> 00:18:28,334
That's what I'm trying to tell you,

332
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:32,650
all I saw, all she showed me was black.

333
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:35,031
I got to go get my kids.

334
00:18:36,296 --> 00:18:38,067
Who told you that? I didn't hear that.

335
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,609
Mike?

336
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,318
Michael, I'm home with the girls.

337
00:18:49,689 --> 00:18:51,912
You guys... here, take your sister, go change her.

338
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,597
- Go.
- Come on. Bridge, quick.

339
00:18:54,056 --> 00:18:54,964
Michael.

340
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:57,308
What are you watching?

341
00:19:21,323 --> 00:19:23,713
- Ally.
- I just brought the girls home from school.

342
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:25,366
Little Oral Annie?

343
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:28,254
I guess you were right,

344
00:19:28,966 --> 00:19:30,572
it's not a kid's movie.

345
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,266
Want a beer?

346
00:19:34,013 --> 00:19:34,977
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:36,713 --> 00:19:38,843
You sure you want to go into business with this numskull?

348
00:19:39,006 --> 00:19:40,527
What, are you kidding me?

349
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:43,041
See, I think you know your little brother, but I'm telling you, you don't.

350
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:46,021
This guy's a born leader. Now, our sergeant, he was in charge,

351
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:48,737
- but he wasn't the guy people listened to.
- Knock it off.

352
00:19:48,851 --> 00:19:50,941
He wasn't the guy whose word you depended on, you know what I'm saying?

353
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:54,787
- Tommy, leave it alone. 
- I'm not saying anything against the guy, God rest his soul.

354
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:57,556
I'm just saying that when the chips were down and the sides were taken,

355
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:59,190
- Tommy...
- I knew I could count on Lucky...

356
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:00,388
Hey! Tommy!

357
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,526
Shut up, man.

358
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:15,535
Got to drain the snake.

359
00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:16,382
Bridgette.

360
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,134
Come here, baby.

361
00:20:18,763 --> 00:20:21,283
Did you meet Tommy? This is Uncle Michael's friend, Tommy.

362
00:20:25,544 --> 00:20:26,823
At ease, soldier.

363
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:29,367
Hey, mister, did you ever kill someone?

364
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,274
Bridgette!

365
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,414
I'm sorry. She's in first grade...

366
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:33,802
Don't worry about it. That's okay.

367
00:20:33,924 --> 00:20:34,703
Come here, sweetie.

368
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:36,505
I'll tell you what.

369
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:38,394
I don't know.

370
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,320
I shot a few, I guess, but...

371
00:20:41,082 --> 00:20:43,074
that was only 'cause they were shooting at me.

372
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:52,798
Hey, you okay?

373
00:20:53,473 --> 00:20:55,845
I'm fine. I'm fine.

374
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:58,289
Bridgette, come on. Let's go do your homework.

375
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,346
Get rid of that.

376
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,902
He's a soldier, Allison.

377
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:03,449
Killing is what soldiers do.

378
00:21:03,627 --> 00:21:06,233
I mean, I actually thought the guy was sort of a positive influence.

379
00:21:06,324 --> 00:21:07,877
No. I know, I thought so, too.

380
00:21:07,953 --> 00:21:10,615
It's just there's something about the way that they are together.

381
00:21:11,297 --> 00:21:12,351
Wait. Shh!

382
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:16,555
Do you hear that? Is that the TV?

383
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,618
He's gonna wake the girls.

384
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:21,194
Allison, what are you talking about?

385
00:21:25,623 --> 00:21:26,468
Michael...?

386
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:28,235
Michael.

387
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:43,154
Hey, Sis.

388
00:21:43,865 --> 00:21:44,818
What's going on?

389
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,762
What do you mean?

390
00:21:48,422 --> 00:21:49,584
I heard a voice.

391
00:21:52,002 --> 00:21:53,484
I don't know what you're talking about.

392
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,110
A voice. A man's voice. And it wasn't your voice.

393
00:21:57,721 --> 00:22:00,280
And it was very agitated.

394
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:02,856
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

395
00:22:06,122 --> 00:22:07,443
I'm the only one in here.

396
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:09,327
Yeah...

397
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:15,298
Well, it sounded like he was talking to you.

398
00:22:17,874 --> 00:22:19,848
But if I'm the only one here...

399
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:22,286
Right.

400
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,153
Of course.

401
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:37,564
Sometimes this makes it easier to sleep.

402
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:41,543
You think so?

403
00:22:52,658 --> 00:22:56,103
Hmm, I'm feeling sleepier already.

404
00:22:58,664 --> 00:23:01,243
Now you want to get out of here so I can get some rest or what?

405
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:07,178
Right.

406
00:23:19,705 --> 00:23:20,761
I'll see you in the morning.

407
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,880
Would you like to see our school?

408
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:01,871
It was her idea.

409
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,021
One more time.

410
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,589
Soft...

411
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,005
slow.

412
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,520
Mom is driving us to school.

413
00:24:16,797 --> 00:24:18,281
Want to come?

414
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,943
That was nice of you to do that.

415
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,405
It meant a lot to the girls.

416
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:27,292
I got to pee so bad I can taste it.

417
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:30,006
I kind of like it.

418
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:35,100
Is that beer in Bridgette's cup?

419
00:24:35,925 --> 00:24:37,246
That's beer, isn't it?

420
00:24:43,426 --> 00:24:44,598
You got to be kidding me.

421
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,863
Get rid of it now.

422
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:48,351
Fine.

423
00:25:04,156 --> 00:25:05,620
Where are we headed, anyways?

424
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:08,432
One little stop-- something I have to do for work.

425
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:20,403
Wait. Did you do this?

426
00:25:21,115 --> 00:25:24,284
Kowabunga! You're a pyromaniac.

427
00:25:24,822 --> 00:25:26,122
Wait here a second, will you?

428
00:25:27,228 --> 00:25:28,364
Nice job, sis.

429
00:25:43,212 --> 00:25:45,024
I was hoping I would find you here.

430
00:25:45,408 --> 00:25:48,691
I wanted to ask you about that night, about the fire.

431
00:25:49,535 --> 00:25:52,233
I wanted to ask you if you maybe saw something.

432
00:25:52,496 --> 00:25:54,174
Maybe who might have set it.

433
00:25:58,363 --> 00:26:02,040
Honey... it's important that we know the truth.

434
00:26:02,551 --> 00:26:05,151
Even if the truth involves someone we love.

435
00:26:07,461 --> 00:26:09,237
I'm guessing you did see.

436
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,691
And I'm guessing it was someone you knew.

437
00:26:13,492 --> 00:26:14,761
Was it your father?

438
00:26:16,229 --> 00:26:19,764
- Hey! My teeth are floating...
- Diedre!

439
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:20,794
Diedre!

440
00:26:22,196 --> 00:26:22,883
Wait!

441
00:26:24,162 --> 00:26:25,068
Diedre!

442
00:26:26,755 --> 00:26:27,823
Diedre!

443
00:26:35,406 --> 00:26:36,061
Hey!

444
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,840
What are you doing?

445
00:26:40,121 --> 00:26:41,713
Trying not to wet my pants.

446
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:43,777
No. Who are you making faces at?

447
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:48,109
I'm not making faces; this is what I look like when my bladder's about to explode.

448
00:26:48,225 --> 00:26:49,593
You see her, don't you?

449
00:26:49,696 --> 00:26:51,385
- See who?
- That little girl.

450
00:26:51,447 --> 00:26:54,304
I'm guessing she's up in her room standing by the window?

451
00:26:56,178 --> 00:27:00,091
Hey... sis, there's nothing there.

452
00:27:00,171 --> 00:27:01,678
Don't play with me, Michael.

453
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,427
A little girl died in this house.

454
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,175
Her mother's still in a coma.

455
00:27:05,265 --> 00:27:07,717
And the fire that did it, it was intentionally set.

456
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,875
The police believe the husband was responsible,

457
00:27:09,997 --> 00:27:11,593
but they're having a hard time proving it.

458
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,174
Okay.

459
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:13,832
I work for the District Attorney's Office.

460
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:15,866
I help them with cases, difficult cases,

461
00:27:15,921 --> 00:27:18,389
cases that can't be solved by conventional means.

462
00:27:19,053 --> 00:27:21,374
I can see things that other people can't.

463
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:25,655
- You can "see" things?
- That's right.

464
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:31,035
Oh, so that's what the kid meant by a "guesser," huh?

465
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:33,887
So...

466
00:27:35,147 --> 00:27:37,133
how's my surf shop gonna do?

467
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:40,129
Oh, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

468
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:42,944
I... I guess I should take this more seriously.

469
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:45,213
You really don't want to have this conversation, huh, Michael?

470
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:46,313
What conversation?

471
00:27:46,397 --> 00:27:48,838
- You saw that little girl.
- I didn't see anything!

472
00:27:48,904 --> 00:27:51,356
And the other night you heard that man screaming at you.

473
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,482
What I have, you have.

474
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,611
What I have, you have.

475
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:56,989
That's really sweet.

476
00:27:57,086 --> 00:28:00,261
And, you know, if it were blue eyes or a weakness for fried foods, I'd be tickled.

477
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:02,795
But you know something, I have to draw the line at psychosis.

478
00:28:02,927 --> 00:28:04,172
You're on your own there, sis.

479
00:28:04,254 --> 00:28:05,939
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

480
00:28:06,175 --> 00:28:11,366
Michael, your nickname is "Lucky" because you can see things before they happen, right?

481
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,407
That must be a very valuable talent in a war zone.

482
00:28:14,608 --> 00:28:19,215
Sorry, sis, I've seen way too much real life to believe in any of this mumbo jumbo.

483
00:28:19,287 --> 00:28:20,060
Oh, really?

484
00:28:20,138 --> 00:28:22,138
Yeah. Really.

485
00:28:22,246 --> 00:28:23,480
You're half right.

486
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,246
I've said a couple things that turned out true,

487
00:28:26,311 --> 00:28:29,103
but that's not so hard when all someone's asking is,

488
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:31,550
"Are we gonna live or are we gonna die today?"

489
00:28:31,723 --> 00:28:33,038
You're bound to be half right--

490
00:28:33,131 --> 00:28:35,553
and if I'm wrong, there's not gonna be anyone around to prove it.

491
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,806
You want to know what I believe in?

492
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,772
I believe in percentages.

493
00:28:40,263 --> 00:28:42,338
Now, does that make me psychic?

494
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:44,155
Me?

495
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,428
I say the wife did it.

496
00:28:50,043 --> 00:28:53,494
And, hell, I got a 50/50 shot of being right.

497
00:28:57,712 --> 00:28:58,333
Yeah?

498
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,684
Specialists Lehane and Benoit requesting permission to enter, sir.

499
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:01,513
Come on in.

500
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:10,052
Hey, Sarge, uh, Lucky and me were wondering

501
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:11,588
if we could talk to you about those orders for tomorrow?

502
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:12,591
What about them?

503
00:29:13,155 --> 00:29:15,765
Well, sir, it seems that, uh, Lucky here has had...

504
00:29:15,868 --> 00:29:16,914
one of his feelings.

505
00:29:18,962 --> 00:29:20,972
You guys are kidding me with this stuff, right?

506
00:29:21,204 --> 00:29:21,935
No, sir.

507
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:23,517
This man's intoxicated.

508
00:29:25,227 --> 00:29:26,784
Hey, come on, man, pull yourself together.

509
00:29:26,862 --> 00:29:28,217
Tell the sergeant what you saw.

510
00:29:29,882 --> 00:29:31,514
Um, I don't know, Sarge,

511
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,294
we're standing in the middle of this Afghan village,

512
00:29:35,377 --> 00:29:37,511
and I'm talking to my sister...

513
00:29:37,588 --> 00:29:41,003
What? Your sister lives in an Afghan village?

514
00:29:41,162 --> 00:29:42,861
No, man, you're explaining it all wrong.

515
00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:45,585
We get to that village, 'kay?

516
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:50,276
Sometime during the day, the enemy's gonna start hitting us with mortars, all right?

517
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:51,994
And according to Lucky...

518
00:29:52,802 --> 00:29:54,116
none of us survive.

519
00:29:55,242 --> 00:29:55,949
Really?

520
00:29:56,574 --> 00:29:57,327
Yes, sir.

521
00:29:57,525 --> 00:29:58,759
But he doesn't look worried.

522
00:29:59,358 --> 00:30:00,547
You worried, soldier?

523
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:04,382
Is there somewhere that I could sit down?

524
00:30:04,522 --> 00:30:05,728
Oh, man. Come on.

525
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:14,985
Look, Sarge, I know he's a sloppy drunk, okay?

526
00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:17,309
But I've been with the guy eight months, and I'm telling you,

527
00:30:17,373 --> 00:30:19,293
when he tells you something's gonna to happen...

528
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:21,089
What are we talking about here, huh?

529
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:23,269
Winning card games? Flipping quarters?

530
00:30:24,453 --> 00:30:26,162
We're in a war here, mister.

531
00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:30,530
You seriously expect me to disobey or disregard an order because some alcoholic

532
00:30:30,598 --> 00:30:32,215
told you we're all gonna die?

533
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,989
That guy's a world-class screw-up.

534
00:30:35,281 --> 00:30:38,675
Been in this man's army eight years and can't rise above specialist.

535
00:30:38,947 --> 00:30:39,760
But you...

536
00:30:40,161 --> 00:30:41,858
you ain't barely been in a year--

537
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,918
you're going home in three weeks, brother--

538
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,758
and you'd risk a dishonorable 'cause along with pink elephants,

539
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:50,349
the town drunk here told you he saw a vision?

540
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:54,215
Get out of here before I throw your cowardly ass in the stockade.

541
00:30:58,977 --> 00:31:01,526
Sir, don't you think we could just maybe...

542
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:04,373
just get lost, you know, maybe... show up a day late?

543
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:06,599
And be sure and take your trash with you when you go.

544
00:31:10,732 --> 00:31:11,592
Yes, Sir.

545
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,925
Come on, man, get up!

546
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:18,449
Wait a second.

547
00:31:22,386 --> 00:31:23,896
Just arrived from H.Q.

548
00:31:24,095 --> 00:31:27,141
When we get where we're going tomorrow, you two lovebirds can make a tape,

549
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:29,923
let your families see that you cowards are safe and sound.

550
00:31:30,004 --> 00:31:33,358
- Now, get your asses out of here.
- Hey. Look at that.

551
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,790
I said get your sorry asses out of here.

552
00:31:35,867 --> 00:31:40,008
You two are the sorriest excuses for soldiers that I've ever had the misfortune of knowing,

553
00:31:40,095 --> 00:31:43,035
and let me tell you something, Mr. "why-don't-we-all-just-show-up-

554
00:31:43,092 --> 00:31:44,880
a-day-late-or-maybe-not-at-all..."

555
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:47,986
I'm pleading with you, soldier.

556
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:51,801
You can't let my little boy grow up thinking his daddy was a coward,

557
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,074
that his daddy killed himself.

558
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,551
You can't go to that memorial tomorrow

559
00:31:56,603 --> 00:31:59,859
and let those people walk away thinking I did this to myself.

560
00:32:00,144 --> 00:32:03,684
I did not spend 14 years serving my country

561
00:32:03,776 --> 00:32:08,881
to have all that I accomplished undone by a drunken clown and his cowardly friend!

562
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:12,591
Damn it, soldier, open your eyes!

563
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,945
Look at me.

564
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:27,676
You can see me, can't you?

565
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:31,583
And you can hear me, too.

566
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,390
It's 6:20 in the morning.

567
00:32:49,442 --> 00:32:50,281
You're up early.

568
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:54,888
Michael, that man's family thinks he killed himself.

569
00:32:55,596 --> 00:32:57,368
He was here last night.

570
00:32:57,956 --> 00:32:59,493
I spoke to him.

571
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:01,268
I know what happened.

572
00:33:01,658 --> 00:33:02,380
Really?

573
00:33:03,301 --> 00:33:05,632
Hey, Sis, you don't know anything,

574
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:08,785
and for that matter, neither do I,

575
00:33:09,313 --> 00:33:12,804
and for everybody's sake, I say we just leave it that way.

576
00:33:12,973 --> 00:33:14,570
You have to tell them the truth.

577
00:33:14,647 --> 00:33:15,482
The truth?

578
00:33:15,784 --> 00:33:18,610
The truth is, far all I know, he blew his brains out.

579
00:33:18,826 --> 00:33:22,967
The truth is, he was just as terrified of going on that mission as we were. The truth...

580
00:33:25,123 --> 00:33:27,417
I told him not to ring the bell.

581
00:33:29,086 --> 00:33:30,126
I'll get it.

582
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:37,493
He's in the kitchen.

583
00:33:38,406 --> 00:33:41,150
Tell him I'll be back in a minute. I'm going to go throw on some clothes.

584
00:33:45,403 --> 00:33:46,105
Hey.

585
00:33:47,102 --> 00:33:49,858
What's with your sister? She, uh... she's not a morning person, huh?

586
00:33:54,563 --> 00:33:56,386
You didn't tell her anything, did you?

587
00:33:56,731 --> 00:33:57,657
About what?

588
00:33:58,019 --> 00:33:58,818
Anything.

589
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:03,191
About what you know, about what a person might suspect.

590
00:34:04,031 --> 00:34:04,859
No.

591
00:34:06,483 --> 00:34:08,332
It's just hard lookin' her in the eye is all.

592
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:12,664
It's gonna be the same this morning with the sergeant's family, you know?

593
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:16,795
Uh, no, I don't know, Mike.

594
00:34:21,947 --> 00:34:22,913
You listen to me.

595
00:34:24,388 --> 00:34:29,231
Now, for all the times that we coulda ended up caught, or hurt, or dead,

596
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:33,291
but we came through because of whatever you dreamt, or what you saw?

597
00:34:33,732 --> 00:34:35,498
I owe you, okay?

598
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,712
But now you owe me,

599
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,630
'cause I'm saving your life.

600
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:44,924
Here. Right now.

601
00:34:46,505 --> 00:34:49,165
See, without this plan, without this business we're gonna do together--

602
00:34:49,412 --> 00:34:51,576
you have nothing, and you know it.

603
00:34:52,972 --> 00:34:55,584
You can't function, you can't hold down a job, you can't...

604
00:34:55,698 --> 00:34:58,016
you can't live like a normal person. Look at you.

605
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:00,007
Pathetic.

606
00:35:00,858 --> 00:35:01,621
You're right.

607
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:03,408
I owe you.

608
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:04,534
You're damn right.

609
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,043
So I'm changing the plan. I'm gonna go to the memorial by myself.

610
00:35:09,122 --> 00:35:13,392
You're gonna stay here, and after it's all done, then we'll... sunny California.

611
00:35:13,464 --> 00:35:16,842
No. Can't. I can't do that. I gotta go to the memorial.

612
00:35:16,924 --> 00:35:18,468
- No, no, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

613
00:35:18,544 --> 00:35:20,499
No. Now, listen to me.

614
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:22,189
That'll only mess you up, Mike.

615
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:28,639
Mike, you gotta... you gotta learn to stay away from the things that hurt you.

616
00:35:30,263 --> 00:35:32,710
I mean, what are you, a pain freak? Huh?

617
00:35:32,971 --> 00:35:35,152
You just wanna feel bad?

618
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:39,600
Now, come on.

619
00:35:39,935 --> 00:35:42,286
Come on. Sit down.

620
00:35:43,676 --> 00:35:46,974
I'll go to the memorial, pay our respects.

621
00:35:47,906 --> 00:35:51,362
And hey, don't... nobody's gonna think badly of you for not coming down there.

622
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:55,764
Just... everybody handles grief in their own way.

623
00:35:56,047 --> 00:35:56,825
Right?

624
00:35:57,773 --> 00:35:58,546
Okay.

625
00:35:59,565 --> 00:36:00,398
Hey.

626
00:36:09,022 --> 00:36:09,974
You need a beer?

627
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,085
No. I'm okay.

628
00:36:35,872 --> 00:36:37,150
I heard the front door.

629
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,463
Tommy left.

630
00:36:40,658 --> 00:36:42,511
He's gonna go without me. Um...

631
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:46,028
I don't know if I can handle it.

632
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,129
You're kidding yourself.

633
00:36:48,296 --> 00:36:50,631
You think skipping the funeral's going to put an end to it?

634
00:36:51,189 --> 00:36:51,984
Michael.

635
00:36:52,531 --> 00:36:56,351
There is not enough beer in the world to drown out what you know.

636
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:59,315
There aren't headphones tight enough. There isn't music loud enough.

637
00:36:59,381 --> 00:37:01,522
I don't know anything!

638
00:37:01,605 --> 00:37:03,080
That's a bunch of crap.

639
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:03,985
Michael!

640
00:37:04,215 --> 00:37:06,846
You told Tommy what was going to happen.

641
00:37:06,996 --> 00:37:08,795
You told him about your dream,

642
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,009
and when the sergeant wouldn't abort the mission,

643
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:12,884
Tommy killed him.

644
00:37:13,001 --> 00:37:14,795
- I don't know that.
- Oh, yeah, you do,

645
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:17,691
and so does your sergeant, and I am here to tell you,

646
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:20,492
the rest of your life is gonna be like A Christmas Carol,

647
00:37:20,563 --> 00:37:22,212
except without the happy ending.

648
00:37:22,376 --> 00:37:25,336
No, you just get to keep seeing ghosts at the end of your bed,

649
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,061
and you want to know why?

650
00:37:28,244 --> 00:37:30,071
Not cause you have a gift,

651
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:33,518
but because you have a conscience.

652
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:51,497
Excuse me, ma'am.

653
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:55,641
I just wanted to let you know that he was a good man, your husband.

654
00:37:56,997 --> 00:37:59,271
We were all very proud to serve with him.

655
00:38:00,004 --> 00:38:00,818
Thank you.

656
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:04,110
Save me a seat, will you?

657
00:38:10,102 --> 00:38:12,875
I thought we agreed you being here wasn't such a good idea.

658
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,320
I changed my mind.

659
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,635
Don't go doing something you'll regret.

660
00:38:18,855 --> 00:38:20,565
His family deserves to know the truth.

661
00:38:20,651 --> 00:38:22,701
The truth? I'll tell you the truth.

662
00:38:22,752 --> 00:38:26,740
The truth is, you, me and half the guys in there'd be dead right now if it wasn't for me--

663
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:29,485
if I hadn't had the guts to do what had to be done.

664
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:32,178
And u know what else? He wouldn't've made it either.

665
00:38:32,264 --> 00:38:33,995
Sarge was a goner no matter what happened.

666
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:37,168
So you tell me, what the hell difference does the truth make, huh?

667
00:38:37,297 --> 00:38:39,012
What difference does it make? Hey!

668
00:38:39,509 --> 00:38:41,844
You go in there, it's over. You hear me?

669
00:38:42,464 --> 00:38:44,137
Without me, you got nothing.

670
00:38:44,738 --> 00:38:47,092
No California, no surf shop.

671
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:49,627
All you got is a little couch to sleep on

672
00:38:49,693 --> 00:38:52,555
until your sister gets so sick of your sorry ass she throws you out.

673
00:38:54,553 --> 00:38:57,158
Yeah, now, you think about that, Michael. Hmm?

674
00:38:57,485 --> 00:39:01,412
You think about that long and hard before you go in there and do something stupid.

675
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,468
You're a loser, Michael.

676
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,918
You're a loser, and you always will be.

677
00:39:15,401 --> 00:39:17,981
You think this changes anything? Huh?

678
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,620
Makes you a hero?

679
00:39:20,843 --> 00:39:22,180
I'm no hero, Tommy.

680
00:39:23,957 --> 00:39:26,218
I'm just a guy I want to keep from going crazy.

681
00:39:53,373 --> 00:39:55,707
Better sit down. You're not gonna believe this.

682
00:39:56,198 --> 00:39:57,851
I'm at the hospital, right?

683
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,646
Please don't ask me to go down there. You know how that turned out.

684
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:01,768
No need.

685
00:40:02,022 --> 00:40:04,554
The wife regained consciousness. Just got her statement.

686
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:05,721
It turns out you were right.

687
00:40:05,911 --> 00:40:08,030
The husband was having an affair with his assistant.

688
00:40:08,122 --> 00:40:09,519
So he set the fire?

689
00:40:09,765 --> 00:40:11,465
You're stepping on my punch line.

690
00:40:12,403 --> 00:40:14,415
He tells her he wants out of the marriage.

691
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:16,734
Wife says fine, but she's taking the house and kid--

692
00:40:16,806 --> 00:40:19,919
only she didn't mean taking as in divorce-settlement taking.

693
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,470
She meant taking as in where-I'm-going-you-can't-follow taking.

694
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,039
So I gave the Army investigator your number.

695
00:40:29,121 --> 00:40:33,038
I mean, if they want to interview me again or they need me to testify.

696
00:40:33,124 --> 00:40:34,768
I told them you know where to find me.

697
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:38,167
Okay, but why go anywhere at all? I mean, what's in California for you now?

698
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:42,140
You mean since I outed my financial backer as a murderer?

699
00:40:42,868 --> 00:40:44,455
I really don't know.

700
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,323
I'll figure something out.

701
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:47,824
Well, figure it out here.

702
00:40:48,786 --> 00:40:51,756
"Here" is a nice place to visit.

703
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:55,033
"Here" is a good place to come back to.

704
00:40:55,602 --> 00:40:56,658
"There's..."

705
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,730
a good place to start again.

706
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:02,134
"There's" a good place to...

707
00:41:03,091 --> 00:41:03,958
be new.

708
00:41:05,211 --> 00:41:07,140
You better call me. Okay?

709
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:08,021
I promise.

710
00:41:12,769 --> 00:41:13,665
Allison.

711
00:41:15,256 --> 00:41:17,111
Next bus doesn't leave until tomorrow.

712
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,308
Okay.

713
00:41:21,717 --> 00:41:23,864
Hey! I almost forgot.

714
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:25,813
You were right.

715
00:41:26,147 --> 00:41:27,175
What else is new?

716
00:41:27,729 --> 00:41:28,589
About what?

717
00:41:28,713 --> 00:41:30,100
That house I took you to.

718
00:41:30,162 --> 00:41:31,036
The briquette?

719
00:41:32,124 --> 00:41:33,669
The wife started the fire.

720
00:41:33,928 --> 00:41:35,835
50-50 shot, just like I told you, right?

721
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:36,946
Just like you told me.

722
00:41:37,524 --> 00:41:38,322
- Love you.
- Love you.

723
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:41,487
See, I knew you were gonna say that.

724
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,520
I can see the future.

725
00:41:43,607 --> 00:41:46,197
I'm a human marvel.

726
00:42:27,347 --> 00:42:30,327
