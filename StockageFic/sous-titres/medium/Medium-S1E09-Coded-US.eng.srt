1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,377
Once upon a time, 
there was a beautiful young

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:03,587

maiden named Sara who lived

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,713

in a castle far, far away.

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,342
Every morning, 
young Sara would awaken

5
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:10,177
and set about 
cooking and cleaning

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,970
and taking care 
of the whole castle,

7
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,307
and every night, she'd 
sit by the castle window

8
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:19,186
and secretly dream of 
someday returning home.

9
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,522

You see, her real home lay

10
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,691

at the far end of the kingdom

11
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:27,444
where friendly 
dragons still roamed the earth

12
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,905
and rainbows appeared 
whether it rained or not,

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,616
but deep in her 
heart, young Sara knew she

14
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,910
would probably never 
again see her real home,

15
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:38,079
for the evil ogre 
who held her captive,

16
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:41,291
whose castle she 
cleaned, whose food she made,

17
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,835
had vowed that if she 
ever tried to escape...

18
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,965
he, himself 
would come after her.

19
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,552
And he swore that no 
matter how fast she ran...

20
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,139

or how well she hid,

21
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,891

he would find her...

22
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,851

and kill her.

23
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,020

Mom?!

24
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,354

Mom!

25
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,695
- And there was 
this dragon, and this

26
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:54,238
rainbow. 
- What's your day look like?

27
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,990
Mom? Are you 
even listening to me?

28
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,075

Just a second.

29
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,452

Once I drop the kids off at

30
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:00,870
school, I'm 
heading to work. Why?

31
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:02,288
I was just 
wondering if you'd be

32
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:03,914
anywhere near the 
cleaners, that's all.

33
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,708
- Drop off or pickup? 
- Mom!

34
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,501
Pick up. I'm 
out of clean shirts.

35
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,586

- Mom

36
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,712
- What? What is it? 
- I'm

37
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:10,880

trying to tell you about...

38
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:12,465
I know-- your 
dream and I'm listening.

39
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:14,800
- No, you're not. 
- Yes. I am.

40
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,635

So can you do it, or should I?

41
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,137
- I can do it. 
- Are you sure?

42
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,805
Because I'm totally 
out of clean shirts.

43
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,599
Heard it. Got 
it. No clean shirts.

44
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:22,683

- Thank you

45
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:24,560
You know, if you're 
really worried about it,

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,270
maybe you should 
take care of it yourself.

47
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:30,482
This is completely 
unfair! I had her first, Dad!

48
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:31,901

No. In point of fact, I

49
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:33,235

did, or you wouldn't be here.

50
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,070

You know, I would, but the dry

51
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:36,947
cleaners is totally 
in the opposite direction

52
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,991
from my work, and it's 
right on the way to yours.

53
00:02:39,074 --> 00:02:40,409

Yeah, I know, that's why I

54
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:41,785

was thinking of changing jobs.

55
00:02:41,785 --> 00:02:43,162
It's no 
trouble, I'll get them.

56
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:44,246

- Thank you

57
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,624
Okay. That's it. I'm 
resigning from this family.

58
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:51,086
I had a dream, too. 
It was about animals.

59
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:54,381
They were 
eating people. For fun.

60
00:02:54,798 --> 00:02:56,300

Honey, okay, there's no

61
00:02:56,383 --> 00:02:57,885

need to resign. I'm all yours.

62
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,262
And that sounds like a 
terrible dream, sweetie.

63
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:02,764
Mother, you are not 
listening to me at all.

64
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:04,474

Yes, I am. I am listening

65
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:06,059

to you and everybody else,

66
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:07,686
but what I'm 
really worried about is

67
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,479
we're not going to 
get out of here on time,

68
00:03:09,563 --> 00:03:10,981
and if we don't 
get out of here on

69
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:12,733
time, you're going 
to miss your field trip

70
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:14,151

to the Native American Museum,

71
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:15,694
and we wouldn't 
want that, would we?

72
00:03:15,777 --> 00:03:16,778

Fine.

73
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:19,239
Don't forget to let me 
sign that permission slip.

74
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:20,866

I don't care.

75
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:23,035

I don't care about anything!

76
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:24,619

I care, Mom.

77
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:28,790

Hey, you. Hey!

78
00:03:29,624 --> 00:03:31,376

Hey, it's a dream. This

79
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,044

is real life. Now let's go.

80
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,296

Wow. Send that to

81
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,630
Ripley. He 
wouldn't believe it.

82
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:46,558
All ashore 
that's going ashore.

83
00:03:47,475 --> 00:03:48,476

Love you, Mom.

84
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:50,103

I love you, wild thing.

85
00:03:51,271 --> 00:03:52,272

Ariel?

86
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:55,442

Why don't you believe me?

87
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:57,402

But I do believe you.

88
00:03:57,694 --> 00:03:58,862

You had a dream.

89
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:01,531

But you're awake now.

90
00:04:02,115 --> 00:04:04,242
There's no 
castle, there's no ogre.

91
00:04:06,953 --> 00:04:09,330
So you're telling me 
it doesn't mean anything.

92
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:11,624

I have no way of knowing that.

93
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,126

It's just...

94
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:15,336

Most dreams...

95
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:18,840
Most dreams 
don't mean anything.

96
00:04:19,924 --> 00:04:21,676

Once in a great while, certain

97
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,428
people will 
have a dream, and...

98
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,431
and then when they're 
awake, they'll see things

99
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:28,641
in their life that 
remind them of their dream.

100
00:04:29,017 --> 00:04:30,810

Has that ever happened to you?

101
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:33,021

Sure, once in a while, I'll...

102
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:34,772

I'll dream something, and...

103
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:37,066

it'll puzzle me.

104
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:40,194
And then I'll either 
realize that it's nothing,

105
00:04:40,737 --> 00:04:43,656
or I'll start seeing 
things in my life that

106
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,576
tell me this is a 
dream I shouldn't ignore.

107
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,578
This is a dream 
that's important.

108
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,621

Really?

109
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:54,041

Really, but it's very rare.

110
00:04:55,793 --> 00:04:56,794

Now go.

111
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:58,462

I love you, Mom.

112
00:04:58,671 --> 00:04:59,922

I love you, kitten.

113
00:05:04,594 --> 00:05:05,886

Bye, baby.

114
00:05:07,388 --> 00:05:09,640
Okay, gang, we're 
only a couple of blocks

115
00:05:09,724 --> 00:05:11,892
from the Native 
American History Museum.

116
00:05:12,977 --> 00:05:14,562

Now let's go over the rules.

117
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:17,189

The most important thing is

118
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:18,774

that everybody stay together.

119
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:21,235

Do not wander off on your own.

120
00:05:21,318 --> 00:05:23,028

Once upon a time, there was a

121
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:24,738
beautiful young 
maiden named Sara

122
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,533
who lived in a 
castle far, far away.

123
00:05:33,873 --> 00:05:35,749
All right, 
everybody, let's go.

124
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,752
Quickly and 
quietly. Follow me.

125
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:42,214
Take 
everything off the bus. Do

126
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:44,133
not leave your 
possessions behind.

127
00:05:44,216 --> 00:05:45,217

Come on.

128
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:49,263

Come on. Honey, you're gonna

129
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:50,806
need that jacket. 
It's still chilly.

130
00:05:51,056 --> 00:05:53,017

Okay, let's move out.

131
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,791

D amn!

132
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:29,094
- As soon as you 
can, and I mean first

133
00:06:29,177 --> 00:06:30,721
thing in the morning. 
- Sorry I'm late.

134
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:31,972

Did they get you on the cell?

135
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:33,306

What? Who? I was in the

136
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,850
parking structure 
and the elevator...

137
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:35,934

Call the school.

138
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:46,778
This is a dream 
that I shouldn't ignore.

139
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,072
This is a dream 
that's important.

140
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:53,368

Hey! Watch it!

141
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,791
But deep in her 
heart, young Sara knew she

142
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:02,043
would probably never 
again see her real home.

143
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:09,342

How come you're standing on my

144
00:07:09,426 --> 00:07:11,219
property and just 
staring at my house?

145
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,388

This  is your house?

146
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:16,182

How come you're not in school?

147
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:18,268

How come you're not in school?

148
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:19,602

I'm home-schooled.

149
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:21,187
My mom took me 
out two years ago.

150
00:07:22,397 --> 00:07:24,148

It sucks, and I hate it.

151
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:26,317

What's your excuse?

152
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,279

So why aren't you in school?

153
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:33,116
Uh, I'm, uh, 
looking for somebody.

154
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:35,076

A... a girl.

155
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:36,202

What girl?

156
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:39,622

Uh, Sara.

157
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:42,667
I think that's 
what her name is. Sara.

158
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:46,129

That's my sister's name.

159
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:01,352

Okay, here's her most recent

160
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:02,854
school picture. 
I have another one.

161
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:07,233

Oh, my God.

162
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,776

Are you all right?

163
00:08:09,443 --> 00:08:11,862
Did somebody hurt you? 
Did somebody touch you?

164
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:12,947

Are you okay?

165
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:15,866
Nobody touched me, 
nobody hurt me. I'm fine.

166
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:16,909

You're fine?

167
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,953

Where did you go?

168
00:08:19,078 --> 00:08:21,288
Don't you ever 
do that again. Do

169
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:23,457
you have any 
idea how upset I was?

170
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,209

And Daddy was, and Mrs.

171
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,836

Lockhart? And the principal?

172
00:08:27,336 --> 00:08:30,339
I'm sorry. I'm 
really, really sorry.

173
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:36,303

I don't understand.

174
00:08:36,387 --> 00:08:38,097
You told me that if 
I ever saw something

175
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,765
in my life that 
reminded me of my dream,

176
00:08:39,765 --> 00:08:40,766

then it's probably a

177
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,059

dream that I shouldn't ignore.

178
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:44,770

That's the dragon. That's him.

179
00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:46,981
I saw him from 
the bus, and I just

180
00:08:47,022 --> 00:08:48,941
knew I was 
supposed to come back here.

181
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:51,694

Okay, I know. I got it, okay?

182
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,529
But you know 
there's a lot of reasons why

183
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:55,197
you could have 
dreamt about this dragon.

184
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,032
Maybe you passed 
this advertisement.

185
00:08:57,116 --> 00:08:58,909
Maybe you saw 
it in a magazine.

186
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:00,869

Maybe it got stuck in your

187
00:09:00,953 --> 00:09:01,954

subconscious, and that's

188
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:03,038

why you dreamt about it.

189
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:04,248

That can happen, you know.

190
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:06,125
Okay. Then what 
about the house?

191
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,209

What house?

192
00:09:08,335 --> 00:09:09,336

See?

193
00:09:09,503 --> 00:09:10,504

She lives here.

194
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:12,464

Lived here.

195
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:14,633
I'm confused. I 
thought you said that you

196
00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:16,677
were the girl in the 
dream trapped in the castle.

197
00:09:17,594 --> 00:09:20,847

It was me, but... it wasn't.

198
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:24,893

My name in the story was Sara.

199
00:09:24,977 --> 00:09:26,103

And you're telling me that

200
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:27,271

the real Sara lives here?

201
00:09:27,354 --> 00:09:28,355

This is her home?

202
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,649

That's what her brother said.

203
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:34,027

What else did her brother say?

204
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:37,614
That she died 
two years ago, and

205
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:39,825
that I was mean 
to ask him about her.

206
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:42,869

Oh, baby.

207
00:09:44,996 --> 00:09:46,289

Mommy,

208
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,543

why am I dreaming about a

209
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:51,545
dead girl that 
I don't even know?

210
00:09:58,635 --> 00:10:01,596
So am I really grounded 
for the rest of my life?

211
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:02,806

I don't know.

212
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,101
So you do understand 
how ridiculously dangerous

213
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:08,728
it is to trick your 
teachers and your class and...

214
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,814

Yes, yes, yes, yes.

215
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:12,315

Okay then. All right.

216
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,109

So maybe we'll reduce your

217
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:15,860
sentence by a 
couple of years or so.

218
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:18,863
I have to talk to 
your father first.

219
00:10:19,364 --> 00:10:21,991
So in the meantime, 
let's get some rest.

220
00:10:24,244 --> 00:10:25,954

I don't want go to sleep.

221
00:10:27,413 --> 00:10:29,457
I'm afraid of 
what I might dream.

222
00:10:29,582 --> 00:10:30,917

You're in Mommy's bed.

223
00:10:31,251 --> 00:10:33,586
Nothing bad can 
happen in Mommy's bed.

224
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:34,712

Hey, honey.

225
00:10:34,963 --> 00:10:36,965
That visitor you 
were expecting is here.

226
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:38,299

Is everybody else asleep?

227
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:39,467

Marie's in her crib and

228
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,718

Bridgette's out like a light.

229
00:10:41,177 --> 00:10:42,178

Okay.

230
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:45,515
You're not going 
to leave me, are you?

231
00:10:45,556 --> 00:10:46,891

Just for a little while.

232
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:49,435
Then I'm going to 
get into bed next to you

233
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,188
and we're going to 
dream happy dreams together.

234
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:55,983

Love you.

235
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:57,401

Love you, too.

236
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:12,166
You know I normally 
don't make house calls, but...

237
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,417

Thank you so much for doing

238
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:14,669

this. I really appreciate it.

239
00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:15,836

Well, I heard the panic in

240
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,004

your voice when you called.

241
00:11:17,088 --> 00:11:18,798
By the way, I 
asked a friend to

242
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:20,508
join us. I 
hope you don't mind.

243
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,511
I got a video. 
You got any popcorn?

244
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:30,810

Oh, I remember this.

245
00:11:31,894 --> 00:11:33,145

I saw this on the news.

246
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:41,904
After you called, I 
ran a check on every

247
00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:43,948
"Sara" between the 
ages of eight and 12

248
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:46,158
reported missing 
or murdered within

249
00:11:46,242 --> 00:11:48,244
100 miles of here 
in the last five years.

250
00:11:48,494 --> 00:11:50,162

Once you subtract the

251
00:11:50,246 --> 00:11:51,872
custody-nappings 
and the false alarms,

252
00:11:52,122 --> 00:11:53,624

the one case you're really

253
00:11:53,707 --> 00:11:55,167

left with is Sara Crewson,

254
00:11:55,376 --> 00:11:56,710

a case Detective Scanlon

255
00:11:56,794 --> 00:11:58,087

here helped investigate.

256
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,213

Halloween night, two

257
00:11:59,296 --> 00:12:00,506

years ago, Sara Crewson is out

258
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:01,924
with a group of 
friends trick or

259
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:03,425
treating, 
decides to go home early.

260
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:05,344
A man named, 
uh, Darrell Yellen,

261
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:07,137
convicted child 
molester, grabbed her

262
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:08,847
as  she was cutting 
through a convenience

263
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:10,641
store parking lot two 
blocks from her house.

264
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:12,476
The security 
camera's got the whole thing.

265
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,144

Yeah, I remember this case.

266
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:15,604

Cops caught him two days

267
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:16,855

later on the run to Mexico.

268
00:12:16,897 --> 00:12:18,982

He confessed to raping and

269
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:21,109
murdering Sara, 
along with two other girls.

270
00:12:21,443 --> 00:12:23,403
In exchange for 
his confession, and for

271
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:25,364
telling the police 
where to find the bodies,

272
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:28,075
we took the death 
penalty off the table.

273
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:30,869
Yellen's serving a life 
sentence in Springville.

274
00:12:30,953 --> 00:12:33,872
I know, 
because I cut the deal.

275
00:12:35,082 --> 00:12:37,459
Do you mind if I ask 
what's all this about?

276
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:38,877

Why this sudden fascination

277
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,295

with young girls named "Sara"?

278
00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:47,177

No, that's okay.

279
00:12:47,385 --> 00:12:49,346

I just had a dream.

280
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:50,722

I'm not sure what it means, or

281
00:12:50,806 --> 00:12:52,140
if it even 
means anything at all.

282
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:01,233

Your dream?

283
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:03,109
I didn't know 
what else to say.

284
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:05,695

Well, for the record, and

285
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:07,280

nobody asked, I hate this.

286
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:08,365

You hate what?

287
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:10,700
I hate that when my 
little girl has a bad dream

288
00:13:10,784 --> 00:13:12,911
I can't just give her a 
hug and a piece of cake.

289
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:15,330
I have to expect visits 
from the cops and the D.A.

290
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:16,831

What did you want me to do?

291
00:13:16,915 --> 00:13:18,041

- I had to see if there

292
00:13:18,124 --> 00:13:19,209
was something to it. 
- Why?

293
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:21,753
Because she thinks 
there's something to it.

294
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:24,089

Look, all over the world, kids

295
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:25,590
have dreams 
about the boogeyman,

296
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:27,425
and all over the 
world, parents tell

297
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:29,219
them it's going to 
be okay in the morning.

298
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:30,678
Well, our kids 
aren't like other

299
00:13:30,762 --> 00:13:32,222
kids. And I know 
you hate that, too.

300
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:34,474
I didn't say 
that. It's just... God.

301
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:36,601
There's enough 
death and darkness out

302
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:38,686
there waiting for 
her when she's an adult.

303
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,480
She's ten, for 
crying out loud.

304
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:43,233
It's one 
night. It's one dream.

305
00:13:43,316 --> 00:13:45,652
It could pass. 
She's still young.

306
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:47,278

I give you my word. I'm not

307
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:48,863
putting her in the 
middle of all this.

308
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:50,448

As far as everyone is

309
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:51,949
concerned, it's 
me, it's my dream.

310
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:53,868
So if we need 
to get the District

311
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:55,745
Attorney's office 
and the police involved,

312
00:13:55,828 --> 00:13:58,289
they'll think it's 
me. Let them deal with me.

313
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,041

Okay?

314
00:14:32,865 --> 00:14:35,618
What are you doing? 
It's the middle of the night.

315
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:36,994
Do you want to 
wake everyone up?

316
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,792
You have the 
coolest house. If I

317
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,376
had this much 
food in my house,

318
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,504

I would do nothing but eat and

319
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:48,589
watch TV all 
day and all night.

320
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:51,550
I want to check 
out your room. I

321
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:53,135
want to check 
out your clothes.

322
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,428

Wait, you can't go in there.

323
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:56,513

My sister's sleeping in there.

324
00:15:02,853 --> 00:15:05,564
I want this, 
and this and this.

325
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,274

Those are mine. You can't

326
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:08,609
have that. You 
can't take that.

327
00:15:08,692 --> 00:15:09,860

What gives you the right?

328
00:15:10,402 --> 00:15:12,821

What gives me the right?

329
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:17,993
I came to you, I 
asked you for your help,

330
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:20,287

and you didn't do anything.

331
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,247
That's what 
gives me the right.

332
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:33,008
You okay, sweetie? Did 
you have another bad dream?

333
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:35,761

I don't know.

334
00:15:36,345 --> 00:15:37,638

She's mad, Mommy.

335
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,848
She's mad that I 
haven't helped her.

336
00:15:40,182 --> 00:15:42,059

Oh, she's not mad at you,

337
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,894

sweetie. How could she be?

338
00:15:43,935 --> 00:15:45,103

How do you know?

339
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:48,648

Well, it has to do with the

340
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:50,400
kind of dream 
that you're having.

341
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:54,404
It's really 
just Sara remembering

342
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:56,740
something that 
happened when she was alive.

343
00:15:57,115 --> 00:15:58,742

And she's trying to tell you

344
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:00,410
about it, but 
she's telling you

345
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,330

in a kind of code.

346
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:04,706

What do you mean?

347
00:16:05,081 --> 00:16:08,835
Like that dragon was 
really that billboard.

348
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:11,129

And the castle is

349
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:12,714
probably just a 
house somewhere.

350
00:16:13,882 --> 00:16:15,675

And I'm guessing that the

351
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,510
monster was 
really this bad man

352
00:16:18,094 --> 00:16:19,846

that I found out about who

353
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:21,556
took Sara away 
from her family.

354
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:23,808

It's okay, sweetie.

355
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,310

He's in prison.

356
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:27,187

He's locked up where he can

357
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,980

never hurt anyone ever again.

358
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:32,317

Again? What do you mean again?

359
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,486
Well, it's like 
her brother told you.

360
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:39,407

Sara has passed on.

361
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:42,327

And where she is, no one

362
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,829

can hurt her. Not any more.

363
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:48,666
No, I don't think 
that's right, Mommy.

364
00:16:51,002 --> 00:16:53,212

What do you mean? Why not?

365
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:56,299
Because I don't 
think Sara is dead.

366
00:16:57,467 --> 00:16:59,135

I think she's alive.

367
00:17:00,303 --> 00:17:02,472

And she really wants my help.

368
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:05,558

So there's no question in

369
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,642

your mind that it was him?

370
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,102

Allison, he confessed.

371
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:10,146
What was this 
dream you had anyway?

372
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,064
It's nothing, I 
just... I'm worried

373
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:13,941
that this Crewson 
girl might need our help.

374
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:15,818
Again, as part of 
his confession, Darrell

375
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,778
Yellen told the police 
where to find the bodies.

376
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:19,197
He took us 
right to them. It was

377
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,531
all part of 
the plea agreement.

378
00:17:20,615 --> 00:17:22,325

Okay, you took him out

379
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,993

there, you found her, you...

380
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,954

You did find her, right?

381
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,874
Her clothes? Her 
bones? Something?

382
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,627

Actually, we found the partial

383
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,754
remains of his 
first two victims, um,

384
00:17:35,963 --> 00:17:37,923
Mindy Atwater 
and Elizabeth Cale.

385
00:17:37,965 --> 00:17:40,509
But now that 
you mention it, no.

386
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:41,844

No physical remains of the

387
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,304
Crewson girl 
were ever discovered.

388
00:17:43,387 --> 00:17:45,723
It was the assumption 
that an animal probably...

389
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:47,850
Oh, my God, she might 
still be alive somewhere?

390
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,268

Hang on.

391
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:50,978
Let's think about 
this for a minute.

392
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,272

Why would this man confess

393
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:54,982

to a crime he didn't commit?

394
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,234
I don't know, maybe 
someone should ask him.

395
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:11,415

My name's Allison Dubois. I'm

396
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:12,958
with the District 
Attorney's office.

397
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,335

I need to ask you some

398
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:16,962

questions about Sara Crewson.

399
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:19,506

Do you remember Sara Crewson?

400
00:18:20,674 --> 00:18:21,675

Of course.

401
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,265
Okay, so take me 
through it. Um...

402
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:32,728
you  snatched 
her on Halloween.

403
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:36,148
And then how long 
until you killed her?

404
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:39,568

The next day.

405
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,071

They had that videotape of me

406
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,157
in the parking 
lot on the news.

407
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,576
I knew it was only a 
matter of time, so...

408
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:52,039

I took her out to the desert.

409
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:54,082

And?

410
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:57,669

I killed her.

411
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,560

That it?

412
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:16,730

We done?

413
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:19,482

Anything else?

414
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,158

That's plenty. Thanks.

415
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:35,457

One night when the ogre wasn't

416
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,500
looking, Sara 
made a break for it.

417
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,212

And just when she was

418
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:44,007
certain she was 
safe, there he was.

419
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:01,691
I just don't 
believe it happened the

420
00:20:01,774 --> 00:20:03,234
way he said it 
did. I just, I don't.

421
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:05,611

- Why do you think he

422
00:20:05,695 --> 00:20:06,946
confessed? 
- Because he did it.

423
00:20:07,155 --> 00:20:10,032
Because he wanted to 
live. He made a deal.

424
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:11,659
Confessing 
meant life in prison

425
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:13,161

instead of death by injection.

426
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:17,290
I'm really 
struggling with trying to

427
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:19,208
understand what 
your position is here.

428
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,294
Are you trying to 
tell me that you think

429
00:20:21,377 --> 00:20:23,171
this man confessed to 
something he didn't do?

430
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:24,505

I sat with him yesterday.

431
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:25,798

I looked him in the eye.

432
00:20:25,882 --> 00:20:27,550

And I'm here to tell you,

433
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:29,218

Sara Crewson is still alive.

434
00:20:29,302 --> 00:20:30,886
She was abducted 
over two years ago.

435
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,513

I don't care. He gave her to

436
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:34,098
someone. He 
made a gift of her.

437
00:20:34,181 --> 00:20:36,309
- She's still out there. 
- He told you that?

438
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:37,852

No. He told me what he told

439
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:39,270

you. He told me he killed her.

440
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:42,815
Okay, you and I have a 
history. You tell me that

441
00:20:42,898 --> 00:20:45,317
this girl is alive, 
I'm tempted to believe you.

442
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:48,487
Where is she? 
We'll go pick her up.

443
00:20:50,322 --> 00:20:51,323

I don't know.

444
00:20:51,365 --> 00:20:53,826
Then what is it 
that you'd like me to do?

445
00:20:54,034 --> 00:20:56,120
Assuming what 
you're saying is true, this

446
00:20:56,203 --> 00:20:58,205
little girl could be 
anywhere in the world.

447
00:20:58,581 --> 00:20:59,999

Darrell Yellen is already in

448
00:21:00,082 --> 00:21:01,417
prison for the 
rest of his life.

449
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,960

How would you have me compel

450
00:21:03,043 --> 00:21:04,420

him to tell us where she is...

451
00:21:04,503 --> 00:21:06,088

assuming that he even knows?

452
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,508
Frankly, your 
theory doesn't make

453
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:11,385
much sense, 
Allison. Think about it.

454
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,846
Let's say Sara 
was alive and let's

455
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:16,140
say he actually did 
give her to someone.

456
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:17,266

Why didn't he share that

457
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:18,392

with us when he confessed?

458
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,102
I mean, he was 
trying to make a deal.

459
00:21:20,185 --> 00:21:21,520

Why didn't he use her safe

460
00:21:21,603 --> 00:21:22,896

return for a bargaining chip?

461
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,607
Instead of life 
without parole, insist

462
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:28,277
on the possibility 
of parole in 50 years.

463
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,361

Something.

464
00:21:29,903 --> 00:21:31,363
- Or... 
- Or?

465
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:34,700
Or Darrell Yellen 
chose not to use his trump

466
00:21:34,783 --> 00:21:36,994
card because whoever he 
gave that little girl to

467
00:21:37,077 --> 00:21:38,620

was more important to him than

468
00:21:38,662 --> 00:21:40,122

the dim possibility of parole.

469
00:21:40,205 --> 00:21:41,206

Allison...

470
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,625
I mean, think 
about it, we find

471
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:45,961
this important 
person, we find Sara.

472
00:21:48,088 --> 00:21:49,089

Excuse me.

473
00:21:52,926 --> 00:21:53,927

Hello?

474
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,555

Yes. This is her mother.

475
00:21:58,098 --> 00:21:59,182

I'll be right there.

476
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:14,197

I'm sorry.

477
00:22:14,406 --> 00:22:16,157

Don't apologize if you haven't

478
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:17,909
done something 
to be sorry for.

479
00:22:18,743 --> 00:22:20,453
You want to tell 
me what happened?

480
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:23,206

I was in the library,

481
00:22:24,082 --> 00:22:25,709

and I fell asleep.

482
00:22:29,963 --> 00:22:32,257

And I had another dream.

483
00:22:34,384 --> 00:22:36,219

And I woke up screaming.

484
00:22:39,013 --> 00:22:41,641

Why did Sara choose me?

485
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:44,811
I mean, why is 
she talking to me?

486
00:22:45,478 --> 00:22:48,606
Maybe because she 
knew that you would listen.

487
00:22:54,112 --> 00:22:55,280

Hey, what you doing?

488
00:22:56,573 --> 00:22:58,449
You were supposed to 
come to bed an hour ago.

489
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,994
I know. I 
just... keep thinking

490
00:23:01,077 --> 00:23:03,329
that the answer 
is in here somewhere.

491
00:23:04,747 --> 00:23:07,208
You know, this crime 
solving thing is much

492
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,585
harder when it isn't 
you having the dream.

493
00:23:10,878 --> 00:23:12,880

Why is everyone awake?

494
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:15,174
Sweetie, did you 
have another bad dream?

495
00:23:18,094 --> 00:23:19,429

Good. I'm glad you're not

496
00:23:19,512 --> 00:23:20,805

having those spooky dreams.

497
00:23:20,888 --> 00:23:22,515

I'm not having the dreams

498
00:23:22,598 --> 00:23:24,142
because I'm 
trying to stay awake.

499
00:23:24,225 --> 00:23:25,852

But, honey, that's why

500
00:23:25,935 --> 00:23:27,478
you're falling 
asleep at school.

501
00:23:30,982 --> 00:23:31,983

Mommy?

502
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:34,735
Why do you have a 
picture of the ogre?

503
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,070

What are you talking about?

504
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:39,907

This man? Is he the evil ogre?

505
00:24:10,354 --> 00:24:13,023

Sara, it's Wednesday.

506
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:21,740

Come on.

507
00:24:21,865 --> 00:24:22,866

I got to go.

508
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,952

Can't I stay out here?

509
00:24:26,036 --> 00:24:28,080
I won't go 
anywhere, I promise.

510
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,165

You know Darrell's rules. I

511
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:31,750

can't go till you're in there.

512
00:24:35,712 --> 00:24:37,881

Can I take the castle with me?

513
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:42,010
- Can I play with the castle? 
- Sara, stop it!

514
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:46,390
No. It-It's dark in 
the closet. You know that.

515
00:24:46,723 --> 00:24:50,352
Now... and no, 
this is my castle.

516
00:25:04,658 --> 00:25:06,868

Do you want candy?

517
00:25:08,787 --> 00:25:10,622

I'll bring you candy?

518
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:14,209

Thank you.

519
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:23,176

Henry Yellen is Darrell

520
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,261

Yellen's older brother.

521
00:25:24,594 --> 00:25:25,804

When he was 18 months old, he

522
00:25:25,887 --> 00:25:27,180
had a fever, 
and no one noticed.

523
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:29,349
Went to his brain, and 
he's been, I don't know,

524
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:31,476
slow ever since, but 
he's got no criminal record.

525
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:32,936

And there is certainly nothing

526
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:34,354
to suggest that 
he's a pedophile.

527
00:25:34,354 --> 00:25:35,605

How'd he get that scar?

528
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,273

Ah. When they were kids, the

529
00:25:37,357 --> 00:25:38,900
father went after 
Darrell with a knife.

530
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,151

Henry wanted to protect his

531
00:25:40,235 --> 00:25:41,695
younger brother 
and got between them.

532
00:25:41,778 --> 00:25:42,779

God.

533
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:45,240
Father went to prison, 
died there two years later.

534
00:25:45,323 --> 00:25:47,784
Darrell's pretty much 
taken total responsibility

535
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:48,993

for Henry ever since their

536
00:25:49,077 --> 00:25:50,203

mother passed away in '98.

537
00:25:50,286 --> 00:25:51,788
So what are you 
saying? You think

538
00:25:51,871 --> 00:25:53,373
that Darrell gave 
Sara to his brother?

539
00:25:53,748 --> 00:25:55,041

You're the one who said

540
00:25:55,124 --> 00:25:56,292

that whoever he gave her to

541
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:57,502

was even more important

542
00:25:57,585 --> 00:25:58,837
than the 
possibility of parole.

543
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,631
Henry's his blood. 
Henry saved his life.

544
00:26:01,673 --> 00:26:03,341

And apparently he does

545
00:26:03,424 --> 00:26:05,051

need a certain level of care.

546
00:26:06,344 --> 00:26:07,845
Perhaps when 
Darrell realized he was

547
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:09,430
going to prison 
for a long, long time,

548
00:26:09,514 --> 00:26:10,890

he made arrangements for

549
00:26:10,974 --> 00:26:12,392
someone else to 
take care of Henry.

550
00:26:12,475 --> 00:26:13,851

So what are we doing here? Why

551
00:26:13,935 --> 00:26:15,353
aren't we out 
looking for this guy?

552
00:26:15,436 --> 00:26:17,313
To start with, we 
don't know where to find him.

553
00:26:17,397 --> 00:26:18,606

When their mother died,

554
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,941
Henry was the 
sole beneficiary,

555
00:26:20,024 --> 00:26:22,235
and he's lived off the 
life insurance ever since.

556
00:26:22,318 --> 00:26:24,237
No credit cards. 
No driver's license.

557
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,322
No property in his 
name. No taxes filed.

558
00:26:26,405 --> 00:26:27,490

Henry Yellen is

559
00:26:27,573 --> 00:26:28,950
untraceable. He 
could be anywhere.

560
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:32,036
In fact, the only person 
we know who's seen him...

561
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:34,580

is you... in your dreams.

562
00:26:34,664 --> 00:26:36,374
Is there 
anything you can tell us

563
00:26:36,457 --> 00:26:38,084
to begin? A 
place to start to look?

564
00:26:42,421 --> 00:26:44,632
Actually, 
it-it's not my dream.

565
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,051

Excuse me?

566
00:26:48,594 --> 00:26:50,304

It's someone else's dream.

567
00:26:50,638 --> 00:26:51,639

What?

568
00:26:51,722 --> 00:26:53,349

Well... then whoever this

569
00:26:53,432 --> 00:26:54,975
someone is, let's 
get them down here.

570
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:56,644
Maybe they can 
shed some light on...

571
00:26:56,727 --> 00:26:57,728



572
00:26:57,812 --> 00:26:59,397
Oh, no, no. I don't 
think I can do that.

573
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,481

Allison?

574
00:27:02,691 --> 00:27:04,026

I'll have to get back to you.

575
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:11,408

Gas 'N Go.

576
00:27:12,368 --> 00:27:13,619

Yeah? I'll accept.

577
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,120

It's your call.

578
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:21,293

Darrell?

579
00:27:21,293 --> 00:27:22,294

Hey.

580
00:27:23,045 --> 00:27:24,630

You didn't call last week.

581
00:27:24,922 --> 00:27:26,507

Lost my phone privileges.

582
00:27:27,132 --> 00:27:28,801

I waited two hours.

583
00:27:29,426 --> 00:27:31,470

I ate four Slim Jims,

584
00:27:32,596 --> 00:27:36,600
and I, uh, I won $5 
on the scratchers cards.

585
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:37,684

Henry.

586
00:27:38,727 --> 00:27:40,479

You remember the present I

587
00:27:40,562 --> 00:27:42,272

gave you, before I went away?

588
00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:45,442

Yeah, I love my present.

589
00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:48,320
Yeah, well, you 
got to get rid of it.

590
00:27:54,493 --> 00:27:57,579

Uh, Darrell, uh, no. I...

591
00:27:57,621 --> 00:27:59,206

What did I say when I gave it

592
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:00,749
to you? What 
did I say, Henry?!

593
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:02,417

I said you might have to

594
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:03,835
throw it away 
sometime, didn't I?

595
00:28:04,336 --> 00:28:06,380
You promised me 
you'd do what I said.

596
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,590
I thought you 
kept your promises.

597
00:28:09,174 --> 00:28:11,718

I do keep my promises, but...

598
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:14,388

Why?

599
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:17,057
People are asking 
questions about it.

600
00:28:17,432 --> 00:28:19,893
Bad people. And they're 
gonna come looking for it.

601
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:23,647
They can't come 
and take my present.

602
00:28:23,772 --> 00:28:24,815

Sure they can.

603
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:26,900

They'll take the present away,

604
00:28:26,942 --> 00:28:28,568
and then 
they'll take you away.

605
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,445

And we don't want that.

606
00:28:31,196 --> 00:28:32,530

So you got to get rid of it.

607
00:28:34,157 --> 00:28:35,158

Darrell...

608
00:28:37,494 --> 00:28:40,372
I'm gonna be 
all by myself again.

609
00:28:40,455 --> 00:28:41,706

I don't know what to tell you,

610
00:28:41,748 --> 00:28:42,957

Henry. You want to go to jail?

611
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:45,919
You'll have more 
company than you can stand.

612
00:28:52,717 --> 00:28:54,969

Does it have to be today?

613
00:28:55,095 --> 00:28:58,473
'Cause I promised 
her candy already.

614
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:01,434

Doesn't have to be today.

615
00:29:02,685 --> 00:29:03,937

You could do it tomorrow.

616
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:06,272

But you have to do it.

617
00:29:06,898 --> 00:29:09,067

Yeah, I'll do it tomorrow.

618
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:11,611

I'll keep my promise.

619
00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:28,878

So, it's the woods. So that

620
00:29:28,961 --> 00:29:30,588

must mean something rural.

621
00:29:32,131 --> 00:29:33,382

And there's a castle?

622
00:29:34,634 --> 00:29:37,720

It's... like a toy castle.

623
00:29:38,346 --> 00:29:40,389

It's a dream, so...

624
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:43,517
Well, I don't 
know that there are

625
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:45,228
many toy castles 
in rural Arizona.

626
00:29:45,686 --> 00:29:46,854

Maybe it's an amusement park

627
00:29:46,896 --> 00:29:47,980

or a miniature golf course.

628
00:29:48,731 --> 00:29:49,899

We'll check.

629
00:29:51,442 --> 00:29:52,902

We know who the ogre is.

630
00:29:53,611 --> 00:29:55,613
The blue and white 
house is where Sara lived.

631
00:29:57,823 --> 00:29:59,367

Is there anything else?

632
00:30:00,076 --> 00:30:02,203

No, I don't think so.

633
00:30:03,162 --> 00:30:04,955

You really think all this

634
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,707

stuff is going to save Sara?

635
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,334

We hope so.

636
00:30:08,751 --> 00:30:10,586

Well, I've got my homework.

637
00:30:12,463 --> 00:30:13,756
Very nice 
meeting you, Ariel. I

638
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,132
know it's way 
past your bedtime.

639
00:30:15,216 --> 00:30:16,675
I appreciate you 
staying up for me.

640
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:17,968

Uh, don't worry, I'll let

641
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:19,428
myself out. I'll 
see you tomorrow.

642
00:30:19,512 --> 00:30:20,512

Okay.

643
00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:26,101
- Night, Mommy. 
- Night, baby.

644
00:30:31,607 --> 00:30:33,233

Is Daddy okay?

645
00:30:34,652 --> 00:30:36,653
Why is he 
sitting outside alone?

646
00:30:38,238 --> 00:30:39,740

He's disappointed.

647
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,534
I made him a 
promise, and I couldn't

648
00:30:42,618 --> 00:30:44,787
keep it, and I feel 
very badly about it.

649
00:30:46,705 --> 00:30:50,042
But he'll forgive 
you eventually, won't he?

650
00:30:51,335 --> 00:30:52,753

He always does.

651
00:30:54,546 --> 00:30:56,173

This thing you did tonight?

652
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,383

I am very proud of you for

653
00:30:58,467 --> 00:30:59,927

trying to help this girl.

654
00:31:00,594 --> 00:31:02,638

But I also want you to know...

655
00:31:03,055 --> 00:31:05,098
having special 
dreams... knowing

656
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,100
things that 
people are thinking...

657
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,188
Sometimes when people 
grow up, that goes away,

658
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,191

and that's okay, too, okay?

659
00:31:14,816 --> 00:31:16,651
- Okay. 
- Love you.

660
00:31:16,902 --> 00:31:18,779
- Good night, Mom. 
- I love you.

661
00:31:28,914 --> 00:31:29,915

He just left.

662
00:31:35,378 --> 00:31:36,713

She was wonderful.

663
00:31:38,673 --> 00:31:41,259
I think it's going 
to be fine. I really do.

664
00:31:42,802 --> 00:31:45,138
And I believe it 
could still all go

665
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,390
away-- the 
dreams, the prescience.

666
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:51,144
I mean, what 
choice did we have?

667
00:31:51,227 --> 00:31:53,563
A little girl's 
life might be at stake.

668
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:54,773

I know you're right.

669
00:31:55,398 --> 00:31:56,733

I know we had no choice.

670
00:31:57,734 --> 00:31:59,360
It's just that 
two days ago, she

671
00:31:59,444 --> 00:32:01,070
didn't know there 
really were monsters...

672
00:32:02,614 --> 00:32:05,742
grown men who snatch 
little girls and keep 'em...

673
00:32:07,702 --> 00:32:08,745

or kill 'em.

674
00:32:10,413 --> 00:32:11,539

And now she does,

675
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,999

and I hate that.

676
00:32:18,212 --> 00:32:19,797

Go on; I'll be in in a minute.

677
00:32:32,268 --> 00:32:34,979
Every morning 
young Sara would awaken

678
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:36,814
and set about 
cooking and cleaning

679
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:38,566
and taking care 
of the whole castle.

680
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:41,569
And every night, she'd 
sit by the castle window

681
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:44,155

and secretly dream of someday

682
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:45,990

finding a gun

683
00:32:46,741 --> 00:32:49,243
and blowing her 
captor's brains out.

684
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:57,877

Springville? Why Springville?

685
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,712
Your daughter said 
woods. Woods means rural,

686
00:32:59,795 --> 00:33:01,380
so as a matter 
of course, I got the

687
00:33:01,464 --> 00:33:03,049
prison to check 
Darrell's phone records.

688
00:33:03,132 --> 00:33:05,009
Who's he calling? 
Where do they live?

689
00:33:05,676 --> 00:33:07,553
Pretty much every 
week, Darrell uses his phone

690
00:33:07,595 --> 00:33:09,388
privilege to call 
this number in Springville.

691
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,431

You're kidding.

692
00:33:10,514 --> 00:33:11,807

Wouldn't happen to be the home

693
00:33:11,891 --> 00:33:13,142
phone at some 
castle, would it?

694
00:33:14,894 --> 00:33:16,145

No such luck.

695
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:34,246

Good morning.

696
00:33:34,788 --> 00:33:36,165

I'm Detective Scanlon with

697
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:37,541

the Phoenix Police Department.

698
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:38,667

Okay.

699
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:39,752

I was wondering if we

700
00:33:39,835 --> 00:33:41,045

could ask you a few questions?

701
00:33:41,128 --> 00:33:42,129

Okay.

702
00:33:42,338 --> 00:33:43,672

You behind this counter most

703
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:45,090
Wednesdays 
between 3:00 and 4:00?

704
00:33:46,216 --> 00:33:47,718
We're 
investigating a series of

705
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:49,470
telephone calls that 
you've been receiving

706
00:33:49,553 --> 00:33:51,263

on a fairly regular basis from

707
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:52,973
Springville 
State Penitentiary.

708
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,892

Are the calls for you?

709
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,273

Sir?

710
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:04,443
The calls come here, 
but they aren't for me.

711
00:34:04,735 --> 00:34:06,695
This fellow 
Henry comes in every

712
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,655
Wednesday, waits 
for his brother to call.

713
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:10,073

I accept the charges.

714
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:11,450

Then he pays me cash for

715
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:12,743

the calls at the end of month.

716
00:34:12,826 --> 00:34:13,952

Henry Yellen.

717
00:34:14,745 --> 00:34:16,121

I don't know his last name.

718
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:17,789

He's got a...

719
00:34:18,415 --> 00:34:19,416

That's our guy.

720
00:34:22,002 --> 00:34:23,670
Has he ever come in 
here with anyone else?

721
00:34:24,337 --> 00:34:25,505

A little girl, maybe?

722
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,549
No, never seen a 
girl. Just Henry.

723
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:28,800

You wouldn't happen to know

724
00:34:28,884 --> 00:34:29,926

where he lives, would you?

725
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,012

No. I'm sorry.

726
00:34:32,095 --> 00:34:33,805
He doesn't have an 
account here? You never

727
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:35,682
delivered groceries 
to his place or anything?

728
00:34:35,765 --> 00:34:36,766

No.

729
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,310
What if I get a 
warrant, search your

730
00:34:38,393 --> 00:34:39,853
records? Would 
that change anything?

731
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,986
Incredible what a memory 
jogger a warrant is, huh?

732
00:34:53,908 --> 00:34:54,909

What?

733
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,161

Castle Road.

734
00:35:15,305 --> 00:35:16,389

Someone's coming.

735
00:35:16,806 --> 00:35:18,766

Oh, my gosh, someone's coming!

736
00:35:19,893 --> 00:35:20,935

It's not a castle.

737
00:35:22,103 --> 00:35:23,980
Well, it's the 
only house on the road.

738
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:29,777
Don't let 'em 
see you! Get away!

739
00:35:33,823 --> 00:35:35,742

Coming to take my present.

740
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:40,204

Get in the closet.

741
00:35:40,288 --> 00:35:41,372

No...

742
00:35:42,665 --> 00:35:44,250

I don't want to lose my

743
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:45,751
present. Now 
get in the closet.

744
00:35:45,835 --> 00:35:47,503

Please don't make me.

745
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,799
Mr. Yellen, I'm 
with the Phoenix Police.

746
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,093
If you're in there, you 
want to open up, please?

747
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:05,479
Good morning, 
Officer. I'll be right down.

748
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,781
Come on, hurry up 
and get in the closet.

749
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,172
Mr. Yellen, we 
haven't got all day!

750
00:36:32,631 --> 00:36:34,925

Sara! Shh!

751
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,219

They're going to hear you.

752
00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:39,638

Then let me out!

753
00:36:40,222 --> 00:36:43,434
I'll be quiet! 
Just let me out!

754
00:36:43,726 --> 00:36:44,727

Mr. Yellen?

755
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:53,277

Mr. Yellen?

756
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,279
You promise not 
to make a sound?

757
00:36:57,156 --> 00:36:58,198

I promise.

758
00:37:03,078 --> 00:37:04,705

I love my present.

759
00:37:06,206 --> 00:37:08,083
I don't want to 
hurt my present.

760
00:37:11,336 --> 00:37:12,337

No sound.

761
00:37:13,755 --> 00:37:14,756

No sound!

762
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:17,009

No noise.

763
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:19,553

Mr. Yellen?

764
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:23,223

I'm coming!

765
00:37:24,224 --> 00:37:26,351

Here I... here I come!

766
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:34,651
- Hello? 
- Hi, Mom.

767
00:37:34,776 --> 00:37:35,777

Ariel?

768
00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:38,196
I woke up this morning, 
and you had already left.

769
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:39,823
I had to come out 
to the country with

770
00:37:39,906 --> 00:37:41,366
Detective 
Scanlon. What is it, baby?

771
00:37:41,449 --> 00:37:42,993

I just... I had another dream.

772
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:44,911

Hello, Officer.

773
00:37:45,954 --> 00:37:49,791
Took me a minute 
to, uh, tie my shoes.

774
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:51,835
- You Henry Yellen? 
- Yeah, that's right.

775
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:54,504

Honey, I didn't get that.

776
00:37:54,963 --> 00:37:56,881
What-what did you 
say about your dream?

777
00:37:57,007 --> 00:37:59,009

I said, "I had another dream".

778
00:38:03,763 --> 00:38:04,764

We're investigating

779
00:38:04,848 --> 00:38:05,849

the disappearance

780
00:38:05,932 --> 00:38:07,392
of a little girl 
named Sara Crewson.

781
00:38:07,475 --> 00:38:09,978
It was another 
dream where I was Sara.

782
00:38:10,061 --> 00:38:11,062

Do you have a problem if

783
00:38:11,146 --> 00:38:12,188

we look around your house?

784
00:38:14,357 --> 00:38:15,942

Ariel, this is important.

785
00:38:16,151 --> 00:38:17,527
- Tell me, what happened? 
- I

786
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,070
don't see how I 
could do that, be...

787
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,739
Uh, I mean, this is 
my house, and, uh, I

788
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:24,450
don't think I have 
to let you in my house.

789
00:38:24,492 --> 00:38:26,619
Well, I was 
sitting in the Castle

790
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:28,705
again, and you were 
telling the story...

791
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:33,584

I can go to my car, call

792
00:38:33,668 --> 00:38:34,836

the local courthouse and get

793
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:35,920

a piece of paper that'll

794
00:38:36,004 --> 00:38:37,213

make you let me in your house.

795
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,715
- Only this time... 
- Going

796
00:38:38,798 --> 00:38:40,008

to make me do that, Henry?

797
00:38:41,008 --> 00:38:43,886
That's not true. 
Uh, this is my house,

798
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,179

- And you can't just come in

799
00:38:45,263 --> 00:38:46,597
here. 
- What? Damn! I can't hear!

800
00:38:46,681 --> 00:38:48,683
You can't just come 
and take my present.

801
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:50,768
Mr. Yellen, I don't 
think you're understanding me.

802
00:38:50,852 --> 00:38:52,812
I'm going in there-- 
it's a matter of whether

803
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:54,856
you're going to be 
smiling or frowning when I do.

804
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,278
Okay, Henry, 
I'm going back to my

805
00:39:00,361 --> 00:39:01,737
car. I'm going 
to call the judge.

806
00:39:06,993 --> 00:39:10,246

I had a gun, and I shot him.

807
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:11,330

A gun?!

808
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,084

Mom?!

809
00:39:16,752 --> 00:39:17,753

Mom?

810
00:39:18,754 --> 00:39:19,755

Sara!

811
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,174

Put that gun down!

812
00:39:22,258 --> 00:39:23,259

Mom?

813
00:39:23,342 --> 00:39:25,761
Can you come down here?! 
Are you locked up there?!

814
00:39:25,845 --> 00:39:26,887

I'm coming to get you!

815
00:39:27,346 --> 00:39:29,014
- Ariel, I'm okay, I'm okay. 
- We need an

816
00:39:29,098 --> 00:39:30,683
ambulance at Castle 
Road in Springville.

817
00:39:30,766 --> 00:39:33,894
You did it! We 
got her! She's okay!

818
00:39:36,897 --> 00:39:37,898

Mom?

819
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,024

My present.

820
00:39:39,817 --> 00:39:42,152

You'll take away my present.

821
00:39:42,361 --> 00:39:43,946

She's not a present.

822
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:49,159

I'm okay, I'm okay.

823
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:52,246
- Okay. Bye. 
- Bye, baby, bye.

824
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:58,252

Here, sweetie. It's okay,

825
00:39:58,335 --> 00:40:00,129
it's okay. It's 
going to be okay.

826
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:03,841
It's okay. It's okay. 
It's going to be okay.

827
00:40:10,055 --> 00:40:11,181

Mom?

828
00:40:12,683 --> 00:40:13,684

Mom?

829
00:40:15,852 --> 00:40:18,230
Slept through the 
night in my own room.

830
00:40:18,647 --> 00:40:19,731

No dreams?

831
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:22,150

Just one.

832
00:40:24,027 --> 00:40:26,113
Nothing much 
happened in it, though.

833
00:40:26,446 --> 00:40:28,573

It was just about how I

834
00:40:28,657 --> 00:40:30,659

lived here with you and Daddy

835
00:40:30,784 --> 00:40:32,619

and Bridgette and Marie and we

836
00:40:32,661 --> 00:40:34,413

all lived happily ever after.

837
00:40:34,454 --> 00:40:37,165
Wow, that sounds 
like a fairy tale.

838
00:40:37,874 --> 00:40:39,793
You still 
believe in fairy tales?

839
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:45,590
Good. I'll tell Daddy. 
It'll make him very happy.

840
00:40:46,174 --> 00:40:50,053

Fee, fi, fo, fum...

841
00:40:50,512 --> 00:40:54,182
I smell the blood 
of a Dubois young'un.

842
00:40:54,266 --> 00:40:55,642

What's going on here?!
