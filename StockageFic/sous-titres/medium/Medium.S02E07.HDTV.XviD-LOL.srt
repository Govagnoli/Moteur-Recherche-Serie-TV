1
00:00:00,998 --> 00:00:02,025
Thank you.

2
00:00:03,827 --> 00:00:04,669
Good afternoon.

3
00:00:04,935 --> 00:00:06,951
You know, I've got some important news for you.

4
00:00:07,054 --> 00:00:08,926
No one is born rich.

5
00:00:08,977 --> 00:00:09,625
No one.

6
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,668
Everyone is born naked and penniless.

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:13,778
So how do you get rich?

8
00:00:13,829 --> 00:00:14,916
How do you stay rich?

9
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:16,449
How do you get even richer?

10
00:00:17,488 --> 00:00:18,379
That's why we're here.

11
00:00:19,276 --> 00:00:20,242
That's what we want to know, right?

12
00:00:20,293 --> 00:00:21,527
Me? My theory?

13
00:00:21,578 --> 00:00:23,919
It all boils down to six words:

14
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:26,504
What are you willing to do?

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,060
Can you stand up for me, please?

16
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:33,022
How much do you make a year, ma'am?

17
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:35,719
I'd rather not say.

18
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,455
I'll give you $100 to say.

19
00:00:38,597 --> 00:00:39,277
Two hundred.

20
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,273
Uh, I make about $37,500 a year.

21
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:47,027
$37,700 now.

22
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,410
Liking this, right?

23
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:50,508
Money's good.

24
00:00:50,588 --> 00:00:51,911
Money is good.

25
00:00:53,114 --> 00:00:54,880
Are you wearing clean underwear?

26
00:00:56,584 --> 00:00:57,705
Pardon me?

27
00:00:57,756 --> 00:00:58,715
Are you wearing clean underwear?

28
00:00:59,347 --> 00:01:00,127
It's just a question.

29
00:01:00,178 --> 00:01:02,039
And I will give you $100 to tell me.

30
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:04,171
Sure.

31
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:06,321
I'm wearing clean underwear.

32
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,802
Take off all of your clothes,

33
00:01:08,853 --> 00:01:09,974
right here, right now,

34
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:10,625
in front of everybody,

35
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:12,824
and I will double your annual income.

36
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,602
Bring you up to a cool $75,000.

37
00:01:14,653 --> 00:01:15,436
What do you say?

38
00:01:16,124 --> 00:01:17,187
No, no,

39
00:01:17,238 --> 00:01:18,626
I can't do that.

40
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:19,639
No, no, no, no.

41
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,502
Is that your husband?

42
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,680
Yes.

43
00:01:21,788 --> 00:01:22,835
Couldn't he use the money, too?

44
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:25,045
It doesn't matter, I...

45
00:01:26,117 --> 00:01:27,672
I'm not gonna do it.

46
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:31,364
Besides, he doesn't want me to do it, either.

47
00:01:31,415 --> 00:01:32,015
Me! I'll do it!

48
00:01:31,822 --> 00:01:32,422
Pick me!

49
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:33,253
I didn't ask you!

50
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:35,066
It's easy for you.

51
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:36,548
I'm asking her.

52
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:39,659
You know, it's 3:15 in the afternoon.

53
00:01:39,746 --> 00:01:42,577
By 3:16, you could have doubled your annual income.

54
00:01:42,628 --> 00:01:44,671
You could have twice as much money as you have right now.

55
00:01:44,722 --> 00:01:45,937
You could pay off your bills.

56
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:47,700
You could buy yourself something nice.

57
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:48,916
All you have to do is...

58
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,816
But I can't. Um...

59
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,099
Thank you, anyway.

60
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:57,614
Okay, I will triple your annual salary.

61
00:01:57,665 --> 00:02:00,640
Bring you up to $112,500.

62
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:01,836
That's six figures.

63
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:03,036
That's really nice.

64
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,700
Just take off your clothes.

65
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:06,363
But I can't.

66
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,454
Why don't you ask one of them?

67
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:10,395
'Cause I'm asking you.

68
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:14,193
Okay, I'll triple your annual salary,

69
00:02:14,244 --> 00:02:14,986
not just this year,

70
00:02:15,037 --> 00:02:16,291
but for the rest of your life.

71
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:19,795
Let's say you live over 30 years.

72
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:21,890
That's over two million dollars.

73
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:22,541
You'd be rich.

74
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,594
You'd be a millionaire.

75
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:25,078
What do you say?

76
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:27,235
I can't.

77
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:28,880
You can't or you won't?

78
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:31,367
I won't do it.

79
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,593
Is that your final answer?

80
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:36,669
Yes, yes,

81
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,238
that's my final answer.

82
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,971
Remember these six words, folks:

83
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:42,872
What are you willing to do?

84
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:45,799
What about you, sir?

85
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,205
Excuse me?

86
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:52,455
Well, sure, I'd take off my clothes for a couple million.

87
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:53,429
No, the question is:

88
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,997
Will you take hers off?

89
00:02:56,735 --> 00:02:58,130
If she lives 30 years,

90
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,430
that's over $2,250,000.

91
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:01,210
You'd be a millionaire.

92
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:02,133
You'd be rich.

93
00:03:03,527 --> 00:03:04,730
What are you willing to do?

94
00:03:05,502 --> 00:03:06,312
What are you willing to do?

95
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:09,574
I want to go.

96
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:11,000
I want to leave!

97
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:11,801
Shut up!

98
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:12,997
What are you willing to do?

99
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:16,931
Get off of me!

100
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:19,194
A hundred dollars for anybody to help me!

101
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:20,685
Get off of me!

102
00:03:34,368 --> 00:03:35,246
What do you think about this?

103
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:38,646
Nice.

104
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,470
I don't want nice.

105
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:40,432
It's jury duty.

106
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,479
I want something that says "You can't trust this man."

107
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:44,300
What do you think?

108
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:46,225
Bowling or pineapples?

109
00:03:46,872 --> 00:03:48,171
I have no idea.

110
00:03:48,222 --> 00:03:48,822
Come on!

111
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:49,375
This is your area.

112
00:03:49,426 --> 00:03:50,026
Help me out here,

113
00:03:50,026 --> 00:03:51,417
give me a little guidance-- pick one.

114
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:52,732
I'll give you a hundred bucks.

115
00:03:53,573 --> 00:03:54,357
Go naked.

116
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:43,534
The kids are up.

117
00:04:43,585 --> 00:04:44,613
I heard noises.

118
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:47,577
Decided to go with clothes after all, huh?

119
00:04:48,347 --> 00:04:49,633
Don't say I didn't warn you.

120
00:04:49,965 --> 00:04:51,323
Help me!

121
00:04:51,814 --> 00:04:53,030
What is going on?

122
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,766
She's gonna murder me!

123
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:57,156
There you are!

124
00:04:57,386 --> 00:04:59,097
No screaming.

125
00:04:59,148 --> 00:05:00,357
It's 6:30 in the morning.

126
00:05:00,408 --> 00:05:01,382
You're gonna wake the baby.

127
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:02,360
That's my shirt,

128
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:03,278
that's my sweater,

129
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:04,256
that's my hair band.

130
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:07,687
I put them out last night and she woke up first and she took them.

131
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,501
Tell her she has to take them off!

132
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:11,394
Bridgette...

133
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,237
Take... them... off!

134
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:18,949
But she took out 15 different things!

135
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,989
Three. I was choosing.

136
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,358
And I choose that!

137
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:23,319
Okay, no snatching.

138
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,800
Hey, hey, hey.

139
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:26,047
Hold on a second.

140
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,655
Everybody back up.

141
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:31,035
Bridgette, you're wearing your sister's clothes.

142
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:32,633
Did you ask before you put them on?

143
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:33,779
Huh?

144
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:34,856
No, she didn't.

145
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:35,985
Why are you smiling?

146
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:36,678
Did you ask?

147
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:39,894
Okay, Ariel-- do you think,

148
00:05:39,945 --> 00:05:40,937
if she asks nicely,

149
00:05:41,196 --> 00:05:43,136
could you possibly wear one of the other two outfits

150
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:44,308
that were contenders for today?

151
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:45,237
I don't know.

152
00:05:46,193 --> 00:05:47,124
Why should I?

153
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:49,133
Please?

154
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:50,778
I guess.

155
00:05:50,922 --> 00:05:51,522
Okay.

156
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,126
Thank you, Ariel.

157
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:53,362
Whatever.

158
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:54,745
It doesn't look good on you, anyway.

159
00:05:55,286 --> 00:05:55,886
See?

160
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,394
Another crisis averted.

161
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,279
Joe Dubois--

162
00:06:00,512 --> 00:06:03,305
our juries need citizens like you.

163
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:04,631
Don't even say that.

164
00:06:04,682 --> 00:06:05,773
Someone might hear.

165
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:06,424
Take that back.

166
00:06:06,404 --> 00:06:07,270
I will not.

167
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:09,325
I am proud that you're summoned for jury duty.

168
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:11,082
What's jury duty?

169
00:06:11,353 --> 00:06:14,653
It's a gigantic waste of Daddy's time, that's what it is.

170
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:17,451
It's one of the things that makes our justice system great.

171
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:18,875
When people get in trouble,

172
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:21,040
they get to be judged by people just like them.

173
00:06:21,217 --> 00:06:22,212
It's called a jury.

174
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:25,711
And it's every citizen's obligation to be on one.

175
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:27,332
And it's an honor to be asked.

176
00:06:27,813 --> 00:06:28,479
Mommy's right.

177
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,161
It is an honor.

178
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:32,675
It's just a really inconvenient honor because Daddy has, like,

179
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,800
three million things that he has to do at work,

180
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:39,003
and I really can't afford the day.

181
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:41,199
You'll be lucky if it's a day.

182
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:42,146
It'll be a lot longer,

183
00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:43,268
if you get picked.

184
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,871
Don't worry, I'm not going to get picked.

185
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:47,713
You got a lot of faith in that shirt.

186
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:50,889
It's not the shirt I'm counting on, darling; it's you.

187
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:52,461
Me? What about me?

188
00:06:53,306 --> 00:06:56,248
You. You work for the DA.

189
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:57,860
Think about it.

190
00:06:58,906 --> 00:07:02,414
What defense attorney is going to want the spouse of somebody who works for

191
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:05,516
the DA sitting up there judging his or her client?

192
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:07,254
You, darling,

193
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,464
are my "Get Out of Jail Free" card.

194
00:07:12,338 --> 00:07:13,555
Mr. District Attorney...

195
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:16,057
do you have a moment?

196
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:17,173
Take your time,
counselor.

197
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:18,387
We're both going to the same place.

198
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,462
They can't start without us.

199
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:21,056
Well, how about we don't start at all.

200
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:23,206
I've made six plea offers.

201
00:07:23,257 --> 00:07:24,561
You haven't even responded.

202
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,722
Make me a serious proposal,
I'll be happy to respond.

203
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:30,652
Okay. Class-B Criminal Negligence with a fine and community service.

204
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,557
A fine and community service?

205
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,963
Your client killed his wife.

206
00:07:35,014 --> 00:07:36,255
No, he did not.

207
00:07:36,618 --> 00:07:38,354
Come on, the facts are not in dispute here.

208
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:40,161
They were on the boat,
they were both drinking,

209
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:42,896
he went to sleep and she fell overboard in the middle of the night.

210
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:43,572
It's a horrible,

211
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:45,956
terrible accident but it is not a violation of the law.

212
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:46,940
Well actually, counselor,

213
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:48,257
the facts are in dispute here.

214
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:49,833
I'm not sure I believe your client's story.

215
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:50,684
Excuse me?!

216
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:52,096
But let's put that aside for the time being.

217
00:07:52,147 --> 00:07:53,922
Let's say we accept his version of things.

218
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,447
He still committed a crime.

219
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,407
It's called criminally negligent homicide.

220
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:01,152
He left his severely intoxicated wife on the deck of a boat at sea.

221
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:03,557
There was substantial and reasonable risk she would die.

222
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:04,921
Yeah, I know the statute.

223
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:05,948
Oh, I'm sure you do.

224
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:09,517
And I know that you know that any kind of homicide requires proof that the

225
00:08:09,568 --> 00:08:10,981
victim be actually dead.

226
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:12,053
Like a body.

227
00:08:12,104 --> 00:08:13,276
Which you do not have.

228
00:08:13,432 --> 00:08:15,749
You've had divers at the bottom of that lake for nine weeks.

229
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,133
You have come up with nothing.

230
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:19,073
So let's talk plea.

231
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,981
Let's not.

232
00:08:22,196 --> 00:08:23,843
Moving along to number 19,

233
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:25,429
Mr. Joseph Dubois.

234
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:29,309
Joseph Dubois?

235
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:31,585
Yes... Sorry.

236
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,466
Yes. Present.

237
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:33,971
Now, before the attorneys begin,

238
00:08:34,022 --> 00:08:36,006
I'd like to ask you about one thing.

239
00:08:36,372 --> 00:08:37,949
I noticed on your jury questionnaire,

240
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,770
you noted that your wife works for the district attorney.

241
00:08:41,114 --> 00:08:41,775
Is that correct?

242
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:44,147
Yes, that is correct.

243
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:45,645
Mr. Dubois, as a juror,

244
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:49,074
you have an obligation not to discuss this case or your opinions with anyone,

245
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,399
including your wife.

246
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:51,749
Will that be a problem?

247
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:53,293
I don't think so, no.

248
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:54,402
All right.

249
00:08:54,756 --> 00:08:55,646
Mr. Devalos?

250
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:59,874
Has Mrs. Dubois done any work on this case at all?

251
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:03,611
Has she met with Stephen Garner or any of the other witnesses?

252
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,465
No, Your Honor, she has not.

253
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:06,609
All right.

254
00:09:07,124 --> 00:09:07,815
Mr. Devalos,

255
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:08,847
you may begin.

256
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:12,179
We have no questions for Mr. Dubois.

257
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,842
Thank you.

258
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:14,153
Ms. Romney,

259
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:17,285
I'm certain you do have some questions for Mr. Dubois.

260
00:09:17,705 --> 00:09:18,676
Thank you, Your Honor.

261
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:20,019
Just a few.

262
00:09:21,903 --> 00:09:23,132
Mr. Dubois...

263
00:09:24,348 --> 00:09:28,262
you say in your questionnaire that you work in the aerospace industry.

264
00:09:28,313 --> 00:09:29,478
What do you do exactly?

265
00:09:30,144 --> 00:09:32,023
I'm a systems design mathematician.

266
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:34,129
And do you make a good living doing that?

267
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:35,674
I do all right.

268
00:09:36,115 --> 00:09:38,804
Do you work with people who do much better than you do?

269
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,055
Sure.

270
00:09:40,265 --> 00:09:42,546
A lot of our suppliers are start-ups, so...

271
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:45,167
if you patent the right concept,

272
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,050
you can start your own company.

273
00:09:47,425 --> 00:09:48,781
There's a lot of money in aerospace.

274
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:49,758
Interesting.

275
00:09:49,813 --> 00:09:51,239
And how do you feel about those people,

276
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,195
the ones who managed to strike it rich in your field?

277
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:57,755
I guess I hope to be one... someday.

278
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,363
Here's hoping.

279
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:02,937
Do you drink, Mr. Dubois?

280
00:10:03,284 --> 00:10:04,234
Mm, sometimes.

281
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:05,261
In moderation.

282
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:08,398
Did you ever drink a little too much?

283
00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:10,539
Sure...
well, not for awhile.

284
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,084
When I was younger.
In college.

285
00:10:12,406 --> 00:10:14,268
And, during one of those times,

286
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:15,928
when you were under the influence of alcohol,

287
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:19,194
did you ever make a decision you regretted?

288
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,700
Or do something or say something that was...

289
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,686
I don't know... ill-advised?

290
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:26,039
Sure. Absolutely.

291
00:10:26,137 --> 00:10:27,391
I mean,
isn't that what college is for?

292
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:29,830
Thank you, Mr. Dubois.

293
00:10:30,026 --> 00:10:31,480
- Okay. You're welcome.
- No more questions.

294
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:32,912
All right, approach.

295
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:39,090
Mr. Dubois is certainly an acceptable juror to the prosecution.

296
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:40,668
What a surprise.

297
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:41,649
Ms. Romney?

298
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:44,119
Mr. Dubois is equally acceptable to the defense.

299
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:45,843
Terrific.

300
00:10:46,305 --> 00:10:47,048
Your Honor,

301
00:10:47,177 --> 00:10:50,825
I'm concerned that either defense is setting up grounds for an appeal based

302
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:53,578
on incompetent counsel or she needs another cup of espresso.

303
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,642
No, Your Honor.

304
00:10:54,693 --> 00:10:57,673
Actually, Mr. Dubois is just what I'm looking for.

305
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,387
He seems like an intelligent man, a logical man,

306
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:04,218
with no apparent prejudices or predispositions against people who have more

307
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:05,069
money than he does.

308
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,304
He claims to have and understanding of how alcohol can impair your judgment,

309
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:09,537
and, most of all,

310
00:11:09,588 --> 00:11:10,825
he seems like a fair man.

311
00:11:11,062 --> 00:11:11,935
And at the end of the day,

312
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:13,358
what more can I ask for?

313
00:11:14,155 --> 00:11:14,784
Thank you.

314
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,072
Mr. Dubois...

315
00:11:17,118 --> 00:11:17,718
Yes.

316
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:18,813
Uh, sorry, your Honor,

317
00:11:18,864 --> 00:11:20,071
I was just hoping that I could get my, um,

318
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:22,016
my slip from the clerk.

319
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,480
Well, no, Mr. Dubois,

320
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:24,380
you're not dismissed.

321
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,019
You're serving on this jury.

322
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:27,278
Congratulations.

323
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:33,729
They finally asleep?

324
00:11:33,997 --> 00:11:34,644
That took awhile.

325
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,875
I'm going to do lunches in the morning.

326
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:38,762
I'm too tired.

327
00:11:39,055 --> 00:11:39,660
Okay.

328
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:41,528
You almost ready for bed?

329
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:42,416
Yeah.

330
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:43,992
I just got to finish this.

331
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,413
Until this trial's over,

332
00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:47,617
it's like I got two jobs.

333
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:49,117
Hey, who's that?

334
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,694
...in the death of his wife,
Jessica Garner.

335
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:54,639
Hey, that's the guy who was in my dream last night.

336
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,230
...of criminally negligenthomicide in a trial that begins today...

337
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:01,147
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

338
00:12:01,672 --> 00:12:02,580
Where are you going?

339
00:12:02,814 --> 00:12:04,228
I can't watch that news report.

340
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:05,899
That's my case.
I can't watch that.

341
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,596
That's the case I was picked to be a juror on.

342
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:10,350
Turning to weather....

343
00:12:10,622 --> 00:12:12,606
The forecast,
mostly sunny skies today,

344
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:13,723
with brisky, chilly winds...

345
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,642
Is it over?

346
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:17,136
The scary part's over.

347
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:20,701
So that's your case, huh?

348
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,329
I don't even think I'm allowed to answer that.

349
00:12:23,748 --> 00:12:26,160
Oh, come on. I don't know anything about it, honest.

350
00:12:26,691 --> 00:12:28,487
Ally, you just told me you had a dream about the guy.

351
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,046
Yeah, it wasn't that kind of dream.

352
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:32,755
It was a crazy dream.
A nonsense dream.

353
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:34,223
Al, I don't want to talk about it, okay?

354
00:12:34,731 --> 00:12:36,512
Wow. Look who got religion.

355
00:12:36,938 --> 00:12:39,916
This morning you would have done anything to get out of jury duty.

356
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,117
Now suddenly, you're the jury duty poster boy.

357
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:42,944
Cute.

358
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:45,083
You're not too bad yourself.

359
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,346
Okay, guys,

360
00:13:46,397 --> 00:13:47,727
jackets and backpacks.

361
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,829
Have a great day, guys.

362
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:49,762
Bye, Mom.

363
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:50,348
Bye, Dad.

364
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:51,521
Bye, baby.

365
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,990
Can we drive all together everyday?

366
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:57,659
If gas doesn't get any cheaper, we might have to.

367
00:13:58,099 --> 00:13:59,929
It's kind of special today,
sweetie.

368
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,963
Mommy and Daddy are working at the same place.

369
00:14:02,504 --> 00:14:03,584
Bridgette, come on.

370
00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:05,190
Bye, pumpkin.

371
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:05,985
Bye, darlin'.

372
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:06,803
Bye.

373
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,127
I'm coming.

374
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:19,386
Allison...

375
00:14:20,265 --> 00:14:21,056
What are you doing?

376
00:14:21,349 --> 00:14:23,641
Oh, just catching up on the Stephen Garner case.

377
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:27,911
Okay... I just need you to stop reading what you're reading,

378
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:29,533
get up and walk out of this room.

379
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:31,481
Excuse me?

380
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,464
Your husband is on the jury,
Allison.

381
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,585
No, I know, I wasn't going to discuss any of this.

382
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:38,198
It's just...

383
00:14:39,742 --> 00:14:41,294
I've been having dreams.

384
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:44,031
You've had dreams about this case?

385
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:48,831
Anything definite?
Anything that we should be investigating?

386
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:50,051
Well, maybe.
I don't...

387
00:14:50,404 --> 00:14:52,478
I don't know how the pieces fit together.

388
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:53,623
Okay, forget it.

389
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:58,610
Allison, I just need you to please get up and walk out of this room.

390
00:14:58,751 --> 00:14:59,643
But why?

391
00:14:59,985 --> 00:15:00,585
Why?

392
00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:04,629
Because if a judge finds out that you are working on this case in any capacity--

393
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,696
if he walked in right now and saw you with these files,

394
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:08,327
we'd be looking at a mistrial.

395
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,508
And Stephen Garner would walk.

396
00:15:11,062 --> 00:15:13,661
He would have murdered his wife and walked away.

397
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,244
I don't understand.
He's not on trial for murder.

398
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:19,136
It was an accident,
it was negligence, wasn't it?

399
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:20,251
You know,

400
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:23,773
it's funny, most of the time I'm staring at a crime and I'm looking for motive,

401
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:25,405
means and opportunity.

402
00:15:25,573 --> 00:15:29,305
Here, I've got all three and yet I'm forced to behave as if there's no crime.

403
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,893
I'm sorry,
I'm not following you.

404
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,422
In my opinion,

405
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:37,713
Stephen Garner took his rich wife out on that boat and killed her.

406
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:39,890
Maybe he got her drunk and pushed her.

407
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:42,738
Maybe he just smashed in her skull and threw her overboard.

408
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:44,732
I don't have a body so I don't know.

409
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:49,953
But whatever happened, the final result is she's dead and he did it on purpose.

410
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:51,752
- But why?
- Money.

411
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:52,618
Hers...

412
00:15:53,196 --> 00:15:54,879
a $40 million trust fund.

413
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:57,314
But I can't prove that.

414
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,914
So I'm hoping to get a conviction on criminally negligent homicide,

415
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:03,773
and then, maybe, I can put him away for four years.

416
00:16:04,123 --> 00:16:06,297
Four years on a garbage charge.

417
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:09,352
And that's all the justice I can offer this poor woman.

418
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:13,369
So, please, don't make an impossible task harder.

419
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:19,005
Just get up, walk out, and I'll give the files back to Sondra.

420
00:16:23,814 --> 00:16:25,589
We didn't even get on the water till after 10:00.

421
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,905
Dropped anchor in Jefferson Cove.

422
00:16:28,532 --> 00:16:31,050
I started to cook dinner while she got out the wine.

423
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,248
How much wine did your wife drink?

424
00:16:35,382 --> 00:16:36,380
I'm not sure.

425
00:16:37,004 --> 00:16:38,916
We finished, maybe,
three bottles.

426
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:40,851
Three bottles of wine for two people.

427
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,967
Would you say she was intoxicated?

428
00:16:44,428 --> 00:16:46,130
Yes. Uh, we both were.

429
00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:47,972
But, uh...

430
00:16:48,112 --> 00:16:49,564
it's not like we had to drive anywhere.

431
00:16:49,615 --> 00:16:52,916
I mean, we were in the middle of a lake on a boat.

432
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:54,489
I really didn't think anything could happen.

433
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,300
Mr. Garner,

434
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:59,406
you testified that at midnight you went below and left your wife alone on deck.

435
00:16:59,823 --> 00:17:01,678
Yes, sir, that's correct.

436
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,807
That... I was tired.

437
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:04,572
Tired...

438
00:17:04,836 --> 00:17:06,974
from all the alcohol you consumed?

439
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:08,607
Well, certainly that was part of it.

440
00:17:11,528 --> 00:17:12,558
And what was the rest of it?

441
00:17:21,345 --> 00:17:22,933
I'm sorry, you said that was part of it.

442
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:28,080
We had an argument.

443
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,352
I'm sorry, could you speak a little louder?

444
00:17:29,594 --> 00:17:30,194
Did you say,

445
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,842
you and your wife had a fight?

446
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:34,324
No. It was an argument.

447
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,932
It was like a disagreement.

448
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:38,065
An argument.

449
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:40,631
You never mentioned an argument in your pre-trial deposition.

450
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:44,192
Your Honor, I need a moment to confer with my client.

451
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,575
Well, your client chose to testify in his own defense, Miss Romney.

452
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:49,352
He can confer after court.

453
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:50,351
So, you had an argument.

454
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,272
Was it heated?

455
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:52,999
Was it violent?

456
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:54,016
No, of course not.

457
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:56,166
It was just... it was an argument.

458
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:59,993
Jess was very insecure about the way she looked.

459
00:18:00,328 --> 00:18:04,032
And sometimes when she drank she'd accuse me of marrying her for her money.

460
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:06,190
Really?

461
00:18:08,271 --> 00:18:09,405
Any truth to that, Mr. Garner?

462
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,496
Did you marry her for money?

463
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,231
Objection. Irrelevant.

464
00:18:11,282 --> 00:18:14,141
I married her because I had no choice.

465
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:19,566
I married her because the moment I met her I could think of nothing else.

466
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:25,355
I married her because the thought of spending a single day without her by my side...

467
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:31,817
And I'll bet the money didn't hurt.

468
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:32,996
Objection, Your Honor.

469
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,484
Sustained.

470
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:40,733
Yeah, "but I bet the money didn't hurt." I don't like that guy.

471
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:42,317
Who, the D.A.?

472
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,899
- Yeah.
- Well, he's got to try and make a case.

473
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:46,609
What are you talking about?
There is no case.

474
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:49,471
A guy goes to sleep, wakes up and his wife's gone.

475
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:51,814
That's a crime?
Hell, half the world is guilty,

476
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:52,872
then, including my ex.

477
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:54,683
This is a tragedy,

478
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:56,840
maybe a mystery,
but it isn't any crime.

479
00:18:57,854 --> 00:18:58,729
Daddy!

480
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:00,498
Hi.

481
00:19:00,903 --> 00:19:02,936
Hi. Whoa.

482
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,123
Daddy!

483
00:19:04,671 --> 00:19:05,599
I'll see you tomorrow, Joe.

484
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,580
I got to go buy a seat cushion.

485
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:07,547
Okay.

486
00:19:07,588 --> 00:19:09,050
Mommy said that if we all came,

487
00:19:09,101 --> 00:19:10,958
then we could all go out to dinner and I could choose where.

488
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:13,675
Yeah? Well, if that's what Mommy said, that's what Mommy said.

489
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:14,581
Really?

490
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,091
Oh, God I love this.

491
00:19:16,498 --> 00:19:20,172
We drive in together,
I'm done by 5:00, we eat together.

492
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:21,484
Forget everything I said this morning.

493
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,272
I may apply to become a career juror.

494
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,654
Well, don't fill out that application just yet.

495
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:28,249
You might want to give it a week or two.

496
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:31,079
I don't know.
If today's any indication,

497
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:32,911
I don't know if this thing's going to go a week or two.

498
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:35,534
Frankly, I don't think your boss has very much to work with.

499
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:37,693
Okay, what's it going to be,
sweetie?

500
00:19:38,008 --> 00:19:39,137
I want chicken fingers.

501
00:19:39,188 --> 00:19:40,168
Pick a chicken place!

502
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:56,540
My turn to choose and I choose Italian.

503
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,100
Italian? Okay. Where's Mom?

504
00:19:59,756 --> 00:20:00,513
Where's Mommy going?

505
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:05,147
Hi.

506
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:41,583
They hate your boss.

507
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:43,946
They think he has no case.

508
00:20:44,616 --> 00:20:45,707
Who, the jury?

509
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:47,385
I thought we weren't supposed to discuss...

510
00:20:47,474 --> 00:20:49,278
No, I'm not talking about the facts of the case.

511
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:50,601
I'm just talking about your boss.

512
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:52,027
Tell him to lighten up.

513
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,007
Or don't. I...

514
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,489
It's just so weird not being able to talk to you about something that

515
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,152
consumes so much of my day.

516
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:01,919
Well, yeah, likewise.

517
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:06,205
Remember, if we see her,

518
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:07,992
you're on your own--
I can't be a part of this.

519
00:21:08,415 --> 00:21:09,135
Understood.

520
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:14,030
Tell me again,
what'd you see exactly?

521
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,571
They were in bed,
they were making love.

522
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:16,862
What do you want, details?

523
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:17,853
Sure, if you're offering.

524
00:21:21,938 --> 00:21:22,840
His wife's been gone seven months.

525
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:24,635
I wouldn't be crazy to think he's got a girlfriend.

526
00:21:25,247 --> 00:21:25,866
Well,
that's true,

527
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,844
but yesterday they went out of their way to act like they didn't know each other.

528
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,019
I'll meet you here ten minutes before the, uh, lunch recess.

529
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:40,656
Thank you.

530
00:21:40,673 --> 00:21:41,315
Sure.

531
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:44,789
Mr. Hammond, when...

532
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:46,377
your daughter Jessica was born,

533
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,456
you arranged for a trust fund to protect her inheritance.

534
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:52,825
Can you tell me how much that fund is worth today?

535
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,759
I would say approximately $42 million.

536
00:21:56,837 --> 00:21:57,706
$42 million.

537
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:00,324
And upon her death,

538
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:02,010
who would inherit that money?

539
00:22:02,907 --> 00:22:03,653
Her husband.

540
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:06,214
With all due respect,
Mr. Hammond, doesn't that...

541
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:07,277
give you pause?

542
00:22:07,423 --> 00:22:08,189
Objection, Your Honor.

543
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,420
The district attorney is asking for an opinion

544
00:22:10,471 --> 00:22:12,904
that has no relevance to the case before this court.

545
00:22:13,072 --> 00:22:13,672
Overruled.

546
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:14,872
I'll allow it.

547
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,294
H-Have you ever met my son-in-law, sir?

548
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:21,135
He came into my office 12 years ago.

549
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:24,334
He had on a sport coat that looked like it probably cost.

550
00:22:24,838 --> 00:22:27,680
.. $60 and a tie that cost about ten,

551
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,070
and he said, "I'd like to work for you, sir.

552
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:32,512
"I'd like to learn from you, sir,

553
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:35,950
I'd like to learn how to make money." And, uh,

554
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:39,335
I asked him the question I ask everyone who says they want to work for me.

555
00:22:39,386 --> 00:22:40,205
I asked,

556
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:42,352
"What are you willing to do?

557
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:47,872
" And he said, "I'm willing to do anything, sir." And he was telling the truth.

558
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:49,574
For the next year and a half,

559
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:50,919
he unstopped toilets,

560
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,195
he delivered mail,

561
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:53,991
he ran errands,

562
00:22:54,378 --> 00:22:55,629
he brought everyone lunch.

563
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,074
He was the first one there in the morning and the last one to leave at night.

564
00:23:00,321 --> 00:23:01,668
He knew nothing about finance.

565
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:03,105
But after 18 months,

566
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:04,654
he was teaching me things.

567
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:08,659
That's who my son-in-law is.

568
00:23:09,202 --> 00:23:09,802
And...

569
00:23:10,274 --> 00:23:12,209
how did he come to meet your daughter?

570
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:14,804
Well, I introduced them.

571
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:15,910
Uh...

572
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,869
put them together anyway.

573
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:20,662
And how did that come about?

574
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:22,919
From time to time in my business,

575
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,436
there are work-related functions.

576
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,286
Uh, charity events,

577
00:23:26,593 --> 00:23:27,348
award dinners.

578
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:30,745
I was always encouraging Stephen to go,

579
00:23:31,215 --> 00:23:32,450
but he would always decline.

580
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:36,268
Finally, he confessed to me that he was intimidated,

581
00:23:37,218 --> 00:23:38,552
afraid of making a fool of himself.

582
00:23:40,036 --> 00:23:41,306
Picking up the wrong fork,

583
00:23:41,811 --> 00:23:43,298
drinking from the wrong glass,

584
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:44,213
that sort of thing.

585
00:23:45,372 --> 00:23:49,875
While a man who looks like him certainly had no shortage of women in his life,

586
00:23:51,277 --> 00:23:53,818
he did let me know that none of them

587
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:58,084
were of a caliber he felt comfortable
bringing to a work-related function.

588
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:04,489
So I suggested that perhaps he should ask Jessica to accompany him.

589
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:05,413
And...

590
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:07,272
obviously, that worked out.

591
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:11,251
My Jessica...

592
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:17,816
...was asleep for the first 24 years of her life,

593
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,548
and then she met... this man,

594
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:24,307
and... and she...

595
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:32,369
I was...

596
00:24:32,485 --> 00:24:34,082
I was hoping that she would...

597
00:24:36,505 --> 00:24:37,418
have children.

598
00:24:40,694 --> 00:24:41,596
I know they both want...

599
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,225
desperately wanted children.

600
00:24:50,168 --> 00:24:51,194
I'm sorry.

601
00:24:53,889 --> 00:24:55,520
I've completely forgotten the question.

602
00:24:56,322 --> 00:24:57,403
The $42 million.

603
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,654
Doesn't it make you wonder?

604
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,449
About what?

605
00:25:18,955 --> 00:25:19,555
That's her.

606
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,485
You better go now.

607
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:28,506
I knew him in college;

608
00:25:28,557 --> 00:25:29,628
I haven't talked to him since then.

609
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:31,929
You went to school with him?

610
00:25:33,276 --> 00:25:35,047
No. He lived in town.

611
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:37,701
He worked at his stepfather's bar.

612
00:25:38,763 --> 00:25:42,278
Anyway, he was great looking back then, too,

613
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:44,293
and I knew my parents wouldn't approve, so...

614
00:25:45,562 --> 00:25:46,455
I had to have him.

615
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:48,016
You dated him?

616
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,217
You could call it dating.

617
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,081
It was more like sex and fighting.

618
00:25:52,716 --> 00:25:53,902
So wait, I'm confused.

619
00:25:54,455 --> 00:25:55,502
If you haven't talked to him in years,

620
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:56,798
why are you coming to court every day?

621
00:25:57,574 --> 00:25:58,305
Saw it in the papers.

622
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,350
See something like that,

623
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:02,250
and you know the people it happened to,

624
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:04,571
it freaks you out a little.

625
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:06,499
And I guess I felt...

626
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:08,325
a little responsible.

627
00:26:08,885 --> 00:26:09,691
What do you mean?

628
00:26:11,306 --> 00:26:12,270
I sort of introduced them.

629
00:26:12,953 --> 00:26:14,311
Wait a second, I thought I read in the paper,

630
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,331
uh, that the dad introduced them,

631
00:26:17,382 --> 00:26:18,566
that they met through work or something.

632
00:26:19,114 --> 00:26:19,825
I read that, too.

633
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:21,748
The truth is,

634
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,412
we were all at the country club one night, and...

635
00:26:25,132 --> 00:26:26,521
This was, like, 13 years ago,

636
00:26:26,572 --> 00:26:28,659
way before he ever started working for her father.

637
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:31,553
Oh, God, Jess didn't even notice Stephen.

638
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:33,546
I mean, why would she?
He was the bartender.

639
00:26:34,948 --> 00:26:36,822
But she definitely made an impression on him.

640
00:26:37,502 --> 00:26:38,177
What do you mean?

641
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,282
Well, he heard she had serious money.

642
00:26:40,989 --> 00:26:43,120
So after the party, he wanted to know everything about her.

643
00:26:43,432 --> 00:26:45,197
What did she like to do,
what kind of guys did she like.

644
00:26:45,248 --> 00:26:47,845
I mean, he wanted to know everything there was to know about Jessie Hammond.

645
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:49,457
And this was 13 years ago.

646
00:26:50,113 --> 00:26:52,407
Mm-hmm. I told him he didn't have a chance  with her--

647
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:54,142
she was a real daddy's girl.

648
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:55,992
You know, only child,

649
00:26:56,332 --> 00:26:57,567
no mom, shy.

650
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:01,301
I guess he figured the key to Jess was her dad,

651
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:02,475
'cause the next thing I knew...

652
00:27:03,343 --> 00:27:04,209
he was working for him.

653
00:27:04,802 --> 00:27:06,535
Well, I still don't get it-- you knew the guy,

654
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:07,750
you had a thing with the guy,

655
00:27:08,231 --> 00:27:09,496
but that was some time ago,

656
00:27:09,604 --> 00:27:11,487
and yet here you are coming to court every day.

657
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:17,656
I told you, I guess I feel a little responsible.

658
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:20,274
Why?

659
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:23,543
I don't know, um,

660
00:27:24,154 --> 00:27:25,566
Stephen was asking me about Jessica for,

661
00:27:25,617 --> 00:27:26,571
like, the hundredth time.

662
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,879
You know, like, did I think she really had that much money,

663
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:29,600
that sort of thing,

664
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:30,531
like he's on a mission.

665
00:27:31,444 --> 00:27:33,019
And I told him to forget about it,

666
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,226
that it was never gonna happen--

667
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,190
I mean...

668
00:27:37,071 --> 00:27:38,299
that boy likes the bedroom.

669
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,286
I knew he was nailing me and, like, six other girls.

670
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:45,524
The thought of him getting married,

671
00:27:45,718 --> 00:27:46,977
the thought of him being exclusive,

672
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:50,231
I just... I didn't think he had it in him.

673
00:27:50,282 --> 00:27:51,437
And I told him so.

674
00:27:53,107 --> 00:27:55,445
And I told him that if he married Jess...

675
00:27:56,461 --> 00:27:57,250
she'd care.

676
00:27:57,999 --> 00:27:59,674
And her dad would care more.

677
00:28:01,661 --> 00:28:04,202
Anyway, I remember Stephen looked at me,

678
00:28:04,253 --> 00:28:04,986
and he said...

679
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,820
hey, a person would just have to marry her,

680
00:28:07,871 --> 00:28:09,759
he wouldn't necessarily have to stay married to her.

681
00:28:17,334 --> 00:28:18,479
Ask me what I know.

682
00:28:20,428 --> 00:28:21,165
Doesn't matter.

683
00:28:21,455 --> 00:28:22,534
You're right,
it was a plan.

684
00:28:22,585 --> 00:28:24,184
He's been working it since the early '90s.

685
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:25,791
The guy is a classic sociopath.

686
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,793
Allison, it doesn't matter.

687
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,071
Court the father, then court her.

688
00:28:30,195 --> 00:28:32,369
Marry her,
then kill her and take her money.

689
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:34,293
A girl he once knew,

690
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:35,289
an old lover,

691
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,076
she saw the whole thing happen.

692
00:28:37,473 --> 00:28:38,829
I believe you, Allison, but,

693
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,229
honestly, it does not matter.

694
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,895
It does!

695
00:28:41,946 --> 00:28:42,835
The jury is with him.

696
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:43,754
They're not with you.

697
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,297
This is what he's great at--

698
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,312
winning people over.

699
00:28:46,781 --> 00:28:48,622
You have to give them some evidence.

700
00:28:49,232 --> 00:28:50,589
This woman, I know,

701
00:28:50,723 --> 00:28:53,651
Scanlon seems to think most of what she has to offer is hearsay,

702
00:28:53,896 --> 00:28:57,905
but I think you take it to the judge, you tell him what this woman...

703
00:28:57,956 --> 00:28:58,729
Allison.

704
00:29:00,426 --> 00:29:02,826
We finished our closing arguments over an hour ago.

705
00:29:02,948 --> 00:29:04,641
The case is with the jury; it's over.

706
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:08,912
Go home.

707
00:29:09,641 --> 00:29:11,050
And let's both try to get a good night's sleep.

708
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:20,518
Absolutely, there's not a doubt in my mind.

709
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,440
Even if I'm off by an hour,

710
00:29:24,551 --> 00:29:27,238
I will definitely be in the office by 3:00.

711
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,782
No, tomorrow, I'll be done.

712
00:29:32,806 --> 00:29:34,003
Okay, tomorrow.

713
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:37,775
They can't exist without me for three days.

714
00:29:38,858 --> 00:29:39,950
I guess that's the good news.

715
00:29:40,718 --> 00:29:43,162
How can you be so sure he'll be back at the office by 3:00?

716
00:29:43,494 --> 00:29:45,987
Aren't deliberations starting tomorrow?

717
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:48,056
Darling, there's nothing to deliberate.

718
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:51,163
The only suspense is how long it's gonna take to count the hands.

719
00:29:52,088 --> 00:29:53,989
Is that what you've been upset about since you got home?

720
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:57,227
Al, talk to me.

721
00:30:08,218 --> 00:30:09,030
I can't.

722
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:14,626
No! Please, God!

723
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,154
No! I love you!

724
00:30:17,822 --> 00:30:19,436
No! Please, don't!

725
00:30:20,014 --> 00:30:21,560
Please! Oh, my God!

726
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:23,966
I love you! Please!

727
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:44,109
Hey... you okay?

728
00:30:44,514 --> 00:30:45,280
Yeah.

729
00:30:46,197 --> 00:30:47,596
Oh, yeah, I'm okay,

730
00:30:47,657 --> 00:30:51,488
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

731
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,239
Oh, I don't know,

732
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:55,443
I don't know.

733
00:30:56,198 --> 00:30:56,852
Don't ask me;

734
00:30:57,138 --> 00:30:57,950
I can't tell you.

735
00:30:58,094 --> 00:30:59,072
I can't talk about it.

736
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:00,348
What do you mean?

737
00:31:00,486 --> 00:31:01,416
What is there not to talk about?

738
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:08,010
Oh.

739
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:17,366
It's okay.

740
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:21,004
Really, I'm okay.

741
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:22,492
Just go back to sleep.

742
00:31:30,441 --> 00:31:31,678
Hey, whatcha doing?

743
00:31:33,151 --> 00:31:34,058
Waiting for you to wake up.

744
00:31:35,868 --> 00:31:37,506
Come on, go back to sleep.

745
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:38,675
I need you to tell me.

746
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:41,409
Tell you what?

747
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:44,728
You're dreaming.

748
00:31:45,902 --> 00:31:46,888
Every night.

749
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:53,607
If this case were as simple as the one that's being presented in that courtroom,

750
00:31:53,658 --> 00:31:55,148
there'd be nothing for you to dream about.

751
00:32:00,091 --> 00:32:00,999
So?

752
00:32:01,585 --> 00:32:02,820
So I want to know what you're seeing.

753
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,450
I want to know what you know.

754
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:09,149
I can't tell you what I know.

755
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:11,425
I wish I could.

756
00:32:12,387 --> 00:32:14,757
I wish it would make a difference, but...

757
00:32:17,221 --> 00:32:18,381
it just doesn't.

758
00:32:20,016 --> 00:32:21,843
I know you all have lives and other things to do,

759
00:32:21,894 --> 00:32:23,919
so as your newly elected foreman,

760
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,457
I'd like to get the ball rolling.

761
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:26,778
I'd also like to, uh,

762
00:32:26,829 --> 00:32:29,376
take a test vote just to see where we stand.

763
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:32,720
Remember, there's only one charge here:

764
00:32:33,175 --> 00:32:37,493
guilty or not guilty due to criminally negligent homicide.

765
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:40,614
So can I see some hands?

766
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,184
Not guilty.

767
00:32:48,121 --> 00:32:49,400
Uh, Mr. Dubois,

768
00:32:50,028 --> 00:32:50,968
I said "not guilty."

769
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,994
That means, you know,

770
00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:53,831
he didn't do it.

771
00:32:54,003 --> 00:32:55,420
Yes, I understood the question.

772
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,567
Easy, everyone.

773
00:32:58,704 --> 00:33:00,413
The man is entitled to his opinion.

774
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,473
Yeah, well, I think the man wasn't in the same courtroom as everyone else.

775
00:33:04,126 --> 00:33:07,183
Are you telling me that you really think that this guy did something wrong?

776
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:08,883
No, I just... I...

777
00:33:09,512 --> 00:33:10,422
I think we have a job to do,

778
00:33:10,473 --> 00:33:12,207
and we have to do it carefully,

779
00:33:12,265 --> 00:33:12,865
that's all.

780
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:14,646
Then I'd like to see your hand.

781
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:15,850
We're here to vote.

782
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,288
That is your job.

783
00:33:17,932 --> 00:33:19,155
No, it isn't, Mack.

784
00:33:19,495 --> 00:33:20,797
I'm here to examine the evidence,

785
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,413
deliberate, make a decision.

786
00:33:23,074 --> 00:33:24,413
My job's to do all those things.

787
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:25,658
Examine the evidence?

788
00:33:26,018 --> 00:33:26,814
What evidence?

789
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:31,167
Can you show me a scrap of evidence that tells me that this guy did anything--

790
00:33:31,562 --> 00:33:32,162
anything--

791
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:33,323
to hurt his wife?

792
00:33:33,746 --> 00:33:35,190
No, I can't. Not now.

793
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:35,996
Maybe never.

794
00:33:36,196 --> 00:33:39,349
But his wife is dead, and he is staring at a potful of money.

795
00:33:39,749 --> 00:33:42,847
And I just know that I'd feel a lot more comfortable telling this guy he's

796
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:47,433
free to walk if I knew that I'd spent a little bit of time just going over

797
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:51,216
everything that I'd heard just in case there's something,

798
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:53,355
something that we might've missed.

799
00:33:54,764 --> 00:33:58,214
You know, I wouldn't mind a quick review of everything just to be sure.

800
00:33:58,752 --> 00:34:00,321
A quick review of everything, huh?

801
00:34:01,242 --> 00:34:06,258
Okay, so, Stephen Garner said that he and his wife Jessica left their home...

802
00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:10,084
9:00 p.m. to drive up to Lake Prescott.

803
00:34:36,513 --> 00:34:37,215
No word yet.

804
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:38,899
Excuse me?

805
00:34:39,775 --> 00:34:41,547
The jury-- they're still deliberating.

806
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,137
Who knows?
Maybe we do have a chance.

807
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,680
I'm sorry.
Was there something else?

808
00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:48,843
This box.

809
00:34:49,585 --> 00:34:50,355
Yeah, it's the case file:

810
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,067
Phoenix, Arizona vs. Stephen Garner.

811
00:34:53,264 --> 00:34:54,842
Care to take a look?
Can't do any harm now.

812
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,658
Yeah, I-I wouldn't mind.

813
00:34:58,502 --> 00:34:59,183
Go ahead.

814
00:34:59,485 --> 00:35:00,316
Have a party.

815
00:36:02,273 --> 00:36:03,197
I need to speak with you.

816
00:36:03,476 --> 00:36:04,076
Speak.

817
00:36:04,317 --> 00:36:06,122
I think I know where she is--
her body, I mean.

818
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:08,612
He killed her in the woods--
a place called the Mazatzal Mountains.

819
00:36:09,484 --> 00:36:12,131
The reason you couldn't find her in the lake is she never got on that boat.

820
00:36:13,812 --> 00:36:14,595
Say something.

821
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,063
The jury's back.

822
00:36:22,326 --> 00:36:23,417
In the matter of the State vs.

823
00:36:23,468 --> 00:36:27,249
Stephen Garneron the charge of criminally negligent homicide, how do you find?

824
00:36:31,038 --> 00:36:32,061
We find the defendant...

825
00:36:33,122 --> 00:36:33,963
not guilty.

826
00:36:38,408 --> 00:36:39,653
So say you all, Mr. Foreman?

827
00:36:40,336 --> 00:36:41,394
So say we all.

828
00:36:56,569 --> 00:36:58,670
And if you do this a hundred times every night,

829
00:36:59,007 --> 00:37:01,902
your hair will never tangle and it will always shine.

830
00:37:02,797 --> 00:37:03,962
A whole hundred?

831
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,926
A whole hundred.

832
00:37:06,614 --> 00:37:07,863
Will it shine like yours?

833
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:08,951
Uh-huh.

834
00:37:09,462 --> 00:37:10,245
Cool...

835
00:37:15,687 --> 00:37:16,658
Come on, girls.

836
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,287
It's already ten minutes past your bedtime.

837
00:37:22,693 --> 00:37:23,410
Hello?

838
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:24,770
Want to hear something funny?

839
00:37:25,386 --> 00:37:26,525
I've been doing some checking.

840
00:37:26,675 --> 00:37:28,870
The Hammond family has a hunting lodge in the mountains.

841
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:30,470
It's been in the family for 50 years.

842
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:32,087
Guess what town it's in?

843
00:37:32,702 --> 00:37:33,529
Mazatzal.

844
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:35,451
I'm going to take a drive out there tomorrow,

845
00:37:35,502 --> 00:37:36,342
take a look around.

846
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,112
Don't know what I'll do if I find anything.

847
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:41,990
It's never easy to charge a man a second time around for something he's

848
00:37:42,044 --> 00:37:43,286
already been acquitted of,

849
00:37:43,393 --> 00:37:45,929
but I guess I'll cross that bridge when I come to it...

850
00:37:46,262 --> 00:37:47,706
if I come to it.

851
00:37:52,018 --> 00:37:53,481
What do you think he's thinking right now?

852
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:56,677
He's gloating.

853
00:37:58,412 --> 00:37:59,686
He's thinking about everything he did,

854
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:01,525
everything he was willing to do.

855
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:03,017
He's thinking about...

856
00:38:04,271 --> 00:38:05,256
how smart he is...

857
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:07,529
how dumb we are.

858
00:38:09,899 --> 00:38:11,764
And he's hoping with all his might...

859
00:38:13,219 --> 00:38:16,584
that there really is no hell.

860
00:38:23,756 --> 00:38:25,306
No! No! God, no!

861
00:38:25,822 --> 00:38:28,124
Please, don't! No!

862
00:38:29,352 --> 00:38:30,870
God, please, no!

863
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,257
No! Don't!

864
00:38:33,803 --> 00:38:34,702
No!

865
00:38:55,775 --> 00:38:56,662
Did you get your warrant?

866
00:38:57,539 --> 00:38:58,815
It's all public conservation land.

867
00:38:58,924 --> 00:38:59,998
The Hammonds donated it.

868
00:39:00,985 --> 00:39:01,585
What's that?

869
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:03,574
Deer carcasses.

870
00:39:03,707 --> 00:39:05,106
They're buried all up and down these woods.

871
00:39:05,608 --> 00:39:06,534
Makes it hard going.

872
00:39:06,683 --> 00:39:07,834
The dogs are getting confused.

873
00:39:09,117 --> 00:39:10,222
You think he wants his land back?

874
00:39:10,401 --> 00:39:11,797
What in the hell is going on here?

875
00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:12,469
Mr. Hammond...

876
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,295
What are you doing?

877
00:39:13,346 --> 00:39:15,046
My son-in-law was acquitted yesterday.

878
00:39:15,097 --> 00:39:17,370
Sir, we're only attempting to follow up on every lead...

879
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,569
Why do you feel the need to continue this obsession,

880
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,324
this harassment?

881
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:22,398
My daughter fell out of a boat, not...

882
00:39:22,449 --> 00:39:24,024
- Please, Mr. Hammond...
- Detective!

883
00:39:27,528 --> 00:39:28,313
Excuse me.

884
00:39:34,527 --> 00:39:35,144
We got something.

885
00:39:39,224 --> 00:39:39,830
What is it?

886
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:47,664
Oh, crap.

887
00:39:59,323 --> 00:40:00,450
That's Jessie's ring.

888
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:04,694
Mr. Hammond, we should go inside and let the officers work...

889
00:40:05,991 --> 00:40:07,325
Oh, this bag's full of body parts.

890
00:40:09,146 --> 00:40:09,868
Mr. Hammond...

891
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,061
One, two, three, four,

892
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,894
I declare a thumb war.

893
00:40:17,851 --> 00:40:20,060
I win! I'm the champion of the world!

894
00:40:20,161 --> 00:40:21,404
Ha, ha, you lose.

895
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:22,857
I'm the co-champion of the world!

896
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:26,938
All right,
world champions!

897
00:40:27,781 --> 00:40:31,058
Daddy, are we all driving all together tomorrow?

898
00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:33,741
No, not tomorrow, sweetie.
Jury duty's over.

899
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,038
So did you send somebody to jail,

900
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:41,894
or did they not do it?

901
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:44,741
I'll get that.

902
00:40:46,675 --> 00:40:48,157
Uh, well, he did do it...

903
00:40:48,921 --> 00:40:50,957
but no, he's not going to jail.
Not yet.

904
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:52,574
But that doesn't make sense.

905
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,245
It's complicated, sweetie.

906
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:56,320
It's too complicated for 9:00.

907
00:40:57,802 --> 00:40:58,740
Now, everybody sleep.

908
00:40:59,687 --> 00:41:00,287
Night, Daddy.

909
00:41:00,857 --> 00:41:01,543
Night, Daddy.

910
00:41:09,206 --> 00:41:10,049
What? What's going on?

911
00:41:16,477 --> 00:41:17,632
I guess a couple hours ago,

912
00:41:18,082 --> 00:41:19,301
the father, Mr. Hammond,

913
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:24,468
went into Devalos' office and... turned himself in.

914
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,060
What? What are you talking about?
Turned himself in for what?

915
00:41:31,303 --> 00:41:34,934
Apparently, he drove his son-in-law Stephen up to the woods.

916
00:41:37,522 --> 00:41:39,089
He gave him a three-minute head start,

917
00:41:39,195 --> 00:41:40,480
then hunted him down...

918
00:41:41,648 --> 00:41:42,394
and shot him.

919
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:46,534
He shot him 23 times.

920
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:00,561
But I'm the champion!

921
00:42:00,656 --> 00:42:01,535
I beat Daddy!

922
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,589
We're co-champions,
stupid.

923
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:04,909
That means we're both champions.

924
00:42:05,255 --> 00:42:05,934
I'll get it.

925
00:42:06,096 --> 00:42:06,696
No, no...

926
00:42:06,728 --> 00:42:07,734
Nuh-uh.

927
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:09,936
Nuh-uh.

928
00:42:09,997 --> 00:42:11,583
Hey, girls!
Come on, it's time for bed.

929
00:42:11,877 --> 00:42:12,890
I beat Daddy...

930
00:42:13,013 --> 00:42:14,423
