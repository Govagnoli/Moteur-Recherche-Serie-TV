2
00:00:05,863 --> 00:00:06,863
oh, my god...

3
00:00:07,487 --> 00:00:09,128
this is good.

4
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:16,613
I mean... really good.

5
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:18,612
It's delicious.

6
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:20,800
What did you say this was again?

7
00:00:22,206 --> 00:00:23,300
I didn't, actually.

8
00:00:24,378 --> 00:00:25,362
It's just an old recipe.

9
00:00:26,284 --> 00:00:28,144
I'm sorry, I...

10
00:00:28,284 --> 00:00:30,238
haven't seen you in...

11
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:32,112
well, gosh,
it seems like forever.

12
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,800
All I can talk about is
the food.

13
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:36,550
How have you been?

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,456
Well.
Very well, as a
matter of fact.

15
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:42,128
And what about you?

16
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:45,112
I see you went and
got yourself inked up.

17
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,940
Oh... (quiet laugh)
yeah.

18
00:00:50,113 --> 00:00:53,503
Me and the boys had a little bit
too much to drink one night.

19
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:56,237
When I woke up,
I had this tattoo.

20
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:06,378
I'm sorry.
I really hate to nag, but, uh,

21
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:09,112
this is the best thing
I've ever tasted.

22
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,113
Please, you have to tell me
what it is.

23
00:01:12,722 --> 00:01:14,363
Sometimes it's better
not to know.

24
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:17,987
Come on, what is it?
Filet? Tenderloin?

25
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:19,925
You're sure you want
me to tell you?

26
00:01:20,362 --> 00:01:21,550
Oh, I'm sure.

27
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,987
Okay. But I'm
surprised
you haven't figured
it out yet.

28
00:01:25,941 --> 00:01:27,659
That meat you're
enjoying so much?

29
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,191
The secret
ingredient...
is you.

30
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:34,737
we're eating you.

31
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,363
Your right leg,
to be exact.

32
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,269
Look for yourself.
You'll see.

灵媒缉凶  第4季 第6集</font>

35
00:02:48,393 --> 00:02:52,175
Well, there was definitely
nothing literal about my dream.

36
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:53,690
But the guy in it,
he, he was young.

37
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,347
He was like 20, 21, uh...

38
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:59,253
oh, he had dark, shaggy hair.

39
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,690
Oh, he also had a, uh, a tattoo
on his arm.

40
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,503
It was like an eight ball
with fire all around it.

41
00:03:07,315 --> 00:03:08,440
I don't know what to tell you,
allison.

42
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,284
No one matching that description
has been reported missing.

43
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:11,800
Or turned up dead.

44
00:03:12,363 --> 00:03:14,206
lee, can you hold on a second?

45
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:15,721
I'm getting another call. Sorry.

46
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:18,925
Hello?

47
00:03:19,238 --> 00:03:22,050
Hello. Is this allison dubois?

48
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:22,999
Yes?

49
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:26,222
This is mrs. Desai from
the ubient credit corporation.

50
00:03:26,222 --> 00:03:30,675
I'm calling to inform you
that your accois more
than 90 days past due.

51
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:33,737
Well, I appreciate
your heads up, mrs. Desai.

52
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:35,112
But you know what?
We already know that.

53
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:37,738
Someone from your company has
been nice enough

54
00:03:37,738 --> 00:03:41,628
to call us every single day
to remind us.

55
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:44,425
Now, if you can't arrange to
make the minimum payment soon,

56
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:47,441
I'm afraid your credit cards are
going to be frozen.

57
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,534
Yeah, you know what?
We know that, too.

58
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:53,644
we want to pay you.
We really do.

59
00:03:53,644 --> 00:03:55,425
And we will, as soon as we can.

60
00:03:55,425 --> 00:03:57,237
I'm sorry,
I have to get off now.

61
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,316
'Cause I have another call.

62
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,175
Lee, sorry about that.

63
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,737
Uh, no problem.
I'll keep an eye out, okay?

64
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,112
Thanks.

65
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:08,175
So, you're fairly confident

66
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:11,237
that cassandra baldwin would
make a good juror?

67
00:04:11,237 --> 00:04:13,300
She's perfect for you.

68
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:15,613
I think thatilhe wl
vote to acquit.

69
00:04:17,503 --> 00:04:18,550
Sir?

70
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:20,300
Hm...?

71
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:23,050
I'm sorry, allison.
The truth is,

72
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,253
my mind isn't really
on this jury at the moment.

73
00:04:28,237 --> 00:04:30,472
actually, there's something else

74
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:31,863
I would like to discuss
with you.

75
00:04:35,112 --> 00:04:37,753
I had dinner last night with an
old colleague-- jed garrity. 

76
00:04:37,753 --> 00:04:39,800
He was a judge
when I was a junior prosecutor.

77
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,581
He's served
as a state senator for...

78
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:43,999
more than a decade now.

79
00:04:44,753 --> 00:04:46,175
It was quite
an interesting evening.

80
00:04:46,175 --> 00:04:48,238
Apparently,
there's some dissatisfaction

81
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:49,800
with the way tom van dyke is

82
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,675
handling himself
as district attorney.

83
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,253
Imagine that.

84
00:04:54,425 --> 00:04:56,300
Van dyke is up
for reelection soon.

85
00:04:57,675 --> 00:04:59,488
There are some people
who are disappointed

86
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:01,144
that he's running unopposed.

87
00:05:01,144 --> 00:05:02,925
Senator garrity among them.

88
00:05:04,863 --> 00:05:06,253
Last night, garrity asked me
if I'd be interested

89
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:07,988
in throwing my hat
into the ring.

90
00:05:08,363 --> 00:05:09,800
So what did you say?

91
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,253
Oh, I told him
that I was, uh, content

92
00:05:12,253 --> 00:05:15,050
to languish in a rented office
on the edge of downtown.

93
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,518
I also told him that I...

94
00:05:16,518 --> 00:05:18,800
always imagined spending
the autumn of my career

95
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,362
picking up cases on a
catch-as-catch-can basis.

96
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,112
What do you think
I said?

97
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
I imld h I'm excited.

98
00:05:26,738 --> 00:05:29,785
I told him that I miss serving
the city of phoenix.

99
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:32,894
I, uh, that I'd be thrilled
to stand for the job.

100
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:35,238
Oh, that's great news.
I'm so happy for you.

101
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:37,597
I have to admit
I'm happy for me, too.

102
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:38,862
But I'm trying to keep it
in check.

103
00:05:38,862 --> 00:05:39,925
This isn't going to be easy.

104
00:05:40,753 --> 00:05:43,191
The logistics of getting
a campaign up and running

105
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:46,582
at this late date-- frankly,
they're... daunting.

106
00:05:46,582 --> 00:05:47,738
And... (sighs heavily)

107
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:50,800
the senator's support
is conditional.

108
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,999
Before he's willing
to endorse me,

109
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:54,956
he has concerns
that need to be addressed,

110
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:56,378
and chief among them is you.

111
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:58,612
Hey, if it helps you
get your job back,

112
00:05:58,612 --> 00:06:02,362
I will happily crawl
under a rock
until after the election.

113
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,175
well, I appreciate the offer,

114
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:06,925
but I don't think that's
a realistic possibility.

115
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:09,112
Reporters are quite good
at looking under rocks.

116
00:06:09,425 --> 00:06:10,363
Yeah.

117
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,613
Senator garrity
would like to meet you.

118
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:14,565
Tonight, as a matter of fact.

119
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:17,737
If you're willing, the three
of us could have dinner.

120
00:06:17,737 --> 00:06:19,753
The senator could ask you
his questions,

121
00:06:19,753 --> 00:06:20,550
and, hopefully...

122
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:21,999
that'll be that.

123
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,738
Dad.
Yeah?

124
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:25,815
I need to call hannah back,

125
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:26,800
and bridgette won't get off
the phone.

126
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Well, I'm in the middle
of something, ariel.

127
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,050
Just be patient.

128
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,332
Yeah, but she's been on the
phone for, like, ten minutes.

129
00:06:32,332 --> 00:06:33,300
Who's she talking to?

130
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,237
I don't know--

131
00:06:34,237 --> 00:06:36,425
some weird guy-- but she won't
say when she'll be done.

132
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,581
well, just hold on for
a couple minutes, okay?

133
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:41,800
I'm sure she'll be off soon.

134
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,925
Really? You got to call somebody
in niagara falls?

135
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:46,378
How many times?

136
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:47,925
Bridgette,
who are you talking to?

137
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:51,456
Can you hold on a
second, please?

138
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:53,144
Mr. Reshmi.

139
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:56,050
Have you ever talked
to anybody in alaska?

140
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,769
Bridgette,
who is mr. Reshmi?

141
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:00,238
He's the credit
card man.

142
00:07:00,238 --> 00:07:02,191
You're talking to somebody
from the credit card company?

143
00:07:03,112 --> 00:07:03,999
Give me the phone.

144
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:06,207
But we were in
the middle of talking.

145
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:07,769
Mr. Reshmi...

146
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,737
hi.
Yeah, my name is
joseph dubois.

147
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:13,222
I wonder if your supervisor
would be interested in learning

148
00:07:13,222 --> 00:07:14,612
you've spent
the last ten minutes

149
00:07:14,612 --> 00:07:16,925
chatting with a nine year old.

150
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,503
That's right, nine.

151
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:22,175
Well, all right,
let me be really clear
about something,

152
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,737
I don't want you
calling here again.

153
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:25,316
I don't want you
harassing my family.

154
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,050
And if it continues,
then I'm going to call
the authorities.

155
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:31,753
Good-bye.

156
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:36,800
A hiker's dog sniffed him
out of a shallow grave

157
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,050
in boyce park
this morning.

158
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,769
Somebody stabbed him
a couple dozen times,

159
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:41,800
then they dissected him
with a chain saw.

160
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,300
The best bet is
your friend here died

161
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,925
somewhere close
to midnight.

162
00:07:49,613 --> 00:07:51,440
That's the same tattoo
from my dream.

163
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,425
Now, what would really
be helpful would be

164
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:57,113
if you could give me a complete
description of this guy.

165
00:07:57,113 --> 00:07:58,721
A little something
more than, uh,

166
00:07:58,721 --> 00:08:01,675
four feet tall, no arms,
no legs, no head.

167
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:04,300
You know, I could probably
also give you the description

168
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,425
of the guy who did
this to him.

169
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:07,175
What are you talking about?
You saw the murder?

170
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:07,999
You never mentioned that.

171
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:10,425
Well, not exactly.
It wasn't realistic.

172
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:11,425
But there was a man
in the dream
who was definitely

173
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:13,581
interested in his limbs.

174
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:15,129
He wanted them...

175
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:18,113
for food.

176
00:08:22,956 --> 00:08:24,363
Hubba, hubba.

177
00:08:24,363 --> 00:08:25,999
A hubba from the hubba.

178
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:26,987
Well, that's good.

179
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:28,628
But it's not too hubba, right?

180
00:08:28,628 --> 00:08:30,581
Mm, why do you ask?

181
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:34,128
Well, devalos is too polite
to say anything,

182
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:36,503
but I'm getting the feeling that
this endorsement hangs

183
00:08:36,503 --> 00:08:37,925
on whether or not
this garrity guy

184
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:39,815
thinks I'm a complete nut job.

185
00:08:40,456 --> 00:08:42,050
I want to look nice...

186
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:43,675
but sane.

187
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,863
Well, you look very nice.
Very sane.

188
00:08:48,206 --> 00:08:49,487
But I do have to ask:

189
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,128
Are you sure that you are okay

190
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:53,050
with devalos campaigning
for his old job?

191
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:55,050
What are you talking about?

192
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:59,206
Well, campaigns mean publicity.
And publicity means reporters.

193
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:01,999
Lots and lots of reporters.

194
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,925
Asking questions,
writing things about you.

195
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:07,316
It wasn't exactly a party
the first time around.

196
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:09,144
Well, I don't feel like
I have a choice.

197
00:09:09,472 --> 00:09:12,300
Devalos isn't asking for my
permission to run for office.

198
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,706
He's asking for my help.

199
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:16,706
I know he's not thrilled
of what he's doing right now.

200
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,597
And I feel partially responsible
for that.

201
00:09:19,597 --> 00:09:22,675
I'd really like help him get
back the one job in the world

202
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:24,237
that makes him truly happy.

203
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:35,800
Allison.
You look lovely.

204
00:09:36,753 --> 00:09:37,612
Thank you.

205
00:09:37,612 --> 00:09:38,238
Jed...

206
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,128
 the secret ingredient
is you.

207
00:09:44,128 --> 00:09:47,300
 Allison dubois,
I'd like you to meet
senator jed garrity.

208
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:54,315
Hey.Hi.

209
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,487
Are the girls in bed?

210
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:57,440
Uh, ariel'sdoing homework.

211
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,894
Bridgette and marieare asleep.

212
00:09:58,894 --> 00:10:00,175
How'd dinner go?Oh...

213
00:10:00,628 --> 00:10:03,425
I passed musterwith the senator.
He's going to endorse devalos.

214
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:05,425
They're scheduling a pressconference for friday.

215
00:10:06,347 --> 00:10:07,269
Oh, so that's a win, right?

216
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:08,441
Yeah, it's great.

217
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,238
I even managed to getthrough the meal
without accusing garrityof murder.

218
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:19,471
You know, I spentthe whole afternoon
with a policesketch artist,

219
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:24,191
giving hima perfect description
of an arizonastate senator.

220
00:10:27,581 --> 00:10:29,378
what if they distributethat sketch?

221
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,362
who are you calling?
Scanlon.

222
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,738
I got to stop them
before they putthat sketch out.

223
00:10:36,738 --> 00:10:39,128
Hi, this is detective...
(sighing): Ah, it'sgoing to voice mail.

224
00:10:39,441 --> 00:10:43,628
Lee.
It's allison.
Uh, listen, uh,

225
00:10:44,253 --> 00:10:47,363
that sketch that I did
with your artistthis afternoon?

226
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:51,113
Um, do me a favor anddon't distribute it
until I talk to you.

227
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:54,738
Okay, I guess I'll talkto you in the morning.

228
00:10:57,894 --> 00:10:59,550
your mom's going to betied up most of the day,

229
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,175
so I'll be picking you upthis afternoon, okay?

230
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,425
Okay, daddy.

231
00:11:02,425 --> 00:11:04,175
All right, kiddo.Give me a kiss.

232
00:11:05,175 --> 00:11:06,300
ByE.

233
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,613
Daddy, how can we tellmr. Reshmi
that he needsto lock his back door?

234
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:13,800
Tell who what?

235
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,316
Mr. Reshmi.

236
00:11:15,316 --> 00:11:18,988
I had a dream that somebody
broke into the placewhere he lives.

237
00:11:18,988 --> 00:11:19,628
Mr. Reshmi?

238
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,441
What, the credit card guy?

239
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:24,800
You had a dreamabout the credit card guy?

240
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,175
I saw his nameon the apartment door.

241
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:30,800
These robbers, they came in
from the sliding doorin the back.

242
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,190
I think they took a ring.

243
00:11:33,113 --> 00:11:35,613
Uh-huh, okay.
Well, look, bridge,

244
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:37,487
like you said,it was just a dream.

245
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:39,628
And even though you dreamt it,doesn't necessarily mean

246
00:11:39,628 --> 00:11:40,425
that it's going to happen.

247
00:11:40,425 --> 00:11:43,206
But I don't thinkit was just a dream.

248
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:45,362
I think we need to warn him.

249
00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:46,988
Warn him? Bridge...

250
00:11:47,316 --> 00:11:49,378
okay, even if it was one of,you know, those dreams...

251
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,612
there's no way of knowingwhether this is something that's

252
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,315
going to happen or somethingthat's already happened.

253
00:11:54,362 --> 00:11:57,613
But either way, it couldn't hurtto warn him, could it?

254
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:00,738
Bridge, I wouldn't have any ideahow to begin finding this guy.

255
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:03,613
I mean, these credit cardcompanies
have thousands of employees.

256
00:12:03,613 --> 00:12:06,112
Most of the call centersare in india now.

257
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:08,332
Well, we could call information.

258
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:12,441
Okay.
All right, when I gohome, I'll, um...

259
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,238
I'll call the companyand I'll, you know,

260
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:17,737
we'll try and give mr. Reshmia heads up, okay?

261
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,363
Thanks, daddy.

262
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,550
I think mr. Reshmi will bereally glad you called.

263
00:12:24,316 --> 00:12:25,691
Oh, and daddy,

264
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:28,160
make sure he knowsthat it's the back door, okay?

265
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,581
Okay.

266
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,488
Manuel devalos,an instinct for justice.

267
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:39,253
The campaign should
keep the public focusedon mr. Devalos' record.

268
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:41,988
Minimize anyquestions about
how he achieved it.

269
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,050
You can help us do that,mrs. Dubois, by being

270
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,488
very clearwhen you talk to the media.

271
00:12:49,987 --> 00:12:51,363
When the word "psychic" comesup, you should say that

272
00:12:51,363 --> 00:12:53,597
you've never been comfortablewith that term.

273
00:12:53,597 --> 00:12:55,988
In fact, you don'tconsider yourself psychic.

274
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,816
You've always beenhighly intuitive,

275
00:12:58,816 --> 00:13:03,753
and you've used that "intuition"
to solvea number of cases.

276
00:13:03,753 --> 00:13:05,863
Well, the newspaperswere very definite

277
00:13:05,863 --> 00:13:08,113
about what it was I didfor the district attorney.

278
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:11,518
You really thinkwe can get away
with pretendingI'm not what I am?

279
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,457
To be blunt, allison,

280
00:13:13,457 --> 00:13:15,675
I don't believe you arewhat you say you are.

281
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,175
Not exactly.

282
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:19,300
Now, that's not to saythat I think you're a fraud...

283
00:13:20,457 --> 00:13:23,237
but if I were to accept
everythingI hear about you,

284
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:25,316
well, that would make mequestion

285
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,999
too many of my dearly heldassumptions about the world.

286
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:32,425
And the last thing we wantto do is make people
question theirassumptions.

287
00:13:32,488 --> 00:13:35,988
So, we're tryingto find language

288
00:13:35,988 --> 00:13:39,816
that fits what you dointo the way most people think.

289
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:46,191
People like the word"intuitive."
They're comfortable with it.

290
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,363
I'm comfortable with it.

291
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:53,550
To me, it describessomeone who might
use unconventional techniques...

292
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,737
in your case, someone who mightmake leaps in logic

293
00:13:56,737 --> 00:13:58,999
that might elude otherinvestigators.

294
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:05,378
Occasionally, one of thoseleaps in logic
might come to you in a dream.

295
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,175
Is that a pretty fairdescription of what you do?

296
00:14:08,237 --> 00:14:09,925
Actually, that'san excellent description.

297
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:11,691
And I don'thave a problemwith it, either.

298
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,597
That, to me, sounds like someone

299
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:16,878
I would want to haveworking for the good guys.

300
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:22,753
Good.

301
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,691
man: I'm surrendering!
I'm surrendering!

302
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:40,878
my name's jed garrity.

303
00:14:40,878 --> 00:14:43,175
I'm a captain in the 101st
infantry unit.

304
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:45,050
I expect allrights due to me...

305
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
allison,  are you all right?

306
00:14:57,237 --> 00:14:58,315
I'm fine.

307
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,190
Sorry, sir, did you saysomething to me?

308
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:02,441
Garrity:I did.
I said I think we accomplished

309
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:04,675
a great deal here this morning,don't you?

310
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,175
Definitely.

311
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:17,113
I wanted to thank youfor making me 86

312
00:15:17,113 --> 00:15:18,643
those wanted postersdepicting our own

313
00:15:18,643 --> 00:15:21,378
senator garrityas a murder suspect.

314
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:23,941
We got a dna match for the body.

315
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:26,190
I assume this guydoesn't look familiar.

316
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,612
No, he does not.
This is the murder victim?

317
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:35,613
Turns outhe's from corpus christi.

318
00:15:35,613 --> 00:15:37,316
Name is gordon laroche.

319
00:15:37,612 --> 00:15:39,628
And seeing
as he was 59instead of 20 like

320
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:41,503
the guy you dreamed about,I figured that

321
00:15:41,503 --> 00:15:43,613
maybe you were wrongabout everything.

322
00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:44,800
Well, I guess I was.

323
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:49,237
This guy laroche must've had
the same tattoo as theman I dreamt about.

324
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,487
Well, this is great news.
Thank you.

325
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:56,550
Okay, so I never reached outto mr. Reshmi.

326
00:15:57,237 --> 00:15:59,237
Would you have spentthe afternoon dialing india?

327
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:01,999
No, probably not, but I wouldn'thave told our daughter

328
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:03,441
I was going to do itin the first place.

329
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:06,347
Well, I'm pretty
sure this falls underthe category of white lie.

330
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:12,737
As far as she's concerned,mr. Reshmi is buying a lock
for his back door right now.

331
00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:14,363
And I'm fine with that.

332
00:16:17,253 --> 00:16:18,487
What?

333
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:21,050
Nothing.You're proably right.
She'll probably never know.

334
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:24,362
Unless, of course, she hasanother dream about him.

335
00:16:25,112 --> 00:16:27,862
And if she does and she sees hisapartment's been broken into,

336
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,862
well, then she'll be positiveher father lied to her.

337
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:33,878
I'm not sure that ournine year old is really clear

338
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:36,738
on the difference betweena white lie and a regular one.

339
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:42,675
I guess I'm calling india.

340
00:16:58,378 --> 00:17:00,300
looks like the welcome committeegot to you.

341
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:03,300
You got a name,soldier?

342
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,175
Jed garrity.

343
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:08,300
I'm a captain.

344
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:16,738
Welcome to hell,captain garrity.

345
00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:18,487
I'm from corpus christi.

346
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:20,362
The name's laroche.

347
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,862
Gordon laroche.

348
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:32,488
Senator garrityand gordon laroche
knew each other.

349
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:35,440
They spent four years in aprisoner of war camp together.

350
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,363
They even marched side by side
in a memorial day paradein 2002.

351
00:17:39,363 --> 00:17:41,362
I can prove it:I found this
on the internetthis morning.

352
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,816
There isa connectionbetween these two men.

353
00:17:45,237 --> 00:17:46,175
I know.

354
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:48,550
I found outthey knew each other yesterday.

355
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,675
Turns out laroche hadquite the gambling problem.

356
00:17:52,925 --> 00:17:54,987
Owed moneyto bookies in four states.

357
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:56,550
I looked at his bankstatements yesterday--

358
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,472
even when larochewasn't working,

359
00:17:58,472 --> 00:18:00,738
he still had chunks of moneycoming in every so often.

360
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:02,409
$8,500 here, ten grand there.

361
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:05,800
A lot of that money camein the form of personal checks
from jed garrity.

362
00:18:07,113 --> 00:18:07,706
As a matter of fact,

363
00:18:07,706 --> 00:18:10,331
he sent larochea check for 15 grand
just last christmas.

364
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:13,425
So you thinkingwhat I'm thinking?

365
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:14,862
What's that?

366
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:16,050
Isn't it obvious?

367
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:19,378
Garrity was making down paymentson laroche's limbs.

368
00:18:19,378 --> 00:18:20,550
It's kind of an expensivemeal, but, hey,

369
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,550
when you've got a ravenousappetite for human flesh,

370
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,050
I guess you have to expectto pay through the nose.

371
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,690
(Laughs)great, it's comedy.

372
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,440
It's cop comedy,the best kind.
What do you want, allison?

373
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,815
It looks to melike every so often
senator garrity would

374
00:18:32,815 --> 00:18:34,331
try to bail his old warbuddy out of trouble.

375
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:36,175
Should I send a squad carover to his place?

376
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:37,409
Charge himwith being a nice guy?

377
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,300
You don't thinkit's a strange coincidence?

378
00:18:39,363 --> 00:18:43,128
Laroche turns up murderedin garrity'sometown?

379
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:43,863
Not really.

380
00:18:43,863 --> 00:18:45,737
Especially sincelaroche owed money

381
00:18:45,737 --> 00:18:47,613
to at least two loan sharksin phoenix.

382
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:49,800
Tell you what.

383
00:18:50,456 --> 00:18:52,112
I'm going to spend my morningworking the whole

384
00:18:52,112 --> 00:18:53,816
"shady guys larocheowed money to" thing.

385
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:55,425
I might even follow upon the fact that,

386
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,863
at 10:00 on the nighthe was killed,

387
00:18:56,863 --> 00:19:00,050
laroche's hotel manager
saw him get intothe passenger side

388
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,863
of a silver sedan and drive off.

389
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:04,613
But, hey, if you want to,uh, pursue your

390
00:19:04,613 --> 00:19:07,269
"senator cannibal" theory,by all means,

391
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:10,050
feel free.Be sure and let me
know if anything breaks.

392
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:17,956
Garrity:Allison?

393
00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:20,269
Hello.

394
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,565
Are you headed upto manny's office?

395
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:24,863
Yeah, I am.
Are you leaving?

396
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,050
I thought you two were workingtogether this morning.

397
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,988
We were, but ihad to reschedule.

398
00:19:28,988 --> 00:19:30,050
A friend of mine died.

399
00:19:30,487 --> 00:19:33,128
I've got to fly out to texas
 pay my respectsto his family.

400
00:19:33,363 --> 00:19:34,738
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

401
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:35,628
Were you close?

402
00:19:36,128 --> 00:19:37,565
Once upon a time.

403
00:19:38,237 --> 00:19:39,300
We were in the service together.

404
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:42,503
Well, I have to admit, sir,

405
00:19:42,503 --> 00:19:44,175
I know a little bitabout your background.

406
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:45,878
About the thingsthat you've lived through.

407
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,988
I imagine that the bonds thatyou develop
during war are very strong.

408
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,237
You have my condolences.

409
00:19:52,112 --> 00:19:53,238
That's very kind of you.

410
00:19:53,565 --> 00:19:56,425
But the truth is,I've been out of touch
with gordon for, oh...

411
00:19:58,112 --> 00:19:59,612
it must be almost 15 years now.

412
00:20:00,113 --> 00:20:02,175
Really? You didn't haveany contact at all?

413
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:06,175
I'd think that people who sharedthose kinds of experiences

414
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:08,988
would keep in touch.

415
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,315
Unfortunately, my friend and i
became very different people.

416
00:20:14,175 --> 00:20:15,159
We just drifted apart.

417
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:19,363
gordon and I saweach other at a funeral.

418
00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:22,800
Must've been,oh, '91 or so.

419
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,675
We haven't evenspoken since then.

420
00:20:27,972 --> 00:20:30,410
Allison, are you all right?
You look a little pale.

421
00:20:31,612 --> 00:20:32,753
I'm fine, sir.

422
00:20:44,238 --> 00:20:46,300
Suprabhaat, ubient credit,
bangalore.

423
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,738
Hi. Do you speak english?

424
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:50,050
Yes, sir.
How can I help you?

425
00:20:50,253 --> 00:20:53,550
Hi, I'm looking for an employeeof ubient credit.

426
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:56,300
I don't have a first name,but his last name is reshmi.

427
00:20:57,284 --> 00:20:59,738
Your office in bombay said thatthey thought that

428
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:00,738
he might work at this branch.

429
00:21:01,175 --> 00:21:02,691
That's right, sir.
Maneck reshmi.

430
00:21:02,691 --> 00:21:05,050
Let me see if he's started
his shift.

431
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:11,987
Hello, this is mr. Reshmi.

432
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:15,999
Hello, mr. Reshmi.

433
00:21:16,253 --> 00:21:18,999
My name is joe dubois.
I live in phoenix, arizona.

434
00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:21,160
Uh, you may recallyou had a conversation

435
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,315
with my daughter the other day.
Uh, she's nine.

436
00:21:24,815 --> 00:21:27,768
You spoke of all the interestingplaces that you get to call.

437
00:21:28,612 --> 00:21:30,999
Yes, sir.
I... think I remember.

438
00:21:31,675 --> 00:21:32,999
How can I help you?

439
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:34,362
Would you like
to arrange a payment?

440
00:21:34,362 --> 00:21:37,331
No, no, actually,uh, I am, uh...

441
00:21:38,284 --> 00:21:43,378
I'm callingto talk to you about...
home security.

442
00:21:43,378 --> 00:21:44,738
I don't think I understand.

443
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,113
I'm calling to ask youto buy a lock
for your back door.

444
00:21:51,347 --> 00:21:53,425
Uh, you know,the kind that-that, uh...

445
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:55,753
that makes it impossibleto slide open?

446
00:21:57,999 --> 00:21:59,113
you know whatI'm talking about, right?

447
00:21:59,113 --> 00:22:01,175
You-you have a sliding door?

448
00:22:01,175 --> 00:22:02,378
I do.

449
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,972
And you're calling me because
you'd like meto buy a lock for it?

450
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:07,691
That's right, I would.

451
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:10,503
Uh, I know this sounds, uh, odd.

452
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:11,925
I'm afraidI don't understand, sir.

453
00:22:12,363 --> 00:22:13,940
Are you tryingto sell me a product?

454
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:18,190
No, uh, I just want youto tell me
that you're going to buy a lock.

455
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:22,238
I'll tell you what.
I'll pay for it.

456
00:22:22,612 --> 00:22:23,363
Okay?

457
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,737
Uh, those locks are cheap,right?

458
00:22:26,737 --> 00:22:29,316
What, uh, what,about... about $25?

459
00:22:29,316 --> 00:22:31,112
I'll send you a personal check.

460
00:22:31,565 --> 00:22:32,988
If you are going
to send a check,

461
00:22:32,988 --> 00:22:34,999
why don't you let me credit it
to your account?

462
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:36,315
No, no, no, no, no.

463
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:38,191
No, it's for the lock.
You got to buy the lock.

464
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,999
Uh, I'm still confused,
mr. Dubois.

465
00:22:41,363 --> 00:22:43,425
Why exactly are you so concerned
with my home security?

466
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,503
Uh, look, it's, uh...

467
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:49,050
it's my daughter.

468
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:52,862
Um... my daughter liked you.

469
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:57,831
actually, she's worriedabout you,

470
00:22:57,831 --> 00:23:02,425
and-and... I promised
that I would try
to get ahold of you.

471
00:23:04,253 --> 00:23:06,175
So what do you say, huh?

472
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,440
It's not every day
that a strangerfrom another continent offers

473
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,096
to buy you a free lock.

474
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:18,425
so, you sent hima check anyway?

475
00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:20,831
Yeah, I sent hima check anyway.

476
00:23:21,222 --> 00:23:24,784
You know, I thinkI need to talk to devalos
to warn him about garrity.

477
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,050
Warn him about what exactly?

478
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,441
I don't know.
All of it-- the things I'vebeen seeing in my dreams.

479
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:32,597
Two days from now,

480
00:23:32,597 --> 00:23:34,487
devalos is supposedto stand shoulder-to-shoulder

481
00:23:34,487 --> 00:23:37,050
with garrity in frontof every reporter in phoenix.

482
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,999
Can you imaginewhat would happen

483
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:42,128
if garrity becomes a suspectin a murder investigation?

484
00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:44,675
It would be the endof devalos's political career.

485
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,999
Well, maybe,but there's nothing
that indicates garrity'sgoing to become a suspect.

486
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:50,175
What about this?

487
00:23:50,565 --> 00:23:51,487
The night of the murder,

488
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:53,238
someone picked up larochefrom his hotel

489
00:23:53,238 --> 00:23:54,550
in a silver sedan.

490
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,175
Garrity drives a silver sedan.

491
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,300
That's not exactlya smoking gun.

492
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:01,472
Every malein the developed world

493
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:03,628
has owned a silver sedanat some point in his life.

494
00:24:04,378 --> 00:24:06,191
Uh, that's pretty muchwhat scanlon said to me

495
00:24:06,191 --> 00:24:07,503
when I called himthis afternoon.

496
00:24:11,112 --> 00:24:12,378
All right, then whydo I keep seeing things

497
00:24:12,378 --> 00:24:14,581
that tell methat garrity's a bad guy?

498
00:24:14,581 --> 00:24:17,690
Why did he look me straightin the face and lie to me?

499
00:24:18,425 --> 00:24:21,128
He told me he hadn't beenin touch with laroche for years.

500
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,925
He sent him $15,000last christmas.

501
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:27,987
The two of them were in a paradeless than five years ago.

502
00:24:28,238 --> 00:24:29,999
What is he trying to hide?

503
00:24:42,737 --> 00:24:44,690
rhoades has dysentery.

504
00:24:44,988 --> 00:24:46,113
He's dying.

505
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,394
He's not going tolast more than a week.

506
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:56,988
Now, we can just let it happen,

507
00:24:58,238 --> 00:24:59,362
and who knowshow many of us are going

508
00:24:59,362 --> 00:25:01,300
to starve to deathbefore he dies.

509
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:05,300
or his death can mean something.

510
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,519
It can help us live.

511
00:25:10,253 --> 00:25:11,999
What are you talking about,captain garrity?

512
00:25:13,143 --> 00:25:16,675
If rhoades dies,how does that help us live?

513
00:25:16,675 --> 00:25:18,800
Are you sayingwhat I think you're saying?

514
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,925
We don't have any food.

515
00:25:21,738 --> 00:25:23,362
Rhoades is dying anyway,so we just...

516
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,675
...help him along.

517
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:30,050
Then we get to live.

518
00:25:32,378 --> 00:25:34,488
Man:No.
No way.

519
00:25:34,488 --> 00:25:35,863
I can't do that.

520
00:25:35,863 --> 00:25:38,831
We all have to be in on this.
We all have to agree.

521
00:25:39,863 --> 00:25:41,238
And we all have to eat.

522
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,300
God, I'm so hungry.

523
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,628
fine.

524
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,925
But which of us is goingto do it?

525
00:25:56,362 --> 00:25:58,097
Who's going to kill rhoades?

526
00:26:00,691 --> 00:26:02,300
We'll draw for it.

527
00:26:26,332 --> 00:26:27,691
Thank god.

528
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:38,503
two straws left,captain garrity.

529
00:26:40,644 --> 00:26:42,769
Looks likeit's between me and you.

530
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,487
Let's just dothis, laroche.

531
00:27:07,847 --> 00:27:08,862
where am I?

532
00:27:11,238 --> 00:27:15,112
am I home,captain garrity?

533
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:16,425
Not yet.

534
00:27:18,925 --> 00:27:19,999
but you will be soon.

535
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,394
Let me be sureI understand you.

536
00:27:40,363 --> 00:27:42,550
A young man namedmichael rhoades

537
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,488
died in a vietnameseprisoner-of-war camp

538
00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:46,800
more than 30 years ago,

539
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:51,565
and it's your beliefthat jed garrity murdered him

540
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,925
then... ate him.

541
00:27:53,925 --> 00:27:55,300
Garrity didn't want to do it.

542
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,628
He was starving to death.
All the prisoners were.

543
00:27:57,628 --> 00:27:59,738
He did it so the rest of themcould survive.

544
00:28:00,175 --> 00:28:01,878
And you think that all of thisis somehow connected

545
00:28:01,878 --> 00:28:04,175
to a murder that occurredfour days ago?

546
00:28:04,222 --> 00:28:06,253
Gordon laroche was in that campwith garrity.

547
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:10,378
He was in the room
when garrity killedmichael rhoades.

548
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:12,800
His gambling debtsare out of control.

549
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,175
Senator garritywas giving laroche money,
and lots of it.

550
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,159
What if they wereblackmail payments?

551
00:28:20,238 --> 00:28:22,050
What if laroche said to garrity

552
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,753
he was goingto expose their little secret

553
00:28:23,753 --> 00:28:25,925
if garrity didn't paid him off?

554
00:28:26,425 --> 00:28:27,253
Don't you thinkit's possible

555
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:31,253
garrity killed larocheto protect himself, his career?

556
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:32,238
No.

557
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,690
Actually, allison, I don'T.

558
00:28:35,987 --> 00:28:37,941
Even if I were willingto concede that,

559
00:28:37,941 --> 00:28:41,050
many years ago, in some of thedirest circumstances imaginable,

560
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,878
jed garrity did a terrible thingso that he could survive,

561
00:28:43,878 --> 00:28:46,190
I refuse to believethat he had anything to do

562
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,113
with the murderof that man scanlon found
the other night.

563
00:28:49,972 --> 00:28:52,988
This is a man that I've knownfor more than 20 years.

564
00:28:53,237 --> 00:28:55,644
Someone who has been decoratedwith the highest medal

565
00:28:55,644 --> 00:28:57,128
the military has to give.

566
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:58,816
And if you're goingto come to my house

567
00:28:58,816 --> 00:29:00,675
and accuse him of murder,I need something

568
00:29:00,675 --> 00:29:03,987
more than dreams abouta prisoner of war camp.

569
00:29:03,987 --> 00:29:05,050
There is more.

570
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:08,519
10:00, the night of the murder,

571
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:12,363
someone drove larochefrom his hotel
in a silver sedan.

572
00:29:12,363 --> 00:29:13,816
Garrity drives
a silver sedan.

573
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:19,363
Now, I think I'm going to haveto bring this to scanlon.

574
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,800
And I really thinkyou should distance yourself
from that man before I do.

575
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,441
And you say this all happenedon sunday night?

576
00:29:29,738 --> 00:29:32,737
Senator garrity was with meat 10:00 P.M. On sunday night,

577
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,737
sitting right in this very room,
as a matter of fact.

578
00:29:34,737 --> 00:29:37,488
That was the nighthe came to see me
about running fordistrict attorney.

579
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:39,613
We sat right here,

580
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,441
drinking whiskey and talkinguntil just before midnight.

581
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:46,238
I'm sorry to deflate
your theory, allison,

582
00:29:46,238 --> 00:29:49,191
but the silver sedanyou're referring to was parked

583
00:29:49,191 --> 00:29:50,956
in my drivewaythe entire evening.

584
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,550
ariel:Dad?

585
00:29:57,222 --> 00:29:58,706
Do you know some guynamed mr. Reshmi?

586
00:29:58,706 --> 00:30:00,363
He called when I wason the other line.

587
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,863
Thanks. Hello?

588
00:30:05,363 --> 00:30:05,925
Hello, mr. Dubois.

589
00:30:05,925 --> 00:30:07,987
I... I hope I'm not reaching youat a bad time.

590
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,675
Uh, no, no, I can talk
for a couple minutes.
What's up?

591
00:30:12,347 --> 00:30:14,363
Thieves broke into my apartmentlast night.

592
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:16,050
They came inthrough the back door.

593
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:18,300
I'm afraid they took everything
they could carry.

594
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,925
They even found a ring I had
been saving for my engagement.

595
00:30:22,597 --> 00:30:23,988
I have to know, mr. Dubois:

596
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,738
How exactly did you think
to advise me to buy a lock

597
00:30:25,738 --> 00:30:27,941
on the very day
I was about to be robbed?

598
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,581
Um, well, uh...

599
00:30:34,112 --> 00:30:36,253
it really has nothingto do with me.

600
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:38,253
Uh, like I told you,it's my daughter.

601
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:43,425
Um, she... uh,she worries about people,
and at times, it-it...

602
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,300
seems like she's very...
prescient.

603
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:49,175
Do you know what I mean by that?

604
00:30:49,784 --> 00:30:51,160
I think I can guess.

605
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:53,863
Will you please tell her
I appreciate her effortson my behalf?

606
00:30:54,456 --> 00:30:55,363
I will.

607
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,488
I-I wishI had been more convincing.

608
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,175
And I wish
that I had listened to you.

609
00:31:00,331 --> 00:31:01,050
I also thoughtyou'd like to know

610
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,441
that your family's statuswith the company has changed.

611
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:05,800
Your account was previously
classified as urgent.

612
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,518
Someone was meant
to call your home every day

613
00:31:07,518 --> 00:31:09,113
until we received payment.

614
00:31:09,113 --> 00:31:11,175
Based on the conversations
we had,

615
00:31:11,175 --> 00:31:13,612
I have reclassified your file
as payment pending.

616
00:31:13,612 --> 00:31:16,315
It should be quite some time
before it's reclassified
as urgent.

617
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:17,999
Perhaps 90 days.

618
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:20,925
You're telling me
that nobody's going to call usfor three months?

619
00:31:21,331 --> 00:31:22,722
Thatis right, sir.

620
00:31:23,362 --> 00:31:26,175
Wow. Well, I appreciate that.

621
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,613
Um, are you sureyou're comfortable doing that?

622
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:30,315
It is a large company.

623
00:31:30,362 --> 00:31:31,503
Errors are made.

624
00:31:32,534 --> 00:31:33,675
Good day, mr. Dubois.

625
00:31:41,988 --> 00:31:43,253
uh, bridgettewants to know

626
00:31:43,253 --> 00:31:45,175
if, uh, we can contributea little something

627
00:31:45,175 --> 00:31:47,425
to mr. Reshmi'sengagement ring fund.

628
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,550
I mean, you got tohand it to the girl.

629
00:31:53,488 --> 00:31:54,737
She's reallybuilt a bridge

630
00:31:54,737 --> 00:31:57,815
between the dubois familyand its creditors.

631
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,925
Well, I'm glad one of usis seeing something useful.

632
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,238
You know whatI can't stop thinking about?

633
00:32:03,175 --> 00:32:05,331
Is that poor soldier,michael rhoades.

634
00:32:05,331 --> 00:32:06,300
Just a boy, really.

635
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,113
And he died half a world away.
Al...

636
00:32:09,113 --> 00:32:10,738
it was horrible, and now,

637
00:32:10,738 --> 00:32:13,050
nobody's ever going to knowwhat really happened to him.

638
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,862
Well, maybe that'sa good thing, too.

639
00:32:15,316 --> 00:32:18,675
Even if you could provethat this guy died

640
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:20,487
at the hands of hisfellow prisoners,

641
00:32:20,487 --> 00:32:23,113
what possibly could begained by exposing it?

642
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:26,425
I mean, imagine the horrorhis family would feel

643
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:29,628
if they found outthat this kid was eaten.

644
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,112
And the menwho killed him,

645
00:32:32,112 --> 00:32:33,487
I know that they dida terrible thing,

646
00:32:34,488 --> 00:32:36,999
but they were in akind of living hell.

647
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:40,722
And it doesn't soundlike they went on
to become career criminals.

648
00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:42,613
I know. You're right,of course your right.

649
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,753
this is whatI keep thinking:

650
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:51,612
If I can't tell the truthabout michael rhoades,

651
00:32:51,612 --> 00:32:56,472
and if I can'tp the policesolve la roche's murder,

652
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,237
then why am I seeingthese things?

653
00:32:59,737 --> 00:33:02,999
Why do I have such horriblethings stuck in my head?

654
00:33:04,612 --> 00:33:06,050
Man: I don't think I can do this.

655
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,534
 I'm serious-- I can'T.

656
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:10,113
We've beenover this, evan.

657
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,362
None of us wants to do it.

658
00:33:12,238 --> 00:33:14,112
Gordon's been out of controlfor a long time.

659
00:33:14,112 --> 00:33:15,565
His debts are getting bigger.

660
00:33:15,565 --> 00:33:17,737
He keeps coming to usfor more money.

661
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,456
Now he's threatening to takehis story to the networks.

662
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,999
I know, but you're talkingabout murdering someone.

663
00:33:23,612 --> 00:33:26,050
I haven't held a gun in my handsfor over 30 years.

664
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,550
I'm a doctor now.

665
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,050
We've all built lives forourselves-- that's the point.

666
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,050
If la roche comes outand tells the truth

667
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,738
about what we did to rhoades,that's it-- we're ruined.

668
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,378
I didn't fly out hereto have a debate.

669
00:33:38,988 --> 00:33:39,847
Draw.

670
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,612
Sorry, evan.

671
00:33:51,425 --> 00:33:54,550
Look, I know we needto do this...

672
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,862
correction: Youneed to do this.

673
00:33:56,862 --> 00:33:58,628
Why should I bethe only one at risk?

674
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:03,378
We'll all do it.

675
00:34:04,488 --> 00:34:05,050
Together.

676
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,269
If everybody takes part...then no one can back out later.

677
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,503
No one can becomeanother laroche.

678
00:34:16,238 --> 00:34:18,612
We can't blackmaileach other
or threaten to goto the authorities.

679
00:34:18,612 --> 00:34:20,800
Because we'll allbe murderers.

680
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:24,566
Each one of us will be justas guilty as everybody else.

681
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:28,237
It's the way we should've donethis in the first place.

682
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,987
If we all did rhoades together,

683
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:31,269
then laroche would've hadhis own skin in the game,

684
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:34,175
and we wouldn't be havingthis conversation right now.

685
00:34:37,894 --> 00:34:38,550
Tomorrow night.

686
00:34:39,988 --> 00:34:43,207
Evan, you tell laroche you needto talk to him.

687
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:44,800
He can come to your housefor a drink.

688
00:34:45,737 --> 00:34:47,566
Put some sleeping pillsin his whiskey.

689
00:34:48,862 --> 00:34:50,425
We'll all come over later.

690
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,316
Midnight.

691
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,394
We'll kill him together.

692
00:34:56,988 --> 00:34:58,862
And then each of us will get ridof a piece of him.

693
00:35:00,737 --> 00:35:02,999
Evan, you have to burywhat's left of him.

694
00:35:03,879 --> 00:35:05,112
Do you thinkyou can handle that?

695
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:12,863
Now let me askyou something.

696
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:15,582
Do you own a chainsaw?

697
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:23,425
Scanlon:Evan sabow?

698
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:25,300
Yes?

699
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,175
My name's lee scanlon.

700
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:28,519
I'm with the phoenixpolice department.

701
00:35:29,237 --> 00:35:30,800
I have few questionsfor you about, uh,

702
00:35:31,488 --> 00:35:33,050
about the murderof gordon laroche.

703
00:35:34,862 --> 00:35:35,550
You knew him, right?

704
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,113
Of course.Gordon and I go way back.

705
00:35:39,113 --> 00:35:40,488
We were in the army together.

706
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,425
Did you happen to see himthis past sunday?

707
00:35:43,425 --> 00:35:46,191
Sunday?I don't think so; no.

708
00:35:46,972 --> 00:35:48,925
You sure? Can you rememberwhere you were that night?

709
00:35:49,706 --> 00:35:51,675
I was here.I was home all night.

710
00:35:52,425 --> 00:35:55,816
Are you asking me to accountfor my whereabouts, detective?

711
00:35:56,425 --> 00:35:59,862
Hope you're not implying
I had anything to dowith gordon's death.

712
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,050
Nah, I'm just checking.

713
00:36:02,878 --> 00:36:06,675
Can anybody confirm that youwere here-- wife, kids?

714
00:36:06,675 --> 00:36:08,628
No, I'm divorced.

715
00:36:08,628 --> 00:36:11,999
I was watching televisionall night, by myself.

716
00:36:15,613 --> 00:36:17,425
I like that tattoo.

717
00:36:19,956 --> 00:36:21,753
Gordon laroche hadone just like it.

718
00:36:22,644 --> 00:36:24,893
Yeah, I know.We, uh, we got 'em together.

719
00:36:25,363 --> 00:36:29,050
A group of guys from our unitgot drunk one night

720
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,237
when we were on leave;

721
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,815
we all had thesewhen we woke up.

722
00:36:33,687 --> 00:36:35,472
Wish to god that we hadn'T.

723
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,113
We were justunchof stupid kids.

724
00:36:43,175 --> 00:36:44,144
What's in the bag?

725
00:36:47,925 --> 00:36:52,050
Oh, just some tools, old stuffI was going to get rid of.

726
00:36:52,565 --> 00:36:54,050
You mind openingit up for me?

727
00:36:55,456 --> 00:36:57,238
You don't have to.
We could just waithere together

728
00:36:57,238 --> 00:36:59,488
while somebody drivesover a search warrant.

729
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,425
That's a nice-looking chain saw.

730
00:37:13,425 --> 00:37:16,237
You shouldn't keep your toolsall mixed up like that, though.

731
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:19,550
They're I was going to get rid of them.

732
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:22,519
Hmm...(sniffs)that smells like bleach.

733
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:23,425
No wonder you're lookingto dump that thing.

734
00:37:23,425 --> 00:37:26,050
It's not going to last very longif you use bleach to clean it.

735
00:37:27,675 --> 00:37:30,878
I really don't see that that'sany of your business, detective.

736
00:37:30,878 --> 00:37:31,999
Funny thing aboutchain saws, though.

737
00:37:32,612 --> 00:37:34,800
They're almost impossibleto get completely clean.

738
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,238
There's just too manynooks and crannies.

739
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:40,050
So, dr. Sabow...

740
00:37:40,988 --> 00:37:42,425
if I take a real closelook at that thing, 

741
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:44,956
you think I'll find some ofgordon laroche's blood on it?

742
00:37:50,737 --> 00:37:51,191
hello?

743
00:37:51,363 --> 00:37:54,706
Evan sabow just confessed
to the murder of gordon laroche.

744
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:55,987
Lee, that's great.

745
00:37:55,987 --> 00:37:57,816
Have you arrested garrityand the others?

746
00:37:57,816 --> 00:38:00,925
No. And right now, it doesn't
look like we're going to.

747
00:38:01,675 --> 00:38:02,706
What do you mean?Why not?

748
00:38:03,285 --> 00:38:04,191
Sabow confessed but he'ssaying it was all him.

749
00:38:05,691 --> 00:38:08,191
He says he killed larochewithout any help.

750
00:38:08,363 --> 00:38:09,831
Well, that's not right.

751
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:11,878
Laroche was blackmailingall of them.

752
00:38:11,878 --> 00:38:13,441
All four of them killed him.

753
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:14,769
Not according to sabow.

754
00:38:15,738 --> 00:38:17,175
He says laroche borrowed moneyfrom him,

755
00:38:17,175 --> 00:38:19,050
the two of them had an argumentabout when laroche was

756
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,800
going to pay him backand it turned physical.

757
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,300
He's lying. He's tryingto protect the others.

758
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,050
I believe you,
but we searched his house.

759
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,487
There's no evidence that tiesanyone else to the murder.

760
00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:28,800
None of the neighborssaw anybody

761
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,722
coming or going from the houseon the night laroche died.

762
00:38:31,941 --> 00:38:34,566
We'll keep working it, but, uh,
it looks like sabow's taking

763
00:38:34,566 --> 00:38:35,999
the truth to jail with him.

764
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:36,863
So that's it?

765
00:38:36,863 --> 00:38:38,863
So garrity and the rest of themjust get away with it?

766
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:42,550
I hope not, allison, but at this
point, that's a possibility.

767
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:45,440
Evan sabow may bea bad murderer, but, uh,

768
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,425
I have to admithe's a good soldier.

769
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:50,999
senator garrity?

770
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,284
I'd like to talk to youabout gordon laroche.

771
00:38:53,284 --> 00:38:55,550
I'm afraid I don't have timefor a conversation right now.

772
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,378
Senator...

773
00:38:56,691 --> 00:38:58,925
you really shouldn't be here,mrs. Dubois.

774
00:38:58,925 --> 00:39:01,566
I'm sure you're aware that mannyand I have a press conference

775
00:39:01,566 --> 00:39:02,737
starting in just a few minutes.

776
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:08,675
I would hate for any reportersto see you hanging around.

777
00:39:12,488 --> 00:39:14,050
You don't want to hearabout laroche.

778
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:17,050
Why don't we talk aboutprivate michael rhoades?

779
00:39:21,675 --> 00:39:23,628
Would you all excuse usa moment?

780
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,643
It's been a long time
since anyone mentionedthat name to me.

781
00:39:39,722 --> 00:39:41,487
I know what happenedin that camp.

782
00:39:42,253 --> 00:39:46,425
I know that gordon laroche wasblackmailing
all of you about it.

783
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,999
And you killed him.

784
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:52,363
That's quite a story, especiallysince evan sabow just confessed

785
00:39:52,363 --> 00:39:53,612
to gordon's murder.

786
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,925
From what I'm told, they werehavin argument over money.

787
00:39:56,925 --> 00:39:58,800
But we know better, don't we?

788
00:39:59,268 --> 00:40:01,191
And don't think that youand you're friends are

789
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:02,925
just going to walk awayfrom this.

790
00:40:02,925 --> 00:40:05,362
I am going to find a wayto prove that you did it.

791
00:40:06,331 --> 00:40:07,441
That sounds like a tall order.

792
00:40:08,191 --> 00:40:10,613
The killer's in jail;he freely admits to his crime.

793
00:40:12,222 --> 00:40:14,800
And I must say,I don't understand why a woman

794
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,128
of your obvious talentswould waste her time

795
00:40:18,128 --> 00:40:19,738
on a piece of businesslike this one.

796
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:22,050
The four of you killed someone.

797
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:24,706
Fair enough.

798
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,550
But let me make sureI've got your story right.

799
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:32,378
A long time ago, a soldier died

800
00:40:32,378 --> 00:40:35,999
so that the men he served withcould survive.

801
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,315
My guess is, they were probablyaware of the burden

802
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:43,941
that the death of michaelrhoades placed on them.

803
00:40:44,863 --> 00:40:47,456
Who knows? Maybe they even madeanonymous contributions

804
00:40:47,456 --> 00:40:49,113
to the family ofthat poor, dead soldier.

805
00:40:50,206 --> 00:40:51,737
Seems like the leastthey could do.

806
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:54,863
If these men had anykind of decency at all,

807
00:40:54,863 --> 00:40:56,675
it seems to me that theywould live their lives

808
00:40:56,675 --> 00:41:01,737
in a way that honoredthe sacrifice
that made them possible.

809
00:41:01,737 --> 00:41:03,425
Don't expect me to sympathizewith you.

810
00:41:03,425 --> 00:41:04,987
You gave up your rightto understanding

811
00:41:04,987 --> 00:41:06,675
when you murderedgordon laroche.

812
00:41:07,862 --> 00:41:09,440
Right. Gordon laroche.

813
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,050
He's the sticking point here,isn't he?

814
00:41:12,253 --> 00:41:14,394
If you're right aboutany of this,

815
00:41:14,394 --> 00:41:16,269
he's the only one who made itout of that camp

816
00:41:16,269 --> 00:41:18,425
who didn't understand the legacythat rhoades left behind.

817
00:41:18,425 --> 00:41:22,863
The only one who didn't holdhimself to a higher standard.

818
00:41:23,738 --> 00:41:26,300
If fact it sounds like youthink laroche tried to exploit

819
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,566
that terrible timefor his personal gain,

820
00:41:29,238 --> 00:41:31,175
and he tried to drag the restof those survivors down

821
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:33,925
into the mess he had madefor himself.

822
00:41:35,612 --> 00:41:37,738
Would I be sorry that someonelike that was gone?

823
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,331
Not at all.

824
00:41:39,738 --> 00:41:42,112
He wasn't worthy of the lifeanother man gave him.

825
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,050
Now, if you'll excuse me,allison,

826
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,800
I have to go help put your bossback in office.

827
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,503
A man I happen to believewill do a lot of good.

828
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,488
A man I believe will help you doa lot of good.

829
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,050
And that's all mostof us want, isn't it?

830
00:42:01,612 --> 00:42:04,518
A chance to do something goodwith the time we have.

831
