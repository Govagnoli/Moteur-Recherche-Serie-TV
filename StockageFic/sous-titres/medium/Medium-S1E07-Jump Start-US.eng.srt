1
00:00:00,253 --> 00:00:02,167
Previously on Medium:

2
00:00:02,274 --> 00:00:03,182
Allison Dubois?

3
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:04,094
Yes?

4
00:00:04,154 --> 00:00:05,705
You're ordered to appear and give testimony

5
00:00:05,758 --> 00:00:08,496
in the matter of The State of Arizona v. Nicholas Morgante.

6
00:00:08,651 --> 00:00:12,331
What makes you so special, Mrs. Dubois?

7
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:16,007
What do you really do for the District Attorney?

8
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:18,808
Who are you really, Mrs. Dubois?

9
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:22,873
Well, I'm not Adam Humphries.

10
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:24,957
- What did you just say?
- Adam Humphries.

11
00:00:25,013 --> 00:00:26,820
- He took your Bar exam for you.
- I can't hear them. Can you hear them?

12
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:29,125
...after you cheated but still failed three times.

13
00:00:29,273 --> 00:00:31,680
- Counselor...
- And I'm not Dean Gardner.

14
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,728
You bribed him to keep quiet in your last murder trial.

15
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:36,257
So now you know.

16
00:00:36,887 --> 00:00:39,769
Do you really want to keep asking me who I am?

17
00:00:39,846 --> 00:00:43,296
- Mr. Watt?
- At the risk of everyone finding out who you are?

18
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:58,913
I read the most amazing article in The New Yorker the other night.

19
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:03,035
This social scientist, this researcher

20
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:05,604
went out and did this study where she interviewed everyone

21
00:01:05,672 --> 00:01:09,328
who had ever attempted to kill themselves by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.

22
00:01:10,557 --> 00:01:13,827
And it turns out every single person she interviewed,

23
00:01:14,254 --> 00:01:19,721
every single one confessed that after they threw themselves off that bridge,

24
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,897
about two-thirds of the way down,

25
00:01:22,588 --> 00:01:26,561
it suddenly occurred to them that all the seemingly insurmountable problems

26
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:28,655
they've had in their lives were fixable--

27
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:31,947
every single one.

28
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:37,604
Save for the fact that they had just thrown themselves off the Golden Gate Bridge.

29
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,398
The girl you're looking at has just jumped off a 300-foot cliff.

30
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:45,834
Right now, she's two-thirds of the way down.

31
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:51,496
Ooh, Joe.

32
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:54,619
Hey, Joe?

33
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:57,000
Could you give me a hand, darling?

34
00:01:58,906 --> 00:02:01,132
Hey... a little help here?

35
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:04,173
Thanks a lot.

36
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,633
Honey, I hate to do this to you.

37
00:02:53,704 --> 00:02:57,549
Could you take the girls to school and drop me off at day care on your way to work?

38
00:02:57,632 --> 00:02:59,643
Al, what are you talking about? I don't have a car this morning.

39
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:01,082
It's in the shop, remember?

40
00:03:01,302 --> 00:03:02,833
You were gonna drop me off at work today.

41
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:05,644
Oh, sh...ipwreck!

42
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:09,469
Shipwreck. Okay, guys, hey. Go get your backpacks. Hurry up.

43
00:03:10,185 --> 00:03:12,413
Mommy's running late. Take her and go find her shoe.

44
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:14,850
Come on, Bridg.

45
00:03:15,303 --> 00:03:18,296
For those of us who tuned in late, what's the rush?

46
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,065
I had a dream last night.

47
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:23,391
Of course you did.

48
00:03:23,564 --> 00:03:25,039
In it, a girl committed suicide.

49
00:03:25,116 --> 00:03:27,333
She threw herself off a cliff in the desert.

50
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:29,698
I don't think anybody knows she's there.

51
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:31,441
I think that's why I had the dream.

52
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:32,227
I see.

53
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,846
Actually, I don't.

54
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:37,025
Okay, I want to go to work so I can let law enforcement know

55
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:40,076
so they can launch a search so they can find the body.

56
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,439
So let's me see if I got this right.

57
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:47,260
Some cosmic force is smart enough and all-knowing enough to know

58
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:49,917
that you work for the D.A., so it shows you this dream,

59
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:51,929
knowing that you can do something about it,

60
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:56,152
but this same cosmic force isn't all-knowing enough to know that on this particular morning,

61
00:03:56,335 --> 00:04:00,167
you have to drive your husband to work, 'cause his car needs its 15,000-mile service.

62
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:01,090
Not funny.

63
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,385
I'm not trying to be.

64
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:04,991
What you looking for?

65
00:04:05,237 --> 00:04:07,187
Keys. Girls, have you seen my keys?

66
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:09,722
Keys? I would think even to get a psychic's learner's permit

67
00:04:09,794 --> 00:04:11,636
you'd have to be able to find a lost set of...

68
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,603
Keys?

69
00:04:14,897 --> 00:04:17,791
Girls, Mama's got some keys.

70
00:04:19,455 --> 00:04:21,498
Okay, thanks for the ride.

71
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,530
And don't worry, you know.

72
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:25,772
If my car's not ready, I'll get a ride with someone else.

73
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,417
Don't do that. I'll pick you up.

74
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,390
Hey, there.

75
00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:29,397
Hey, Brett.

76
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:32,255
Carpooling? What are you, a Democrat?

77
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:35,543
Allison, this is Brett. You've heard me talk about Brett, right?

78
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:37,559
- Hey.
- Hi.

79
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:38,803
I've heard a lot about you.

80
00:04:40,182 --> 00:04:41,010
Clear!

81
00:04:44,696 --> 00:04:47,312
We've been working on that wind shear algorithm thing I've been telling you about.

82
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,513
Oh, that thing.

83
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,989
Oh, that thing.

84
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:55,602
I can tell you two have been talking each other's ears off about this.

85
00:04:56,617 --> 00:04:58,849
I'll be upstairs in the Fortress of Solitude.

86
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:01,844
- It was nice to meet you, Allison.
- Nice to meet you, Brett.

87
00:05:03,672 --> 00:05:05,950
- Seems like a nice guy.
- He is a nice guy.

88
00:05:07,793 --> 00:05:08,934
What's with that look?

89
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:12,360
Huh? I don't have a look. I'm lookless. I got to go.

90
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:15,785
Okay, all right. Well, good luck with that, you know, that thing, you know.

91
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:17,485
Thank you.

92
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,185
You're welcome. All part of the service.

93
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:43,506
I didn't mean to frighten you. Didn't realize anyone was here.

94
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:47,310
Oh, it's okay. I was just... I was... Sorry, I'll get out of your way.

95
00:05:52,508 --> 00:05:54,314
Having a seance, Ms. Dubois?

96
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,675
Conjuring a demon, actually.

97
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:00,411
We just need a few minutes.

98
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,198
You got to give it to God.

99
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:12,010
Food, sex-- where'd he come up with this stuff, huh?

100
00:06:12,388 --> 00:06:14,907
Well, for what it's worth, I'm not coming up with anything.

101
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:16,650
We'll get there.

102
00:06:17,637 --> 00:06:18,967
We've only been working on it...

103
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:21,973
seven months.

104
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:24,584
God, we're dumb.

105
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:30,318
Hey, did we ever run that logarithmic vector shift we were playing with last week?

106
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,426
Something I said?

107
00:06:38,423 --> 00:06:39,345
You all right?

108
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:45,504
Whoa!

109
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:47,472
Now I am.

110
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,818
All right, enough fun and games. Back to the coal mine.

111
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:51,996
You know,

112
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:54,557
up to here...

113
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,558
I know. It's pretty damn good, isn't it?

114
00:06:56,646 --> 00:06:58,049
We're not a bad team, Ollie.

115
00:06:58,632 --> 00:07:00,071
Now, if we could only get...

116
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,978
from there to there,

117
00:07:03,894 --> 00:07:04,871
that'd be something.

118
00:07:06,804 --> 00:07:07,987
Maybe we could get published.

119
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:11,775
Get ourselves a little piece of mathematical eternity.

120
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,023
Her parents are on the East Coast.

121
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:57,090
I think her boyfriend's gonna come and identify the body.

122
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:11,682
That's enough.

123
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:19,465
I came as soon as I could.

124
00:09:23,683 --> 00:09:24,891
What are you doing here?

125
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,184
I found the body.

126
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:34,807
Well, I'll just step outside. I'm sure that you and your client would like some privacy.

127
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:38,629
I'd appreciate that, Ms. Dubois, but he's not my client.

128
00:09:39,254 --> 00:09:40,381
He's my son.

129
00:09:50,498 --> 00:09:54,174
It was just weird. The door opens and there he is.

130
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:55,699
You didn't have a clue, huh?

131
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:59,749
Don't tell the other psychics, but no, I didn't have a clue.

132
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:01,255
Here's the funny thing.

133
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:02,641
I felt bad for the guy.

134
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:06,097
I mean, he tried to destroy my life in court last month

135
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:07,808
and I actually felt bad for him.

136
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:09,744
Karma. It comes around.

137
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,739
Well, karma made a girl kill herself

138
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:15,145
so that Larry Watt's son could grieve

139
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:18,724
because his dad was mean to me on a witness stand?

140
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:19,482
I don't think so.

141
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:21,925
Fine. That's the last cosmic theory you get out of me.

142
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,446
From now on, I stick to math.

143
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,908
Brett really liked you.

144
00:10:31,227 --> 00:10:32,129
Really?

145
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:35,461
He said he felt some kind of connection with you.

146
00:10:36,507 --> 00:10:38,799
Hey, he's a single guy. I might have to kill him.

147
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,582
That's not funny.

148
00:10:41,264 --> 00:10:42,209
Okay.

149
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:48,856
Honey,

150
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:53,259
there's something I have to tell you.

151
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:59,203
I'm not sure I really want to know.

152
00:10:59,296 --> 00:11:00,468
Well, it isn't about you.

153
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:02,537
Is it about you?

154
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:03,642
No.

155
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:06,391
It's Brett.

156
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:12,187
The second I met him, the second I touched his hand,

157
00:11:12,996 --> 00:11:16,259
honey, his health is not good.

158
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,359
What are you talking about?

159
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:21,056
His heart.

160
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:23,067
It's not healthy.

161
00:11:23,738 --> 00:11:26,139
It's going to quit on him, and soon.

162
00:11:28,781 --> 00:11:31,326
So what are you saying? You're saying the guy that I work with every day...

163
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:34,449
my friend, is going to die?

164
00:11:36,242 --> 00:11:37,757
I suppose so.

165
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:41,772
You suppose so?

166
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:43,384
This has never happened to me before.

167
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:45,294
I mean, not with somebody we know.

168
00:11:45,883 --> 00:11:49,953
I have been debating with myself all day whether or not to tell you.

169
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,646
Hmm, well, I'm sorry I missed that debate.

170
00:11:51,735 --> 00:11:53,978
Now, what in the hell am I supposed to do with this information?

171
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:55,949
I don't know. Have him go to the doctor.

172
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:56,942
For what?

173
00:11:57,552 --> 00:12:00,603
His anti-premonition vaccine? I mean...

174
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:04,478
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with this.

175
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:10,393
If you're right, then nothing that I can say is going to make a difference,

176
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:15,090
and if you're wrong, then I'm just going to completely freak this guy out,

177
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:17,433
not to mention how do I explain to him...

178
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:21,637
how I know that he's going to die?

179
00:12:22,236 --> 00:12:24,601
You know what? I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.

180
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:26,844
God, or maybe you're right.

181
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:29,977
Why are you angry with me?

182
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,119
Because...

183
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:33,688
I don't know! I just...

184
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:37,498
I liked it so much better when I knew what I knew.

185
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:40,667
When you would say something like this and I just could ignore it.

186
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:43,525
Well, I'm sorry I complicated your life.

187
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:48,332
Hey, wait a second, wait a second. Come back.

188
00:12:48,762 --> 00:12:49,648
Just come back.

189
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,182
So you shook his hand.

190
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:00,677
And I saw it.

191
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:02,560
It was him--

192
00:13:03,452 --> 00:13:05,254
in the back of the ambulance,

193
00:13:05,648 --> 00:13:07,680
wearing the company softball shirt.

194
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,673
Flat-lined. He was gone.

195
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,664
What company softball shirt?

196
00:13:11,746 --> 00:13:12,750
Your company.

197
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:15,888
They have a softball team. They wear shirts and stuff, and...

198
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:18,745
When have you ever heard me talk about a company softball team?

199
00:13:18,996 --> 00:13:21,039
Well, I don't know. I just assumed.

200
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:22,329
Just tell me how this works.

201
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:24,654
If there's no team and then there's no shirt,

202
00:13:24,782 --> 00:13:27,132
then what does that say about the rest of your story?

203
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:33,988
Hallelujah.

204
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,508
The patient lives.

205
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,095
'Night, darling.

206
00:14:26,427 --> 00:14:27,370
Tire tracks?

207
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:29,555
I think that's what she was trying to show me.

208
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:32,070
She came to me in my sleep last night.

209
00:14:32,382 --> 00:14:35,455
She flew out of the ravine and led me to the tire of a car.

210
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:38,624
But why? If this is a suicide, what difference are tire tracks going to make?

211
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,022
I don't know.

212
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:42,059
I just know... what I saw.

213
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:45,511
Medical examiner put the time of death somewhere

214
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:47,834
between noon and 3:00 p.m. on Sunday.

215
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:52,355
Her cellular phone records show that the last call she made was to your house.

216
00:14:52,837 --> 00:14:54,659
Yeah. We spoke.

217
00:14:55,136 --> 00:14:57,752
Must have been around 12:30.

218
00:14:58,473 --> 00:15:00,861
We talked for maybe ten minutes.

219
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:02,703
And was she at the overlook when she called?

220
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:06,226
I didn't know where she was.

221
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:08,924
She didn't say.

222
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:12,631
You told the officers that you were home all day watching TV.

223
00:15:12,697 --> 00:15:14,423
Can anyone verify that?

224
00:15:14,677 --> 00:15:16,517
I had a bunch of friends over.

225
00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:18,079
We were watching the game.

226
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:21,693
I can give you their names.

227
00:15:21,898 --> 00:15:22,681
All right.

228
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:26,148
I think that'll probably end this.

229
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:29,758
We just want to find out what really happened, Greg, you understand?

230
00:15:30,736 --> 00:15:31,744
Me, too.

231
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:36,296
It's just so hard to even imagine Isabel taking her own life.

232
00:15:37,473 --> 00:15:40,525
It's just so not who she is.

233
00:15:45,168 --> 00:15:45,994
What's this?

234
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:48,509
Those are the tire tracks I told you that we found.

235
00:15:49,603 --> 00:15:52,941
Greg, in order to completely eliminate you as a suspect,

236
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:55,210
I'd like your permission to take a look at your tires--

237
00:15:55,296 --> 00:15:58,681
compare the treads, maybe get a soil sample off the rubber.

238
00:15:59,054 --> 00:16:00,197
Absolutely not.

239
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:02,690
Wait a minute. You still think I did this?

240
00:16:02,797 --> 00:16:04,645
We have to rule everybody out.

241
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,802
As soon as we can determine you absolutely weren't there,

242
00:16:06,878 --> 00:16:08,781
we can move on to finding out who was.

243
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:11,292
There is no way on God's green Earth that I'm going to let you

244
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,533
examine my son's car without a search warrant.

245
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,679
Go ahead. Do what you got to do.

246
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,445
Like I said, get a warrant.

247
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:18,187
Larry...

248
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:20,238
You know as well as I do no judge will sign one,

249
00:16:20,298 --> 00:16:23,989
because you have no reason whatsoever to suspect that my son

250
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:27,819
had anything to do with the tragic death of this disturbed young woman.

251
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:29,341
No, we are not doing that.

252
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:31,064
Not here, not today.

253
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:33,323
We're not talking about her that way.

254
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:37,465
I know it's the lawyer in you, but...

255
00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:40,118
No.

256
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,068
I loved her, and she is not...

257
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:49,415
she's not...

258
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,451
was not...

259
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:54,453
disturbed.

260
00:17:00,997 --> 00:17:01,927
I'm sorry.

261
00:17:03,004 --> 00:17:04,330
I apologize.

262
00:17:05,072 --> 00:17:07,975
- But, Greg, as your attorney...
- But you're not just my attorney.

263
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:14,770
And I have nothing to hide.

264
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:46,180
You're back from lunch so soon?

265
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:50,830
Surmising from the look on your face, you didn't get a Happy Meal.

266
00:17:57,922 --> 00:17:58,843
What are you doing?

267
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,130
I'm starting a terrorist cell.

268
00:18:03,563 --> 00:18:04,894
What does it look like I'm doing?

269
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:06,973
I'm organizing a company softball team.

270
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:21,939
What's the deal?

271
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:23,895
You going to ask me out?

272
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:29,440
I don't think it's going to work.

273
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:33,450
Breasts are sort of a non-negotiable item for me. You know?

274
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:38,810
All I'm trying to say is no boobs is a real deal breaker.

275
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,207
I need to tell you something, Brett.

276
00:18:44,596 --> 00:18:46,669
This is something I've never told anyone.

277
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:53,198
It's about me. It's about how I am.

278
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:58,031
I was just kidding about the breasts thing.

279
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:02,542
If you do have them, then feel free to keep them to yourself.

280
00:19:04,636 --> 00:19:05,937
I have this thing...

281
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:09,526
where I can see the future.

282
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:14,220
Nobody knows about it. I've never told anyone.

283
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,393
You're really starting to creep me out, man.

284
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:22,729
And I had this vision...

285
00:19:23,248 --> 00:19:28,398
this dream, and you were in that shirt, and you were dying.

286
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:31,880
You were having a heart attack and you were dying.

287
00:19:35,202 --> 00:19:36,038
Dead.

288
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:43,257
I want you to do something for me. I want you to go to a doctor... right now.

289
00:19:43,435 --> 00:19:45,084
I'll take you. I'll pay for it.

290
00:19:45,386 --> 00:19:46,523
You're kidding, right?

291
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:47,629
Come on, I'll take you right now.

292
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,224
Get your hands off of me.

293
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,169
Come on, think about it for a second. What's the harm?

294
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:55,032
I mean, can you actually go to a doctor too much?

295
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:57,255
- Come on, let me take you.
- No, Joe!

296
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:00,045
And stop looking at me like that.

297
00:20:01,423 --> 00:20:04,514
Don't take this the wrong way, but if there's anyone here who needs to see a doctor,

298
00:20:04,596 --> 00:20:06,434
I seriously suspect it's you.

299
00:20:06,522 --> 00:20:07,522
- Please.
- No.

300
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:10,946
I can see you're serious about this, and...

301
00:20:11,575 --> 00:20:13,618
I love that you're serious about this, but...

302
00:20:14,358 --> 00:20:16,505
I'm not going anyplace but home.

303
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,622
He'll be here any minute. You all right?

304
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:28,804
To be honest, I'm confused.

305
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:30,637
Welcome to the club.

306
00:20:31,283 --> 00:20:33,755
I know that that boy didn't push her off the cliff.

307
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:39,766
Sorry. We had people at the house.

308
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:42,638
Greg is planning a memorial.

309
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,643
Well, I'm sorry to disturb you a second time,

310
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:48,379
but I'm afraid there's been a little glitch in the mix.

311
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,164
Greg, we ran those tests we told you about on the car.

312
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,520
They came back positive.

313
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,373
Your tires matched the tire tracks at the scene.

314
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:56,832
That's not possible.

315
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,811
And forensics found traces of a soil embedded on your car

316
00:20:59,908 --> 00:21:03,749
that matches the soil samples taken from the overlook.

317
00:21:11,631 --> 00:21:12,683
The tests are wrong.

318
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:14,674
- Run another test.
- Larry, you know as well as...

319
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:19,758
Look, for every underpaid forensic expert that you trot out of the State's crime lab,

320
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:23,759
I'll get three expensive credible experts of my own.

321
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,165
Is this a case you really want to try?

322
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,606
Greg... do you understand the implications of what I just told you?

323
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:32,365
You do not have permission to address my son.

324
00:21:32,478 --> 00:21:35,913
Your son is well over the age of majority. Don't need your permission. Sorry.

325
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:36,855
Greg?

326
00:21:39,896 --> 00:21:42,548
But I was home. Isabel called me there.

327
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,995
You know. You said that you had the records.

328
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,837
But that only proves she talked to someone. It doesn't prove she talked to you.

329
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:50,127
I was with my friends.

330
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:51,683
I will give you their names.

331
00:21:51,787 --> 00:21:53,971
And I promise you we will interview each and every one,

332
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:58,611
but that does not change the fact that your car was at that overlook.

333
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,353
I mean, unless you can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt

334
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:04,299
that the car was not in your possession,

335
00:22:04,432 --> 00:22:08,288
that you had loaned it to someone or perhaps it was stolen.

336
00:22:13,903 --> 00:22:15,005
We're done here.

337
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,105
Come on, Greg.

338
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:47,972
Mr. Watt, don't you have something to add here?

339
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:49,571
Did you not hear, young woman?

340
00:22:50,252 --> 00:22:52,068
This interview is over.

341
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:53,564
- Larry, there's...
- Mr. District Attorney,

342
00:22:53,626 --> 00:22:57,951
my son has endured all the questioning that we are prepared to entertain this evening.

343
00:22:58,162 --> 00:23:01,127
Now, if you truly consider him a suspect,

344
00:23:01,217 --> 00:23:03,507
I presume that you have a warrant for his arrest?

345
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,556
Ah. And since you don't, we're leaving.

346
00:23:08,665 --> 00:23:09,297
Greg...

347
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,226
It wasn't your son I was questioning-- it was you.

348
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,310
You know who was in that car. You both do.

349
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,186
Greg.

350
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:19,420
You weren't in that car at all, were you?

351
00:23:21,765 --> 00:23:23,900
Well, he said his battery was dead.

352
00:23:24,017 --> 00:23:24,787
Greg.

353
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:27,757
You told me you were going to the office.

354
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:32,302
- Son...
- Dad?

355
00:23:33,403 --> 00:23:34,719
What's going on?

356
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:51,089
If you give me a moment outside with my son,

357
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,811
I'm prepared to make a statement,

358
00:23:53,893 --> 00:23:56,771
and to tell you what I know about the death of Isabel Galvan.

359
00:24:03,221 --> 00:24:04,984
I met her one night. Uh...

360
00:24:06,934 --> 00:24:10,564
There's a bar near my practice. I stop in there sometimes.

361
00:24:12,756 --> 00:24:14,200
She approached me.

362
00:24:15,158 --> 00:24:17,518
I bought her a drink, we started talking.

363
00:24:19,111 --> 00:24:22,889
At the time, I had no idea that she was involved with my son.

364
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:30,260
We had sex in the back of my car.

365
00:24:36,949 --> 00:24:39,995
A week later, she called me. She told me that...

366
00:24:40,108 --> 00:24:42,134
she knew who I was the whole time,

367
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,459
that she had targeted me,

368
00:24:45,677 --> 00:24:48,145
even recorded our encounter together.

369
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:53,803
She said that unless I gave her $15,000, she would play the tape for Greg.

370
00:24:54,168 --> 00:24:55,846
So when did this happen?

371
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,223
The demand, I mean.

372
00:24:59,251 --> 00:25:00,946
The night before-- Friday.

373
00:25:02,671 --> 00:25:06,112
She very thoughtfully gave me a day to put the money together.

374
00:25:08,262 --> 00:25:12,287
The point is, my son is an innocent in all this.

375
00:25:13,086 --> 00:25:15,819
He doesn't know anything about what this woman was up to,

376
00:25:16,956 --> 00:25:18,855
or my indiscretion with her.

377
00:25:20,064 --> 00:25:21,845
So now it's Saturday.

378
00:25:22,224 --> 00:25:24,897
I agreed to meet Isabel at the overlook.

379
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:29,265
I just wanted her out of my life. I wanted her out of my son's life. I...

380
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:35,183
But when I tried to hand over the cash, she refused to give me the tape.

381
00:25:35,885 --> 00:25:38,087
All of a sudden, she didn't want the money.

382
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:42,316
She said she had changed her mind. She was going to tell Greg everything.

383
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,009
A shakedown? For more money?

384
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,594
So I told her that was all she was going to get out of me.

385
00:25:49,796 --> 00:25:51,046
We argued.

386
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:53,939
She, uh...

387
00:25:55,408 --> 00:25:56,786
She came at me.

388
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,365
I urged her again to take the money, but she refused.

389
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:04,164
When I realized that we weren't getting anywhere, I left.

390
00:26:07,328 --> 00:26:09,601
I swear to you she was still alive.

391
00:26:20,907 --> 00:26:22,539
Hey, you.

392
00:26:25,745 --> 00:26:27,947
I'm sorry I got in so late last night.

393
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:30,394
- You're not gonna believe what happened.
- I really don't want to hear it.

394
00:26:35,022 --> 00:26:36,148
So...

395
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:40,310
So yesterday I told a doctor of mathematics--

396
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:44,944
a man I've worked side by side with since I can't remember when...

397
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:50,126
a man whose intellect I've always respected

398
00:26:51,774 --> 00:26:55,615
and who, I believe, up until yesterday, respected mine--

399
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,941
that I, Joseph Dubois,

400
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,291
can see the future.

401
00:27:06,454 --> 00:27:08,523
And that his days were numbered.

402
00:27:14,452 --> 00:27:16,858
And did you suggest that he see a doctor?

403
00:27:17,232 --> 00:27:18,333
Yes, indeed,

404
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,128
and he urged me to do the same,

405
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:27,518
just before he fled the room with a look of abject terror on his face.

406
00:27:29,474 --> 00:27:30,431
I see.

407
00:27:40,152 --> 00:27:43,083
So initial here, here, here and here.

408
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:44,920
Sorry we're late, gentlemen.

409
00:27:45,095 --> 00:27:48,582
Sorry to make you come to me, Manuel, but I've got trial in 20 minutes.

410
00:27:49,181 --> 00:27:51,997
Hey, somebody apologize to me. I'm the one who's surrendering.

411
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,272
It's merely a formality.

412
00:27:53,426 --> 00:27:56,466
Your son and I both know you're innocent. You're gonna be back home this afternoon.

413
00:27:56,703 --> 00:27:59,098
Nevertheless, we appreciate your cooperation.

414
00:27:59,226 --> 00:28:00,255
Duly noted.

415
00:28:00,723 --> 00:28:02,903
Greg, sign here.

416
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:09,523
Okay, Greg, you've got power of attorney now.

417
00:28:09,794 --> 00:28:13,342
I'm counting on you to take charge of everything until this mess is cleaned up.

418
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,476
But I don't know anything about this stuff, Dad.

419
00:28:16,568 --> 00:28:18,150
It's money. You'll figure it out.

420
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,357
Besides, it's only temporary.

421
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,420
It's not as if they actually have a case.

422
00:28:22,712 --> 00:28:25,242
Let's just let the judge take a look at everything.

423
00:28:25,334 --> 00:28:26,722
And I'll tell you what he'll see.

424
00:28:27,258 --> 00:28:29,779
He'll see a man who exercised bad judgment,

425
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,844
made a horrible mistake and was blackmailed for it.

426
00:28:32,931 --> 00:28:33,510
Larry.

427
00:28:33,634 --> 00:28:37,956
Blackmailed by an unstable woman, who, according to my investigators,

428
00:28:38,031 --> 00:28:41,799
has been prescribed with antidepressants since her preteens,

429
00:28:42,061 --> 00:28:44,180
has a history of suicidal behavior.

430
00:28:44,872 --> 00:28:49,049
She apparently called suicide hotlines the way other people call out for Chinese food.

431
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:56,152
Was that true?

432
00:28:56,771 --> 00:28:58,942
Well, it may be true, but...

433
00:28:59,935 --> 00:29:02,019
that's not the girl that I know.

434
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:04,533
That's not the girl that I loved.

435
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:06,171
Do you think she jumped?

436
00:29:07,405 --> 00:29:09,500
I honestly have no idea.

437
00:29:09,991 --> 00:29:12,960
The only thing I'm certain of at this point is,

438
00:29:13,057 --> 00:29:15,310
I know my father didn't push her.

439
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:17,118
Deputies are waiting outside.

440
00:29:23,415 --> 00:29:26,974
Sorry I'm late. My wife had an emergency at her job and the kids...

441
00:29:52,407 --> 00:29:53,435
Kreskin.

442
00:29:56,993 --> 00:29:58,806
I got to work-- you weren't there.

443
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:01,673
One of the guys said you were here.

444
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:17,990
8:00 last night.

445
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:21,210
I'm cleaning my place...

446
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:26,883
and I have this extraordinary moment of clarity.

447
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:30,508
So I rush back to the lab,

448
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:33,044
and I'm working.

449
00:30:35,994 --> 00:30:37,579
And I feel this...

450
00:30:38,511 --> 00:30:41,926
twinge in my chest,

451
00:30:44,337 --> 00:30:46,663
and I was thinking about what you said,

452
00:30:48,532 --> 00:30:49,607
and so...

453
00:30:54,814 --> 00:30:57,588
I was compelled to call 911.

454
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,660
They told me I was flatlining in the ambulance.

455
00:31:09,647 --> 00:31:11,874
Quadruple bypass.

456
00:31:13,984 --> 00:31:14,971
God.

457
00:31:30,003 --> 00:31:32,707
...where she interviewed everyone who had ever attempted

458
00:31:32,763 --> 00:31:35,718
to kill themselves by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge,

459
00:31:35,984 --> 00:31:38,944
and it turns out every single person she interviewed...

460
00:31:39,126 --> 00:31:40,433
every single one,

461
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,672
confessed that after they threw themselves off that bridge,

462
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:47,350
about two-thirds of the way down,

463
00:31:47,468 --> 00:31:51,570
it suddenly occurred to them that all the seemingly insurmountable problems

464
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:53,110
that they had in their lives

465
00:31:53,433 --> 00:31:54,523
were fixable,

466
00:31:54,903 --> 00:31:56,249
every single one...

467
00:31:57,201 --> 00:32:01,600
save for the fact that they had just thrown themselves off the Golden Gate Bridge.

468
00:32:04,325 --> 00:32:09,253
When we come back, more from Henry Salzman, Director of the Greater Phoenix Suicide Hotline.

469
00:32:12,602 --> 00:32:13,576
Can I help you?

470
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,816
Yes. I work with the District Attorney's office.

471
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:20,778
We're doing an investigation on the death of a young woman named Isabel Galvan.

472
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,194
I was wondering if you could tell me if she ever called the hotline here?

473
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,401
I'm sorry, but all calls to the hotline are confidential.

474
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:28,875
- Yes, I know, but... 
- I'm sorry. I can't help you.

475
00:32:28,977 --> 00:32:31,019
- Sandra, line two.
- Excuse me.

476
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,879
Not the girl I know.

477
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,027
Not the girl I loved.

478
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,279
Bad dream?

479
00:33:13,044 --> 00:33:14,801
No, actually. No dreams.

480
00:33:14,887 --> 00:33:17,827
Just a nagging feeling that something isn't right.

481
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,571
Why are you smiling?

482
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:26,409
This whole Brett thing.

483
00:33:27,724 --> 00:33:30,271
I was just thinking how funny it all was.

484
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:35,983
Here I had myself all in a twist 'cause I thought I was delivering the guy his death sentence,

485
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,731
but as it turned out, I probably,

486
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:41,994
we probably, saved his life.

487
00:33:45,561 --> 00:33:49,070
And I'm sorry I behaved like such an ass yesterday.

488
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:56,437
So what's not right? And what's keeping you awake?

489
00:33:57,506 --> 00:34:00,380
Finding that kid's picture at the suicide hotline?

490
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:02,218
That doesn't prove anything.

491
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:05,756
Yeah, but Watt said that Isabel called hotlines all the time.

492
00:34:05,883 --> 00:34:07,325
There has to be a connection.

493
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:09,796
Okay, well, it all began with that dream you had, right?

494
00:34:09,868 --> 00:34:13,641
So, let's start there and work forward from that.

495
00:34:14,205 --> 00:34:15,796
Well, that's just it.

496
00:34:16,298 --> 00:34:18,152
In my dream, she jumped.

497
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:22,678
There was no foul play. She clearly committed suicide.

498
00:34:23,073 --> 00:34:25,996
Girl walks to the edge of a cliff and jumps.

499
00:34:26,963 --> 00:34:28,054
You're right.

500
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:32,202
Nothing much open to interpretation there.

501
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:34,095
Yeah.

502
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:37,095
Yeah, I know.

503
00:34:38,642 --> 00:34:39,896
I see her--

504
00:34:41,478 --> 00:34:42,671
she's upset.

505
00:34:47,613 --> 00:34:48,857
Wait a second.

506
00:34:50,164 --> 00:34:52,687
And why is it exactly that we're looking for her cell phone?

507
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:55,175
Because that's what she keeps showing to me.

508
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:57,668
At least I think that's what she keeps showing to me.

509
00:34:57,854 --> 00:35:00,249
I got it! I found it!

510
00:35:01,262 --> 00:35:04,611
Me, too. I found it, too.

511
00:35:12,302 --> 00:35:13,342
Gentlemen.

512
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,230
What's going on?

513
00:35:19,716 --> 00:35:22,511
You said I didn't need my attorney. You said you had good news.

514
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:23,837
I believe I do.

515
00:35:24,344 --> 00:35:25,296
Of a sort.

516
00:35:26,537 --> 00:35:29,935
We went back to the scene this morning to retrieve Isabel's cell phone,

517
00:35:30,216 --> 00:35:31,278
which we did,

518
00:35:32,085 --> 00:35:33,146
along with this.

519
00:35:40,913 --> 00:35:42,787
Get off me!

520
00:35:43,104 --> 00:35:45,306
Damn it, I think you drew blood.

521
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:48,440
- That's you.
- Just leave, okay? I'm not taking the money.

522
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,498
I'm telling him everything and you can't stop me.

523
00:35:50,594 --> 00:35:51,532
And that's Isabel.

524
00:35:51,644 --> 00:35:53,636
You're messing with the wrong man, young lady--

525
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:55,490
I'll bury you.

526
00:35:55,746 --> 00:35:57,802
Those words were spoken in the heat of the moment.

527
00:35:57,916 --> 00:35:58,894
I had no intention of...

528
00:36:01,797 --> 00:36:03,358
And that's you driving away.

529
00:36:10,476 --> 00:36:12,381
And that's Isabel dialing the phone.

530
00:36:12,466 --> 00:36:14,422
When you left, Isabel was alive.

531
00:36:14,557 --> 00:36:15,785
I've advised the court.

532
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:17,188
We're dropping all charges.

533
00:36:20,695 --> 00:36:21,770
Thank God.

534
00:36:23,158 --> 00:36:24,156
Thank you.

535
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,389
This is fabulous. The recorder she used to blackmail me proves that I didn't kill her.

536
00:36:30,117 --> 00:36:31,443
Pick up, pick up.

537
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:35,390
She's calling you, Greg. Remember that call?

538
00:36:36,623 --> 00:36:38,436
Can we turn this off now?

539
00:36:38,734 --> 00:36:39,655
Sure thing.

540
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,950
Have a seat. We're not through.

541
00:36:44,923 --> 00:36:48,056
But... what's left to talk about?

542
00:36:48,365 --> 00:36:49,838
Well, there's the truth.

543
00:36:51,262 --> 00:36:52,599
I don't understand.

544
00:36:53,014 --> 00:36:56,013
Did you know that your son volunteered at a suicide hotline?

545
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,631
The same one that Isabel used to call?

546
00:36:58,624 --> 00:37:00,432
Greg has a very giving spirit.

547
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:03,243
Actually, what Greg had was a plan.

548
00:37:03,678 --> 00:37:06,678
And in order for his plan to work, he needed someone.

549
00:37:07,472 --> 00:37:10,037
Someone that he could control and manipulate.

550
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,464
So he volunteered,

551
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:15,506
he started taking calls from the lonely and the desperate,

552
00:37:15,669 --> 00:37:20,045
and finally, one night, he got a call from someone who fit the profile of what he needed.

553
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:21,715
It was Isabel.

554
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:24,071
Greg saved her life that night.

555
00:37:24,165 --> 00:37:26,390
He told her he liked the sound of her voice.

556
00:37:26,498 --> 00:37:28,285
That it was against the rules, but couldn't they meet?

557
00:37:28,382 --> 00:37:30,834
Perhaps we could meet in person.

558
00:37:31,076 --> 00:37:32,258
And she agreed.

559
00:37:32,806 --> 00:37:34,941
Greg made her feel special.

560
00:37:35,638 --> 00:37:39,155
For the first time in her life, she felt loved.

561
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:42,882
And after a few short months, he became her entire world.

562
00:37:43,154 --> 00:37:45,831
So, when he told her to seduce his father...

563
00:37:48,427 --> 00:37:50,824
to record it and use it to blackmail him,

564
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:52,419
she did it.

565
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:57,613
So he had everything set up for the big day.

566
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:00,286
You invited friends over to give you an alibi,

567
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:03,992
you made sure your father's car was out of commission so he'd have to borrow yours.

568
00:38:04,995 --> 00:38:06,752
And just like you told her to,

569
00:38:06,865 --> 00:38:11,251
the dutiful Isabel refused the payoff money and provoked a fight.

570
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:14,237
And then, like a good girl,

571
00:38:14,499 --> 00:38:16,732
she called you to tell you about it.

572
00:38:18,804 --> 00:38:21,533
Greg? Hey, baby, it's me.

573
00:38:22,445 --> 00:38:23,956
Yeah, your dad just left.

574
00:38:24,411 --> 00:38:26,367
Yeah, he went for it.

575
00:38:27,047 --> 00:38:28,778
I taped the whole thing for you.

576
00:38:30,773 --> 00:38:33,135
He was really mad, I thought he was going to kill me.

577
00:38:33,637 --> 00:38:35,573
And that's when you turned on her.

578
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:38,388
You called her a whore.

579
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,926
What-what are you saying? You told me you needed me to...

580
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:44,861
You told her it was a test,

581
00:38:44,998 --> 00:38:47,758
a test to see if she loved you and she failed.

582
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:48,983
Stop!

583
00:38:50,698 --> 00:38:52,286
What are you saying?

584
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:54,650
You knew every button to push.

585
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:57,205
You told her you wished you'd never met her.

586
00:38:57,297 --> 00:39:00,072
You wished you hadn't picked up that call that night at the hotline.

587
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:01,957
You wished she was dead.

588
00:39:02,279 --> 00:39:04,480
Greg, please, don't.

589
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:06,921
I love you.

590
00:39:11,992 --> 00:39:14,694
You knew you could get her to jump.

591
00:39:15,263 --> 00:39:16,717
And you were right.

592
00:39:17,066 --> 00:39:19,835
All the time making it look like your father killed her

593
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:21,597
so you could get Power of Attorney

594
00:39:21,812 --> 00:39:23,389
and control of his money.

595
00:39:27,303 --> 00:39:28,707
I'm truly sorry, Larry.

596
00:39:30,055 --> 00:39:31,048
Dad...

597
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:33,880
They're lying.

598
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,450
Dad, it was all Isabel's idea.

599
00:39:42,518 --> 00:39:44,617
She told me that we could be together and I believed her.

600
00:39:44,724 --> 00:39:45,907
- Dad...
- Young man.

601
00:39:48,795 --> 00:39:50,330
I have a warrant for your arrest.

602
00:39:54,432 --> 00:39:59,147
Yeah? Well, you're gonna have a tough time proving any of it,

603
00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:01,376
and even if you could,

604
00:40:02,035 --> 00:40:03,597
I didn't kill her, so...

605
00:40:03,714 --> 00:40:07,304
the worst you could get me on is conspiracy to blackmail?

606
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,874
Maybe you're right.

607
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:15,020
But even so, I'm going to tie up your life and make it a living hell.

608
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:16,770
You're going to spend so much time in court,

609
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,310
the bailiffs are going to want to make you shop steward,

610
00:40:19,843 --> 00:40:22,336
and by the time I'm done with you, trust me,

611
00:40:22,701 --> 00:40:25,454
you're going to wish you threw yourself off a cliff.

612
00:40:40,067 --> 00:40:40,779
Hey.

613
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:42,048
Hey.

614
00:40:43,985 --> 00:40:45,176
Kids are asleep.

615
00:40:45,996 --> 00:40:47,476
If they weren't...

616
00:40:48,755 --> 00:40:49,959
heads would roll.

617
00:41:00,895 --> 00:41:02,191
Are you all right?

618
00:41:05,555 --> 00:41:07,003
Piece of plaque.

619
00:41:08,053 --> 00:41:09,681
Size of a tiny crumb.

620
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:12,745
In his blood.

621
00:41:14,355 --> 00:41:15,175
Went to his heart.

622
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,099
I realized later on that you knew.

623
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:24,074
This morning... in bed, you knew.

624
00:41:27,024 --> 00:41:29,205
That's why you didn't say anything when I was going on and on

625
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:31,295
about how well things worked out.

626
00:41:32,312 --> 00:41:33,296
I just...

627
00:41:33,412 --> 00:41:34,703
I didn't know where.

628
00:41:35,523 --> 00:41:36,848
I didn't know when.

629
00:41:37,883 --> 00:41:38,862
I just...

630
00:41:40,572 --> 00:41:43,050
I didn't want to do it to you twice,

631
00:41:44,729 --> 00:41:45,938
that's all.

632
00:42:22,278 --> 00:42:25,840
If we could only get from there to there...

633
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:29,134
That would be something, hmm?

634
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,912
Son of a bitch.

635
00:42:34,731 --> 00:42:36,210
Think they'll publish it?

636
00:42:39,509 --> 00:42:40,495
I hope so.

637
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:44,167
Maybe he'll get his little piece of eternity after all.

638
00:42:52,681 --> 00:42:56,419
