1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Previously on medium

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,900
I'm just a girl who wants to be a lawyer.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,900
Wants to do her job,
be a good wife, a good mother.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,800
Be like everybody else.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,500
But you're not like everybody
else and you know that.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,400
Even among the special, you're special.

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,700
Who might this be?
Looks familiar.

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,800
He and his friend raped a young girl.

9
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,700
Sliced her open.
Took her apart.

10
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:22,300
Dr. Charles -The Butcher- Walker of Wichita.

11
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:24,601
Wanted dead or alive
for the maniacal evisceration

12
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,604
of 3 unmarried daughters
from the Great Plains.

13
00:00:26,706 --> 00:00:28,607
Seems like every 15 years or so,

14
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:30,900
someone hears a voice
and a young girl dies.

15
00:00:33,406 --> 00:00:34,401
Ladies.

16
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:37,102
If you'd kindly take a seat
in the waiting room,

17
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:40,400
the doctor and I will finish up
and be with you shortly.

18
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:51,603
I know it hurts, Maura
but we're almost there.

19
00:00:52,507 --> 00:00:53,801
I'm sure of it.

20
00:00:54,607 --> 00:00:56,501
Our baby is a stubborn one.

21
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:58,301
Isn't he, Charles?

22
00:00:58,707 --> 00:01:00,901
Takes after his blessed Mother, I suppose.

23
00:01:03,307 --> 00:01:04,901
A word, Mr. Walker.

24
00:01:11,508 --> 00:01:13,702
She's been in labor
for over 30 hours now.

25
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:15,802
Something clearly is not right.

26
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:20,501
Just how old is your wife, Mr. Walker?

27
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:28,503
I think it's time we considered
an alternate method of delivery.

28
00:01:28,508 --> 00:01:29,900
You intend to cut her?

29
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:33,201
Mr. Walker, I'm seeing an
unusual amount of blood.

30
00:01:33,805 --> 00:01:36,101
I fear it may already be
too late for Mrs. Walker,

31
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:38,301
but there's still a chance
I can save the baby.

32
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:39,402
Doctor,

33
00:01:39,406 --> 00:01:41,901
I don't re about the baby.

34
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:44,503
Honestly, all I care about is Maura.

35
00:01:44,707 --> 00:01:46,402
It's all right, Charles.

36
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:49,401
The only thing that matters
is our child.

37
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't agree.
I don't agree with any of this.

38
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:53,600
You're going to be fine.

39
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:57,503
- We just need a little more time.
- With all due respect,

40
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,802
you're not a doctor, you don't
know the first thing about medicine.

41
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,202
There... There is no time.

42
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:06,901
Maura!

43
00:02:07,105 --> 00:02:08,701
It's all right,
Charles.

44
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:10,702
Let him do...

45
00:02:10,806 --> 00:02:12,403
what he has to do.

46
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:14,102
Maura!

47
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,801
Doctor, open the door!

48
00:02:19,608 --> 00:02:21,202
Maura, I'm here.

49
00:02:24,107 --> 00:02:25,103
Maura?

50
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:28,901
No!

51
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:40,003
It's a boy.

52
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:50,601
Sir, your child needs you.

53
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,002
<i>Sir, have you gone mad?</i>

54
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:58,601
<i>Your place is out here
with this child, not...</i>

55
00:02:58,608 --> 00:03:00,501
<i>not in there with a dead woman!</i>

56
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:16,900
<i>Sir, what are you doing in there?</i>

57
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,203
<i>I'm going to the police, Mr. Walker.</i>

58
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,502
<i>If you do not unlock this door and
come out here and be with this baby,</i>

59
00:03:29,606 --> 00:03:31,603
<i>I'll be forced to go to the police!</i>

60
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:39,200
Mommy?

61
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:41,200
You okay?

62
00:03:44,106 --> 00:03:45,800
Hi, Sugarbear.

63
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:48,800
Yeah, I'm okay.

64
00:03:49,908 --> 00:03:51,300
Just had a nightmare.

65
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:52,603
Just a...

66
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:55,300
a silly little nightmare.

67
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:57,701
Was it scary?

68
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,003
It was scary.

69
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,703
And sad.

70
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:05,900
Don't worry, Mommy.
It was just a dream.

71
00:04:06,106 --> 00:04:08,201
You probably won't even
remember it by morning.

72
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:11,800
Thanks, Bridge.

73
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:19,501
Think about ice cream.

74
00:04:19,705 --> 00:04:21,503
Or cake. That's what I do.

75
00:04:22,706 --> 00:04:24,502
Chocolate works really good.

76
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,702
- Got it.
- Candy, too.

77
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:29,101
Or cereal if it's close to morning.

78
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,303
Cookies are really good, too.

79
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:41,201
Mommy?

80
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:42,902
I'm hungry.

81
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:46,903
Never mind.

82
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:36,803
Hi. I don't know if you remember me.

83
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:39,401
Allison Dubois.
Of course I remember you.

84
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:41,700
So you still dream, huh?

85
00:05:42,406 --> 00:05:43,801
That's a good thing,
I suppose.

86
00:05:44,306 --> 00:05:46,801
Better than being like me.
I just don't sleep.

87
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:48,303
Afraid to, I guess.

88
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:50,100
Afraid of what I'll see.

89
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:52,103
There must be a reason

90
00:05:52,207 --> 00:05:54,501
I had a dream about
Walker and his wife, right?

91
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:57,401
I just don't know how
to make sense of what I saw.

92
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:59,501
In that case, what do you feel?

93
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:01,702
Feel?

94
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:05,801
What you see can sometimes fool you,
but what you feel rarely lets you down.

95
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:07,003
Well,

96
00:06:07,006 --> 00:06:09,103
I felt the same way I always feel

97
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:10,801
when I see him in my dreams.

98
00:06:11,006 --> 00:06:13,602
That some girl is poised to die soon.

99
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,701
That  he's up to his old tricks.

100
00:06:15,806 --> 00:06:18,302
That he's found someone
in the here and now to do his bidding,

101
00:06:18,305 --> 00:06:20,201
and it's just a matter of time. 

102
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:21,801
See that?
You don't even need me.

103
00:06:21,808 --> 00:06:23,400
Then why did I see a moment

104
00:06:23,408 --> 00:06:25,402
from Walker's past,
and not his present?

105
00:06:25,607 --> 00:06:28,603
Why didn't I see the face
of the man he's whispering to?

106
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:31,103
Or a clue as to who
his next victim's gonna be?

107
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:33,901
Maybe you don't need
to see those things to stop him.

108
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:37,300
God doesn't play dice with the universe,

109
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:40,603
and people like us don't see the
things we do without a reason.

110
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:42,501
I know it's not easy but--

111
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:45,802
You  have to have faith that the reason
will make itself known to you,

112
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,303
either in your dreams
or your waking life.

113
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,802
Oh, my poor kids.
I'm a terrible cook.

114
00:06:56,106 --> 00:06:57,702
It smells delicious.

115
00:06:58,007 --> 00:07:00,202
but I couldn't resist.

116
00:07:00,307 --> 00:07:01,800
but  I couldn't resist.

117
00:07:01,905 --> 00:07:04,501
Grocery store up the street
was having a sale.

118
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:06,703
I've got some extra coupons
if you'r interested.

119
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:19,901
<i>Nothing like slicing a ripe one
right down the middle.</i>

120
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:23,902
Sorry, did you say something?

121
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:26,900
I said the ripe ones
are usually in the middle.

122
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:40,403
Move your ass, Amanda.

123
00:07:40,706 --> 00:07:42,303
/*Stacey's got a table for us*/ out front,

124
00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:44,101
and I've got a quiz fifth period.

125
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:48,902
<i>I damn near got a speeding ticket,</i>

126
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:51,102
but I made it.
Now I don't see you.

127
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:53,702
Thanks for hurrying over.
Five cars ahead on your left.

128
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,402
I'm in the Volvo.

129
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:06,602
- So where's the girl?
- She's over there.

130
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:08,801
She's got the green
school jacket on.

131
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:11,602
Thought you said
this girl was in danger.

132
00:08:11,706 --> 00:08:12,702
She is.

133
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,402
She just doesn't know it yet.

134
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:16,402
Do you remember that doctor?

135
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:18,102
The one who has a thing
for teenage girls?

136
00:08:18,105 --> 00:08:19,501
The one from the 1800s?

137
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:21,503
Your friend the "ghost guy"?

138
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:23,601
Don't do that. You were there.

139
00:08:23,908 --> 00:08:25,903
I was there Allison,
and I remember a butcher.

140
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,103
And I remember the girl
he was determined to cut up.

141
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,801
But do I remember Walker?

142
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:31,802
I can't say I ever really
laid eyes on the guy,

143
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:34,300
but I'll take your word for it,
so... point him out to me.

144
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:36,601
Or point out the person
you think he's working through.

145
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:37,704
I can't.

146
00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:39,807
I haven't got a good look at him yet.

147
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:41,602
I had a dream.

148
00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:44,502
And I heard Walker's voice
when I was in the store.

149
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:46,002
He was talking
about her.

150
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:48,501
So we don't even really know
who we're looking for here?

151
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:51,502
We don't even know what sack of skin
this ghost might have crawled into.

152
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:53,602
Assuming he's the one
who's really behind this.

153
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:55,803
Assuming there's a "this"
he's really behind.

154
00:08:55,906 --> 00:08:58,900
Forget about that. Forget about
who he might be working through.

155
00:08:58,908 --> 00:09:00,503
It doesn't matter.

156
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,902
As long as we don't let
this girl out of our sight,

157
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:04,202
thing can happen, right?

158
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:06,803
Allison, you're talking about
round-the-clock surveillance.

159
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:08,703
Multiple guys working multiple shifts.

160
00:09:08,905 --> 00:09:12,202
and all for a girl, who by the way,
may not even be in any real danger.

161
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:16,900
All right.

162
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,601
I know a couple of guys
who owe me a few favors.

163
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,403
I'll see what I can cobble together.

164
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:23,703
<i>I know you guys said
we could only watch</i>

165
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,501
ten hours of television a week,

166
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:26,802
but Mr. Gressler said

167
00:09:26,805 --> 00:09:30,002
that part of studying current events
is keeping up with the news every night.

168
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,003
You could always try reading the paper.

169
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,203
But the paper's,
like, 60 pages long.

170
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:38,100
And the good thing about TV news
is that it's only a half hour.

171
00:09:39,906 --> 00:09:42,100
Well, I suppose, if it's for school.

172
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:44,603
So I can watch
12 1/2 hours a week?

173
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:46,702
Suddenly she's good at math.

174
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:47,601
No.

175
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:49,901
You can watch ten hours of television,

176
00:09:50,008 --> 00:09:52,003
and two and a half hours
of news a week.

177
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:59,200
That was a scrumptious dinner, darling.

178
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:01,303
You really should've tried some.

179
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:06,800
I just keep waiting
for the phone to ring.

180
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,101
I just...

181
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,401
keep wishing I'd seen something useful

182
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:13,200
like the face of the man
he's gonna use to get to her.

183
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:18,903
A doctor in Bisbee.

184
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:20,900
Will wonders never cease?

185
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:22,901
Dr. Charles Walker.

186
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,000
Pleased to make your
acquaintance Ma'am.

187
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:25,901
Oh, my!

188
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:28,102
Listen to that accent.

189
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:29,702
You sound fancy.

190
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:32,802
Surprised you'd settle
in a place like this.

191
00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:36,503
Bisbee's kind of out of the way
to have a doctor.

192
00:10:37,205 --> 00:10:38,703
I rather like "out of the way."

193
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:40,302
And "out of the way" is...

194
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:43,300
where people tend to need a doctor most.
Don't you think?

195
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:47,301
You know, my daughter

196
00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:49,200
had some pain of late.

197
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,403
Your daughter?

198
00:10:51,707 --> 00:10:53,202
She's at that age.

199
00:10:53,406 --> 00:10:56,001
Everything's changing,
everything's... hurting.

200
00:10:56,207 --> 00:10:58,101
We got some pills
through the mail, but...

201
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:01,000
Would you like me to have a look?

202
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:04,603
Your mother says that you experience

203
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,403
pain from time to time.

204
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:10,003
Yes, sir.

205
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:12,402
You ever heard of the expression,

206
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:14,703
"growing pains"?

207
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,200
Yes, sir.

208
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:24,300
Would you like me to make them go away?

209
00:11:25,707 --> 00:11:27,900
- Go away forever?
- Yes, sir.

210
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:30,400
I think I can make that happen.

211
00:11:30,807 --> 00:11:32,603
I think I can do that right now,

212
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:35,203
with one very simple procedure.

213
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:36,900
Would you like that?

214
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:38,701
Yes, sir.

215
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,900
Will it hurt, doctor?

216
00:11:44,008 --> 00:11:45,501
Only at first.

217
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:47,701
But then you'll feel nothing.

218
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:51,902
For the rest of your life,

219
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:54,002
you'll feel nothing.

220
00:12:16,205 --> 00:12:17,403
Amanda?

221
00:12:18,408 --> 00:12:19,901
Are you talking to me?

222
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,103
My name's Allison Dubois,
I'm with the city of Phoenix.

223
00:12:22,105 --> 00:12:24,100
I work for the District Attorney's Office.

224
00:12:24,105 --> 00:12:27,001
Am I in some kind of trouble?
Is this about the car accident?

225
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:28,703
I don't know anything
about an accident.

226
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,803
- But there is a man...
- <i>Amanda!</i>

227
00:12:34,806 --> 00:12:36,300
Can you hear him?

228
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,003
You can see him!

229
00:12:38,705 --> 00:12:41,203
People actually eat
at this hour in the sun?

230
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:43,401
Stay where you are!

231
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,700
- Who's this? A friend of your mom's?
- I don't know, she just showed up.

232
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,403
Don't you come near her.

233
00:12:48,505 --> 00:12:50,600
And  stop talking.
We can see you.

234
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:53,000
Police! I need your help.

235
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,001
He's gonna hurt this girl!

236
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,500
Miss, I think you have me
confused with someone else.

237
00:12:57,607 --> 00:12:59,503
Put her in protective custody!

238
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:02,601
I know you can't see the man
who's threatening her, but...

239
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:04,803
Hands in the air!
And body on the ground now!

240
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:07,801
- He's my friend.
- What the hell is going on?

241
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:10,302
What's wrong with you people?

242
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:12,003
You okay, Ma'am?

243
00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:18,300
Actually...

244
00:13:18,705 --> 00:13:21,101
I can't help but kind of wish
he was a ghost.

245
00:13:21,307 --> 00:13:22,400
Excuse me?

246
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:25,603
Ghosts, for the most part,
have very limited legal rights.

247
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:28,501
Extremely rare that you hear about one
suing a city or county government

248
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:30,003
for false arrest.

249
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:37,003
You were half right.
The guy's name is Walker.

250
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:39,701
Only it's Jack, not Charles.

251
00:13:40,405 --> 00:13:42,700
Who knows, maybe he's
the son of the son of the son.

252
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:44,302
I dreamt...

253
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,902
about the birth of his
great-grandfather the other night.

254
00:13:47,205 --> 00:13:49,003
Anyway, this Walker's 36, unmarried,

255
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:51,601
owns some kind of computer
repair store on the west side.

256
00:13:51,906 --> 00:13:54,403
A DUI 18 months ago,
other than that, he's clean.

257
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:56,602
Maybe it's my imagination,
but I do sense

258
00:13:56,608 --> 00:13:59,502
our boy jonesing for a drink.
Not that that's against the law.

259
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,003
And how do these two
know each other?

260
00:14:03,205 --> 00:14:05,702
She t-boned him at an intersection
a couple months ago.

261
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:07,801
Whole left side of his car got crushed.

262
00:14:08,005 --> 00:14:09,301
Any record of this?

263
00:14:09,605 --> 00:14:11,102
Walker wanted to call an ambulance,

264
00:14:11,207 --> 00:14:14,003
but she didn't want her parents
finding out she'd been in an accident.

265
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:16,303
He agreed not to call the cops
or the insurance company

266
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:18,700
if she let him take her
to a doctor he knew.

267
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:25,202
<i>She's en paying
for the car repairs and the...</i>

268
00:14:25,305 --> 00:14:26,503
...doctor visit ever since.

269
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:29,903
In fact, according to him, that's what
he was doing at the grocery store today.

270
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:32,302
Picking up the latest installment.

271
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,200
Everything I saw when I looked at her.

272
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,200
It wasn't a premonition, it already happed.

273
00:14:39,908 --> 00:14:42,002
I thought I saw Charles Walker
trying to hurt her.

274
00:14:42,008 --> 00:14:44,500
It was really that man
trying to help her.

275
00:14:45,906 --> 00:14:46,802
Hello. 

276
00:14:46,907 --> 00:14:48,402
In here.

277
00:14:56,206 --> 00:14:58,402
Okay, what have you
done with my children?

278
00:14:58,705 --> 00:15:00,302
Take a look at the clock, honey.

279
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:02,201
Marie is already asleep

280
00:15:02,605 --> 00:15:04,801
and Ariel's helping Bridgette
with her homework.

281
00:15:04,908 --> 00:15:07,003
I left some dinner
for you in the fridge.

282
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:09,500
Oh, good.

283
00:15:09,705 --> 00:15:12,702
I was afraid I was going to have
to keep after you to eat something

284
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,500
from  the alcohol food group.

285
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:16,500
Back off.

286
00:15:16,806 --> 00:15:18,600
I had an innocent man arrested today

287
00:15:18,608 --> 00:15:20,803
because I thought he was a ghost.

288
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:26,602
Maybe you should grab me
one of those, too.

289
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:34,101
You know what the weirdest part was?

290
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:36,803
How nice he was.

291
00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:39,903
How reasonable he was
about the whole thing.

292
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,603
He kept reassuring Devalos,
said he wasn't going to sue the city.

293
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:46,702
He kept telling me to keep my chin up,

294
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:48,602
that everybody makes mistakes.

295
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:51,602
He even told Scanlon he hoped
there were
no hard feelings.

296
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:53,702
Okay. That's nice.

297
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,502
But if this Amanda girl
was never in any real danger,

298
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:01,100
why do you keep having dreams...

299
00:16:01,408 --> 00:16:03,203
about his great-great uncle.

300
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:05,200
Or his not so great-great...

301
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:06,302
...grandfather?

302
00:16:06,805 --> 00:16:09,601
Or whoever this guy Charles is to him?

303
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:13,103
Don't know. And...

304
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:16,901
I don't care.

305
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:18,701
The girl's safe.

306
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:20,802
Nobody's suing the city.

307
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:22,700
Mama's finally home.

308
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:26,202
I say <i>all's</i> right with the world.

309
00:16:27,307 --> 00:16:28,900
All is right with the world.

310
00:16:35,805 --> 00:16:37,400
Beloved Maura...

311
00:16:38,406 --> 00:16:40,700
we bring you gifts from life into death.

312
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:43,503
We ask that you commune with us,

313
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:45,402
and move among us.

314
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:47,902
Join us, Maura,

315
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:52,100
so that your husband
may know your presence once more.

316
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:56,700
What?

317
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:01,301
She's been watching you.

318
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:03,202
She's seen it all.

319
00:17:03,907 --> 00:17:06,203
Seen the terrible things you've done.

320
00:17:09,107 --> 00:17:10,802
She wants to know why.

321
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:14,103
Why would you hurt those girls?

322
00:17:15,908 --> 00:17:17,503
She doesn't understand.

323
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:24,400
It still hurts to be without her.

324
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:27,700
It's the only thing
that makes the pain go away.

325
00:17:28,406 --> 00:17:29,503
Tell her.

326
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:34,400
- She's gone.
- Get her back.

327
00:17:34,706 --> 00:17:35,800
I can't.

328
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:38,203
I said get her back! Now!

329
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:40,103
Charles,

330
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:41,903
Charles you're hurting me.

331
00:17:46,408 --> 00:17:47,701
I'm sorry, Mother.

332
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,101
So his mother has the gift.

333
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,301
Prably watched her
talk to ghosts his whole life.

334
00:17:59,005 --> 00:18:00,803
I wonder if that's when
he first figured out

335
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:03,201
that the dead can
communicate with the living.

336
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:05,602
So let me ask you a question.

337
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:08,502
Charles's mother had a gift.
She was sensitive.

338
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:11,103
What are the chances
another relative could be?

339
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:14,100
You know better than I do
that it runs in families.

340
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:16,602
It can span generations.

341
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:18,501
So if Jack were sensitive,

342
00:18:18,606 --> 00:18:21,402
Charles could, theoretically,
be whispering in his ear,

343
00:18:21,606 --> 00:18:23,602
pointing him in the direction
of his next victim.

344
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:25,903
So how do I find out

345
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:28,703
if the young Walker
has the old Walker in his head?

346
00:18:31,406 --> 00:18:33,000
Why don't you ask him?

347
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:57,202
I'm not about to get tackled, am I?

348
00:18:57,606 --> 00:18:59,802
I wanted to apologize again.

349
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,100
I couldn't sleep last night, I felt so...

350
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:04,803
Unnecessary yesterday,
unnecessary today.

351
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,200
And also...

352
00:19:08,406 --> 00:19:10,901
since I was in the area,
I was wondering if I could...

353
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:12,703
talk to you about something.

354
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:15,401
I-I'm on a little bit of a schedule,

355
00:19:15,606 --> 00:19:16,903
actually. Uh...

356
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:21,003
Well, the main thing...

357
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:23,801
is...

358
00:19:26,606 --> 00:19:28,003
Are we alone?

359
00:19:30,907 --> 00:19:31,903
Yeah. 

360
00:19:32,106 --> 00:19:33,500
No, I mean...

361
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,403
Am I...

362
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:39,901
the only person you are
listening to right now?

363
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:45,500
Sorry, I'm...

364
00:19:45,906 --> 00:19:47,303
taking medication.

365
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:48,602
on schedule.

366
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:51,402
I'll be right back.

367
00:19:52,105 --> 00:19:54,101
No  problem. Go right ahead.

368
00:20:18,408 --> 00:20:19,501
She's a bit...

369
00:20:21,406 --> 00:20:23,902
...obsessed with me, actually.

370
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:27,602
Honestly, I-I'm not at all interested.

371
00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:28,902
I...

372
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,401
just want the money
she owes me for the car

373
00:20:31,505 --> 00:20:32,903
and the doctor.

374
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,302
I believe you.

375
00:20:34,406 --> 00:20:36,202
I know you're not interested.

376
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:40,801
Which is why I was asking.
Are we alone?

377
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:42,803
I'm sorry, I'm...

378
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:44,503
You hear him,don't you?

379
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,901
In your head.
Telling you to hurt her.

380
00:20:47,506 --> 00:20:49,402
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

381
00:20:49,505 --> 00:20:52,701
Sure you do!
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

382
00:20:52,905 --> 00:20:55,601
You are fighting it
with everynch of your being.

383
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:59,401
You are fighting it with the alcohol
you just drank in the bathroom.

384
00:21:00,107 --> 00:21:02,800
What do you do?
Do you time each dose?

385
00:21:03,505 --> 00:21:05,701
Just enough to keep
the voice of the devil away,

386
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:08,801
but not enough to make it
impossible to live?

387
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:10,201
To work?

388
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:15,903
Okay.

389
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:20,901
This is for you, not him.

390
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,602
not him.

391
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:24,902
He already knows me.

392
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:34,303
<i>Burn! Burn him out!</i>

393
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:36,603
You would not believe
the size of the crowd

394
00:21:36,707 --> 00:21:38,501
we got outside tonight.

395
00:21:40,108 --> 00:21:41,703
They're all here for you.

396
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:47,002
I don't think I've ever felt so loved.

397
00:21:47,505 --> 00:21:50,501
I'm glad to see you still got
your sense of humor, Doc.

398
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:52,702
I was afraid we'd beaten it out of you

399
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,802
when we tracked you down the other night.

400
00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:57,301
It's a show these simpletons are waiting for.

401
00:21:57,807 --> 00:22:00,503
You can remind them, I don't
hang for another three days.

402
00:22:01,806 --> 00:22:04,001
I don't think they intend to wait that long.

403
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:06,202
Truth be told,

404
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:09,302
when I think about what
you did to all those girls,

405
00:22:09,905 --> 00:22:11,702
I'm tempted to let 'em in here.

406
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:14,802
Save us the cost
of building a gallows.

407
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:20,201
- That you, Deputy?
- Yes, sir.

408
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,100
Prisoner's got a visitor.

409
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:23,601
Says she's his mother.

410
00:22:34,307 --> 00:22:35,603
Oh, my poor boy.

411
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:36,700
<i>Get him out!</i>

412
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,300
What have they done to you?

413
00:22:38,506 --> 00:22:40,600
Probably no more than I deserve, Mother.

414
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:45,202
Sorry, Sheriff.

415
00:22:45,307 --> 00:22:46,900
They come up behind me.

416
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:49,102
It's all right, Mother.
I'm not afraid.

417
00:22:49,408 --> 00:22:51,301
I'm finally going to be with Maura.

418
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:53,303
No, you're not.

419
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:55,303
You don't understand, do you?

420
00:22:55,505 --> 00:22:58,303
You're never going to be with her,
not after the things you've done.

421
00:22:58,307 --> 00:23:01,900
- You're wrong, she'll forgive me.
- It doesn't matter, Charles.

422
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:04,001
You're not going to where she is.

423
00:23:05,406 --> 00:23:06,602
Then I'm not going.

424
00:23:07,007 --> 00:23:08,402
Say your prayers, Walker.

425
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:11,501
Do you hear me, Mother?
Do you understand?

426
00:23:11,707 --> 00:23:14,500
I-WILL-NOT-DIE!

427
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,502
Allison we've already
mistakenly arrested this man once.

428
00:23:22,507 --> 00:23:23,901
I don't think you understand

429
00:23:23,908 --> 00:23:26,000
how determined the forces
that are driving him are.

430
00:23:26,008 --> 00:23:28,700
These forces you keep talking about
are not something I control

431
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,200
frankly, they're not even something
I necessarily believe in.

432
00:23:31,207 --> 00:23:33,501
I know you think
I have a very powerful job,

433
00:23:33,505 --> 00:23:37,600
but influencing the behavior of the
dead falls decidedly outside my purview.

434
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:51,603
The first time I heard the voice, I was 15.

435
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,600
I was at the movies with Torie Keeler.

436
00:23:54,806 --> 00:23:56,902
It started rhapsodizing about...

437
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:59,603
the shape and the size of her bosom.

438
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:03,100
I wasn't terribly concerned
at first, because...

439
00:24:03,705 --> 00:24:04,802
frankly,

440
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:08,400
I'd given a fair amount of thought to
the shape and size of her bosom myself.

441
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:11,801
A week later...

442
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:14,002
it started whispering to me about

443
00:24:14,206 --> 00:24:16,003
how divine it would be...

444
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:19,401
to see a drop of her menstrual blood,

445
00:24:20,606 --> 00:24:22,001
work its way

446
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:24,202
down her pale, white thigh.

447
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,702
Since I'd never seen
menstrual blood

448
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:33,301
and only had the vaguest understanding
of what it was or when it might appear,

449
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,500
I came to the rapid conclusion
that I was mentally ill.

450
00:24:38,806 --> 00:24:40,102
The second I was alone,

451
00:24:40,307 --> 00:24:42,103
I smoked a copious amount of marijuana

452
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,203
and discovered the damndest thing.

453
00:24:46,405 --> 00:24:48,203
I got very hungry, and...

454
00:24:48,406 --> 00:24:50,501
I couldn't hear the voice anymore.

455
00:24:52,505 --> 00:24:54,300
With age comes wisdom.

456
00:24:54,707 --> 00:24:56,700
And I soon discovered that alcohol

457
00:24:57,005 --> 00:24:58,502
worked better than grass.

458
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:01,501
And by medicating myself with
tiny amounts throughout the day,

459
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,400
I could pretty much eliminate
the dissertations in my head about...

460
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:08,002
nipple transplants and...

461
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:09,903
how beautifully

462
00:25:10,105 --> 00:25:12,003
the skin of a woman in her mid-teens

463
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:13,902
cuts with a surgical-grade scalpel.

464
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:21,103
I've never told any of this to anyone.

465
00:25:22,905 --> 00:25:24,200
It must be horrible.

466
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:26,400
It is what it is.

467
00:25:28,008 --> 00:25:29,701
I'm not sure that I believe

468
00:25:30,008 --> 00:25:31,503
that I have some...

469
00:25:32,507 --> 00:25:35,303
distant relative
residing in my cerebellum.

470
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,900
I am inclined to think that...

471
00:25:41,308 --> 00:25:42,903
whatever mental demons

472
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,800
tormented my famous ancestor...

473
00:25:47,806 --> 00:25:49,900
perhaps a minute amount of that affliction

474
00:25:49,906 --> 00:25:51,602
may have been passed on to me.

475
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:54,800
I'm just trying to reassure you in my own...

476
00:25:55,408 --> 00:25:56,700
crazy way that...

477
00:25:57,607 --> 00:26:00,001
I think I got this problem under control.

478
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:02,300
<i>There's something</i>

479
00:26:02,305 --> 00:26:03,400
<i>There's something</i>
so sad about it.

480
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:06,001
He's absolutely convinced he has to spend

481
00:26:06,306 --> 00:26:08,400
his entire life slightly inebriated

482
00:26:08,406 --> 00:26:09,803
just to function.

483
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:13,100
I actually I knew any number
of friends in high school

484
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:15,000
who felt the exact same way.

485
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:16,200
Not funny.

486
00:26:16,205 --> 00:26:18,501
And they were really into
high school girls, too.

487
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,301
Undressing them, not killing them.

488
00:26:24,107 --> 00:26:26,901
Anything I can do to put
a smile on your face?

489
00:26:31,107 --> 00:26:33,003
That smile didn't last long.

490
00:26:33,705 --> 00:26:35,300
Do you hear that?

491
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:39,401
<i>...the body was found just over an hour ago</i>

492
00:26:39,405 --> 00:26:42,101
<i>by the night custodian,
here at Park-View high school.

493
00:26:42,508 --> 00:26:44,603
<i>The police has confirmed that the victim

494
00:26:44,805 --> 00:26:47,100
<i>is in fact a student here at Park-View.</i>

495
00:26:47,508 --> 00:26:50,803
<I>But authorities are still withholding
the name of the teenaged victim,</i>

496
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:53,100
- <i>as the known location of next--</i>
- Ariel?

497
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:57,203
I know, I know I'm supposed to be in bed

498
00:26:57,308 --> 00:26:58,902
I'm sorry. It's just--

499
00:27:00,107 --> 00:27:02,602
I missed the 7:00 news
'cause I was on the phone,

500
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,403
and I remembered about the late one.

501
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:07,500
Honey, why are you upset?
Why are you crying?

502
00:27:10,405 --> 00:27:11,803
It's awful.

503
00:27:14,608 --> 00:27:17,503
Some poor girl got killed
in the park tonight.

504
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:22,001
She was just four years older than me.

505
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:23,800
Okay.

506
00:27:25,107 --> 00:27:26,502
<i>...just moments ago.</i>

507
00:27:26,706 --> 00:27:29,201
</i>and our Action News cameras were there.</i>

508
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:31,503
<i>A man identified as Jack Walker</i>

509
00:27:31,707 --> 00:27:33,200
</i>was found wandering not far from...</i>

510
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:35,902
I left my meeting with Ms. Dubois,

511
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:38,602
headed back to the store.

512
00:27:39,707 --> 00:27:41,501
Cell phone started ringing--
it was Amanda.

513
00:27:41,705 --> 00:27:43,202
She was distraught.

514
00:27:43,806 --> 00:27:46,300
Her parents had found out
about the car accident,

515
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:48,302
taken her keys...

516
00:27:49,507 --> 00:27:51,201
forbidden her from driving.

517
00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:56,001
She asked me to pick her up; I did.

518
00:27:56,505 --> 00:27:58,200
We drove around forever.

519
00:27:58,705 --> 00:28:00,500
Time was going by.

520
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:04,503
I realized it had be out for so long.

521
00:28:07,508 --> 00:28:08,703
I needed a drink.

522
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:11,803
She was too young

523
00:28:11,805 --> 00:28:13,401
to take to a bar, so...

524
00:28:14,906 --> 00:28:17,200
I stopped at a liquor store.

525
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,703
I Got a bottle of whiskey.
Amanda got...

526
00:28:22,308 --> 00:28:23,503
...all excited.

527
00:28:23,607 --> 00:28:26,403
"Let's play a drinking game,
let's play a drinking game."

528
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,900
I didn't want to play a drinking game.
I just wanted a drink.

529
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:32,701
Well, we ended up parking,

530
00:28:32,906 --> 00:28:34,402
at the high school.

531
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,600
Pathetic, yeah.

532
00:28:39,108 --> 00:28:40,902
She insisted we play this game,

533
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:42,602
"I never..."

534
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:46,601
She'd announce something,
something she...

535
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:49,000
she'd never done,
something she'd never tried.

536
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:51,403
Something she'd never experienced.

537
00:28:51,907 --> 00:28:53,103
And if...

538
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:55,302
If I hadn't experienced it either,

539
00:28:56,007 --> 00:28:58,201
then I wouldn't have to take a drink.

540
00:28:59,108 --> 00:29:00,300
I mean...

541
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:04,300
I walked this earth
twice as long as her.

542
00:29:05,806 --> 00:29:07,900
There's not a lot I haven't experienced.

543
00:29:08,407 --> 00:29:10,001
Suffice to say...

544
00:29:10,805 --> 00:29:12,000
I drank

545
00:29:12,005 --> 00:29:13,900
a prodigious amount of alcohol,

546
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:15,803
in a fairly short space of time.

547
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:20,203
Next thing I can remember is

548
00:29:20,407 --> 00:29:22,401
waking up in the car, alone.

549
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:32,700
I didn't see the blood...

550
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:35,303
at first.

551
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:36,900
In the car,

552
00:29:37,006 --> 00:29:38,302
on me.

553
00:29:39,605 --> 00:29:41,201
I didn't see the knife.

554
00:29:41,807 --> 00:29:44,001
Are you suggesting
that you had a blackout?

555
00:29:44,805 --> 00:29:47,003
I'm just telling you
everything I remember.

556
00:29:47,507 --> 00:29:49,402
My client has a history of blackouts.

557
00:29:49,907 --> 00:29:51,600
He's made no secret of that.

558
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,900
For the record,

559
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:55,000
are you stating that you had

560
00:29:55,008 --> 00:29:56,803
a blackout earlier this evening?

561
00:29:57,007 --> 00:29:59,203
It's certainly happened
in the past, but...

562
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:00,702
honestly,

563
00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:03,101
I never hurt anyone before.

564
00:30:03,306 --> 00:30:05,903
Mr. Walker, on the off-chance
that you remember a little bit more

565
00:30:05,908 --> 00:30:07,303
than you're... letting on,

566
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,800
I'd like you to know that this
office is inclined to believe

567
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:12,702
that you suffer from an acute
psychological condition,

568
00:30:13,706 --> 00:30:16,101
and one that, perhaps,

569
00:30:16,908 --> 00:30:19,303
compelled you to do harm to Amanda Peyer.

570
00:30:20,305 --> 00:30:22,402
If you were to make a full confession,

571
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:25,000
we would take that
into full consideration.

572
00:30:29,105 --> 00:30:31,201
You're quite sure
I did this, aren't you?

573
00:30:36,507 --> 00:30:38,502
- Is there proof?
- Jack, if they did...

574
00:30:38,707 --> 00:30:40,501
you'd be in a cell by now.

575
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,900
The crime scene... is still fresh,

576
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:47,001
as are the warrants to search your home,

577
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:49,102
your business, and your car.

578
00:30:49,706 --> 00:30:51,501
The truth is, we're still gathering

579
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:53,902
enough physical evidence
to formally charge you,

580
00:30:54,008 --> 00:30:57,000
but I'm confident we can do that
in the 72 hours we have.

581
00:30:57,506 --> 00:30:58,802
72 hours?

582
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:01,503
That's the amount of time
they can hold you in a cell

583
00:31:01,505 --> 00:31:03,200
without charging you.

584
00:31:03,908 --> 00:31:06,003
I can't go without a drink for three days.

585
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:07,602
Sure you can.

586
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,402
An officer will be in shortly to process you.

587
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:20,602
<i>A man identified as Jack Walker
was found walking about...</i>

588
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:23,003
What are you doing up?

589
00:31:23,306 --> 00:31:25,303
Watching you work, on the news.

590
00:31:25,605 --> 00:31:27,903
<i>...and what appears to be the victim's blood,</i>

591
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:30,803
<i>still visible, on his clothing and face.</i>

592
00:31:34,806 --> 00:31:36,902
He had me completely fooled.

593
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:39,701
It's okay.

594
00:31:40,205 --> 00:31:41,701
It's not your fault.

595
00:31:42,808 --> 00:31:44,901
You had two days with the guy.

596
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,202
And Walker had a lifetime.

597
00:31:54,408 --> 00:31:56,601
<i>I'm afraid I have, yeah.</i>

598
00:31:57,406 --> 00:31:58,802
I have...

599
00:32:00,108 --> 00:32:02,502
gone into a lover's medicine cabinet

600
00:32:02,805 --> 00:32:05,001
while she lay sleeping

601
00:32:06,006 --> 00:32:07,503
in the other room, yes.

602
00:32:08,005 --> 00:32:09,001
Yes.

603
00:32:09,905 --> 00:32:11,102
It's uncanny.

604
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:14,702
It's uncanny, how, you know.

605
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:17,800
Now ask him the other one.

606
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:20,401
Ask him.

607
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:24,200
Come on!

608
00:32:25,005 --> 00:32:26,301
You won again.

609
00:32:26,305 --> 00:32:27,501
Come on.

610
00:32:28,107 --> 00:32:29,103
Okay.

611
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:31,502
I never...

612
00:32:32,507 --> 00:32:33,703
wondered

613
00:32:33,707 --> 00:32:36,202
what it would be like
to slice a girl open.

614
00:32:38,507 --> 00:32:41,603
Touch her blood with my fingertips.

615
00:32:44,106 --> 00:32:45,503
Taste it...

616
00:32:46,306 --> 00:32:48,103
with my tongue.

617
00:32:55,805 --> 00:32:57,603
I do believe...

618
00:32:58,707 --> 00:33:00,401
you're the winner again.

619
00:33:15,307 --> 00:33:16,701
Well done.

620
00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:19,702
And now the moment has come
for me, to thank you

621
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:21,402
for everything.

622
00:33:23,007 --> 00:33:25,400
You've really been sensational.

623
00:33:25,806 --> 00:33:28,200
Colliding with the car
of a perfect stranger.

624
00:33:28,408 --> 00:33:30,003
Pretending to fall
in love with him.

625
00:33:30,006 --> 00:33:31,700
Calling him incessantly.

626
00:33:32,508 --> 00:33:35,303
You're easily the
most suggestible person

627
00:33:35,507 --> 00:33:37,202
that I've ever encountered.

628
00:33:38,505 --> 00:33:41,701
If only you had the intelligence
necessary to become a physician,

629
00:33:41,906 --> 00:33:44,800
I would happily spend
the next ten, or 15 years,

630
00:33:44,908 --> 00:33:46,702
living inside your brain,

631
00:33:47,107 --> 00:33:48,501
telling you what to do.

632
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,200
But halas...

633
00:33:52,006 --> 00:33:53,601
you have no interest

634
00:33:53,606 --> 00:33:55,102
in the medical arts,

635
00:33:55,308 --> 00:33:57,302
and I have no interest

636
00:33:57,306 --> 00:33:59,802
in influencing the thinking

637
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:02,103
of a walking Kewpie doll.

638
00:34:03,507 --> 00:34:05,600
So I'm afraid this is...

639
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:07,903
...good-bye.

640
00:34:08,905 --> 00:34:10,500
Did you bring the knife?

641
00:34:11,505 --> 00:34:12,400
Yeah.

642
00:34:16,407 --> 00:34:17,703
All right, then.

643
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:20,401
Why don't we begin...

644
00:34:20,806 --> 00:34:23,501
by you stabbing yourself in the stomach?

645
00:34:25,508 --> 00:34:27,402
You don't mind if I watch, do you?

646
00:34:28,606 --> 00:34:29,501
I...

647
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:32,001
really quite enjoy this kind of thing.

648
00:34:45,206 --> 00:34:46,900
He didn't do it-- she did.

649
00:34:47,608 --> 00:34:50,403
Mr. walker, I apologize you've been
detained the past three days,

650
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:52,102
but I do have some good news.

651
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:55,201
Our crime scene unit,
at the insistence of Mrs. Dubois here,

652
00:34:55,207 --> 00:34:57,400
has re-examined all
the evidence in this case

653
00:34:57,407 --> 00:34:59,203
and is saying unequivocally,

654
00:34:59,406 --> 00:35:01,403
that Amanda's wounds
were self-inflicted.

655
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:08,701
Again...

656
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:10,801
I apologize.

657
00:35:11,908 --> 00:35:12,902
My God.

658
00:35:12,908 --> 00:35:14,602
No apology is necessary.

659
00:35:15,706 --> 00:35:17,802
Under the circumstances, I just--

660
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,600
Go home.
Get some rest.

661
00:35:19,607 --> 00:35:22,001
My office will be speaking
with your attorney.

662
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:24,002
There may still be some civil issues

663
00:35:24,005 --> 00:35:25,800
that Amanda's parents want to litigate.

664
00:35:25,808 --> 00:35:28,102
having to do with
offering alcohol to a minor,

665
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:29,403
but I do believe

666
00:35:29,405 --> 00:35:31,602
for the most part,
you're out of the woods.

667
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:35,300
I have no idea what you did,
but thank you.

668
00:35:36,305 --> 00:35:37,702
How are you feeling?

669
00:35:38,406 --> 00:35:40,203
Other than being in shock, uh...

670
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:41,501
good.

671
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,303
The first two days
without alcohol were difficult.

672
00:35:45,105 --> 00:35:46,301
Today...

673
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:49,403
Who knows?

674
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:52,301
I might actually make a habit
of this... not-drinking thing.

675
00:35:54,907 --> 00:35:56,502
Can I talk to you?

676
00:35:57,908 --> 00:35:59,403
What is it? I'm busy.

677
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:01,002
What are you doing?

678
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:02,901
I'm reading the news.

679
00:36:04,405 --> 00:36:06,102
But I don't understand.

680
00:36:06,308 --> 00:36:07,901
Why would you <i>read</i> the news

681
00:36:07,908 --> 00:36:09,800
while you could watch it on TV?

682
00:36:13,307 --> 00:36:14,700
Got it!
Hello?

683
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:16,403
Mrs. Dubois?

684
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:18,401
Jack, is that you?

685
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:20,103
Are you drinking?

686
00:36:20,508 --> 00:36:22,803
No. God knows I want to.

687
00:36:23,707 --> 00:36:25,900
- Where are you?
- I'm at the shop.

688
00:36:25,906 --> 00:36:28,200
I keep thinking I should go out.

689
00:36:28,407 --> 00:36:30,701
I kinda want to be around
some young people.

690
00:36:30,707 --> 00:36:32,000
- Girls.
- Listen to me.

691
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:34,002
Stay right where you are.
Don't go anywhere.

692
00:36:34,006 --> 00:36:35,500
I'll be there quick as I can.

693
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,401
Jack!

694
00:36:52,605 --> 00:36:54,201
Jack, are you here?

695
00:36:55,107 --> 00:36:56,002
Jack!

696
00:36:56,308 --> 00:36:57,702
Are you here?

697
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:07,503
Lovely to see you.
I do so appreciate the way

698
00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:09,501
you ran right over here
when I called.

699
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:11,601
The good doctor, I presume.

700
00:37:11,905 --> 00:37:13,600
Well, maybe not so good.

701
00:37:13,805 --> 00:37:15,803
Maybe not really a doctor either.

702
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:19,001
So how long
has it been you and not him?

703
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:20,802
In the jail?

704
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:23,000
In the interrogation room
with the lawyer?

705
00:37:23,707 --> 00:37:25,302
What about the night Amanda died?

706
00:37:25,806 --> 00:37:27,200
Oh please, I'm good.

707
00:37:27,508 --> 00:37:28,900
But not that good.

708
00:37:29,506 --> 00:37:31,400
I've really only just begun

709
00:37:31,407 --> 00:37:34,202
my residency inside young Jack's skin.

710
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:37,702
What a superb fit.

711
00:37:38,705 --> 00:37:42,102
Like a suit that's been
custom-made for me by God.

712
00:37:45,206 --> 00:37:47,000
I'll always be grateful for your help.

713
00:37:47,007 --> 00:37:48,301
My help?

714
00:37:48,305 --> 00:37:50,400
Oh my, yes.
I couldn't have done it without you.

715
00:37:50,707 --> 00:37:53,802
I've been whispering
in that boy's ear for 20 years,

716
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:55,600
trying to pierce that...

717
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:58,803
self-imposed haze of alcohol.

718
00:37:59,505 --> 00:38:01,803
I tried tempting him with that girl,

719
00:38:01,806 --> 00:38:04,202
but apparently he's managed
to rot his libido

720
00:38:04,305 --> 00:38:05,901
as well as his liver.

721
00:38:06,406 --> 00:38:08,101
And then, suddenly,

722
00:38:08,906 --> 00:38:10,602
there you were...

723
00:38:11,107 --> 00:38:12,100
screaming

724
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,401
for the police in that
supermarket parking lot,

725
00:38:14,508 --> 00:38:16,003
and I thought,
"Wait a second.

726
00:38:16,105 --> 00:38:17,703
"Your good friend Allison,

727
00:38:17,806 --> 00:38:19,601
"she's just presented you with...

728
00:38:19,705 --> 00:38:21,403
a much better idea!"

729
00:38:21,506 --> 00:38:22,503
Me?

730
00:38:22,605 --> 00:38:24,501
Well, thanks to that scene that you made,

731
00:38:24,507 --> 00:38:26,800
my drunken, impotent relative

732
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:29,902
now had the attention
of the local authorities.

733
00:38:31,805 --> 00:38:35,001
If something unfortunate
were to happen to young Amanda,

734
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:36,101
well,

735
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:38,402
he'd be the first person they'd lock up.

736
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:41,701
A man can get
awfully thirsty in a jail cell.

737
00:38:41,807 --> 00:38:43,501
Awfully thirsty.

738
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:45,902
And awfully clear-headed.

739
00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:50,100
I knew for the first time
in nearly 20 years,

740
00:38:50,807 --> 00:38:52,502
he'd finally hear me.

741
00:38:52,806 --> 00:38:54,203
And here we are.

742
00:38:54,506 --> 00:38:57,501
You did all of that
so you could finally be in the skin

743
00:38:57,607 --> 00:38:59,702
of someone who looked
exactly like you did?

744
00:38:59,908 --> 00:39:01,701
when you ravaged teenage girls?

745
00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:03,803
Allison.

746
00:39:04,205 --> 00:39:06,102
I did all that so I could
be inside the skin

747
00:39:06,205 --> 00:39:08,102
of someone who looked like me...

748
00:39:10,108 --> 00:39:11,702
when I ravaged you.

749
00:39:16,308 --> 00:39:17,802
I know what you're thinking.

750
00:39:17,906 --> 00:39:19,300
Where's the scalpel?

751
00:39:19,308 --> 00:39:21,002
Where's the surgical saw?

752
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,303
Help!

753
00:39:22,406 --> 00:39:25,600
One of my great disappointments
as I spend time with my progeny,

754
00:39:26,806 --> 00:39:28,501
is their compete and utter

755
00:39:28,507 --> 00:39:30,501
lack of interest in the medical arts.

756
00:39:31,308 --> 00:39:32,402
Oh, well!

757
00:39:32,408 --> 00:39:34,703
What's a great-great grandfather to do?

758
00:39:35,107 --> 00:39:36,403
Adapt, I say.

759
00:39:39,106 --> 00:39:40,203
And so,

760
00:39:40,307 --> 00:39:42,101
in a one-time-only performance,

761
00:39:42,108 --> 00:39:44,301
tonight's slaying will be performed

762
00:39:44,305 --> 00:39:45,601
bare-handed!

763
00:39:45,608 --> 00:39:48,903
I know you're flattered, Allison.
Try not to get too choked up.

764
00:40:03,408 --> 00:40:05,401
If all you wanted to do was kill me,

765
00:40:05,406 --> 00:40:07,400
why did you send me
all of those dreams?

766
00:40:10,606 --> 00:40:12,001
You didn't.

767
00:40:12,405 --> 00:40:14,201
Did you?
She did.

768
00:40:14,808 --> 00:40:16,100
To stop you.

769
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:17,901
You know nothing of Maura.

770
00:40:18,006 --> 00:40:19,100
I do!

771
00:40:19,706 --> 00:40:21,202
She's here!

772
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:23,601
She never stopped watching you.

773
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,600
She sees you even now.

774
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:27,703
What you're doing to me.

775
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:30,902
What you're doing to her
great-great grandson.

776
00:40:31,607 --> 00:40:33,101
If you kill me,

777
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:36,303
Jack is going to spend
the rest of his life in prison.

778
00:40:36,808 --> 00:40:38,401
and do you honestly think

779
00:40:38,505 --> 00:40:41,903
she loves him any less
than the child she died for?

780
00:41:22,905 --> 00:41:24,401
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

781
00:41:29,006 --> 00:41:30,702
What am I doing here?

782
00:41:35,005 --> 00:41:36,700
<i>What are ghosts really?</i>

783
00:41:36,907 --> 00:41:38,200
They're energy.

784
00:41:38,406 --> 00:41:40,101
The energy we leave behind.

785
00:41:40,406 --> 00:41:41,803
And energy is power.

786
00:41:42,605 --> 00:41:45,000
<i>Who knows what might happen
when a spirit as powerful</i>

787
00:41:45,007 --> 00:41:47,901
as Charles Walker's finally
decides to cross over?

788
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:51,403
Or what would happen if the other side
just decided to take him?

789
00:41:51,606 --> 00:41:53,700
I'd like to believe that's what I saw.

790
00:41:53,806 --> 00:41:55,702
That he's finally gone for good.

791
00:41:56,308 --> 00:41:58,603
<i>I guess we're just
gonna have to wait and see.</i>

792
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,103
I guess we'll just have
to wait and see.

793
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:06,401
