1
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:25,288
Pardon me, ma'am, but why'd you stop?

2
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,998
Who are you? What are you doing here?

3
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:28,863
What am I doing her? What are you doing here?

4
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:30,920
Where's Joe? What'd you do with Joe? 

5
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:31,837
Who's Joe?

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,993
Ouch. Wait a second.

7
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:38,806
Hey, look at that. Is it yours?

8
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:42,129
You think it belongs to somebody out there?

9
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:47,873
Oh, my God.

10
00:00:49,184 --> 00:00:50,453
What am I going to do?

11
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:51,703
What am I going to do?

12
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:54,064
What are you going to do? What am I going to do?

13
00:00:54,203 --> 00:00:56,240
I got a strange gun in my coffin.

14
00:00:56,419 --> 00:00:58,744
I don't want to meet my maker with a strange gun in my coffin.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,884
- What about me?
- You I'd keep.

16
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:03,388
It's this gun I'm having a problem with. 


17
00:01:06,555 --> 00:01:09,747
Look, I know we're in the middle of something here, but I have to get that.

18
00:01:09,843 --> 00:01:12,594
Hey, hon? Just stay where you are. I'll get it.

19
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:14,642
Thanks, hon.

20
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,714
Thanks, hon.

21
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:19,357
Nice guy.

22
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:21,046
Oh, which reminds me.

23
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,832
There's something very important I have to tell you about him.

24
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:25,850
Joe? You have to tell me something about Joe?

25
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,774
As long as you're here.

26
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:29,587
Australia.

27
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,093
Excuse me?

28
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:32,889
Australia.

29
00:01:33,278 --> 00:01:36,613
That's the message. That's what I have to say to you: "Australia".

30
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,071
- "Australia"? The place...
- Just Australia.

31
00:01:42,192 --> 00:01:43,320
Australia.

32
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:45,828
That's it.

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,648
You can wake up now.

34
00:01:48,804 --> 00:01:51,439
I know I made a fuss, but don't worry about the gun. You can leave it here.

35
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:57,009
It's okay. Roll over. My feelings won't be hurt.

36
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:02,950
Yes, yes, absolutely. 9:30.

37
00:02:52,163 --> 00:02:56,459
Bagel for Marie, pancakes for Ariel, cereal for Bridgett.

38
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:59,228
It's morning, we're cooking, we're happy.

39
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:01,840
***, somebody do something about your sister.

40
00:03:02,853 --> 00:03:05,004
- She's hungry.
- We're all hungry.

41
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:08,444
Bridgette, you want cereal. You can do that yourself, can't you?

42
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,361
Okay.

43
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,662
Daddy, these eggs are bad. There's a thingy on the yolk.

44
00:03:13,765 --> 00:03:14,870
Thingy? What kind of thingy?

45
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:18,427
A thingy. A white dot on the yolk. Like the egg's almost hatched.

46
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,905
You mean like there was an unborn chicken in the bowl?

47
00:03:22,648 --> 00:03:25,440
There's no unborn chicken in the bowl. There's no born chicken in the bowl.

48
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:29,785
There's no chicken of any kind in the bowl. Perfectly natural for there to be a thingy on the eggs.

49
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:34,024
Look, look, look. See? See what daddy made for you?

50
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:38,826
- You just have to let it cool off a little bit.
- I'm sorry. I don't care what you say, these eggs are bad.

51
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:41,090
Okay, fine. You win. They're bad. Get two more.

52
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:43,962
There's nothing wrong with those eggs. Those are perfectly fine eggs.

53
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,714
- Morning.
- I just got those eggs yesterday.

54
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:48,899
- Ariel wanted pancakes.
- Not with the rotten eggs! Hello?

55
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,430
Those eggs are fine.

56
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:53,813
Why did you let me sleep in, why didn't you wake me?

57
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:56,476
I don't know. You looked happy. You looked like you were having a nice dream.

58
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:57,802
Were you having a nice dream?

59
00:03:58,331 --> 00:03:59,297
It was okay.

60
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,197
Who were you talking to on the phone?

61
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:02,957
Huh? Oh, nobody.

62
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:08,344
Nobody? Joe, I saw you talking on the phone to nobody at 7:15 this morning.

63
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:10,643
- It was Opsy.
- Honey, you're eating.

64
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:15,282
It was a call from Dr. Katkoff's office. I have this thing this morning. It was just a reminder call.

65
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:16,639
A thing? What thing?

66
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,128
Don't you remember, Daddy? You were talking to somebody named Opsy.

67
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,081
- Bridge!
- Don't you remember?

68
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,903
- You said, "Bye, Opsy!"
- Opsy?

69
00:04:25,086 --> 00:04:26,356
Bye, Opsy.

70
00:04:26,707 --> 00:04:29,070
Bye, Opsy. Bye, Opsy. Bye, Opsy.

71
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:31,215
Biopsy? You're having a biopsy?

72
00:04:32,143 --> 00:04:34,068
Why wouldn't you tell me something like this?

73
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,057
I did. I did tell you. You knew I was going for a physical.

74
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,532
Yeah, you told me you were fine.

75
00:04:38,642 --> 00:04:42,238
And I was fine. I am fine. Everything's fine. It's just a follow-up. It's nothing.

76
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,069
It's a biopsy, Joe. "Biopsy" and "nothing" don't go together.

77
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:48,520
People don't get a biopsy for the hell of it. You get a biopsy for a reason.

78
00:04:48,614 --> 00:04:51,413
And I don't understand why you wouldn't you tell me something like this.

79
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:54,209
- Why? Take a look at yourself.
- Excuse me? What does that mean?

80
00:04:54,286 --> 00:04:57,978
It means I think that your reaction to this is completly out of scale with what is actually going on.

81
00:04:58,044 --> 00:05:00,395
- I think you're getting a little hysterical.
- Hysterical, really?

82
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:04,582
My husband just told me he needs a biopsy and he's been keeping this information from me.

83
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,164
How would you like me to react?

84
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:09,601
You know what this is about? And I know you don't want to hear this, but with this new job of yours...

85
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:10,838
- My job?
- One week you're busy... 

86
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:12,985
- What has that got to do with keeping life altering events 
- And the next week you're sitting around here... 

87
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,586
- ...waiting for the phone to ring 
- ...from me ?

88
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:16,927
...and frankly, I was worried that if I told you I needed to have this little test done...

89
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,006
- "Little test"?
- ...when you had too much time on your hands,

90
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:21,877
you'd sit around here and obsess about it and drive yourself crazy.

91
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:26,603
- Boy, was I wrong.
- What, exactly, is this biopsy for?

92
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:28,856
You know that little mole I have my back? The one I've had forever?

93
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:30,899
- Katkoff just thought it was finally time.
- Lay down.

94
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:33,107
- What?
- Lay down! I want to see it!

95
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:35,574
See? This is exactly what I'm talking about.

96
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:38,019
When you were in school, you were so busy studying doubtful process 

97
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:41,888
I could have been sitting in front of the Tv dead for three days and you wouldn't have noticed.

98
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:43,755
- Australia.
- What?

99
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,143
Australia.

100
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,563
It used to be round. Now it's shaped like Australia.

101
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:52,404
- It itches. I scratched it. I shouldn't have.
- Don't.

102
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:56,213
If I keep scratching it, I might get it look like the entire easten hemisphere.

103
00:05:56,494 --> 00:05:57,559
Can I get up now?

104
00:06:02,117 --> 00:06:02,909
What?

105
00:06:03,683 --> 00:06:04,574
Nothing.

106
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:09,618
Listen to me. It's nothing, okay?

107
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:12,403
All right.

108
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,339
Nicholas Morgante is a father, is a husband, is a business man.

109
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:21,573
He... he's a Little League coach. He's a lot of things.

110
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:23,882
But the one thing he's not is a cop-killer.

111
00:06:23,944 --> 00:06:29,800
On the contrary, this man has enjoyed a friendly, long-standing relationship with the Phoenix Police Department

112
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,918
and considered a lot of the men on the force to be close, personal friends.

113
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:36,917
Mr. Watt, you said in a press conference yesterday that you were anticipating a speedy trial.

114
00:06:36,974 --> 00:06:40,190
- Why are you so confident?
- Well, for one thing. My client is innocent.

115
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,276
For another, we know the late Detective was shot to death,

116
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:47,223
but to date, I've yet to hear about the murder weapon.

117
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,517
Has the District Attorney found the gun?

118
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:51,480
It's not on my evidence list.

119
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:55,861
Detective Pulaski was a highly valued and much-honored member of our police force.

120
00:06:56,395 --> 00:07:00,475
I personally had the pleasure of working with him many times over the past 15 years.

121
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:04,622
For the record, I'm especially committed to bringing his killer to justice.

122
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:05,821
Thank you.

123
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:10,454
Ladies and gentlemen, no testimonial evidence has been presented which can place

124
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:14,935
the murder weapon in Nicholas Morgante's personal possession prior to the shooting.

125
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,580
No physical evidence has been presented

126
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:23,531
which can place the murder weapon in Nicholas Morgante's personal possession prior to the shooting.

127
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:25,684
So what are we left with, ladies and gentlemen?

128
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:31,575
In America, is it enough for the police or the District Attorney to say,

129
00:07:32,194 --> 00:07:33,493
"I just think he did it"?

130
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:37,759
- I think I know where it is.
- You think you know where what is ? 

131
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:40,284
The murder weapon. The gun.

132
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,541
Counselor?

133
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,956
Mr. District Attorney?

134
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:49,137
- Welcome back.
- I'm terribly sorry, Your Honor.

135
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:52,260
And is there something you'd like to share with the rest of the court, Counsel?

136
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,926
Well, Your Honor, as a matter of fact, in the interest of justice, 

137
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,181
the prosecution respectfully asks the court for a recess

138
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:02,198
due to an introduction of new evidence brought to our attention.

139
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:05,490
Evidence that has a substantial bearing on the outcome of this case.

140
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:11,628
In the casket, burried with detective Pulaski's body.

141
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:14,858
- And you're sure?
- Pretty sure. Yeah.

142
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:23,051
Allison, I'm about to go ask for a court order to disturb this man's grave, exhume his body,

143
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:27,464
open his casket and feel around, I'd like to go to the judge with a little more than pretty sure. 


144
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:31,945
Well I don't know what to tell you, it is a dream. You have to allow for a certain margin of error.

145
00:08:38,002 --> 00:08:41,410
Kind of inspired, isn't it? Bury the murder weapon with the victim.

146
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:43,955
"Rest on piece"?

147
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:50,034
I'll get a warrant.

148
00:09:05,138 --> 00:09:06,690
It's so unfair.

149
00:09:10,243 --> 00:09:15,240
Those earrings, I could tell you where you got them, when you got them, why they mean so much to you.

150
00:09:15,327 --> 00:09:20,876
but when it comes to my own husband, my own children, or anything to do with my own life.

151
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:24,144
- Everything's a blur.
- True for all of us, I'm afraid.

152
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:28,031
- Kind of an elegant irony, isn't it?
- You think so?

153
00:09:28,241 --> 00:09:30,846
Hey, what we don't know can't hurt us.

154
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:38,209
But then you didn't come here to philosophize, did you? You came here for answers.

155
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,068
I'm worried about my husband.

156
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:41,833
I know.

157
00:09:42,735 --> 00:09:44,322
Do I have a reason to be?

158
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:48,592
You know, I normally hesitate doing this kind of thing.

159
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:52,636
People have trouble understanding when you talk to them about their futures.

160
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:55,894
The days of our lives are a lot like the weather.

161
00:09:56,456 --> 00:10:01,392
If you look long enough and hard enough, you can absolutely find a miserable day on the horizon.

162
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,010
Conversely, if you're patient enough, there's always a sunny one coming, too.

163
00:10:07,623 --> 00:10:11,837
I think the key is to focus on something fairly narrow.

164
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,892
Keep the questions specific.

165
00:10:14,678 --> 00:10:16,532
Well, this is very specific.

166
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:19,666
- Because you know I can't lie.
- I'm not asking you to lie.

167
00:10:20,976 --> 00:10:22,159
All right, then.

168
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:29,517
Uh... there's something medical going on, right?

169
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:32,270
Yes.

170
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:38,575
- It's... of no consequence 
- Oh my god, really?

171
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:42,388
This biopsy business, it's nothing. You can put it right out of your mind. 


172
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,352
- So he's healthy?
- Yes, he's healthy. He's extremely healthy.

173
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:48,998
- You're sure?
- Yes. I'm sure. I'm absolutely sure.

174
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:50,602
So everything's okay?

175
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:56,982
- Catherine?
- Allison, I warned you.

176
00:10:57,145 --> 00:11:00,632
- "Everything" is a very big word.
- What do you mean?

177
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,984
- Oh, my God. It's not one of my children?
- Don't do this to me.

178
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,288
No, it's not the children.

179
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:11,814
The... the subject was your husband.

180
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:14,532
- But you said he was healthy.
- And he is.

181
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:18,905
So who is it? Is somebody sick? You said you couldn't lie.

182
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:20,743
No, nobody is sick.

183
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,592
Then why are you looking that way?

184
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,342
What is it you're not telling me?

185
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:32,069
It's your marriage, dear.

186
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:33,943
My marriage?

187
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:36,012
What about my marriage?

188
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:45,918
Oh... There's a... a darkness there.

189
00:11:46,158 --> 00:11:48,171
A very real darkness.

190
00:11:49,518 --> 00:11:51,475
A crisis of some kind.

191
00:11:52,508 --> 00:11:55,445
It's imminent and it's significant.

192
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,870
I... I wish I could tell you more, but...

193
00:12:00,715 --> 00:12:02,021
that's all I see.

194
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:13,469
Mom, I just felt Bridgette's toothbrush and it's completely dry. Completely.

195
00:12:13,592 --> 00:12:17,893
And then I checked that special toothpaste she made you buy her. And it hasn't even been opened.

196
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:21,123
She's lying, Mom. My toothbrush is soaking wet. You can check it.

197
00:12:21,293 --> 00:12:24,968
That's because she just wet it. That's because she just ran it under water.

198
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:27,754
But she didn't actually brush her teeth with it.

199
00:12:27,836 --> 00:12:30,872
That tooth brush has never seen the inside of her mouth.

200
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:34,170
Has, too, liar! It's seen it a lot.

201
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:35,988
Mom, are you even listening?

202
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:39,249
Mom? Mom...!

203
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:43,580
If you're so worried about Dad, why don't you just call him?

204
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:45,486
I'm not worried about Dad. I'm fine.

205
00:12:45,992 --> 00:12:47,528
Did you brush your teeth?

206
00:12:48,588 --> 00:12:49,643
What?

207
00:12:50,205 --> 00:12:51,762
Okay, bedtime.

208
00:12:53,247 --> 00:12:57,511
Let's not worry. I'm sure Daddy just got tied up in traffic or his cell phone broke

209
00:12:57,604 --> 00:13:00,077
- or something came up...
- Hello, hello, hello...

210
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,153
There he is.

211
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:04,184
Well... hi.

212
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:06,021
- Hi.
- Hi.

213
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:07,133
Hi.

214
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,194
Sorry.

215
00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:13,584
Two steps from the door and Starkey calls a meeting.

216
00:13:13,681 --> 00:13:15,422
- You didn't call.
- No. I know.

217
00:13:15,515 --> 00:13:19,058
There's no service in that wing for some reason. And you know, I tried to break away...

218
00:13:19,144 --> 00:13:22,277
And you couldn't. And you couldn't get your assistant to call?

219
00:13:27,136 --> 00:13:29,553
Girls. Come here, give me kiss good night.

220
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:44,288
Remind me to call somebody tomorrow. There must be something wrong with that thermostat.

221
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:46,604
It's really hot in this room.

222
00:13:46,987 --> 00:13:49,393
- I was worried, Joe.
- I said I was sorry.

223
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:52,016
It's 9:00. How am I supposed to know you're okay?

224
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:53,945
How do I know you're not lying dead somewhere?

225
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:56,751
If something had happened, somebody would've called.

226
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:59,714
If I were dead, who are we kidding, you'd be the first to know.

227
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:03,163
Not funny. Come, eat.

228
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,501
No, they already brought food in.

229
00:14:07,652 --> 00:14:09,905
So aren't you going to ask me how my biopsy went?

230
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:12,628
How'd your biopsy go?

231
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,395
Fine.

232
00:14:15,446 --> 00:14:19,346
So can I get an estimate on how long it's going to take for you to reach room temperature again?

233
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:21,926
'Cause if there's time, I'd like to sneak in a shower here.

234
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,781
A shower? You never shower at night.

235
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:29,386
What can I tell you? I've been sitting with 20 people in a room built for ten.

236
00:14:29,555 --> 00:14:31,711
They shut off the air at 6:30.

237
00:14:32,002 --> 00:14:34,373
Does the shower not work after 9:00?

238
00:14:35,387 --> 00:14:37,895
- Fine. Go shower.
- Thank you.

239
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,821
Hey. I'm sorry.

240
00:14:51,387 --> 00:14:53,917
Hey. You're forgiven.

241
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:55,179
And, uh...

242
00:14:56,337 --> 00:14:57,776
I'm sorry I didn't call.

243
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,002
- Wow. Your lips are room temperature.
- Really?

244
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:16,096
What's the prognosis, Doc?

245
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:19,220
What are you doing? Hey.

246
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:22,286
Just relax. I want to be able to tell if it's growing.

247
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:24,954
Very nice. This makes tremendous sense to me.

248
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:28,097
I might not die from skin cancer, so you want to seal the deal with ink poisoning.

249
00:15:28,184 --> 00:15:31,477
Be still. This is a very delicate procedure.

250
00:15:33,902 --> 00:15:34,838
Done.

251
00:15:40,487 --> 00:15:44,660
If I knew I'd get this kind of reaction, I would've outlined all your moles.

252
00:15:47,728 --> 00:15:50,974
So tomorrow they exhume the body? They look for the gun?

253
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,406
You nervous?

254
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:57,498
Don't be. It'll be there.

255
00:15:57,635 --> 00:15:59,459
Why are we talking about this now?

256
00:15:59,587 --> 00:16:02,372
It's your work. I thought you found it interesting.

257
00:16:02,786 --> 00:16:04,919
I thought you wanted me to find it interesting.

258
00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:11,470
Well, don't go away mad.

259
00:16:11,664 --> 00:16:13,938
I don't know, Al, I think I'll take a rain check.

260
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,913
You're putting out a weird energy tonight.

261
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:18,731
You're the one who came home from work three hours late.

262
00:16:18,822 --> 00:16:22,386
I said I was sorry. Isn't there a statute of limitations on this kind of thing?

263
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:30,641
Are we okay?

264
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:34,499
Of course we're okay. I'm just...

265
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,229
We're both tired. We're both cranky. That's all.

266
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:03,259
Mommy, you're dropping stuff.

267
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:06,049
- This came out of Daddy's pants.
- Thank you.

268
00:17:09,723 --> 00:17:12,855
Mom? What are we waiting for? We're gonna be late.

269
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,751
Mom?!

270
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:36,111
Sir.

271
00:17:38,645 --> 00:17:41,362
Go over it for prints, then let's get it to ballistics.

272
00:17:56,068 --> 00:18:01,243
I'm nothing less than to stun by the Judge's decision to allow this gun as admissible evidence.

273
00:18:01,316 --> 00:18:04,996
And while I have the utmost respect for his honour, to ask this jury

274
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:10,880
to believe that my client defiled the grave of a decorated police officer and a friend,

275
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:15,159
and somehow managed to hide this weapon in a coffin that stood open

276
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:18,688
and in full view of family and friends for two days...

277
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:23,491
Well, I just can't understand why the District Attorney doesn't just do the honorable thing

278
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:29,752
and go to the jury and admit, "We don't actually have a case, so we planted evidence."

279
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,713
Excuse me.

280
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:39,757
He's acting like he doesn't know what hit him, and I'm guessing that's because he doesn't.

281
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:45,030
Now go home, and dream some more and tell me how long it takes me to win this case.

282
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:47,754
- Allison Dubois?
- Yes?

283
00:18:47,988 --> 00:18:52,828
You're ordered to appear and give testimony in the matter of The State of Arizona v. Nicholas Morgante.

284
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:56,484
It's called an "on-call" subpoena. Half the people in the office get them.

285
00:18:56,572 --> 00:18:59,012
There's a number at the bottom. You call before 7:00 every morning,

286
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:00,851
and they'll let you know if you have to appear.

287
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:04,650
If you want, I'll have the office call in for you, give you a few extra minutes of sleep in the morning.

288
00:19:04,742 --> 00:19:07,650
Oh, it's okay. I have kids. I'm up at the crack of dawn anyway.

289
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:09,720
But why would they want me to testify?

290
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,798
They don't. It's a nuisance tactic.

291
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,422
The more you spend worrying about whether or not you're going to testify,

292
00:19:15,515 --> 00:19:18,166
the less time you have to prepare a case against their client.

293
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,189
That's me. Bye.

294
00:19:25,136 --> 00:19:25,894
Hey.

295
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:28,853
I just got your message. Congratulations.

296
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,208
Yeah, it's been quite a day. How's yours going?

297
00:19:31,454 --> 00:19:34,653
Uh, not so good. Looks like we're going to be pulling an all-nighter here.

298
00:19:34,894 --> 00:19:36,262
An all-nighter?

299
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,247
Well, not all night, but we're not going to get out of here until at least 9:00.

300
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:44,136
Anyway, soon as I heard I made up my business to sneak out of the meeting I was in and call you.

301
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:46,042
- Thanks.
- Listen, I gotta go.

302
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:48,847
Kiss the kids for me. I'll try and call later.

303
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,592
Okay. Bye.

304
00:20:56,952 --> 00:20:57,742
Hello?

305
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,149
Hello?

306
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,365
Hello?

307
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:40,648
No. Great. I'll see you around 10:00. Okay, bye.

308
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:45,378
I'm sorry about last night. What was it, like 11.30 when I stumbled in? 


309
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:49,307
I think some of these guys actually just want to work late just to break some record or something. 


310
00:21:49,398 --> 00:21:52,170
It's like they don't have a life outside of that place. 

311
00:21:52,698 --> 00:21:53,770
So what are you doing today?

312
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:57,859
Well, I'm not going to testify if that what you mean. Court's in recess.

313
00:21:57,969 --> 00:22:01,297
Devalos wants to talk to me about something. He's going to come by around 10:00.

314
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:05,051
- I thought you hated that shirt?
- Huh?

315
00:22:05,152 --> 00:22:08,102
That shirt. The one you're wearing. I bought it for you.

316
00:22:08,198 --> 00:22:10,240
I liked it, and you hated it.

317
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,583
- I never hated it.
- You never wore it. You said it was juvenile.

318
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:17,625
So what happened? Your shirt suddenly matured?

319
00:22:17,758 --> 00:22:20,830
- You wanted me to wear another shirt?
- I'm just saying, I don't get it.

320
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,727
You don't hate something for two years and suddenly you like it.

321
00:22:23,847 --> 00:22:26,503
I guess I finally get what you get. It's stylish.

322
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:29,310
I like the shirt. Makes me feel good, has a nice cut.

323
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:32,786
My wife bought it for me.

324
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,917
I guess it doesn't seem juvenile to me anymore.

325
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:38,120
I see.

326
00:22:39,777 --> 00:22:40,777
You taking the kids?

327
00:22:41,418 --> 00:22:42,103
Yeah.

328
00:22:43,307 --> 00:22:47,733
Got a call late last night. You're definitely testifying tomorrow when trial resumes.

329
00:22:47,836 --> 00:22:48,836
Oh.

330
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:51,632
Okay. I guess.

331
00:22:51,734 --> 00:22:55,150
In fact, you're at the top of their witness list.

332
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:59,417
Wait a second, I'm confused. The other day you said that serving me with a subpoena was no big deal,

333
00:22:59,514 --> 00:23:01,473
that they were just creating a new sense.

334
00:23:01,586 --> 00:23:03,443
Now I'm at the top of their list?

335
00:23:04,356 --> 00:23:07,980
- You know what probable cause is?
- Of course I know what probable cause is.

336
00:23:08,093 --> 00:23:10,284
Well, when you told me you thought you knew where the gun was,

337
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:14,514
in order to exhume Pulaski's body, I needed a search warrant.

338
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:15,815
Okay.

339
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:19,982
And in order to get that warrant, I had to show probable cause

340
00:23:20,084 --> 00:23:24,671
which is especially sensitive in this case. I mean, we were disturbing a dead man's grave.

341
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:27,983
- Okay. So?
- So, unfortunately,

342
00:23:28,552 --> 00:23:32,858
there is no judge who will issue a warrant based on the dream of a... a...

343
00:23:32,935 --> 00:23:35,055
- A nut like me?
- Come on, Allison.

344
00:23:35,143 --> 00:23:37,696
Let's not make this any harder than it has to be.

345
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:39,591
- It wasn't going to happen.
- So?

346
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,387
- So did what was necessary.
- I don't know what that means.

347
00:23:42,474 --> 00:23:45,270
It means that sometimes you have to consider the greater good.

348
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,103
I still don't know what that means.

349
00:23:48,408 --> 00:23:53,185
I requested the warrant based on information we received from an anonymous tip. 


350
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:54,358
You lied.

351
00:23:54,572 --> 00:23:57,430
And I indicated you were the one who received the tip.

352
00:24:11,315 --> 00:24:15,770
So tomorrow, they're gonna want me to get up on the stand, put my hand on a Bible,

353
00:24:16,082 --> 00:24:19,046
and swear to the fact that I actually received this tip?

354
00:24:19,139 --> 00:24:20,699
At the very least.

355
00:24:22,032 --> 00:24:23,798
But here is my bigger fear.

356
00:24:25,574 --> 00:24:28,216
You're Morgante. You've killed a police detective.

357
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:33,731
Now somehow, you've managed to slip the murder weapon into your victim's casket prior to his burial.

358
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:38,057
What are the chances that you told somebody-- anybody-- about what you did and how you did it,

359
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:40,981
knowing that one slip of the tongue could cost you your life.

360
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,110
I think they know there was no tip.

361
00:24:44,697 --> 00:24:48,851
I think they might have heard about you. I think they may have heard about what you do.

362
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:50,356
Well then I can tell the truth.

363
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:55,358
Allison, you're not getting this. The warrant's dirty, I lied to get it.

364
00:24:55,441 --> 00:25:00,294
If you get on the stand and say anything other than what I told the judge in the first place,

365
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:05,342
he tosses out the gun as evidence. Not to mention my credibility with the jury is nil.

366
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:09,663
All of a sudden it's not so hard to believe we're capable of planting Morgante's fingerprints on the gun.

367
00:25:09,724 --> 00:25:13,175
Planting the gun on the body, planting everything.

368
00:25:13,426 --> 00:25:17,573
- That's it and you want me to lie.
- I want you to stick to the story.

369
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,346
You work in my office. You're a consultant,

370
00:25:19,427 --> 00:25:23,462
and if he starts asking anything about dreams or psychic phenomenon... 


371
00:25:23,538 --> 00:25:25,147
- Oh my god.
- Just deny it, 

372
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,999
The more matter-of-factly you deny it, the sillier and more desperate he sounds.

373
00:25:28,112 --> 00:25:29,535
I don't know if I can do this.

374
00:25:29,626 --> 00:25:33,318
Allison, I did a terrible thing to you, and I'm sorry, but here we are.

375
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,579
This isn't easy for me, coming here, asking you for this

376
00:25:37,296 --> 00:25:42,456
I'm an attorney, I believe in the law, I believe in the truth but I know this son of a bitch killed a police officer.

377
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:47,613
He killed a police officer and then made the man's final resting place his own private joke.

378
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,746
If there ever was a reason to lie, I...

379
00:25:52,923 --> 00:25:53,992
I'm sorry.

380
00:25:55,934 --> 00:25:57,273
I need to think.

381
00:26:04,182 --> 00:26:05,953
- Joe Dubois. 
- Hi, it's me.

382
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:06,849
Hey, Al.

383
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:10,085
Look. Something's happened and I need you home at the regular time tonight.

384
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:11,996
I really need you here.

385
00:26:12,235 --> 00:26:15,431
Babe, you gotta know, if I could be here I would, but I ?hardly smile?.

386
00:26:15,502 --> 00:26:16,839
No, you're not hearing me.

387
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:22,122
You tell Kelly not tonight. You tell Kelly your wife needs you, home with her.

388
00:26:23,413 --> 00:26:25,767
Okay. Sure.

389
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,653
Thank you.

390
00:26:34,211 --> 00:26:35,255
Good night, baby.

391
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:36,505
Good night, Mommy.

392
00:26:39,503 --> 00:26:42,527
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Mommy.

393
00:26:49,382 --> 00:26:52,064
You know, you ask me to come home. You said it was important. 


394
00:26:52,157 --> 00:26:54,466
You haven't said a word to me since I got here.

395
00:26:54,657 --> 00:26:56,966
You want to clue me in on this crisis?

396
00:26:57,757 --> 00:27:00,278
Well, my boss stopped by the house today.

397
00:27:03,326 --> 00:27:05,913
Seems I've being called to testify tomorrow.

398
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:10,396
And he wanted to know if it wouldn't be too much trouble if, 

399
00:27:10,508 --> 00:27:13,696
when I got on the stand, I wouldn't mind perjuring myself.

400
00:27:13,784 --> 00:27:15,443
And why would he want you to do that?

401
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:19,555
Well, it seems you can't get a search warrant in Arizona based on a psychic's dream,

402
00:27:19,615 --> 00:27:24,480
so he told the court that I got an anonymous tip and he wants me to testify to that.

403
00:27:26,148 --> 00:27:30,343
Well, I know that's not what you want to hear, but it sounds like pretty good advice to me.

404
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:33,997
Did you hear any of what I just said? They want me to lie in court.

405
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:36,180
- Yeah, I heard you.
- I can't lie!

406
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:39,469
I beg to differ, honey. Wasn't it just last week you told the cousins 

407
00:27:39,565 --> 00:27:41,469
they couldn't come visit 'cause we were getting the house painted?

408
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,950
This is in court. This is under oath.

409
00:27:44,023 --> 00:27:47,954
I heard that part, but, really, what choice do you have?

410
00:27:48,037 --> 00:27:49,982
- You don't understand.
- Well I think I do.

411
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:51,533
No, you don't, Joe.

412
00:27:51,815 --> 00:27:57,442
If I lie, I don't just betray myself, I betray whatever it is that makes it possible for me to see this stuff

413
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,472
Really? You think so?

414
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:01,307
You think if you get up there on the stand and testify, then that's it?

415
00:28:01,502 --> 00:28:03,905
No more scary dreams, no more hearing other people's thoughts, 

416
00:28:03,992 --> 00:28:06,675
no more dead people hanging around the house and killing the mood 


417
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,230
'cause I gotta tell you Allison, if that's the case,

418
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:10,877
it's all the more reason to get up there and lie.

419
00:28:10,976 --> 00:28:14,378
You know what, Joe? I made a mistake. I shouldn't have called you. Go back to work.

420
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,263
- Don't push me, Al.
- What does that mean?

421
00:28:16,335 --> 00:28:20,457
It means, the way I'm feeling and the way you've been acting-- don't tempt me.

422
00:28:20,989 --> 00:28:24,815
- Whoa. Okay, so you're not a happy guy, huh?
- Not right now. Not about this.

423
00:28:24,881 --> 00:28:28,516
Wait, wait. Let's be clear about this. About what?

424
00:28:28,592 --> 00:28:31,936
This. This pathological need that you seem to have 

425
00:28:32,032 --> 00:28:35,996
to call the world's attention to the fact that you're... the way you are. 


426
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:37,968
- The way I am?
- Oh, please.

427
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:42,191
No! No! You know me, Joe. I am not a religious person.

428
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:45,211
I'm not a Holy Roller, praise-the-Lord type,

429
00:28:45,285 --> 00:28:48,229
but whatever it is that allowed me to see that gun?

430
00:28:48,355 --> 00:28:50,199
It comes from a higher place,

431
00:28:50,343 --> 00:28:52,555
and I didn't want it and I didn't ask for it

432
00:28:52,626 --> 00:28:56,671
and sometimes I wish I never had it, but the fact is, I do have it.

433
00:28:56,737 --> 00:29:00,681
It is a part of me. And I'm proud of it, and to be put in this position...

434
00:29:00,762 --> 00:29:02,696
What position? I'm baffled.

435
00:29:02,984 --> 00:29:05,784
What is it that you actually want to do? You want to get up there and tell the truth?

436
00:29:05,889 --> 00:29:08,165
- Yeah. I do!
- Are you crazy?

437
00:29:08,263 --> 00:29:10,972
Are you really that self-deluded? Leave it alone.

438
00:29:11,108 --> 00:29:13,435
I can't believe you're even entertaining the notion of it;

439
00:29:13,522 --> 00:29:16,280
Have you tought it through? Have you thought even half way through?

440
00:29:16,342 --> 00:29:17,637
Let it ring!

441
00:29:18,011 --> 00:29:21,748
Can you imagine the front page of our local paper if you do this?

442
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,416
Can you imagine the 6:00 news?

443
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:29,265
Have you thought about the impact that's going to have on our girls, at school, in the playground?

444
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:33,218
Have you thought about the impact that's gonna have on me, at my job, out in the world?

445
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:37,842
This isn't about you. And whatever cosmic channel your getting your vibes from.

446
00:29:37,918 --> 00:29:41,777
This is about all of us. Is this something you really wanna do?

447
00:29:41,859 --> 00:29:43,027
I don't know!

448
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:46,124
Hello!

449
00:29:47,497 --> 00:29:48,332
Yeah.

450
00:29:49,924 --> 00:29:51,153
Just a moment.

451
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,734
It's for you. It's Kelly.

452
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:58,532
Hello.

453
00:29:59,555 --> 00:30:01,855
No, it's a family thing.

454
00:30:02,786 --> 00:30:06,733
It's right there on the desktop on the file marked "Kelly."

455
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,081
Okay, see you in the morning.

456
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:17,147
- Kelly Charles is a man.
- Kelly Charles is an animal.

457
00:30:17,557 --> 00:30:20,992
Kelly Charles is the reason I've been sleepwalking for the last week.

458
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:26,102
Davenport brought him in on the drone project to kick our asses and make some deadlines.

459
00:30:26,204 --> 00:30:28,525
- Him.
- Yes. Of course.

460
00:30:28,934 --> 00:30:30,081
Oh, my God.

461
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:33,030
Kelly wasn't the crisis.

462
00:30:33,507 --> 00:30:36,471
Me, taking the stand, you wanting me to lie.

463
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,535
This fight that we're having. This is the crisis.

464
00:30:38,616 --> 00:30:41,045
I have actually no idea what you're talking about. 

465
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,475
And ?further? I have no idea what you've decided. 


466
00:30:43,556 --> 00:30:45,609
Well, 'cause I don't know what I've decided,

467
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:50,070
except I'd really like you to be there. I mean, if Kelly would give you the time.

468
00:30:50,137 --> 00:30:54,878
'Cause I have to tell you, if I have to get up on the stand and perjure myself

469
00:30:54,965 --> 00:31:01,958
and lie to God and a judge, then I really want your ass sitting there in the front row when I do it.

470
00:31:05,829 --> 00:31:09,679
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

471
00:31:09,761 --> 00:31:10,642
I do.

472
00:31:17,812 --> 00:31:21,654
Mrs. Dubois, could you tell the court what you do for a living?

473
00:31:22,782 --> 00:31:26,402
I work for the District Attorney's office on a part-time basis here in Phoenix.

474
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:30,436
And what do you do for the District Attorney's office? Do you have a... a job title?

475
00:31:30,528 --> 00:31:33,391
- I'm a freelance consultant.
- A freelance consultant?

476
00:31:33,487 --> 00:31:35,177
Can you be more specific?

477
00:31:35,407 --> 00:31:37,974
I studied case law and criminal law in college.

478
00:31:38,075 --> 00:31:42,022
- So you're a legal consultant?
- Yes. I suppose you could say that.

479
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,043
And how long have youn at the D.A.'s office?

480
00:31:45,172 --> 00:31:48,392
Two months, although prior to that, I interned there.

481
00:31:48,484 --> 00:31:51,070
- And do you have a law degree?
- No, I do not.

482
00:31:51,172 --> 00:31:54,522
I see. Well, then, could you briefly walk us

483
00:31:54,572 --> 00:31:57,936
through what a typical workday would look like for you at the D.A.'s office?

484
00:31:58,054 --> 00:32:00,967
Objection, Your Honor. How in the world would an understanding

485
00:32:01,023 --> 00:32:04,136
of a typical workday for Mrs. Dubois contribute to this case?

486
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:07,122
Your Honor, the name, Allison Dubois, appears on a search warrant

487
00:32:07,183 --> 00:32:11,160
used to obtain crucial evidence in the prosecution of my client.

488
00:32:11,248 --> 00:32:13,903
Now, given that fact, the court has a right to know specifically 

489
00:32:14,008 --> 00:32:16,123
what Mrs. Dubois's involvement in this case is,

490
00:32:16,229 --> 00:32:19,865
and what her function was within the office of the District Attorney.

491
00:32:21,268 --> 00:32:24,944
Overruled. You may answer the question, Mrs. Dubois.

492
00:32:25,521 --> 00:32:31,338
On a typical day, I might interview a witness or witnesses involved in a possible crime.

493
00:32:31,452 --> 00:32:34,611
I might be asked to take statements from such witnesses.

494
00:32:34,983 --> 00:32:38,769
On occasion, I've been asked to monitor interrogation of suspects.

495
00:32:38,974 --> 00:32:41,794
You do all that for the District Attorney without a law degree?

496
00:32:44,303 --> 00:32:45,215
Wow.

497
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:50,549
- There must be something very special about you .
- My husband seems to think so.

498
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:58,899
This is the warrant ordering the exhumation of detective Pulaski's body .

499
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:02,990
Now, according to the information on line seven,

500
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:07,783
it was granted on the basis of an anonymous tip which you allegedly received.

501
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:09,898
- Am I correct?
- Yes.

502
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:13,686
What is not indicated anywhere on this warrant

503
00:33:14,081 --> 00:33:17,363
is how you received this anonymous tip.

504
00:33:18,177 --> 00:33:20,824
Did it come in the form of a phone call from this person?

505
00:33:22,124 --> 00:33:24,639
- No, it did not.
- No phone call.

506
00:33:25,457 --> 00:33:29,902
So, this... this anonymous tipster, did you meet him face-to-face?

507
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,748
Objection, Your Honor. Answering the question assumes a degree of specificity and,

508
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,553
as a result, compromises the anonymity of our source.

509
00:33:37,397 --> 00:33:40,495
Overruled. Please answer the question.

510
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:50,060
So once again, Mrs Dubois, are you testifying that you actually met this anonymous tipster face-to-face?

511
00:33:57,944 --> 00:33:59,040
Oh, yes.

512
00:33:59,521 --> 00:34:02,250
- You did?
- I certainly did.

513
00:34:02,946 --> 00:34:05,374
Now I am impressed.

514
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,978
You say you've worked for the District Attorney's office for how long?

515
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:11,287
- Two months.
- Two months.

516
00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:19,454
Not a very long time. But here you are, with an anonymous source seeking you out.

517
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:23,965
Contacting you instead of the lead detective involved in this case.

518
00:34:24,026 --> 00:34:27,113
Contacting you instead of the District Attorney.

519
00:34:27,221 --> 00:34:31,344
Contacting you instead of the Assistant District Attorney or the Assistant-Assistant,

520
00:34:31,426 --> 00:34:36,533
or the dozens of other law inforcement individuals involved in this case.

521
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,403
That's a hell of a story, Mrs. Dubois.

522
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:42,976
Your Honor, is Counsel asking questions of the witness or offering a summation to the jury?

523
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:46,799
- Mr Watt...
- My apologies your honor, it won't happen again.

524
00:34:47,813 --> 00:34:52,114
And with that in mind, I'm gonna ask you a simple direct question, Mrs. Dubois.

525
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:54,823
And remember, you're under oath. You swore to tell the truth.

526
00:34:54,895 --> 00:34:56,963
- What is it you're not telling us?
- Excuse me?

527
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:59,452
You're Honor, he's asking the witness to question herself!

528
00:34:59,548 --> 00:35:02,350
Mr. Watt, you'd better come to some kind of logical conclusion here.

529
00:35:02,427 --> 00:35:06,015
That's exactly what I'm trying to do, Your Honor. I'm trying to find the logic here.

530
00:35:06,082 --> 00:35:10,885
Now, the witness has testified that she's only worked for the district attorney's office for two months.

531
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:13,854
That she has no law degree, no real authority.

532
00:35:13,935 --> 00:35:18,856
And yet, someone with vitally important information sought her out.

533
00:35:18,995 --> 00:35:22,922
It doesn't seem logical. It doesn't make any sense.

534
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:26,403
- Unless...
- Unless what, Counsel?

535
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:31,866
Unless the witness enjoyed a special and privileged relationship

536
00:35:31,948 --> 00:35:34,637
with the informant that she's not sharing with the Court.

537
00:35:34,744 --> 00:35:36,457
- Objection.
- Overruled.

538
00:35:36,578 --> 00:35:39,940
Isn't that really what the situation is here, Mrs. Dubois?

539
00:35:40,044 --> 00:35:46,919
Did you enjoy a "special and privileged" relationship with this tipster that you're not sharing with the court?

540
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:49,657
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do.

541
00:35:49,822 --> 00:35:55,407
I think you know exactly what's so special about you that you were at that cemetery the other day.

542
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:59,756
I think you know exactly what's so special about you that the District Attorney

543
00:35:59,817 --> 00:36:03,365
keeps you around despite the fact that you have no law degree.

544
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:07,308
I think you know exactly what is so special about you

545
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:13,322
that this anonymous tipster sought you out over and above everyone else involved with this case.

546
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:16,549
And I think it goes to the very core of who you are

547
00:36:16,626 --> 00:36:20,337
and what you do for the District Attorney, doesn't it Mrs. Dubois. 


548
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,136
Objection. What is the question?

549
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:23,579
The question is...

550
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,453
"What makes you so special, Mrs. Dubois?

551
00:36:29,308 --> 00:36:32,002
"What do you really do for the District Attorney?

552
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,858
Who are you rea1ly, Mrs. Dubois?"

553
00:36:35,908 --> 00:36:38,996
Well, I'm not Adam Humphreys.

554
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,569
What did she just say?

555
00:36:42,686 --> 00:36:46,690
- She said, "I'm not Adam Humphreys."
- Who the hell is Adam Humphreys?

556
00:36:47,202 --> 00:36:50,576
- What did you just say?
- Adam Humphreys. He took your bar exam for you.

557
00:36:50,656 --> 00:36:53,367
- I can't hear them. Can you hear them?
- After you cheated, but still failed three times.

558
00:36:53,448 --> 00:36:56,225
- Counselor, I need you to take your hand off the microphone.
- And I'm not Dean Gardner.

559
00:36:56,307 --> 00:36:59,137
You bribed him to keep quiet in your last murder trial.

560
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,054
- And I'm not Shannon Leel.
- Objection, your honor, the defense is having

561
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,054
a private conversation with the witness. 

562
00:37:03,126 --> 00:37:06,629
- 'Cause you're cheating on your wife with her.
- Mr. Watt, remove your hand from the microphone

563
00:37:06,694 --> 00:37:08,728
- and back away from the witness, please.
- So now you know.

564
00:37:08,795 --> 00:37:12,280
- Do you really want to keep asking me who I am...
- Mr. Watt...

565
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:16,822
- ...at the risk of everyone finding out who you are?
- Don't make me get the bailiff to remove you.

566
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:19,608
Bailiff?

567
00:37:20,001 --> 00:37:22,587
Assist Defense Counsel back to his seat, please.

568
00:37:24,073 --> 00:37:24,896
Sir.

569
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,493
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

570
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:37,538
Will the court reporter please read back the last question from Counsel?

571
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:41,521
"The question is, 'What makes you so special, Mrs. Dubois?

572
00:37:41,608 --> 00:37:46,467
What do you really do for the District Attorney? Who are you really, Mrs. Dubois?'"

573
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,294
I'm just a part-time consultant trying to do her job.

574
00:38:00,087 --> 00:38:01,868
No further questions, Your Honor.

575
00:38:04,372 --> 00:38:07,840
We reserve the right to recall this witness at another time.

576
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,831
Thanks.

577
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:26,080
Negative.

578
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,836
The biopsy was negative.

579
00:38:32,963 --> 00:38:37,688
Boy, for someone who just dodged a major bullet, you seem a little down.

580
00:38:38,077 --> 00:38:41,046
What is it, it's all over now, you maybe a little disappointed?

581
00:38:41,343 --> 00:38:42,234
About what?

582
00:38:42,352 --> 00:38:45,450
I don't know, not being able to get up there and declare who you are, what you do?

583
00:38:46,694 --> 00:38:48,143
No, I don't think so.

584
00:38:48,865 --> 00:38:51,758
I fear that day is coming no matter what we do.

585
00:38:52,178 --> 00:38:54,026
It's a tough secret to keep.

586
00:38:56,429 --> 00:38:58,502
I'll call the baby-sitter just to check in.

587
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:03,186
What is it? Something's still eating at you. I can feel it.

588
00:39:03,457 --> 00:39:05,624
It's nothing. It's probably nothing.

589
00:39:05,746 --> 00:39:09,360
You know me, every day is cloudy, every dream's a nightmare.

590
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,122
I'm sure it's nothing.

591
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:16,610
I need more wine.

592
00:39:17,007 --> 00:39:19,391
Hello? Can we get another glass here?

593
00:39:25,038 --> 00:39:26,355
Oh my god.

594
00:39:36,717 --> 00:39:38,496
- She's choking.
- Somebody!

595
00:39:56,152 --> 00:39:58,283
- You okay?
- Yeah.

596
00:39:59,183 --> 00:40:00,521
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

597
00:40:00,628 --> 00:40:01,954
Can't believe it actually works.

598
00:40:02,594 --> 00:40:03,756
Sit down, sit down.

599
00:40:04,296 --> 00:40:05,427
Glass water?

600
00:40:06,128 --> 00:40:07,991
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

601
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:19,224
All in a day's work.

602
00:40:21,584 --> 00:40:22,782
What are you smiling at?

603
00:40:24,645 --> 00:40:27,093
The sun just came up, that's all.

604
