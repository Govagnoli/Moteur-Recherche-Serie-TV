1
00:00:07,214 --> 00:00:08,174
He just left.

2
00:00:08,482 --> 00:00:09,623
Just had his methadone.

3
00:00:10,335 --> 00:00:12,634
Dark hair, five-11, medium build.

4
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:15,142
Now, how do I get my money?

5
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:15,555
What's he saying? What's he screaming about?

6
00:01:15,626 --> 00:01:17,971
What do you think he's saying? He wants to know what we're up to.

7
00:01:20,727 --> 00:01:21,919
You want to know what we're up to?

8
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,634
We're gonna help you kick.

9
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:25,532
Gonna help you clean up.

10
00:01:42,634 --> 00:01:43,612
¿Acabastes?

11
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:48,347
¿Acabastes? It's Spanish.

12
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:51,328
It means, "Are you done?" "Are you through?"

13
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:54,973
You don't know what "Acabastes" means?

14
00:01:56,745 --> 00:02:00,638
Oh, that's funny, 'cause you've been raving in Spanish for the last ten minutes.

15
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:02,670
Really?

16
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,055
Well, I don't know what to tell you. I was dreaming, Joe.

17
00:02:08,516 --> 00:02:09,366
Yeah.

18
00:02:10,016 --> 00:02:11,962
But if you don't speak Spanish...

19
00:02:13,345 --> 00:02:16,120
I mean, what, your dreams are subtitled?

20
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:20,759
Sorry I asked.

21
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:12,661
And then after school, we can start the model at my house?

22
00:03:12,763 --> 00:03:14,268
Tell him you love him.

23
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:18,454
That's it! As soon as I get off the phone, I'm going to kill you!

24
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:21,549
You look scary. You look like a killer sister.

25
00:03:21,814 --> 00:03:24,984
Yeah? No, that's just my little sister.

26
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:26,792
Say, "I love you, Sean."

27
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,172
I've been talking to my parents about maybe trading her in and getting a dog.

28
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:31,164
Good morning.

29
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:34,288
Dad? Are you trading me in for a dog?

30
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:35,425
Hm?

31
00:03:36,524 --> 00:03:37,400
Ariel.

32
00:03:37,515 --> 00:03:38,727
I'm on the phone.

33
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:40,344
I'm asking Mom.

34
00:03:40,528 --> 00:03:41,625
She'll know!

35
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:43,821
It's ten after 7:00. Who are you calling?

36
00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:46,355
Okay, um, I'll see you in class.

37
00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:47,307
Bye.

38
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:48,885
Who was that?

39
00:03:49,335 --> 00:03:50,481
Sean Bertoni.

40
00:03:51,082 --> 00:03:53,928
He's my, uh, partner for the science fair project.

41
00:03:54,036 --> 00:03:55,542
And her boyfriend!

42
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:59,749
He's coming over after school so we can start working together.

43
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,216
Science fair, huh? What kind of project are you guys thinking about doing?

44
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:07,558
Actually, we're thinking of doing something with rockets.

45
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:09,529
Rockets! I like it.

46
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:10,993
It was Sean's idea.

47
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:13,596
Hmm, well, then I think I like Sean Bertoni.

48
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:17,588
Dad, Mommy's missing! I can't find her anywhere!

49
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,974
No, she's fine.

50
00:04:19,155 --> 00:04:20,951
Stop yelling. You'll wake your sister.

51
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,600
But, Dad...

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,767
I can't find her, and if I can't find her, how are we apposed to get to school?

53
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,346
I'm gonna take you to school. Mom had to go into work early.

54
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,494
Something came up, something very special came up, and Mom had to go into work extra early.

55
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:37,253
The lucky stiff.

56
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:43,470
And that one's for Mrs. Dubois, courtesy of the Mayor's Office.

57
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:46,096
All we ask is that you avoid any contact with the press.

58
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:50,080
If you do get buttonholed by someone, just please, steer them over to me.

59
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,150
Have you ever attended one of these before?

60
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:55,706
State execution? No.

61
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:56,792
It was my idea--

62
00:04:56,955 --> 00:05:02,179
Mrs. Dubois has been doing a lot of work as a jury consultant for my office in capital punishment cases,

63
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,875
and I thought if she was gonna have a hand in ending someone's life,

64
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:08,149
it was important that she see, um...

65
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:09,808
The end result?

66
00:05:10,196 --> 00:05:12,147
I'll be curious to see what you think.

67
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:18,040
For me, the event itself is... always surprisingly matter-of-fact.

68
00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:23,483
And then the memory of it, it stays with you for the rest of your life.

69
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:35,961
I have to say, I'm impressed you're going through with this.

70
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:40,334
You might want to hold that thought till after in case I pass out or throw up or something.

71
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,556
You wouldn't be the first.

72
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,657
Just keep in mind, people like Reynaldo Cerrera are the reason the death penalty exists.

73
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:48,501
I prosecuted the man myself.

74
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:52,858
Guilty of four counts of murder, including the shooting death of a seven-year-old girl,

75
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:57,296
who happened to be walking down the street during a drive-by attack by a rival drug gang.

76
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:00,286
And the four counts are just what I could link to him directly.

77
00:06:00,502 --> 00:06:02,786
God knows how many other murders he ordered.

78
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:05,550
Or how many people died because of the junk he was peddling.

79
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:11,878
Everyone's entitled to their opinion, of course, but if you ask me, lethal injection

80
00:06:11,986 --> 00:06:15,943
is too gentle, too civilized an ending for an animal like Cerrera.

81
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:20,864
That's funny.

82
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:21,694
What's that?

83
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:25,135
Don't you usually call in the coroner when there's a question about the cause of death?

84
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:27,366
Seems today would be a foregone conclusion.

85
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,956
Well, they're not really coroners, they're the drivers.

86
00:06:31,032 --> 00:06:34,570
They're here to transport the remains to the Medical Examiner's Office.

87
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:38,847
State requires that we do an autopsy before we hand over the body to the family.

88
00:06:39,347 --> 00:06:41,042
We're nothing if not thorough.

89
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:47,263
He looks so calm.

90
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:50,284
They're given a sedative.

91
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:54,272
Reynaldo Cerrera, do you have any final words?

92
00:06:55,568 --> 00:06:57,308
No final ones.

93
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,152
No.

94
00:07:58,205 --> 00:07:59,036
So?

95
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:01,539
So that woman from the Mayor's Office was right.

96
00:08:02,102 --> 00:08:05,205
It's odd. It was weirdly undramatic.

97
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:08,001
I'm more surprised by what I didn't feel.

98
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,001
He was a very bad man.

99
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,101
It sounds harsh, but I don't think a life of any value was lost here today.

100
00:08:16,393 --> 00:08:19,075
You must be right-- he must have been empty, soulless.

101
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:20,386
At least I couldn't see it.

102
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,690
What do you mean?

103
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:26,207
I've never been to an execution before, but normally,

104
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:29,531
when I go to a funeral or if someone passes in the hospital,

105
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:32,577
I see their soul, I see their spirit.

106
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,293
But today...

107
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,146
there was nothing.

108
00:08:37,236 --> 00:08:38,491
He must've had none.

109
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,573
Well, it's time to rejoin the living.

110
00:08:45,053 --> 00:08:47,174
Oh, which reminds me, when we get back to the office,

111
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:50,006
could I look through the current missing- persons reports?

112
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:51,219
Why, you lose somebody?

113
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,448
Well, this is gonna shock and amaze you, but last night I had the craziest dream.

114
00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:58,085
You? How is that possible?

115
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,735
What the hell?

116
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:05,892
Oh, God, it's 3:00 in the morning.

117
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,562
Hello?

118
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,544
Allison, it's Lee Scanlon.

119
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,014
I'm sorry to call so late.

120
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,431
I'm at a murder scene, and, uh...

121
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:23,096
I was wondering if I could send a car to bring you downtown?

122
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:25,584
Detective Scanlon, it's the middle of the night.

123
00:09:26,037 --> 00:09:27,049
Yeah, I know.

124
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:29,906
Normally I wouldn't bother you, but...

125
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:35,129
I got a dead woman, and I got a witness, and the witness says he knows who did it.

126
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:39,122
And I couldn't think of anyone else who might be able to make sense of what he's saying.

127
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:42,389
I'm sorry. I don't understand. What are you talking about?

128
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:48,093
Well... the witness is telling me the killer was a ghost.

129
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:55,086
Can you state your name, please?

130
00:09:55,557 --> 00:09:57,411
Why are we taping this, and who's she?

131
00:09:57,944 --> 00:10:01,142
The agreement I made with your attorney was that I would defer making a decision

132
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,909
on whether or not to book you until you made an on-the-record statement

133
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:05,229
of your version of what happened.

134
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:06,668
She's not a shrink, is she?

135
00:10:06,955 --> 00:10:08,758
She's with the District Attorney's office.

136
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:11,364
They have to weigh in whether to charge you, as well.

137
00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:14,557
Well, what difference does it make?

138
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:17,853
- I'm a dead man, right?
- Mr. Ramirez, please.

139
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:20,973
I'm trying to help you here. I'm trying to keep you out of jail.

140
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:22,392
What difference does it make?

141
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:24,849
He'll just kill me in jail.

142
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,954
He'll find me wherever I am, right?

143
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,520
Mr. Ramirez, are you aware that right now

144
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:34,286
you are the primary suspect in the murder of Lorena Vasquez?

145
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:38,273
And until I have your statement to evaluate, you will remain the primary suspect?

146
00:10:42,856 --> 00:10:44,101
Let's start with your name, please.

147
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:51,545
My name is Steven Ramirez.

148
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:53,169
You want to tell us what you do for a living?

149
00:10:57,975 --> 00:10:59,241
I'm a businessman.

150
00:11:00,218 --> 00:11:01,355
An entrepreneur.

151
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,569
Would it be fair to say that you're involved in many of the same businesses as Rey Cerrera?

152
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,494
Rey Cerrera was an animal.

153
00:11:09,142 --> 00:11:10,412
Is an animal.

154
00:11:10,864 --> 00:11:12,665
I own a legitimate business.

155
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,142
I'm involved in facilitating imports and exports.

156
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:18,763
Obviously, we...

157
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,603
we had a number of enterprises that competed for the same market share.

158
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:29,177
Now... according to this report, police responded to shots being fired at the former home

159
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,752
of your business rival, the late Rey Cerrera, and found you attempting to flee the scene.

160
00:11:33,714 --> 00:11:37,144
They also discovered the body of Lorena Vasquez,

161
00:11:37,247 --> 00:11:38,758
a woman thought to be Cerrera's girlfriend.

162
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:42,187
I'm guessing she's another area where you and Rey "competed"?

163
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:46,677
She loved me.

164
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:50,109
And I loved her.

165
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,447
And I guess...

166
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,252
I guess he wasn't ready to give her up.

167
00:11:59,955 --> 00:12:01,209
And now he doesn't have to.

168
00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:07,292
All right, let's start from the beginning.

169
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,198
You and Lorena were in the hot tub. I'm guessing from all the champagne bottles we found

170
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:12,735
that you were celebrating.

171
00:12:15,781 --> 00:12:16,810
Rey was dead.

172
00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:21,074
It was the beginning of a new day for us.

173
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:25,938
And we were out there, in the hot tub.

174
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,798
It was a beautiful night.

175
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:29,353
It was perfect.

176
00:12:29,774 --> 00:12:30,840
She was so happy.

177
00:12:31,423 --> 00:12:33,256
She said she wanted some more champagne...

178
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,177
My God.

179
00:12:39,148 --> 00:12:40,316
She was so beautiful.

180
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:53,255
And then I heard it.

181
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:54,703
First the scream...

182
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:57,131
And then the crash.

183
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:01,032
And then I saw someone.

184
00:13:02,301 --> 00:13:03,970
I saw someone inside the house.

185
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:07,969
And this, this, this didn't make any sense.

186
00:13:08,026 --> 00:13:11,353
And this house, I mean, it... it's built like a fort, right?

187
00:13:12,096 --> 00:13:13,955
Then I felt his presence.

188
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:18,102
I looked up, and that's when I saw him, Rey Cerrera.

189
00:13:18,178 --> 00:13:20,908
I started firing, and I just kept on firing.

190
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:23,821
And he was gone.

191
00:13:26,924 --> 00:13:28,813
He came back from the dead to kill her.

192
00:13:29,797 --> 00:13:31,317
And now that he knows about us,

193
00:13:32,705 --> 00:13:34,225
he'll come back again...

194
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:36,447
to kill me.

195
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:49,564
Oh, boy, school! Yay!

196
00:13:49,652 --> 00:13:51,090
Oh, my goodness, here comes Sean!

197
00:13:51,274 --> 00:13:53,470
Hey, maybe he's going to propose!

198
00:13:53,557 --> 00:13:54,802
Bridgette! Shh.

199
00:13:55,705 --> 00:13:56,902
Hi, Sean!

200
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:58,669
Hey, Ariel. Hey, Bridgette.

201
00:13:59,093 --> 00:14:00,747
I finished the nose cone last night.

202
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,210
Wow. That looks great.

203
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,757
Sean, this is my mother.

204
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:08,816
Hi, Sean. Nice to meet you.

205
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:13,054
Mommy? Mommy, why?

206
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:15,953
It's nice to meet you, too.

207
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:19,732
I was just filled with this sense of dread.

208
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,826
It just became so clear to me.

209
00:14:22,348 --> 00:14:23,845
He's gonna do something.

210
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:26,556
He's gonna hurt her, he just is.

211
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:28,532
We're talking about a ten-year-old boy here.

212
00:14:28,604 --> 00:14:31,258
I mean, they're working on a science fair project together,

213
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:33,392
not going to Florida for spring break.

214
00:14:33,576 --> 00:14:34,790
How can he possibly hurt her?

215
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:37,815
I don't know. I'm just telling you what I saw, I'm just...

216
00:14:38,318 --> 00:14:39,843
I'm telling you what I felt.

217
00:14:40,074 --> 00:14:42,869
Well, I think you've got to be a little suspicious about anything you might be feeling

218
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:46,131
after watching a man being put to death and then staying out half the night.

219
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:48,195
And what are you doing on the phone?

220
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:50,059
Aren't you supposed to be at home, catching a nap?

221
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:52,255
I tried. I couldn't sleep.

222
00:14:53,488 --> 00:14:56,786
I just... felt I needed to tell you.

223
00:14:57,768 --> 00:15:00,507
Can you hold on a second? I'm getting another call.

224
00:15:01,854 --> 00:15:02,636
Hello?

225
00:15:02,724 --> 00:15:05,173
Allison? The District Attorney asked me to call

226
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:08,104
to see if you could meet him at the courthouse in about an hour.

227
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:09,213
An hour?

228
00:15:10,107 --> 00:15:10,968
Yeah, sure.

229
00:15:11,147 --> 00:15:12,349
They got coffee there?

230
00:15:13,794 --> 00:15:14,567
Manuel!

231
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:16,974
Thanks for coming here.

232
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:20,430
I would have happily come to your place, but I'm locked into a trial and...

233
00:15:20,506 --> 00:15:23,497
You're a busy man, Larry. We get it. Now what are we doing here?

234
00:15:23,644 --> 00:15:27,731
Well, something's come up with regard to the Ramirez case,

235
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,572
the death of that poor Lorena Vasquez that I wanted to share with you,

236
00:15:30,634 --> 00:15:33,045
in private, as a professional courtesy.

237
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,278
You are familiar with the case?

238
00:15:35,814 --> 00:15:40,829
You mean the one in which your client, a notorious drug lord, was found at the scene of a murder

239
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:44,833
and claimed with an absolute straight face that it was actually committed by a man

240
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:48,329
that both Mrs. Dubois and I watched being put to death earlier in the day?

241
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:50,049
Vaguely.

242
00:15:50,444 --> 00:15:51,166
Good.

243
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:54,344
Now, if you read my client's statement, you would have taken note of the fact

244
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,974
that he snapped a picture with his phone of the late Ms. Vasquez's, um...

245
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,812
behind only a minute or so before Rey Cerrera killed her?

246
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,806
Oh, yes.

247
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:06,941
I was nearly brought to tears as I read about it.

248
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:09,706
Clearly, your client is quite the romantic.

249
00:16:09,777 --> 00:16:12,706
Now, well, what he failed to mention was that he sent that picture

250
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:15,067
via cell phone to a business associate.

251
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:15,865
Of course he did.

252
00:16:15,952 --> 00:16:18,303
And I wanted to make you aware of the fact that I'm planning

253
00:16:18,349 --> 00:16:22,117
on introducing Mr. Ramirez's cell phone records to establish the date and time

254
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:24,903
of the photo's creation as well as its transmission.

255
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:28,614
Are you trying to tell me that a photo your client took of this woman's...

256
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:31,753
tush is somehow gonna convince me not to file charges?

257
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,239
That's exactly what I'm telling you.

258
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:37,161
By the way, I'm glad you're involved with this case, Mrs. Dubois,

259
00:16:37,226 --> 00:16:39,642
because I believe that your expertise in this area

260
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,648
is going to prove most helpful to the District Attorney.

261
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:50,025
Go ahead, take a look.

262
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:54,374
It looks like a photo from Rumpshaker that didn't make the cut.

263
00:16:54,465 --> 00:16:55,484
Look closer.

264
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:56,990
In the background.

265
00:17:02,244 --> 00:17:03,667
All right, what's that?

266
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:05,505
Don't you mean who's that?

267
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,817
I took the liberty of having the photo enhanced.

268
00:17:09,139 --> 00:17:10,056
Blown up.

269
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,419
Cleaned up.

270
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,132
Take a look.

271
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,960
This man is dead.

272
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,889
And I can personally attest to the fact that he had been dead

273
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,140
at least 12 hours before this woman was murdered.

274
00:17:24,218 --> 00:17:25,381
Pictures don't lie, Manny.

275
00:17:25,463 --> 00:17:28,641
No, but people do all the time, and they've even been known to use pictures to do it.

276
00:17:28,703 --> 00:17:30,127
This has been doctored.

277
00:17:31,003 --> 00:17:33,264
It's obviously doctored. It proves nothing.

278
00:17:33,557 --> 00:17:36,592
Why don't you let your techs look at it, see what they have to say?

279
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:39,400
In fact, why don't you send it to the FBI?

280
00:17:39,497 --> 00:17:40,362
We will.

281
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,631
Go ahead, tell him it's not a fake.

282
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:47,305
I don't know that.

283
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:48,431
Really?

284
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:50,992
Well, then, you disappoint me, Mrs. Dubois.

285
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:53,706
By the way, one piece of bad news:

286
00:17:53,796 --> 00:17:57,499
Somehow a copy of this photo got leaked to the press.

287
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:00,012
Those damn vultures.

288
00:18:01,985 --> 00:18:06,105
Manuel, I'm going to let you take some time to mull things over.

289
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:10,017
Unfortunately, I need these back.

290
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,816
But don't worry, if you want to see them,

291
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,042
you can just check 'em out on the front page of the paper.

292
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,012
Little boy, remember I told you I was gonna offer your mother a choice?

293
00:18:38,106 --> 00:18:40,649
And that if she made the one choice, it would be good for you,

294
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,429
and if she made the other choice it would be bad for you?

295
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:46,872
Well, I'm sorry to say, she made the wrong choice.

296
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,902
So, now, we have to change her thinking.

297
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,384
Now, this nice man is gonna hold you.

298
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,956
Now, don't get upset.

299
00:18:55,057 --> 00:18:57,578
I'm not making this happen. Your mother is making this happen.

300
00:18:58,462 --> 00:18:59,784
- Come on.
- No!

301
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,575
This will only hurt for a little while.

302
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:04,770
Besides, who needs a pinky anyway?

303
00:19:04,837 --> 00:19:05,862
What are they good for?

304
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,431
- Let's count to three.
- No!

305
00:19:07,472 --> 00:19:09,215
One... Two...

306
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,714
And his mom is so cool. She camps!

307
00:19:20,802 --> 00:19:23,612
He says they've been camping all of their lives, and she said that maybe

308
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:25,967
the next time they go on a camping trip, our families could go, too!

309
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:27,657
Wouldn't that be amazing?

310
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:29,251
What do you mean?

311
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:30,940
Sleep on the ground?

312
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:32,250
On the dirt?

313
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:36,644
Ariel, I think I need to talk to you about something.

314
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:40,115
Uh, Al, I think I need to talk to you about something first.

315
00:19:42,655 --> 00:19:46,223
Okay. You had a dream the other night about a guy being kidnapped, right?

316
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:46,637
Joe...

317
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:48,749
Ah, you went into work, no one was missing.

318
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:49,320
Joe...

319
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:50,969
Ah. I'm trying to make a point here.

320
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:52,848
Any dreams last night?

321
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,978
Actually, yes, there was a little boy...

322
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:56,150
What, murdered, kidnapped?

323
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:57,921
Kidnapped, I think.

324
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:01,332
Funny, 'cause I didn't hear a word about a missing kid on TV just now.

325
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:02,980
Listen, well, maybe...

326
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:04,655
Uh, maybe it hasn't happened yet, maybe...

327
00:20:04,726 --> 00:20:08,413
maybe the kid is just a symbol for something, and maybe... just maybe you're wrong.

328
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,596
And maybe... just maybe you're wrong about this Sean kid, too.

329
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,775
I saw your face out there. You're convinced this is going to end badly for Ariel,

330
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:18,217
and you're convinced that you have to do something about it.

331
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:19,837
So now you're reading my mind?

332
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:23,046
Uh, no, Allison. Actually, I'm pleading with you. Just leave it alone.

333
00:20:23,124 --> 00:20:23,947
Well, if I know...

334
00:20:24,028 --> 00:20:26,850
But you don't know. You don't know that she isn't going to break his heart.

335
00:20:27,362 --> 00:20:30,041
You don't know that they're not going to win the science fair and have a friendship

336
00:20:30,087 --> 00:20:32,815
that lasts the rest of their lives. You don't know that this boy

337
00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:35,932
and whatever joy-- and yes, maybe pain-- he brings,

338
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,878
is going to contribute in some really important way to making Ariel

339
00:20:38,928 --> 00:20:40,291
who she's supposed to become.

340
00:20:46,015 --> 00:20:47,484
What are you guys doing?

341
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:48,918
We're talking.

342
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,642
Who's on the phone?

343
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:53,336
It's, uh, Sean's mom. She called for you.

344
00:20:57,392 --> 00:20:58,148
Hello?

345
00:20:59,657 --> 00:21:01,338
Nice to meet you, too.

346
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,424
Coffee? After we take the kids to school?

347
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,326
Sure. Sounds great.

348
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:11,728
Ariel's a terrific kid.

349
00:21:11,815 --> 00:21:13,385
Sean's really taken with her.

350
00:21:13,796 --> 00:21:16,269
I haven't had a chance to spend any real time with him,

351
00:21:16,336 --> 00:21:19,633
but my husband wants to adopt him and my daughter wants to marry him,

352
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,399
so there you have it.

353
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:23,447
I'm just happy Sean's made a friend.

354
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:25,249
We move around a lot.

355
00:21:25,336 --> 00:21:26,809
Mostly because of my job.

356
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:29,340
And it's not always easy for him.

357
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,815
Well, who knows, maybe this time you'll be able to stick around for a while.

358
00:21:37,101 --> 00:21:38,829
Oh, my God. What is this?

359
00:21:46,693 --> 00:21:47,706
Are you all right?

360
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:54,423
- Yes, Officer?
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

361
00:21:54,602 --> 00:21:56,553
May I please see your license and registration?

362
00:21:58,121 --> 00:22:02,113
Everything's all right, Officer? I wasn't breaking any laws?

363
00:22:02,216 --> 00:22:03,363
Broken tail light.

364
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:08,677
Be back in a moment.

365
00:22:14,322 --> 00:22:16,639
License and registration, please?

366
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:31,564
Thanks, Melissa.

367
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:36,608
You two wouldn't happen to have been anywhere near Hollister today, would you?

368
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:38,277
I don't even know where that is.

369
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,395
Had a robbery in a pharmacy over there.

370
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:43,822
You wouldn't know anything about that now, would you?

371
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:45,526
No, sir.

372
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,938
That your boyfriend there?

373
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:52,596
You want to wake him up?

374
00:22:53,704 --> 00:22:55,039
Not sure I can.

375
00:22:56,013 --> 00:22:57,252
Pretty trashed, huh?

376
00:22:59,848 --> 00:23:01,306
God, you're good looking.

377
00:23:07,896 --> 00:23:09,734
Stay right there.

378
00:23:10,825 --> 00:23:12,232
I'll be back in a moment.

379
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:24,127
Wake up! Wake... up!

380
00:23:41,226 --> 00:23:43,439
Oh, my goodness.

381
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:47,593
We have a problem, Melissa. Big problem.

382
00:23:48,268 --> 00:23:51,167
Seems this car comes fairly close to matching

383
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:54,997
the description of the vehicle used in that robbery in Hollister.

384
00:23:55,949 --> 00:23:59,533
Now I explained to them that I had just interviewed you,

385
00:23:59,911 --> 00:24:04,416
and I convinced them to give me sole discretion on whether or not to detain you.

386
00:24:05,498 --> 00:24:08,262
But I am going to need you to step out of the car.

387
00:24:14,321 --> 00:24:20,305
Melissa, I'm gonna need you to turn around and put your hands on top of the vehicle.

388
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:28,598
What are you doing?

389
00:24:30,505 --> 00:24:32,091
This is called a pat down.

390
00:24:33,177 --> 00:24:34,763
What's the matter? My hands cold?

391
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:39,847
Do me a favor.

392
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:43,421
Just bend over a little more.

393
00:24:43,555 --> 00:24:45,126
Can you do that for me, please?

394
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:02,729
Oh, my God, what is that?

395
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,437
What do you think it is?

396
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:12,360
Don't pretend that you've never had one of those back there before.

397
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:15,571
Listen, I'm eight weeks pregnant.

398
00:25:17,496 --> 00:25:21,596
All the more reason for me to conduct this investigation from behind.

399
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:34,079
Now... how about you undo your jeans?

400
00:25:50,026 --> 00:25:51,047
My God.

401
00:25:51,202 --> 00:25:52,880
Now give me my keys.

402
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:56,506
Take it easy.

403
00:26:05,285 --> 00:26:06,264
Let it go, girl!

404
00:26:12,491 --> 00:26:16,105
Sarah, you have a spotless record, so I'm gonna let you go with a warning.

405
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,404
But let's get that light fixed pronto, okay?

406
00:26:18,481 --> 00:26:20,005
Absolutely. Thank you.

407
00:26:37,838 --> 00:26:38,842
I need to see him.

408
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,246
Now is not a good time.

409
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:43,988
Good morning.

410
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,033
Says you.

411
00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:55,370
Did I ask you to come in today?

412
00:26:55,776 --> 00:26:56,614
No. I...

413
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:57,761
You happen to see the morning paper?

414
00:26:58,627 --> 00:27:03,147
No. My daughter's friend's mother called and that's what I'm here to talk to you about.

415
00:27:04,197 --> 00:27:05,922
Catchy headline, don't you think?

416
00:27:06,911 --> 00:27:09,874
The Mayor's Office and the police department are being flooded with calls.

417
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:14,457
People are suddenly claiming to have seen the ghost of Reynaldo Cerrera all over town...

418
00:27:14,642 --> 00:27:16,874
riding in cabs, eating in restaurants,

419
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,613
power walking in the mall.

420
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:21,749
You didn't happen to see him on the way over, did you?

421
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,667
Well, let me ask you a crude question.

422
00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:26,797
If all these other people are seeing him, why aren't you?

423
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,429
I don't see people just because they're dead.

424
00:27:29,501 --> 00:27:30,740
They have to seek me out.

425
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,525
The only other time it happens is if I'm at a funeral

426
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,807
or if I'm at the grave site and the spirit happens to be there.

427
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,932
Would you like me to visit Cerrera's grave?

428
00:27:39,153 --> 00:27:41,348
Doesn't exist. Family cremated him.

429
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:46,203
Any way I could go back into the prison?

430
00:27:46,284 --> 00:27:47,478
On the other side of the glass?

431
00:27:47,544 --> 00:27:49,013
Where he was actually executed?

432
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:50,617
Maybe I could get something there.

433
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:52,035
Let me make a call.

434
00:28:26,968 --> 00:28:27,776
Hey.

435
00:28:29,856 --> 00:28:31,970
That's a cool yo-yo you got there.

436
00:28:42,466 --> 00:28:44,293
So what happened to your finger?

437
00:28:45,873 --> 00:28:46,798
Can I help you?

438
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:53,633
I didn't speak to her, Mom.

439
00:28:53,756 --> 00:28:55,769
I didn't speak to the stranger.

440
00:28:55,865 --> 00:28:57,073
I know. Go inside.

441
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:00,618
Can I help you?

442
00:29:00,894 --> 00:29:01,862
That's okay.

443
00:29:03,556 --> 00:29:06,531
Just trying to find my way out of this maze.

444
00:29:29,364 --> 00:29:30,647
What's he yammering about?

445
00:29:30,744 --> 00:29:32,842
Food. He wants food.

446
00:29:32,946 --> 00:29:35,013
Tell him no. There's no food.

447
00:29:35,152 --> 00:29:37,456
We can't feed him 'til we know what Cerrera had to eat.

448
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:38,750
Tell him to show me the tattoo.

449
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:45,152
It's healing very nice.

450
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:46,944
You have very good taste.

451
00:29:57,757 --> 00:29:58,888
Buenas noches.

452
00:29:59,904 --> 00:30:02,083
You were doing it again. The Spanish thing.

453
00:30:02,186 --> 00:30:03,769
I'm sorry. I was dreaming.

454
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:05,986
Me, too. You were Salma Hayek.

455
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:10,112
Please, Joe, this is serious.

456
00:30:11,116 --> 00:30:12,610
I saw that guy again.

457
00:30:12,831 --> 00:30:14,178
The one that was kidnapped?

458
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:16,353
They were giving him Cerrera's tattoos,

459
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:19,241
making him eat what Cerrera ate.

460
00:30:19,337 --> 00:30:26,117
It was... it was as if they were getting him ready to be Cerrera.

461
00:30:27,381 --> 00:30:30,515
You know what you need? You need to talk to Cerrera's ghost.

462
00:30:31,606 --> 00:30:34,662
That'd be nice, but he's not talking.

463
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:41,636
And what do I do about Ariel's friend?

464
00:30:41,989 --> 00:30:44,362
I don't know that there's anything to do.

465
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:47,622
His mother killed a cop.

466
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,098
A bad cop, but the fact is, she killed him.

467
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:55,183
No wonder she's such a good camper.

468
00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:58,491
No wonder she's always moving them from town to town.

469
00:31:00,764 --> 00:31:02,996
I hate that I know this.

470
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:06,170
I hate that I have to do something about this.

471
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:08,282
Well, as long as we're talking about hates...

472
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:11,036
I hate that I have to remind you that you don't know this, you think it.

473
00:31:11,491 --> 00:31:14,148
Until you know it, you don't have to do anything about it.

474
00:31:14,363 --> 00:31:15,930
In fact, you probably shouldn't.

475
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,944
Can I make a suggestion?

476
00:31:20,072 --> 00:31:22,049
You talking to me or you talking to Salma?

477
00:31:22,596 --> 00:31:26,128
Before you go to the authorities and turn this woman's life upside down,

478
00:31:26,836 --> 00:31:30,368
not to mention destroy a friendship that's pretty damn important to your daughter,

479
00:31:31,013 --> 00:31:35,034
isn't there some subtle way that you could broach the subject with the woman herself?

480
00:31:35,442 --> 00:31:38,924
Just test her reaction before you go running to the D.A.

481
00:31:43,886 --> 00:31:44,905
I suppose so.

482
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,300
Melissa!

483
00:31:49,777 --> 00:31:51,286
Melissa Banks?

484
00:31:52,747 --> 00:31:54,679
That's your real name, isn't it?

485
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,531
I'm sorry to ambush you like this,

486
00:31:57,761 --> 00:31:59,277
but we have a problem.

487
00:31:59,738 --> 00:32:01,741
I know who you really are.

488
00:32:01,964 --> 00:32:03,614
I know what you've done.

489
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:06,604
And I work for the District Attorney's office.

490
00:32:09,742 --> 00:32:12,661
It might actually be a blessing, you know...

491
00:32:13,408 --> 00:32:16,084
not having to move around, getting it all out...

492
00:32:16,884 --> 00:32:18,098
going to trial.

493
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,055
I'm betting that when people hear your side of the story...

494
00:32:40,566 --> 00:32:41,103
Yeah?

495
00:32:42,522 --> 00:32:43,565
Yeah, put her through.

496
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:44,974
Yes, Allison?

497
00:32:45,102 --> 00:32:46,905
I need to discuss something with you.

498
00:32:47,053 --> 00:32:49,510
It's about a crime that happened over a decade ago.

499
00:32:49,572 --> 00:32:52,755
Well, if it held for a decade, it's just going to have to hold a little while longer.

500
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:55,538
If it's not about the Cerrera case, I don't want to hear it.

501
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:58,009
I just got the DNA back from the murder scene.

502
00:32:58,773 --> 00:33:03,427
The skin under Lorena Vasquez's nails, the tiny remnants of saliva on her neck,

503
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,122
the stray hairs on her body...

504
00:33:05,706 --> 00:33:09,224
they all belong to the late Reynaldo Cerrera.

505
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,304
Did you ever heard of that? A ghost leaving DNA behind?

506
00:33:12,392 --> 00:33:14,118
No, I can't say I have.

507
00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:17,011
I think I'm going to have to withdraw the charges against Ramirez.

508
00:33:17,383 --> 00:33:20,277
The only question is, who do I file them against, a dead man?

509
00:33:20,358 --> 00:33:23,103
I'm sorry. I feel like I've really let you down on this one.

510
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,675
Well, it's not you.

511
00:33:25,176 --> 00:33:29,653
Something crazy happened at that house that night, and maybe we'll never really know what.

512
00:33:29,847 --> 00:33:32,641
Listen, would it be possible for me to go out there?

513
00:33:33,006 --> 00:33:35,637
Well... it's a crime scene.

514
00:33:35,718 --> 00:33:38,735
I'm sure the police are still there. Just mention that you're with my office.

515
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:39,912
Why? What are you thinking?

516
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:42,720
I don't know. It seems like everyone's running into that ghost but me.

517
00:33:42,796 --> 00:33:44,818
Maybe it's time I made a house call.

518
00:33:45,586 --> 00:33:47,618
You, uh, looking for anything specific?

519
00:33:47,832 --> 00:33:51,612
No. Just helpful to see where it all happened, soak it in.

520
00:34:16,007 --> 00:34:17,017
Excuse me.

521
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,521
Do you mind if I use this phone?

522
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:22,568
You think it's okay to use this phone?

523
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,170
Yeah, I think it's all right.

524
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,731
Thanks.

525
00:34:55,415 --> 00:34:56,641
It's a safe room.

526
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,013
A panic room.

527
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,337
See this phone?

528
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:02,355
It connects only to one person.

529
00:35:02,483 --> 00:35:03,214
My brother.

530
00:35:04,013 --> 00:35:07,655
There's enough food and water to live in here for almost two weeks without having to come out.

531
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:09,937
And if anyone manages to get in the house,

532
00:35:10,061 --> 00:35:12,912
you'll see them on one of these TV screens.

533
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:17,290
See this?

534
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,046
Eight inches thick.

535
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:21,618
No bullet can get through the door or the walls.

536
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:25,231
Plus, no one-- and I mean no one in the world-- knows about it.

537
00:35:25,543 --> 00:35:27,582
The man who designed it and built it for me,

538
00:35:27,673 --> 00:35:30,495
he met with an unfortunate end shortly after finishing it.

539
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,111
But I don't get it, baby.

540
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:35,634
Why are you showing me this?

541
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:38,826
I got a lot of enemies.

542
00:35:40,463 --> 00:35:44,284
And I'm going to prison for a very long time and maybe never coming back.

543
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:49,454
I want to know that if someone tries to get to me through you,

544
00:35:49,952 --> 00:35:53,986
you've got somewhere safe to be until help is on the way.

545
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:03,872
Well, actually I did make contact with a ghost. It just wasn't Cerrera's.

546
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,388
Well, what would you like me to do? Should I send backup?

547
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:07,825
Do you need more cops down there?

548
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,607
No, actually, I was hoping to persuade you to do the opposite, maybe get everyone out of here.

549
00:36:50,162 --> 00:36:51,003
Freeze!

550
00:36:53,542 --> 00:36:56,363
I know you're a ghost, so this will sound silly, but drop that briefcase

551
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:59,677
and put your hands on your head or these men will gladly kill you a second time.

552
00:37:03,885 --> 00:37:05,584
You have the right to remain silent.

553
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,979
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

554
00:37:09,307 --> 00:37:10,899
You have the right to counsel.

555
00:37:11,124 --> 00:37:12,768
If you are unable to retain counsel, counsel...

556
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,567
What is... what is Pancuronium and Adenosine?

557
00:37:16,674 --> 00:37:18,610
Pancuronium and Adenosine?

558
00:37:18,856 --> 00:37:22,312
When injected in the right combination, they would stop both the lungs and the heart,

559
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:25,026
but only for a few seconds at a time.

560
00:37:25,122 --> 00:37:26,080
Of course.

561
00:37:26,295 --> 00:37:29,310
You only need a few seconds to be pronounced dead.

562
00:37:31,324 --> 00:37:36,346
Okay, so the trick would be to find someone you really trust

563
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:39,024
to substitute the drugs and administer them.

564
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:45,574
And suppose that people in your organization are holding someone's little boy hostage.

565
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:48,772
Well, then you could trust that they're gonna do what you want.

566
00:37:49,873 --> 00:37:51,814
So that got you out the door.

567
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,537
How did you get to the drivers?

568
00:37:55,562 --> 00:37:57,040
Come on. Tell me.

569
00:37:57,614 --> 00:37:59,535
What do you have to lose at this point?

570
00:38:03,052 --> 00:38:05,490
When someone makes $40,000 a year

571
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:08,096
and you offer them a million to give you a shot of adrenaline,

572
00:38:08,618 --> 00:38:11,491
you can be reasonably assured you're going to get your shot.

573
00:38:12,222 --> 00:38:14,577
Well, then who did the Medical Examiner examine?

574
00:38:14,649 --> 00:38:17,373
Who did the Coroner perform an autopsy on?

575
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:26,630
I don't know. I couldn't tell you.

576
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:29,012
It's not like he had a whole lot to say when we met.

577
00:38:36,664 --> 00:38:38,764
His Honor is going to like this headline.

578
00:38:39,107 --> 00:38:40,066
Well, good.

579
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,923
We aim to please.

580
00:38:42,896 --> 00:38:44,034
Terrific.

581
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:47,510
This is so much better for tourism than a ghost on a killing spree.

582
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:49,097
I'm sure it is.

583
00:38:52,645 --> 00:38:54,524
So, you want to tell me about it?

584
00:38:55,405 --> 00:38:56,427
About what?

585
00:38:56,597 --> 00:38:58,564
This crime that happened over a decade ago.

586
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,324
What? Big date?

587
00:39:01,976 --> 00:39:03,837
Fifth grade science fair.

588
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:05,465
You know what?

589
00:39:05,937 --> 00:39:09,090
It's held for over a decade. It'll hold one more night.

590
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:17,272
Make no mistake, parents-- these are our future Thomas Edisons...

591
00:39:17,401 --> 00:39:19,648
- these are our future Madame Curies...
- Ariel?

592
00:39:19,741 --> 00:39:21,829
Be still, honey. What are you looking for?

593
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:23,560
Sean.

594
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:26,156
I don't see him, and...

595
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,491
I don't see his mother.

596
00:39:30,763 --> 00:39:32,449
Well, I'm sure they'll be here.

597
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:34,039
...is awarded to...

598
00:39:34,768 --> 00:39:40,374
Ariel Dubois and Sean Bertoni for their extraordinary rocketry diorama.

599
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,544
Thank you. And, um...

600
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,477
thank you from my partner, Sean.

601
00:40:19,195 --> 00:40:22,619
We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed.

602
00:40:22,701 --> 00:40:24,887
Please check the number and dial again.

603
00:40:34,422 --> 00:40:36,408
Did you speak to his mother?

604
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:39,167
Is he okay? Does he know I have his ribbon?

605
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:41,384
Uh, no, I didn't speak to his mother.

606
00:40:41,497 --> 00:40:43,095
I didn't speak to anybody.

607
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,419
Uh, their phone's been disconnected.

608
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,178
What do you mean? Broken?

609
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:53,719
No.

610
00:40:54,134 --> 00:40:55,195
Shut off.

611
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:58,230
That's what you do when you move.

612
00:40:59,698 --> 00:41:01,236
What do you mean?

613
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,600
Sean wouldn't have moved.

614
00:41:03,913 --> 00:41:05,516
He just got here.

615
00:41:05,736 --> 00:41:08,004
Honey, I think maybe he did.

616
00:41:08,715 --> 00:41:11,967
At least... maybe his mommy did, and...

617
00:41:13,135 --> 00:41:14,138
Ariel...

618
00:41:15,485 --> 00:41:17,046
I think he's gone.

619
00:41:17,937 --> 00:41:18,847
Baby...

620
00:41:20,082 --> 00:41:21,235
Mommy...

621
00:41:21,511 --> 00:41:23,292
Mommy, why?

622
00:41:23,492 --> 00:41:24,372
Why?

623
00:41:28,116 --> 00:41:29,867
Define "irony."

624
00:41:31,105 --> 00:41:32,806
Oh, you know.

625
00:41:33,384 --> 00:41:36,795
Not steely. Not brassy. Just kinda...

626
00:41:38,981 --> 00:41:41,112
Irony. Got it.

627
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:43,533
Why don't you define "irony"?

628
00:41:45,106 --> 00:41:48,893
Thinking a little nine-year-old boy is going to break my daughter's heart...

629
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:55,088
and then discovering that despite all my special gifts,

630
00:41:55,631 --> 00:42:00,188
all my privileged knowledge, I am still not smart enough to see--

631
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:01,729
not smart enough to know--

632
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:06,030
that... it's actually destined to be me...

633
00:42:06,844 --> 00:42:09,327
me that's going to break my daughter's heart.

634
00:42:12,374 --> 00:42:14,469
She's so sad, Joe.

635
00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:17,078
She's so upset.

636
00:42:18,565 --> 00:42:20,161
And it's my fault.

637
00:42:20,873 --> 00:42:21,769
Today.

638
00:42:22,236 --> 00:42:24,200
It's your fault it happened today.

639
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:26,382
But it's not your fault it happened.

640
00:42:27,088 --> 00:42:28,800
You're not that important.

641
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:30,667
And you know what else?

642
00:42:31,379 --> 00:42:32,874
Her heart will heal.

643
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:34,492
It will.

644
00:42:36,714 --> 00:42:38,568
I don't want this anymore.

645
00:42:39,203 --> 00:42:42,107
I want to give all this special-ness back.

646
00:42:42,966 --> 00:42:44,339
Hmm, doesn't work that way.

647
00:42:44,856 --> 00:42:46,945
It's all part of the Allison package.

648
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:50,380
And we're all just stuck with it.

649
00:42:52,229 --> 00:42:53,350
Thank God.
