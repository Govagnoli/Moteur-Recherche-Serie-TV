1
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,250
?i have to get out

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,150
?i'm turning to a reason????

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,190
?hey lover

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,210
?he suppose to followe me out

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,499
In a minute.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,634
I was thinking of actually
getting some showering
done in here first.

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,534
ANNOUNCER:
 <i>In February, 1996,</i>

8
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:44,599
 <i>the police in Portland, Oregon</i>
 <i>were no closer to finding</i>

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,533
 <i>the so-called Suitcase Killer</i>

10
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:48,460
 <i>than they had been</i>
 <i>11 months earlier</i>

11
00:00:48,503 --> 00:00:51,637
 <i>when the first of his</i>
 <i>six victims was found--</i>

12
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:55,796
 <i>dismembered and stuffed</i>
 <i>inside a suitcase.</i>

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,090
 <i>They sought the assistance</i>

14
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:59,863
 <i>of FBI criminal profiler</i>
 <i>Edward Cooper.</i>

15
00:00:59,907 --> 00:01:01,703
 <i>Cooper's insights</i>
 <i>led the police</i>

16
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:04,943
 <i>to a failed dental student</i>
 <i>named Richard Gomez.</i>

17
00:01:04,977 --> 00:01:08,841
 <i>A search of Gomez's apartment</i>
 <i>yielded the bloody handsaw</i>

18
00:01:08,857 --> 00:01:11,650
 <i>that he used to dismember</i>
 <i>his victims...</i>
(man whistling tune)

19
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:13,511
 <i>During Gomez's trial...</i>
You better hurry up.

20
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:14,880
 <i>a bureaucratic error</i>
 <i>compromised the prosecution.</i>

21
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:16,850
I'm getting pretty into this
show, you might lose me.

22
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:18,992
 <i>The bloody handsaw</i>
 <i>was misplaced.</i>

23
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:21,832
 <i>Civic employees scoured</i>
 <i>the evidence storage room</i>

24
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:24,263
 <i>but they were never able</i>
 <i>to locate it.</i>

25
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:26,893
 <i>Richard Gomez was acquitted.</i>

26
00:01:27,508 --> 00:01:30,191
Richard Gomez murdered
those young women.

27
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:33,313
There's no doubt about that.

28
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:34,883
Seeing him walk free...

29
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:38,101
I'm not sure I can describe what
that feels like.

30
00:01:38,136 --> 00:01:39,602
 <i>To this day,</i>

31
00:01:39,636 --> 00:01:43,002
 <i>no one knows the present</i>
 <i>whereabouts of Richard Gomez.</i>

32
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:46,300
 <i>The serial killer</i>
 <i>who scoffed at the law.</i>

33
00:01:46,335 --> 00:01:52,633
(man whistling
"Strangers in the Night" )

34
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,630
Why'd you shut it off?

35
00:01:57,706 --> 00:01:59,442
I was watching that.

36
00:01:59,457 --> 00:02:02,052
(screaming)

37
00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:06,231
(Joe whistling
"Strangers in the Night")

38
00:02:06,268 --> 00:02:09,590
(shower running)

39
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:14,431
Hey, songbird, you think you
could keep the whistling down?

40
00:02:15,506 --> 00:02:18,733
I'm trying to have
a nightmare in here.

41
00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:33,731
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com Present</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@ID 
Sync:WWWKWOK</font>

43
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:14,503
Mommy, the syrup's cold.

44
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:16,603
That's okay,
the waffles are hot.

45
00:03:16,638 --> 00:03:17,990
Eat them both at the same time,
you got warm.

46
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:20,332
Guys, when you're done, bring
all your dishes to the sink.

47
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:23,993
ARIEL:
Hey, what's Marie doing?

48
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:26,001
There's nothing
on that channel.

49
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:27,491
Give me the remote.

50
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:28,831
No, Marie likes it.

51
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:31,243
And why can't she get
to pick sometimes?

52
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:33,092
She also like smearing
jelly all over her face,

53
00:03:33,106 --> 00:03:34,241
but that doesn't mean
we should let her.

54
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,910
So give me
the remote.

55
00:03:36,986 --> 00:03:39,082
JOE: You know what,
give me the remote.

56
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,293
It's morning, it's breakfast,

57
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:42,990
it's way too early
to be fighting over television.

58
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:46,000
It's way too early
for television period.

59
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:49,781
Right, Mommy?

60
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:52,090
Um, why aren't you guys
watching TV?

61
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,063
Daddy said no.

62
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:58,742
Hey, let Marie pick
for a change.

63
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:01,011
Turn it up.

64
00:04:05,418 --> 00:04:07,780
I had a dream about
this guy last night.

65
00:04:07,818 --> 00:04:09,150
Oh, yeah?

66
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:10,990
What's he got that I don't?

67
00:04:11,008 --> 00:04:12,102
As an amazing reputation

68
00:04:12,206 --> 00:04:15,192
as a criminal profiler
for one thing.

69
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,863
I read this book in college
for a criminology course.

70
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,943
Hmm...

71
00:04:19,957 --> 00:04:21,541
And the dream?

72
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:24,301
It was about an old
case of his from years ago--

73
00:04:24,457 --> 00:04:25,791
Richard  Gomez.

74
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,292
And the girl, the victim,

75
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:30,612
her picture's
no where in here.

76
00:04:31,616 --> 00:04:34,992
She doesn't look anything like
any of the people in here.

77
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:36,332
Sorry. (chuckles)

78
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:38,582
That's okay.

79
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:41,992
I think I just decided
to become a vegetarian.

80
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:43,533
(phone rings)

81
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:45,961
Allison Dubois.

82
00:04:47,008 --> 00:04:49,783
I'm sorry, you've reached
the wrong extension.

83
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:52,181
Sure, I can transfer you.

84
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:53,693
Actually, I can
see from here

85
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:56,102
the District Attorney's
not in his office.

86
00:04:57,305 --> 00:05:00,133
I believe he's in a conference.

87
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:01,240
DEVALOS:
Yes.

88
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:04,110
Sorry to interrupt... sir.

89
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,220
Allison, what?

90
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:11,742
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

91
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:13,390
I have a message for you.
He said it was important.

92
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:15,701
He's only going to be there
another half hour.

93
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:17,092
Uh-huh.

94
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:20,230
Um, oh, forgive me, I'm sorry.

95
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:22,390
Allison Dubois,
this is Special...

96
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:25,732
ALLISON:
Edward Cooper of the FBI.

97
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:27,762
I'm very familiar
with your work, sir.

98
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:29,630
It's an honor
to meet you.

99
00:05:29,786 --> 00:05:32,542
And what is it you do
for the District Attorney

100
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:34,403
that makes you so familiar
with my work?

101
00:05:34,557 --> 00:05:37,491
Uh, Allison was studying
law and criminology

102
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:38,571
when she came to work for us,

103
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:40,240
and while she doesn't
actually have a law degree,

104
00:05:40,255 --> 00:05:43,303
she's proven to be a very
effective resource when
it comes to jury selection.

105
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:45,852
Pretty good with crime
scene analysis as well.

106
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:48,140
I see.

107
00:05:48,156 --> 00:05:49,582
Jury selection, huh?

108
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:50,490
Yeah.

109
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:52,362
Well, you must be a good judge
of human nature.

110
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:54,500
Keen sense of intuition?

111
00:05:55,507 --> 00:05:56,930
You might like to join us.

112
00:05:56,978 --> 00:06:00,252
Actually, I need
to return this call

113
00:06:00,257 --> 00:06:02,743
and go over a few things
with Allison myself.

114
00:06:02,758 --> 00:06:05,952
Maybe  we can reconvene
back here in say ten minutes?

115
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:13,490
Edward Cooper!
Oh, my God!
Yes.

116
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,732
That's so strange-- I had
a dream about him last night.

117
00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:17,261
As you probably figured
out by now,

118
00:06:17,306 --> 00:06:20,151
Agent Cooper and his staff
are going to be using
the conference room

119
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:21,663
as their temporary
base of operations.

120
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:23,203
They're in town on a case.

121
00:06:25,507 --> 00:06:26,192
But to be honest
with you,

122
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,240
I was sort of hoping

123
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:29,403
that you wouldn't
run into each other.

124
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:30,292
Why?

125
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,260
I don't know. The man
makes me very nervous.

126
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:35,163
Anyway, I know I don't
really need to tell you this,

127
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:37,392
but we need to be especially 
discrete about what it is

128
00:06:37,406 --> 00:06:38,400
you really do here,

129
00:06:38,438 --> 00:06:39,901
and how you do it.

130
00:06:39,938 --> 00:06:41,992
Hey, as long as I can
sit in the room.

131
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:43,690
As you all know, three days ago

132
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,001
a jogger found the body
of Diane Colquitt

133
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,960
on a path in Boyce Park
here in Phoenix.

134
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:51,632
Diane was a
16-year-old prostitute.

135
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:53,033
Appears that someone
picked her up,

136
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:54,930
drove her to the park,

137
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:57,240
and  then strangled her
with own underwear.

138
00:06:57,258 --> 00:07:01,862
Every detail of Diane's killing
matches a series

139
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:04,733
of murders the Bureau and I
are investigating

140
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:06,343
up in Columbus, Ohio.

141
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:08,843
Four young girls dead,

142
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,403
all of them prostitutes,

143
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:13,490
all of them strangled
with their own undergarments.

144
00:07:13,503 --> 00:07:16,267
All of them found
hands bound behind their back

145
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,156
with a sailor's hitch knot.

146
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,040
Every girl dumped facedown
on a jogging path.

147
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:24,011
When was the last killing
in Ohio?

148
00:07:24,535 --> 00:07:26,340
Little over ten weeks ago.

149
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:28,850
So you're thinking
that your killer migrated

150
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:30,393
from the Midwest to here?

151
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:31,993
Killers aren't immune
to the cold.

152
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:33,863
They've been known to travel
south for the winter.

153
00:07:34,158 --> 00:07:36,002
This is a very preliminary

154
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:37,361
psychological profile
of the killer.

155
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:40,990
It appears that he is threatened
by women.

156
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:43,290
Based on the forensic
evidence recovered

157
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:45,200
from the four Ohio victims,

158
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:48,112
we believe that he prefers
to have sex with his victims

159
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:49,800
only after they're dead.

160
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:52,141
Has he left any bodily fluids
behind?

161
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:53,881
Any DNA to work from?

162
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,143
No.

163
00:07:55,157 --> 00:07:57,012
He's methodical about cleaning
up after himself.

164
00:07:57,866 --> 00:08:00,643
Extraordinarily thorough,
which makes me suspect

165
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:03,080
he's had a lot of practice
doing what he does.

166
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:07,493
I have an appointment with the
coroner to personally examine

167
00:08:07,507 --> 00:08:10,260
Diane Colquitt's remains.

168
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:12,592
My team and I will be there
at 3:00.

169
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:14,902
Anyone from this office
that would care to join us,

170
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:18,363
please do so.

171
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,991
JOE:
I'm sorry to stick you
with babysitting duty, honey.

172
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:22,241
Mommy called me
at the last minute

173
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:23,612
to pick you guys up.

174
00:08:23,808 --> 00:08:24,993
I got to get back to work.

175
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:27,002
We'll be okay, Daddy.
Bridgette and I have homework

176
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:27,943
and Marie can just sit

177
00:08:27,946 --> 00:08:30,452
with us and
watch television.
Police, fire, doctor--

178
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:32,503
all the numbers you need
are on the fridge.

179
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:33,791
Look, it's your favorite show.

180
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:35,331
You have my cell phone,
you have Mommy's cell phone.

181
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:38,432
One of us will be home by 5:30
at the absolute latest.

182
00:08:38,468 --> 00:08:40,492
Daddy, I've got it
under control.

183
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:41,491
Okay, we've got to find
something better

184
00:08:41,507 --> 00:08:43,402
for her to watch than this.

185
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:46,802
Back, back, back, back, back.

186
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,330
Huh, what's wrong, sweetie?

187
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:51,732
She likes the other one.

188
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:53,633
There's nothing on
the other channel.

189
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,630
Back, back, back,

190
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,632
back, back.

191
00:09:01,935 --> 00:09:02,963
Told you.

192
00:09:02,998 --> 00:09:04,400
WOMAN:
 <i>As you indicated on the phone,</i>

193
00:09:04,438 --> 00:09:08,292
the victim had been fairly
well cleaned up by her attacker,

194
00:09:08,307 --> 00:09:11,541
but we did pull this
off her underwear.

195
00:09:11,557 --> 00:09:12,811
It's dog hair.

196
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,060
Looks to me like something
from the terrier family.

197
00:09:26,337 --> 00:09:29,890
COOPER:
Her fingernails
have been cut.

198
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,270
Someone wanted to be sure
that we didn't find

199
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:34,412
any DNA
under them.

200
00:09:34,998 --> 00:09:36,841
This bruise on
her shoulder

201
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:38,713
is probably from
the killer's knee.

202
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,462
Perhaps forensics
could analyze it...

203
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:44,993
(man whistling
"Strangers in the Night")

204
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:47,163
...what the killer was wearing
on the lower half of his body--

205
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:48,993
denims, chinos...

206
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,663
Excuse me.

207
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:54,743
I was just wondering...
when you said earlier

208
00:09:54,757 --> 00:09:56,441
we were dealing with an
experienced perpetrator--

209
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:58,811
someone who was good
at what he did,

210
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:02,560
who clearly had a lot of...
practice,

211
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:05,793
I wonder if anyone had
considered the possibility

212
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:08,092
that the man who did this,
the man we're looking for,

213
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:09,832
might be Richard Gomez.

214
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:14,200
(clearing throat)

215
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,002
Richard Gomez...

216
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:19,133
No, we had not considered
Richard Gomez.

217
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:22,052
Frankly, to the best
of my knowledge,

218
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:26,790
Richard Gomez has been inactive
for more than ten years.

219
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,993
Any particular reason
you bring his name up?

220
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:31,701
Just, uh, a hunch.

221
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,500
Instinct.

222
00:10:34,536 --> 00:10:35,892
A hunch.

223
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:40,891
You know what I call a hunch
made without a scientific basis?

224
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:42,441
You know what I call
an instinct

225
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:45,453
uninformed by either experience
or intellect?

226
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:47,980
I call it a distraction.

227
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:51,360
I call it a waste of time.

228
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:53,140
Forensics also might be able

229
00:10:53,158 --> 00:10:55,840
to speculate as to
the perpetrator's weight

230
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,982
based on the depth
of the bruise.

231
00:10:58,006 --> 00:10:59,102
Correct me if I'm wrong...

232
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:00,990
Happily.

233
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:03,001
Gomez is still at large,
is he not?

234
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:05,700
How can you be so sure
this is not his work?

235
00:11:05,736 --> 00:11:06,592
What would prevent him

236
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:09,932
from killing and raping
these women in Ohio?

237
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,340
Seems to me if he's
still out there...

238
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:14,580
Mrs. Dubois...

239
00:11:14,955 --> 00:11:17,341
you indicated that you were
familiar with my work.

240
00:11:17,358 --> 00:11:19,580
If that's truly the case,
then you know

241
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:22,851
that Richard Gomez
was a dominance killer.

242
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,062
He used his charm
and good looks

243
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:28,990
to convince women to go back
to his home

244
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:31,333
or a motel room--
somewhere private,

245
00:11:31,505 --> 00:11:35,503
where he would violate them,
torture them

246
00:11:35,588 --> 00:11:39,412
and keep them alive while he
sawed them into little pieces.

247
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:43,243
He was a passionate
sadist.

248
00:11:43,258 --> 00:11:45,993
He took pleasure in their pain.

249
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:48,521
This killer--
the Lincoln Park killer,

250
00:11:48,535 --> 00:11:49,542
he strikes from behind.

251
00:11:49,557 --> 00:11:53,001
It's more of a blitzkrieg
style of attack.

252
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:55,673
It's the mark of a timid
personality, a coward.

253
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:59,941
These two men might as well
speak different languages.

254
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:04,591
Now, any other dormant
serial killers

255
00:12:04,606 --> 00:12:06,160
that you're curious about?

256
00:12:08,236 --> 00:12:11,832
Any other hunches,
any other random instincts?

257
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:21,362
?perhaps we can continue to the important working hand?

258
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,812
,
It was so mortifying.
(water running)

259
00:12:28,006 --> 00:12:29,560
He was so cutting.

260
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:31,282
He was so convinced
of his own infallibility,

261
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:33,833
he wouldn't even
consider the possibility.

262
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:37,663
Mmm... yeah. I think you need
to cut the guy a little slack.

263
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:40,393
He's been catching killers
for what, 30 years?

264
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:42,230
Now, you spent a
couple hours with the guy,

265
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:43,541
and all of a sudden
you're bringing up

266
00:12:43,557 --> 00:12:45,212
his most famous setback.

267
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:47,291
He's bound to get
a little testy.

268
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:51,263
What does <i>he</i> have
to get testy about?

269
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:55,762
Agent Cooper led the police
right to Richard Gomez.

270
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:56,930
He did his job.

271
00:12:56,968 --> 00:12:58,900
It's not his fault
somebody lost the evidence.

272
00:12:58,937 --> 00:13:02,401
You're right, but maybe Cooper
doesn't see it that way.

273
00:13:02,437 --> 00:13:06,263
Catching these people is pretty
much a crusade for him, right?

274
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:08,203
So when one of
them slips away,

275
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:10,702
I doubt he spends much
time consoling himself

276
00:13:10,738 --> 00:13:12,932
with the idea that he is
not personally to blame.

277
00:13:12,968 --> 00:13:16,261
Well, that doesn't give him the 
right to make a fool out of me.

278
00:13:18,968 --> 00:13:22,803
Are you using this
arm for anything?

279
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:33,903
GOMEZ:
 <i>Why'd you shut it off?</i>

280
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:39,003
I was watching that.

281
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:41,433
(screaming)

282
00:13:48,535 --> 00:13:51,833
(strained screaming)

283
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:56,830
(pained yells)

284
00:14:10,738 --> 00:14:12,733
(Gomez grunts, Allison gasps)

285
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:27,830
(knocking)

286
00:14:27,865 --> 00:14:28,833
Y up.

287
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:29,833
Sorry to bother you.

288
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:32,131
I need your help.

289
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:33,333
What does this mean?

290
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:37,433
Dioner Mapache--
it's a name.

291
00:14:37,465 --> 00:14:38,902
It's a man's name.

292
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:40,561
Uh... first name Dioner, 
last name Mapache.

293
00:14:40,598 --> 00:14:41,831
Why do you ask?

294
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:43,860
Actually, I think
it's a business,

295
00:14:43,906 --> 00:14:45,260
like a bar or restaurant,

296
00:14:45,305 --> 00:14:48,900
the kind of business that
advertises on hotel ashtrays.

297
00:14:48,935 --> 00:14:50,231
Wherever this business is,

298
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:51,901
I think it's located
nearby the hotel

299
00:14:51,937 --> 00:14:56,592
where... Richard Gomez
killed Diane Colquitt.

300
00:14:58,637 --> 00:15:00,231
( sighs)

301
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,300
Close my office door, Allison.

302
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:08,562
(door closes)

303
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:09,730
What are you doing?

304
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:11,760
Just what I always do.

305
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:13,290
But I believe
Agent Cooper

306
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:14,991
made it perfectly clear
that he's not interested

307
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:17,632
in any leads involving
Richard Gomez.

308
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:19,661
That he feels very strongly
that Richard Gomez

309
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:21,360
had nothing to do
with this woman's death.

310
00:15:21,406 --> 00:15:22,631
Well, he's wrong.

311
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,630
Allison...

312
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,230
(sighs)

313
00:15:29,558 --> 00:15:31,630
All right.

314
00:15:31,636 --> 00:15:33,463
All right. Let me...

315
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:36,161
see if I can try and get
Detective Scanlon

316
00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:37,861
to discretely
run this down, find out

317
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:39,563
if there is such a place
and where it might be,

318
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:43,001
but do me a favor-- stay away
from the conference room.

319
00:15:43,038 --> 00:15:43,991
Keep out of
Cooper's way.

320
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:46,562
Let's let him think that you've
moved on to something else.

321
00:15:47,108 --> 00:15:49,900
Let's let him think
that you're doing other things.

322
00:15:54,595 --> 00:15:55,540
Huh.

323
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:56,553
Okay.

324
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,391
 The government
wants the chassis

325
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:01,990
to be made
with light polymer.

326
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:04,993
They also want it
to hold six cameras,

327
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,333
but if you put six cameras
on it, the light polymer

328
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:10,542
won't stand up
to atmospheric pressure

329
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:12,141
which means we've got...

330
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:13,540
Nothing.

331
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:18,731
(head thumping)

332
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:22,700
Are we taking a break?

333
00:16:22,737 --> 00:16:24,562
(head thumping)

334
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:28,763
I think we're
taking a break.

335
00:16:31,768 --> 00:16:33,933
Deep breaths, Aaron.

336
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:36,863
Pretend we're not days
away from our deadline.

337
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:41,002
Think happy thoughts.

338
00:16:41,557 --> 00:16:44,013
Can you think happy
thoughts for me?

339
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:47,333
What are you
thinking about?

340
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:51,771
A.J. just turned three.

341
00:16:51,787 --> 00:16:53,593
There you go.

342
00:16:53,605 --> 00:16:55,561
My youngest just
turned three, too.

343
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:01,853
And now you say
something back.

344
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,852
Pretty soon we're
having small talk.

345
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:06,710
That's how a break works.

346
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:09,322
A.J. likes to
eat Play-Doh.

347
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:11,992
Congratulations.
You must be very proud.

348
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:15,583
Marie sits in front
of the TV and watches static.

349
00:17:15,587 --> 00:17:17,611
I think she'd do it
for hours at a time

350
00:17:17,655 --> 00:17:18,910
if we'd let her.

351
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:25,921
What?

352
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:27,250
Nothing.

353
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:29,581
It's...

354
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,273
It's none of my business.

355
00:17:31,286 --> 00:17:32,681
I'm sure
it's nothing.

356
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:34,762
You can't just say that.
What's nothing?

357
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:37,890
You say your daughter
just stares

358
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:39,532
at a blank channel for hours?

359
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:42,391
Well, like I said,
it's probably nothing,

360
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:45,860
and I certainly don't mean
to alarm you, but...

361
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:48,911
my brother has
an autistic son.

362
00:17:49,217 --> 00:17:51,753
That sounds like the kind
of thing he used to do.

363
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:54,751
It doesn't necessarily
mean anything.

364
00:17:54,758 --> 00:17:57,082
It's... It's
probably nothing.

365
00:17:59,618 --> 00:18:01,182
Yeah.

366
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:09,700
(elevator bell dings)

367
00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:24,380
Bad hunch, huh?

368
00:18:31,285 --> 00:18:32,442
His name is Warren Bell.

369
00:18:32,956 --> 00:18:34,213
He was in your
local registry

370
00:18:34,255 --> 00:18:35,250
of sex offenders.

371
00:18:35,285 --> 00:18:37,511
One of my people
remembered his face.

372
00:18:37,556 --> 00:18:39,942
Back in Columbus, we questioned
him about the murders.

373
00:18:39,956 --> 00:18:41,481
We just... couldn't find

374
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:43,350
any evidence to tie
him to the crime.

375
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:46,683
And now he's
here in Phoenix?

376
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:48,381
Well, he's a
sex offender.

377
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,543
He's obligated to register

378
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:51,510
whenever he moves
into a new community.

379
00:18:51,706 --> 00:18:53,080
I asked them to bring
him in for questioning.

380
00:18:53,855 --> 00:18:55,341
Sure you wouldn't
like to stick around?

381
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:56,452
You might find
it fascinating.

382
00:18:57,187 --> 00:18:58,683
Me? You think so?

383
00:18:58,716 --> 00:18:59,892
I don't know.

384
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:02,490
I think I probably lack the
experience and the intellect

385
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:05,132
to really appreciate whatever
it is you're gonna do or say.

386
00:19:05,505 --> 00:19:08,131
Besides, I wouldn't want
to be a distraction.

387
00:19:08,388 --> 00:19:10,781
I wouldn't want
to waste your time.

388
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:20,230
Want to know who
Dioner Mapache is?

389
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:21,380
You found it already?

390
00:19:21,755 --> 00:19:23,340
It's kind of an
interesting story.

391
00:19:23,358 --> 00:19:25,652
Turns out he was a general
in the Mexican army,

392
00:19:25,655 --> 00:19:27,752
killed by his own men
the night before a battle.

393
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:29,881
Given his less-than-
inspiring history,

394
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:30,990
I guess it isn't a surprise

395
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:32,270
there's only one
restaurant anywhere

396
00:19:32,288 --> 00:19:33,241
that's named after him.

397
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:34,843
It's in Mexico,

398
00:19:34,855 --> 00:19:36,951
half a block away from
the El Coyote motel.

399
00:19:38,758 --> 00:19:40,353
Would this be the
scene of the crime?

400
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,351
Yeah.

401
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:43,213
This is the place
I saw in my dream.

402
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:44,890
I called the motel,
asked them if they'd had

403
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:47,252
any suspicious activity
there lately, if anyone

404
00:19:47,257 --> 00:19:49,912
matching Richard Gomez's
description had checked in.

405
00:19:50,186 --> 00:19:52,950
Turns out there was someone
matching Gomez's description.

406
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:54,663
You're kidding.
I knew it.

407
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:56,092
We gotta tell Cooper.
I can't wait to see the look

408
00:19:56,105 --> 00:19:57,602
on that egomaniac's face.

409
00:19:57,606 --> 00:19:59,500
Nine years ago.

410
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:02,540
1997.

411
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:03,991
He checked in
under a false name,

412
00:20:04,008 --> 00:20:05,810
he wasn't carrying a wallet.

413
00:20:05,858 --> 00:20:07,913
They had no way
to establish his identity.

414
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:11,231
What are you talking about,
no way to establish his...?

415
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:12,690
I'm trying to tell you
that there was a murder

416
00:20:12,705 --> 00:20:14,661
at the El Coyote motel in 1997,

417
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:18,541
only Richard Gomez wasn't
the killer, he was the victim.

418
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:20,750
Looks like robbers tied Gomez

419
00:20:20,757 --> 00:20:22,381
to a chair while they
ransacked the place.

420
00:20:22,385 --> 00:20:24,652
They took what they wanted,
then put two bullets in him.

421
00:20:24,685 --> 00:20:26,211
Cops thought it might
have been drug-related.

422
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:27,801
I don't know what
to tell you, Allison.

423
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:30,540
I mean, unless he's unusually
spry for a rotting corpse,

424
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:32,292
I think it's fairly safe to say
that Richard Gomez

425
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:33,602
?it is not the leading part killer

426
00:20:41,317 --> 00:20:43,152
Joe?

427
00:20:43,706 --> 00:20:44,990
Where are the girls?

428
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:46,191
Homework.

429
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:51,411
Okay.

430
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:53,083
And what are <i>you</i> doing?

431
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:55,041
I'm watching our daughter
watch her favorite channel.

432
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,582
Yeah, I know
what you're thinking.

433
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:01,632
What channel?

434
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:03,082
That's what
I thought, too,

435
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:06,412
that she just likes to
watch nothing, static,

436
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:07,580
but I was wrong.

437
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:10,102
She just likes to watch
this particular channel.

438
00:21:10,108 --> 00:21:12,212
Channel 282.

439
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:15,013
You want to know what happens
when I try to change the channel

440
00:21:15,017 --> 00:21:17,562
to another channel
that just has static on it?

441
00:21:17,578 --> 00:21:18,871
She starts to cry.

442
00:21:19,556 --> 00:21:20,711
Want me to show you?

443
00:21:20,716 --> 00:21:23,540
No, I don't need you to prove
you can make our daughter cry.

444
00:21:23,556 --> 00:21:24,683
Why are you doing this?

445
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:26,383
I'm trying to learn.

446
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,712
I'm trying to understand.

447
00:21:27,758 --> 00:21:29,242
Watch this.

448
00:21:29,286 --> 00:21:32,581
Hey, sweetie, what are
you watching on the TV?

449
00:21:32,615 --> 00:21:33,713
Funny man.

450
00:21:33,757 --> 00:21:34,911
Funny man?

451
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:36,781
What is the funny man doing?

452
00:21:36,818 --> 00:21:38,310
Talk to me.

453
00:21:40,408 --> 00:21:42,093
Talking to her.

454
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:46,293
All right, babe, come on.

455
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,730
It's time to brush
your teeth.

456
00:21:49,818 --> 00:21:51,383
I'll meet you in there
in a minute, cupcake.

457
00:21:51,418 --> 00:21:54,752
Go on.

458
00:21:54,788 --> 00:21:56,583
All right, once again,
what are you doing?

459
00:21:57,405 --> 00:21:58,581
What am I doing?

460
00:21:58,588 --> 00:22:00,712
Are you okay with this?
This doesn't bother you?

461
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:02,982
You're not in
the least bit curious

462
00:22:02,986 --> 00:22:05,413
what the funny man might
be saying to her?

463
00:22:05,448 --> 00:22:07,043
What he might be showing her?

464
00:22:07,088 --> 00:22:07,842
She's three.

465
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:08,703
Exactly.

466
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:09,502
What does that mean?

467
00:22:09,507 --> 00:22:10,962
It means it's not normal.

468
00:22:11,537 --> 00:22:13,431
She has an
imagination.

469
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:16,042
Maybe.
Or maybe it's something else.

470
00:22:16,757 --> 00:22:18,043
I'd like to have her tested.

471
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,111
Tested for what?
I don't know.

472
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:22,981
Autism.

473
00:22:22,988 --> 00:22:24,542
She does not
have autism.

474
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:25,853
How do you know?
You don't know.

475
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:29,143
I know. I know my baby.
I know my daughter.

476
00:22:29,187 --> 00:22:31,941
Oh, yeah? Well, do you know
what she's seeing on that TV?

477
00:22:31,987 --> 00:22:34,681
No. And I don't
think it matters.
Well, I do.

478
00:22:34,717 --> 00:22:37,850
I mean, you see things
that aren't there sometimes,

479
00:22:37,886 --> 00:22:40,751
and, most of the time,
they're not pretty to look at.

480
00:22:40,787 --> 00:22:42,080
They're not
the kind of things 

481
00:22:42,115 --> 00:22:44,683
that you'd want
a three-year-old to see.

482
00:22:44,715 --> 00:22:47,592
Okay, I'm just trying
to understand this.

483
00:22:47,606 --> 00:22:50,660
Are you hoping she <i>doesn't</i>
have autism or that she <i>does?</i>

484
00:22:50,986 --> 00:22:53,940
Okay. I'm done
having this conversation.

485
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,190
Oh, that's
a great answer.

486
00:22:55,205 --> 00:22:55,990
I'll be in the shower.

487
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:58,010
You know, if it
bothers you so much,

488
00:22:58,065 --> 00:22:59,412
maybe you should
just read to her

489
00:22:59,415 --> 00:23:01,881
instead of sitting her
in front of the TV.

490
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:04,642
(door closes)

491
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:11,111
COOPER:
August 22, 1996.

492
00:23:11,146 --> 00:23:12,853
Excuse me?

493
00:23:13,238 --> 00:23:16,011
That's the day that
Richard Gomez was acquitted.

494
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:20,340
I mark the anniversary
in my calendar every year.

495
00:23:20,777 --> 00:23:22,912
My wife has learned
to avoid me on that date.

496
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:25,712
She says that I'm
a world-class brooder.

497
00:23:26,755 --> 00:23:28,683
But now,
because of you,

498
00:23:28,686 --> 00:23:32,513
August 22 is freed up for
more productive pursuits.

499
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:34,880
Thank you,
Mrs. Dubois.

500
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,211
A lot of people will
sleep easier tonight

501
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,012
because they know that
Richard Gomez is dead.

502
00:23:44,008 --> 00:23:46,643
I accused you of
wasting my time,

503
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:48,413
of being a distraction.

504
00:23:48,448 --> 00:23:51,182
I stand corrected.

505
00:23:51,215 --> 00:23:54,343
You have
terrific instincts.

506
00:23:55,806 --> 00:23:56,611
I wish I had

507
00:23:56,616 --> 00:23:59,181
been wise enough
to understand

508
00:23:59,215 --> 00:24:00,542
what they were
trying to tell me.

509
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:02,783
Thank you.
Although, to be honest,

510
00:24:02,786 --> 00:24:03,890
I really wish
they would steer me

511
00:24:03,907 --> 00:24:05,753
towards
the Lincoln Park Killer.

512
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:07,241
Well, might
not be too late

513
00:24:07,288 --> 00:24:09,382
for you to pitch in.

514
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,911
We couldn't locate
Warren Bell yesterday.

515
00:24:11,947 --> 00:24:14,343
He finally showed up at
his apartment this morning.

516
00:24:14,388 --> 00:24:15,991
They're bringing
him in now.

517
00:24:16,005 --> 00:24:17,901
I'm headed over
to interview him.

518
00:24:18,185 --> 00:24:19,943
Appreciate it
if you'd sit in

519
00:24:19,988 --> 00:24:23,913
and give me the benefit
of your expertise.

520
00:24:23,948 --> 00:24:26,582
I already told your men
back at my apartment.

521
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:30,642
I was home watching TV
the night that girl died.

522
00:24:31,008 --> 00:24:32,483
Can anyone
confirm that?

523
00:24:32,787 --> 00:24:35,981
No. I was alone
the whole time.

524
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:38,853
Nobody called?
Nobody came by?

525
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:43,110
COOPER:
You watch a lot of TV, Warren.

526
00:24:43,508 --> 00:24:46,483
I remember, when we met
back in Columbus,

527
00:24:46,487 --> 00:24:47,842
you said you were watching TV

528
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:49,543
on the nights the women
there were killed, too.

529
00:24:50,258 --> 00:24:52,312
I live by myself.

530
00:24:52,317 --> 00:24:54,311
TV helps fill up the quiet.

531
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:56,242
You up and
leave Columbus,

532
00:24:56,248 --> 00:24:57,883
the murders there stop,
you land in Phoenix,

533
00:24:57,916 --> 00:24:59,681
lo and behold,
girls start dying.

534
00:24:59,788 --> 00:25:00,843
I'm sure I'm not
the only person

535
00:25:00,858 --> 00:25:05,082
to move from Ohio to Arizona
in the past couple months.

536
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,100
I got a job here.

537
00:25:07,115 --> 00:25:09,310
I registered my whereabouts.

538
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:11,310
I'm allowed to move.

539
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:14,493
You work as
an apartment manager.

540
00:25:14,505 --> 00:25:15,601
Am I remembering that right?

541
00:25:17,145 --> 00:25:19,242
Are you a dog owner,
Warren?

542
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:20,881
No, I'm not.

543
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:22,811
Are you sure?

544
00:25:24,008 --> 00:25:27,330
You seem
a little uncertain.

545
00:25:28,386 --> 00:25:31,142
Can't smoke in here, Warren.

546
00:25:53,245 --> 00:25:56,010
It's okay, sweetie.
It's okay.

547
00:25:56,808 --> 00:25:59,231
(dog whimpering)

548
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:06,702
(sizzling, dog yipes)

549
00:26:08,805 --> 00:26:11,060
Excuse me.

550
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:37,731
You all right?

551
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:40,702
Thanks. I will be.

552
00:26:41,006 --> 00:26:43,093
I'm sorry I left the room.

553
00:26:43,107 --> 00:26:48,840
I found it hard
to be so close to that man.

554
00:26:48,855 --> 00:26:50,633
You have a hunch about him,
do you?

555
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:56,093
He keeps a dog
chained up somewhere.

556
00:26:56,108 --> 00:26:58,700
It looks like a garage.

557
00:26:59,357 --> 00:27:00,793
He doesn't feed it.

558
00:27:00,807 --> 00:27:03,290
It's barely alive.

559
00:27:03,305 --> 00:27:06,633
He tortures it
with a burning cigarette.

560
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:15,461
I've worked a couple
of missing children cases.

561
00:27:15,505 --> 00:27:18,103
Met people like you before.

562
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,831
You see things, don't you?

563
00:27:25,738 --> 00:27:28,861
That must be quite a burden.

564
00:27:33,256 --> 00:27:37,712
A long time ago,
at the start of my career,

565
00:27:38,305 --> 00:27:41,990
I made a choice.

566
00:27:42,005 --> 00:27:43,192
I dedicated myself

567
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:45,630
to getting inside
the minds of killers.

568
00:27:45,857 --> 00:27:47,883
To... going to worlds

569
00:27:48,306 --> 00:27:52,232
where other people wouldn't,
or couldn't.

570
00:27:52,245 --> 00:27:55,893
It's rarely been pleasant.

571
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,630
And it's changed me.

572
00:27:59,785 --> 00:28:02,831
But it was still my choice.

573
00:28:03,257 --> 00:28:07,693
You, Mrs. Dubois...

574
00:28:07,706 --> 00:28:09,572
you go into
the heads of murderers

575
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:11,143
whether you want to or not.

576
00:28:14,355 --> 00:28:18,463
I admire you.

577
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:21,030
But I sure don't envy you.

578
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:29,900
That one.

579
00:28:29,935 --> 00:28:31,640
Wise choice, my dear.

580
00:28:31,655 --> 00:28:34,241
See, she picked the one
with monsters and mayhem.

581
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:36,080
She takes after
her mother.

582
00:28:36,906 --> 00:28:39,161
That's my girl.

583
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:39,991
(telephone rings)

584
00:28:40,007 --> 00:28:41,263
Oh.

585
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,461
And here we go.
Hello?

586
00:28:44,805 --> 00:28:46,190
Allison,
it's Manuel Devalos.

587
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,632
I'm sorry to bother you at home,

588
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:48,843
but I thought you'd like to know

589
00:28:48,855 --> 00:28:51,002
that the police have executed
a search warrant

590
00:28:51,006 --> 00:28:52,241
on Warren Bell's apartment.

591
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:54,341
Did they find anything
that linked him to the murders?

592
00:28:54,355 --> 00:28:55,412
Not inside the apartment.

593
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,530
But in a garage
that he had access to,

594
00:28:58,008 --> 00:29:01,101
we did find a grey
wire-haired terrier.

595
00:29:01,135 --> 00:29:02,991
My God, was he still alive?

596
00:29:03,005 --> 00:29:05,461
Barely. We took a sample
of its hair.

597
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,662
Preliminary DNA tests indicate
that it's a match

598
00:29:08,675 --> 00:29:10,602
for the hair we found
on Diane Colquitt's body.

599
00:29:11,235 --> 00:29:13,293
We've placed Warren Bell
under arrest.

600
00:29:13,305 --> 00:29:14,742
That's great news, sir.

601
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:17,890
Agent Cooper wanted me
to call you and to tell you,

602
00:29:17,908 --> 00:29:20,833
and to send his thanks.

603
00:29:21,796 --> 00:29:23,690
Allison? What does he know?

604
00:29:23,706 --> 00:29:26,432
Oh, I don't think
he "knows" anything.

605
00:29:26,685 --> 00:29:29,240
There's no denying he certainly
has strong instincts.

606
00:29:29,257 --> 00:29:33,191
Mmm. Well, I guess I'll see you
in the morning.

607
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:35,030
See you in the morning.

608
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:39,892
(humming)

609
00:29:39,906 --> 00:29:41,430
You look happy.

610
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:48,460
(man singing in Spanish)

611
00:29:50,506 --> 00:29:52,283
What now?

612
00:29:52,285 --> 00:29:54,582
A leg or a breast?

613
00:29:54,938 --> 00:29:57,062
(door opens)

614
00:29:57,107 --> 00:29:59,631
Hello?

615
00:30:11,266 --> 00:30:13,433
You.

616
00:30:13,468 --> 00:30:15,433
How did-how did you find me?

617
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:19,460
Wasn't easy.

618
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:25,902
(gasps)

619
00:30:25,938 --> 00:30:27,332
(sighs)

620
00:30:28,755 --> 00:30:30,493
No wonder Cooper
was absolutely certain

621
00:30:30,506 --> 00:30:33,060
that Richard Gomez wasn't
the Lincoln Park Killer.

622
00:30:33,805 --> 00:30:34,993
I can't believe
I'm saying this...

623
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,432
it's not hard
to understand.

624
00:30:37,138 --> 00:30:38,790
Imagine that you're him.

625
00:30:38,808 --> 00:30:42,702
You catch this guy,
you do everything you need to

626
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:45,203
to be sure that he gets
the death penalty.

627
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:48,533
And then... they set him free.

628
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:53,002
He likes to kill, you know
he's going to do it again.

629
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:54,091
You track him down.

630
00:30:54,107 --> 00:30:56,862
You rectify the situation.

631
00:30:58,507 --> 00:30:59,403
So if you understand it,

632
00:30:59,408 --> 00:31:01,001
what are we doing
here in our kitchen

633
00:31:01,035 --> 00:31:02,860
at 3:00 in the morning
talking about it?

634
00:31:03,807 --> 00:31:07,331
I just don't understand what
I'm supposed to do about it.

635
00:31:07,337 --> 00:31:09,801
Am I supposed to speak out?

636
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:12,510
Ruin the life, the career,
of a good man

637
00:31:12,527 --> 00:31:13,991
just because he couldn't live
with the idea

638
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:16,603
of Richard Gomez getting away
with murder?

639
00:31:16,856 --> 00:31:19,040
Six murders?

640
00:31:19,865 --> 00:31:23,900
Even if I wanted to tell
the world what Cooper had done,

641
00:31:24,287 --> 00:31:26,830
it all happened nine years ago.

642
00:31:26,836 --> 00:31:29,132
I doubt I could prove anything.

643
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:32,473
You know what?
This is easy.

644
00:31:32,487 --> 00:31:33,483
Don't do anything.

645
00:31:35,005 --> 00:31:36,331
I'm completely
serious, Al.

646
00:31:36,335 --> 00:31:38,493
I mean besides, it's not
like you're absolutely certain

647
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:39,631
that Cooper did it.

648
00:31:40,785 --> 00:31:42,391
He shot him once in the head.

649
00:31:42,408 --> 00:31:43,831
He shot him once in the stomach.

650
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:44,993
I saw it, Joe.

651
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:45,763
I know.

652
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:48,801
But you also saw Richard Gomez
kill Diane Colquitt

653
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:50,231
in that very
same room,

654
00:31:50,358 --> 00:31:52,660
and we both know
that didn't happen.

655
00:31:53,257 --> 00:31:56,212
My point is, your wires have
been a little crossed lately.

656
00:31:56,777 --> 00:31:59,490
And unless you're absolutely
certain that it's true,

657
00:31:59,505 --> 00:32:01,502
you can't a accuse a man
of murder.

658
00:32:02,108 --> 00:32:04,833
And even if you
were certain...

659
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:07,702
I don't sense that you want
to accuse this particular man

660
00:32:07,715 --> 00:32:13,003
of this particular murder,
and I don't blame you.

661
00:32:18,808 --> 00:32:21,462
(inaudible shouting)

662
00:32:24,235 --> 00:32:26,263
(door slams)

663
00:32:37,008 --> 00:32:38,830
(heavy sigh)

664
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:47,771
Thanks.

665
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:50,542
I'm negotiating a deal
with Warren Bell's attorney.

666
00:32:50,557 --> 00:32:52,412
Agent Cooper doesn't like it.

667
00:32:52,936 --> 00:32:53,943
What kind of deal?

668
00:32:53,955 --> 00:32:55,941
We're offering to take
the death penalty off the table

669
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:59,200
in exchange for a full
confession to all the murders.

670
00:33:00,308 --> 00:33:01,910
I've got a few pieces
of dog hair--

671
00:33:01,968 --> 00:33:03,472
it's not much to stand on
when you're asking a jury

672
00:33:03,486 --> 00:33:05,243
to sentence a man to death.

673
00:33:07,106 --> 00:33:09,001
Given the paucity
of corroborating evidence,

674
00:33:09,008 --> 00:33:11,590
I felt the full confession
was the best way to end this--

675
00:33:11,605 --> 00:33:13,990
take Bell off the street
for the rest of his life

676
00:33:14,008 --> 00:33:16,630
and bring closure
to the victims' families.

677
00:33:17,108 --> 00:33:20,161
I've spoken with the authorities
in Ohio-- they agree with me.

678
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,950
Obviously, Agent Cooper
is advocating strongly

679
00:33:22,986 --> 00:33:24,852
for the pursuit
of the death penalty.

680
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:28,463
I don't sense that he's
big on compromise.

681
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:30,932
Noticed that, did you?

682
00:33:32,705 --> 00:33:34,443
Okay, well, it's clear what we
got to do-- we got to tell him

683
00:33:34,456 --> 00:33:35,910
that the satellite
can only carry one camera.

684
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:38,352
AARON:
Joe, this is a government
contract-- you sure you want

685
00:33:38,365 --> 00:33:39,790
to tell them
we can't meet their specs?

686
00:33:40,237 --> 00:33:42,101
No, I want to tell them that
their specs are fanciful,

687
00:33:42,115 --> 00:33:43,893
a creation of pure whimsy
on a par with the works

688
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:45,720
of Lewis Carroll.
MARIE:
Airplane!

689
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:47,740
But I can't do that,
so I'm just gonna tell them

690
00:33:47,755 --> 00:33:49,792
that the satellite
can only carry one camera.

691
00:33:49,805 --> 00:33:52,402
Airplane. Airplane.
Can you hold
on a sec?

692
00:33:53,105 --> 00:33:56,461
Hey, Bridgette, did you
turn on the TV for your sister?

693
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:57,992
BRIDGETTE:
She asked me to, Daddy.

694
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,462
It's no problem.
I was just asking
Airplane!

695
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:02,900
Airplane!
if we should...

696
00:34:03,387 --> 00:34:05,380
Hey, Aaron, did your son
just say "airplane"?

697
00:34:06,466 --> 00:34:09,200
Uh, yeah. He's watching TV.
He is?

698
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:11,560
He wouldn't happen
to be running around

699
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:12,743
the room
with his arms spread out

700
00:34:12,758 --> 00:34:14,452
like a couple of wings,
would he?

701
00:34:14,606 --> 00:34:17,301
He is, actually. Why?
Can you tell me
what he's watching?

702
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:20,703
 <i>Otis the Octopus--</i>
it's that show where the big guy

703
00:34:20,718 --> 00:34:22,410
in the fuzzy suit
makes him do jumping jacks...

704
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:23,982
Sorry, what channel
is he watching?

705
00:34:24,067 --> 00:34:26,001
Nugget. You know,
the kid's channel.

706
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:29,191
I'm glad he likes it--
it costs me $10.99 a month.

707
00:34:29,206 --> 00:34:31,232
So it's a premium station.

708
00:34:31,256 --> 00:34:32,881
Is that channel 282?

709
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:34,563
I don't know, Joe.

710
00:34:34,608 --> 00:34:35,993
We're kind of
on a deadline here.

711
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:38,032
Why are you so curious
about Nugget TV?

712
00:34:38,365 --> 00:34:40,573
C-Can you please tell me
if that is Channel 282?

713
00:34:40,585 --> 00:34:41,883
Okay.

714
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:43,633
(cartoon music playing)

715
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,630
Yeah, it's channel 282.
You happy?

716
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,963
ALLISON:
Hi. I'm home.
I came bearing pizza!

717
00:34:48,008 --> 00:34:48,891
Actually, I think I am.

718
00:34:48,906 --> 00:34:51,461
Listen, Aaron, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

719
00:34:51,505 --> 00:34:53,463
Hey. What's up?
Hi.

720
00:34:53,965 --> 00:34:55,562
Hey.

721
00:34:57,556 --> 00:34:59,180
I have good news,
and I have bad news.

722
00:34:59,437 --> 00:35:01,560
(groans):
What are you talking about?

723
00:35:01,608 --> 00:35:02,960
What's the good news?

724
00:35:03,008 --> 00:35:06,260
Uh, I don't believe that
our daughter has autism.

725
00:35:06,306 --> 00:35:09,062
In fact, I don't believe it'll
actually be necessary for her

726
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,092
to see a doctor at all.

727
00:35:10,106 --> 00:35:12,391
Well, that is good news.
And the bad news?

728
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:14,601
I think she might
be a felon.

729
00:35:14,635 --> 00:35:16,381
Excuse me?

730
00:35:16,387 --> 00:35:18,750
I think she's
stealing cable.

731
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:20,533
(door creaks softly)

732
00:35:20,568 --> 00:35:22,063
(light switch clicks)

733
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:01,660
(phone rings)

734
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:02,741
Hello?

735
00:36:02,755 --> 00:36:05,080
It's Edward Cooper.
Sorry to wake you, Mrs. Dubois.

736
00:36:05,435 --> 00:36:06,690
The district attorney
gave me your number.

737
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:09,891
We both felt that you'd want
to hear about it right away.

738
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:11,672
Hear about what?

739
00:36:11,686 --> 00:36:14,543
You might want
to turn on your TV.

740
00:36:16,285 --> 00:36:18,243
I don't know what to tell you.

741
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:20,701
God bless America.

742
00:36:21,256 --> 00:36:24,291
Last night my attorney
was advising me to take a deal

743
00:36:24,306 --> 00:36:27,431
so that I could avoid going
on trial for my life.

744
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:30,562
Then, at 5:00 this morning,
a prison guard

745
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:33,760
is shaking me awake
and telling me I can go free.

746
00:36:33,807 --> 00:36:35,503
I don't understand.

747
00:36:35,538 --> 00:36:37,770
COOPER:
Well, as I understand it,

748
00:36:37,785 --> 00:36:40,281
Bell's lawyer asked
the prosecution to produce

749
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:42,213
the evidence against his client.

750
00:36:43,008 --> 00:36:45,780
According to the law, they're
entitled to a second DNA test

751
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,282
at a lab of their choice.

752
00:36:47,528 --> 00:36:48,530
Apparently, when they went

753
00:36:48,537 --> 00:36:51,230
to the evidence room
to retrieve the dog hair...

754
00:36:51,965 --> 00:36:53,262
it was gone.

755
00:36:53,456 --> 00:36:54,962
No one can find it.

756
00:36:55,785 --> 00:36:58,962
This is unbelievable.

757
00:36:59,256 --> 00:37:02,231
Do they have any idea
what might have happened to it?

758
00:37:02,236 --> 00:37:03,802
Not really.

759
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:04,743
The district attorney thinks

760
00:37:04,758 --> 00:37:07,180
one of the clerks
must've screwed up.

761
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:10,433
(sighs):
What do you think?

762
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,561
I don't know.

763
00:37:13,018 --> 00:37:14,761
I don't know what to think.

764
00:37:15,256 --> 00:37:17,863
However it happened,
the evidence is gone,

765
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:20,141
and without it,
there's no way to prove

766
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:23,910
that Warren Bell was
the Lincoln Park Killer.

767
00:37:24,335 --> 00:37:25,830
He's a free man.

768
00:37:26,356 --> 00:37:26,890
BELL:
Of course, this is

769
00:37:26,906 --> 00:37:30,261
an enormous relief
for me and my family,

770
00:37:30,405 --> 00:37:31,691
and to anyone who wants to see

771
00:37:31,706 --> 00:37:34,000
the real Lincoln Park Killer
brought to justice.

772
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:38,900
Like I said, God bless America.

773
00:37:44,756 --> 00:37:47,852
ALLISON:
It must have been hard
to get rid of.

774
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:54,750
The handsaw--
the one Richard Gomez used

775
00:37:54,786 --> 00:37:57,020
to cut his victims
into little pieces.

776
00:37:57,286 --> 00:37:59,481
I've been thinking about it--
it's kind of bulky.

777
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,000
An awkward shape.

778
00:38:01,706 --> 00:38:03,803
It must have been hard for you
to get rid of.

779
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:07,401
Unlike, say,
a few strands of dog hair.

780
00:38:15,488 --> 00:38:18,123
It sounds like you're accusing
me of something, Mrs. Dubois.

781
00:38:18,137 --> 00:38:20,291
I am. I am,

782
00:38:20,305 --> 00:38:21,931
because I know.

783
00:38:22,306 --> 00:38:24,362
I know what you did.

784
00:38:24,526 --> 00:38:26,990
I know you got rid of the
evidence against Richard Gomez.

785
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:28,901
I know you tracked him
to Mexico.

786
00:38:28,935 --> 00:38:31,933
I know you put
two bullets into him.

787
00:38:32,957 --> 00:38:35,580
That's a colorful theory.

788
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:39,221
I'm guessing you
can't prove any of it,

789
00:38:39,255 --> 00:38:41,111
or I'd be talking
to the police

790
00:38:41,156 --> 00:38:43,982
and not a... consultant.

791
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:46,453
(wry chuckle)

792
00:38:46,487 --> 00:38:49,181
I am not gonna tell anyone

793
00:38:49,507 --> 00:38:52,100
about what you did to Gomez.

794
00:38:52,138 --> 00:38:53,751
I can carry around
that knowledge

795
00:38:53,768 --> 00:38:55,060
and live just fine.

796
00:38:55,758 --> 00:38:58,850
But knowing what
you are <i>going</i> to do,

797
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:01,790
that I don't think
I can live with.

798
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:04,531
I can't just step aside
and let that happen.

799
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:07,243
So before you go through
with what you're planning,

800
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:09,211
before you kill Warren Bell,

801
00:39:09,706 --> 00:39:12,491
you need to know
that I am on to you.

802
00:39:12,537 --> 00:39:14,962
I know what's coming.

803
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:18,192
And I will find a way
to expose you.

804
00:39:18,236 --> 00:39:19,863
(exhales)

805
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:24,132
You really are an extraordinary
woman, Mrs. Dubois.

806
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:28,362
I can see why the
district attorney values
your services so highly.

807
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:35,501
As far as Warren Bell
is concerned, my guess is

808
00:39:35,535 --> 00:39:39,240
that... he'll keep his
nose clean for a while.

809
00:39:39,257 --> 00:39:41,910
He knows he's in the
spotlight right now.

810
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:44,491
But someday...

811
00:39:44,505 --> 00:39:47,230
someday not too
far from now,

812
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,240
the sickness that
lives inside him

813
00:39:50,706 --> 00:39:54,030
will make its way
back to the surface.

814
00:39:54,066 --> 00:39:56,490
He'll kill again.

815
00:39:56,507 --> 00:40:00,431
He won't be able
not to kill again.

816
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:06,060
Unless something
happens to him.

817
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:08,603
Unless the universe
intervenes.

818
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:12,540
Maybe he'll wrap his car
around a telephone pole.

819
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:15,741
Maybe he'll die in an
accident in his apartment.

820
00:40:16,005 --> 00:40:19,790
Who knows, maybe he'll
just... disappear.

821
00:40:20,255 --> 00:40:23,242
That happens
sometimes, too.

822
00:40:23,258 --> 00:40:28,310
My guess is, if something
like that does come to pass...

823
00:40:29,186 --> 00:40:33,111
you'll think about
Diane Colquitt,

824
00:40:33,155 --> 00:40:36,241
lying in a park with her panties
wrapped around her neck.

825
00:40:36,255 --> 00:40:39,753
You'll think about all
those dead girls in Ohio.

826
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:41,342
Or maybe you'll
even think about

827
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:45,611
that poor dog down
in the garage.

828
00:40:46,258 --> 00:40:49,583
And who knows
what you'll do.

829
00:40:54,007 --> 00:40:57,862
I know we only just met
each other, Mrs. Dubois...

830
00:41:00,356 --> 00:41:06,182
...but I think we both
know that your choice...

831
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:10,882
(sighs) won't be as easy as you
imagine it's going to be.

832
00:41:15,258 --> 00:41:17,742
Call it a hunch.

833
00:41:17,757 --> 00:41:19,641
An instinct.

834
00:41:22,887 --> 00:41:37,882
