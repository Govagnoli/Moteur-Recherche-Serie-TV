1
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,909
Looking for something special?

2
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:22,185
My mom's birthday's coming up.
How are you feeling?

3
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:26,389
Still trying to get the taste
of hospital Jell-O out of my mouth.

4
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,225
But the leg's feeling better.

5
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,662
I thought of visiting, but....

6
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,060
It's okay. I understand.

7
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,309
I've gotta go. Bye.

8
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:08,762
Sure about this?

9
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,496
Follow the plan, Nathan.
Nobody will know you're there.

10
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:17,437
You smash, I grab. It's done.

11
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,271
Do your thing, kid.

12
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:31,618
Last time Martha was in,
she made a point of trying these on.

13
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:35,958
Did she try anything on
that didn't have four numbers in the price?

14
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:40,297
Well, I just got in some nice
costume pieces from a local designer.

15
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,560
Quite unique.

16
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,434
Straight from outer space.

17
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,704
Thanks, but I'll keep looking.

18
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,067
Not another step.

19
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:34,213
Don't you move.
The police are on their way.

20
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,783
-Clark, are you all right?
-Lana?

21
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,122
Lana, it's my eyes. I can't see.

22
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:46,654
Here, honey. Sit back, there you go.

23
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:54,656
Jonathan, we have to do something.

24
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:57,099
Yeah, I know, sweetheart, but what?

25
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,804
Clark's retinas were scarred
by that heat burst.

26
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,566
You saw the doctor, he was baffled.

27
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,938
He wasn't baffled. You handcuffed him.

28
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,138
The last doctor we trusted
sold Clark's blood to Lionel Luthor.

29
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,647
-We'll find one we can trust.
-We can't risk that.

30
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:14,583
Clark has lost his sight. We may have
to risk someone learning his secret.

31
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,719
Martha, this is not about Clark's secret.
His powers have hurt him.

32
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:23,158
And before we run out and just
do something, we should think this through.

33
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,724
Don't I get a vote?

34
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,136
Of course you do, Clark.

35
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,875
I think it may just be a question of time
before I get better.

36
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,768
Sweetheart, it could be permanent.

37
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,474
And there's a lot of people who learn
to live with disabilities every day.

38
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:49,015
What's the worst that could happen?
Go to school and walk through a wall?

39
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,232
Everyone's staring, aren't they?

40
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,492
-They're just digging your shades.
-Yeah.

41
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:08,199
Hey, man, let me give you a hand.

42
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,003
I've been up on this combination
since third grade.

43
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,542
Here you go.

44
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,450
If it helps, the guy who did this
landed on my mom's court calendar.

45
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:25,389
I don't think Judge Ross will be giving
this Masterson guy any breaks.

46
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,224
Clark.

47
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,528
-You're already back.
-It's nothing quite that heroic.

48
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,534
It's just a pit stop.

49
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,265
Well, if you need anything,
I'm here for you.

50
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,138
Class notes, help writing papers....

51
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,018
One thing I learned from my accident...

52
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,090
...is that you can't go through
something like this alone.

53
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:03,828
Just because I'm blind, doesn't mean
the issues between us disappeared.

54
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,591
This doesn't change anything.

55
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,797
I was just offering
a helping hand, Clark...

56
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,063
...but I won't make that mistake again.

57
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:18,802
Whoever said "absence makes
the heart grow fonder"...

58
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,312
...obviously hasn't met the two of you.
Here you go.

59
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,474
-What's the matter?
-Pete, did you hear that?

60
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,739
-Hear what?
-Hello.

61
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,110
-Chloe?
-She's not here, Clark.

62
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,081
-Hello?
-Pete, I can hear her right now.

63
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,719
What do you want?

64
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,754
I'm at school.
This isn 't the best place to talk.

65
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:07,690
I'm done with this.
Someone could hear me.

66
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,728
I can't believe you're calling me
after all that's happened.

67
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,663
Look, I told you before...

68
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,858
...my researching Clark days are over.

69
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:18,198
Really? I have such a vivid memory
of that young reporter...

70
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,568
...just eager to work
for the Daily Planet.

71
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,835
As an opportunity I provided for
with only one requirement.

72
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,910
Well, I gave you all the information I had,
Mr. Luthor.

73
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:32,677
Look, you have to look at Clark Kent
as a work in progress.

74
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:36,188
Tell me it didn't arouse
your instincts as a journalist...

75
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,756
...when you learned about
Clark's blindness.

76
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,491
Especially when the others at the scene
had hearing-related traumas.

77
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:47,500
Find someone else to connect the dots,
Mr. Luthor, because I'm done with this.

78
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:50,931
What are you gonna do, then?
You gonna go running back to Lex?

79
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:55,165
-Or what's left of him?
-Lex has a serious mental illness.

80
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:59,836
It's as if there's a--
A crack in his foundation, you understand?

81
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,410
The structure may look perfectly stable...

82
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,447
...but it can't take any pressure.

83
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:07,086
So we will let Lex sit in his office...

84
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,878
...sharpening pencils.

85
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:13,590
But I expect a full report from you
on Clark Kent, Miss Sullivan, by--

86
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,028
Clark, what happened?

87
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,897
Pete, there's something wrong.
You have to get me home right away.

88
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,382
So these sounds, they--
They just hit you all at once?

89
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,110
Like someone turned on
a giant stereo full-blast.

90
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:43,688
-Suddenly all the sounds were magnified.
-Here's the couch.

91
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,088
And then they just went away.
It was completely random.

92
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,361
Well, with your x-ray abilities
and your heat vision...

93
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,090
...I'm not really sure how
your senses should develop.

94
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,756
It may be just a one-time thing.

95
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,495
Or your body trying to compensate
for its lack of sight.

96
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,462
I just hope it goes away.

97
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,468
All the sounds, they were so loud.

98
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,510
I didn't know where they were
coming from or what they were.

99
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,642
Then there was Chloe and Lionel.

100
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,617
What about them?

101
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,323
They were on the phone.
They were talking about me.

102
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,686
I don't think it was
for the first time, either.

103
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,760
Hey.

104
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:26,262
-Lex, it's nice to see you.
-How are you? Mr. Kent.

105
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:29,163
I have to fill out paperwork
for Clark's principal.

106
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,530
Yeah, that stuff's due tomorrow.

107
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,809
Clark, I don't know what to say.

108
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,515
How about hello?

109
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,550
Come on. Behind the Ray-Bans,
I'm still the same old Clark.

110
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,952
You know, when my father
lost his sight...

111
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:53,115
...I contacted some of the world's
top ophthalmologists.

112
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,784
You just say the word,
I'll get any of them for you.

113
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,897
I appreciate that, Lex,
but this isn't a problem to be solved.

114
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,056
It's something I need to
learn to live with.

115
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,026
Look, I really don't wanna talk about it.

116
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:08,072
Even when people don't mention it,
I can hear the concern in their voices.

117
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,601
Trust me...

118
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,211
...I know the feeling.

119
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,479
I found there's an almost medieval prejudice
against the survivors of mental illness.

120
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:25,153
The only way I can put the insinuations
behind me is by proving my worth.

121
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,484
How are you gonna do that?

122
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,619
By returning to LuthorCorp.

123
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,691
My father's offered me
my old position back.

124
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:37,366
Lex, do you think that job offer
is for real?

125
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,004
Why, Clark?

126
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,503
You know something I don't?

127
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:47,176
I heard that that job offer's a sham.
Your dad doesn't really think you're better.

128
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,784
So he thinks I'm just gonna sit in my office
and twiddle my thumbs?

129
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,787
No, his exact words were
"sharpening pencils."

130
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,027
Clark, where did you hear this?

131
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,391
It doesn't matter where I heard it.

132
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:08,534
The important thing is,
you need to be careful.

133
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,567
-Hi, sweetheart.
-Hi.

134
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,377
You know, Jonathan, I was thinking,
maybe we should hire extra hands.

135
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,848
You look tired.
I'm concerned about you.

136
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:31,387
No, Martha,
we're barely making ends meet as it is.

137
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,885
It won't help if you wind up
in a hospital bed.

138
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,757
I'll be all right, I just need....
Need to catch my breath.

139
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,959
What are you doing?

140
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:44,502
Board of education disability application
to get Clark a special teacher.

141
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,668
His counselor said that
he could take his regular classes.

142
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,241
Until when?

143
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,568
His life has changed...

144
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,142
...and so has yours,
but neither one of you will admit it.

145
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,682
-Martha--
-You both think you're supermen...

146
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:02,686
...who can do everything alone,
but you can't anymore.

147
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,890
You need to start relying on people,
and so does he.

148
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,406
So I got a letter
from the insurance carrier.

149
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,709
Apparently, my entire medical bill
has been taken care of?

150
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,549
Well, who said all insurance companies
are evil?

151
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,486
It wasn't your fault, Lana.
It was mine.

152
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:45,460
I pushed you into the stall.
That spooked the horse.

153
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,463
-Lex, you were--
-Crazy?

154
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,230
Not yourself.

155
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:54,931
Semantics aside, you got caught
in the crossfire trying to help me.

156
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,474
For that, I'm truly sorry.

157
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:02,474
As much as I appreciate
the grand gestures...

158
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:06,449
...you could've just stopped by the Talon
and said hello.

159
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:10,411
Yeah, well, the grand gestures
have always come easier.

160
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,822
I'm sorry I couldn't be there
during your rehabilitation...

161
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,294
...but I'm sure Clark was more than able
to pick up the slack.

162
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,591
Actually, Clark hasn't been around.

163
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,270
We kind of decided the best way
to stop hurting each other...

164
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,703
...was to stop seeing
each other altogether.

165
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,803
Given his new reality, I'm sure
he could use your support right now.

166
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,714
The brave front's an act, Lana.
My father did the same thing.

167
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,718
Lex, I've tried to reach out to him.

168
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:46,285
I don't think my presence
is going to raise his spirits.

169
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:52,130
By the way, who's Adam?

170
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,096
I noticed the Talon bills included some...

171
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:02,070
...gift baskets sent to him
at the Smallville Medical Center.

172
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,142
I'm going to reimburse the shop.

173
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,608
You still haven't answered my question.

174
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,642
He's a friend I made in physical therapy.

175
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,253
Must've made quite an impression.

176
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,514
Yeah, he did.

177
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,158
Don't be a stranger.

178
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,683
Clark?

179
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,779
-Chloe.
-Hi.

180
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,455
Look, as much as I try and avoid
unbearable cliches...

181
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,529
...if there's anything I can do, just....

182
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,256
I'll manage.

183
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:05,098
You didn't come all the way out here
to check out the blind guy.

184
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,705
Actually, I'm on something of a mission.

185
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,739
Have you seen Pete?

186
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,338
Sorry.

187
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,641
It's....

188
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:18,043
We were supposed to meet this morning
and double-team my Daily Planet column--

189
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,482
Is that the column
Lionel Luthor helped you land?

190
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,185
What's that supposed to mean?

191
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:33,061
I may have lost my sight,
but things are becoming much clearer now.

192
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,131
Exactly how long have you and Lionel
been looking into my life?

193
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,400
Since last spring.

194
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,810
The day after Lex's wedding.

195
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,151
When you saw me and Lana together.

196
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,520
Is that why you did this?

197
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,826
Your silence is deafening.

198
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,924
-What did you give him?
-Nothing.

199
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:09,159
-Nothing he didn't already know.
-Then what is he sharing with you?

200
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,859
Nothing.

201
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,767
Believe it or not, Clark,
I was trying to help you.

202
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,498
-By spying on me?
-No...

203
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:19,873
...by trying to understand
why he's so intrigued with you.

204
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:24,608
And if the Torch got new computers, or you
made a name for yourself, that's okay too.

205
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,909
After accusing me of keeping secrets,
how could you do this to me?

206
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,151
I was....

207
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,926
He just-- He caught me
at an especially bad time...

208
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,920
...and I caved.

209
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,788
I'm trying to get out of it, but when
people like Lionel Luthor have you...

210
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,730
...they don't want to let go.

211
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,265
I thought that you, out of all people...

212
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:52,377
...would understand making a stupid
decision in a moment of weakness.

213
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,412
But I guess I was wrong.

214
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,993
Clark!

215
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,140
Your parents are ready to start
gluing your picture to milk cartons.

216
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,003
How'd you get out here, anyhow?

217
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,439
I walked.

218
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,670
Turns out I do know
every inch of this farm.

219
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,778
I really didn't mean to scare them.
I couldn't take all the noise.

220
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:34,419
So your mega-hearing is back?

221
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,583
Suddenly, I'm the ultimate eavesdropper.

222
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,427
Did someone follow you?

223
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,064
No. Why?

224
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,734
Clark.

225
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,532
Ross! Get in the truck!

226
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,334
Pete, what's going on?

227
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,886
-Pete?
-I said, get in the truck!

228
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,227
Pete, who is that?

229
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,899
Pete, what's going on? Talk to me.

230
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,065
Pete!

231
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:37,182
-So they didn't find anything by Pete's car?
-Nothing helpful.

232
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,081
Whoever took Pete made the same sound
Clark heard at the jewelry store.

233
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:42,778
There has to be a connection.

234
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,513
I understand that, Mrs. Kent...

235
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,683
...but frankly, your son's
ear-witness testimony isn't much help.

236
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,954
No, it is too a help, sheriff.

237
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,291
It means that Masterson
has an accomplice.

238
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:57,197
And in a town of 45,000 people,
that doesn't exactly narrow things down.

239
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,134
No, but I'd think it'd give you
a place to start. Abby?

240
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,540
Judge Ross? You should be home
in case there's a ransom demand.

241
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,869
They just called.
I asked your deputy to bring me here.

242
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,514
Is Pete all right?

243
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,616
So far.

244
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,752
Abby....

245
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,686
-What do they want?
-Masterson's pretrial hearing is tomorrow.

246
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,354
Apparently, his attorney is going to make
a motion to dismiss all charges.

247
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:31,766
If I don't grant it,
they're gonna kill my son.

248
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,937
Oh, my gosh. Abby....

249
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,428
Clark, you mind telling us
what's going on in here?

250
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:07,198
-I'm trying to focus my hearing!
-I take it you're not having much luck!

251
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,838
If I don't get a handle on this,
I can't save Pete.

252
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,644
Clark, Judge Ross was at the house.

253
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,454
I know. Dad, I heard.

254
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,949
Playing chicken with the kidnappers
is not a good idea.

255
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:30,318
They're gonna kill Pete.
I've gotta focus. Help me.

256
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,225
All right, let's get to work, then.

257
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,814
Listen for your father's voice.

258
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,770
All right, Clark, concentrate.

259
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,279
Concentrate on my voice, son.

260
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,807
Dad!

261
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,882
Clark. Clark!

262
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:36,293
Dad, it's okay. It's okay.
For a second, I could hear you.

263
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,390
That's great. I was barely whispering.

264
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,864
Okay. Let's keep working.

265
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,409
Focus, Clark.

266
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,407
Focus on my voice.

267
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,113
Can you hear me?

268
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,511
Good.

269
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,385
Lex?

270
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:13,259
I'm sorry, son.
I'm afraid I don't have much time.

271
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,993
I have to be back in Metropolis in an hour.
What did you want to talk about?

272
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:22,038
When I was released from the institution,
you welcomed me back with open arms.

273
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,199
That's right.

274
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:28,676
I should've known better than to
take your promises at face value.

275
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,580
I don't understand, son.
What are we talking about?

276
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,810
Humiliation.

277
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:40,055
Word's out that my position at LuthorCorp
will consist of a title and little else.

278
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:42,524
That's foolish, son.

279
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,562
I've always wanted you to work with me.
You know that.

280
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:48,389
To do what? Sharpen pencils?

281
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:58,902
Lex, please. Listen to me.

282
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:02,639
If you thought you could throw me
behind a desk and forget about me...

283
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:04,976
...you're making a grave mistake.

284
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:08,481
Unless, of course, my source is wrong.

285
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,948
It's true, Lex.

286
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:14,286
I have been disappointed
with your performance in the past...

287
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,360
...but it's nothing
I haven't said to you.

288
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,895
And, evidently, to anyone who will listen.

289
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,557
So I have to keep proving myself,
is that it?

290
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:27,399
Unfortunately, we have to
prove ourselves every day.

291
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,473
I've come to accept that...

292
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:32,236
...and in time, so will you...

293
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,969
...I hope.

294
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,910
Lex, listen to me.

295
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:42,150
If someone is trying
to drive a wedge between us...

296
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,846
...someone we both know...

297
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:47,955
...then that's treachery, son.

298
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,159
Who is this source of yours?

299
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:57,128
Who were you talking to when
you decided to trash me behind my back?

300
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,668
Dad, I'm really worried about Pete.
We've looked everywhere.

301
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,849
Well, we're at the Talon, Clark.

302
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:16,044
I thought maybe you and l
could get an update.

303
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:18,887
I'll be right back, son.

304
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:24,221
-That was fast.
-Your dad told me you were out here.

305
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,932
Lana.

306
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:30,393
I thought you might want some company.

307
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:35,802
-But if you don't....
-No, please stay.

308
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,205
About this morning....

309
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,903
It's okay, Clark. You were upset.

310
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:45,681
No. It's not okay.

311
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:48,820
All I've managed to do lately
is push people away...

312
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,754
...and the truth is, Lana,
I miss having you in my life.

313
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,853
But I understand why
you don't want me around.

314
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,460
I was hurt and scared.

315
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:04,626
Clark, I overreacted.

316
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:09,004
The way I've been treating you,
I'm surprised you didn't bolt sooner.

317
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:13,439
I know you had your reasons
for pulling away.

318
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,748
Maybe those reasons are gone.

319
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,445
What are you saying?

320
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:27,615
What I'm saying is,
my life is different now...

321
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:30,919
...and one thing I've realized is
I don't want to be alone.

322
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:39,193
Clark, you're not alone.

323
00:25:57,456 --> 00:26:00,152
I should get back inside.

324
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,751
Lana, what is that?

325
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,029
What, the tow truck?

326
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,431
-It's the same sound as when Pete--
-Pete?

327
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:15,834
Clark, what's going on?

328
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:18,808
Lana, this is very important.
Go get my dad.

329
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,849
-Help!
-Pete?

330
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:06,821
Can anybody hear me?

331
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,653
Pete!

332
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,556
Clark!

333
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,286
Clark, help!

334
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,060
Clark, help!

335
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:15,530
Shut up!

336
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,314
Pete!

337
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,915
Pete, where are you?

338
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,796
How's that, blind man?

339
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,541
Come on! Come on!

340
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:02,606
Pete!

341
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:19,261
-Any more improvement?
-A little, but everything's still a blur.

342
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:23,299
-At least I won't walk through walls.
-What about your other abilities?

343
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:26,363
The x-ray vision and heat vision,
they're still gone.

344
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,701
Well, the heat from the torch
must've broken up the scar tissue.

345
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,275
Maybe the rest will just
take time to heal.

346
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:35,604
-Pete's still out there.
-Clark, Pete could be anywhere.

347
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:37,772
You already told
Sheriff Adams everything.

348
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,611
Well, I can't just sit here.

349
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:46,150
Okay, but before we do anything else,
there's one stop we have to make.

350
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:54,457
Clark, come on out.

351
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,334
-Sweetie, they look fine.
-Yeah?

352
00:28:58,504 --> 00:28:59,732
-Yes.
-Yeah.

353
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,634
Now, what's your plan to find Pete?

354
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:05,737
The Masterson hearing is in an hour.
We know he's trying to set up an exchange.

355
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,811
If Mrs. Ross lets him go,
I'll follow him.

356
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,738
Son, that is such a long shot.

357
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,415
That's all I've got.

358
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,295
Was there any result with the change?

359
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,934
All right, do it again.

360
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,871
How long will that take?

361
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,970
All right, call me when you're done.

362
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:46,175
I guess this is the part where
I'm supposed to cough suggestively?

363
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:48,285
I don't have any
new information on Clark.

364
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:53,390
And if I did, I would've happily e-mailed
it to you, sans the three-hour drive.

365
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,687
Would that have been before or after
you spoke to Lex?

366
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,359
What are you talking about?

367
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,192
You know, Miss Sullivan,
these coy evasions may work...

368
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:06,235
...when you're wheedling information out of
the high school librarian, but up here...

369
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:07,963
...you're out of your league.

370
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,299
Mr. Luthor, what's this about?

371
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,775
We had what I assumed
was a private conversation...

372
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:17,279
...but imagine my surprise to have Lex...

373
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:20,543
...throw my very own words
right back in my face.

374
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,914
You led me to believe that you were
no longer in communication with Lex.

375
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,722
Well, I'm not...

376
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:32,762
...but thank you for
the wildly offensive insinuation.

377
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,491
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm on a deadline.

378
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:39,265
Not anymore. Your column
at the Daily Planet's been canceled.

379
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,097
What?

380
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:49,840
All right, all right. Here's the deal.

381
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,950
Tell me everything you fed to Lex,
I'll let things stand.

382
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:56,144
I told you, I'm not Lex's source.

383
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,516
And while I'm sure you could
kill my column...

384
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,819
...this isn't the only piece I'm working on
for the Daily Planet.

385
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:06,624
I know I could interest them in a story
about an eccentric billionaire...

386
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,426
...with an obsessive interest
in a Kansas farm boy.

387
00:31:17,743 --> 00:31:19,438
Are you threatening me?

388
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:28,451
I'd be careful, Miss Sullivan.
Very careful.

389
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,184
I'll be whatever I want.

390
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,652
Apparently, I don't work for you anymore.

391
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:57,104
Judge, I've got people fanning out from
that garage trying to find your son.

392
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:00,046
-But we are running out of time.
-I know.

393
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,949
Releasing Masterson goes against
everything that I believe in.

394
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,090
But if I don't...

395
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,655
...it could mean Pete's life.

396
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,696
Look at him.
He knows he has us over a barrel.

397
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,528
What are you gonna do?

398
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,259
Until the hearing starts, pray.

399
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,916
Hello?

400
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:41,355
-Nathan.
-Talk to me.

401
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:42,823
Everything's set.

402
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,588
If this judge is smart,
I'll be out in 20 minutes.

403
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:48,597
Cool. Then it worked?
So what do you want me to do next?

404
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:52,294
When I'm out, get rid of the Ross kid.
We'll meet as planned in Metropolis.

405
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:56,174
Done. Ross 'll be a pile of junk in a minute.

406
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,870
Pete!

407
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:35,111
Hey, you work here?

408
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:37,773
What the hell?
What are you doing here?

409
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,112
-Where's Pete?
-ln a minute, neither one of you will care.

410
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:06,171
Help me!

411
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,303
Can anybody hear me?

412
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:10,847
Help me!

413
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:12,810
Help!

414
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,690
Pete! Pete, are you okay?

415
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,691
Clark.

416
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:39,575
And that's the way I pulled myself
out of the compactor and got away.

417
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,611
Oh, my God.
That's the bravest thing I've ever heard.

418
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:46,842
Well, you know, if I didn't do something
fast, I'd be Spam in a can, so....

419
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,213
Well, I'm glad you're okay.

420
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,519
Call me.

421
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,254
I will do that.

422
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:58,392
I have a feeling I'll be hearing
this story for a long time.

423
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,190
Busted.

424
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:03,391
Well, you know, what can I say?
Chicks dig a hero.

425
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,160
Hope you don't mind
I'm bending the truth.

426
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:08,829
Look who you're talking to,
the master truth-bender.

427
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:12,374
After everything you've done for me,
it's the least I can do.

428
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,072
What's the matter?

429
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:17,340
My eyes are just adjusting.
I think I need a new prescription.

430
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:18,777
Hey.

431
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:23,050
Hey, Chloe.
Hey, I'm ready for my big Torch interview.

432
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,883
Sorry, Pete,
I'm gonna have to reschedule.

433
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:30,255
-I'm really glad you're feeling better.
-Chloe, what's the matter?

434
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,225
-I just lost my Daily Planet column.
-What?

435
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,458
Why?

436
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,800
They didn't exactly spell it out
on the pink slip.

437
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:47,141
In the "when it rains, it pours" category,
my dad just got laid off from LuthorCorp.

438
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,872
That doesn't make sense.
He's worked there for years.

439
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:53,441
If you want answers, ask Lex.
He's the one that dropped the ax.

440
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:08,363
Clark. I heard about
your miraculous recovery.

441
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:11,900
I just found out that you fired
Chloe's father today.

442
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:18,072
Yeah, well, apparently,
his performance was seriously lacking.

443
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:21,972
He's worked for the company for years.
This could ruin Chloe's family.

444
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:28,176
My father suspects Mr. Sullivan was the one
spreading the malicious rumors about me.

445
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:31,288
I assumed Chloe overheard the gossip
and passed it along to you.

446
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:34,084
-No, this isn't right.
-It's not about being right.

447
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:36,193
It's about positioning.

448
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,762
-My father won a battle today.
-And Chloe's father is a casualty.

449
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:43,259
True, but the war's just starting...

450
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:45,926
...and I have the greatest advantage:

451
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:47,332
He thinks I'm weak.

452
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,142
Frankly, Clark,
I thought you'd be relieved.

453
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:57,905
-Why would you think that?
-Because at least this way...

454
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,779
...I was able to keep you out of it.

455
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:29,703
Looks like you're back to normal.

456
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:32,711
Hey, Lana.

457
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,289
I'm glad you're here.

458
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:43,526
I wanted to talk about
what happened in the truck.

459
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,829
Right. I wanted to talk to you
about that too.

460
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,191
I was way out of line.

461
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:54,865
-I felt vulnerable, but I don't expect--
-Clark....

462
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,907
The reason I pulled away...

463
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,239
...is that...

464
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:06,680
...I met someone at the hospital.

465
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:12,752
And I'm not sure how I feel about him.

466
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:21,431
Well, I mean, the fact you're telling me
about him means you already know.

467
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,304
Maybe you're right...

468
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:31,338
...but if you and l
are going to be friends...

469
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,909
...I didn't want you to find out
from somebody else.

470
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:37,847
Yeah. Yeah.

471
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,312
Well, I should get back to the Talon.

472
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,653
Hey, Lana?

473
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:59,663
Thanks for being honest.

474
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:06,808
Well, it's the only way
a relationship can last, right?

475
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
