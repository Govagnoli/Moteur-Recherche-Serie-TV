1
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,080
This has got to stop.
Open your eyes, Lex!

2
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,440
I can't!

3
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,000
Luthors are not afraid!

4
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,000
We don't have that luxury.
We're leaders.

5
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,040
You have a destiny. You'll never
get anywhere with your eyes closed.

6
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,560
Abracadabra.

7
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,640
- Afternoon, Nell.
- Jonathan!

8
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,680
Martha. What a surprise.

9
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,400
What brings the reclusive
Kents to town?

10
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,200
Tulips. Red ones, if you have them.

11
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,240
What about a tiger orchid?

12
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,720
No, thanks. Martha has
her heart set on tulips.

13
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,280
Yes, well, they are a very
uncomplicated flower.

14
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,280
That's a beautiful dress, Lana!
Are you a princess?

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,440
- I'm a fairy princess.
- Where are her parents?

16
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,760
They're at the homecoming game.
I'm being the good aunt.

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,880
Do you want to make a wish?

18
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,520
I would love to make a wish.

19
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,120
Abracadabra.

20
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,120
I know what you wished for.

21
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,920
I see a little face.
It's all I ever wanted.

22
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,120
Hey, looks like Smallville won again.

23
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,560
Lex? Son?

24
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,760
Now, where do I sign?

25
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,600
Right here, Mr. Luthor.

26
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,280
- Help me.
- Huh?

27
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,120
Help me, please.

28
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,440
Hey, kid...

29
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,960
Help me.

30
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,080
Help me, please.

31
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,440
What on God's earth...?

32
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,520
Hi, Lana!

33
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,360
Mommy! Daddy!

34
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,600
What's happening, Jonathan?

35
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,120
Lex! Lex! Where are you?

36
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,240
Lex? Lex?

37
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,920
Martha?

38
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Kids don't just fall out
of the sky, Martha.

39
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,680
- Then where did he come from?
- I don't know.

40
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,720
But he must have parents.

41
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,960
If he does, they're
definitely not from Kansas.

42
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,240
Sweetheart, we can't keep him.

43
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,160
What'll we say?
We found him in a field?

44
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,280
We didn't find him.

45
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,560
He found us.

46
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,960
Pilot

47
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,400
Clark, you're gonna be late!

48
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,920
Coming, Mom.

49
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,760
- Ah, ah!
- It tastes better from the bottle.

50
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,080
- Where'd you learn your manners?
- On a farm.

51
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,440
Afternoon, sleepyhead.

52
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,960
I have class tonight so you two are
on your own. And no pizza!

53
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,440
There's food in the fridge.

54
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,640
Hey, what you got there, son?

55
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,160
Permission slip.

56
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's for the football team. They're
having tryouts this afternoon.

57
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,440
- You played football, Dad.
- That was different.

58
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,840
- Why?
- You know why.

59
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,960
I'll run at half speed...

60
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,440
Lot of things can happen
in the heat of the game.

61
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Most of the guys hardly play.

62
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:49,320
I'll be riding the bench
half the season. I can be careful.

63
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,200
I know you can,
but what if there's an accident?

64
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,520
Look, Clark, I know this has gotta
be really hard for you...

65
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,640
...but hang in there like we promised.

66
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,680
I'm sick of hanging in there.

67
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,480
I just want to go through
school without being a loser.

68
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,400
I can't believe you bet against him.

69
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,600
If the clock moved
any slower, he'd be extinct.

70
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,320
Did you hear that?

71
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,040
- So, did anyone ask you to the dance?
- Not yet.

72
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,720
If nothing pans out, maybe you...

73
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,080
Take a break from your soap opera.
I'm not interested in Clark.

74
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,440
Your vehement denial has
been duly noted.

75
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,880
Maybe you and I could go.

76
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,280
Not as a date thing,
more of a friend thing.

77
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,120
Hi, guys.

78
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,120
Didn't you just...?
Weren't you...?

79
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,280
- I took a shortcut.
- Through a black hole?

80
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,680
You'll have to excuse our reporter.
Her "weirdar" is on Defcon 5.

81
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,160
She thought the bus was attacked.

82
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Just because everyone ignores
the strange things that go on...

83
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,880
...doesn't mean they don't happen.

84
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,240
We'd love to join you and
Scooby for another zany adventure...

85
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,000
...but we need to hand in these
slips before homeroom.

86
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,720
I'm having second thoughts.
I don't think it's a good idea.

87
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,400
This is the only way.

88
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,400
Wait. You two are trying
out for the football team?

89
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,360
What is this, some
sort of teen suicide pact?

90
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,040
We're trying to avoid
being a scarecrow.

91
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,120
What are you talking about,
and why the whispering?

92
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,480
It's tradition. Before the game,
the players pick a freshman...

93
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,800
...take him and paint
an ""S"" on his chest.

94
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,240
- String him up like a scarecrow.
- Sounds like years of therapy.

95
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,320
That's why we're trying out.

96
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,080
They won't choose one of their own.

97
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,160
- I'll see you guys in class.
- Bye.

98
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,120
- Give him 10 seconds.
- Five.

99
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,520
One, two, three, four, five.

100
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,000
Statistical fact.

101
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,040
He can't get within five feet of
Lana Lang...

102
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,640
...without turning into
a freak show.

103
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,880
Nietzsche.

104
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,840
Didn't realize you had
a dark side, Clark.

105
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,280
- Doesn't everybody?
- Yeah, I guess so.

106
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,000
So what are you, man or superman?

107
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,560
- Haven't figured it out yet.
- Lana. There you are.

108
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,760
Hey, Clark.

109
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,360
I was wondering if you
could do me a favour.

110
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,800
Could you check my English paper?
I didn't finish until 2.

111
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,200
- I'm not sure about the ending.
- I'll bet it's great.

112
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,200
Dude. Are you feeling all right?

113
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,840
- You look like you're about to hurl.
- I'm fine.

114
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,120
You forgot one, Clark.

115
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,840
Payback time.

116
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,320
Thanks, Dad.

117
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,040
Ready! Down! Set! Hike!

118
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,920
Red and gold no doubt
We're here to win one out

119
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
I knew you could do it, Clark.

120
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,520
Clark, Clark, Clark...

121
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,880
Clark! How do I look?

122
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,920
Like a tackle dummy.

123
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,800
Good luck.

124
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Come on, don't die on me!

125
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,000
I could've sworn I hit you.

126
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,040
If you did, I'd be...

127
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,880
I'd be dead.

128
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,800
Clark!

129
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,240
- Son, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

130
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,960
- Who's the maniac driving the car?
- That would be me.

131
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,640
Lex Luthor.

132
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,560
I'm Jonathan Kent. This is my son.

133
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,560
Thanks for saving my life.

134
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,560
I'm sure you'd have done the same.

135
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,560
You have an extraordinary boy.
If there's any way I can repay you...

136
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,120
Drive slower.

137
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,200
My aunt'll be back any minute.

138
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,320
Oh, come on!
We're living on the edge.

139
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,120
If Aunt Nell finds us here, your
life won't be worth living.

140
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,520
- Where is she anyway, bridge club?
- Lex Luthor's.

141
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,960
- I didn't know your aunt knew them.
- She sold them land.

142
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,640
They own the Metropolis Sharks.
She could put in a good word.

143
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,800
If you want a good word, ask Clark.

144
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,040
- He saved Lex's life today.
- You're kidding.

145
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,840
Sometimes people can surprise you.

146
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,000
I think it's kind of cool.

147
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,880
A scout from Kansas State
is coming Saturday.

148
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,440
That's great.

149
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,200
I don't want to be a ""Remember him?""

150
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,040
Smallville's got enough of those guys.

151
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,480
I want you to wear this to the game.

152
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,200
I can't take this.

153
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,000
You can give it back after you win.

154
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,360
Is it really made from a piece of the
meteor that, you know...?

155
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,400
So much bad luck came out of it...

156
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,120
...there can only be good luck left.

157
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,360
Jeez, kid! Scared the crap out of me.

158
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,960
Don't I know you?

159
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,440
You look like that scarecrow kid.
Where the hell you been?

160
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,520
Hey, Freakazoid, wake up.

161
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,000
That was 12 years ago, man.
That was just a game.

162
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,320
What do you want?

163
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,080
To play.

164
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,440
- Hey, Mom, whose truck?
- Yours.

165
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,560
It's a gift from Lex Luthor.

166
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,480
""Dear Clark: Drive safely.
Always in your debt...

167
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,400
...the maniac in the Porsche. ""

168
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,280
I don't believe it.
Where are the keys?

169
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,800
Your father has them.

170
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,360
I know how much you want it, son,
but you can't keep it.

171
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,920
- Why not? I saved his life.
- So you deserve a prize?

172
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,520
That's not what I meant.

173
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,280
You drive it, I'll use the old one.

174
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,640
- Everybody wins.
- It's not about winning, Clark.

175
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,480
It's not like the Luthors
can't afford it.

176
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,720
Do you know why that is?

177
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,320
Remember Mr. Bell?
We'd fish on his property.

178
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Mr. Guy? He sent us
pumpkins on Halloween.

179
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,280
Lionel Luthor promised to cut
them in on a deal.

180
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,920
He sent them flashy gifts.

181
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,680
Once they sold him their property...

182
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,120
...he evicted them.

183
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,720
You're judging Lex on what his
father did?

184
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,880
No, Clark, I'm not.

185
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,360
I want to make sure you know...

186
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,480
...where the money came from
that bought that truck.

187
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,920
Clark, I know you're upset, son,
but it's normal.

188
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,480
Normal?

189
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,240
How about this?
Is this normal?

190
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,800
I didn't dive in after Lex's car.
It hit me at 60 mph.

191
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,320
Does that sound normal to you?
I'd give anything to be normal.

192
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,680
It's time, son.

193
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,760
Time for what?

194
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,760
The truth.

195
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,400
I want you to take a look
at something.

196
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,320
I think it's from your parents.
Your real parents.

197
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,520
What does it say?

198
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,920
I tried to decipher it,
but it's not a language known to man.

199
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,560
What do you mean?

200
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:14,200
Your real parents weren't exactly
from around here.

201
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,440
Where are they from?

202
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,280
What are you trying to tell me?
I'm from another planet?

203
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,560
I suppose you stashed my
spaceship in the attic.

204
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,240
Actually, it's in the cellar.

205
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,760
This is how you came
into our world, son.

206
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,440
It was the day of the meteor shower.

207
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,440
This is a joke, right?

208
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,920
Why didn't you tell
me about this before?

209
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,200
- We wanted to protect you.
- Protect me from what?

210
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,320
You should have told me.

211
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,000
- Who's there?
- It's me.

212
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,840
- Clark.
- Clark Kent?

213
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,640
What are you doing
creeping around the woods?

214
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,440
You'd never believe me if I told you.

215
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,080
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

216
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,920
Clark, wait.

217
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,440
Just wasn't expecting
to see anyone out here.

218
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,920
Are you okay?

219
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,600
I'm hanging out in a graveyard.
Does that strike you as okay behaviour?

220
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,000
Hey, I'm here too.

221
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,680
Good point. What's your story?

222
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,800
Can you keep a secret?

223
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,200
I'm the Fort Knox of secrets.

224
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,360
I...

225
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,640
...came out here
to talk with my parents.

226
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,640
You must think I'm pretty weird,
conversing with dead people.

227
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,000
I don't think you're weird, Lana.

228
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,240
Do you remember them?

229
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,880
They died when I was 3.

230
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,600
I'm sorry.

231
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,920
It's not your fault, Clark.

232
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,640
Come on, I'll introduce you.

233
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,960
Mom, Dad?

234
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,520
This is Clark Kent.

235
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,920
Say hi.

236
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,320
Yeah, he is kind of shy.

237
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,520
How should I know?

238
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,320
Mom asks if you're upset about a girl.

239
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:33,040
- Dad asks if it's about a guy.
- No, no.

240
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,600
He has a twisted sense of humour.

241
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,200
Seriously, Clark.

242
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,400
Why are you out here?

243
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,400
Ever feel like your life was
supposed to be something different?

244
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,680
Sometimes I dream I'm at school,
waiting for Nell to pick me up.

245
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,520
But she doesn't come.

246
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,480
My parents drive up and they're
not dead, they're just really late.

247
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:10,640
I get in their car and we drive back
to my real life in Metropolis.

248
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,760
That's when I wake up.

249
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,320
And for a minute, I'm totally happy.

250
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,280
Until I realize I'm still alone.

251
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,880
What's that, Mrs. Lang?

252
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,720
Yeah, I'll tell her.

253
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,240
She wants you to know
you're not alone.

254
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:45,440
That she's always looking over you.
No matter what.

255
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,760
What's that, Mr. Lang?

256
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,160
He thinks you're in
for homecoming queen.

257
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,680
They really say all that?

258
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,360
Oh, they're quite chatty
once you get them started.

259
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,200
Thanks for walking me home.

260
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,600
Beats creeping around the woods.

261
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,400
You realize this is our longest
conversation ever?

262
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,920
We should do it again.

263
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,440
Yes, we should.

264
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,960
So, you going to the dance?

265
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,240
Yeah, with Whitney.

266
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,200
Right, of course.

267
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,400
How about you?

268
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,240
No, figured I'd sit it out.

269
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,720
If you change your mind...

270
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,720
...I might save you a dance.

271
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,840
Good night, Clark.

272
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,280
Hello?

273
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,480
Hello?

274
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,760
Clark?

275
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,000
I didn't see you.

276
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,120
I buzzed, but no one answered.

277
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,480
- How'd you get by the gate?
- Lf this is a bad time...

278
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,800
No, I think Heiki has sufficiently
kicked my ass for the day.

279
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,040
This is a great place.

280
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:17,560
- Lf you're dead and need it to haunt.
- I mean it's roomy.

281
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,680
It's the Luthor ancestral home.

282
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,840
So my father claims. He had it
shipped over from Scotland.

283
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,320
I remember trucks rolled in
for weeks. No one ever moved in.

284
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,200
He had no desire to live here.
He's never been here.

285
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,840
- Then why ship it over?
- Because he could.

286
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,600
How's the new ride?

287
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,920
That's why I'm here.

288
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,160
What's the matter?
You don't like it?

289
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,520
No, it's not that.
I can't keep it.

290
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,360
Clark, you saved my life.
It's the least I can do.

291
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,000
Your father doesn't like me.

292
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,520
It's okay. I've been
bald since I was 9.

293
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,400
- I'm used to people judging me.
- It's not personal.

294
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,280
He's just not crazy
about your dad.

295
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,200
Figures the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree?

296
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,080
Understandable.

297
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,080
What about you, Clark?

298
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,040
Did you fall far from the tree?

299
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,400
I'd better go.
Thanks for the truck.

300
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,640
Clark?

301
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,240
Do you believe a man can fly?

302
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,480
Sure, in a plane.

303
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,720
I'm not talking about that.

304
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,720
I'm talking about soaring
with the air beneath you.

305
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,000
- People can't fly, Lex.
- I did.

306
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,760
After the accident, when
my heart stopped.

307
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,240
It was the most exhilarating
two minutes of my life.

308
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,960
I flew over Smallville.

309
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,080
And for the first time...

310
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,080
...I didn't see a dead end.

311
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,160
I saw a new beginning.

312
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,600
Thanks to you,
I have a second chance.

313
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,640
We are the future, Clark.

314
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,280
Nothing will stand in
the way of our friendship.

315
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,960
- That's the third guy.
- And they're all former jocks.

316
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,320
- Who's the weirdo?
- I don't know.

317
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Let's check him out.

318
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,920
Jeremy Creek.
This is him 12 years ago.

319
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,840
- This I took four hours ago.
- That's impossible.

320
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,320
Must be a kid who looks like him.

321
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,680
I thought he was a twin,
until we checked this.

322
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,920
He left the state infirmary.

323
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,840
He'd been in a coma for years,
suffering from electrolyte imbalance.

324
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,040
- Hasn't aged a day.
- He just woke up?

325
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,480
There was a storm.

326
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,520
The hospital's generator
went down and Jeremy vanished.

327
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,880
Electricity charged him up.

328
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,800
He's back, putting former
jocks into comas. Why?

329
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,720
Because 12 years ago today, they chose
Jeremy Creek as the scarecrow.

330
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,160
""Comatose boy found 20
yards from meteor strike. ""

331
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,520
- The blast must have done something.
- No, this can't be right.

332
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,560
- I think you ought to show him.
- Show me what?

333
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,680
It started out as a
scrapbook and just mutated.

334
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,120
What is it?

335
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,440
I call it the Wall of Weird.

336
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,240
It's every strange event that's
happened due to the meteors.

337
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,480
That's when it all began.
The town went schizo.

338
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,240
- What do you think?
- Why didn't you tell me about this?

339
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:22,800
Do you tell me everything about
your life? We all keep secrets.

340
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,640
Lana?

341
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,440
My fault.

342
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,320
It's all my fault.

343
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,880
Chloe, just leave me alone.

344
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,960
Congratulations, Clark.
You're this year's scarecrow.

345
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,640
- Don't mess with me right now.
- Come on, bring it on!

346
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,160
- What's with you and Lana?
- Nothing.

347
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,040
Like her necklace? Huh?

348
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,320
Good, because it's as close
as you'll ever get to her.

349
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,560
Never changes.

350
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,240
Help me.

351
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,320
Hurts, doesn't it?

352
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,080
You're Jeremy.

353
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,480
I thought if I punished
them, it'd stop.

354
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,400
But it never stops.

355
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Wait.

356
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,680
Where are you going?

357
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,640
Homecoming dance.
I never made it to mine.

358
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,400
Get me down. Please?

359
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,760
You're safer here.

360
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,400
Help me.

361
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,000
Help me.

362
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,000
Clark?

363
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,320
Ah, jeez.

364
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,440
Who did this to you?

365
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,840
Doesn't matter.

366
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,720
You need to see a doctor.

367
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,360
- I'll be okay.
- At least let me give you a ride.

368
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,320
Jeremy, you need to stop this.

369
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,720
I don't know how you got here.

370
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,960
- You should have stayed away.
- I won't let you hurt my friends.

371
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,760
Those people aren't your friends.

372
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,440
The sprinklers will get them
nice and wet.

373
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,960
- They never did a thing to you.
- This isn't for me.

374
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
This is for others like us!

375
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,960
What happened to you was my fault.
I can understand your pain.

376
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,280
I'm not in pain.

377
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,280
I have a gift...

378
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,160
...a purpose and a destiny.

379
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,800
So do I.

380
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,160
Give it up, Jeremy.

381
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,120
Are you okay?

382
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,080
Who are you?

383
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,880
Where am I?

384
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,280
I'm Clark Kent,
and you're in Smallville.

385
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,080
I want to go home.

386
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,360
What is that?

387
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,040
Who did this to my truck?

388
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,640
The one on top.

389
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,880
That's cool.

390
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,480
Your grandfather gave me
that telescope...

391
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,160
...when I was about your age.

392
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:34,520
I came downstairs for breakfast
one day and there it was.

393
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,000
Are you okay?

394
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,040
Can I answer that
in about five years?

395
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,400
Yeah.

396
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,600
Dad.

397
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,680
I'm glad you and Mom found me.

398
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,520
We didn't find you, Clark.

399
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,840
You found us.

400
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,680
I didn't see you tonight, Clark.

401
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,560
Lana.

402
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,640
What are you doing here?

403
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,400
I saved you that dance.

404
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,280
Is everything okay, Clark?

405
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,440
It's perfect.

406
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,400
Thanks for the dance, Lana.
