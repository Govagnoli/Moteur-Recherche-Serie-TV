1
00:00:34,962 --> 00:00:38,721
You guys okay? You want a cracker
to help you put down?

2
00:00:39,888 --> 00:00:41,878
Com'on!
Let's go! Let's go!

3
00:00:42,528 --> 00:00:43,792
Drink.

4
00:01:04,345 --> 00:01:05,486
Oh!

5
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:13,411
Now, do you believe me?
This isn't suzy sorority you're playing with.

6
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:17,982
I've drunk vodka with russian generals,
black and tans with british battalion troops...

7
00:01:18,022 --> 00:01:19,760
stop talking.

8
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,728
Start drinking.

9
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:34,105
What are you doing, man?

10
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:35,976
I'm drinking.

11
00:01:36,027 --> 00:01:37,979
We've got physicals coming up.

12
00:01:38,637 --> 00:01:40,740
Ask me if I give a rat's ass.

13
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,774
Stop stalling, and let's go.
Drink up, or pay up.

14
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:47,328
All right, let's get everybody
out of here, all right?

15
00:01:47,383 --> 00:01:50,931
I got to wake up brutally early tomorrow.
The recruit's coming.

16
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,816
Dude, you've had enough.

17
00:01:57,866 --> 00:02:01,464
I'm not even tipsy.

18
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:23,411
Come on, let's get you into bed.

19
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:32,148
Deep breaths...

20
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:34,743
fresh air. The world is not spinning.

21
00:02:34,793 --> 00:02:36,869
Hey, wait up.

22
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,354
Shouldn't you be in pink
elephant land right about now?

23
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:43,333
I got another game for you.

24
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:45,944
Only this time, we both win.

25
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:48,505
Come on, give me some.

26
00:02:48,605 --> 00:02:52,108
I've got a game for you, football.
It's called hide-and-go seek.

27
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:54,769
You go hide, and I'll count to a billion.

28
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:56,945
Ready, set, go.

29
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,525
Aw, come on!
Don't be like that!

30
00:03:00,558 --> 00:03:03,286
You got a girlfriend,
bonehead. Go bug her.

31
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:04,491
Come on!

32
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:11,526
Now, don't you think hide-and-seek
would've been a little more fun?

33
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,518
That hurt.

34
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,405
Night-night, party boy.

35
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,808
Go away.

36
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:40,005
Please, god...

37
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:51,789
Whoever is pounding on a dorm room door
at 7:00 in the morning...

38
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:53,593
lois lane?

39
00:03:53,672 --> 00:03:55,241
Do you mind not talking so loud?

40
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,725
There's been a report that you had
an altercation last night with dave cooper.

41
00:03:57,803 --> 00:04:02,335
If "altercation" is defined as "jock attacks,
and I knock the wind out of him," yeah, I confess.

42
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:05,656
The boy is paralyzed.
You're under arrest.

43
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:17,431

www. forom. com

47
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:09,172
I realize I already gave you my blessing on this,
clark, and I don't want to lie to you.

48
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:11,482
This whole thing
makes me feel uneasy.

49
00:05:11,515 --> 00:05:14,201
Dad, we've been watching met U.
Football games since I can remember.

50
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,526
Now they're knocking on my door.

51
00:05:15,587 --> 00:05:17,997
I know that, and I'm proud of you for it.

52
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:21,177
Then why can't I have a shot at what every other
high school kid dreams of?

53
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:23,487
Because you're not like every
other high school kid, clark.

54
00:05:23,537 --> 00:05:24,842
On that field I am.

55
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:28,709
I'm not even using my abilities... and I can be
the new starting quarterback for the metropolis bulldogs.

56
00:05:28,764 --> 00:05:31,861
There's gonna be millions of eyes on you.
You're gonna be under a magnifying glass.

57
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:33,467
I have pulled it off before.

58
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:34,471
Clark,

59
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:38,658
met U. Is not like smallville high.

60
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,687
It's a much bigger stage.
There's gonna be much bigger problems.

61
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:45,458
You always told me not to walk away
from something just because it's a challenge.

62
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:49,073
Dad, I can do this.

63
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,455
I know that you can handle it.

64
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:56,676
I also know you'll behave yourself this weekend...
stay clear of the beer kegs.

65
00:05:56,743 --> 00:05:58,668
Don't worry. Alcohol can't
affect me, remember?

66
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,501
That's not the point.
You're still underage.

67
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,783
Look, son, I just don't want you
to get booted out before you get in.

68
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,071
- All right?
- Okay.

69
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:10,644
Now, there's one more thing.

70
00:06:10,695 --> 00:06:12,803
It's very important.

71
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,586
This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

72
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:17,377
Have a great time.

73
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:19,704
Clark kent...

74
00:06:20,122 --> 00:06:22,654
future met U. Hall of famer?

75
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,299
Hey.

76
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:28,160
What's the teflon tailback
doing back in town?

77
00:06:28,218 --> 00:06:29,641
Hey, mr. Kent.

78
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:32,056
Coach calloway wanted to surprise clark,

79
00:06:32,106 --> 00:06:34,148
send a local boy to pick him up.

80
00:06:34,181 --> 00:06:39,386
Well, it definitely worked. I would've never expected to see
the bulldogs' all-time leading rusher in my barn.

81
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,821
Hey, I'm no different than you, clark. I'm just...

82
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:44,152
a farm boy who happens
to be a decent football player.

83
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,803
"Decent football player".

84
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:49,440
You're on your way to the nfl,
and you're quite the legend at smallville high.

85
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,428
Yeah, well,your boy broke my record
for single season T.D.S.

86
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:55,052
Yeah...

87
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,311
You got what it takes, clark.

88
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:00,144
You really think so?

89
00:07:00,194 --> 00:07:01,851
I know so.

90
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:05,567
You got a heckuva ride a head of you,
but the thing that's gonna keep you level-headed

91
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,094
is remembering where you come from...

92
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:10,535
like smallville high.

93
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:12,878
You wanna go say hi to coach quigley?

94
00:07:12,928 --> 00:07:13,982
Sure.

95
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:24,681
He was no prince charming,
but nobody deserves to have that happen to them.

96
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:27,393
He can't even speak.
I feel terrible.

97
00:07:27,443 --> 00:07:33,219
Lois, it doesn't take an M.D. to know that a kick
to the gut is not gonna cause head-to-toe paralysis.

98
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:37,420
I hope the judge agrees. Otherwise, I'm gonna be
the star of my very own woman in prison movie.

99
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,161
How did you post bail?

100
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:43,985
Four very good friends of mine...
visa, mastercard, american express, and discover.

101
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:46,379
Chloe, I didn't know where else to go.

102
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:50,051
And lucky for you,I'm on my way to met U.
For my financial aid pitch.

103
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:53,245
Why don't we just, um,round-trip together,
and we'll figure this thing out?

104
00:07:53,296 --> 00:07:55,204
Lois, I heard what happened.

105
00:07:55,254 --> 00:07:57,385
I see news travels fast.

106
00:07:57,451 --> 00:07:59,560
The guy you put in the hospital

107
00:07:59,627 --> 00:08:01,133
is geoff's roommate.

108
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:06,213
Clark, I swear to god, all I did was knock the wind
out of him. I couldn't have paralyzed him.

109
00:08:06,263 --> 00:08:07,936
You were drinking, right?

110
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:12,706
Those days are over. No more alcohol.
And that includes cough syrup and rum cakes.

111
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:16,243
Aspirin, anyone?

112
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,356
"Torch" desk drawer on the left-hand side.

113
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:25,367
Listen, chloe, I know that we were supposed to
drive to met U. Today, but since geoff is here,

114
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:29,986
I understand. Star quarterback...
you don't wanna ride with the common folk.

115
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:31,526
You know
it's not like that

116
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:32,580
It's fine, clark.

117
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:35,364
Hey, uh, clark,

118
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:38,677
I'm actually kind of surprised
that you took the football route.

119
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:41,205
Why?

120
00:08:41,322 --> 00:08:42,426
Well...

121
00:08:42,987 --> 00:08:46,552
I don't know, it just seems like you have kind of
an unfair advantage.

122
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:51,498
What do you mean?

123
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,929
Well, you have all of
these truly amazing talents,

124
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,808
um, you know,on the field...

125
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,541
well, you know, that's the way it is in sports.
Some people are betterthan others.

126
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:05,704
Right.

127
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:09,675
I guess I just don't understand
as much as I thought I did.

128
00:09:11,148 --> 00:09:12,721
About football.

129
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:14,596
Chloe...

130
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:18,524
let's go, C.K.
The festivities are about to begin.

131
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,478
I take it you've contemplated my job offer.

132
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:33,319
It wasn't a hard decision to make.

133
00:09:33,888 --> 00:09:38,122
I forgot to mention, a company car is included
as well as a generous expense account.

134
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:42,213
I'm not gonna work for somebody whose
mission it is is to break me and my girlfriend up.

135
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:45,125
Jason...

136
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:49,142
my only concern is lana's welfare.

137
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:53,365
But you're not the threat
I'm worried about.

138
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:56,036
It's your mother.

139
00:09:57,626 --> 00:10:04,622
Did you ever find it strange that every summer as a child
she took you on treks to the far reaches of the globe?

140
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,810
Destinations where there
wasn't even running water.

141
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:10,572
My mother likes to travel.
She always has.

142
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,664
Those weren't vacations, Jason.

143
00:10:12,848 --> 00:10:15,208
They were research trips...

144
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:19,807
investigating a woman
who was burned at the stake 400 years ago.

145
00:10:21,175 --> 00:10:23,038
Margaret isabelle theroux?

146
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:26,882
The countess whose spirit
possessed your girlfriend.

147
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:31,910
And the fact that it happened soon after you
and your mother came into lana's life, well...

148
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,537
that bothers me.

149
00:10:33,588 --> 00:10:35,056
That bothers me a lot.

150
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:37,152
I had nothing to do with that.

151
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:40,165
I would never put lana in jeopardy.

152
00:10:40,215 --> 00:10:43,864
And I believe you,
or I wouldn't offer you this job.

153
00:10:44,232 --> 00:10:46,767
What exactly is it that you want me to do?

154
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:52,976
I have deep pockets,jason.

155
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,998
Vast resources.
But the one thing I don't have is access.

156
00:10:58,969 --> 00:11:03,873
Two women in your life are somehow intimately
connected to margaret isabelle theroux.

157
00:11:04,124 --> 00:11:07,152
I want you to find out everything they know.

158
00:11:08,056 --> 00:11:10,383
So, what, you want me to spy on them?

159
00:11:11,286 --> 00:11:14,349
How you get the information is up to you.

160
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:20,158
Now I need an answer.

161
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:32,969
Coop.

162
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:35,396
Can you hear me?

163
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:42,077
It's lois,
your, um, drinking buddy.

164
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:48,241
I am so sorry this happened to you,
but I swear to god, I didn't do it.

165
00:11:52,308 --> 00:11:56,503
Last night, I would've given anything
to shut him up. And now...

166
00:11:56,989 --> 00:12:01,072
come on, lois. We gotta get outta
here before someone sees you.

167
00:12:02,818 --> 00:12:06,316
Maybe someone close to coop
knows something we don'T.

168
00:12:07,086 --> 00:12:08,693
Lois, I...

169
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:14,036
I don't think that grandma betty from topeka
is gonna have the answer.

170
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:17,160
But his girlfriend monique might.

171
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:18,917
How do you know it's his girlfriend?

172
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:23,084
When the card ends with "I'll love you forever
and ever," it's a bit of a giveaway.

173
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:27,547
The girls of Alpha Alpha Alpha
Hope you get well soon!

174
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:40,208
This truck looks likeit can do everything
but take off and fly.

175
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,702
Hey, check it out. You hit this button...

176
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:48,282
the operator's there to help you out with whatever you need...
atm locations, movie times, you name it.

177
00:12:48,482 --> 00:12:49,989
That's pretty cool.

178
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,102
Yeah, I hear next year's model is even sweeter.

179
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:55,830
Unless you want something sportier.

180
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,240
What, you're saying I get a truck like this
if I come here to play?

181
00:13:00,859 --> 00:13:05,529
Let's just say certain alumni are nice enough
to loan their athletes rides.

182
00:13:08,082 --> 00:13:11,178
Clark, college football is big business.

183
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,760
I mean, you get a lot,
but they expect a lot in return.

184
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:17,203
You have to be better than good.

185
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:21,461
You have to be a hero out there.

186
00:13:30,086 --> 00:13:33,199
Yeah, I thought you might want to see
where you're gonna be spending your saturdays.

187
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:55,811
Clark kent, quarterback
he's a bulldog, that's a fact

188
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:58,075
Clark kent, quarterback...

189
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,300
Ladies and gentlemen, playing quarterback
for your metropolis bulldogs,

190
00:14:02,311 --> 00:14:06,445
from smallville, kansas...
number 8, clark kent!

191
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:08,324
It's pretty cool, huh?

192
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:12,299
That's an understatement.
Get used to it, buddy. It's just the beginning.

193
00:14:12,358 --> 00:14:15,069
The golden arm of kansas has arrived.
It's a pleasure to meet you, son.

194
00:14:15,102 --> 00:14:16,793
Coach, it's a pleasure to meet you.

195
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:19,498
I know a lot of other schools
are coming at you, clark.

196
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:22,744
But you go with met U.,
And you're gonna win a national championship.

197
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:24,502
Sounds good to me.

198
00:14:24,753 --> 00:14:26,527
Try this on for size.

199
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:28,072
Coach,

200
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:29,327
thanks.

201
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,076
I know you're gonna make
the right decision, son.

202
00:14:36,624 --> 00:14:39,275
Clark, gary bergen... metro motors.

203
00:14:39,325 --> 00:14:43,175
On behalf of the bulldog booster club,
welcome to met U.

204
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:48,078
If there is anything that you need,
you know where to call.

205
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:55,434
Everybody wants a winning team, clark...

206
00:14:55,468 --> 00:14:57,828
it's guys like me and you
that make it happen.

207
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:00,941
Waw, this is amazing.

208
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:04,104
Dude, you haven't seen nothing yet.

209
00:15:10,922 --> 00:15:12,462
Hi, clark!

210
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:16,696
The tri alphas are big football fans.

211
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:18,136
Yeah?

212
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:24,421
So, we did a little detective work and found out
that your favorite flavor was chocolate.

213
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:26,513
So we made you cake.

214
00:15:26,547 --> 00:15:29,509
Why, you didn't have to go
through all that trouble.

215
00:15:29,543 --> 00:15:33,414
Anything we can do to help you
commit to met U., Clark.

216
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:36,711
How about a tour of the house?

217
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:43,815
Go ahead, C.K. Take your time.

218
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:46,008
I'll see you back at the dorm.

219
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,421
So you two roommates?

220
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:57,446
Um... no.

221
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,676
My roommate's on her way
to visit coop at the hospital.

222
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,389
He's her boyfriend.

223
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:05,719
Clark?

224
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:08,062
From what we hear...

225
00:16:08,882 --> 00:16:11,348
not only do you have an incredible arm,

226
00:16:11,398 --> 00:16:13,641
you've got great hands.

227
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:18,746
Really?
Somebody said that to you about me?

228
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:20,960
Clark...

229
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:24,776
um, you've got a great view out this window.

230
00:16:24,826 --> 00:16:27,956
Yeah,
if you like brick walls.

231
00:16:29,634 --> 00:16:33,450
Let me show you
an even better view.

232
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:37,935
I meant the ivy.

233
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,438
What was that?

234
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:49,003
Let me go check it out.

235
00:16:58,178 --> 00:17:00,187
Uh... some sweaters fell down...

236
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:01,710
in there.

237
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:04,304
Um, could I... could I get something to drink?

238
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,726
Um...

239
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:08,174
yeah. Sure.

240
00:17:13,418 --> 00:17:15,259
And maybe something to eat?

241
00:17:21,871 --> 00:17:23,566
Lois, what are you doing here?

242
00:17:23,784 --> 00:17:25,742
I could ask you the same question,

243
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:27,851
but it seems fairly obvious... hef.

244
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:30,144
What, you just break
into people's places now?

245
00:17:30,194 --> 00:17:32,961
Coop's girlfriend wasn't here,so I thought
I'd take a look around.

246
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:37,178
A real page-turner.
"I gained two pounds. From now on, it's no carbs. "

247
00:17:37,229 --> 00:17:38,835
She's no hemingway, but still...

248
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:40,409
I don't have timefor this.

249
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:41,786
Here it is.

250
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:46,338
"Coop is meeting witha newspaper reporter
and being super-secretive.

251
00:17:46,372 --> 00:17:50,222
"It has something to do with the football
team, but I don't know what it is. "

252
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:53,619
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

253
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:02,085
Hey, Clark...

254
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:04,922
would you like a piece of this?

255
00:18:10,064 --> 00:18:10,934
Hi.

256
00:18:27,814 --> 00:18:29,136
Hey, buddy.

257
00:18:29,186 --> 00:18:30,737
Feeling better?

258
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:38,871
I see it's starting to wear off.

259
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:51,103
Eventually, you're gonna be able to talk.

260
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,808
And when you do,

261
00:18:54,143 --> 00:18:56,586
you're gonna tell the world about me...

262
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:59,799
like you were gonna do before I stopped you.

263
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:34,576
I'm sorry, coop.

264
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:00,266
I thought I told you to wait outside.

265
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:05,153
I don't do well with waiting, especially when I'm awaiting trial.
I want to hear what geoff knows.

266
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:06,860
Speaking of geoff...

267
00:20:08,735 --> 00:20:09,883
hey.

268
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:15,205
You've, uh, met my friend lois.

269
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:19,339
Coach just called.

270
00:20:22,474 --> 00:20:24,265
Coop's dead, clark.

271
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:28,064
Oh, my god.

272
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:31,110
When?

273
00:20:31,344 --> 00:20:32,963
An hour ago.

274
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:36,126
His vitals were getting better, and then

275
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:39,445
the doctor said he just stopped breathing.

276
00:20:40,415 --> 00:20:46,524
Look, geoff, we know coop was going to the newspaper
about something involving the football team.

277
00:20:46,568 --> 00:20:48,359
Lois, I don't think this is the best time...

278
00:20:48,392 --> 00:20:51,606
and when would be the best time, clark...
when I'm on the chain gang?

279
00:20:52,141 --> 00:20:54,200
I'm sorry. She's under a lot of stress lately.

280
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,427
No. Stress is when you're stuck in traffic,
or you have a midterm for a class you've never been to.

281
00:20:59,477 --> 00:21:03,745
I'm out on bail,
and looking to be locked up for manslaughter.

282
00:21:06,318 --> 00:21:08,111
Clark, can I talk to you for a second?

283
00:21:08,163 --> 00:21:09,305
Look...

284
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:12,223
I'm sorry about coop.

285
00:21:12,273 --> 00:21:13,751
I really am.

286
00:21:14,236 --> 00:21:17,416
But if you have something to say about me,
say it to my face,

287
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:20,283
because I have this little pet peeve
about people talking behind my back.

288
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:21,689
Lois...

289
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:23,681
please.

290
00:21:25,008 --> 00:21:26,682
I'll catch up with you later.

291
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:40,982
I can't tell you how to pick your friends, clark,
but that chick seems like trouble.

292
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:42,572
I'm starting to figure that out.

293
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:45,283
Yeah, it's probably best if you tell her
not to come around here.

294
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,118
She's done enough damage already.

295
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,069
I can't believe that you would even consider
working for him.

296
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:00,479
- It's not that black and white.
- I think it is.

297
00:22:00,546 --> 00:22:03,865
Investigating the countess theroux? It's all a ruse.

298
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:07,915
Lana, the more lex uses me, the more I get to use
him and find out what he really knows.

299
00:22:07,965 --> 00:22:12,974
But that's just more secrets and more lies,
and at some point, it's all gonna blow up in our faces.

300
00:22:13,024 --> 00:22:17,665
Well, unfortunately,when dealing with people like lex
and my mother, honesty isn't necessarily the way to go.

301
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:20,459
It doesn't matter. I am done lying.

302
00:22:20,526 --> 00:22:22,224
I can't go along with this.

303
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:26,986
We've hit a brick wall. Our research with the countess
is going nowhere. This might be our way of breaking through.

304
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,217
Or their way of breaking us up.

305
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:33,640
I'm not gonna let that happen.

306
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:37,104
Trust me.

307
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,719
How can I trust someone
who's willing to lie for a living?

308
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:49,731
As far as I'm concerned,
if you think that lex knows something,

309
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:52,234
then there's only one way to find out.

310
00:22:59,749 --> 00:23:02,326
Who the hell do you think you are?

311
00:23:02,376 --> 00:23:03,875
Is something bothering you, lana?

312
00:23:03,908 --> 00:23:06,285
If you wanna know something about me, lex? Ask.

313
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:10,803
Don't go recruiting my boyfriend...
to conduct some covert investigation.

314
00:23:10,854 --> 00:23:14,457
Contrary to what you may think,
I'm on your side.

315
00:23:14,508 --> 00:23:17,922
And how would I know that?
With you, everything seems like it's a secret.

316
00:23:17,972 --> 00:23:20,812
What you may perceive as secrecy,
I see as precautions.

317
00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:24,042
I'm a big girl, lex. I don't need precautions.

318
00:23:24,076 --> 00:23:25,833
I need the truth.

319
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:30,904
Sometimes, we think we want the truth
until we actually get it.

320
00:23:31,747 --> 00:23:36,165
Lana, if you want me to be honest with you,
I will, but you're not gonna like it.

321
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:40,835
If you're gonna feed me some story about jason,

322
00:23:40,935 --> 00:23:42,709
I'm not interested.

323
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:46,908
Look, I understand he means a lot to you,

324
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:49,212
but when you're ready to talk,

325
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:51,159
let me know.

326
00:23:53,485 --> 00:23:55,276
You can let yourself out.

327
00:24:03,906 --> 00:24:06,785
Coop was more than just a great football player.

328
00:24:06,952 --> 00:24:08,479
He was a great guy.

329
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:11,257
He cared a lot about

330
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:14,136
what was right
and what was wrong.

331
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:17,031
Well... to coop.

332
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,812
- To Coop!
- To Coop!

333
00:24:19,816 --> 00:24:22,410
Well, he would've wanted a party, so...

334
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:24,770
let's give him a party.

335
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:28,356
You're not drinking?

336
00:24:28,624 --> 00:24:30,683
What's the matter?
You never had a beer before?

337
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,674
Sure I have.

338
00:24:33,327 --> 00:24:36,792
Yeah, right.
I know where you're coming from, C.K.

339
00:24:37,672 --> 00:24:39,999
But all that's gonna change.

340
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:53,172
Don't you think you should slow down a little bit?

341
00:25:00,687 --> 00:25:03,616
Kent, you're from the same town as me, so...

342
00:25:04,854 --> 00:25:06,946
I'm gonna be straight with you.

343
00:25:07,804 --> 00:25:11,788
Being a bulldog is a dream come true,
but you're in the pressure cooker now.

344
00:25:11,838 --> 00:25:13,930
All they want is a winner.

345
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,846
It takes a toll on you.

346
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:27,744
Um...

347
00:25:28,665 --> 00:25:30,878
Sit tight. Be right back, okay?

348
00:25:39,263 --> 00:25:42,135
I told you before, Marcus
we meet in private.

349
00:25:42,185 --> 00:25:43,741
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm bringing the urine sample by.

350
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:45,917
Oh, that's a great idea,
bring it to my buddy's wake.

351
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,373
Well, you said you were gonna pay me today.

352
00:25:47,423 --> 00:25:50,374
I told you, never come to me.
I come to you.

353
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,717
- We'll meet tomorrow.
- You said you'd pay me today, man.

354
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:54,876
I need my money.

355
00:26:03,132 --> 00:26:04,689
Just... just get out of here.

356
00:26:04,722 --> 00:26:06,295
What just happened to me?

357
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:10,138
I don't know, man. You fell over or something.
I don't know. Don't worry about it.

358
00:26:16,514 --> 00:26:18,540
Drink up, kent.

359
00:26:18,972 --> 00:26:20,294
To coop.

360
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,999
Chloe, if you're trying to milk any money out of this university,
you may not want to be seen within 100 feet of me.

361
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:38,087
Lois, you're innocent, and this autopsy
is more than likely going to prove that.

362
00:26:39,543 --> 00:26:41,499
Your father's birth city?

363
00:26:41,565 --> 00:26:44,662
What, are you applying for financial aid
or to the C.I.A.?

364
00:26:44,712 --> 00:26:45,716
I know.

365
00:26:46,737 --> 00:26:48,729
Hey, clark. Is something wrong?

366
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:53,166
I think geoff johns paralyzed coop.

367
00:26:53,217 --> 00:26:54,304
What?

368
00:26:54,355 --> 00:26:57,936
He's passing his physicals
by using another student's urine samples.

369
00:26:57,987 --> 00:27:00,866
Black market pee? What's he trying to cover up...

370
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:02,021
drugs?

371
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:06,054
I don't think so.
I think it's something else.

372
00:27:06,629 --> 00:27:10,144
I just saw him touch this kid, and he put him straight
to the ground like he hit him with a stun gun.

373
00:27:10,194 --> 00:27:13,173
And the linebackers... they always say
when they get stiff-armed by geoff jones,

374
00:27:13,228 --> 00:27:15,521
they don't know what hit them.
They go down to the turf every time.

375
00:27:15,588 --> 00:27:18,065
I think he has a meteor power.

376
00:27:18,918 --> 00:27:24,314
Using your powers on the field to cheat...
it's pathetic, but it's not paralyzing someone.

377
00:27:24,397 --> 00:27:27,159
What if he can control the intensity
when he stuns people?

378
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:30,255
If that's true, you're gonna have to
find a way to prove it, because...

379
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:35,703
nobody outside the smallville city limits is going to
believe the bulldog superstar has superhuman powers.

380
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:38,046
The pee peddler may know the truth about geoff.

381
00:27:38,096 --> 00:27:40,355
- Can you track him down?
- Yeah.

382
00:27:40,406 --> 00:27:45,131
I'm gonna go to the football dorm.
I'm gonna try to find geoff before he can hurt someone else.

383
00:27:56,186 --> 00:27:58,245
Time to see what mr. Peebody knows.

384
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:02,835
I'm gonna go door-to-door in the dorm
and see if I can get any insight into the real geoff johns.

385
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,494
Excuse me.

386
00:28:10,013 --> 00:28:13,946
Do you know where a person
can get some clean number one around here?

387
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,176
I don't know what you're talking about.

388
00:28:17,711 --> 00:28:21,757
Don't play dumb with me, pee-wee. Either you tell
me everything you know about geoff johns, or...

389
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:23,983
you wanna know about me?

390
00:28:24,987 --> 00:28:27,464
Ask away...
Get lost Marcus.

391
00:28:27,522 --> 00:28:29,279
Um, I'm just curious,

392
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:32,347
do you think you're gonna be drafted
to the sharks? 'Cause I'm a huge fan.

393
00:28:32,397 --> 00:28:34,422
So why are you talking to marcus?

394
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:37,201
What do you really want to know?

395
00:28:37,268 --> 00:28:40,239
Nothing, I swear.
Just what I asked you.

396
00:28:40,406 --> 00:28:43,904
I guess I'm gonna have to wait
and see like everyone else. Bye.

397
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,045
Look, I never wanted to use my powers.

398
00:28:58,066 --> 00:29:01,534
In high school,
I played ball fair and square, but now,

399
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,898
there's just...
too much pressure to win.

400
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:30,534
Lois!

401
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:33,597
I need your pass to get in the dorm!

402
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,488
Lois?

403
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:44,432
Lois!

404
00:29:55,163 --> 00:29:56,352
Lois.

405
00:30:01,506 --> 00:30:02,565
Clark,

406
00:30:02,632 --> 00:30:04,679
clark, I think geoff has lois.

407
00:30:04,746 --> 00:30:06,037
- Where?
- I don't know, but...

408
00:30:06,141 --> 00:30:10,939
we were in the parking lot, and the next thing I knew,
geoff johns' car is flying by, and lois is gone.

409
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:14,202
I tried to talk to the campus police,
but they weren't any help. To them,

410
00:30:14,274 --> 00:30:16,873
geoff is like a hero.
They worship the ground he walks on.

411
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,781
Lois could be anywhere by now, clark.

412
00:30:18,831 --> 00:30:21,241
No, if they're in his car,
there might be a way to track them down.

413
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:24,522
I hate to break it to you,
but this is a little bit bigger city than smallville.

414
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:28,176
He got his car from a booster at metropolis motors.
It's got a trip star system in it.

415
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:32,661
If we can get the P.I.N. Number, we can useyour cell phone
and computer to maybe hack in and find out where they are.

416
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:34,975
Okay, but then how are we
gonna get the P.I.N.?

417
00:30:35,026 --> 00:30:38,306
They keep those things under lock
and key at the dealership.

418
00:30:38,356 --> 00:30:41,586
What are you gonna do... break in and rip open the safe?

419
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,977
Of course not.

420
00:31:27,445 --> 00:31:29,001
Don't worry.

421
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:31,679
It'll be quick.

422
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:38,895
I'm so sorry.
I... I never meant to hurt anyone.

423
00:31:41,489 --> 00:31:43,531
But I don't have a choice.

424
00:32:09,162 --> 00:32:10,434
- Are we in yet?
- Yeah,

425
00:32:10,467 --> 00:32:15,254
all we gotta do is dial up, use the code,
and do our best impression of geoff johns.

426
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:22,920
You know, that was, um,
a pretty quick errand, clark.

427
00:32:22,953 --> 00:32:25,932
I mean, metro motors is all the way
on the other side of the city.

428
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:27,371
I hurried.

429
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:33,477
Hello, mr. Johns.
How can I help you?

430
00:32:33,527 --> 00:32:35,535
Hello. Hi, um...

431
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:39,134
I'm driving in metropolis, and I seem
to have made a wrong turn. There's no...

432
00:32:39,184 --> 00:32:43,188
street signs, and my map screen is broken.
Could you tell me where I am?

433
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:44,678
No problem, sir. One moment.

434
00:32:45,983 --> 00:32:48,828
- You're at 3rd and grand. Have a ni...
- Thank you.

435
00:32:48,895 --> 00:32:52,594
great, all right, let's go, I'll drive.

436
00:32:53,342 --> 00:32:54,530
Clark?

437
00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:28,499
Why isn't it working?

438
00:33:28,527 --> 00:33:29,935
Tell me where she is!

439
00:33:29,985 --> 00:33:31,541
It was never supposed to be like this, clark.

440
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,679
Where is she?!

441
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,839
I never even used my powers in high school,
but when I came to college,

442
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:39,554
I had to win so bad, I started.
I couldn't stop.

443
00:33:44,793 --> 00:33:46,333
Geoff, listen to me.

444
00:33:46,388 --> 00:33:50,209
You have to tell me where she is.
You don't want to murder another person.

445
00:33:50,254 --> 00:33:56,196
Coop was gonna tell the world that teflon tailback
was some kind of freak cheating his way into the record books.

446
00:33:56,255 --> 00:33:58,732
I couldn't let him do that.

447
00:33:59,385 --> 00:34:01,276
Tell me where she is.

448
00:34:01,946 --> 00:34:03,251
Please...

449
00:34:05,025 --> 00:34:07,239
She's down there.

450
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,853
Lois!

451
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,989
Lois!

452
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,148
Lois?

453
00:34:40,634 --> 00:34:41,939
Lois!

454
00:34:42,575 --> 00:34:44,371
Lois, can you hear me?

455
00:34:45,933 --> 00:34:46,887
Clark...

456
00:34:46,954 --> 00:34:49,230
Okay, we're going to be okay.

457
00:34:56,247 --> 00:34:57,952
Is lois going to be okay?

458
00:34:58,003 --> 00:35:02,622
Luckily, the paralysis wears off.
She's already been released from the hospital.

459
00:35:02,873 --> 00:35:04,547
Who would've thought?

460
00:35:04,614 --> 00:35:06,778
Geoff johns seemed like such a nice kid.

461
00:35:06,828 --> 00:35:11,648
Yeah, if I take this football scholarship,
I'm going to be in the same situation as geoff.

462
00:35:12,268 --> 00:35:15,280
I'm gonna have to lie on every physical...

463
00:35:15,354 --> 00:35:17,212
rig every test.

464
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:21,446
I'm gonna have to do anything I can
to protect my secret.

465
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:26,246
I want to believe that I can go out there
and play football like any normal college kid,

466
00:35:26,296 --> 00:35:29,777
but the fact is, I have powers
that no other athlete has.

467
00:35:31,049 --> 00:35:32,756
Coop was right.

468
00:35:32,873 --> 00:35:35,216
It's not fair that geoff was
out there on that field,

469
00:35:35,283 --> 00:35:38,116
just like it's not fair
when I'm out there competing.

470
00:35:41,263 --> 00:35:43,690
So I've decided to give up football.

471
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,579
Clark...

472
00:35:51,097 --> 00:35:54,947
I know how difficult it is
to give up something you love.

473
00:35:54,997 --> 00:35:58,386
But this decision you've made,
son, shows...

474
00:35:58,453 --> 00:36:01,533
integrity well beyond your years.

475
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,533
Then why don't I feel good about it?

476
00:36:15,043 --> 00:36:16,734
Look at me, clark.

477
00:36:18,006 --> 00:36:22,337
If you have your heart set on going to met U.
Or any other school,

478
00:36:23,626 --> 00:36:27,793
somehow, someway, your mother and
I will make sure that you get to go.

479
00:36:28,596 --> 00:36:30,341
Is that understood?

480
00:36:36,918 --> 00:36:38,190
Yeah.

481
00:36:40,469 --> 00:36:41,824
Good.

482
00:36:47,464 --> 00:36:51,684
This photograph of jason and his mother
was taken in paris...

483
00:36:51,818 --> 00:36:54,295
a day before he met you.

484
00:36:58,479 --> 00:37:01,329
No, that can't be.
His mom was in the hamptons.

485
00:37:01,379 --> 00:37:06,183
Look, lana, I'm not gonna be so presumptuous
as to judge jason's integrity,

486
00:37:06,233 --> 00:37:08,342
but I'll lay out a few facts.

487
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:14,356
Genevieve teague has been researching
the countess since before jason was born.

488
00:37:14,741 --> 00:37:21,277
He grew up in a housefull of ancient artifacts and reams
of research material about margaret isabelle theroux.

489
00:37:21,327 --> 00:37:22,716
He never told me that.

490
00:37:22,766 --> 00:37:24,942
Contrary to what you may think,

491
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:28,473
jason's been aware of the countess
since he was a child.

492
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:33,544
No.

493
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:35,988
No, I don't believe that.

494
00:37:36,055 --> 00:37:38,348
You have to ask yourself, lana,

495
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:43,092
how well do you really
know jason teague?

496
00:37:54,578 --> 00:37:58,026
Knock knock! You should think about
putting up a door or something.

497
00:37:58,076 --> 00:38:02,896
I don't know, maybe it's a city thing,
but where I come from, we like to have a little privacy.

498
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:06,521
Lois, who would've thought that
I'd be relieved to hear your voice?

499
00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:08,178
Look, clark,

500
00:38:08,228 --> 00:38:10,387
I don't know how you did it, but

501
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:14,541
if it weren'tfor you, I'd be at the bottom
of the mississippi right about now.

502
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,882
Thanks.

503
00:38:16,033 --> 00:38:19,480
I'm just glad you're okay
and going back to school.

504
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,885
That's not entirely true.

505
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:25,015
I kind of got punted out of the university.

506
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:27,475
I thought you were cleared of all charges.

507
00:38:27,525 --> 00:38:30,509
Oh, I was, but...
see, the thing is,I am

508
00:38:30,576 --> 00:38:33,204
still busted
for the booze,and, well...

509
00:38:33,254 --> 00:38:37,003
that wasn't the first time I've been invited
to the disciplinary board's kangaroo court.

510
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:39,086
Why am I not surprised?

511
00:38:39,258 --> 00:38:40,765
You heading back to the barracks?

512
00:38:40,815 --> 00:38:45,535
Not an option. My dad's trying out the tough love
approach with an emphasis on "tough. "

513
00:38:45,601 --> 00:38:47,911
So are you gonna go stay with chloe?

514
00:38:48,229 --> 00:38:51,247
They've got a tiny one-bedroom apartment.
I can't do that to them.

515
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,058
It's fine, really.
I'm just gonna check into a motel,

516
00:38:54,544 --> 00:38:59,741
and when the money runs out,I can always sleep in my car. The back
seat's not too bad if you bend your knees and avoid the drive train and

517
00:38:59,775 --> 00:39:00,375
Lois...

518
00:39:00,411 --> 00:39:05,365
you know, if I haveto sell my car for food,
that's okay, too. I've always dreamed of

519
00:39:05,415 --> 00:39:09,725
being a hobo, riding the rails,
cooking beans over roadside fires...

520
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:13,943
if you want, I guess you could stay with us.

521
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,608
You're a lifesaver.
God. Am I in need of a hot shower.

522
00:39:18,545 --> 00:39:22,200
Don't worry, smallville.
I'll try to keep it under a half-hour.

523
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,639
What just happened?

524
00:39:41,311 --> 00:39:42,618
Hey!

525
00:39:42,818 --> 00:39:46,015
Looks like you've got a carpool buddy
for weekenders back to smallville.

526
00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:47,488
You got into met U.?

527
00:39:47,538 --> 00:39:50,601
The financial guy said that it's pretty much a lock.
Can you believe it?

528
00:39:50,651 --> 00:39:52,346
Now I don't actually have to rob banks.

529
00:39:52,397 --> 00:39:54,606
Oh, chloe, congratulations.
You deserve it.

530
00:39:54,656 --> 00:39:58,706
Thank you. You just have to promise me one thing...
that once you're everybody's all-american,

531
00:39:58,773 --> 00:40:01,707
you will still remember
your old high school buddy.

532
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,401
I mean, you'll still say hi
to me on campus and stuff.

533
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,778
Yeah, um, well, I'm not going to met U.

534
00:40:06,828 --> 00:40:07,971
What?

535
00:40:08,724 --> 00:40:12,573
What happened? Did another school sweep down
and give you the keys to the kingdom?

536
00:40:12,624 --> 00:40:16,512
I'm not playing football anymore.
I turned down my scholarship.

537
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:22,751
Let me get this straight. You were offered a full ride
with chrome wheels to play the game that you love,

538
00:40:22,818 --> 00:40:26,165
and you said, "thanks, but no thanks?"

539
00:40:27,554 --> 00:40:30,756
I don't know, I'm just not sure
that football's my calling.

540
00:40:36,362 --> 00:40:38,136
I'm proud of you, clark.

541
00:40:39,165 --> 00:40:40,905
You're proud of me?

542
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,763
Why?

543
00:40:44,621 --> 00:40:50,716
I just have a feeling that you're destined to do
a lot more in this world than just score touchdowns.

544
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:54,214
Chloe, you've been saying a lot
of weird things to me lately.

545
00:40:54,683 --> 00:40:57,394
What makes you think
I'm destined to do anything?

546
00:40:59,285 --> 00:41:00,902
Just a hunch.

547
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
