1
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,108
Get out of my way.

2
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,989
All right, rich boy, there you go.

3
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,723
Come on.

4
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,138
Next.

5
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,698
Well, look who it is.

6
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,839
-Hiya, freak!
-Van, back off!

7
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,002
You're the one
that should be in here!

8
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,708
You're the one
that should be in here!

9
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,542
They should lock you up, you freak!

10
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:00,208
Hey, Kent. It's me, Eric.

11
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,320
Been struck by lightning lately?

12
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,425
Good to see you, Clark.

13
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,157
Tell my two favorite ex-girlfriends
I said hello.

14
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,324
Keep moving, lan.

15
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,799
Jeez, kid. You seem to know
a lot of people in here.

16
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,702
Where's Lex?

17
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,312
You got 1 0 minutes.

18
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,021
Lex?

19
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,562
Clark, I was wondering
if I'd ever see you again.

20
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:50,499
I've been trying to visit you. The doctors
said you weren't ready to see anyone.

21
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,940
-Are you okay?
-I know your secret.

22
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,116
Don't worry.
I haven't said a word to anyone.

23
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,447
I need you to get me out of here.

24
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,852
I've seen what you can do.

25
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,721
That car hit you
at 60 miles an hour...

26
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,794
...and you tossed it like a toy.

27
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,659
Breaking me out's not gonna be
too much of a challenge.

28
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,528
-Lex, I want to--
-Then do it, Clark.

29
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,262
My father's never gonna let me out.

30
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,672
You're my friend.

31
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,034
Please, Clark.

32
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,772
Don't let me rot in this cesspool.

33
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,883
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,023
-Hey!
-Come on!

35
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,289
Get that bastard out of my sight!

36
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,228
I'll never forgive you
for this, Clark! Never!

37
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,273
Never!

38
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,903
Save me.

39
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,944
Save me.

40
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,180
Get up, Curly.

41
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,449
Time for your 9:00 meds.

42
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,126
Get up.

43
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,642
Oh, God!

44
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,306
Hey, Luthor!

45
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,342
What are you doing here, my friend?

46
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,677
I'm gonna take you back
to your room, okay?

47
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,375
Just relax.

48
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:30,138
I've never seen Lex so angry with me.
It's like he just went....

49
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,079
Crazy?

50
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,844
Well, you can't take it
personally, Clark.

51
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,756
It was hard not to.
He asked me to break him out.

52
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,223
You said no, didn't you?

53
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,056
Yeah.

54
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,159
-Well, that's good.
-Yeah, it's great.

55
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,790
He just broke himself out,
injured two guards along the way.

56
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,096
He doesn't belong in there.
He's being drugged.

57
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:56,264
Well, we don't know that for sure.
This isn't his first brush with mental illness.

58
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,177
Well, Lionel's never gonna let him out.
I'm his only chance.

59
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,442
You can't just break somebody
out of a state institution.

60
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:07,279
Then you'd go to jail, and Lex would be
out there, a fugitive with your secret.

61
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:10,684
-Pete knows, and that's turned out okay.
-Lex is different.

62
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,889
Look, I'm not saying you should put
your secret above Lex's well-being.

63
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,552
I just think that you should stay out
of this one.

64
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,924
-Dad--
-Clark.

65
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,362
You don't know everything
that's going on here.

66
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,893
Now, if you get involved--

67
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,231
It could just get worse.

68
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:50,626
You know, you've got another friend
in a hospital that you haven't visited.

69
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,388
Lana doesn't wanna see me
right now.

70
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,090
She was in shock, Clark.
She didn't mean what she said.

71
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,931
Except she's right.
All I've done is put her in danger.

72
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,403
She's better off without me.

73
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,532
What about you?
Are you better off?

74
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,339
You know, you can save
the whole world, Clark...

75
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,449
...but you gotta take care
of your own heart too.

76
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,809
Go see her.

77
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:27,162
Good, Lana. One more step.

78
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:34,328
Okay.
Okay, that's enough for today.

79
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,305
It goes for you too, Adam.

80
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,609
I know my limits.

81
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,111
If you overdo it,
you'll undo all your hard work.

82
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,942
If I listened to people like you,
I'd still be in bed.

83
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:50,145
-Good work today, sweetie.
-Thanks.

84
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,323
Hurts, doesn't it?

85
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,119
Like you wouldn't believe.

86
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,931
I think you're getting off
way too easily.

87
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,002
-Excuse me?
-You have to learn to push through the pain.

88
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:10,404
If we all sat down every time it hurt,
this country never would've been built.

89
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:14,512
Well, I doubt the Founding Fathers
broke their legs in four places.

90
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,873
What happened, bad pileup
in cheerleading practice?

91
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,510
No, no, seriously.

92
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,913
How'd you end up in here?

93
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,955
A horse got spooked.
I ended up under its hooves.

94
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,923
I'm guessing that's not
a good place to be.

95
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,961
I'm Adam.

96
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,260
Lana.

97
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,239
All right, Lana.

98
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:46,337
We both know that you have
one more lap in you in this puppy.

99
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,337
-Let's see it.
-How about not?

100
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:53,051
I know "struggle" is probably
not in your vocabulary...

101
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,483
...but just to let you know,
here, it's credo.

102
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,021
For your information,
I haven't walked in a month.

103
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,024
Feeling sorry for yourself may work now,
but it won't get you up a flight of stairs.

104
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,822
-Are you always this obnoxious?
-I'm telling you how it is.

105
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,124
No one's ever honest
with girls like you.

106
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,431
I bet you have a boyfriend
that's always protecting you, right?

107
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:12,795
But he's not here.

108
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:17,671
No one's gonna fight this battle for you.
You're on your own. See you around.

109
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,891
Hello, Lex.

110
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,533
You were making such good progress, son.

111
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,772
You're the one who taught me:

112
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,910
Attack adversity head-on.

113
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,246
And had you been taking your medication,
you would've done just that.

114
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:07,626
This institution is not your adversary, Lex.

115
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,590
Your illness is the enemy.

116
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,261
But I'm better now.

117
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,299
I don't need the meds.

118
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,694
That story about
you killing your parents...

119
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,306
...was nothing more than
a paranoid delusion.

120
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:27,878
See, somewhere along the line,
I veered off into the abyss...

121
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,972
...but I've managed
to claw my way back.

122
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,452
But that's irrelevant now.

123
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,891
What do you mean?

124
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:45,489
When your attempt to escape failed...

125
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:49,225
...you sabotaged my efforts
to have you released...

126
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,163
...to be cared for at home.

127
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:55,265
But I told you, I'm cured.

128
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:59,000
A cured patient doesn't belong
in a hospital.

129
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,116
Oh, it's painful to see you like this.

130
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,927
You know I have your best interest
at heart, don't you?

131
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,991
The only interest you have...

132
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,533
...is staying out of prison.

133
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,771
I'm not insane, and you know it.

134
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,845
It's sad to see a man
who's lost his mind.

135
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,272
But it's tragic when he's convinced
himself that he's sane.

136
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,378
You son of a bitch.

137
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,824
You did this to me.
You're the one who's insane!

138
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,628
You did this to me!

139
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:09,370
Well, if it isn't Ku Klux Van.

140
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,711
-Get out of my grill, freaks.
-I'd watch your mouth if I were you.

141
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:16,218
Yeah, we heard about your little
one-man ethnic-cleansing campaign.

142
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,848
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Come on.

143
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,788
You were picking off meteor freaks...

144
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,759
...Iike ducks on the first day
of hunting season.

145
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,057
And now you're stuck in here
with all us ducks.

146
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,190
Quack, quack.

147
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,068
We don't wanna hurt you, Van.

148
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:36,038
-The three of us have something in common.
-I seriously doubt that.

149
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,698
Clark Kent put us all in here.

150
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,173
And word on the ward
is you know his weakness.

151
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,577
-Why should I tell you?
-Well, because.

152
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,615
We're looking to sample
the sweet taste of revenge.

153
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:50,016
If you weaken him, I can leech his powers
and break us out of here.

154
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,454
Wait, you took Clark's powers?

155
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,957
-How?
-It's a lightning strike.

156
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,994
He took them back
with a high-voltage shock.

157
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,128
How do I know I can trust you freaks?

158
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,532
The enemy of your enemy
is your friend.

159
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,314
I don't feel comfortable moving forward
with the procedure.

160
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,786
Comfortable? Your comfort level
is of no concern to me, doctor.

161
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:28,620
I've indulged you for a month
while you've conducted this drug therapy...

162
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:31,695
...and not only does Lex's memory
remain completely intact...

163
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,389
...but he attempted to escape.

164
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,329
I can't afford to waste any more time.

165
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,869
Mr. Luthor, the procedure
you're proposing is Draconian.

166
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,473
It's successful in less than 50 percent
of patients.

167
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:47,010
It leaves the other half with irreparable brain
damage. Are you willing to take that risk?

168
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,273
No risk, no reward.
Isn't that what they say, doctor?

169
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,146
Performing this procedure on a patient
who doesn't require it is unconscionable.

170
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,518
But it's not the first time.
You've experimented with it before.

171
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,585
We had a mutual agreement,
didn't we?

172
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,887
I strongly suggest you keep
your part of the bargain.

173
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:07,260
So start the procedure immediately.

174
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,574
Clark, turn a light on.
It's bad for your eyes.

175
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,334
Why are you working so late?

176
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,876
Trying to prove Lex doesn't belong
in Belle Reve.

177
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,981
-And what'd you find on Lex?
-Well, I have his medical records.

178
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,447
Dr. Foster's definitely drugging him.

179
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,487
There are millions of reasons
why she could be administering this drug.

180
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:35,358
Psychotherapy is just trial and error.
This doesn't prove anything.

181
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,321
I know.
But I gotta do something.

182
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,835
Well, why don't we work on this
in the morning. This is just a pit stop.

183
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,836
I have to pick up Lana on my way home.

184
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,107
How is Lana?

185
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,042
It's been really tough.

186
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,711
She could use some moral support.

187
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,810
I sent her a card.

188
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,679
Nothing says, "l love you,"
more than a $1.50 piece of cardboard.

189
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,350
If she wanted me there, Chloe,
I'd be there.

190
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,463
Right now, I'm just trying
to keep my promises for once.

191
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,499
Keep me posted on the 'Free Lex" front.

192
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,105
Chloe, wait.

193
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,769
Dr. Foster has recommended Lex
for radical electroshock therapy.

194
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,906
That's a little extreme,
don't you think?

195
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,572
It is.

196
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,308
Memory loss is almost a given...

197
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:37,546
...and if things don't go exactly as planned,
Lex could turn out a vegetable.

198
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,714
When does this happen?

199
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,085
Twenty-four hours.

200
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,064
Is that my package?

201
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,204
I still don't get what you want
with one of these rocks.

202
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,710
How about we just
forget the whole thing?

203
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,249
Whatever floats your boat, my man.

204
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,962
So did you get
what you were waiting for?

205
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,066
It's in the box.

206
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:28,804
When Kent comes back...

207
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,943
...he's gonna have a little surprise
waiting for him.

208
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,337
You need a spot?

209
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,143
Look, when Clark shows up,
I'll be ready.

210
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,437
But until then,
don't pretend we're friends.

211
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,173
I just wanted you
to meet my better half.

212
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,450
Well, you should know better
than to trust a meteor freak.

213
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,427
What's the emergency?

214
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:32,200
Everything's fine here.

215
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,171
Is this what you're planning
on doing to Lex?

216
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,842
There's nothing wrong with Lex. You
drugged him. That's why he's delusional.

217
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:45,006
If you're here to accuse me of malpractice,
I hope you have the facts to back it up.

218
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,119
I'm sure you could explain
Lex's dubious drug regime...

219
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:52,087
...but what about the existing lawsuit
for radical electroshock therapy?

220
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:55,021
What happened to Mr. Watkins
was unfortunate.

221
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,924
But for your information,
that suit was dropped.

222
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:01,122
-Because Lionel Luthor paid it off.
-I'm very busy.

223
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,564
So if you two will excuse me.

224
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:09,472
Do you think if you turn Lex into a vegetable,
Lionel Luthor's gonna let you off the hook?

225
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:14,403
You have all the power here, doctor.
Please, help Lex and yourself.

226
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:27,114
Newspaper, magazine, crossword puzzle?

227
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,758
What do you think?

228
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,421
Right.

229
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,727
It must be a little bit difficult
to turn the pages.

230
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,866
What do you do
when you have an itch?

231
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,734
Get out of my face.

232
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:49,040
Boy, I bet you are just itching
to get out of this place.

233
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,110
Mr. Luthor, what would you do
if I told you...

234
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:59,121
...I'd figured out a way
for certain animals to escape the zoo?

235
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:04,652
-I'd ask you why you're still here.
-Funding issues.

236
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:09,028
Once I'm out, I need to disappear.
And a new identity doesn't come cheap.

237
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,500
Oh, I admired your ambition.

238
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,498
But when you tried to murder my friends
to get my money...

239
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,806
...you went a little too far.

240
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:22,208
I know I've made some mistakes
in the past...

241
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:27,945
-...but I'm all better now.
-And I'm happy for you.

242
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,951
The both of you.

243
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:34,855
Now, take your little cart, and go sucker
some other patient with a bank account.

244
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,192
Suit yourself.

245
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,458
Of course...

246
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,100
...if my brain were about to be deep-fried...

247
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,463
...I might have a little bit
different attitude.

248
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:50,097
It's gonna be hard to get around
when your toes are permanently curled.

249
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,873
Fear's an effective sales tactic,
but it doesn't work on me.

250
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,514
How about facts?

251
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,817
See...

252
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,215
...you're on deck, Mr. Luthor.

253
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,192
Where'd you get this?

254
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,355
I know everything that goes on
in this dump.

255
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,074
If you wanna save your cerebrum,
you know where to find me.

256
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,501
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm just pushing through the pain.

257
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:59,971
-I see you changed your therapy time.
-Yeah, I wasn't crazy about the company.

258
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:04,844
Would you believe me if I told you
I was a nice guy once with no issues?

259
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,042
Nice guys normally have the most issues.

260
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,923
That's why I came.
I wanted to apologize.

261
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,558
Sorry for taking it out on you.

262
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,591
I was upset
because you're kind of right.

263
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:25,002
I haven't really been pushing myself.

264
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,900
I guess it's because I know
when I get back on my feet...

265
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,064
...my life's gonna be different.

266
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,040
I don't really know
if I'm ready to face it.

267
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,746
So you never got around to telling me
why you're in here.

268
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:41,783
Isn't it obvious?
Fine cuisine, post-modern decor.

269
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,246
No, really, what happened?

270
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:52,362
Well, I tried to get into a burning building,
and a beam collapsed on me.

271
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,158
My parents were inside.
I thought I could save them.

272
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,169
God, I'm so sorry.

273
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,668
It happened.
Now I have to move on.

274
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,544
See?

275
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:16,185
I guess I'm a little afraid
of my future too.

276
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,925
I convinced Foster
to stop the procedure.

277
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,689
She's on her way now
to sign the cancellation papers.

278
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,356
And you think this is a good thing?

279
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,067
Clark, he knows your secret.

280
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:34,569
I can't let him turn Lex
into a vegetable just for that.

281
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:42,141
-You can't trust him.
-And you've never given him a chance.

282
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:43,575
And you give him too many.

283
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:49,851
You think it's easy keeping a lid on your
secret? I've gotta think about it all the time.

284
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:54,856
I gotta say "meteor rock," not "Kryptonite,"
and I gotta cover your unexplained exits.

285
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,822
-Pete, I'm sorry. You've never said anything.
-Clark, that's not the point.

286
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,626
The point is that I got your back...

287
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,995
...but Lex won't.

288
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,738
Chloe, what's wrong?

289
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,273
Claire Foster's dead.

290
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,836
They found her car wrapped around
a tree off Highway 54.

291
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,748
I feel the invisible hand
of Lionel Luthor.

292
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,716
You two had better back off
before he sets his sights on you.

293
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:36,198
I know you were just trying to help Lex,
but you've made matters worse.

294
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:40,702
-There's gotta be another way to stop it.
-Dr. Foster tried and look what happened.

295
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:44,104
Lionel Luthor is gonna make sure
this procedure happens.

296
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,719
Lex.

297
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,791
Clark, I knew you'd come.

298
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:04,925
Let's get you out of here.

299
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,606
All this time...

300
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,401
...I was right about you.

301
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,644
What do you know? It worked.

302
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,455
If it weren't for you, Kent...

303
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,465
...I'd be at Harvard right now
with a coed on each arm.

304
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,038
What the hell are you doing to him?

305
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,607
Your buddy's
our first-class ticket out of here.

306
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:03,219
Is that how you plan to escape?
I'm not giving you a cent. Clark's my friend.

307
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:08,155
You ought to pick your friends better,
since he didn't tell you his little secret.

308
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,392
Come on, let's get out of here.

309
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,489
No.

310
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,361
Lex.

311
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:23,206
-Leave him alone!
-Or you'll do what, Mr. Luthor?

312
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,708
Considering they're coming to fry your ass
in about five minutes.

313
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,139
Leave him alone!

314
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:51,692
Well, here he is. Right on schedule.

315
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,104
-Eric.
-Time to give me those powers back.

316
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,241
It's not like you use them anyway.

317
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,336
This will never work.

318
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:06,212
Are you kidding?
There's enough voltage in here...

319
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,581
...to power a small,
Third-World country.

320
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:16,758
Save your strength, Clark.
I'm gonna need it.

321
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,335
Clark!

322
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,302
Clark! Clark!

323
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,668
They've got Clark!

324
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:38,338
-How the hell did he get out?
-I don't know, but I ain't taking any chances.

325
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,916
No! No!

326
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:55,289
-There you go. Almost.
-Okay.

327
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,229
Done.

328
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,668
It's not Mount Everest, but it is a start.

329
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,431
A few days ago,
I wouldn't have thought that possible.

330
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:08,807
Sometimes you just have to look
impossibility straight in the eye.

331
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:16,086
Mrs. Kent, what a surprise.

332
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,712
Chloe had a late deadline. She asked
if I could give you a ride home.

333
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,755
-I'm gonna go.
-Okay.

334
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,791
-Hello.
-Hello.

335
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,488
Interesting physical therapist.

336
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,866
So how's Clark?
I got his card.

337
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:43,169
-I'm sorry he hasn't come by to see you.
-To be honest, that was kind of my idea.

338
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:53,622
Lana, I know that Clark's not always
the easiest person to understand...

339
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,425
...but he never meant
to put you in danger.

340
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,190
Did he send you to argue his case?

341
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,296
He doesn't know I'm here.
I'm sure he'd be upset that I was meddling.

342
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,768
I just want him to be happy.

343
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,472
I know.

344
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,612
But you need to be happy too, Lana.

345
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,310
Thanks, Mrs. Kent.

346
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:35,866
Please. I'll pay you
whatever you want.

347
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:39,498
You'll never have to work
another day in your life.

348
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,435
He doesn't want your money, son.

349
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,643
He wants to make you better.

350
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,509
Just like I do.

351
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,617
-You're a liar.
-No. Be strong, Lex.

352
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,085
-Liar!
-I'm sorry, son.

353
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,952
-No, don't do this, Dad. Don't do--
-Be strong. Be strong.

354
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:07,189
Be strong. Be strong. I'm sorry, son.
I didn't think it would have to come to this.

355
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,664
If it were a gangrenous limb,
we could amputate.

356
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:18,104
The brain, unfortunately,
is infinitely more complex.

357
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,503
No, don't do this!

358
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,109
-Do it.
-No!

359
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:31,711
Hey! Come on, let's go!

360
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,021
I'm right here.

361
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,218
What happened to your better half?

362
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,056
It's a lot easier to break one person out
than two.

363
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,027
Let's go.

364
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,513
-What is it? What's happening?
-We don't have any power.

365
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:06,418
-There must be a short somewhere.
-Well, fix it.

366
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,241
Do you feel any different?

367
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,911
Does that answer your question?

368
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,866
Welcome back to being normal, Clark.
Kind of sucks, doesn't it?

369
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:03,046
All right, you'll pay for the two
wasted years I spent in here.

370
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:06,240
-Eric, let's go.
-I'm not through with him yet.

371
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,250
They're gonna realize we're gone.
They'll be here any minute.

372
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,287
-What do I care? It's not my problem.
-No, no, wait a second.

373
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:17,585
-We're a team. I thought we were friends.
-There's no such thing as friends in here.

374
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,756
Hey!

375
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,129
Is that all you got?

376
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,141
That little jolt make you insane, Clark?

377
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,908
Look who's afraid to use
their powers now.

378
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,509
I don't know what happened.

379
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,707
Again.

380
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,515
But, sir, the way this equipment is working,
we should wait.

381
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,191
Do it.

382
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,554
Again.

383
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,237
Tell me where Lex is.

384
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,379
Now.

385
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,875
Lex.

386
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,675
Son?

387
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,887
It's over.

388
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,402
-Hi.
-Hey.

389
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,798
Am I hallucinating? No crutches.

390
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:47,343
It's amazing what you can accomplish when
someone's cracking a whip over your head.

391
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,943
-You okay?
-Yeah.

392
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:58,020
This? Don't let it spook you.
I tend to get dehydrated from time to time.

393
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:04,121
Well, I know that these probably can't
compare to the desserts in here...

394
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:09,460
...but I wanted to thank you
for being such a pain in the butt.

395
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,801
Anytime.

396
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:16,799
So I guess this is goodbye.

397
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:21,434
Just because I finished physical therapy
doesn't mean I won't come by and visit.

398
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,873
Lana, please.

399
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:28,551
I'm a memory from a painful moment in your
life. Who wants to be reminded of that?

400
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,054
We all push through the pain, Adam.

401
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,418
Maybe you're not willing to do that.

402
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,888
Lana, I'll be completely honest with you.

403
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,159
I like you.

404
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:46,335
But I get the feeling that
there's someone else...

405
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:50,063
...and I don't wanna be caught
in the middle of anything.

406
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:54,205
There is nothing
to be caught in the middle of.

407
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,337
But...

408
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:01,607
...I'm not really ready to be jumping
into another relationship right away.

409
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,380
Trust me, I don't wanna be
your rebound boy either...

410
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,020
...but I would like to be your friend.

411
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:10,794
Oh, I'd like that.

412
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,954
Good.

413
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,691
Then we're friends?

414
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,701
Friends.

415
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,844
Lex.

416
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:39,282
-Clark.
-How you feeling?

417
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,725
Great, actually.

418
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,087
Never better.

419
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:53,565
I heard you came to visit me,
and I wasn't a very cordial host.

420
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,640
If that's true, I'm sorry.

421
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,371
Did your dad tell you
why he had you committed?

422
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,610
He said I had a psychotic break.

423
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:12,754
They think my island trauma precipitated it.
I'm grateful my father recognized it in time.

424
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,152
Me too.

425
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,829
Do you wanna tell me something, Clark?

426
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,762
No.

427
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,469
It's good to have you back, Lex.

428
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,830
Welcome home.

429
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,934
You know, Clark,
there is one thing I'll never forget.

430
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,477
What's that?

431
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:52,285
How important your friendship is to me.

432
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:11,637
I'm sorry, Clark.

433
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,810
Lex is okay.

434
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,311
Your secret's safe.

435
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:20,715
You gotta find some consolation in that.

436
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,222
Lex is right.

437
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,760
Lionel got away with murder.

438
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:29,127
But you didn't tell him
what really happened.

439
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,600
Well, I figured, what's the point?

440
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,501
Clark.

441
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:43,075
Clark, I do not want you and Chloe
taking up this charge.

442
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,682
Someone's gonna make Lionel
pay for his crime.

443
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,753
Someday somebody will make
Lionel pay for his crime...

444
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,650
...but that day is not today, Clark.

445
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,819
I know this is very difficult...

446
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:01,931
...but you have to realize there are people
who are more powerful than you are.

447
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,135
Yeah.

448
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,756
You okay?

449
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,785
In a way, I envy Lex.

450
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,597
He seemed so happy.

451
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,971
I wish I could erase
the last few months of my life.

452
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,208
I heard they're having a welcome-back party
for Lana at the Talon.

453
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,911
Why don't you go.

454
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,120
You never quit, do you?

455
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,392
It's called tough love.

456
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:07,130
Come on. Go.

457
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,526
I know your secret.

458
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,033
I know your secret.

459
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,735
I haven 't said a word to anyone.

460
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,105
I know your secret.

461
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,744
I haven 't said a word to anyone.

462
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:33,022
Why didn't you show me this sooner?

463
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,216
-lt took all week to enhance the audio, sir.
-A week?

464
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:39,055
And this is the best you can do?

465
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,894
I know your secret.

466
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,262
I know your secret.

467
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,631
I know your secret.

468
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
