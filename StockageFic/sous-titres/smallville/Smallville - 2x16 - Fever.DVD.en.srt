1
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,227
Hey, Mom, you down here?

2
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:41,729
Clark, I thought you went to the hardware
store with your father.

3
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:45,571
We were on our way, then Dad remembered
he had the part he needed in the barn.

4
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,704
What are you doing down here?

5
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:52,079
I came down to get some peaches
for dessert. I'll be right up.

6
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:53,480
Okay.

7
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:08,626
Well, that ought to do it.

8
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,333
That was fast.

9
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,901
I offered Dad a bit of spot welding,
but he said it'd slow him down.

10
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,008
As hard as it is to believe,
your abilities are no substitute...

11
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,235
...for a 3/4-inch copper washer.

12
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,547
Well, it sounds like the two of you deserve
a nice, cold glass of lemonade.

13
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,042
Mom, you all right?

14
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:51,965
Martha!

15
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:56,441
Dad, she's not breathing. Mom? Mom!

16
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,006
Martha?

17
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,811
The good news is we've managed
to stabilize her.

18
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,210
She's breathing on her own.

19
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,874
I don't understand.
She worked outside all morning.

20
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:17,386
She seemed fine. How could something
come over her so quickly?

21
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,081
My guess is we're dealing
with some sort of toxin.

22
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,093
I'll have a better idea after we finish
her blood work.

23
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,697
All right. I'm gonna stay right here.

24
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,629
I'll have an orderly bring you some coffee.

25
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,433
Thank you.

26
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,263
She's gonna be okay.

27
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,132
I know that, son.

28
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,038
I also know that she wouldn't want us both
out here standing guard.

29
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,442
I'm not leaving.

30
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,210
Your mother had a list of things
she needed to get done for the fundraiser.

31
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,820
You know how important
the food bank is to her.

32
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,388
All right.

33
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,519
As soon as I'm finished, I'm coming back
to camp out with you.

34
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,273
I thought that your mom was bringing over
the prizes for the raffle.

35
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,973
She was, but she came down
with something this morning.

36
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,812
My dad's at the hospital with her.

37
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,084
Hospital? It sounds serious.

38
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,686
Any idea what's wrong?

39
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,984
- They're waiting on some test results.
- They have to know something.

40
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,186
- What were her symptoms?
- What is this, an interview?

41
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,695
She stopped breathing, okay?

42
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,300
This whole event was your mom's idea.

43
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,236
Maybe we should just postpone
until she's back on her feet.

44
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:46,310
No, I appreciate the thought, Lana,
but she's gonna be okay...

45
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,004
...and she'd be really disappointed
if we cancelled.

46
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,616
- Clark, I didn't mean to just...
- It's okay, Chloe.

47
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,717
I'm gonna get back to the hospital.

48
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,910
Mr. Kent?

49
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:27,147
I know we've already gone over this,
but I'm gonna ask you one more time.

50
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,845
Has Martha been exposed to any
unusual substances over the last few days?

51
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,856
Nothing she hasn't been around before.
What is this about?

52
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,587
I've been going over Martha's
blood cultures...

53
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,096
...and her symptoms indicate
an acute toxic reaction...

54
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:45,460
...but I can't identify the source.
- But you can do something for her, right?

55
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,572
I've sent her blood samples
to Metropolis for further testing.

56
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,740
But I have to be honest with you,
I'm concerned...

57
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,247
...for both Martha and the health
of her baby.

58
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,553
Baby?

59
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:05,785
You didn't know?

60
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:10,017
There must be some kind of mistake.

61
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,790
The doctors said that she
could never have a baby.

62
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,193
I asked your G.P. To fax over Martha's
medical records.

63
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:17,999
There's no mistake.

64
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,877
I saw Mr. Kent in the hall.

65
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,520
He looked worried. Is everything all right?

66
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,785
We're doing everything we can.

67
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:48,162
Johns Hopkins. Good school.

68
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,132
Go ahead. Read it.

69
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,147
They're offering you
a three-year research fellowship.

70
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,546
I'm impressed.

71
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:11,747
It's an opportunity to do pure research
at one of the best hospitals in the country.

72
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:15,087
As opposed to the rural pleasures
of Smallville Medical.

73
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:20,292
Lex, I like my work here,
but research has always been my first love.

74
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,831
So...

75
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:26,799
...what do you think?

76
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,070
Trust me...

77
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,911
...there's nothing worse
than a missed opportunity.

78
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,551
Dr. Bryce?

79
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,352
I'm Dr. Neil Moore.
We're here about Martha Kent.

80
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,490
I'll let you get back to work.

81
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,369
A baby?

82
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,066
She didn't tell me anything about it.

83
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,441
- Why would she keep it a secret?
- I don't know.

84
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,414
Mr. Kent.

85
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,247
This is Dr. Moore
with the Disease Control Agency.

86
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,647
Mr. Kent.

87
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,119
Disease? I'm sorry, but what does
that have to do with my wife?

88
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:22,293
The Disease Control Agency gets called in
whenever it's a matter of public safety.

89
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,129
The Metropolis lab sent them
Martha's blood work.

90
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,697
I don't mean to alarm you...

91
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,131
...but your wife's condition is caused
by some unknown toxin.

92
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,564
We're here to find it and identify it.

93
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,569
Can someone else come down with this?

94
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,470
Frankly, son, we can't know that
until we find the source.

95
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:41,340
We need to backtrack Mrs. Kent's
movements over the last couple of days.

96
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,606
She hasn't left the farm
since the weekend.

97
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,751
She's been on the phone
doing fundraising.

98
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,579
Then that's where we need to start.

99
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,382
Start what?

100
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:52,149
Searching your property
for the source of the poison:

101
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,917
The house, the out buildings...

102
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,721
...anything Mrs. Kent might have
come in contact with.

103
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,023
Clark, the ship.

104
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,550
Pete, you're sure the ship will be safe
in your shed?

105
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:28,023
Yeah. I'll put it between the old Betamax
and my dad's Pong game.

106
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,125
Indiana Jones couldn't find it down there.

107
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,100
Clark!

108
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,203
Clark, what are you...?

109
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,208
Pete, you okay?

110
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,311
I'm fine.

111
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,251
What happened to you?

112
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,086
I'm not sure.

113
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,324
Let's get out of here.

114
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,431
Come on, let's get this thing back
on the road.

115
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,101
Come on, stop fooling around.
I've seen you bench-press a trailer.

116
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,302
- Let's go.
- I'm trying.

117
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,011
I can't do this, Pete.

118
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,443
Clark, X-Files alert.

119
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,889
That's the DCA team.

120
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,458
We've gotta get this thing back
on the road.

121
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,864
We got it.

122
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,981
- Find anything yet?
- No, not yet.

123
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,552
- You got the ship out of there?
- Yeah, it's at Pete's. It's safe.

124
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,825
Dad, when I was driving...

125
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,761
...my vision suddenly blurred
and I lost control of the truck.

126
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,597
- You and Pete are all right, aren't you?
- Yeah.

127
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,632
For a moment, I lost all my strength.

128
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,363
- Dr. Moore.
- Go ahead.

129
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,764
I'm getting a hit in the storm cellar.

130
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:32,435
I'm registering a positive
for organic particulate matter.

131
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:36,878
Looks like someone was digging around
and kicked up some sort of irradiated spore.

132
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:39,341
Get a surface sample.

133
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,952
Ten centimeters and 50 centimeters.

134
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:02,170
Mr. Kent, we found this in a tin
buried inside your storm cellar.

135
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,338
Have you ever seen it before?

136
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,372
No.

137
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:10,477
Has Mrs. Kent been down
in that cellar recently?

138
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,979
Not that I know of.
We usually keep it locked.

139
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,484
Actually, Dad,
she was down there this morning.

140
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,318
This is Moore.

141
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:23,587
I want a cleanup team to sterilize
every inch of that storm cellar.

142
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,256
I don't get it. We've been searching
for that key for months.

143
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,264
How did it end up in the storm cellar?

144
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,268
When I fixed the leak under the sink,
I noticed the flour jar.

145
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,099
Your mother must have moved it.

146
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,436
- Why didn't she tell us she had it?
- She must have her reasons, Clark.

147
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,805
Right now, I'm more concerned
about her health.

148
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,539
Me too. What do you think
those spores are?

149
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:46,748
I don't know, but whatever they are,
you were exposed to them too.

150
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,784
Maybe that's why you lost your strength.

151
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:51,115
No, Dad, I just had a glitch.
I'm fine.

152
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,188
You don't have to worry about me.

153
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,922
We need to think about Mom.

154
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,873
Sweetheart.

155
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,978
How you feeling?

156
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,042
I should have told you about the baby.

157
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,282
I'm so sorry.

158
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,455
Why didn't you tell me?

159
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:31,222
I was worried if I said it out loud,
it would go away.

160
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:40,833
Martha.

161
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,071
How is it even possible?

162
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,678
The day of the tornado...

163
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,007
...when Nixon opened Clark's ship...

164
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,850
...something strange happened.

165
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,747
And there was a blinding light...

166
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:03,123
...and I felt a surge of energy
go through my body.

167
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,526
You're saying you think the ship
has the power to heal?

168
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:11,168
I think the ship made it possible
for me to get pregnant.

169
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,836
However it happened, Martha,
it's a miracle.

170
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,684
They found the key.

171
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,650
In the storm cellar?

172
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:36,225
- Why did you hide it from us?
- I know it was wrong...

173
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:42,093
...but I was afraid if Clark
opened the ship...

174
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,568
...and found out the truth
about his origins he'd...

175
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,668
He would want to leave us.

176
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:53,536
Martha, that's not going to happen.

177
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,454
- Clark.
- Hi, Lana.

178
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,259
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

179
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,270
It's weird how random memories
can just pop into your head, huh?

180
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:30,243
When I was in second grade,
I was afraid to go to school...

181
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,180
...because I thought Mom would disappear
while I was gone...

182
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,944
...and never come back.

183
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,583
I wouldn't even get on the bus...

184
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,157
...until she promised she'd be there
when I got home.

185
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,123
Sure enough...

186
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,126
...every day, there she was when
I walked through the door.

187
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,032
Don't worry, Clark.

188
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:54,036
In a few days, you'll walk through the door
and your mom will be there again.

189
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,672
Clark, you okay?

190
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,445
Clark. Clark!

191
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,317
Clark.

192
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,725
What happened?

193
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,795
Lana, would you excuse us, please?

194
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:43,450
Clark was exposed to the same toxin
his mother was.

195
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:48,318
You should've called an ambulance. He needs
a hospital. We need to inform the DCA.

196
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,395
- I'm sorry, I can't let you do that.
- Why the hell not?

197
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,461
I need you to promise me
that you won't tell anybody...

198
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,159
...about this, and I mean anybody.

199
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:02,000
Mr. Kent, I take my doctor-patient
confidentiality very seriously...

200
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,698
...but Clark needs proper care.

201
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,971
Doctor, Clark isn't exactly
what you'd call a normal boy.

202
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,779
I need to get a blood sample.

203
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,220
Listen, Dr. Bryce, you can't do that.

204
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:21,325
- Is this some sort of religious thing?
- No, I mean literally, you can't do that.

205
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,076
You can't take that sample to a lab.

206
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,183
I'm trying to help your son...

207
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,757
...but I can't unless you tell me
what's going on.

208
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:59,154
You need to promise me that you will do
the lab work on this blood yourself.

209
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,232
If you do the blood work yourself,
I think you'll understand...

210
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,996
...why you can't tell anyone about Clark.

211
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:27,753
Oh, my God.

212
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,123
Lex.

213
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,597
Came by to see how Mrs. Kent was doing.

214
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,266
I saw the DCA, must be serious.

215
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,599
You know I'm not allowed
to discuss my patients.

216
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,573
The Kents are like family to me,
more than my own.

217
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,843
I know, and I would tell you everything
if I could.

218
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,749
I understand. I just wish there
was something I could do to help.

219
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,909
Unfortunately, modern medicine doesn't
always have the answers.

220
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,720
I guess that's the attraction
of a research fellowship...

221
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,487
...the chance to help unlock
the mysteries of science.

222
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,963
I'd better get back to work.

223
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,337
Helen.

224
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,473
Johns Hopkins will be lucky to have you.

225
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,288
Hi, Mr. Kent.
Lana told me what happened.

226
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:16,025
- Is Clark okay?
- Yeah, he's just resting on the couch.

227
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,635
I'll be sure to tell him you stopped by
to say hello.

228
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:22,399
I'm sorry, I must be more annoying
than a door-to-door salesman.

229
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,668
I was wondering if I could just sit
with him for a while?

230
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,880
Yes.

231
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:32,175
Chloe, I'm sorry. Sure, go on in.

232
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,578
- I'll wait upstairs.
- Okay, thanks.

233
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,437
Hi, Clark.

234
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,071
Well, this is gonna make quite a story.

235
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:07,307
"Clark Kent Ends Record-Breaking
Perfect Attendance Streak."

236
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,382
Sorry.

237
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,722
I'm doing it again.

238
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,520
I just...

239
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:21,330
I've never seen you sick before,
and it just got me thinking.

240
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,234
What if something did happen to you...

241
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,670
...and I never got to...?

242
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,768
So in yet another classic maneuver
to avoid emotional intimacy...

243
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:40,276
...I wrote my feelings down
so that I could read them to you...

244
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,182
...thereby avoiding embarrassing
eye contact.

245
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,891
I want to let you in on a secret.

246
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,831
I'm not who you think I am.

247
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,833
In fact, my disguise is so thin...

248
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,700
...I'm surprised you haven't seen
right through me.

249
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:07,602
I'm the girl of your dreams masquerading
as your best friend.

250
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,312
Sometimes I wanna rip off this facade
like I did at the Spring Formal...

251
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:18,182
...but I can't, because you'll get scared
and you'll run away again.

252
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:24,918
So I decided that it's better to live
with the lie than expose my true feelings.

253
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:28,491
This is so much easier
when you're unconscious.

254
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,931
My dad told me
there are two types of girls...

255
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,808
...the ones you grow out of
and the ones you grow into.

256
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,574
I really hope I'm the latter.

257
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,484
I may not be the one you love today...

258
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:53,820
...but I'll let you go for now,
hoping one day you'll fly back to me.

259
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,188
Because I think you're worth the wait.

260
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:07,769
Clark?

261
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,107
Lana?

262
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:44,870
Dad.

263
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,143
Clark, you shouldn't be up.

264
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,969
Where are you going?

265
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,748
- I'm going to Pete's to get the ship.
- Now?

266
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,544
How is Mom?

267
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,186
Dad?

268
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:09,158
Clark, Helen says that your mother probably
won't make it through the night.

269
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,532
And now you too.

270
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:20,544
You can't think about me.
We gotta help Mom.

271
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,374
I'm not gonna lose my family,
not without a fight.

272
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,807
Now, if it takes a miracle,
I'll have to go out and find one.

273
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:30,148
The ship.
You think it can cure me and Mom?

274
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,356
I don't know, Clark.

275
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,424
I'm grasping at straws.
The doctors can't help you...

276
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,188
...and your mother thinks the ship
helped her get pregnant.

277
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,331
I don't know, maybe it's crazy.

278
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,796
The only way to get it to work
is with that key.

279
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,396
I know that, son.

280
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,828
I also know where the DCA
took everything.

281
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,972
- I'm going there now.
- I'll go with you.

282
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:52,109
No. I want you to stay right here,
you're too sick.

283
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,102
Go to bed, son.

284
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,786
Hold it right there. On the ground, now!

285
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,359
Hands at your sides!

286
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,191
Clark!

287
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:37,229
I thought you could use a hand.

288
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,411
We gotta run, son. Come on!

289
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,257
He's moving down to the gate!

290
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,871
Unlock the gates! Let's go!

291
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:16,092
Code blue, room 117. Code blue.

292
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:27,339
This is the DCA.
Stop your vehicle immediately.

293
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,270
Get out of the truck
and put your hands up!

294
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,615
Something wrong, officer?

295
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,378
This guy doesn't fit the description.

296
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,157
Clear.

297
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:35,840
Come on.

298
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,314
Time of death, 2:17 a.m.

299
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,980
- So is it a boy or a girl?
- Clark...

300
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:21,710
- Doctor, please, don't answer that.
- We wanna find out the old-fashioned way.

301
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:25,511
The important thing is that
the baby's healthy and so are you.

302
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:30,058
In medical terms,
it's nothing short of a miracle.

303
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,355
Your family seems to have
a stockpile of them.

304
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,827
I saw Clark's blood test...

305
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,669
...and I saw Mrs. Kent
make an impossible recovery.

306
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,134
If you know how that happened,
you should tell me.

307
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:50,336
Just like you said, doc...

308
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,544
...it's a miracle.

309
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:21,071
Dr. Trenton, I appreciate you keeping me
apprised of the situation.

310
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,908
I shouldn't be doing this.

311
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:29,979
If anyone finds out I'm giving you a file
on a patient, I could lose my job.

312
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:39,121
Mrs. Kent was a very sick woman.
What's your interest in her?

313
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:43,893
She's a good friend of mine.
That's all you need to know.

314
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,847
- Hey.
- Hi.

315
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:09,117
I ran into Clark in the hall.
He said Martha's gonna be fine.

316
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:10,692
Congratulations, doc.

317
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:13,796
Don't know how much I had to do with it.

318
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:15,932
Then how do you explain it?

319
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:21,402
Right, I almost forgot,
you can't discuss your patients.

320
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:23,997
I got you something.

321
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,638
A going-away present?

322
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,747
On the contrary.

323
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,008
Open it.

324
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,450
It's a key to the mansion.
I want you to move in.

325
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:46,724
Lex.

326
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,126
I'd never want to stand in the way
of your ambitions...

327
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:56,201
...but I'd be the one missing an opportunity
if I didn't tell you I want you to stay.

328
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:17,294
- "Attack of the killer mold spores"?
- Yeah.

329
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,430
I'll never look at blue cheese
the same way again.

330
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:25,433
I couldn't bring myself to go back
and visit Clark when he was sick.

331
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,295
Does that make me a horrible person?

332
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,937
No.

333
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,638
I guess it just really scared me
to see him like that.

334
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,045
Me too.

335
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:40,047
Kind of makes you realize
who's important in your life.

336
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:46,188
Yeah. And who's important to Clark.

337
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,893
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

338
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:54,689
I'm gonna head home
and finish changing for the benefit.

339
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,623
Are the programs ready?

340
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:00,236
They are, right behind the desk.
I'll see you there.

341
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:01,666
Thanks.

342
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,618
I want to let you in on a secret, Clark.

343
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,389
I'm not who you think I am.

344
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,120
In fact, my disguise is so thin...

345
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,857
...I'm surprised you haven't seen
right through me.

346
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,427
I'm the girl of your dreams masquerading
as your best friend.

347
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,849
Pete, this is awesome.

348
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:32,359
Clark. It's good to see you
among the living, man.

349
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,188
Check it out.

350
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,134
It's the latest Talon mix.

351
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,702
Thanks, Pete.

352
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:45,368
- And thanks for helping with the police.
- No problem.

353
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:50,071
Although, if I had a choice,
I'd rather play DJ than decoy any day.

354
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,579
So...

355
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,651
...is the investigation over?
- Yeah. I hope so.

356
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:08,128
- I'll catch up with you later.
- Good seeing you, man.

357
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,728
Hey, Chloe.

358
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,032
My dad said you came to visit
when I was sick.

359
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,429
It was really sweet of you. Thanks.

360
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:19,504
Sure. What are friends for?

361
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,841
I'm just gonna go buy a raffle ticket
before the drawing.

362
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:30,418
I mean, what could be more poetically just,
me winning a computer?

363
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,474
Clark.

364
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:00,113
Hey, Lana. This is a great party.

365
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,582
Your mom deserves a lot of the credit.

366
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:04,919
Is Chloe okay?

367
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:08,391
What happened to you really affected her.

368
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:13,721
Me too.

369
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,191
It was really hard seeing you sick.

370
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:21,633
Guess I somehow always thought of you
as invincible.

371
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,831
Now you think I'm just human.

372
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,411
I guess that's my way of saying
that you mean a lot to me, Clark.

373
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:32,380
And I know it's not that eloquent...

374
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:40,579
...but I guess some people are just better
with words than others.

375
