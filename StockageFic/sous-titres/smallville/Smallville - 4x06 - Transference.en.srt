1
00:00:02,952 --> 00:00:06,400
31, 42... hut!

2
00:00:16,403 --> 00:00:18,929
And the Crows take the state championship! ha ha

3
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:23,918
Well, I knew you were talented
I didn't know you could see the future

4
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,402
- I was just practicing
- Oh, it's good to visualize game-winning plays,

5
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:31,286
especially when the coach of Metropolis University
is coming to the game on Friday night,

6
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:34,335
to check out the new star quarterback.

7
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,681
- Are you kidding me?
- I don't kid about football

8
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,443
That's great, I...

9
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:42,251
Are you OK?

10
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:47,086
Coach, I'll take care of him. Thanks for
stopping by, that's great news

11
00:00:48,724 --> 00:00:52,551
Clark... Clark, what's the matter son?

12
00:00:52,808 --> 00:00:54,407
- I hear ringing.
- Can you tell me where it's coming from?

13
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:58,042
I need to go.

14
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,949
Clark!

15
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:18,458
You don't look well dad.
Forget to take your vitamins?

16
00:01:19,406 --> 00:01:21,900
I know how deeply angry you are Lex

17
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,643
you let them put me in this God-forsaken
place because of that anger

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,607
but it's too late to change anything now

19
00:01:28,944 --> 00:01:33,560
So I've heard. A month left before
your liver gives up on you for good

20
00:01:34,777 --> 00:01:38,471
What, you didn't think I would trek all the way
out here without having a chat with your doctor?

21
00:01:39,698 --> 00:01:43,666
I wanted to see you, Lex to say goodbye...
face-to-face.

22
00:01:46,761 --> 00:01:50,634
I have done many things in my life
that I have come to regret

23
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:54,522
but there is one thing
I'll never forgive myself

24
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:03,310
I never... said...

25
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,394
I love you.

26
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:22,406
Please.

27
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:38,503
Lex don't!

28
00:03:02,873 --> 00:03:04,070
Clark?

29
00:03:12,174 --> 00:03:12,793
Right there.

30
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:17,361
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

31
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:20,382
Let me go!

32
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:24,682
Let go of me! Lex! Lex!
Let go of me!

33
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:28,908
What the hell are you doing here?

34
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,442
Your father he... wanted to see me.

35
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,299
Did he ask you to tackle me
to the floor while you're at it?

36
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,828
He had something sharp, Lex...

37
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:40,629
A knife.

38
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:42,994
Let him go.

39
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:51,505
Let's get out of here Lex.

40
00:03:52,706 --> 00:03:54,334
Now.

41
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Smallville - 4. sezona:
Epizoda 6: Prenos

42
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:04,429
Clark, you don't seem like your usual self.
You barely said a word the entire ride home.

43
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:10,891
Sorry.
Being in that prison...

44
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:12,986
I guess it upset me.

45
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,913
Yeah, well it isn't exactly
the happiest place on earth.

46
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:18,272
No, it isn't Lex.

47
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:22,414
Do you ever feel guilty?

48
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:26,022
About sending your father to prison, I mean.

49
00:05:26,818 --> 00:05:29,257
Why would I?
The man murdered his parents.

50
00:05:31,427 --> 00:05:33,386
I did Society a favor.

51
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:39,375
And that blood relationship,
it doesn't mean anything to you?

52
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:45,004
Clark, since when did you become president
of my father's Fan club?

53
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:48,967
You're right... of course.

54
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,433
He's only your father

55
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:57,763
Why should you feel anything?

56
00:06:10,192 --> 00:06:11,304
Hey Clark.

57
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,610
Dad.
Yeah, come on over here son.

58
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,964
I'm glad you're back. Your mother and I
were really getting worried about you.

59
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:24,161
Are you feeling all right?
I feel fine.

60
00:06:25,204 --> 00:06:30,384
That's a relief. It's never a good sign when
people around here start hearing strange noises.

61
00:06:31,597 --> 00:06:33,612
Look, since you're here, give me a hand.
Lift it on up.

62
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:35,913
Lift?

63
00:06:36,652 --> 00:06:38,335
Lift what?

64
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,730
The tractor.

65
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:42,483
It's been giving me trouble all week, I need
to check out the rear end, come on.

66
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:43,856
Lift it up.

67
00:06:48,327 --> 00:06:49,320
How would I do that?

68
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:54,075
Very funny, Clark, but I don't have all day.
Lift up the tractor please, come on.

69
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:58,407
Let's go!

70
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:18,766
Really nice, but I'm not 5'4". Lift it up,
over your head, I need to get under the back.

71
00:07:31,393 --> 00:07:33,285
All right, that ought to do it.

72
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:38,467
Of course.

73
00:07:41,232 --> 00:07:42,786
It all makes sense now...

74
00:07:43,323 --> 00:07:44,544
What's that?

75
00:07:45,308 --> 00:07:49,654
Oh... it's just...

76
00:07:50,326 --> 00:07:51,663
boy, is it dirty under here.

77
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:55,073
Are you sure you're all right?

78
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:59,799
Never felt better in my life.

79
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:23,990
You must be Lex.

80
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,577
Lex? No, I'm not Lex.
I'm Clark Kent.

81
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:30,397
Houston, we have a problem

82
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,474
That Stone was meant for Lex.

83
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,163
Where did Lionel get this?

84
00:08:39,176 --> 00:08:44,034
- Um... I don't know
- Please, you have to tell me

85
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:57,010
It came from this Mayan rain god statue

86
00:08:57,888 --> 00:09:00,575
One of his teams found it in an underwater
ruin off the coast of Honduras.

87
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:02,962
How did he know to search there?

88
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:07,380
Well he's scouring the globe. these ancient
symbols? They've shown up in Egypt...

89
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:12,619
Central America, even a sacred Indian
cave right here in Kansas

90
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:17,772
These symbols, they look like they
mean something

91
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:23,799
You better believe it. The mark
on your stone right there, it means

92
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:27,451
water. That's the element of,
you know, transformation.

93
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,357
How do you know that?

94
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,480
Well, I've always had a thing for
pattern recognition, codes,

95
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,681
ciphers, that sort of thing. That one
means fire, and the other one up there

96
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:40,510
that's air. So you take the three,
put them together...

97
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,992
Mayan legend says it leads you to a trove
of knowledge beyond your wildest dreams

98
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:50,181
I didn't believe any of this myself until,
58 minutes, 14 seconds ago

99
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:53,870
when a myth about body jumping,
suddenly became... real.

100
00:09:57,624 --> 00:10:00,781
Hard to argue with it now,
stranger things have happened

101
00:10:00,862 --> 00:10:02,383
What did you do to end up in here?

102
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,367
If you ask the DA, I embezzled $14 million
from the Princeton University pension fund

103
00:10:07,944 --> 00:10:10,041
- Did you do it?
- I'm a mathematician, I'm looking for

104
00:10:10,515 --> 00:10:14,249
hidden patterns in the Sea Scrolls,
money doesn't really mean a lot to me.

105
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,874
You know what happened?
I was framed.

106
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:21,846
And you just happened to end up in this
prison, in Lionel Luthor's cell?

107
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:25,804
Yeah, that was pretty lucky, huh?
All I have to do is give him a hand

108
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:29,199
with a couple of these symbols, and he
set me up with his lawyers.

109
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,461
They're still trying to get me out of here,
I just hope he lasts long enough...

110
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:35,716
What do you mean?

111
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:39,142
He's dying.

112
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:42,380
Yeah, he's dying.

113
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,707
Mathematically speaking.

114
00:10:47,877 --> 00:10:52,276
If he's dying, then...
that means...

115
00:10:53,856 --> 00:10:55,027
I'm going to die.

116
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:58,720
Oui, Mademoiselle...

117
00:11:00,607 --> 00:11:02,837
How may I help you sir?

118
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,321
This...

119
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:10,103
This is Lionel Luthor.

120
00:11:11,274 --> 00:11:15,607
Account #434690 I'd like
to liquidate my account.

121
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,498
My entire account, and purchase...

122
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:23,662
Bearer bonds.

123
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:28,310
- Mother's Maiden name, Mr. Luthor
- Mehan.

124
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:32,008
And what is your..

125
00:11:32,198 --> 00:11:36,122
Oh I'm sorry Mr. Luthor, there seems to
be a problem with your voice verification.

126
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,255
What?

127
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:39,347
Clark!

128
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:45,055
Martha!

129
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,501
I know you're practically a grown man Clark, but
please call me Mom no matter how old you are.

130
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:52,537
Sure... Sure.

131
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:55,005
Dinner's ready, but the way you're dressed
are you going out?

132
00:11:58,023 --> 00:12:02,857
Um, no, no, I justed wanted a change,
I'm bored with plaid.

133
00:12:04,588 --> 00:12:06,391
Well, I'll see you inside.

134
00:12:12,706 --> 00:12:14,295
Clark? What are you doing?

135
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:18,767
Well, I... I just...

136
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,429
Wanted to tell you how beautiful you
look today...

137
00:12:26,627 --> 00:12:27,691
Mom.

138
00:12:28,228 --> 00:12:31,810
Something is not right...

139
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:34,181
I can see it in your eyes.

140
00:12:36,748 --> 00:12:38,417
Is it because of that ringing you heard?

141
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,458
I don't know.

142
00:12:45,763 --> 00:12:47,156
I need a hug.

143
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:01,542
Clark!

144
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:09,133
What's gotten into you?

145
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:11,749
I, I don't know.

146
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:14,707
Well, jump down there and put it out!

147
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:16,412
Put it out?

148
00:13:18,117 --> 00:13:18,709
How?

149
00:13:19,993 --> 00:13:21,465
With your hands?

150
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:36,040
Hey mom... hehehe

151
00:13:38,377 --> 00:13:41,394
Hey! Hey, go upstairs and clean up!

152
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,447
Hey Clark! Look who came to
check up on you.

153
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,588
Hey.

154
00:13:52,472 --> 00:13:55,607
How are you feeling?
It's good to see you up and around.

155
00:13:56,273 --> 00:13:58,825
- I feel fine.
- You sure?

156
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,274
Cause you're looking at me like you have
absolutely no idea who I am.

157
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,470
No, I know who you are.
You're my... coach.

158
00:14:14,964 --> 00:14:17,387
Alright, well I guess I'll see you at
practice tomorrow.

159
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:21,454
You know, I'm not going to be able
to make it.

160
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:24,055
It's pretty important.

161
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:27,741
Considering you could clinch a
scholarship on Friday.

162
00:14:27,828 --> 00:14:31,431
Coach, I just...
I need to rethink my priorities.

163
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:33,634
I have no interest in football whatsoever.

164
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:39,227
Whoa, Clark, hey. You realize that every
player on that roster would kill

165
00:14:39,402 --> 00:14:41,519
to be in your position. You get a free
ride to the college of your choice.

166
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:42,884
You just want to quit the team?

167
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:44,237
Precisely.

168
00:14:55,156 --> 00:14:58,894
Edgar, I've got to make a call.
How do I do that?

169
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:02,962
Well, once a week, you get a turn, unless
you know how to work the system.

170
00:15:03,038 --> 00:15:04,613
Which of course I do.

171
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:07,665
Edgar, please.
I need you to help me.

172
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:09,478
What's in it for me?

173
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,938
I can get you out of here.

174
00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:14,524
C'mon, if the real Lionel Luthor can't do
it, what are you going to do?

175
00:15:14,658 --> 00:15:17,114
I mean, you have no money,
you have no power.

176
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:22,944
I have a lot more power than you think.

177
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,862
Time to play "Who Wants to
Beat a Billionaire"!

178
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,830
Yeah, here we go now!

179
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,761
You got my 5 large?

180
00:15:43,954 --> 00:15:46,603
What?

181
00:15:47,356 --> 00:15:48,618
What are you talking about?

182
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:51,921
That senile act isn't going to work,
Trump. Payment's past-due.

183
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:55,279
Things have changed. I don't have any
money. You'd have to...

184
00:16:02,072 --> 00:16:06,333
Don't play me, Trump. I'm doing
3 life terms for murder.

185
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:08,798
What's one more?

186
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:13,725
You got 'till tomorrow.

187
00:16:41,805 --> 00:16:44,358
Lex... changed the password.

188
00:16:48,202 --> 00:16:50,833
What, is flannel too 'five minutes ago'?

189
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,117
Whoa... who pulled a 'Paul Bunyan'
on the desk?

190
00:16:58,138 --> 00:17:00,254
It was that way when I got here.

191
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,649
Weird.

192
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:05,686
You know, Chloe, I'm concerned
about your well being.

193
00:17:05,754 --> 00:17:06,472
Oh yeah?

194
00:17:06,846 --> 00:17:08,103
Why is that?

195
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:14,740
If Lionel Luthor managed somehow to get
out of prison, what do you suppose he'd do?

196
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:16,386
About you I mean.

197
00:17:17,298 --> 00:17:21,316
Why? Has the Lionel Luthor alert suddenly
been elevated to 'orange'?

198
00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:25,732
Do you know something I don't?

199
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,126
No...
But it always pays to be cautious.

200
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:36,333
Well, I'm not exactly shaking in my
sneakers, I mean he won't be

201
00:17:36,459 --> 00:17:38,980
eligible for parole until he's like
112, so...

202
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:43,543
You never know, he could get out
sooner than you think.

203
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:48,094
Yeah well I think maybe our quarterback
has been sacked one too many times.

204
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,803
Maybe...

205
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:54,951
I do feel as though I'm looking through
a different pair of eyes.

206
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,020
I certainly see you in a whole new light.

207
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:00,784
Well, what exactly is that
supposed to mean?

208
00:18:01,486 --> 00:18:06,448
I have to confess that I... I find you
absolutely fascinating.

209
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:10,117
It's that twinkle...
in your eye.

210
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:15,222
Your wonderfully sexy smile.

211
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,280
And your skin, it's...

212
00:18:19,505 --> 00:18:21,724
Clark, what are you doing?

213
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,331
What I've wanted to do for a very...
very long time.

214
00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:39,265
Don't you wish...

215
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,733
Miss Sullivan.

216
00:18:53,303 --> 00:18:56,348
I did some research on the
Countess Thoreaux.

217
00:18:56,417 --> 00:19:00,419
It turns out that we have a lot more in
common than I thought.

218
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:03,670
Don't tell me the Countess ran
a coffee shop?

219
00:19:03,703 --> 00:19:09,549
No, she's from this village in France.
'Casa Neaux de Momiralle'

220
00:19:09,604 --> 00:19:12,952
Same village that my mom's ancestors
came from.

221
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:14,668
Really.

222
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:17,482
What do you think it all means?

223
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:22,429
I don't know. It's all really strange.

224
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:26,522
She was buried as a martyr... but,

225
00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:32,279
She was burned as a witch.

226
00:19:36,118 --> 00:19:41,491
Hey. We will figure this out.
I promise.

227
00:19:51,032 --> 00:19:52,992
Ladies.

228
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:55,820
Not bad!

229
00:19:56,747 --> 00:20:01,736
You are my main concern, Lana. We'll get
through this Countess thing together.

230
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:20,004
Oh please, don't stop on my account.

231
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:21,093
Clark, it's...

232
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:24,689
Oh, you don't have to explain yourself
to me... Lana.

233
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:28,321
You're young... vital... you have needs.

234
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:30,860
Right coach?

235
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,565
What do you think?

236
00:20:57,897 --> 00:20:59,463
I wanted to thank you...

237
00:20:59,513 --> 00:21:03,206
For taking time out of your
busy schedule, Mr. Luthor.

238
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:07,409
I understand how time-consuming
making license plates can be.

239
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:22,831
You're not going to touch me with that
rock in your hand.

240
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:27,352
You won't get near me.
Not with my... speed.

241
00:21:28,736 --> 00:21:30,200
You're never going to get away with this.

242
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,599
Oh but I am. With my mind, and
your body...

243
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:36,693
the sky's the limit... Clark.

244
00:21:39,984 --> 00:21:41,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

245
00:21:41,894 --> 00:21:45,510
You know it's becoming clear to me
why you're so secretive. you understand

246
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:49,172
that true power is better left concealed.

247
00:21:50,915 --> 00:21:54,259
No matter how hard you try,
you'll never be me.

248
00:21:54,348 --> 00:21:58,505
My parents... my friends...
they'll see right through you.

249
00:21:58,522 --> 00:22:02,071
I'm not so sure.
They haven't so far, have they?

250
00:22:02,713 --> 00:22:04,818
I need you to do something for me.

251
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:10,193
Say the name 'Mehan',
and these numbers...

252
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:13,490
Why?

253
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,880
Because if you don't,
your good friend Lex...

254
00:22:18,216 --> 00:22:21,684
will very shortly be dead.
An unfortunate accident...

255
00:22:21,784 --> 00:22:25,568
But he's your son!
Your only child!

256
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:29,360
And I'm his only father. But that didn't
stop him from putting me in prison,

257
00:22:29,397 --> 00:22:31,434
and robbing me of everything I have.

258
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,064
Now speak the words into the recorder

259
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,735
or you will be directly responsible
for your friend's death.

260
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:44,712
Your account number please.

261
00:22:45,441 --> 00:22:49,215
434690.

262
00:22:49,377 --> 00:22:52,037
May I please have your mother's maiden name?

263
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:53,608
Mehan.

264
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:57,492
Voice verification complete.

265
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,445
Account balance is $2.59.

266
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,796
No, no, there was 57 million
U.S. dollars in that account.

267
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:09,640
A withdrawal for that amount
was made two months ago.

268
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,221
The day I was convicted.

269
00:23:14,981 --> 00:23:18,495
Lex... of course.

270
00:23:18,546 --> 00:23:19,602
Clark?

271
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:24,203
This one.

272
00:23:24,304 --> 00:23:26,865
About last night.
Um...

273
00:23:27,715 --> 00:23:30,705
I'm sorry that you found out about
me and Jason the way that you did.

274
00:23:31,715 --> 00:23:32,893
You'll get over it.

275
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:41,934
We didn't just meet. He was in
Paris over the summer, and...

276
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:45,141
we sort of...
spent a lot of time together.

277
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:46,630
How romantic.

278
00:23:47,454 --> 00:23:50,870
Lovers meeting, first kiss shared
on the banks of the river Sienne.

279
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:57,637
He moved to Smallville
to be with me, Clark.

280
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,882
It's kind of serious.

281
00:24:04,771 --> 00:24:06,264
I'm not surprised.

282
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:15,465
A man would travel around the world
to... pluck your succulent fruit.

283
00:24:17,182 --> 00:24:19,094
Don't talk to me like that.

284
00:24:20,813 --> 00:24:23,353
I can't help it.
I'm sorry.

285
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,550
Clark I need you to promise
me something.

286
00:24:28,642 --> 00:24:29,918
Whatever you want.

287
00:24:29,939 --> 00:24:33,273
Don't tell anyone
about me and Jason.

288
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:38,319
I don't understand why you're so
interested in this high school football coach.

289
00:24:38,782 --> 00:24:40,070
Think a minute.

290
00:24:40,227 --> 00:24:42,505
Do you have any idea what
I have to offer you?

291
00:24:42,598 --> 00:24:45,280
Yeah, yeah I think I do.

292
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:49,477
Lies, and secrecy, and a whole
lot of confusion.

293
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:53,291
You're the one that broke up
with me, remember?

294
00:24:53,341 --> 00:24:57,726
Well that was a mistake, I was...
too young to know what I was doing

295
00:24:58,116 --> 00:25:00,293
I'm older now... more mature.

296
00:25:01,995 --> 00:25:03,634
Well I'm not so sure.

297
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:06,453
Oh Lana I'm very different,
let me show you.

298
00:25:11,939 --> 00:25:14,767
Who the hell do you think you are?

299
00:25:19,795 --> 00:25:24,933
Clark Kent...
of course.

300
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,068
Step in here, Miss.
Five minutes.

301
00:25:40,193 --> 00:25:41,585
I'm glad you came.

302
00:25:41,656 --> 00:25:44,965
I'm only here because you told me it
involves the safety of my son.

303
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:48,389
I know this is hard to believe,
but I swear it's the truth.

304
00:25:51,737 --> 00:25:53,774
It's me Mom...
its Clark.

305
00:25:54,101 --> 00:25:56,250
You're sick, Lionel.
You need help.

306
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,262
- Mom, you have to believe me.
- I'm leaving!

307
00:25:58,913 --> 00:26:02,799
Mom, mom, remember when I was 6,
and I was playing tag with Dad, and

308
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:07,595
all of a sudden I started running
faster than I'd ever run before,

309
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:09,922
and I was in the middle of Palmer
Woods, completely lost,

310
00:26:09,991 --> 00:26:12,817
and you and Dad had to call
Sheriff Ethan.

311
00:26:12,882 --> 00:26:14,906
And when you saw me
you started crying.

312
00:26:15,331 --> 00:26:17,935
And I thought something was wrong
with me, and you said "no there wasn't",

313
00:26:18,213 --> 00:26:22,497
and then you held me in your arms,
and you told me I was just special,

314
00:26:22,608 --> 00:26:25,206
I'm your special boy...

315
00:26:25,263 --> 00:26:27,003
Oh! Clark! How?

316
00:26:27,116 --> 00:26:31,088
The ringing I heard, it came from
a stone, it was in Lionel's hand,

317
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:36,519
and it had a Kryptonian symbol on it,
and it was glowing,

318
00:26:36,713 --> 00:26:40,445
and I thought it was going to hurt
Lex, so I got in between them,

319
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,693
and the next thing I know, I was... Lionel.

320
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,607
I was in Lionel's body.

321
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:51,108
And he knows about your powers.

322
00:26:51,353 --> 00:26:55,615
Mom, be careful.
Lionel could be anywhere.

323
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:03,228
Crunching numbers?
Or spinning daydreams?

324
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:12,575
I don't remember you being a Scotch drinker.

325
00:27:12,856 --> 00:27:15,911
It's very difficult to resist a
29 year-old Thailand.

326
00:27:19,974 --> 00:27:23,520
You know I had a feeling you'd pillage
your father's collection of single malts.

327
00:27:24,237 --> 00:27:25,940
Now how do you know it's
from my dad?

328
00:27:27,336 --> 00:27:28,874
Isn't it all your dad's?

329
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:33,639
This castle? Luthorcorp, the cars,
the jets, everything

330
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,373
to the very cuff-links
in your sleeves.

331
00:27:39,044 --> 00:27:43,811
Clark, I know you well enough to
realize this isn't you talking.

332
00:27:44,165 --> 00:27:46,701
You're absolutely right,
I'm not myself.

333
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:54,651
I'm under stress.

334
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:00,049
Lex, I need to get my hands on
$57 million dollars.

335
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,300
That's an interesting dollar amount.

336
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,732
It's not your money, you stole it.

337
00:28:08,712 --> 00:28:10,806
Now I want it back.

338
00:28:22,064 --> 00:28:25,530
Now get on the phone, tell the bank
to wire the money

339
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:28,222
or I'll snap your larynx like a twig.

340
00:28:30,165 --> 00:28:34,649
- Go ahead, kill me.
- All I wanted was the best for you...

341
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:37,131
and you destroyed me.

342
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,498
Dad?

343
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:51,071
Lex!

344
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,081
Hello.

345
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,264
I've been trying to reach you.
Where have you been?

346
00:29:07,425 --> 00:29:10,917
Hi sweetheart. I was at the mechanic's,
the tractor, I'm afraid it's shot.

347
00:29:11,438 --> 00:29:15,369
Jonathan, listen to me. You've got to go
to the closet and get a meteor rock.

348
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:20,110
- What are you talking about Martha?
- Lionel is in Clark's body!

349
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:23,557
I thought I was invulnerable now,
but I was wrong.

350
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:24,493
Jonathan!

351
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:29,897
- Tell me what weakens me. What is it?
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

352
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:46,751
Tell me what it is, Jonathan.

353
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:50,392
No Martha can't help you now,
tell me what it is!

354
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:52,381
Hi, you've reached the Kents.
Leave a message.

355
00:29:52,932 --> 00:29:57,630
Does this thing work? Hello?
I'm calling for someone named Clark?

356
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:01,640
Houston, we have a problem!

357
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:06,156
I've done some more reading, and it's
not good, so I hope you're getting this,

358
00:30:06,874 --> 00:30:09,454
cause you should come see me,
A.S.A.P.

359
00:30:15,703 --> 00:30:18,551
- Is that really you in there Lionel?
- No, it's the Easter Bunny.

360
00:30:19,112 --> 00:30:21,104
What did you find, what did
the rest of the codes say?

361
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:26,435
Turns out, the transferrence is
eventually going to come to an end.

362
00:30:27,181 --> 00:30:30,312
You will revert back to your
original bodies, eventually.

363
00:30:30,734 --> 00:30:33,283
- When?
- Suppose it could happen at anytime,

364
00:30:33,425 --> 00:30:35,408
Yeah, I thought you'd want
to know that.

365
00:30:35,453 --> 00:30:37,100
There must be some way to
make it permanent.

366
00:30:37,442 --> 00:30:39,746
Well, none that I see...

367
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:41,730
Save murder.

368
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:47,537
Theoretically speaking, if you were to
kill the other you, then

369
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:52,132
there would be no 'you' to revert back
to, so I suppose you could be Clark Kent

370
00:30:52,244 --> 00:30:56,622
for the rest of your life... his life,
your life, the difference is nil...

371
00:30:56,695 --> 00:30:58,436
The artifact, where is it?

372
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,916
Guards took it from me, yeah
they thought it was a weapon.

373
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,075
Time's up, Trump.
Got something for me?

374
00:31:15,361 --> 00:31:18,346
Yeah I'm still working on it.
Just give me a few more days.

375
00:31:18,496 --> 00:31:22,244
You think this is some kind of game?
There's no overtime here.

376
00:31:22,525 --> 00:31:25,492
But there is Sudden Death.

377
00:31:31,262 --> 00:31:33,049
Way to go, man!

378
00:31:46,927 --> 00:31:48,026
Get him!

379
00:32:00,553 --> 00:32:05,698
This is a lockdown! I repeat, this is a
lockdown! Return to your cells immediately!

380
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,544
Go, go, go!

381
00:32:29,192 --> 00:32:34,038
Oh, that's no good. Listen your lawyers,
they haven't been calling so...

382
00:32:34,316 --> 00:32:36,157
should I call you?

383
00:33:33,372 --> 00:33:36,070
What happened to concealing your powers?

384
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:39,330
Sorry, only one Clark allowed.

385
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:44,302
What are you going to do? Go to High
School? Stack hay for the rest of your life?

386
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:49,569
A farm boy? I don't think so. I have big
plans for this 'Clark Kent. '

387
00:35:14,148 --> 00:35:16,457
What else did Lionel do?

388
00:35:17,925 --> 00:35:20,753
Well, for starters...
you quit the football team.

389
00:35:22,758 --> 00:35:24,440
I better call coach Teague.

390
00:35:25,017 --> 00:35:29,526
He's not the only one. Lana and Chloe came
to see you and they both looked pretty upset.

391
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:33,560
Before I do any of that, I've
got to get that artifact

392
00:35:33,607 --> 00:35:35,959
Clark, I don't want you going anywhere
near that prison, son.

393
00:35:36,151 --> 00:35:37,451
If I don't find it, Lionel could.

394
00:35:37,478 --> 00:35:40,050
You can't risk having the same thing
happen to you all over again.

395
00:35:42,328 --> 00:35:44,872
Look, this isn't the first time
I heard the ringing sound.

396
00:35:46,287 --> 00:35:50,263
When I was Kal-El, I heard the same
sound, and it led me to an artifact with

397
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:53,295
a Kryptonian symbol on it, in Lex's jet.

398
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:55,744
Where's the artifact now, Clark?

399
00:35:56,136 --> 00:35:59,723
I put it in a chamber in the cave wall.
There's a slot for two more, and

400
00:35:59,771 --> 00:36:02,035
Lionel's artifact matches one of them.

401
00:36:02,354 --> 00:36:03,716
I don't know where the other one is.

402
00:36:04,063 --> 00:36:06,973
Why didn't you tell us about this earlier?

403
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:09,739
With everything we've been through with
Jor-El, I just wanted to

404
00:36:09,784 --> 00:36:11,658
close that chapter in my life.

405
00:36:12,868 --> 00:36:15,100
Guess it doesn't matter what I want.

406
00:36:17,658 --> 00:36:20,267
Look, these artifacts. I think
they're somehow meant for me.

407
00:36:20,338 --> 00:36:22,823
And I think Lionel Luthor would disagree
with that, don't you?

408
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:26,224
And now that he knows about your powers,
he's more dangerous than ever.

409
00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:28,047
Not for long.

410
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:29,876
Clark, what are you talking about?

411
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:32,353
Lionel Luthor's dying, Dad.

412
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:39,139
It couldn't be...

413
00:36:39,882 --> 00:36:43,492
Doctor, please just... tell me.

414
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:50,234
Mr. Luthor, your liver is
entirely disease-free.

415
00:36:56,975 --> 00:36:58,921
How can that be possible?

416
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,551
I have no idea.

417
00:37:00,728 --> 00:37:03,650
It's the closest thing to a miracle
I've ever seen.

418
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:07,276
Have you been taking any unregulated
meds... supplements?

419
00:37:07,469 --> 00:37:10,250
No.
Not that I know of.

420
00:37:10,816 --> 00:37:15,481
You must understand I have no recollection
of the past few days, Doctor, I just...

421
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:20,834
know that, something... here, something,

422
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:25,952
inside of me, has changed.

423
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:30,351
profoundly.

424
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:35,231
I'm not... the same man.

425
00:37:42,018 --> 00:37:45,126
Chloe, listen I'm not really sure
what I did to you.

426
00:37:45,146 --> 00:37:47,030
Another convenient case
of amnesia, huh?

427
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,098
No, but whatever it is,
I'm really sorry.

428
00:37:49,157 --> 00:37:51,801
Clark, you know what? It's a really
valiant effort, but you've used up

429
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:54,163
your lifetime allotment
of apologies.

430
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,560
Look. I'm only saying this to you because
I care about you, but I think you should

431
00:37:57,622 --> 00:37:59,454
go and look for help.

432
00:37:59,938 --> 00:38:02,334
Some psychological help.

433
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,762
Chloe, I totally appreciate you
looking out for me,

434
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,769
but I really don't think
I need to talk to anyone

435
00:38:06,922 --> 00:38:10,147
Well then how are you going to explain
all of this, Clark Kent "Crackhead"?

436
00:38:10,169 --> 00:38:12,490
Chloe, I don't do drugs,
look it wasn't me!

437
00:38:12,518 --> 00:38:15,703
Yeah, but see Clark, it was you! Now a lot
of people in this town have

438
00:38:15,828 --> 00:38:18,917
pulled a 'Jeckyl and Hyde' but deep down,
they're still the same person.

439
00:38:20,596 --> 00:38:22,950
Lana. He's all yours.

440
00:38:25,272 --> 00:38:27,218
Have you said anything to anyone?

441
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,603
- What?
- Don't play games with me, Clark.

442
00:38:31,697 --> 00:38:34,492
Seriously Lana, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

443
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,985
This isn't about you and me, alright?

444
00:38:38,347 --> 00:38:40,863
This is about Jason losing his job.

445
00:38:41,294 --> 00:38:43,080
Why would Jason lose his job?

446
00:38:43,147 --> 00:38:47,581
Why do you think? If anyone had the
slightest inkling that we were a couple,

447
00:38:47,855 --> 00:38:50,200
he'd be fired in a heartbeat.

448
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,280
You and Jason?

449
00:38:52,669 --> 00:38:55,225
We're both adults, and we're
not hurting anybody.

450
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:57,721
But the school has it's rules.

451
00:38:59,435 --> 00:39:01,345
He needs this job, Clark.

452
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:07,575
Please, after everything you've put me
through, can you at least keep this a secret?

453
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:14,077
It seems to be the one thing
that you're good at.

454
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:17,538
Yeah.

455
00:39:31,618 --> 00:39:32,561
Lex!

456
00:39:33,183 --> 00:39:35,309
Stay where you are!

457
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:39,874
Lex, it's me, Clark.

458
00:39:40,699 --> 00:39:42,010
I need to talk to you.

459
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:45,589
After I drove my Porsche into the river
and you fished me out, I asked your Dad

460
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,405
if there was any way I could repay him.
What'd he say that we always joke about?

461
00:39:49,459 --> 00:39:50,720
Lex, what is this, a pop quiz?

462
00:39:50,745 --> 00:39:51,913
Answer the question!

463
00:39:54,956 --> 00:39:56,416
He told you to drive slower.

464
00:40:01,013 --> 00:40:03,211
Welcome back.

465
00:40:09,596 --> 00:40:11,873
So you know what happened?

466
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:17,270
Well, it was a bit of a giveaway when you
asked for $57 million dollars.

467
00:40:21,235 --> 00:40:24,034
Lex, my mom told me what I did,
and I'm sorry.

468
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:27,474
Clark, if you didn't come between me and
my father in that visiting room,

469
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,864
it would've been me sitting behind bars.
I should be thanking you.

470
00:40:31,314 --> 00:40:34,207
I didn't do anything you wouldn't
have done for me.

471
00:40:38,411 --> 00:40:40,447
So how did my father do it?

472
00:40:41,443 --> 00:40:43,153
I... I don't know.

473
00:40:45,044 --> 00:40:49,000
That strength you had.
It was incredible.

474
00:40:49,499 --> 00:40:51,438
Where did it come from?

475
00:40:52,978 --> 00:40:56,295
Um, must have been a side effect
of the transferrence.

476
00:40:57,248 --> 00:41:00,463
Well, whatever happened,
I'm just glad it wore off.

477
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:03,552
Lex, I have a favor to ask.

478
00:41:03,831 --> 00:41:05,236
Name it.

479
00:41:05,711 --> 00:41:08,176
Well, it has to do with your
father's cellmate.

480
00:41:08,276 --> 00:41:12,449
He's actually the one that helped me
through this whole ordeal, he saved my life.

481
00:41:13,936 --> 00:41:16,267
He swears he was framed.

482
00:41:16,362 --> 00:41:19,545
Clark, a lot of convicts swear
they've been framed.

483
00:41:19,797 --> 00:41:24,407
But I believe him. And I promised him
that if I got out, I'd do everything in

484
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,840
my power to help him. And Lex, you're the
only one I know with the resources

485
00:41:27,854 --> 00:41:29,861
that might be able to help.

486
00:41:33,974 --> 00:41:37,275
Well, if I can manage to put a
guilty man in prison...

487
00:41:38,146 --> 00:41:40,635
maybe I can get an innocent man out.

488
00:42:13,411 --> 00:42:15,411
I was told that it was going to be..

489
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:17,698
- Edgar.
- Yes?

490
00:42:17,698 --> 00:42:19,727
Do you have what we asked you for?

491
00:42:24,372 --> 00:42:25,827
Thank you.

492
00:42:33,015 --> 00:42:34,750
Nice car.
