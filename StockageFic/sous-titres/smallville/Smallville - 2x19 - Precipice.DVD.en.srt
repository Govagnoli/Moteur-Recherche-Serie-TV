1
00:00:08,661 --> 00:00:10,498
Okay, okay, here we go.

2
00:00:10,498 --> 00:00:12,363
Oh yeah.

3
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:18,822
Sorry, guys, but the coffee
here is strictly non-Irish.

4
00:00:18,822 --> 00:00:20,421
Oh, come on, loosen up.

5
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:22,520
Yeah, have a drink!

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,942
If that's what I think it is,
you're gonna have to take it outside.

7
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:30,340
Besides we're closing.

8
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:40,016
Can I get you anything else?

9
00:00:40,016 --> 00:00:41,985
Just a boyfriend who can keep a date.

10
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:46,639
You're definitely talking to the wrong person.

11
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,688
Dr. Bryce, are you sure you're okay?

12
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:06,257
Yeah, I just thought I saw someone I knew.

13
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:09,979
But it's late. I better be going.
Thanks, Lana.

14
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:13,624
No problem. Bye.

15
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,103
Go get her.

16
00:01:16,103 --> 00:01:18,831
Hey.

17
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:23,834
We heard this place had
the friendliest service in town.

18
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:24,869
Just leave.

19
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,904
Ah. That's no way
to talk to a customer.

20
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:33,604
Hey!

21
00:01:33,604 --> 00:01:36,074
Aaah!

22
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:46,249
Why don't we take this into the back
and have a private party?

23
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:50,351
Stop! Get away from her!

24
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:58,321
Isn't it past your bedtime?

25
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:04,571
Look, the police are on their way.
Right now.

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,391
Come on. Let's go.

27
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:21,896
Lana, are you okay?

28
00:02:21,896 --> 00:02:24,021
Yeah.

29
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:33,285
- Did you see the stupid look on her face?
- Yeah!

30
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:37,661
Check out Speedy Gonzalez.

31
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:41,335
I don't want to see any of you
in the Talon again. Got it?

32
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:42,963
Listen, John Boy.

33
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,428
We'll do whatever the hell we want.

34
00:02:45,428 --> 00:02:50,404
As a matter of fact, we were thinking
about stopping by tomorrow.

35
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,722
I won't tell you again.

36
00:02:51,722 --> 00:02:56,099
Oh, I get it. You got
the hots for that bitch manager.

37
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:00,247
It's too bad she's
a real dirty slut.

38
00:03:09,777 --> 00:03:12,423
All right. You want to
try it on, farm boy?

39
00:03:12,423 --> 00:03:15,102
Let's see what you're made of.

40
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:21,858
Get your coffee somewhere else.

41
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,353
On your knees.

42
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:41,110
Hands behind your head.
Now.

43
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,808
Now!

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON WB:  2003/4/22

56
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:51,726
So you're the new sheriff in town.

57
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:54,951
You writing a book, Mr. Kent?

58
00:04:55,876 --> 00:04:58,395
No, ma'am.

59
00:04:58,395 --> 00:05:02,531
Then keep the chitter chatter to yourself.

60
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:08,982
Flying boys.

61
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:13,746
Flying boys aren't something
you see every day.

62
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,823
That young man told me
you attacked him and his friends,

63
00:05:16,823 --> 00:05:19,053
then you threw him 30 feet onto my car.

64
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:20,300
That's crazy.

65
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:27,195
Then how come the paramedics were all over
them and there's not a scratch on you, huh?

66
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:29,854
What about you, Miss Lang?

67
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,435
What'd you see?

68
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:35,992
Nothing.

69
00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:38,342
You're lying, you know.

70
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:40,693
Excuse me?

71
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:44,821
You said you made a good cappuccino.

72
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:50,487
This is a great cappuccino.

73
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:55,463
- Looks like we're done here.
- No, Mr. Kent.

74
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:57,816
Mnh-mnh.

75
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,875
We are just getting started.

76
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:06,153
Sheriff, we know our son and

77
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:07,814
Clark would never deliberately hurt anybody.

78
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:10,984
I'm sure whatever he did,
he did it 'cause he thought he had to.

79
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:15,640
By throwing another young man
across my police car?

80
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,764
I ran a complete check on your son, Mr. Kent.

81
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:21,733
He's been at more crime
scenes than Eliot Ness.

82
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:26,208
If Clark's been involved with police business,
it's only because he was trying to help people.

83
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,315
Or maybe he's got some
kind of hero complex?

84
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:30,344
I mean, even heroes got to play by the rules.

85
00:06:30,344 --> 00:06:33,079
And that is why I'm charging him
with misdemeanor battery.

86
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,714
What exactly does that mean?

87
00:06:34,714 --> 00:06:37,360
Could be a $1500-dollar fine.
Depends on the judge.

88
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,269
I'm sorry, but we can't afford that.

89
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:43,935
Clark, sit down.

90
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,449
I'll make you a deal, Mr. Kent.

91
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:56,551
I won't charge you if you are
willing to do the community service,

92
00:06:56,551 --> 00:07:00,086
and then you can keep the world
save from roadside litter.

93
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,460
Wait just a minute, how--

94
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,317
Your former sheriff?

95
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:06,746
He may have looked way the
other way on these matters,

96
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:08,641
but I'm here to tell you.

97
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:12,924
Those good ol' boy days are over.

98
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:22,522
Nighty-night.

99
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:54,454
Metropolis Flower Show, 1999.
You couldn't take your eyes off of them.

100
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:56,356
Paul?

101
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:58,645
Dr. Bryce.

102
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,815
I thought I saw you last night.

103
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:02,014
You did.

104
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:07,793
And I was gonna say hi, but it was really late
and you didn't look like you wanted any company.

105
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:09,860
What are you doing in Smallville?

106
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,900
I'm here on business,

107
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,849
and I read that you were getting married.

108
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:18,159
You shouldn't believe everything you read.

109
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:20,688
Right now, Lex and I are
married to our careers.

110
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:23,175
At least that's what we tell each other.

111
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:27,720
Lex. I'd like you to meet
an old friend of mine, Paul Hayden.

112
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,973
Hey.

113
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:33,300
I take it you two knew each
other from Metropolis.

114
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,257
Well, we actually dated for
a while in med school

115
00:08:37,257 --> 00:08:40,671
until we realized we weren't
gonna live happily ever after.

116
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:44,320
At least not with each other.

117
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:50,059
Well, Paul it was nice seeing you.

118
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:52,561
- Lex and I are just on our way out to lunch.
- Actually,

119
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:56,183
I stopped by to tell you
I can't make it. I'm sorry.

120
00:08:56,183 --> 00:09:01,461
Well, maybe I can fill in?
You know, if it's okay with Lex.

121
00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:05,957
I'm sure you two have
a lot of catching up to do.

122
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:12,630
Patient emergency. I'll have to
take a rain check on that lunch.

123
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,029
Why don't you give Lex the number where you're
staying and we'll make a plan to get together?

124
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:20,156
Yeah, sounds great.

125
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,438
Same old Helen.

126
00:09:27,438 --> 00:09:32,429
One minute she's here,
the next she's gone.

127
00:09:32,717 --> 00:09:35,632
Hang on to her Lex...

128
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:38,430
if you can.

129
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:42,280
Clark Kent, convict.

130
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,029
Yeah, I know, when do you get
fit for that orange jump suit?

131
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:47,181
Or is it one size fits all?

132
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:49,999
Forty hours of community
service is not funny.

133
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:51,161
It's an orange vest.

134
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:53,790
Oh, no! It's gonna
clash with the plaid!

135
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,339
Welcome to Smallville, where you
stop the crime, you do the time.

136
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:01,160
Very pithy.

137
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:05,966
Maybe I should use that
as my campaign slogan, huh?

138
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:10,313
Oh. We're gonna see you
bright and early, Mr. Kent.

139
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:11,740
I'm looking forward to it.

140
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,156
Yeah.
Tootle-oo.

141
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,546
Good luck on the chain gang.

142
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:25,330
Hey, Lana.
What's wrong?

143
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,163
According to the sheriff I don't
have a case that'll hold up in court.

144
00:10:28,163 --> 00:10:31,673
It's all hearsay.

145
00:10:32,494 --> 00:10:34,111
At least you were there, Clark.

146
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,950
Yeah. Look where it got me.

147
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,489
Sorry.

148
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:48,222
So, how'd you do it, Clark?

149
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:54,675
I mean, I know you can take care of yourself,
but there were three of them.

150
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:58,518
They were drunk.

151
00:10:58,518 --> 00:11:00,191
And I was highly motivated.

152
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:03,106
I mean, the thought of
someone hurting you...

153
00:11:03,106 --> 00:11:06,829
You can't keep your eye
on my every second.

154
00:11:07,109 --> 00:11:10,428
I can try.

155
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:14,475
You're always there to save me.

156
00:11:14,475 --> 00:11:19,410
I just wish for once
I could've saved myself.

157
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:46,249
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

158
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:48,852
No, it's okay. I guess
I'm still a little jumpy.

159
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:51,404
It's understandable.
You had quite an ordeal.

160
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:53,932
I just feel so stupid.
It's not like I was even hurt.

161
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:56,780
No, no, this place has always
been a safe haven for you.

162
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,864
Now that's been violated.

163
00:11:58,864 --> 00:12:02,683
So now what?
Become a shut-in?

164
00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:05,920
Lana, I know what it's
like to feel vulnerable.

165
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,733
You?

166
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:12,372
Trust me. Eccentric bald kids sit pretty low
on the prep school totem pole.

167
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:17,457
I was bullied for years,
till one day I decided I had enough.

168
00:12:17,457 --> 00:12:19,196
What'd you do?

169
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,835
One of my father's chauffeurs
was an ex-Navy SEAL.

170
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:26,860
I convinced him to teach me to fight.

171
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:32,030
Let's just say the next time I was cornered the
guy ended up needing serious dental work.

172
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,607
I could never hurt anybody.

173
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:35,650
It's not about hurting people.

174
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,938
It's about reclaiming your sense
of control over your life.

175
00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:42,946
Isn't that what you want?

176
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:49,987
One million dollars.

177
00:12:49,987 --> 00:12:52,026
The sheriff said he had
a few cuts and bruises.

178
00:12:52,026 --> 00:12:54,424
Now he's claiming to have
severe neck injury.

179
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:57,250
"Punitive damages, pain and suffering,
loss of future earnings"?

180
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,225
They're saying Andy's mobility
may be permanently limited and

181
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:02,585
they've hired the best personal
injury attorney in the state.

182
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:06,340
You did throw him into that car, Clark.

183
00:13:07,665 --> 00:13:09,478
Maybe this is where it all starts.

184
00:13:09,478 --> 00:13:10,936
Remember what it said in the spaceship?

185
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:15,070
"They're a flawed race.
Rule them with strength."

186
00:13:16,908 --> 00:13:18,933
Son,

187
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:22,011
I got into a lot of fights when
I was your age too, believe me.

188
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:25,798
But, Clark, these are not alien feelings.

189
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:31,063
What you have to remember under these
circumstances is that there are consequences.

190
00:13:31,063 --> 00:13:32,050
Your father's right.

191
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,879
You don't make decisions in a split second
you have to live with for the rest of your life.

192
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:38,830
Clark, it's true.
We are a flawed race, sure.

193
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,196
But we're a flawed race that raised you.

194
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:46,040
You're a lot more human than you think.

195
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:10,271
Lex, it still won't start.

196
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,445
How far way are you?

197
00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:18,229
Okay.

198
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:21,516
I'll see you in a sec.

199
00:14:26,223 --> 00:14:28,636
You always had the worst luck with cars.

200
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:31,147
Paul.

201
00:14:33,143 --> 00:14:34,794
What are you doing here?

202
00:14:34,794 --> 00:14:36,692
It must be kismet.

203
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:39,441
I dropped my cell phone, came back
to get it, and here you were.

204
00:14:39,441 --> 00:14:40,926
How about I give you a ride home?

205
00:14:40,926 --> 00:14:42,453
Lex is on his way.

206
00:14:42,453 --> 00:14:46,153
Come on, Helen, why wait?

207
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:50,809
Same old Helen.

208
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:52,691
Never wanted my help.

209
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,158
Must be different with Lex, huh?

210
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:57,697
Yes, it is.

211
00:15:00,337 --> 00:15:03,618
Here comes Prince Charming now.

212
00:15:03,618 --> 00:15:05,486
Helen,

213
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:06,860
is everything all right?

214
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,614
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah? Hey.

215
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:14,286
Hello, Paul.
I didn't expect to see you here.

216
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:16,389
I happened to be in the neighborhood.

217
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:21,777
Twice in one day. Three times
if you count last night.

218
00:15:21,777 --> 00:15:24,395
Careful. I might start to think
you're stalking my girlfriend.

219
00:15:24,395 --> 00:15:25,829
Come on, let's go.

220
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:28,396
Why would I want to do that?

221
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:30,543
You're not over her.

222
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:32,801
I was just trying to be a good Samaritan.

223
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:34,761
So when my mechanic looks over this car,

224
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:38,732
he's not gonna find missing spark plugs
or sugar in the gas tank?

225
00:15:38,732 --> 00:15:41,077
Lex, enough.

226
00:15:41,077 --> 00:15:43,845
You really are paranoid.

227
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:45,968
No.

228
00:15:45,968 --> 00:15:50,956
No, I'm just a frighteningly
good judge of character.

229
00:15:51,203 --> 00:15:56,340
I strongly suggest you stay away from Helen.

230
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,532
Whoa. Is that a threat?

231
00:16:00,305 --> 00:16:04,621
You seem like a simple guy, Paul.

232
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:09,214
I'd hate for your life to get complicated.

233
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:03,326
He's back at the motel, Mr. Luthor.

234
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:15,707
You know I love you, Helen.

235
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:23,462
And you know that I would do
anything to be with you.

236
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:28,932
I do mean anything.

237
00:17:51,997 --> 00:17:53,383
Paul.

238
00:17:53,383 --> 00:17:55,574
Helen...

239
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,387
What happened to you?

240
00:17:57,387 --> 00:18:00,372
Lex.

241
00:18:01,418 --> 00:18:04,472
Lex did this to me.

242
00:18:17,707 --> 00:18:21,424
Lex, we need to talk.

243
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:28,896
What's going on?

244
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:30,584
Paul claims you had him beaten up.

245
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:34,114
And from the tone of your voice,
it sounds like you believe him.

246
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,142
For two weeks now you've
been ignoring me.

247
00:18:36,142 --> 00:18:37,952
Suddenly Paul shows up
and your jealous.

248
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:40,228
I'm not jealous. I'm concerned.

249
00:18:40,228 --> 00:18:43,701
Especially about someone who's
unhinged enough to do that to himself.

250
00:18:43,701 --> 00:18:46,673
Helen, he's clearly stalking you.

251
00:18:46,673 --> 00:18:49,776
You know, I don't understand it.
I mean, we were never that serious.

252
00:18:49,776 --> 00:18:53,401
It was a relationship of convenience.
There was no heavy emotional involvement.

253
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:56,373
Could've fooled him.

254
00:18:56,977 --> 00:18:59,749
- Who broke it off?
- I did.

255
00:18:59,749 --> 00:19:02,759
One of his ex-girlfriends warned
me to stay away from him.

256
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:05,737
She claimed that he beat her up.

257
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:07,485
Did she ever report him to the police?

258
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:11,645
No. But I wasn't gonna wait around
to see if history repeated itself.

259
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:14,894
So I broke it off and we
never spoke after that.

260
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:17,909
Three months later
he dropped out of school.

261
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:21,827
Mr. Luthor.

262
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:26,020
You're just the man I was looking for.

263
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,182
I didn't have Paul Hayden beaten up.

264
00:19:29,182 --> 00:19:31,948
You know, I usually like to ask the
questions before I get the answers.

265
00:19:31,948 --> 00:19:35,485
Kind of the natural flow of things.
Where were you earlier this evening?

266
00:19:35,485 --> 00:19:37,726
At home.
A fact my staff can confirm.

267
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:40,999
Uh-huh, so you did not threaten Paul
Hayden in the medical center parking lot?

268
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:42,041
He's stalking my girlfriend.

269
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,387
Well, according to him, he offered
her some flowers, a ride home.

270
00:19:44,387 --> 00:19:45,918
That's not exactly criminal behavior.

271
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:49,304
Listen, Sheriff, if you want to play Letter
of the Law, you go right ahead.

272
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:52,174
I just hope your professional instincts
lead you back in the right direction.

273
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:54,381
Oh, don't worry.

274
00:19:54,381 --> 00:19:57,281
They always do, Mr. Luthor.

275
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:00,175
I'll stay in touch.

276
00:20:36,707 --> 00:20:39,825
- Good morning, Clark.
- Look, don't even start.

277
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:43,331
I've had half of Smallville High out here
already giving me a hard time.

278
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:47,015
Would it be, uh, violating your parole
to take a coffee break?

279
00:20:47,015 --> 00:20:49,858
It'd be the least of my problems.

280
00:20:49,858 --> 00:20:52,103
That kid who harassed Lana is suing us.

281
00:20:52,103 --> 00:20:53,500
He could literally take the farm.

282
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,244
It's hard to believe someone could come
into your life and just screw it up.

283
00:20:57,244 --> 00:21:01,705
Lana's a wreck, I'm picking up trash,
and this guy's walking around free.

284
00:21:01,705 --> 00:21:04,118
I wouldn't worry too much about Lana.

285
00:21:04,118 --> 00:21:06,062
Why's that?

286
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:12,048
Let's just say the crouching tigress
is about to find her hidden dragon.

287
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:16,494
I can't even get the bag to move.

288
00:21:16,494 --> 00:21:18,829
I don't see how I'm supposed to take
on a guy who's twice my size.

289
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:22,275
Lana, getting the upper
hand isn't about size.

290
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:24,718
It's about decisiveness and speed.

291
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:26,464
You have to commit.

292
00:21:26,464 --> 00:21:28,417
Look, right now you're only
putting part of yourself into it.

293
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:30,688
If you want to effective,

294
00:21:30,688 --> 00:21:32,951
you have to put your
whole body into it.

295
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:35,381
- Okay?
- Okay.

296
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,074
There you go. That's it.
Now channel all your anger.

297
00:21:42,074 --> 00:21:45,613
Some of us aren't as
angry as you are, Lex.

298
00:21:45,613 --> 00:21:47,148
Of course not.

299
00:21:47,148 --> 00:21:51,370
I mean, what's to be angry about?
Hmm?

300
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:56,874
It's not like a bunch of frat boys came
into your own place and harassed you.

301
00:21:56,874 --> 00:22:00,803
It's not like you felt helpless
when that guy shoved you.

302
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:08,532
And I know it doesn't make you mad that
you needed Clark Kent to save you again.

303
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:14,183
Better.

304
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:32,030
Andy.

305
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,151
Whoa, whoa.

306
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:36,192
Restraining order says you can't
come within 500 feet of me, Kent.

307
00:22:36,192 --> 00:22:37,704
I just want to talk.

308
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:39,857
Anything you got to say,
you can say to my lawyer.

309
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:42,739
- Well, let me apologize.
- It's too late!

310
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:43,575
What?

311
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:45,706
Look, we both made
mistakes the other night.

312
00:22:45,706 --> 00:22:48,913
And I understand that you're mad at me,
but this lawsuit could ruin my family.

313
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:52,347
Just leave them out of it.

314
00:22:56,836 --> 00:22:58,755
I'll see you in court,

315
00:22:58,755 --> 00:23:05,026
and if you break this restraining order again,
I'll have the sheriff all over your ass!

316
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:18,109
Man, don't hurt yourself.

317
00:23:40,846 --> 00:23:42,139
What's up?

318
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:45,005
Andy Connors is faking his injuries.

319
00:23:45,005 --> 00:23:48,803
Well, that's an intriguing claim, but as the
defendant, I doubt your case holds much water.

320
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:53,036
Well, I... I followed him home.
I saw him take his neck brace off.

321
00:23:53,036 --> 00:23:55,330
I was trying to gather some evidence
on him so I could nail him.

322
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,379
Well, you know I'm always
up for a good conspiracy.

323
00:23:57,379 --> 00:23:59,130
Thanks, Chloe.

324
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:05,487
Or if all else fails, we could send Lana
out to beat the confession out of him.

325
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:09,072
It was a joke, Clark.

326
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:13,374
Why do I get the feeling that you're not impressed
with Lana turning all Charlie's Angels on us?

327
00:24:13,374 --> 00:24:16,213
I know Lex's intentions are good.

328
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:20,481
But what if she gets overconfident and finds
herself in a situation she can't handle?

329
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:21,583
Clark,

330
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:24,778
as a 6-foot-whatever guy,

331
00:24:24,778 --> 00:24:29,285
you have no idea what it feels like to have to cross the
street at night when you hear footsteps behind you.

332
00:24:29,285 --> 00:24:35,692
If getting a little girl power makes Lana feel like
less of a victim, then you should be all for it.

333
00:24:35,692 --> 00:24:37,426
I guess.

334
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:40,673
Or is it that you're secretly worried that
if Lana learns to defend herself,

335
00:24:40,673 --> 00:24:45,768
she won't need a knight in shining
armor to rescue her anymore?

336
00:25:25,096 --> 00:25:27,805
Doctor?

337
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:32,629
Paul.

338
00:25:32,629 --> 00:25:34,732
What are you doing here?

339
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:38,296
I had to see you alone.

340
00:25:38,296 --> 00:25:42,072
All right, well, why don't we go upstairs
and we can talk about it over coffee?

341
00:25:42,072 --> 00:25:46,732
No, we can't go and have coffee,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

342
00:25:46,732 --> 00:25:50,532
When you broke up with me,
I thought that it was because

343
00:25:50,532 --> 00:25:53,159
you knew I was never
gonna be a great doctor.

344
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:55,970
You were right.
That's why I quit.

345
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,901
If you can't be great, why bother at all?
That's what you always used to say, right?

346
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,923
Paul...

347
00:26:01,923 --> 00:26:05,246
I was working on becoming successful

348
00:26:05,246 --> 00:26:08,333
so that I could have you back!

349
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:11,703
Then I found out that you were with Luthor

350
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:15,755
and I knew that I had
to save you from that fraud.

351
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:18,856
I don't want you to save me.

352
00:26:18,856 --> 00:26:21,962
Look, I broke up with you because
you beat your ex-girlfriend.

353
00:26:21,962 --> 00:26:25,906
Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
She was so beneath me.

354
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:31,807
That's not the case with you and I.
You and I were meant for each other.

355
00:26:32,052 --> 00:26:35,094
I love Lex.

356
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,961
No.

357
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:38,789
You don't.

358
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:43,294
You love me.
You just don't know it yet.

359
00:26:43,294 --> 00:26:46,489
Get away from me, Paul!

360
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:53,404
Hello?

361
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,235
Helen, it's me.

362
00:26:55,235 --> 00:26:58,084
Look, you're right, I've
been distant the last few weeks,

363
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:00,671
but that's gonna change.

364
00:27:00,671 --> 00:27:03,901
I'm on my way over so we can talk.

365
00:27:04,943 --> 00:27:06,015
Helen?

366
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:08,896
I'm busy with a patient...

367
00:27:08,896 --> 00:27:12,783
in the pathology lab.

368
00:27:12,783 --> 00:27:14,484
- Helen?
- That was him, wasn't it?

369
00:27:14,484 --> 00:27:16,602
It was him. Wasn't it?!

370
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:21,320
He doesn't love you!
Can't you see that?

371
00:27:21,613 --> 00:27:24,783
Helen, what's going on?

372
00:27:29,182 --> 00:27:31,484
Get up here.
Get up here, come on!

373
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,284
Helen?!

374
00:27:34,795 --> 00:27:38,992
Paul, no! No! Aah!

375
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:51,856
Helen!

376
00:27:52,522 --> 00:27:53,800
Helen!

377
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,993
Helen!

378
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,350
Helen!

379
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:16,847
Get her to ER!
I need to 2 cc EPI and an IV push. Stat!

380
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:19,592
Stat!

381
00:28:19,592 --> 00:28:22,769
Helen, Helen.

382
00:28:29,343 --> 00:28:31,847
Smallville is officially litter free.

383
00:28:31,847 --> 00:28:33,572
You must be exhausted.

384
00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:35,793
Well, frustrated and humiliated, yes.

385
00:28:35,793 --> 00:28:38,141
Exhausted, no.

386
00:28:38,141 --> 00:28:40,855
Hey, I can stick around
for a little while if you want.

387
00:28:40,855 --> 00:28:42,387
I'm fine, Clark.

388
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:46,140
I know. I just thought you
might want some company.

389
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,542
Karate class?

390
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:51,650
I take it the meeting
with Lex went well.

391
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:56,782
Lex has a way of bringing out a side of me that's
both scary and liberating at the same time.

392
00:28:56,782 --> 00:28:59,948
Well, you know the first rule of
self defense is to avoid conflict.

393
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:03,983
Relax, Clark, I'm not about to go
prowling the night fighting crime.

394
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:05,816
I'll leave that to the expert.

395
00:29:05,816 --> 00:29:12,382
Well, you can trust me, there's no future in
fighting crime unless you enjoy being sued.

396
00:29:13,373 --> 00:29:15,171
You know what the worst part is?

397
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:17,955
I know that he's faking.
I just don't have proof.

398
00:29:17,955 --> 00:29:21,323
I was gonna follow him with a camera,
but I'd be violating the restraining order.

399
00:29:21,323 --> 00:29:24,092
Well, what about me?

400
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:25,665
What about you?

401
00:29:25,665 --> 00:29:28,801
I want to see him go down as
badly as you do. Let me help.

402
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,990
No, that'd be too dangerous.

403
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:35,875
Clark, the law's not on our side.
What's are we supposed to do?

404
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:47,256
Meacham, where the hell are you?
I need to know where Hayden is now!

405
00:29:47,256 --> 00:29:49,263
Mr. Luthor?

406
00:29:49,263 --> 00:29:52,415
I am sorry about Dr. Bryce,

407
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:56,042
but I hope you are not planning
to take the law into your own hands.

408
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:59,387
The woman I love is fighting
for her life, Sheriff, so

409
00:29:59,387 --> 00:30:02,634
you'll have to forgive my lack
of faith in Smallville's finest.

410
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,514
I have roadblocks up
across every major highway.

411
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:07,735
I have deputies canvassing the area,

412
00:30:07,735 --> 00:30:10,131
and I am waiting for a warrant
on his motel room.

413
00:30:10,131 --> 00:30:11,418
How long will that take?

414
00:30:11,418 --> 00:30:15,631
It will take a little while, but I have rung
every judge's bell in Lowell County.

415
00:30:15,631 --> 00:30:18,908
Well, I'm certainly glad you're
doing everything humanly possible.

416
00:30:18,908 --> 00:30:21,342
Mr. Luthor, where are you going?

417
00:30:21,342 --> 00:30:23,482
If I find you have tampered
with this investigation--

418
00:30:23,482 --> 00:30:25,954
You'll what?!

419
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:28,230
You'll arrest me and make
me pick up trash?

420
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,123
You are not above the law, Mr. Luthor.

421
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:35,221
Thank you for that bracing insight.

422
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:38,254
Am I free to go now?

423
00:30:43,311 --> 00:30:46,009
Meacham!

424
00:30:52,687 --> 00:30:55,149
Lex?

425
00:30:57,704 --> 00:30:59,640
Sheriff, I heard about Dr. Bryce.
Is she okay?

426
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,943
It's still touch and go.

427
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:01,987
Was it Paul Hayden?

428
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:07,955
Mr. Kent, do I have to remind you about
involving yourself in police business?

429
00:31:07,955 --> 00:31:10,811
Where do we stand on that warrant
for Hayden's room at the Heartland?

430
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:13,762
Twenty minutes.
We have cars standing by.

431
00:31:48,804 --> 00:31:51,432
- Clark, how did you get-- 
- The same way you did.

432
00:31:51,432 --> 00:31:52,787
What are you doing here, Lex?

433
00:31:52,787 --> 00:31:54,701
Look, stay out of this.

434
00:31:54,701 --> 00:32:00,053
- I know you want to nail this guy.
- But what? I should leave it to the pros?

435
00:32:00,053 --> 00:32:02,155
Hayden's car is still here, okay?

436
00:32:02,155 --> 00:32:06,619
I had a guy on him.
Now he's no--

437
00:32:43,607 --> 00:32:47,362
Son of a bitch,
he's got Meacham's car.

438
00:32:47,912 --> 00:32:50,838
Lex, we got company.

439
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:19,425
Lojack system said the car was here.

440
00:33:19,425 --> 00:33:23,039
I thought only the police
had access to Lojack.

441
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,851
- Let's split up.
- No, I think we should wait for Sheriff Adams.

442
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:31,192
You wait. I'm gonna go look around.

443
00:34:11,154 --> 00:34:15,754
If you pull that trigger, you're going
to be the one going to prison.

444
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:27,078
Not if it's self defense.

445
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,068
I guess I forgot to load it.

446
00:34:40,068 --> 00:34:43,514
You're just full of surprises
today, aren't you?

447
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:23,226
Goodbye, Paul.

448
00:37:33,816 --> 00:37:35,511
Lex!

449
00:37:39,774 --> 00:37:42,372
Hands up!

450
00:37:42,835 --> 00:37:47,112
Get rid of that gun, and put
that gun on the table right now.

451
00:37:47,112 --> 00:37:50,442
Put it on the table now!

452
00:37:57,155 --> 00:38:03,352
Last time I checked, citizen's
arrests are still legal in Kansas.

453
00:38:05,012 --> 00:38:07,914
Oh, man.

454
00:38:07,914 --> 00:38:11,141
I'm telling you,

455
00:38:11,141 --> 00:38:17,557
if I catch you meddling in a police
investigation again, I swear...

456
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:21,346
heaven help you.

457
00:38:38,312 --> 00:38:40,151
Thanks for coming.

458
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:44,714
Well, this better be good to
get me out of bed so early.

459
00:38:44,714 --> 00:38:47,620
Listen, Andy, um,

460
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,053
I'm really sorry about what
happened the other night,

461
00:38:51,053 --> 00:38:55,371
but I think this has gotten a little
out of hand. The lawsuit?

462
00:38:55,371 --> 00:38:58,494
Don't worry about it.
It's Kent's problem.

463
00:38:58,494 --> 00:39:01,229
I know you're faking your injuries.

464
00:39:01,229 --> 00:39:05,912
I think you should drop
the suit before you get caught.

465
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:14,211
You didn't call me here to
talk about no lawsuit, did you.

466
00:39:14,211 --> 00:39:15,701
Touch me again,

467
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:19,369
and you'll have some
real soft-tissue injury.

468
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:21,611
You can play hard to get,

469
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:24,612
but we both know you want me.

470
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,133
So why don't we take
this into the back.

471
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,643
Hi, Clark.

472
00:39:56,643 --> 00:40:02,117
I just got a phone call saying
that Andy dropped the lawsuit.

473
00:40:02,117 --> 00:40:05,333
Any idea what could've
made him do that?

474
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:11,015
Maybe he just realized that
you were trying to help a friend.

475
00:40:12,487 --> 00:40:16,013
The sheriff told me
you have quite a spin kick.

476
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,293
I'm sorry I missed it.

477
00:40:18,798 --> 00:40:21,796
So you heard about that.

478
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:25,037
- Lana...
- Clark, I know what you're gonna say.

479
00:40:25,037 --> 00:40:27,185
I shouldn't have gotten involved, but--

480
00:40:27,185 --> 00:40:30,533
I just wanted to say thank you.

481
00:40:34,145 --> 00:40:41,453
Well, you've been there for me so
many times. I wanted to repay you.

482
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,439
Besides,

483
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:51,826
it's not every day that Lana Lang
gets a chance to save Clark Kent.

484
00:40:54,944 --> 00:40:57,036
Yeah.

485
00:41:10,253 --> 00:41:13,247
I thought you had a board meeting.

486
00:41:13,247 --> 00:41:16,965
I canceled it for personal reasons.

487
00:41:17,593 --> 00:41:20,352
That's a first.

488
00:41:26,877 --> 00:41:31,181
My lawyer told me that Paul
is pleading temporary insanity.

489
00:41:31,181 --> 00:41:35,240
- Lex, I don't want-- 
- I told him not to fight the plea.

490
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,769
Paul needs help.

491
00:41:44,674 --> 00:41:47,893
I wanted to kill him, Helen.

492
00:41:48,212 --> 00:41:52,025
I wanted to kill him for what he did to you.

493
00:41:52,025 --> 00:41:57,223
I probably could've gotten
away with it in everyone's eyes,

494
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,960
but one person would've known the truth.

495
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,922
Clark?

496
00:42:01,922 --> 00:42:05,015
You.

497
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,733
Clark didn't save me
in that moment, Helen.

498
00:42:09,733 --> 00:42:12,592
You did.

499
00:42:15,168 --> 00:42:18,787
And that's when I knew.

500
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:38,430
So what do you say, Dr. Bryce?

501
00:42:38,943 --> 00:42:42,256
Will you marry me?

502
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
