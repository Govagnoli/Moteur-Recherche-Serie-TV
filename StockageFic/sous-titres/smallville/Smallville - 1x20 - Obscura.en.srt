1
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,920
It's been a long time
since we've done this.

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,360
Thought it'd be nice, you know?
Something to keep your mind off of...

3
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,360
It's okay, you can say it,
I'm not gonna break.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,720
Sorry, I've just been kind of
out of it lately.

5
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,840
I'm here if you need to talk.

6
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,880
There's one thing I wanted to ask you.

7
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,080
Would you be my date
to the spring formal?

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,360
Of course. You didn't have to ask.

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,520
I guess I'm not taking anything
for granted anymore.

10
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,000
This is Watts and Vertigo, we have a gas
fire just off Route Twelve, mile marker 18.

11
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,440
Whitney, look!

12
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,520
- Hey!
- Hey!

13
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,800
- Lana, get out of here. Run!
- Whitney, don't! Don't!

14
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,640
Look at the pipe!

15
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,600
Everybody, clear on out!

16
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,320
Lana, get out of here! Go, run!

17
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,960
- Lana!
- Get down!

18
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,040
Lana? Lana!

19
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,680
Hey, I just heard, is she all right?

20
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,040
Yeah. They gave her something
to help her rest.

21
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
How you holding up?

22
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,560
Kind of hoped I'd seen my last
hospital room in a while.

23
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,480
Hey. Hey!

24
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,880
- I thought you'd be halfway to Metropolis.
- It's just an internship, I can reschedule.

25
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,320
You've been waiting for that interview
for weeks.

26
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,840
I know, I just feel weird
taking off right now.

27
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,680
Lana's gonna be okay.

28
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,640
It's just a mild concussion.

29
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,480
I'm crashing in my cousin's dorm. Call me
if anything goes wrong with the Torch.

30
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,760
We can survive one day without you.

31
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,920
You gonna wish me luck?

32
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,160
You don't need it.

33
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,080
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

34
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,920
Can I buy you a coffee?

35
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,800
Yeah.

36
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,480
Chloe!

37
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,600
Obscura

38
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,320
Okay, well, I'll let you know. Bye.

39
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,360
- Who was that, the plumber?
- No, your school.

40
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,200
Don't worry. You're not in trouble.

41
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,440
They're looking for chaperones
for the spring formal.

42
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,200
- Oh, what'd you say?
- I said you hadn't even mentioned it.

43
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,840
I don't think the whole tux-and-limo thing
is for me.

44
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,200
- Besides, it's customary to have a date.
- It's customary to ask someone.

45
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,240
Martha, stay out of it.

46
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,160
Son, can you get that trap
out of there for me?

47
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,320
Uh, sure, Dad.

48
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,040
Thank you.

49
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,560
So, are you planning
on asking Chloe or not?

50
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,000
She just can't help herself.

51
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,080
Don't use the sink until I
get back.

52
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,200
- I'm not sure.
- Well, you said you had feelings for her.

53
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,680
It's not about Chloe.

54
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,600
You can't keep putting your life
on hold because of Lana.

55
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,200
But if she sees me with someone else,
it's like I'm saying the door's closed.

56
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,840
The door is closed, Clark.

57
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,920
You need to admit that to yourself.

58
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,120
Hi, Lex, come on in.

59
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,080
Sorry to barge in. I came by
to see you and Mr. Kent.

60
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,400
Oh, I'll go get him.

61
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,880
- In a hurry?
- Yeah.

62
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,920
I'm taking over at the Torch while Chloe's
out of town. Catch up with you later.

63
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,600
- Hi, Lex.
- Hey.

64
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,320
What can I do for you?

65
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,600
The paperwork on the chemical spill
finally came through.

66
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,600
I never thought I'd see the day.

67
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,400
Since the dumping wasn't done
by an actual LuthorCorp employee...

68
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,040
...it did require jumping
through some corporate hoops.

69
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,000
The accident was unfortunate.
I know your...

70
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,560
...loss can't be fixed entirely
with money, but...

71
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,440
...I hope this helps.

72
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,480
Well, I...

73
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,120
...appreciate the gesture, but...

74
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,320
Hope we're not getting special treatment
because of your friendship with Clark.

75
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,000
I assure you, Mr. Kent, that
has nothing to do with this.

76
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,360
- This is very generous, Lex.
- Actually, it isn't.

77
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,680
It reflects the exact value
of the herd and grazing land you lost.

78
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,800
I wouldn't insult you
by putting you in my debt.

79
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,440
All I want is to leave the doubt
between us in the past.

80
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,280
Hey. How you feeling?

81
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,480
Better. Now it only hurts
when I walk, sit, or breathe.

82
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,240
Surprised to see you. Usually a hospital
visit comes with a "get out of jail" card.

83
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,680
Actually, I was looking for Chloe.

84
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,240
Not here. She's in Metropolis until tonight.

85
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,800
- You covering?
- Well, if you can call it that.

86
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The printer's jammed,
the scanner's broken...

87
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,720
...and the spring formal schedule is late.

88
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,880
Chloe leaves for a day and the Torch
goes down in flames.

89
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,240
Safe to say we won't lose you to the
entrancing world of journalism.

90
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,200
So have you talked to Chloe?

91
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,600
I left a message on her cell phone.

92
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,800
She's busy convincing the Planet they
were insane ever to publish without her.

93
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,080
What's up?

94
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,200
I had this intense dream about Chloe
I just can't shake.

95
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,280
It was totally surreal, but I dreamed she
was attacked outside of the hospital.

96
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,320
I know. It sounds crazy.

97
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,880
It's got you freaked.

98
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,600
It's just, it felt like I was right there.

99
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,600
She was walking to her car and getting her
keys from her red bag with the butterflies.

100
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,920
What is it?

101
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,120
She was carrying that red bag
when she left the hospital.

102
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,680
Do you want me to call her dad
to see if she's all right?

103
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,800
You know,
I'm sure it's just the concussion.

104
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,640
Don't want to scare him because
I was on painkillers.

105
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,440
Yeah, it was probably a nightmare.

106
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,120
I'll see you later.

107
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,320
Lex?

108
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,480
Since I didn't call you, and I haven't heard
of any three-headed sheep in Smallville...

109
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,280
...what brings the Inquisitor here?
- We need to talk.

110
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,320
I seriously doubt that.

111
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,040
Seems you've given out gifts
to the competition.

112
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,520
Now, we had an arrangement.

113
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,240
You give me stories,
I give you information.

114
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,840
Now, what did Carrie Castle do for you
that I couldn't?

115
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,480
She gave me
a pretty mean shiatsu massage.

116
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,520
Well, mock all you want, Lex.

117
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,000
It just means I've had to take
the initiative, develop my own leads.

118
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,640
There's a story here in Smallville,
and I am going to make my name on it.

119
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,520
I thought my position was clear.

120
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,360
I don't want you near the Kents. They're
off-limits, they're under my protection.

121
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,960
And what about the meteors?

122
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,880
- Are they under your protection?
- Do you have something?

123
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,560
I found a man who had a very
interesting view of the meteor shower.

124
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,360
Claims he saw something
fall out of the sky.

125
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,280
We all did.

126
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,880
Yeah, well, not like this.

127
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,400
If you're feeling so abused,
why are you bringing this to me?

128
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,440
Getting the full story takes money
and access, and unlike some...

129
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,400
...I always hold up my end of the deal.

130
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,480
Get ready to thank me.

131
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,400
Hey, hey, Clark.

132
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,280
Take it easy, would you?

133
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,720
- Thing's been in our family a long time.
- Stupid thing won't start!

134
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,440
Clark.

135
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,920
- What's going on, son?
- I'm worried.

136
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,480
I'm sure Chloe's going to call and you'll
realize you've been worried about nothing.

137
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,680
Yeah.

138
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,720
I'm glad we'll finally be rid of this.

139
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,320
We spend more time fixing it than riding it.

140
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,960
Well, I'm not sure that I'm quite
ready to retire the old girl yet.

141
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,600
Well, with Lex's check
we can get a new one.

142
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,760
Actually, I haven't decided
to deposit that check.

143
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Dad, Lex is trying to do the right thing.

144
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,120
I know he is, Clark. I know he didn't...

145
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,320
...try to buy me off.
He's just trying to repay for damages.

146
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,040
You're right, I've got no real...

147
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,240
...reason to doubt him, it's just,
something in my gut tells me I should.

148
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,480
Lex isn't perfect, Dad, I know that.

149
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,240
But slamming the door in his face
over and over...

150
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,200
...only helps turn him into exactly
what you think he already is.

151
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,000
When did you get to be so wise?

152
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,320
Ask my dad.

153
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,960
I'll sleep on it.

154
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,200
Hey, Clark.

155
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,000
- Talked to Chloe yet?
- No...

156
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,680
...but the Planet better not have
turned her down.

157
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,000
Just thought she would have
called by now.

158
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,160
She probably already got the internship
and is out partying with her cousin.

159
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,000
So, did I mention...

160
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,680
...I'm taking Erica Fox to the formal?
- Several times, yes.

161
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,840
The hottest girl in our class. Just
want to make sure that was clear.

162
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,040
- It is.
- So, want to know my secret? You do.

163
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,800
I asked her. You ought to try it. Getting up
off your butt. It's the wave of the future.

164
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,600
I've gotta go reserve my limo
for the spring formal.

165
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,360
To which, incidentally,
I'm taking Erica Fox!

166
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,280
I hadn't heard.

167
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,800
Any word on our intrepid reporter?

168
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,680
I called her dad.
He was stuck in a seminar.

169
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,760
- I'm sure she'll be okay.
- Yeah, me too.

170
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,520
You can buy tickets to the formal here.

171
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,800
- That's a cool idea.
- You ask anyone yet?

172
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,880
I've got my eye on someone.

173
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,320
Well, you'd better hurry up. No one
likes to look for a dress last minute.

174
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,040
Not even Chloe.

175
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,600
What makes you think I'm asking Chloe?

176
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,240
Lana.

177
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,880
- It happened again.
- You saw something.

178
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,000
I saw Chloe. Somebody's got her.
You have to believe me, Clark.

179
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,360
Come on, Chloe, come on.

180
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,560
You've been through worse than this.
Come on, Chloe.

181
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,360
Okay, maybe you're lying.

182
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,360
Home sweet home.

183
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,480
Hey, guys. I called the sheriff's office
because I wanted them to hear this too.

184
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,480
Any luck reaching Chloe, Mr. Sullivan?

185
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,440
No, I haven't heard from her.
I'm starting to get concerned.

186
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,920
I called her cousin, but I get the machine.

187
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,000
You said you had proof Chloe
might've been abducted?

188
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,680
Well, I sort of had a vision.

189
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,560
A vision.

190
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,280
She saw Chloe being kidnapped.

191
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,640
Maybe you should have called the Psychic
Friends Network instead then.

192
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,800
What makes you think it was real?

193
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,440
I saw Chloe bound and blindfolded
in a dark room.

194
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,280
Well, too bad you didn't see something
a little more useful, like an address...

195
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,080
...where we might find her.

196
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,320
- Excuse me.
- Ms. Lang...

197
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,720
...you went through a rough
ordeal yesterday.

198
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,400
Are you sure you're feeling okay?

199
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,840
You mean, do I think I'm hallucinating?

200
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,320
I felt like I was there, like I was seeing
through the kidnapper's eyes.

201
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,680
- We'll take this seriously, and look into it.
- Thanks.

202
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,520
Mr. Sullivan? What is it?

203
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,520
They found Chloe's car.

204
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,240
It's been abandoned in the woods.

205
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,760
So far, I'm unimpressed.

206
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,200
Reserve judgment for five minutes.

207
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,360
- Starting now.
- Mr. Cole, this is...

208
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,520
Lex Luthor. I know who he is.

209
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,160
He's very interested in your story.

210
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,360
12 years ago, Eddie had more clients
than he could handle.

211
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,360
Spent eight hours a day dusting fields
all over Smallville.

212
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,920
And then?

213
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,040
FAA pulled my license.

214
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,240
And why would they do that?

215
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,640
Decided I wasn't fit in the head
to fly anymore.

216
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,040
Because I couldn't keep my dumb
mouth shut.

217
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,640
What were your rates for crop dusting,
Mr. Cole?

218
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,960
600 a day.

219
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,000
I'd very much like to hear your story.

220
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,600
I was up in my prop,
dusting the Bakers' field.

221
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,520
Fifty acres of sweet corn.
When it happened.

222
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,600
The meteors?

223
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,800
It was like lightning, all around.
Pretty sure I was going to die right there.

224
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,920
Then one...

225
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,360
...just missed my tail by about 10 feet.

226
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,880
I saw it go straight down, and then
swerve just before it hit.

227
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,240
Doesn't sound like a meteor.

228
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,160
I know aircraft better than most.

229
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,880
The way that thing moved,
it had to be a ship.

230
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,880
You saw a ship crash?

231
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,920
Well, it's not just that I saw a ship crash.

232
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,720
Couple hours later, went to look for it.
It was gone.

233
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,320
Maybe it burned.

234
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,200
Or maybe it was taken.

235
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,040
Nobody believes me.

236
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,320
Gave Mr. Nixon a map of the crash site.

237
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,400
I've seen it.

238
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,280
So you believe me?

239
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,840
It's a good story.

240
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,120
Thanks for your time, Mr. Cole.

241
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,280
Hey!

242
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,680
Thought you'd be pleased. I brought
the story you've been waiting for.

243
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,360
You brought me a desperate man
and a tall tale.

244
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,360
It's about what I expected from you.

245
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,400
Sorry, Rog, time's up.

246
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,880
Any word on Chloe?

247
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,560
My dad and I went out with
Mr. Sullivan and the police.

248
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,080
We searched the woods but
we didn't find anything.

249
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,800
They've organized a search party,
tomorrow morning.

250
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,680
How you doing?

251
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,880
Spent the afternoon at the sheriff's station
telling them what I saw.

252
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,640
Kept looking at me like I was crazy.

253
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,160
I don't think you're crazy.

254
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,800
How are you holding up?

255
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,760
I keep wishing Chloe would just
walk up those steps.

256
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,640
I never appreciated how much
she meant to me until now.

257
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,800
- The thought of never seeing her again...
- Clark.

258
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,080
You can't think that way.

259
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,760
You know, I remember the first time
I met her.

260
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,560
It was eighth grade.

261
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,400
She'd just transferred from Metropolis
and I was assigned to show her around.

262
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,040
She wanted to know where
she could buy a copy of the Planet...

263
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,680
...so she could keep in touch
with civilization.

264
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,840
When she found out I lived on a farm, she
insisted I invite her over to experience it.

265
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,040
I think she thought I was Amish.

266
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,240
When I brought her up here...

267
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,800
...she just kissed me, right out of the blue.

268
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,720
Why'd she do that?

269
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,320
She said, "I know you've been thinking
about that...

270
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,160
...so I figured we'd get it out of the way
and be friends."

271
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,600
It was my first kiss.

272
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,720
It's nice it was with someone
you still care about.

273
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,960
We're going to see her again, Clark.

274
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,840
Lana?

275
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,040
- I just saw her again.
- Chloe? Where?

276
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,320
- Buried. She's still alive.
- Did you see where she was?

277
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,800
I'm not sure, but there was
a windmill. A big one.

278
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,400
She must be out in Chandler's Field.
I'll get help!

279
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,760
Chloe? Chloe!

280
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,000
- Chloe, it's okay! It's okay.
- Clark!

281
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,760
Clark.

282
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,720
I knew it was you, it's always you.

283
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,280
Thanks, I appreciate that.

284
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,440
I gotta go. Some real people
just came in.

285
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,640
- Who was that?
- The Daily Planet.

286
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,520
Thought you missed your appointment
for the internship.

287
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,960
I did. They were calling
about an interview.

288
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,120
Are you gonna do it?

289
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,120
No. I've wanted my name in the
Daily Planet, but not like this.

290
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,680
Besides, I figured the Torch could
use an exclusive, which...

291
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,080
...I will write as soon as I get out of here.

292
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,480
Chloe, do you remember anything?

293
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,360
I remember...

294
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,840
...tripping on some metal rails...

295
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,280
...and I remember...

296
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,480
...hundreds of teddy bears
hanging from the ceiling.

297
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,320
Anyway, that's where I was kept until l...

298
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,200
I'm sorry, you guys. Flashback. I can
still hear the dirt falling on the coffin.

299
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,120
Sorry.

300
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,000
If you hadn't found me,
I don't know where I'd be.

301
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,000
Don't thank me, thank Lana.

302
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,800
Yeah, I gotta hand it to you...

303
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,160
...you sure picked a perfect time to take
a walk on the weird side.

304
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,200
You should get some rest.

305
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,160
Clark.

306
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Would you mind sticking around
for a while?

307
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Whoever did this is still out there.

308
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,400
Of course not. I'll stay here
as long as you need.

309
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,360
Thanks.

310
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,560
Okay, well, I guess I'll
see you guys tomorrow.

311
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,080
Bye, Lana.

312
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,040
- Okay.
- Bye.

313
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,240
Glad you could join me.

314
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,280
- How late were you at the hospital?
- All night.

315
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,920
I snuck in after visiting hours.

316
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,600
I'm sure Chloe appreciated that.

317
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,200
I'm worried that the person
who did this is out there.

318
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,440
Clark, you got her back safe and sound.
That's what's important.

319
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,160
Without Lana I wouldn't have.

320
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,120
Hey, she hasn't had any more
visions, has she?

321
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,760
No. I think they're connected to the gas
pipe explosion. That's when they started.

322
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,920
- I'm gonna check that out.
- No, son, let the police do it. It's their job.

323
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,800
- Wish I knew who she was seeing through.
- What you need to focus on right now...

324
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,640
...is getting this truckload of feed
over to the Millers.

325
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,120
So you've had a night to sleep on it, what
are you going to do with Lex's check?

326
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,480
I might be stubborn, but I'm not blind.

327
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,680
Yeah, I had a talk with your mom.

328
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,720
As soon as we deliver the feed...

329
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,600
...I'm taking it to the savings and loan.

330
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,200
- Keep them moving.
- All right.

331
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,240
What's up, Lex?

332
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,040
Considering buying this land for a project,
but I wanted to test the soil first.

333
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,520
Standard operating procedure.

334
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,400
Since when does that procedure include
metal detectors and HAZMAT suits?

335
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,720
To be honest, there may have been
a major meteor strike on the site.

336
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,720
There's no proof the meteors
were harmful, but...

337
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,960
It never hurts to dot your I's
and cross your T's, right?

338
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,960
LuthorCorp's environmental record has
taken some serious hits in recent weeks.

339
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,960
Better safe than sorry.
Is there a problem?

340
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,400
Dad?

341
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,960
The problem is, Lex, that...

342
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,400
...what's good for LuthorCorp isn't always
what's good for this town.

343
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,960
Mr. Luthor.

344
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,840
Looks like you've got business
to attend to.

345
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,120
I've decided I can't accept your money.

346
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,080
Mr. Kent, I don't understand.

347
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,720
I wouldn't expect you would.

348
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,200
- Lex, l...
- It's okay, Clark.

349
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,920
I'll talk to you later.

350
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,680
Dad.

351
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,160
Dad!

352
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,600
Lex didn't deserve that.
People test the land all the time.

353
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,320
I know that, Clark.

354
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,200
But this field is where your ship
crashed down.

355
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,080
If Lex's scientists find anything out here,
they could trace it back to you.

356
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,280
Keep swinging the detector through
until we get a reading.

357
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,960
Come on.

358
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,640
Lex, you gotta see this.

359
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,960
You understand what this could mean.

360
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,840
More than you know.

361
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,360
I want you to handle all the tests
personally, then report directly to me.

362
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,320
- How you feeling?
- Better.

363
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,680
At least the nightmares
seem to have stopped.

364
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,120
I'm glad you came by.

365
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,000
Went home early. Started going through
some of my dad's things.

366
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,360
- Sure you're ready for that?
- It's okay.

367
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,640
It actually brought back
some nice memories.

368
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,680
And I found this.

369
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,400
These were your father's?

370
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,520
Yeah.

371
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,520
I knew he served in Vietnam,
but he never talked about it.

372
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,920
Know what they're for?

373
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,560
Yeah. They keep a registry on the Internet.

374
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,880
Silver star's for exceptional valour.

375
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,880
He rescued three men in his unit
during a firefight.

376
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,920
He was wounded, but he
wouldn't leave his men behind.

377
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,720
Sounds like your dad.

378
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,440
Wonder why he never told you.

379
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,680
Maybe he just did.

380
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,320
You know...

381
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,840
...you win a couple football games
and people start calling you a hero.

382
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,320
It feels good, but...

383
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,800
...maybe he's trying to tell me throwing a
ball isn't the only thing important in life.

384
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,920
Glad to see I'm not the only one
who's curious in Smallville.

385
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,840
Hey, Lex. What are you doing here?

386
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,400
I feel like I owe your father an apology,
but I'm not exactly sure why.

387
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,360
It's not you. It's everything.

388
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,560
Money problems, the farm.

389
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,440
He didn't understand what you
were doing in that field.

390
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,160
I thought I made myself clear.

391
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,600
You did.

392
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,760
You don't believe me either.

393
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,680
I know you get obsessed about things,
like the car accident.

394
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,840
I find it hard to believe you'd waste time
supervising a land survey...

395
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,600
...if that's what it was.

396
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,680
My life changed when the meteors hit,
I need to know why.

397
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,080
You can't let it go?

398
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,440
This isn't some empty emotional quest.
It's about finding the truth.

399
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,120
The truth.

400
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,920
I found a man.

401
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,480
He said something besides the meteors
came down that day.

402
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,320
Like what?

403
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,640
A ship.

404
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,800
And you believe him.

405
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,760
I listened.

406
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,160
Chances are he's another crackpot,
but I'd be remiss if I didn't check it out.

407
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,840
And when the next story crops up,
you'll check that one too.

408
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,000
When are you going to put
your past behind you?

409
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,000
You look at the stars, Clark.

410
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,520
Some of them have been extinguished
for thousands of years...

411
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,600
...but their light is only reaching us now.

412
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,320
Past is always influencing the present.

413
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,680
I can't change that.

414
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,520
All I can do is try to understand it.

415
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,040
Chloe, why aren't you at home sleeping?

416
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,880
If I fall asleep, I'll have nightmares,
so I figure the best thing is keep busy.

417
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,200
God knows you left a mess
for me to clean up.

418
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,400
Well, I'm glad you're here.

419
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,560
Hey, Whitney.
You sure you're in the right place?

420
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,440
Clark called, said he needed my help.

421
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,280
I figured out how Lana got her visions.
The explosion.

422
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,280
You think the blast caused them?

423
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,200
More than that. It connected her
with someone.

424
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,080
Clark Kent leaps tall theories in a single
bound. How did you arrive at this one?

425
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,960
Apparently there were meteor rocks
at the explosion...

426
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,320
...and I found this article.

427
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,280
The De Kretser Syndrome?

428
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,800
It's like a post-traumatic
stress disorder.

429
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,280
There were cases reported
during the London blitz.

430
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,920
People in shelters would find themselves
psychically linked after a bomb hit nearby.

431
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,400
I'm sold.

432
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:02,600
According to this, it's in times of stress,
anger, or excitement that triggers visions.

433
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,000
Who was around Lana after the explosion?

434
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,760
Myself and two deputies.
Watts and Vertigo.

435
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,760
They were with your dad when
we told them about Lana's vision.

436
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,360
He probably called them himself.
They're in a bowling league together.

437
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,600
Whitney, which one got to her first?

438
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,200
It's tough to say, it all happened so fast.

439
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,160
One of these cops kidnapped Chloe?

440
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,000
Who would suspect a cop?
We have to warn Lana.

441
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,160
If one is the kidnapper, he knows Lana's
seeing through his eyes.

442
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,120
- Great, I'll drive.
- That's okay. We'll take my car.

443
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,160
Miss Lang.

444
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,360
I know it's late, but I just wanted to
ask you a few more questions.

445
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,160
Surprised you found the time.

446
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,480
I know I deserve that.

447
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,080
Do you want a cup of coffee?

448
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,160
Sure.

449
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,840
Okay.

450
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,640
- Where is Lana?
- I don't know, she was here.

451
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,920
The guy must have grabbed her.

452
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,480
I'm gonna check the back.

453
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,080
- Deputy, where's your partner tonight?
- Gary?

454
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,320
He's working a second job at the carnival.
He's a security guard.

455
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,400
You saw stuffed animals and train tracks.

456
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,760
The carnival's closed this time of year.
It's perfect to hide someone.

457
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,840
Hello?

458
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,800
Hello?

459
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,720
Help!

460
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,440
Somebody please help me!

461
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,800
No one can hear you.

462
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,640
- How did you see through my eyes?
- I don't know.

463
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,720
Deputy Watts.

464
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,080
Why are you doing this?

465
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:49,680
I never wanted to hurt Chloe. I didn't even
want money. I wanted to rescue her.

466
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,720
You kidnapped Chloe so you could
take credit for finding her?

467
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,160
I could have been good!

468
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,680
The best cop this town's ever seen!

469
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,680
This case would've made my career!

470
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,520
But it doesn't matter now.
I can still be the hero.

471
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,000
What are you going to do?

472
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,520
Solve your murder.

473
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,120
No, please, please don't do this.

474
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,120
Lana.

475
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,760
- Lana, you all right?
- Clark, it's Watts, Deputy Watts.

476
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,160
Okay, stay here.

477
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,600
It's over, Watts.

478
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,880
What the hell are you?

479
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,480
Lana!

480
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,320
Gary, drop the gun!

481
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,520
Your mom told me you'd be out here.

482
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,560
I haven't seen that smile in a week.
What's up?

483
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,120
Well, I've got good news.

484
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,720
The Daily Planet called,
and I got an internship.

485
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,640
- That's great!
- Yeah!

486
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,840
- You didn't even interview.
- I know. Well...

487
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,200
...they read my article in the Ledger on the
cop, and I guess my work spoke for itself.

488
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,560
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

489
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,040
So I guess you'll spend the summer
in Metropolis.

490
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,560
Yeah.

491
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,240
- Will you come visit me?
- Yeah, of course!

492
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,160
I would never pass up an opportunity
to see you in your natural habitat.

493
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,640
Well, I just wanted you to be the first
to know, so I'll see you. Bye.

494
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,400
Chloe.

495
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,240
I was... Do you have plans
for the spring formal?

496
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,240
Not at the moment.

497
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,920
I was hoping...

498
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,400
I was hoping you'd go with me.

499
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,960
As my date.

500
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,160
I would love to, Clark.

501
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,920
Now I'm gonna go before my
good karma runs out.

502
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,920
Chloe...

503
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,760
...I'm sorry I didn't ask you sooner.

504
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,120
It's okay. It was worth the wait.

505
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,120
Lex, where's that crop-duster of yours?
I wanted to talk to him.

506
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,280
- He seems to have disappeared.
- Maybe your visit scared him.

507
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,720
Something or someone did.

508
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,120
- What do you have for me?
- Preliminary results...

509
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,680
...of the fragment we recovered.

510
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,440
So, what is it?

511
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,760
Well, all I can tell you...

512
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,800
...is what it is not.

513
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,560
I don't like riddles, doctor.

514
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,680
Then this object will make you
profoundly unhappy.

515
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,000
To be honest, Lex...

516
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,080
...there is nothing...

517
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
...like this alloy...

518
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,680
...on this Earth.
