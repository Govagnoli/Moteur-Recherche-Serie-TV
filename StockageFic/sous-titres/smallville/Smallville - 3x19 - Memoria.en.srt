1
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,767
Where is he?

2
00:00:12,935 --> 00:00:14,562
Out there.

3
00:00:14,804 --> 00:00:16,897
If anyone approaches,
he becomes hysterical.

4
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:19,701
He claims he's protecting
his brother, Julian.

5
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:22,803
Thank you. I'll handle this,
Mr. Woodruff.

6
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:25,777
-Mr. Luthor--
-He's my son.

7
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:54,640
Lex?

8
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:03,445
Lex.

9
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:06,952
If this is an attempt to get
yourself expelled, it's not gonna work.

10
00:01:09,392 --> 00:01:11,758
You'll wake the baby.

11
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:14,456
Lex, Julian's gone.

12
00:01:15,898 --> 00:01:17,923
He's right here.

13
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,263
I found him inside of my dorm, crying.

14
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:24,465
I told him I'd never let
anyone hurt him again.

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,667
Julian is dead, Lex. We both know why.

16
00:01:28,844 --> 00:01:32,302
You have to come
to terms with that. Now!

17
00:01:32,481 --> 00:01:36,383
-No, leave us alone!
-No, Lex! What are you doing?

18
00:01:36,552 --> 00:01:37,985
Just go home!

19
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:41,555
-Lex, come down off that ledge.
-Stay away from us!

20
00:01:41,724 --> 00:01:44,852
Stop this, Lex. Get down. Now!

21
00:01:45,027 --> 00:01:47,860
-Julian needs me!
-Lex! No!

22
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:52,998
Julian!

23
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:54,830
Julian!

24
00:01:56,339 --> 00:01:57,966
Lex!

25
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,904
-Stop it, Lex!
-Julian!

26
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:04,546
Julian! Julian!

27
00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:10,151
Lex!

28
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:18,919
Lex, what were you doing?

29
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:23,591
Where am l?

30
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:25,790
Hope I'm not interrupting.

31
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:28,862
Chloe told me
you were farm-bound all week.

32
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:32,665
Yeah, my dad's cardiologist sent him
to Metropolis for some more tests...

33
00:03:32,835 --> 00:03:35,827
-...so I'm pulling double duty.
-I thought he was getting better.

34
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:38,940
He is, but when your heart's been
through something like that...

35
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:41,736
...the scars just don't
magically disappear.

36
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:43,942
No.

37
00:03:44,113 --> 00:03:45,944
No, I guess they don't.

38
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,619
But I'm sure you didn't come all this way
just to admire my stall-mucking abilities.

39
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:57,392
I think there's something wrong with Lex.

40
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,529
I was dropping off the Talon payroll...

41
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:05,633
...and I found him out on the ledge,
screaming for someone named Julian.

42
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:11,771
What is it, Clark?

43
00:04:16,078 --> 00:04:19,377
Julian was the name
of Lex's baby brother.

44
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:22,073
He died of SlDS when Lex was a kid.

45
00:04:22,985 --> 00:04:25,044
Did he give you any kind of explanation?

46
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:27,045
No.

47
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,121
He shrugged it off as a bad dream.

48
00:04:31,794 --> 00:04:34,319
Last time Lex had a breakdown...

49
00:04:34,497 --> 00:04:39,127
...I found him over there, singing a lullaby
to a blanket he thought was Julian.

50
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,397
Well, maybe he's had a relapse.

51
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:46,874
Whatever it is,
you better stay clear for a while.

52
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,737
Clark, he's my friend.

53
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:52,542
The last time Lex went off the deep end,
you got trampled by a horse.

54
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:55,206
-Lex didn't mean to hurt me.
-But he did.

55
00:04:55,384 --> 00:04:58,945
And I promised myself
I wouldn't let that happen again.

56
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:03,850
I'll talk to him.

57
00:05:08,497 --> 00:05:12,831
Well, tell him I'm on my way and he needs
to clear his schedule for the afternoon.

58
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:21,270
Lana told you about my
nocturnal adventure, didn't she?

59
00:05:21,544 --> 00:05:25,446
I could see I spooked her,
and that usually sends her running to you.

60
00:05:26,148 --> 00:05:27,911
Are you okay?

61
00:05:28,217 --> 00:05:31,209
Well, I haven't lost my mind, Clark,
if that's what you mean.

62
00:05:32,488 --> 00:05:35,855
I just indulged in a little
harmless sleepwalking, that's all.

63
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:39,919
Lex, you were on a ledge,
yelling Julian's name.

64
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:42,063
You could've killed yourself.

65
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:47,532
You know, when I found you asleep
in the middle of Route 8 last year...

66
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:50,570
...I don't remember questioning
your mental health.

67
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:59,210
I hadn't just spent seven weeks
at Belle Reve.

68
00:06:02,851 --> 00:06:05,285
According to my doctors, I'm cured.

69
00:06:05,454 --> 00:06:09,288
But apparently a clean bill of health
isn't good enough for Clark Kent.

70
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:15,192
I can take care of myself.

71
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:48,058
These nightmares
are becoming more frequent.

72
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,993
They're not nightmares, Lex.

73
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:52,963
They're spontaneous memories.

74
00:06:53,135 --> 00:06:54,762
Look, Dr. Garner...

75
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:58,896
...whatever you call them,
they're starting to impact my waking life.

76
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:04,168
The electroshock therapy
atrophied this part of your brain.

77
00:07:04,346 --> 00:07:07,577
These memories are the equivalent
of a muscle spasm.

78
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,843
They indicate that
the treatment's working.

79
00:07:10,152 --> 00:07:11,744
Doctor.

80
00:07:11,987 --> 00:07:15,684
I didn't come to you to relive
repressed childhood traumas.

81
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:18,986
If you're concerned,
we can stop at any time.

82
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:26,230
The choice is yours.

83
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:42,777
Run scan.

84
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:52,554
Sequencing.

85
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:55,253
Just relax, Lex.

86
00:07:55,964 --> 00:07:59,900
Close your eyes and open
the door to your mind.

87
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:03,099
Think about your father.

88
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:05,872
Take us back to where we left off.

89
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:16,340
Where are you now?

90
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:19,883
My 1 2th birthday party.

91
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:24,648
Lex?

92
00:08:35,938 --> 00:08:39,203
I'm sorry, son, that your...

93
00:08:39,374 --> 00:08:44,107
...friends didn't get to see the beautiful
party that your mother planned for you.

94
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,112
I told you nobody would come.

95
00:08:47,716 --> 00:08:49,616
Everybody hates me.

96
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:51,484
That's not true.

97
00:08:58,894 --> 00:09:00,418
Lex.

98
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:03,023
Lex.

99
00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:08,535
They're jealous, Lex.

100
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:11,172
You're a Luthor, and you're....

101
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:13,274
You're--

102
00:09:15,043 --> 00:09:20,572
You're special, and it's always gonna
be difficult for others to accept that.

103
00:09:24,887 --> 00:09:26,548
I....

104
00:09:31,593 --> 00:09:33,424
Lex, here.

105
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:39,261
Your mother wanted to give you this
in person, but she's resting, so....

106
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:41,097
Is she okay?

107
00:09:44,072 --> 00:09:46,165
She seemed so sad.

108
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,767
No. No, she's....

109
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:52,141
She's just tired, that's all.

110
00:09:52,314 --> 00:09:55,181
This pregnancy's been very difficult
for her...

111
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,219
...but once the baby comes,
I know she'll be as excited as we are.

112
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:01,879
Here.

113
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:12,366
It's just an old box.

114
00:10:13,602 --> 00:10:15,399
No, no. It's much more than that.

115
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:20,668
This box was forged
from the armor of St. George.

116
00:10:20,843 --> 00:10:22,834
-The dragon slayer?
-That's right.

117
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:25,309
According to the legend, St. George...

118
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,109
...was fighting a particularly
fierce dragon.

119
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:32,879
The battle between them
had raged on for days...

120
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:36,149
...and St. George
was losing his strength...

121
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,887
...and his faith.

122
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,320
So he took a piece of broken armor...

123
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:44,431
...and he made it into this box.

124
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,731
Inside it, he put all his doubts
and his fears...

125
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:54,039
...and then he went out to face
the dragon again.

126
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:56,336
-Without any armor?
-Yeah.

127
00:10:56,511 --> 00:11:01,005
But when the dragon saw St. George
coming to do battle with him again...

128
00:11:01,183 --> 00:11:03,515
...it hesitated and drew back.

129
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:09,214
And in that moment, St. George plunged
his sword into the dragon's heart...

130
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,420
...and it fell dead.

131
00:11:14,062 --> 00:11:16,496
So when people are cruel to you...

132
00:11:16,665 --> 00:11:19,225
...you take all your fears
and your doubts...

133
00:11:19,401 --> 00:11:23,064
...you put them in here,
in this box...

134
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:25,570
...and then you lock it.

135
00:11:26,742 --> 00:11:29,973
Then you'll find that you're....

136
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:33,039
You're stronger than you think you are.

137
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:52,261
Bring him up.

138
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:54,095
That was a good session, Lex.

139
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:55,998
We're making progress.

140
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:29,199
What are you doing with Dr. Garner, Lex?

141
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:31,371
I thought I told you to stay out of this.

142
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,532
Lex, you know what he did to Molly.
And to Ryan.

143
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:37,775
-Lex, he's dangerous.
-I don't have to explain myself to you.

144
00:12:37,946 --> 00:12:39,277
Yes, you do, Lex.

145
00:12:39,448 --> 00:12:42,008
I can't understand why my
best friend keeps lying to me.

146
00:12:42,184 --> 00:12:44,209
What if you lost seven weeks of your life?

147
00:12:46,855 --> 00:12:48,948
That's what this is about.

148
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:52,918
Clark, if I could retrieve those memories,
they would give me the answers...

149
00:12:53,095 --> 00:12:55,256
...to the questions
that have been plaguing me.

150
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,694
But Dr. Garner knows no boundaries, Lex.

151
00:12:57,866 --> 00:13:00,494
If you get caught up in his research,
it could kill you.

152
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:02,500
I don't care.

153
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:05,070
I'm gonna remember everything.

154
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:34,001
When I got your call, I was shocked.

155
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:37,764
I couldn't imagine why you would
want to see me.

156
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:43,739
Lex is using a highly experimental
procedure at Summerholt lnstitute.

157
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,047
He's trying to retrieve
the memories he forgot.

158
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:55,180
Mr. Luthor, you're the only one powerful
enough to shut Summerholt down.

159
00:13:55,357 --> 00:14:00,795
Well, I'm flattered by your rather
naive view of my business prowess...

160
00:14:01,096 --> 00:14:04,793
...but why do you think I would resort
to behaving like a thug?

161
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:10,066
Because I don't think you really want
Lex to remember what he forgot.

162
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:15,405
No one cares more about Lex's
mental health than I do, Clark...

163
00:14:15,577 --> 00:14:19,911
...but it's not my prerogative to stop him
from regaining those lost memories.

164
00:14:24,086 --> 00:14:27,351
Even if he uncovers the truth
about his grandparents' death?

165
00:14:30,225 --> 00:14:31,624
You know, Clark...

166
00:14:31,793 --> 00:14:36,093
...I always thought that your parents'
corn-fed hokum had made you weak...

167
00:14:36,264 --> 00:14:40,633
...but clearly, I have underestimated
your dark side.

168
00:14:41,503 --> 00:14:43,664
I'm trying to save my friend.

169
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,473
No, you're not.

170
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:51,442
You came here trying to strong-arm me
under the guise of concern for Lex.

171
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:54,605
But it's you who doesn't want
him to regain his memory.

172
00:14:54,783 --> 00:14:56,717
That's not true.

173
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,015
I know your secret, Clark.

174
00:15:04,793 --> 00:15:07,785
I know your secret, Clark.

175
00:15:14,102 --> 00:15:17,833
You want Lex to stop this highly
dangerous therapy?

176
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:24,102
I suggest you start telling the truth.

177
00:15:33,455 --> 00:15:35,218
What brings you to Smallville, Dad?

178
00:15:36,091 --> 00:15:38,889
Find more evidence of little green men
in the Kawatche Caves?

179
00:15:40,128 --> 00:15:44,360
Another one of your extracurricular
activities has been brought to my attention.

180
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:49,894
Your excursions
to the Summerholt lnstitute.

181
00:15:51,173 --> 00:15:53,835
-Where did you hear that?
-Your good friend Clark.

182
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,716
SummerhoIt's
a highly respected institution.

183
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:03,145
Respected?

184
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:08,984
Lex, this Garner character operates
on the outer fringes of accepted science.

185
00:16:09,157 --> 00:16:11,557
Well, then you should feel right at home.

186
00:16:15,263 --> 00:16:16,662
Lex...

187
00:16:16,831 --> 00:16:19,561
...your mind is still very fragile.

188
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:25,200
Why would you risk jeopardizing your sanity
for the sake of a few lost memories?

189
00:16:26,474 --> 00:16:29,034
What's wrong, Dad?

190
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:30,838
You....

191
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:33,503
You're afraid of what
I'm gonna remember?

192
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:36,879
Because so far,
it's been very illuminating.

193
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,412
Lex.

194
00:16:40,989 --> 00:16:43,753
It's foolish for you to go on
with this treatment.

195
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:47,588
-lt could trigger another psychotic break.
-Look, that's--

196
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:15,988
Would you get something
to clean that up, please, Mary?

197
00:17:16,157 --> 00:17:18,352
Yes, Mr. Luthor.

198
00:17:18,526 --> 00:17:19,925
No, let me have Julian.

199
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:25,859
Yes. Yes.

200
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:28,332
Oh, look at his eyes.

201
00:17:30,138 --> 00:17:34,006
How he looks at you.
Oh, my. Look at that.

202
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:35,802
Lillian, he's like a prince.

203
00:17:35,977 --> 00:17:38,275
I don't want to hold him.

204
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:45,044
Lillian, it's unnatural for a mother not
to want to bond with her child. Please.

205
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:51,618
I will not let you inflict psychological scars
on my children.

206
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:54,819
That's why they have you, Lionel.

207
00:17:56,798 --> 00:17:58,993
No, you don't mean that, Lillian.

208
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:01,634
I told you I didn't want
any more children.

209
00:18:01,803 --> 00:18:04,601
I see how you treat Alexander...

210
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:06,536
...chipping away at his spirit.

211
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:08,969
Because you have made him weak.

212
00:18:09,277 --> 00:18:11,745
-You'll pit these boys against each other.
-No.

213
00:18:11,913 --> 00:18:14,473
Make them fight for your affection.

214
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:17,345
I won't let you turn them into monsters.

215
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,248
I want a divorce, Lionel.

216
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:24,920
Lillian, these threats, these constant
threats of yours are tiresome.

217
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:27,618
I allowed Lex to come home
for your sake.

218
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:31,163
Now, you're going to start to try.

219
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,927
Lillian, try.

220
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:37,771
Try. That's it.

221
00:18:40,575 --> 00:18:44,011
The four of us are going to be a family.

222
00:18:45,747 --> 00:18:48,511
All right, I'm going to give Mary
the night off.

223
00:18:48,683 --> 00:18:53,347
I think you need some time alone
with your son.

224
00:19:09,337 --> 00:19:10,929
Lex?

225
00:19:14,576 --> 00:19:16,168
Lex? What--?

226
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:19,579
Lex.

227
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,115
Lex, what are you doing?

228
00:19:30,392 --> 00:19:35,694
-Dad, it was an accident.
-Lex, what are you talking about?

229
00:19:52,313 --> 00:19:54,008
Hello, son.

230
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:57,216
What are you two boys up to, huh?

231
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,751
Lex?

232
00:20:09,898 --> 00:20:12,128
He wouldn't stop crying.

233
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,828
I tried to rock him, and then....

234
00:20:20,775 --> 00:20:22,936
You have to believe me.

235
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:26,503
What have you done, Lex?

236
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:32,217
What...?

237
00:20:38,793 --> 00:20:40,727
What have you done?

238
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:02,839
What have you done?

239
00:21:04,586 --> 00:21:07,054
What have you done?!

240
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,926
Lex. Son?

241
00:21:13,094 --> 00:21:15,460
-What happened?
-I don't know. We were talking...

242
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,190
...you went into a catatonic state and--

243
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:21,858
-I'll call a doctor, all right?
-Don't bother. I'm fine. I'm fine.

244
00:21:31,012 --> 00:21:34,106
This is a side effect of your treatment,
isn't it?

245
00:21:37,285 --> 00:21:39,947
-You're playing with fire, son.
-Stop it!

246
00:21:42,824 --> 00:21:46,521
You only care about preventing me
from getting back those seven weeks.

247
00:21:46,694 --> 00:21:49,162
I've got nothing to hide from you, Lex.

248
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:53,790
You spend too much time living
in the past. Start looking to the future.

249
00:21:53,968 --> 00:21:54,957
Get out.

250
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:58,100
-That's always been your weakness.
-Get out!

251
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,211
I love you too, sweetheart.

252
00:22:14,389 --> 00:22:16,152
Okay, bye.

253
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:19,851
I just spoke to your dad. He's well,
but they want him to stay an extra day.

254
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:21,495
Did you tell him about Lex?

255
00:22:21,663 --> 00:22:25,565
I thought it better to keep that under wraps
until it looks like more of a threat.

256
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:28,293
Unfortunately,
I'm afraid that time has come.

257
00:22:28,469 --> 00:22:30,630
Excuse the intrusion, the door was open.

258
00:22:30,805 --> 00:22:32,102
What are you doing here?

259
00:22:34,576 --> 00:22:38,512
Clark didn't tell you?
He came to see me.

260
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:46,216
Your son has always had...

261
00:22:46,554 --> 00:22:48,488
...a penchant for secrecy.

262
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:52,519
Mom, can you give us a minute?

263
00:22:53,127 --> 00:22:54,526
Sure.

264
00:22:56,731 --> 00:22:58,062
Martha, l--

265
00:22:58,232 --> 00:23:00,393
Would you...

266
00:23:00,568 --> 00:23:03,002
...give my best wishes to your--?
To Jonathan.

267
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:09,599
I'm sure it must be a challenge for him
to run the farm in his weakened condition.

268
00:23:09,777 --> 00:23:13,474
Don't worry about Jonathan, he'll be fine.

269
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:18,347
His strength of character
will see us through anything.

270
00:23:24,492 --> 00:23:26,619
I miss your sage advice, Martha.

271
00:23:28,262 --> 00:23:32,824
There's always a job waiting for you if you
ever want to come back to LuthorCorp.

272
00:23:45,446 --> 00:23:48,745
Thank you, Clark, for letting me know
what Lex has been up to.

273
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:52,181
Unfortunately, our collective
meddling has...

274
00:23:52,353 --> 00:23:54,913
...convinced him to accelerate
the whole process.

275
00:23:55,456 --> 00:23:57,686
But he could seriously hurt himself.

276
00:23:57,859 --> 00:24:01,420
I know, but he's an adult, Clark...

277
00:24:02,063 --> 00:24:05,226
...and people have to make
their own mistakes sometimes...

278
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,892
...before they realize they've gone down
the wrong path.

279
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:12,535
What if he doesn't?
What if he comes out of this a vegetable?

280
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:17,942
Well, then I'll have no choice...

281
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:25,080
...but to have him committed again
to Belle Reve. This time permanently.

282
00:24:28,056 --> 00:24:29,717
Where is he?

283
00:24:37,498 --> 00:24:39,125
Where's Lex?

284
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:41,865
How did you get in here?
I'm calling security.

285
00:24:42,036 --> 00:24:45,096
If he continues his experiments,
his father will have him institutionalized.

286
00:24:45,273 --> 00:24:47,833
Lex is well aware of the risks.

287
00:24:50,912 --> 00:24:54,643
What's the matter, Mr. Kent?
You're not looking well.

288
00:24:55,249 --> 00:24:57,683
You have to stop what you're doing.

289
00:25:06,728 --> 00:25:10,186
You've always been intrigued
with my research.

290
00:25:10,531 --> 00:25:15,093
And now you're going to have
the opportunity to be a part of it.

291
00:25:17,205 --> 00:25:18,900
Strip him.

292
00:25:42,296 --> 00:25:44,093
The mouse took the bait.

293
00:25:45,366 --> 00:25:50,326
All right. Now I've delivered my end
of the deal, I expect you to live up to yours.

294
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:54,337
Lex will never undergo another
treatment at Summerholt.

295
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:58,946
Now we can put your talents to use
on a far more interesting project.

296
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:05,141
I want us to begin studying Clark Kent...

297
00:26:06,187 --> 00:26:07,677
...immediately.

298
00:26:38,586 --> 00:26:39,814
We're ready.

299
00:26:39,987 --> 00:26:42,012
I'll feed you the questions, all right?

300
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:45,591
I want to know the truth
about Clark Kent.

301
00:26:47,128 --> 00:26:49,187
Where does he come from?

302
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:01,936
I'm here to see Dr. Garner.

303
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:05,636
Dr. Garner left word with your assistant.
Your session's been canceled.

304
00:27:05,813 --> 00:27:08,543
I got the message.
I wanna speak with him personally.

305
00:27:09,116 --> 00:27:12,108
Well, I'm afraid he's off-site
at a seminar.

306
00:27:16,324 --> 00:27:18,087
Thank you.

307
00:27:29,503 --> 00:27:31,164
Lex, I'm in a meeting.

308
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:35,036
At Summerholt? Is that why Dr. Garner
canceled my session?

309
00:27:35,676 --> 00:27:37,166
I don't have time for this now.

310
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:40,872
Then you better make time
because my treatment worked.

311
00:27:41,382 --> 00:27:43,816
I remember everything.

312
00:27:47,088 --> 00:27:49,886
-Where are you?
- You know where I am, Dad.

313
00:27:54,295 --> 00:27:58,254
I have to solve a problem.
Wait till I get back.

314
00:28:01,535 --> 00:28:03,969
Lower him into the tank.

315
00:28:04,372 --> 00:28:05,805
I'm not waiting for anyone.

316
00:28:24,158 --> 00:28:28,026
Clark, I need you to relax.

317
00:28:28,796 --> 00:28:31,492
Take me back to your earliest memory.

318
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:34,166
Where did you come from?

319
00:28:42,877 --> 00:28:44,902
Put him inside, Lara.

320
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:47,206
Our time has passed.

321
00:28:47,381 --> 00:28:49,349
The hourglass is empty.

322
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:52,315
What if they don't love him?

323
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:56,384
Lara, his destiny is set...

324
00:28:56,691 --> 00:28:58,818
...as is ours.

325
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,195
Goodbye, my sweet Kal-El.

326
00:29:22,883 --> 00:29:27,081
Lara! Lara!

327
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:29,389
Who's Lara, Clark?

328
00:29:31,325 --> 00:29:32,986
Why isn't he responding?

329
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,755
I'm not sure, doctor, but he's having
some sort of reaction to the solution.

330
00:29:37,965 --> 00:29:39,830
-Lara!
-We need to pull him out.

331
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:41,764
No. He hasn't told us what we want.

332
00:29:41,936 --> 00:29:44,234
Lara!

333
00:29:44,405 --> 00:29:45,736
Lex?

334
00:29:47,408 --> 00:29:50,536
Lex, what's so urgent that you needed
to call me out of a meeting?

335
00:29:50,711 --> 00:29:52,042
What's the problem, son?

336
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:53,737
I don't know, Dad.

337
00:29:53,914 --> 00:29:55,939
But the fact that you
co-opted Dr. Garner...

338
00:29:56,117 --> 00:29:59,644
...tells me that you really are scared
of the memories I could recover.

339
00:30:00,087 --> 00:30:01,850
What did you give him?

340
00:30:06,027 --> 00:30:07,358
Shut it down!

341
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,701
-What the hell was that?
-The alarm in the memory well was triggered.

342
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:26,805
Looks like I'm not the only one
playing with fire.

343
00:30:28,249 --> 00:30:29,910
Lex. Lex?

344
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:33,219
Lex!

345
00:31:14,795 --> 00:31:16,126
Clark.

346
00:31:21,168 --> 00:31:24,695
-Lex, help me.
-I'm gonna get you out of here.

347
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:03,041
I wanted to see how you were feeling.

348
00:32:03,777 --> 00:32:06,644
-You looked pretty messed up.
-Yeah, I'll survive.

349
00:32:10,951 --> 00:32:13,419
What were you doing
at Summerholt, Clark?

350
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:17,983
I was trying to save my friend
from making a big mistake.

351
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,127
That was your opinion.

352
00:32:20,294 --> 00:32:23,320
I told you to let it go,
but you kept pursuing it.

353
00:32:23,497 --> 00:32:25,362
You even involved my father.

354
00:32:27,134 --> 00:32:30,069
Believe me, he's the last person
I'd ask for help...

355
00:32:30,237 --> 00:32:34,071
-...but I didn't have any other options.
-He betrayed you, Clark.

356
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:37,733
He stopped my sessions with Garner
by offering you up as a lab rat.

357
00:32:40,247 --> 00:32:44,081
I've tried to keep my father away
from you, but he's obsessed.

358
00:32:44,985 --> 00:32:48,819
If I'd got back those seven weeks,
I could have finally stopped him.

359
00:32:48,989 --> 00:32:51,651
Maybe, Lex,
or maybe you'd make it worse.

360
00:32:54,361 --> 00:32:58,457
You always tell me how you don't want
to turn into your father, and I believe that...

361
00:32:58,632 --> 00:33:01,999
...but the more you two go at each other,
the more like him you become...

362
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:03,932
...and the more people get hurt.

363
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:11,807
I will never become my father.

364
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,739
I would never sacrifice you or anybody
I cared about to bring him down.

365
00:33:27,294 --> 00:33:28,886
Lex...

366
00:33:29,396 --> 00:33:32,126
...why does your father
hate you so much?

367
00:33:38,272 --> 00:33:40,570
Take care of yourself, Clark.

368
00:34:24,118 --> 00:34:25,779
Mom?

369
00:34:27,588 --> 00:34:29,249
Mom?

370
00:34:42,336 --> 00:34:44,304
What did you do?

371
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:48,575
Don't wake the baby. He's sleeping.

372
00:34:58,585 --> 00:35:00,018
No.

373
00:35:00,387 --> 00:35:02,548
No.

374
00:35:06,493 --> 00:35:08,120
What about Dad?

375
00:35:10,364 --> 00:35:13,026
It's nothing to worry about, sweetheart.

376
00:35:14,935 --> 00:35:17,995
Julian's happy now.

377
00:35:37,257 --> 00:35:38,554
No.

378
00:35:48,635 --> 00:35:51,934
Lex? Are you all right?

379
00:35:53,574 --> 00:35:55,007
Yeah.

380
00:35:55,642 --> 00:35:57,337
Yeah, I'm fine.

381
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,827
I see once again you managed to walk away
from a major debacle unscathed.

382
00:36:21,268 --> 00:36:25,762
I was only there at Summerholt,
Lex, because...

383
00:36:26,607 --> 00:36:28,131
...I was concerned about you.

384
00:36:29,977 --> 00:36:31,308
And Clark.

385
00:36:33,714 --> 00:36:35,705
I was as shocked as you were
to find out...

386
00:36:35,883 --> 00:36:38,852
...that Dr. Garner was holding him there
against his will.

387
00:36:40,988 --> 00:36:43,582
In yesterday's melee,
I didn't get a chance to tell you...

388
00:36:43,757 --> 00:36:47,215
-...about a repressed memory I recovered.
-Oh, Lex.

389
00:36:47,394 --> 00:36:49,259
Don't worry, Dad...

390
00:36:50,364 --> 00:36:53,492
...it wasn't about those seven weeks.

391
00:36:56,804 --> 00:36:58,237
It was about Julian.

392
00:37:02,242 --> 00:37:03,834
Yes, well...

393
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:10,007
...we put that tragedy
behind us years ago, didn't we?

394
00:37:11,685 --> 00:37:13,243
I didn't kill him.

395
00:37:21,094 --> 00:37:24,063
Lex, I understand that you need...

396
00:37:24,231 --> 00:37:27,325
...to excuse your behavior, but l....

397
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:34,933
I saw you, Lex.
I saw you standing over Julian's crib.

398
00:37:35,843 --> 00:37:38,311
It's the past. It's history.

399
00:37:45,586 --> 00:37:47,451
Mom did it.

400
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:53,657
I walked in and I found her.

401
00:37:57,731 --> 00:38:00,199
-That's what I repressed.
-Don't you dare.

402
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:03,029
I won't let you desecrate
your mother's memory like that.

403
00:38:03,203 --> 00:38:05,763
I don't blame her. I blame you.

404
00:38:05,939 --> 00:38:07,406
What are you talking about?

405
00:38:07,574 --> 00:38:09,599
Your mother loved Julian.
She would never--

406
00:38:09,776 --> 00:38:13,405
She wasn't capable of murdering
her own child. She loved him.

407
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,880
Loved him so much she couldn't subject him
to your particular brand of parenting.

408
00:38:25,592 --> 00:38:27,457
All right, Lex...

409
00:38:27,628 --> 00:38:29,289
...why would you take the blame...

410
00:38:29,463 --> 00:38:33,957
-...for your brother's death?
-Because I was your sole remaining heir.

411
00:38:34,935 --> 00:38:37,904
I knew you wouldn't let anything
happen to me.

412
00:38:39,706 --> 00:38:41,230
But Mom...

413
00:38:42,709 --> 00:38:45,769
...she would be the lamb to the slaughter.

414
00:39:03,196 --> 00:39:04,629
I....

415
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,061
If I'd known-- lf....

416
00:39:10,003 --> 00:39:12,972
-lf I'd seen....
-What?

417
00:39:15,142 --> 00:39:18,771
Things would've been...

418
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:23,782
...so different between us.

419
00:39:31,592 --> 00:39:33,423
Yes, Dad.

420
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:39,190
You might have actually loved me.

421
00:39:41,969 --> 00:39:43,334
No.

422
00:39:43,837 --> 00:39:45,429
No.

423
00:39:46,473 --> 00:39:47,963
I--

424
00:40:25,812 --> 00:40:29,976
You barely said anything about what
happened at Summerholt.

425
00:40:34,221 --> 00:40:36,553
Don't worry, Mom, my secret's still safe.

426
00:40:42,462 --> 00:40:43,895
Well....

427
00:40:45,532 --> 00:40:48,865
I'll be in the house if you want to talk.

428
00:40:56,176 --> 00:40:57,905
Lara...

429
00:41:02,015 --> 00:41:05,178
...is my biological mother's real name.

430
00:41:07,254 --> 00:41:09,449
How did you know that?

431
00:41:10,023 --> 00:41:13,424
When I was in the tank,
I saw my earliest memory.

432
00:41:14,261 --> 00:41:16,422
She was putting me in the ship.

433
00:41:19,366 --> 00:41:22,358
Her only fear was that
no one would love me.

434
00:41:25,806 --> 00:41:29,537
I can't imagine the agony of putting
my son in a lifeboat...

435
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,304
...and sending him across the stars.

436
00:41:38,919 --> 00:41:41,649
Because of Jor-El, I always thought...

437
00:41:42,889 --> 00:41:46,450
...that my biological parents were monsters,
but she wasn't.

438
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,294
I just can't believe I forgot about her.

439
00:41:54,401 --> 00:41:56,301
You didn't, Clark.

440
00:41:57,237 --> 00:41:59,205
Your first word was "Lara."

441
00:42:01,575 --> 00:42:04,942
Your father and I could never figure out
what it meant.

442
00:42:05,112 --> 00:42:07,080
Now we know.

443
00:42:11,952 --> 00:42:14,216
I wish she could have met you.

444
00:42:14,988 --> 00:42:17,513
To see what a great mom I have.

445
00:42:20,026 --> 00:42:22,085
She knows, Clark.

446
00:42:23,296 --> 00:42:25,821
A mother's love never dies.

447
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
