1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,090
If you don't honor the promise
that you've made to my son,

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,290
I will kill clark kent.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,490
I want you to be there on our wedding
day to see what you lost.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,490
- Lana, we should be together.
- I've had a change of heart.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,490
May I present to you mr.
And mrs. Alexander luthor?

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,890
I found my mom, clark.
She's in a mental institution.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,590
I never felt rage like that before.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,290
You were angry before you
ever heard of titan.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,590
How could she marry lex?

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,890
I don't know, clark,but she made her choice.

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,490
Mom?

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,990
What could be more urgent than lex luthor
developing an army of superfreaks?

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,090
I'm some kind of meteor freak, aren't I?

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,490
We don't know that.

15
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,390
There were complications.

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,290
- We lost the baby.
- No.

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,490
March 29,1995

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,590
Mom!Mom!

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,890
Mom, mom, I want you to be
the first to read it.

20
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,690
"Long live the loch ness monster."

21
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,890
Mr. Hedgis said it was my best story yet --

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,490
even better than the one about
the alien abduction.

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,690
Something tells me those aren't happy tears.

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,290
What's wrong?

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,990
I'm so proud of you...
my little cub reporter.

26
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,490
Chloe, I'm so --I'm so sorry.

27
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,890
Wait. For what?

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,590
You didn't do anything.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,790
It's time,mrs. Sullivan.

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,990
Mom, who are those people?
Where are you going?

31
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,590
Mommy's just going on a little vacation.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,590
By yourself?

33
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,090
Don't you worry.

34
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,190
Your daddy's gonna take good care of you.

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,390
But nobody goes on a vacation by themselves.

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,390
When are you coming back?

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,590
12 Years Later

38
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,790
I hope you're calling with good news, doctor.

39
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,190
well***

40
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,790
***

41
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,790
Yeah, well, she wouldn't be the first freak
who refused to show her true colors.

42
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,590
Keep pressing.

43
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,690
i***

44
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,490
I want answers.

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,390
What do you want?

46
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,090
Thanks, lex.

50
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,090
Chloe?

51
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,590
Hey, we were supposed to meet
for coffee this morning.

52
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,590
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I guess I must have slept in.

53
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,190
After a run in the mud?

54
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,890
What -- did you forget to wipe your feet?

55
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,290
All I remember is I was doing my dishes
here at the apartment

56
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,090
and then I'm waking up in bed.

57
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,290
Maybe you're sleepwalking.

58
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,790
Last night, possibly,but this isn't the first
time this has happened.

59
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,490
Two days ago,I was typing on my
computer at the daily planet,

60
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,190
and then, boom, I'm waking up
at home the next morning.

61
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,190
Clark, do you think maybe something's
starting to happen to me,

62
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,690
like in a krypto-freak kind of way?

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,190
Hey, don't reporters usually deal in facts,
not jumping to conclusions?

64
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,190
Yeah, I know.

65
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,590
It's just that ever since I found out that
I'm a member of the meteor-infected masses,

66
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,590
I've been seriously and secretly freaking out.

67
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,590
I don't blame you.

68
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,090
You don't have to go through this alone,
all right?

69
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,790
Come on, I'll give you a ride to work.

70
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,790
Okay.

71
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,590
Lex, what happened?

72
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,890
I was in a little fender bender last night.

73
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,690
Why didn't you wake me?

74
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,590
Lana, you've been dealing with so much lately.

75
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,190
I wanted to let you sleep.

76
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,490
It seems like you're not sleeping much anyway.

77
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,190
I haven't told anyone yet.

78
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,890
Somehow, saying I lost the baby out
loud makes it more real.

79
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,390
I know.

80
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,490
I'm hurting as much as you are.

81
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,490
The last sonogram,
the baby was perfectly healthy.

82
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,590
Lana, I promise,give it time,
and we'll have a house full of beautiful children.

83
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,590
What if there's something wrong with me?

84
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,990
What if that's why I lost the baby?

85
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,290
You can't do that to yourself.

86
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,790
Dr. Albright told us,1/3 of all pregnancies
miscarry with no rhyme or reason.

87
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,990
I want a complete checkup.

88
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,490
I want every test possible
to find out what went wrong.

89
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,190
Absolutely.

90
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,990
I'll make an appointment immediately.

91
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,790
Now, you get some rest.

92
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,390
Chloe, when you blacked out at the planet,
do you remember what you were working on?

93
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,390
Just a story about tree planting in circle park.

94
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,690
I mean,nothing controversial.

95
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,090
Is that lex's car out there?

96
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,390
Let's go see what's going on.

97
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,790
Chloe, no offense, but I think
lex can get his own aaa.

98
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,790
Something doesn't seem right.
Let's turn around.

99
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,590
Come on.

100
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,490
Looks like the police got here
before lex's cleanup crew could mop up.

101
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,490
That luthorcorp security guard
just grabbed his cellphone.

102
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,590
It's time to perk up those ears.

103
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,590
Jackson, what do you got?

104
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,690
I searched the car and surrounding areas.

105
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,690
The flash drive is gone,mr. Luthor.

106
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,690
Whoever ran you off the road must have taken it.

107
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,090
Okay. Bye.

108
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,590
What is it?

109
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,690
Lex didn't crash by himself.
He had a little help.

110
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,790
And whoever it is stole his flash drive.

111
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,590
Do we know who racer "x" is?

112
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,690
No, but their vision's only 20/20.

113
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,390
What's that?

114
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,790
What's what?Did you find lex's flash drive?

115
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,190
Did you just --

116
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,890
I found something.

117
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,390
It's a button.

118
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,190
That's my button.

119
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,590
Chloe, either this is some bizarre coincidence,
or you --

120
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,390
I was here last night.

121
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,090
Do the math, clark.

122
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,490
The muddy boots,the missing button.It's me.

123
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,690
I'm the road warrior.

124
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,090
Chloe, before you throw the book at yourself,
there's probably another explanation.

125
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,890
Can you explain this?

126
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,890
Let's face it.

127
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,890
I'm guilty as charged.

128
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,590
Chloe, whatever you did,
you clearly weren't yourself.

129
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,090
CONFIDENTIAL

130
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,190
There's onlyne document on here,
and it's a krypto-freak's case file.

131
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,690
Is there a name?

132
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,890
It just lists an I.D. Number.

133
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,090
With a serious ability.

134
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,690
They're suspected of being able to control
meteor freaks.

135
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,390
Look, whoever this is,
I think they controlled me.

136
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,890
Chloe, of all the people in the world,

137
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,990
why would they choose you
to run lex off the road?

138
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,490
Date of birth --september 20, 1960.

139
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,490
Born in granville, kansas.

140
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,890
Oh, my god, clark.

141
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,890
That's my mom.

142
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,790
I want to see my daughter.

143
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,890
You'll get to see chloe.

144
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,190
We just need to take things slowly.

145
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,590
The drug you've been given is still
in its experimental stage.

146
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,690
We wouldn't want your ability to throw
you back into a catatonic state.

147
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,090
Whatever ability you think I have
is a figment of your imagination.

148
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,290
In your medical file,you claimed
you committed yourself

149
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,090
because you had the power
to control your daughter.

150
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,190
Whenever you touched one of her possessions,

151
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,790
you could make her do whatever you wanted.

152
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,690
I was sick, mentally ill.

153
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,090
Whatever I said was the product
of a delusional mind.

154
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,590
Delusions don't short-circuit your brain.

155
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,890
You can thank your incredible power for that.

156
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,890
And maybe -- maybe it's wishful thinking,

157
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:42,290
but I'm willing to bet you can use that power
to control others just like her.

158
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,390
Whatever connection I have to chloe
is because I'm her mother.

159
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,590
We have a bond.

160
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,090
You certainly do.

161
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,990
You both happen to have traces
of meteor rock in your bloodstream.

162
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,690
I have to see chloe.

163
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,790
Of course.

164
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,090
I'm not one to stand in the way
of a mother-daughter reunion.

165
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,290
I just need you to demonstrate
your powers for me.

166
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,590
There's nothing to demonstrate.

167
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,090
I've never been able
to control anyone but chloe.

168
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,590
Well, I suppose there's
a first time for everything.

169
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,190
Chloe, wasn't your mom
catatonic the last time you saw her?

170
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,190
Look, I don't often play late-night bumper cars.

171
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,790
She was obviously controlling me.
The question is why.

172
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,590
We don't know anything for sure yet.

173
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,290
My mom can manipulate krypto-freaks,

174
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,390
and whether we want to admit it or not,
I'm part of that demographic.

175
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,290
Hi.Chloe sullivan.
I'm here to see my mother,moira sullivan.

176
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,290
Did you not understand us the first time?

177
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,890
You were asked never to come back here.

178
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,790
I'm sorry. There must be some sort of mistake.

179
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,290
She hasn't been here for months.

180
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,090
Your friend created a huge scene yesterday.

181
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,290
We don't want a repeat performance.

182
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,590
Well, there's no matinee scheduled.
I just want to see my mom.

183
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,690
Security's on its way.

184
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,290
I suggest you leave before
they have to escort you out.

185
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,090
My mother is here.

186
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,390
You can't prevent her from seeing her own mom.

187
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,890
Chloe, come here.

188
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,890
Clark, what are you doing?
I'm not gonna let them tell me --

189
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,390
just wait for me outside.Trust me.

190
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,590
Time for a little show-and-tell,mrs. Sullivan.

191
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,090
What do you want from me?

192
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,890
Give her all you got,lowell.

193
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,690
Stop.

194
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,490
Sit down.

195
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,290
I already told him.
I'm here to pick up my mother.

196
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,190
Apparently,per her doctor's orders,
moira sullivan's been transferred.

197
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,690
Without notifying me?

198
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,890
- You'll have to ask her psychiatrist.
- Fine.Where is he?

199
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,390
I'm afraid he's out of town at a conference.

200
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,690
- You're lying.
- You can't go in there.

201
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,190
Security!

202
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,790
I can't believe I did that.

203
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,890
Your mom must have sent you
to the sanitarium for help.

204
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,490
She didn't know she had
already been transferred.

205
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,090
So, she had me steal lex's flash drive
so I could find out where she really was.

206
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,590
Well, either way,
she's sending out an S.O.S.

207
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,790
We got it loud and clear.Let's go talk to lex.

208
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,890
I swear to you, I never knew
I could control anyone else.

209
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,890
Come on.

210
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,490
You're more talented than
you give yourself credit for.

211
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,490
And now it's time to put
those talents to good use.

212
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,990
This man is a violent psychopath.

213
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,990
Good for him.
What does that have to do with me?

214
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,290
He escaped from this facility last night.

215
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,390
I need you to send him back here.

216
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,790
I am not going to be used.

217
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,890
Really?

218
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,290
See, I had this notion that seeing your daughter
was a high priority.

219
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:02,190
But considering you were able to abandon her
when she needed you the most,maybe not.

220
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,990
I know what it's like to lose
my mother, mrs. Sullivan.

221
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,090
You don't get over it.

222
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,690
Bring this man back to me...

223
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,190
and I'll make sure you see your daughter.

224
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,190
This belongs to him.

225
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,390
Find lex luthor.

226
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,490
Then kill him.

227
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,090
- Where's lex luthor?
- Who are you?

228
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,690
Tell me where he is.

229
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,290
You shouldn't have done that.

230
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,590
- Lana?
- Clark,she needs a doctor.

231
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,990
We got to get her to the hospital right away.

232
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,890
What about him?

233
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,390
I can handle him.

234
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,490
Clark, she's pregnant.Go.

235
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,790
Now.

236
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,690
What the hell are you doing?

237
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,790
Believe me,I can pull this trigger a lot faster
than you can flinch.

238
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,890
The last thing I remember,
I was running on the train tracks.

239
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,390
And when you woke up,
your memory was gone.

240
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,190
You know my mother.

241
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,590
Moira sullivan --where is she?

242
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,390
I don't know who you're talking about.

243
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,890
I was kept in this facility
with a bunch of other people with powers.

244
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,390
Where is the facility?

245
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,490
Well, the good news is,
there's no sign of a concussion.

246
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,790
But because of your recent miscarriage,
I would like to run a few tests just to be safe.

247
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,890
- Thank you.
- Okay.

248
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,690
Lana?

249
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,490
I heard what happened.Are you okay?

250
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,490
I guess that depends on your definition.

251
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,990
Is the baby all right?

252
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,290
I lost it a few days after the wedding.

253
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,690
You're the first person I've told.

254
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,090
I'm so sorry.

255
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,790
I feel like I've lost so much...

256
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,090
...that having this baby would change things,but...

257
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,690
now that it's gone...

258
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,990
...this isn't the life that I wanted.

259
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,990
Does this have anything to do
with what happened the day of your wedding?

260
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,090
You told me you weren't gonna marry lex,
and then, all of a sudden,somehow...

261
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,790
something changed your mind.What was it?

262
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,290
It was just wedding-day jitters,that's all.

263
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,490
Lana...

264
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,890
it was more than that.

265
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,690
I can help you.

266
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,090
You don't need to be afraid.Whatever you need --

267
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,590
clark, I need you to stop worrying about me.

268
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,690
It's okay, really.

269
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,290
I'm going to get through this
like I always do.

270
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,290
When my wife ends up in the hospital,
that means you've made a grave mistake.

271
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,690
I didn't mean for anyone else to get hurt.

272
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,490
I just wanted you to suffer.

273
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,890
Well, clearly chloe gets her brazenness
from her mother's side.

274
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,390
But as meddlesome as she can be,
I've actually come to admire her.

275
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,790
That's what makes this so difficult.

276
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,190
You stay away from my daughter.

277
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,490
Oh, it's too late for that.

278
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,390
Clark?

279
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,190
Clark?

280
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,390
Clark?

281
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,990
- Hey. How's lana?
- She's okay.

282
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,490
What'd you find out?

283
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,490
My mom was playing simon says with that guy
at the mansion,which means she's desperate.

284
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,890
He told mewhere I could find her.

285
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,990
Can we trust him?

286
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,690
Well, there is an old, abandoned hospital
on paper mill road,

287
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,690
just like he said,and it's owned by --

288
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,990
luthorcorp.

289
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,290
It's probably another 33.1 franchise.

290
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,490
I was gonna go check it out,

291
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,590
but I thought it would be more wise
for me to come get my army of one.

292
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:31,890
Chloe, get out of smallville, sweetheart,
as fast as you can.

293
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,990
- Where you going?
- I have to leave.

294
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,890
- Chloe --
- let me go, clark.

295
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,690
I have to leave town.

296
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,990
I'm not letting you go anywhere.

297
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,790
What's going on?

298
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,590
It's your mom trying to control you again.

299
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,590
Oh, my god.

300
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,990
Are you okay?

301
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,890
Yeah, I'm just dizzy.

302
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,290
- Can you get me a glass of water?
- Yeah.

303
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,690
Sorry, clark,but I have no choice.

304
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,790
Please...don't do this.

305
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,790
It's the only way I'll be able
to get out of smallville.

306
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,790
STOP

307
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,590
- I need to get through.
- Sorry, miss.

308
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,190
No.You don't understand.
I need to leave town right now.

309
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,290
I'm afraid we're gonna have to reroute you.

310
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,890
What are you --

311
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,190
Mom?

312
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,090
Mom!

313
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,190
Chloe.

314
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,490
You're even more beautiful than I remember.

315
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,290
I can't believe you're awake
and you're talking.

316
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,890
I thought I'd never
get to speak to you again.

317
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,290
Honey,you shouldn't be here.

318
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,990
This is all my fault.

319
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,290
No, it's not.

320
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,990
You needed my help.

321
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,990
You're suffering because of what I made you do,

322
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,790
just like when you were little.

323
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,990
What?

324
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,890
Remember when you were 8
and you hurt your hands?

325
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,190
Yeah, how could I forget?

326
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,390
I had to wear those bandages for weeks.

327
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,590
You know, I've never
played kickball since then.

328
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,290
You didn't hurt your hand playing kickball.

329
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,490
You came home from school,

330
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,590
and your hands were all covered in ink.

331
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,090
So, I told you to go wash your hands,
and instead, you --

332
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,290
you went to play with your computer.

333
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,590
I was so frustrated.

334
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,590
I sent you to go wash your hands

335
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,990
and scrub them till all the ink was gone.

336
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,290
Mom, what are you saying?

337
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,390
I found you in the bathroom.

338
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,890
There was blood everywhere.

339
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,190
You had scrubbed your hands raw.

340
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,590
That's why I left --

341
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,790
to protect you from me.

342
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,690
And now I have to protect you from lex luthor.

343
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,190
This man that brought you here --

344
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,990
he knows you're infected.

345
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,190
You have to get out of here.

346
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,590
No. We have to get out of here.

347
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,190
Mom, you can control people with powers.

348
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,690
Is there anyone in here
whose ability could free us?

349
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,190
I'd love to.

350
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,990
Yes, lunch before the meeting is perfect.

351
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,490
Okay. Bye-bye.

352
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,190
Clark!

353
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,990
Sweetie, wake up!

354
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,290
Clark!

355
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,190
- Mom?
- Oh, baby.

356
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,890
No more experiments.

357
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,790
Keep walking.

358
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,190
Help! I need help in here, please! Help!

359
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,990
My mom -- she's sick.She needs a doctor.

360
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,600
What's wrong?

361
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,290
I don't know,but you have to help her.

362
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,690
Hey! Hey!What the hell?

363
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,490
Mom! Mom!

364
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,390
Protect me and my daughter.Set us free.

365
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,590
Stop!

366
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,590
Hold it right there.

367
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,190
Mom!

368
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,390
Chloe!

369
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,090
Go! Get out of here!

370
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,890
Take her back to the cell.

371
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,590
Chloe, whatever you have to do,get out now.

372
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,590
Lex, get out of my way.

373
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,190
I'm sorry.I can't do that.

374
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,090
Don't let your mother make you
do something you'll later --

375
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,890
Hey!I brought sandwiches.

376
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,190
I don't know which ones you like, mom,
so I bought one of each.

377
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,390
I don't think your mom's hungry.

378
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,290
Have you talked to oliver?

379
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,890
He said that he would set up a safe place
for her to stay in star city.

380
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,290
Chloe,we have a problem.

381
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,490
Mom?

382
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,990
Mom?

383
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,390
I-I wanted to see a blue sky...

384
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,990
one last time.

385
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,990
Well, there will be plenty of blue skies
where you're going, mom.

386
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,090
You're not gonna be locked inside anymore.

387
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,690
Sweetheart...

388
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,890
...I'm slipping back.

389
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,190
The drug that lex used on your mom --
it only lasts 24 hours,

390
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,490
or else she won't stay lucid.

391
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,890
Chloe, she doesn't have much time left.

392
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,390
Well, I'll go talk to lex.
I'll make a deal with him.

393
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,590
No.No deals with that man.

394
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,790
I can't allow it.

395
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,790
Mom, I already lost you once.
I'm not gonna do it again.

396
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,290
If this drug is out there,
I can get it, trust me.

397
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,890
I have some pretty amazing
resources at my disposal.

398
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,290
Being with you again.

399
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,790
...It's the greatest gift
I could have ever been given.

400
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,490
But I'm dangerous, chloe.

401
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,590
No, mom.That's not true.

402
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:26,290
My ability to control people with powers,

403
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,690
it's like I'm a human weapon.

404
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,190
And I-I can't --I can't allow it.

405
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,690
But, mom, it doesn't have to be like this.

406
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,790
My little cub reporter.

407
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,290
This...

408
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,790
this belongs...

409
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,590
...to you.

410
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,590
No, mom. Please.

411
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,290
Please don't go, mom --

412
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,190
not yet, not again.

413
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,290
I...

414
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,090
...love you...

415
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,790
...chlo-- chloe.

416
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,390
I love you, too, mom.

417
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,290
"Luthorcorp crimesagainst humanity."

418
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,090
That's catchy.

419
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,090
Too bad it'll never make it to print.

420
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,590
Lex, I'm tired of playing hardball
or softball or any ball,for that matter.

421
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,490
Game's over.

422
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,690
I'll tell you, your audacity's impressive, chloe,

423
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,390
especially given your recent late-night activities.

424
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,990
What?

425
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,790
You don't remember?

426
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,290
You ran my car off the road a few nights ago.

427
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,590
Investigators have boot prints,

428
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,890
hair fibers,samples of the mud found
in your apartment.

429
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,790
***

430
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,890
How many years do you get for
aggravated assault -- 10, 20?

431
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,590
For what you've done, they're
gonna throw away the key.

432
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,690
What I've done?

433
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,990
You don't have a shred of proof
about any of this,and you never will.

434
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,090
But rest assured,

435
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,390
the evidence I have against
you is locked away safe and secure.

436
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,190
Make that article disappear,

437
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,990
and you'll remain a free woman.

438
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,890
Deal?

439
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,690
My mother sacrificed everything
to protect the world from scum like you.

440
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,790
And if taking you down means spending some
quality time behind bars,sign me up.

441
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,590
You know, I thought you might say that.

442
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,290
That's why there's a plan "b"
firmly in place...

443
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,090
...a plan that makes prison
look like a picnic.

444
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,490
SMALLVILLE MEDICAL CENTER

445
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,090
Well, now, mrs. Luthor.

446
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,690
I did an extensive battery of tests,

447
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,290
and actually,I found something quite troubling.

448
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,490
What is it?What's wrong?

449
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,690
Did you give yourself injections,
or did you take pills?

450
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,390
I took prenatal vitamins.That's it.

451
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,690
Vitamins don't cause fatigue,nausea,

452
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,890
and the suspension of your menstrual cycle.

453
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,690
Synthetic hormones do.

454
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,490
Synthetic hormones?What do you mean?

455
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,590
That's what we found in your bloodstream.

456
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,090
That's what you took to fake a pregnancy

457
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,990
and to force a marriage to a billionaire.

458
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,790
When you stopped taking them,

459
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,490
it appeared as if you'd simply
miscarried, didn't it?

460
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,490
I don't understand.

461
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,690
I saw the sonograms.I saw my baby.

462
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,390
I don't know whose baby you saw,
but I can assure you,it wasn't yours.

463
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,890
I was never pregnant.

464
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,190
- Hey.
- Hey.

465
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,490
You okay?

466
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,390
How you doing?

467
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,690
it's just so unfair.

468
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,890
I mean, she's never gonna be able to read
any of the articles I've written,

469
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,790
you know, or meet jimmy.

470
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,890
She's never gonna get to know
the person that I've become.

471
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,690
It's a good thing I told her.

472
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,190
You did?

473
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,390
After I brought your mom to oliver's apartment,

474
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,190
I gave her the complete chloe sullivan bio.

475
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,790
She was so proud.

476
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,490
That's something
no one can ever take away.

477
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,390
Lex came to talk to me, clark.

478
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,490
Basically, he said
it's either kill or be killed.

479
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,290
The story or me.

480
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,090
He threatened you?

481
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,490
I'm in his cross hairs.

482
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,790
Yeah, well,now he's in mine.

483
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,590
Think about lana.

484
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,190
We can't do anything to him
until we know she's safe.

485
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,990
You're right.

486
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,290
He'd feed her to the lions
just to spite me.

487
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,590
But it's inevitable.

488
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,490
The war's about to begin.

if christopher reeve
was a real-life superman,

then dana reeve would be his lois lane.

494
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,290
Dana symbolized hope to the millions
living with paralysis

495
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,790
through her tireless work on behalf
of the caregiver community.

committed to dana's work but needs your help.

Be a superhero to those with paralysis

engraved with the superman logo
and the foundation's slogan,"go forward."

All proceeds go towards funding innovative resrch
