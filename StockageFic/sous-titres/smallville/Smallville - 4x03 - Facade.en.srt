Freshman year 2001

2
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:13,876
Are we going to state this year?

3
00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:14,901
Yeah!

4
00:00:15,387 --> 00:00:18,454
I can't hear ya! Who's going
to be the state champions?

5
00:00:18,471 --> 00:00:20,203
The crows!

6
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,174
I need a brave freshman to step up.

7
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:27,605
Alright, which one of you studs
thinks you're a better quarterback than me?

8
00:00:28,813 --> 00:00:30,231
Kent, how about it?

9
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:32,244
Huh?

10
00:00:33,244 --> 00:00:34,352
That's okay.

11
00:00:34,554 --> 00:00:39,466
You too busy milking cows to come and try out for the team.
The least you can do is show some school spirit.

12
00:00:40,503 --> 00:00:41,985
Am I right?

13
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:46,713
Come on, kent,do you wanna take a shot
at the hottest freshman at smallville high?

14
00:00:48,428 --> 00:00:49,862
Come on, Clark!

15
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:01,487
Just take your time.

16
00:01:01,524 --> 00:01:03,808
Come on Clark, you can do it.

17
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:09,667
Caw! Caw!
Go, crows! Whoo!

18
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:13,572
Go, clark, you can do it!

19
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:17,866
- Crows! Whoo-hoo!
- Yay, crows! Who's the lucky freshman this year?

20
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,248
Probably the biggest loser like every year.

21
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:22,280
Come on, take it off.

22
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:24,818
- Hey, leave her alone.
- Stop, you guys!

23
00:01:24,995 --> 00:01:29,323
Or what? We always torture
the mascot, kent. It's a tradition.

24
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:30,945
Leave me alone.

25
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:32,640
Stop, you...

26
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:36,945
Scabby abby

27
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:38,802
Scabby abby!

28
00:01:40,424 --> 00:01:44,021
Scabby abby!

29
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:57,670
Put your mask back on, scabster!

30
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,668
All right, who's next? Who's
gonna step up and dunk her?

31
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:19,635
Poor baby.

32
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:24,352
It's taken three years,
but you finally let mommy help you.

33
00:02:26,682 --> 00:02:28,453
Don't worry, sweetheart.

34
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,950
I won't let you waste your senior year
like you did all the others.

35
00:02:33,137 --> 00:02:35,334
You promise people will like me?

36
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:37,587
They will. I promise.

37
00:02:37,676 --> 00:02:39,639
Just like they did me.

38
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,026
Everyone will love you when they see the real you...

39
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,645
the one that's been inside all along.

40
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:05,602
You're going to have a senior year
no one will ever forget.

45
00:04:09,137 --> 00:04:14,445
What a ball game! It's all tied up.
Five seconds left here at metro stadium.

46
00:04:14,482 --> 00:04:19,480
Clark kent, the young phenom from smallville,
has led M.U.'S incredible comeback.

47
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:23,092
Kent takes the snap from his own
10-yard line. It's hail mary time.

48
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,623
He fades back... here's the pass

49
00:04:25,844 --> 00:04:29,971
a bullet deep downfield
way past his own receiver.

50
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:35,458
Wait! Kent's now flying down the field.
He's going to catch his own pass! Touchdown!

51
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:40,034
The meteors win! Kent is unbelievable!

52
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:46,220
Nice arm, farm boy.

53
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:48,962
When's the first game?

54
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:52,666
- I'm not on the team.
- Why not?

55
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:55,761
An arm like that is a
"get out of geek free" pass.

56
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:58,778
- Well, even if I wanted to play
- Which obviously you do.

57
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:00,709
That wouldn't be the reason.

58
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:04,336
Thanks. I don't really consider myself a geek.

59
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:06,526
So...

60
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:09,224
what do you see yourself as?

61
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:11,258
I don't know.

62
00:05:11,297 --> 00:05:13,457
An outsider, I guess.

63
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:16,840
That's a recipe for wedgies
if I've ever heard one.

64
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:18,904
Have I told you how much
I'm going to miss you?

65
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:24,025
Daddy...

66
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:28,514
don't you have 3,000 guys to baby sit?

67
00:05:28,551 --> 00:05:30,792
Do you really need
to keep checking up on me?

68
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:32,989
It would appear that way.

69
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:36,541
I know that I'm late, but I can still
make it to campus for orientation.

70
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,512
Save yourself a trip. Met. U.
Just yanked your acceptance.

71
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,437
What? They can't do that.

72
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,017
They can if you don't have
enough credits to finish high school.

73
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:47,862
Look, I know I missed a few classes, but...

74
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:50,378
lo, you failed the last semester.

75
00:05:56,053 --> 00:06:01,170
Not to worry, though. I'm sure that clark
will be happy to show you around.

76
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:03,720
- Around where?
- Around where?

77
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:07,008
Bright and early, tomorrow morning.

78
00:06:07,317 --> 00:06:09,685
You start smallville high.

79
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:15,664
Great.

80
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:27,789
You know, socially divisive cliques and hall
passes aside, this place really is not all that bad.

81
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:33,046
It's the varsity version of dante's seventh ring.

82
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:36,894
Come on, do you know how many people
would kill to relive their senior year in high school?

83
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,830
Make that semester. Five more credits,
and I amoutta this cowpile.

84
00:06:40,874 --> 00:06:43,244
Wait a minute. Five credit sin one semester?

85
00:06:43,288 --> 00:06:47,003
Lois, the only way you're going to do that is
if you add an extracurricular to your class load.

86
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:49,951
Like, say, maybe... writing for the "torch. "

87
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:51,316
Uh,

88
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:55,621
no hard feelings here, cuz, but, unlike you,
the last thing I want to be is a reporter.

89
00:06:55,665 --> 00:07:00,487
What could be worse than, you know,
uncovering the truth and protecting the public?

90
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:02,521
And sticking your nose in other people's business.

91
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:04,600
Like I said, you'd be perfect.

92
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,380
Come on. Let's go.

93
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:12,378
It's gonna be great having you here.

94
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,513
- Check it out.
- A new girl...

95
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,264
Hi, clark.

96
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:38,824
Abby?

97
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:41,375
It's actually Abigail now.

98
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:46,546
You know, I almost didn't recognize you.

99
00:07:47,077 --> 00:07:50,571
After an entire summer of recovery,

100
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,809
good.

101
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:57,440
With any luck, this old locker will be the only thing
that stays the same this year.

102
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:01,022
Yeah, um,that shouldn't be a problem.

103
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:02,785
So, uh,

104
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:04,863
why the, uh..

105
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,089
change?

106
00:08:09,914 --> 00:08:12,066
I guess just one day you realize you can

107
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,633
can spend another year being
resentful of what everybody else has

108
00:08:15,677 --> 00:08:18,213
or you can do something about it.

109
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,557
You know, it's our senior year, clark.

110
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,709
This is my last chance.

111
00:08:27,328 --> 00:08:30,129
Good morning, clark. Hey... abby.

112
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:37,479
Whoa. Either she spent an entire summer at a collagen
farm, or I am shopping at the wrong makeup counter.

113
00:08:37,553 --> 00:08:42,309
How old is she 17? That's like messing with the
batter before the cookies are even baked.

114
00:08:42,382 --> 00:08:45,449
Don't tell me the world
isn't nicer to prettier people.

115
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:50,779
Besides, you know,I mean, it's her body. And if it
makes her feel better, then it's none of our business.

116
00:08:52,843 --> 00:08:53,964
What?

117
00:08:55,063 --> 00:08:59,950
I'm just stunned that miss "letter to the editor"
doesn't find it one bit distressing that a girl would get

118
00:08:59,978 --> 00:09:02,765
nipped and tucked to fit into some plastic pod person...

119
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,473
I think she looks great.

120
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:06,741
What a shocker.

121
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:10,274
Look, that's the problem
with high school. It's all a facade.

122
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,074
Everyone's hiding who they really are
and trying to be something they're not.

123
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:15,762
Well, it sounds like you've got your first article.

124
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:17,447
See you in the "torch. "

125
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:21,946
Okay, I'll write for your paper,
but you better get me extra credit.

126
00:09:36,854 --> 00:09:38,899
- Hey.
- Hey.

127
00:09:43,772 --> 00:09:46,208
A note through the vent of my locker.

128
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:47,860
Very creative.

129
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:51,674
Well, I pride myself on being able
to revert back to the fourth grade.

130
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,609
What are you doing here? If we get
caught, I could get detention.

131
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:57,499
I could get fired.

132
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:02,054
Coach teague.

133
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,397
I'm Clark Kent.

134
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:09,437
Hi.

135
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,658
Lana.

136
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,116
What are you doing here?

137
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:18,893
- Um, I, uh...
- The principal asked this

138
00:10:18,935 --> 00:10:21,987
young lady to give me the grand tour.

139
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:24,382
It's good to meet you, Clark.

140
00:10:25,754 --> 00:10:28,139
You know, they didn't tell me
you were Jason Teague.

141
00:10:29,064 --> 00:10:33,810
This guy threwa passing record his freshman year
at metropolis university. He could've gone pro.

142
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:37,063
Yeah, well, now I'm just a transfer
to central kansas a&M.

143
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:40,745
It's amazing how quickly you fall of
recruiters' lists when you tear your rotator cuff.

144
00:10:41,796 --> 00:10:45,412
Well, then, I, uh, I guess we're
lucky to have you here, coach.

145
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,107
Assistant coach,

146
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:48,493
miss lang.

147
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:53,394
Um, quigley's still going to be
calling the plays for you guys.

148
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:55,639
Well, actually, I'm not on the team.

149
00:10:58,229 --> 00:11:00,119
I was hoping I could try out.

150
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,248
You look big enough. Sure.

151
00:11:05,476 --> 00:11:06,569
The talon.

152
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:07,591
Lex,

153
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:10,503
uh, agreed to let me manage it.

154
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:12,372
Why?

155
00:11:12,478 --> 00:11:16,820
I was lucky to find a job at all, jonathan.
It's not like I have a full résumé these days.

156
00:11:16,862 --> 00:11:17,997
Sweetheart,

157
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:20,755
if we're so worried about money,
then why don't we just go

158
00:11:20,783 --> 00:11:22,841
through the books again?
We'll find some other place to cut.

159
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:26,200
Like where? We've been over
it every week for two months.

160
00:11:26,242 --> 00:11:31,283
There's no way we can get out from under
these hospital bills. I'm not blaming you. I just...

161
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:36,458
I just don't want to keep waiting and risk
losing the farm. ou've worked too hard.

162
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:38,810
Yeah, so that you wouldn't have to.

163
00:11:39,944 --> 00:11:42,605
It's not so bad right now.

164
00:11:43,218 --> 00:11:48,329
You have the farm, and clark is going to go off
to college next year. I need something of my own.

165
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:50,919
But why does it have to be with the luthors?

166
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:55,877
I'll be selling espressos, jonathan,
not masterminding hostile takeovers.

167
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,314
Well...

168
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:01,310
I've always known that

169
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:04,209
you wanted to have more than just this old farm.

170
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:08,104
I'm not going to be the one to stand in your way.

171
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:11,632
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- You're welcome.

172
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:13,817
Hey, kent,

173
00:12:13,904 --> 00:12:16,397
I need your permission slip, bud.

174
00:12:23,354 --> 00:12:25,146
What positions have you played?

175
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,935
None, actually. I've never been on a team before.

176
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:32,398
My father wasn't too keen on the whole idea.

177
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,533
Your dad doesn't know you're here, does he?

178
00:12:36,563 --> 00:12:39,447
When it comes to defying fathers,
I'm kind of a pro.

179
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,348
I'm not doing this for him.

180
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:47,171
You know, I've seen a lot of guys

181
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:50,489
join the team just so they can walk
around in a letterman's jacket.

182
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:53,556
Because they want people to look at them differently.

183
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,097
But football's just a game.

184
00:12:58,427 --> 00:13:00,905
If you want to change, you gotta do that yourself.

185
00:13:01,927 --> 00:13:03,261
That's why I'm here.

186
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,019
All right. Let's see what you got.

187
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:22,599
All right, kent.

188
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,092
Do something to us.

189
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:33,036
All right, guys, let's go!

190
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,493
Alright guys, On two...

191
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:47,174
hut! Hut!

192
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:57,328
All right, that'll work.

193
00:13:57,356 --> 00:13:59,499
Line up again, guys.
Oh, man!

194
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,935
Checkout Scabby abby.

195
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:04,778
It's fake, you know.

196
00:14:04,806 --> 00:14:06,206
Who cares...

197
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:10,054
Are you kidding me?

198
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,560
Men, is she hot...

199
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,473
Whoo!Yeah!

200
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:34,907
I didn't mean to scare you.

201
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:37,974
Just... I can't stop thinking about you.

202
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:42,333
You mean the girl you nicknamed "scabby abby"?

203
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:45,105
Yeah, I totally deserved that.

204
00:14:45,945 --> 00:14:49,996
Maybe if I'd been more patient,
I would've seen who you really are.

205
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,012
The most...

206
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:54,561
beautiful girl in school.

207
00:15:07,827 --> 00:15:10,096
I have a lot to apologize for.

208
00:15:11,104 --> 00:15:12,588
What do you say

209
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:16,019
we go some place a little more quiet?

210
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:30,261
Where are we going?

211
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:28,911
What are you doing?

212
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:30,521
You didn't feel that?

213
00:16:31,436 --> 00:16:32,808
Of course I did.

214
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,259
No. I..

215
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:36,785
I should go.

216
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:39,684
What's going on?

217
00:16:39,768 --> 00:16:41,364
Abigail, wait.

218
00:16:41,795 --> 00:16:46,752
Oh, I get it. New face... same old, boring scabby.

219
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,603
Hey!

220
00:16:57,552 --> 00:16:58,784
Oh, my god.

221
00:16:58,802 --> 00:16:59,769
Bret?

222
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:02,513
What's happening?

223
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:04,431
What's wrong?

224
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:05,832
Oh, my god.

225
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:08,566
My face.

226
00:17:08,846 --> 00:17:10,135
My God...

227
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:12,011
what did you do to me?

228
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,958
No! My face!

229
00:17:17,224 --> 00:17:21,451
Admissions office? Look, I'm in the
nation'scream corn capital, retaking calculus.

230
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:25,083
No, don't put me on hold.
Could this day be any worse?

231
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,943
- No, that's everything.
- Thank you.

232
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,814
Lois,

233
00:17:44,178 --> 00:17:45,411
what's going on?

234
00:17:45,453 --> 00:17:47,609
He just ran right out in front of me.

235
00:17:48,575 --> 00:17:51,786
I don't know. They said he's going
to be okay. Psychically, anyway.

236
00:17:52,094 --> 00:17:54,082
The cops think he kind a lost it.

237
00:17:54,264 --> 00:17:55,384
Who... bret?

238
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:59,346
I just saw him at practice
an hour ago. He was fine.

239
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:00,606
Are you sure about that?

240
00:18:00,648 --> 00:18:01,349
Yeah.

241
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:05,185
Think about it, clark.
It's the start of a new season,

242
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:09,178
scholar ships... the entire town
counting on you to be their hero?

243
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,525
Who knows what kind of neuroses are
hiding behind that big man on campus mask?

244
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:15,031
No way. If anything, bret was too overconfident.

245
00:18:15,185 --> 00:18:16,865
He probably just didn'tsee you.

246
00:18:17,285 --> 00:18:20,339
Yeah, that might explain
the broken windshield, but...

247
00:18:20,451 --> 00:18:23,994
do you want to tell me why he was
running around half naked, soaking wet?

248
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,394
Why would he do that?

249
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:35,782
Hey, hey, last time I checked, you were
missing a few prerequisites for being in here.

250
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,008
So you have been checking me out.

251
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,463
Lois, just wait outside.

252
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,423
Are you kidding?

253
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:46,148
Tortured senior can't keep up
the hometown hero act in buckles?

254
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:50,208
This is as juicy as my teen cosmetic surgery article.

255
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,309
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

256
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:54,353
How well did you know bret anderson?

257
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:56,887
Not as well as I'd like to know you.

258
00:18:57,256 --> 00:18:58,418
Charming.

259
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,577
Look, bret ranin front of my car. Do any
of you guys know what that was all about?

260
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:45,731
Are you used to throughout other people's mail?

261
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,632
Sorry. The box was addressed to the talon.

262
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,771
Something tells me this isn't a
book-of-the-month selection.

263
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,123
What's with

264
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:00,078
this fascination with ancient writings?

265
00:20:01,062 --> 00:20:02,799
School project.

266
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:07,559
That must be the same project
clark's always working on.

267
00:20:08,077 --> 00:20:11,890
For two people so different,
you have remarkably similar interests.

268
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,225
It still amazes mew hat you did with this place.

269
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:21,068
You saw promise in something everyone
else thought was beyond redemption.

270
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:22,577
Huh.

271
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,400
This is a side of lex luthor I've never seen before.

272
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,851
You're coming dangerously close to being nostalgic.

273
00:20:45,388 --> 00:20:47,727
Congratulations are in order.

274
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:52,146
Coach quigley called. You made the football team.

275
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,464
You don't have to worry, dad.
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.

276
00:20:55,758 --> 00:20:57,326
I know how to control my abilities.

277
00:20:57,358 --> 00:21:00,316
The person I'm worried about
you hurting, clark... is yourself.

278
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:07,774
You're gonna be tempted to run just
a little bit faster, to throw the ball...

279
00:21:08,432 --> 00:21:10,911
just far enough to win every game.

280
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,282
You think I'm gonna cheat?

281
00:21:14,786 --> 00:21:19,211
I won't cross that line. You won't
even know where that line is, clark.

282
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:25,964
Come on, think about it. You're out there, your friends are
giving it their all. You're gonna do what ever it takes to win.

283
00:21:26,006 --> 00:21:28,008
That's football, son.

284
00:21:28,695 --> 00:21:32,286
And with you, it's never gonna be a fair competition.

285
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:34,863
Well, let's talk about what's fair.

286
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:38,097
What's the first thing you remember
about high school when you think back?

287
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:40,762
- No, no, no...
- don't tell me it's not football.

288
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,710
I want that, too, dad.

289
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:48,369
And I'm sick of begging for
the same chances that you just had.

290
00:21:50,707 --> 00:21:52,149
I want my own life.

291
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:12,456
You're not the first person to walk
through that door with tattoo remorse.

292
00:22:13,282 --> 00:22:15,830
But you're the first one to do it without ink.

293
00:22:16,223 --> 00:22:17,469
What?

294
00:22:17,623 --> 00:22:19,798
Whatever this pigment is,

295
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,242
it's almost as though the symbol
were branded underneath your skin.

296
00:22:24,502 --> 00:22:27,377
Someone wanted to leave a mark
you wouldn't easily forget.

297
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:30,583
But you can still remove it, right?

298
00:22:30,877 --> 00:22:37,691
Well, I'll have to send this tissue sample off to the lab, but I am
guessing removal won't be possible without a complete skin graft.

299
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:40,029
But we'll see.

300
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:45,686
You go to school with my daughter, don't you?

301
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,314
I never forget a face...

302
00:22:51,113 --> 00:22:54,135
especially a perfect one like yours.

303
00:22:56,977 --> 00:22:59,203
It must get you anything you want, hmm?

304
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:04,297
Abby...

305
00:23:05,334 --> 00:23:08,148
how's bret? I saw you two in the hall.

306
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:10,108
I don't know what you're talking about.

307
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:13,969
I'll talk to you later.

308
00:23:14,837 --> 00:23:15,902
Thank you.

309
00:23:15,972 --> 00:23:18,660
Um, bye. Dr. Fine.

310
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:21,797
What did you do to me?

311
00:23:22,613 --> 00:23:26,758
I kissed this guy,and he freaked out. It was like...
it was like he went insane or something.

312
00:23:26,786 --> 00:23:29,936
You were my first trial at this, abigail.

313
00:23:29,978 --> 00:23:31,564
I mean, there's always potential for complication.

314
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,953
- Complication? Bret's atthe hospital because of me.
- Bret?

315
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:37,964
Isn't this the boy that named you "scabby abby"?

316
00:23:38,202 --> 00:23:40,414
Maybe he got exactly what he deserved.

317
00:23:40,484 --> 00:23:42,071
And lana should, too.

318
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:43,276
Lana?

319
00:23:43,332 --> 00:23:45,866
But lana never did anything to me.

320
00:23:48,975 --> 00:23:53,096
Lana saw the two of you together.
She's already asking questions.

321
00:23:53,138 --> 00:23:54,468
You think she knows?

322
00:23:54,524 --> 00:23:57,395
This is a very serious problem, abigail.

323
00:23:58,893 --> 00:24:00,633
If lana says anything

324
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,826
to anyone about what's happened
between you and this boy,

325
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,898
they'll take all of this away from me.

326
00:24:06,388 --> 00:24:08,363
And without your treatments,

327
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:11,661
you're going to revert back exactly
the way you used to be.

328
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,329
Is that really what you want?

329
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,956
No.

330
00:24:16,184 --> 00:24:18,663
I have done everything for you.

331
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:25,207
And now I need you to do something for me.

332
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:30,807
Yeah.

333
00:24:30,998 --> 00:24:32,035
Okay.

334
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:38,280
It's the old drama room.

335
00:24:38,336 --> 00:24:40,020
Wow..

336
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:45,467
Oh, this is an interesting detour
from the coach's office.

337
00:24:45,495 --> 00:24:47,330
I didn't even know this room existed.

338
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:50,835
Yep. Neither does anyone else, hopefully.

339
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:55,582
I still can't believe that you have a job at my school.

340
00:24:55,638 --> 00:24:56,734
I know.

341
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,249
I guess I'm gonna have to get used
to my guys drooling over you.

342
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,517
I don't think you have anything to worry about.

343
00:25:02,699 --> 00:25:03,795
Yeah?

344
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:06,484
What about clark kent?

345
00:25:10,082 --> 00:25:15,634
I thought that you said you had a surprise
for me. How did this become about clark?

346
00:25:16,236 --> 00:25:18,098
It was strange. He...

347
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,338
He kind a opened up to me today.

348
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:24,460
You have no idea how strange that really is.

349
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,818
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

350
00:25:25,944 --> 00:25:30,159
The thing is, you know, running the
drills and putting together a...

351
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:33,314
a good team is one thing, but...

352
00:25:33,888 --> 00:25:36,576
having guys like clark coming in for advice

353
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:41,565
it's not gonna be so easy when these guys are looking
at me like I'm an adult. I still feel like I'm part of the team.

354
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,249
But this moment isn't about me.

355
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:49,817
No.

356
00:25:51,035 --> 00:25:51,987
Hold on.

357
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:53,051
Okay.

358
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:55,478
It's about this.

359
00:25:55,772 --> 00:25:57,369
- Oh, dear. That would be a blindfold.
- Yes, it would.

360
00:25:57,397 --> 00:25:58,671
Okay.

361
00:25:58,783 --> 00:26:00,855
So, what do you think you're gonna get out of this?

362
00:26:00,911 --> 00:26:02,787
Nothing. It's just that

363
00:26:02,983 --> 00:26:06,092
we never really got to celebrate
somebody's birthday.

364
00:26:06,134 --> 00:26:07,366
Right...

365
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:09,873
so you stay right here.

366
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:11,399
- Okay.
- Okay.

367
00:26:12,953 --> 00:26:14,116
Don't peek.

368
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:28,533
Jason?

369
00:26:31,964 --> 00:26:33,396
Hello?

370
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:42,008
Jason, what are you do...

371
00:26:55,494 --> 00:26:56,866
abby?

372
00:26:57,469 --> 00:26:59,429
I'm sorry, lana.

373
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,699
I don't know if you can even hear me, lana...

374
00:28:01,191 --> 00:28:03,460
but if you knew how much you meant to me...

375
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:07,814
well, I guess the polite thing to do is

376
00:28:08,052 --> 00:28:10,941
cough and let you know I'm standing here, but...

377
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:14,273
that always seems so forced, doesn't it?

378
00:28:17,886 --> 00:28:19,271
How is she?

379
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:22,226
Well, they don't know what's wrong with her, so it's

380
00:28:22,296 --> 00:28:23,906
it's kind a hard to say.

381
00:28:25,908 --> 00:28:27,267
Lex luthor.

382
00:28:28,121 --> 00:28:29,597
Jason teague.

383
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,586
I, uh, work at the school.
I'm the new assistant football coach.

384
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:34,846
Teague.

385
00:28:35,896 --> 00:28:38,965
As in marion, teague & weisman?

386
00:28:41,906 --> 00:28:43,614
That's my father's firm.

387
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:49,187
And you decided to get as far away
from the family business as possible.

388
00:28:49,408 --> 00:28:50,696
Smart move.

389
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:55,681
It didn't exactly go down like that.
He, uh, he cut me off.

390
00:28:56,703 --> 00:29:01,362
Well, what better place to kick-start
a new career than smallville high.

391
00:29:01,402 --> 00:29:02,497
Yeah.

392
00:29:02,973 --> 00:29:07,453
Certainly responsible of the school to send
over a representative to check in on her.

393
00:29:08,293 --> 00:29:09,904
Oh, um,

394
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,403
yeah, I just I thought I'd stop byon the way home.

395
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:14,663
It was nothing.

396
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:18,275
I doubt that.

397
00:29:30,699 --> 00:29:32,603
Lana deserves the best.

398
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:37,225
I hope you're it.

399
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:10,555
Hey.

400
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:11,969
How's she doing?

401
00:30:12,225 --> 00:30:13,597
She's pretty cut up.

402
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,554
They gave her a sedative, but she keeps saying,
"don't let him see me" over and over again.

403
00:30:18,596 --> 00:30:20,123
It's like some kind of breakdown.

404
00:30:20,168 --> 00:30:22,647
When they brought bret in,
he was acting the same way,

405
00:30:22,773 --> 00:30:26,063
but the only thing they can find in common
is a spike in their serotonin levels.

406
00:30:26,105 --> 00:30:27,537
Serotonin?

407
00:30:27,691 --> 00:30:31,178
- It's a brain chemical.
- That Isdand hallucinogens mimic.

408
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:38,353
It's also the word that lois misspelled three times
in her slander piece on extreme makeovers...

409
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:41,674
yeah, well, lana and bret are hardly
candidates for plastic surgery.

410
00:30:41,702 --> 00:30:43,662
Yeah, but abby was.

411
00:30:43,704 --> 00:30:48,353
Didn't lana say she saw bret with abby
right before he went crazy?

412
00:30:48,969 --> 00:30:52,251
Maybe this procedure made
her more beast than beauty.

413
00:30:57,768 --> 00:30:59,672
My parents don't understand.

414
00:30:59,714 --> 00:31:02,346
They say I'm too young for plastic surgery.

415
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:05,959
Well, some parents don't
remember what it was like.

416
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:09,404
When I was your age, I wasn't
exactly home coming queen.

417
00:31:09,908 --> 00:31:14,829
I worked harder than all the pretty girls,
only to watch every thing get handed to them.

418
00:31:15,795 --> 00:31:19,281
Seven surgeries in two years changed all that.

419
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:30,173
You know,I was actually interested
in that new procedure you used on abby.

420
00:31:30,272 --> 00:31:33,077
Is it really true that you only have to come in once?

421
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:35,093
That's why I developed the process.

422
00:31:35,247 --> 00:31:38,874
I didn't want to watch my daughter go
through the pain that I endured only to have

423
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,945
what other girls were lucky enough to be born with.

424
00:31:42,631 --> 00:31:45,417
So let's get you scheduled here.

425
00:31:45,473 --> 00:31:46,621
Yes please.

426
00:31:49,704 --> 00:31:51,861
You know, I'm actually running a little late.

427
00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:53,653
Are you recording this?

428
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,792
I'm going to expose you.

429
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,581
Who are you to stop people from being their best?

430
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:03,668
Call me crazy,

431
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,468
but I've always been
a firm believer that beauty...

432
00:32:06,678 --> 00:32:08,372
it's on the inside.

433
00:32:13,247 --> 00:32:17,671
The people that say that are the ones
who already have it on the outside.

434
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,364
- Okay.
- Wow.

435
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,599
- You kind a let the inner slob out, huh?
- Yeah, and her name is lois.

436
00:32:26,627 --> 00:32:31,276
She's been pulling these articles that abby's
mom published on this new breakthrough...

437
00:32:31,332 --> 00:32:35,562
instant makeover technique.
But, uh, dr. Finer an into one snag.

438
00:32:35,604 --> 00:32:39,272
It's sending the patients'serotonin levels into overdrive.

439
00:32:39,748 --> 00:32:45,701
It says here dr. Fine was working on a suppression medication
called cerethro to keep the serotonin level sin check.

440
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:47,073
Maybe it worked.

441
00:32:47,115 --> 00:32:49,733
Maybe abby was the trial run.

442
00:32:50,727 --> 00:32:55,043
Only abby'sseismic surgery
didn't come without aftershocks.

443
00:32:55,155 --> 00:33:00,168
She's passing something to people
that's super-boosting their serotonin.

444
00:33:00,224 --> 00:33:03,851
That makes sense if she kisses bret,
but what about lana?

445
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:07,062
I don't know. All I do know is
that abby's not hallucinating,

446
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:11,948
so maybe all lana and bret need
is a dose of that cerethro medication.

447
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:18,954
Looks like lois is one step ahead of us.

448
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:28,846
What are you doing?

449
00:33:28,888 --> 00:33:31,478
Giving you the inside scoop.

450
00:33:33,438 --> 00:33:36,983
You really want to know what it was like
for Abigail all of those years?

451
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:40,862
Well, you're gonna find out.

452
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:55,687
And without the suppressant
to balance out your serotonin levels,

453
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:58,418
you'll be filing your story from the psych ward.

454
00:34:34,832 --> 00:34:35,994
Clark!

455
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,330
Clark!

456
00:34:57,773 --> 00:34:59,713
- Are you okay?
- Get me out of here.

457
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,761
Okay.

458
00:35:06,774 --> 00:35:07,936
Bitch.

459
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:19,251
I don't know how to

460
00:35:19,293 --> 00:35:23,059
tell you this without sounding really stuck-up...

461
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:26,480
I already know you're stuck-up.
In fact, I wanted to talk to you about that.

462
00:35:26,522 --> 00:35:27,698
You're funny.

463
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,966
Yeah. And cute, huh?

464
00:35:32,585 --> 00:35:34,768
Okay, jason, look, I'm being serious.

465
00:35:34,992 --> 00:35:35,986
All right.

466
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:39,865
Back in freshman year, I, uh,

467
00:35:39,893 --> 00:35:42,218
made the cheerleading squad.

468
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,864
And that was my whole identity.

469
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,766
Putting on the face

470
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,202
that I thought everyone wanted to see.

471
00:35:59,165 --> 00:36:03,001
I keep thinking of all the times
that you've told me that I'm beautiful.

472
00:36:03,057 --> 00:36:05,064
And, um...

473
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,500
I can't help but wonder

474
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,454
how much of me you really see.

475
00:36:16,538 --> 00:36:19,030
Lana, I tell you you're beautiful because of

476
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:22,083
who you are, not because of what I see.

477
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:28,920
I mean, you're the girl I flew half
way across the world to be with.

478
00:36:31,258 --> 00:36:32,462
The girl who

479
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:37,368
kicks the crap out of me at xbox
and thinks it's hysterical.

480
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:43,827
I mean, I have seen you with the stomach flu where your eyes
were puffy and your nose was running, you're yakking...

481
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,376
okay, okay, I get the picture.

482
00:36:50,898 --> 00:36:52,551
All I'm saying is,

483
00:36:53,657 --> 00:36:55,393
the reasons I love you

484
00:36:58,502 --> 00:37:00,931
it's not something you can see in a mirror.

485
00:37:05,286 --> 00:37:08,553
That's good. I'm gonna write
that down and use that later.

486
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:27,362
I guess practice ran late, huh?

487
00:37:34,265 --> 00:37:36,487
Dad, I'm sorry I disappointed you.

488
00:37:37,509 --> 00:37:39,204
But I'm staying on the team.

489
00:37:42,704 --> 00:37:44,875
I'm tired of living my life on the sidelines.

490
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:47,239
I realize that, clark.

491
00:37:48,261 --> 00:37:51,412
I also realize that you're a senior in high school, and...

492
00:37:51,762 --> 00:37:54,450
from now on, you're gonna be
making a lot of your own decisions.

493
00:37:58,405 --> 00:38:00,268
But if you want to be

494
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,146
seen as an adult in this family, then you're
gonna have to start acting like one.

495
00:38:08,931 --> 00:38:11,942
Adults in this family don't run off and

496
00:38:12,026 --> 00:38:14,616
do things without discussing them first.

497
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:20,517
I know.

498
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,306
That's why I have just one question for you.

499
00:38:28,163 --> 00:38:32,072
Are you gonna let some assistant coach from
metropolis teach your boy how to play football?

500
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,916
Go deep.

501
00:38:54,924 --> 00:38:56,282
Yeah!

502
00:39:03,945 --> 00:39:06,774
SKIN DEEP

503
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,107
Admiring the genius within, huh?

504
00:39:13,163 --> 00:39:14,451
It had a typo.

505
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:16,509
Oh, nice try.

506
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:17,405
So,

507
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:19,926
I followed upon the abby story line, and

508
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:24,636
it looks like mother makeover is gonna be playing
"mirror, mirror" on the psych ward wall from now on.

509
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,444
- Is abby gonna be okay?
- Yeah, she'll be back next week.

510
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:29,605
So, are you excited for your first pep rally?

511
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,943
Not exactly the friday night
I've been dreaming of.

512
00:39:31,971 --> 00:39:35,289
Oh, come on, it's your debut
as smallville's newest celeb.

513
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:39,522
Yeah, right. One plastics 'r' us piece, and they're
gonna be holding tables all over town for me.

00:39:39,564 --> 00:39:44,535
You'd be surprised. I mean,not that I'm ceding my
stance on a woman's right to choose rhinoplasty, but...

515
00:39:44,647 --> 00:39:46,550
you've got fan mail.

516
00:39:46,606 --> 00:39:49,351
Looks like your little exposé struck a couple chords.

517
00:39:49,407 --> 00:39:52,515
I didn't even expect anybody
to read this, let alone have A..

518
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:55,054
"life-changing experience"?

519
00:39:55,082 --> 00:39:55,922
Please.

520
00:39:55,964 --> 00:40:00,011
Whatever. Say what you want,
but I know inside it's getting to you.

521
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:02,559
Welcome to the bull pen, miss lane.

522
00:40:02,773 --> 00:40:07,198
I'm off to see clark kent
in a wet t-shirt. Care to join me?

523
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,194
It's something I've never seen before.

524
00:40:20,304 --> 00:40:22,601
Keep your eye on the target.

525
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,989
Come on, lois, didn't those guys
on the base teach you anything?

526
00:40:26,311 --> 00:40:27,851
Wouldn't you like to know?

527
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:30,517
It doesn't matter, 'cause you are going down.

528
00:40:30,545 --> 00:40:31,777
That'll be the day

529
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:34,843
Kent!Kent! Kent! Kent!

530
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:43,394
Whoooo! Yeah!
