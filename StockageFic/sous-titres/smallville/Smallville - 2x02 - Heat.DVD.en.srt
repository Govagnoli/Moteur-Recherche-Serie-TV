1
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:08,265
Well, Whitney,
you shipped out over there.

2
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:10,534
I'm sure it's pretty warm.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,200
That really sucked.

4
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,939
It's okay, Clark, just say what you feel.

5
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:16,943
What's with Clark Kent,
movie star?

6
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,381
Lana's making a video-letter
for Whitney overseas.

7
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,783
Thought it was the least I could do.
Hey, do you wanna give it a shot?

8
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,786
Watch how the pros do it.

9
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:29,024
The town's still rebuilding after the storm.
The first week of school's a bear.

10
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,425
You're missing the worst heat wave
in 25 years.

11
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,998
Bottom line, stay safe and come home soon.

12
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:37,603
P.S. The football team's toast
without Fordman on offense.

13
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,738
- That was perfect, Pete.
- Yeah, super.

14
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,865
Try not to choke this time.

15
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,875
How about it, Clark?
Wanna try take two?

16
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,309
How about a rain check?

17
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:51,075
Sure. Why don't you come by
the Talon later.

18
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,685
- All right.
- All right, see you.

19
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,287
- It's good to see some things never change.
- Chloe.

20
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,551
- Hi.
- Hey, you're back.

21
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:07,761
Yeah. Fresh from the wilds of Metropolis
and the Daily Planet internship program.

22
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,903
Pete said you were a big hit.
I thought we had lost you for good.

23
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,562
Well, my dad decided to give
LexCorp another shot...

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,435
...so here I am,
back in the boonies.

25
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:18,634
I'm glad you're staying.
I really missed you this summer.

26
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:22,077
Yeah, I could tell by
the voluminous e-mails you sent.

27
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,148
Yeah, sorry. With the farm and...

28
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:26,547
Don't worry about it, Clark.
It's not a big deal.

29
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,812
Well, I'm really excited to hear
your stories.

30
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:32,381
Yeah, actually, you know what?
There aren't any stories.

31
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:36,427
Oh, except that I did meet this really hot
young intern from Metropolis High.

32
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:40,963
It was great. He made me forget all about
Smallville for three whole months.

33
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,037
- Oh, great.
- What?

34
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,646
Every year,
the incredibly aged Mrs. Kowalski...

35
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,476
...kicks off biology class
with an ancient sex-ed film.

36
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,481
Who told you that, your brother?

37
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,085
My dad.

38
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,783
Well, I'm sure it can't be that bad.

39
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,782
Good morning, I'm Ms. Atkins.

40
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:11,687
I'll be your new biology teacher
on health and human development.

41
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,166
I'm really sorry about
the air conditioning in here.

42
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,567
But it looks like we're gonna have
to suffer through this together.

43
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:20,933
Bring on the pain.

44
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,540
Let's get ready for a movie.

45
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:27,678
All right.
Everybody try to stay awake.

46
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:33,452
All members of the animal kingdom,
from the simplest one-celled organism...

47
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,057
...to the most complex of mammals,
engage in reproduction.

48
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:43,620
This ensures that each individual creature
can pass on its genetic information...

49
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,821
...to future generations.

50
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,993
Animals rely on a variety
of courtship methods.

51
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:56,974
This remarkable reproductive process
is set into motion by the act of copulation...

52
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:01,038
...also known as "intercourse" or "coitus."

53
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:04,308
In many species,
the females attract their mates...

54
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,783
...with chemical scents called pheromones.

55
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,982
Pheromones are used to elicit
specific behaviors...

56
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,652
...from members of the opposite sex
and are secreted by glands...

57
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:21,198
...or incorporated into other fluids,
such as perspiration.

58
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:25,696
The desired goal of all courtship behavior
in mammals is...

59
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,047
Okay, everybody, walk, do not run.
Leave your books.

60
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,848
Let's go!

61
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,481
Lex.

62
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,722
I came as soon as I heard.

63
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,796
- Hi.
- Hi.

64
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,489
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

65
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,668
Thanks to this young man right here.
Clark, come here for a second.

66
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,968
He was the only one that
kept a cool head during the entire thing.

67
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,041
He actually put the fire out.

68
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,073
Why am I not surprised?

69
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,307
Clark, once again, I'm grateful.

70
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,246
And I'm confused.

71
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,713
You're right, and I'm sorry.
I'd like you to meet Desiree Atkins.

72
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,685
My fiancee.

73
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,525
All clear, safe to go back into the building.

74
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,056
See you in class, Clark.

75
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,523
Fiancee, huh?

76
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:38,169
I didn't even know you were seeing anyone.
You sure about this?

77
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,898
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

78
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:46,039
I was gonna have this messengered,
but since you're here...

79
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,013
It's a wedding invitation for tonight.

80
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,486
I know it's short notice,
but I was hoping you'd be my best man.

81
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,886
- Lex, I don't know what to say.
- I hope you'll say yes.

82
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,660
Well, I'm surprised.

83
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,458
And honored.

84
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:10,897
Good.

85
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:15,803
Better get back to class. You never know
when the next fire may erupt.

86
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:31,251
Oh, a wedding present from your father.
So do you want me to sign this?

87
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,486
Well, if you don't,
my father could disinherit me.

88
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,959
Fine. I'll sign it.

89
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,829
But it's gonna cost you a kiss.

90
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:05,115
I really wish we didn't have to sign this
on our wedding day.

91
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,589
You're right.

92
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,994
You're the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

93
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,691
I plan on being with you
until death do us part.

94
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,834
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.

95
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,704
Tell me again your aversion
to air conditioning.

96
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,178
Two words:

97
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,041
Electric bill.

98
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,118
Hi, Clark. How was school?

99
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,752
It was different.

100
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,595
- Do we like different?
- There was a fire during biology class.

101
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,161
It's okay. Nobody was hurt.
I stopped it before it spread.

102
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:52,060
- It sounds like we should be proud of you.
- Except I think I started it.

103
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,266
Wait, you want to explain that, please?

104
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,934
I started to feel hot.
My eyes started to burn.

105
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,103
All of the sudden,
the spot I was staring at burst into flames.

106
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,748
Just by looking at it?

107
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,419
Hello. Hi, I'm Clark. I'm the kid who can
lift up tractors and see through walls.

108
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:12,080
Son, hang on just a second. What exactly
was going on when this happened?

109
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,159
We'd just met our new biology teacher
and were watching a film.

110
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,422
- An educational film?
- Sex-educational film.

111
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,128
This could get very complicated.

112
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,006
Clark, it's possible
that whatever's happened...

113
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,973
...has some sort of hormonal connection.

114
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,736
Yes.

115
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,877
Great, so I'm maturing into a fire-starter?

116
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,676
No, son, look...

117
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:43,117
We've just gotta get a handle on this thing,
like we got a handle on your other abilities.

118
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,656
Except all my other abilities
didn't involve things bursting into flames.

119
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,260
All the more reason for you
to give it some time.

120
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,329
- You'll just have to stay close to home.
- Great.

121
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,760
Then we'll figure it out.

122
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,068
I can't.

123
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,736
Why, what's this?

124
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,403
You're not gonna believe it.

125
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,018
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

126
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,408
- Hey, Chloe. Been looking all over for you.
- Hey.

127
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,376
Really? I'm not that hard to find, Clark.

128
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:46,109
Only Lex Luthor could put together
a fairy-tale wedding in less than 48 hours.

129
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,810
Look, you seemed a little distant
this morning.

130
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,218
I want to make sure everything's
okay between us.

131
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,051
Yeah, it's hunky-dory.

132
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,922
Now I know something's wrong. The only
person who says "hunky-dory" is my father.

133
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,491
Look, Clark, I guess I just let
my feelings get the better of me.

134
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,692
But, you know, we made a decision,
and I'm perfectly fine with it.

135
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,062
Me too.

136
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,700
Great.

137
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:12,743
But I still don't know how I feel about
taking Sex Ed from Mrs. Luthor.

138
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,473
- I can't believe Lex is married.
- He says he really loves her.

139
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,944
Yeah, well, love is rarely, if ever, logical.

140
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,417
Maybe they just have the right pheromones.

141
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,256
It's chemistry, Clark.
Some people have it, others don't.

142
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,034
Nice smile. Great.

143
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,569
Quit staring, Clark.
You'll burn your eyes out.

144
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,229
- I was just...
- It's all right.

145
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,671
Desiree's attractive, I understand.
Oh, and thanks again, Clark.

146
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,381
Lex, I gotta tell you,
I was a bit shell-shocked.

147
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,414
You go away on a two-week business trip.

148
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,247
Next thing I know,
my mom's finishing your wedding cake?

149
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,618
Believe me, when I left
I had no intention of falling in love.

150
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,919
I was struggling through
another endless business function...

151
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,994
...when suddenly Desiree was there.

152
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,428
She must have made
quite a first impression.

153
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:12,666
Actually, she said she'd come to save me.

154
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:17,836
I thought it was a joke too, that she was
only interested in my name or fortune.

155
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,776
But as the night wore on,
I realized she was different.

156
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,806
It just happened that fast?

157
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:30,011
You can waste your time playing it safe or
you can go for it. But at some point, Clark...

158
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,885
...you just know when something's right.

159
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:48,872
And Pete's taping all the Sharks games
for you, so you won't miss a thing...

160
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,272
...though, the way they're playing,
you might want to.

161
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,843
Anyway, I haven't forgotten what
we talked about, so don't worry.

162
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,483
Just come home soon and be safe.

163
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,982
That was great.
Thanks so much for doing this, Clark.

164
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,384
So, what did you and Whitney
talk about, anyway?

165
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,526
Oh, just that he wanted me
to keep an eye on you.

166
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,323
Not that he doesn't trust you...

167
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:19,061
It's hot. Do you want an iced coffee?
I'm gonna go make an iced coffee.

168
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:24,899
One of the perks of management,
24-hour access to the cappuccino machine.

169
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,108
So, what did you say to Whitney?

170
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:34,651
Started my message five or six times, but I
can't finish. There's so much I want to say.

171
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,521
It's not easy being in
a long-distance relationship.

172
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,423
I miss him.

173
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:46,964
And I'm worried about him,
but it's difficult putting your life on hold.

174
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,694
I'm not sure it was the wisest decision
for either of us.

175
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,635
I get his e-mails.

176
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,535
He's having a really tough time.

177
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,236
First with basic training,
now being shipped out.

178
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,107
He needs someone he can count on.

179
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:08,915
Besides, I do have you
to look out for me, don't I?

180
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,556
I know I haven't been around much
this summer. Thanks.

181
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,488
But ever since the storm,
the farm has just been a disaster.

182
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,561
Seems like we're all trying
to find our way back from that day.

183
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,765
Except for Lex.
I've never seen him so happy before.

184
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,730
It's kind of weird.

185
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,995
I'm glad I'm not the only one
who thinks that.

186
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,264
Still, you have to admit, it's romantic.

187
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,807
- Well, Lex makes it seem easy.
- Maybe it is.

188
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:36,073
Lex learned to act on his passion.
Never hold anything back.

189
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,513
I wonder if we'll ever be able
to do the same.

190
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,325
- Clark, what's wrong?
- Just not feeling so well.

191
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,171
Oh, my God, you're burning up.
Let me drive you home.

192
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:24,726
You okay?

193
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:28,264
Yeah, I'm fine. What happened?
I'm gonna call 911.

194
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,061
I'm not sure.

195
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,606
Clark?

196
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,507
- I thought you'd be in school already.
- I'm not going.

197
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,577
It happened again at the Talon.

198
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,275
What, another fire?

199
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,686
It was worse than before.

200
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:54,451
I was afraid it wasn't gonna stop. The fire
department said the fire looked suspicious.

201
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,924
- Come on.
- And they're right.

202
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,689
We both know you didn't mean
to start any of these fires.

203
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:01,025
Dad, Lana was there.
If I'd have hurt her...

204
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,758
Look, son...

205
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,998
Clark.

206
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,699
Hey, come on.

207
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,637
Clark.

208
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,504
Look at me.

209
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:19,344
Son, I think I have a pretty good idea
of what's triggering this thing.

210
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,449
All right. Rule number one:

211
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,594
Always practice away from the barn.
Come on.

212
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,987
I don't get it. I thought the point
was to stop this from happening.

213
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,931
Well, in order to find the off switch,
first we need to find the on switch, right?

214
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,433
All right.

215
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,506
Now, I want you to remember...

216
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:45,201
...exactly what you were thinking about
the first time it happened.

217
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,314
Come on.

218
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:58,245
- Dad, this might be easier if I was...
- Alone. Yeah.

219
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:59,919
Sorry.

220
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,957
Thanks.

221
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,471
Lana.

222
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:47,568
Five scarecrows, two water barrels
and our mailbox later...

223
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,166
Dad, you were right.
Once I understood what triggered the heat...

224
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,868
...I was able to control it
without thinking about...

225
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,775
...sex.

226
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,813
- You sure about that, son?
- Trust me.

227
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:03,751
Next time I have a date, I'll be able to
take her out without setting her on fire.

228
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,048
Well, that's a relief.

229
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,020
I'll be fine.

230
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,433
Hey, Clark, you in here?

231
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,576
It's a little hot in here for candles, Clark.

232
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:30,912
Mrs. Luthor.

233
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:35,813
Only at school.
The rest of the time, I prefer "Desiree."

234
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,846
I went by the house, but nobody was home.

235
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:42,653
- Then I saw the light in the loft.
- Yeah, my parents went into town.

236
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,690
Well, actually I came by to see you.

237
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,156
Really?

238
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,603
You see, most girls like older men,
but not me, I like younger guys.

239
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,834
What they lack in experience,
they make up for in passion.

240
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,345
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

241
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:07,910
I saw you staring at me
the other day in class.

242
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,849
I'm sorry, I...

243
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,091
No, it's okay.

244
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,254
I was actually flattered.

245
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:22,457
As a matter of fact, I was hoping we could
work on our student-teacher relations.

246
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,937
You're married to my best friend.

247
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,617
Wait.

248
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,190
I don't know
what you expected here tonight.

249
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,654
But Lex is my best friend.
I'm not gonna do anything to hurt him.

250
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,596
I don't know what came over me.

251
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,193
Please don't tell Lex about this, okay?

252
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,968
I am so sorry.

253
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,752
Oh, so the new Mrs. Luthor has an alias.
That's interesting.

254
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,588
You know, what would you say...

255
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:26,219
...if I told you Ms. Atkins,
a.k.a. Alison Sanders...

256
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:29,299
...showed up at my loft last night...

257
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,493
...and tried to seduce me?

258
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:36,604
I'd say you were living the voyeuristic
fantasy of every male student in this school.

259
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:40,802
Clark, she just married Lex. Why would
she possibly be interested in you?

260
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,176
Thanks.

261
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,446
Look, she was dissing Lex...

262
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,381
...saying he was the only thing
standing between her and me.

263
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,483
Okay, this is quickly going from merely
nauseating to genuinely disturbing.

264
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,183
I'm not making it up.
She has some strange hold on Lex.

265
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,918
Gee, I wonder what that could be.

266
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,697
I'm serious.
It's more than the fact that she's hot.

267
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,767
Clark, this is Lex Luthor we're talking about.

268
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:07,997
Don't you think he considered all of the
unfortunate possibilities before saying "I do"?

269
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:12,241
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
I'm gonna talk to him. Will you keep digging?

270
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:16,912
Yeah, sure. Where there's smoke,
there's fire. Excuse the aphorism.

271
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,319
Clark, I've been expecting you.

272
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,255
Really?

273
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,156
You can save the awkward silences.
Desiree told me everything.

274
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,695
Lex, I really don't know what to say.

275
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:40,295
All my life, I've had to second-guess
the intentions of others.

276
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:45,507
I'd reached the point where I started to
think friends were a luxury I couldn't afford.

277
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,112
Till I met you, Clark.

278
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,273
From the day you pulled me out of the river,
you've been the one person I could trust.

279
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,314
I'm glad you feel that way, Lex.

280
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:59,386
Maybe that's why I find your infatuation
with my wife so troubling.

281
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:00,923
My infatuation?

282
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:06,221
Lex, I don't know what she told you,
but she came on to me.

283
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,059
You expect me to believe that?

284
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:12,226
Come on, I saw the way
you looked at her the other day.

285
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:16,067
- She told me you'd been eyeing her in class.
- No, Lex, you have to see this.

286
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:20,306
Your wife's real name is Alison Sanders.
She grew up in Smallville.

287
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,640
I bet she didn't tell you that, did she?

288
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,745
No.

289
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,818
If she didn't tell the truth about that,
how can you believe...?

290
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,012
She's my wife, and I love her.

291
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,284
To be honest, I was hoping for an apology,
not more insinuations.

292
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,329
- I thought our friendship meant more to you.
- It does.

293
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,459
You can let yourself out.

294
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,710
I don't know what you're doing to Lex,
but I'm not dropping this.

295
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,956
I'm sorry, Lex,
that must have been difficult.

296
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,385
Can you explain this?

297
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,025
Clark's right, I changed my name.

298
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,033
But I changed it again yesterday to "Luthor."

299
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,177
That's all that really matters, isn't it?

300
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:31,578
I just don't understand
why you would keep this from me.

301
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,148
You know, it seems to me...

302
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,450
...that I haven't had a kiss
from my husband in...

303
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,320
...I don't know, at least six hours.

304
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,258
Desiree, we really need to discuss this.

305
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,841
Clark is part of your past.

306
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,051
Just like everyone else in this town.

307
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,085
You don't need them, Lex.

308
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,415
We don't need them.

309
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,290
Maybe you're right.

310
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,624
So remember, keep your head down.

311
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,927
I'm counting on an exclusive interview
from you when you get back.

312
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,102
- That was great, Chloe.
- Thank you.

313
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,773
Oh, and thanks for the quid pro quo.
Now I can move...

314
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:33,240
...the library-gets-a-new-paint-job spread
to page two.

315
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,647
So it must have been fun,
spending the entire summer in Metropolis.

316
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,985
Yeah, it was really nice to get away.

317
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:44,884
Sometimes a little distance can give you
a new perspective on things you've done.

318
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,284
Mistakes you've made.

319
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,592
Going to the spring formal with Clark
was not a mistake.

320
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:56,257
Yeah, it was. I let myself indulge in my
feelings for him, and I ended up getting hurt.

321
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,433
At least you were brave enough
to take the risk.

322
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,804
Oh, yeah, that's me. Cupid's cannon fodder.

323
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,569
Three months.
I thought I'd be over it by now.

324
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,648
But when I saw him in the hall,
all those feelings came back.

325
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,918
I even made up a lame story
about meeting a guy in Metropolis...

326
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,213
...to try and get a rise out of him.

327
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:22,125
Clark still really cares about you, Chloe.

328
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,628
I know.

329
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,593
But he cares about you more.

330
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,931
I don't want Clark
to come between our friendship.

331
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,466
Me neither.
So, what are we going to do about that?

332
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:38,905
Let's define ourselves by what we do,
not who we date.

333
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,508
Or don't date.

334
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,041
Cool.

335
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:45,205
Lana.

336
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,975
We need to talk.

337
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,683
I have to get some work done
at the Torch.

338
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,187
All right, see you.

339
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:56,022
I'm really glad to see you.
I just got the final insurance adjustments.

340
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:59,357
Once you countersign,
we can get started on the repairs.

341
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,558
Lex, I don't understand.

342
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:05,998
It's not complicated.

343
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,572
I've decided to invoke the buy-out clause
of our partnership agreement.

344
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:14,134
This gives me 24 hours
to vacate the premises.

345
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:18,806
That's right. I've decided to re-assess
my business relationships.

346
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,111
The Talon's no longer a good fit.

347
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:25,220
This isn't fair. The Talon has always
carried its own weight.

348
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,824
Breaking even isn't my idea
of a good business model.

349
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,358
And frankly...

350
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:33,396
...I question the judgment of a partner who
causes thousands of dollars in damage...

351
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:37,126
...while entertaining friends after hours.
- I was here with Clark.

352
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:42,365
My faith in Clark evaporated along with
my enthusiasm for the coffee-shop business.

353
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,511
Lana, what's wrong?

354
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,220
- I've just been evicted from the Talon.
- What?

355
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,217
Lex is using the fire to justify
taking back the building.

356
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,449
No, he can't do that. It wasn't your fault.

357
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,255
He knows that.
He was just looking for an excuse.

358
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,365
People warned me
about doing business with him.

359
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,400
When I saw how hard he fought
to keep the plant open...

360
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,130
...I actually thought he'd changed.

361
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,974
Lana, you brought the Talon back
from nothing. It means everything to you.

362
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,612
And this proves it was never really mine.

363
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,460
Hello, Clark.

364
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,263
Lana looked upset.
Did she tell you what happened?

365
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,632
Yeah, she mentioned that Lex
is closing the Talon, and somehow...

366
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,239
...I think it wasn't completely his decision.

367
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:50,806
Well, you're right.

368
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,376
We made the decision as a couple.

369
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,742
I wanted to prove a point.

370
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,711
To who? Lana?

371
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,016
No, Clark, to you.

372
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,621
I want you to understand something.

373
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,881
I can control the people in your life.

374
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:12,085
I had Lex close down the Talon in
a heartbeat. Imagine what would happen...

375
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:15,664
...if I turned him against this town,
your friends...

376
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,761
...or even your parents.
- I won't let you do that.

377
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,804
You want this to stop?
Then stay out of our lives.

378
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,601
I'm not gonna back off.

379
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,439
And I'll find a way to get through to Lex.

380
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,357
Clark, why didn't you tell us
about this earlier?

381
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,692
I didn't know what to say.
I guess I was embarrassed.

382
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,327
I don't know what we can do about
the Talon. It's not against the law...

383
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,906
...to talk your husband into
a bad business decision.

384
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,510
No, but trying to seduce a teenage boy is.

385
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,976
I'm calling the school board
in the morning...

386
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:38,206
...and getting this woman suspended.

387
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,617
Yeah.

388
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,451
Ethan. Come on in.

389
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,822
What brings you out here?

390
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,223
A teacher down at the high school,
Mrs. Luthor...

391
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,694
...claims she saw Clark set her car on fire.

392
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,527
That's three suspicious fires
in as many days, Clark.

393
00:28:56,701 --> 00:29:00,102
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take you
into custody until we sort this out.

394
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,034
- Mom, Dad, this is a mistake.
- We know.

395
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:05,108
Clark, I want you to do what Ethan says.

396
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,674
We'll figure this thing out, I promise.

397
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,541
Just turn around, son.

398
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,721
That's right, I'm selling the building
and everything in it.

399
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:25,329
Talk to our people in Metropolis
about a price and get back to me.

400
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,861
Mrs. Kent.

401
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,098
I was looking for Nell.

402
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:33,297
She just left.
I believe she's arranging for the movers.

403
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:36,736
- Well, I hope I didn't disturb you.
- Mrs. Kent.

404
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,638
I am truly sorry about Clark.

405
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,502
Are you, Lex?

406
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:54,284
My son is in jail,
and your wife put him there.

407
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,356
Maybe these fires were a cry for help.

408
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:59,224
Is that you talking,
or is Mrs. Luthor talking through you?

409
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:01,797
I'd never ask you to take sides
against your husband.

410
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,695
Please don't ask me to doubt my wife.

411
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:08,532
Any good relationship relies on trust,
but there has to be room to disagree.

412
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:10,936
Like the way Jonathan and I
disagreed about you.

413
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,071
He couldn't see past the Luthor name.

414
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:16,008
I always thought
you were truly trying to be Clark's friend.

415
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,581
I'm beginning to think Jonathan
was right all along.

416
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,150
Believe me,
I never wanted it to come to this.

417
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,876
You know Clark.

418
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,681
He's not a criminal.

419
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:28,586
He's the one person
who's stood by you no matter what.

420
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:31,591
Ask yourself,
is he really capable of this?

421
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,760
I wouldn't have thought so.

422
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:36,594
- But I know Desiree.
- Lex...

423
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,794
...you met and married her in a week.

424
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,131
How well could you know her?

425
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,672
Mrs...

426
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,602
Oh, hello, Mr. Kent.

427
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:20,705
- Are you here to talk about Clark?
- Yes, I am.

428
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,610
And I would prefer to do it fully clothed,
if you don't mind.

429
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:26,948
Sure.

430
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,019
I'm sorry about your son...

431
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,418
...Mr. Kent.

432
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,695
But you should take this as a warning sign.

433
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,354
Your son is a seriously troubled
young man.

434
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,124
And just how do you figure that?

435
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,031
Isn't it obvious?

436
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,535
He starts fires, then he takes credit
for putting them out.

437
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,700
He told me that he was nowhere
near your car, and I believe him.

438
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,447
Your son is lying to you.
I'm sorry.

439
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,749
You know, I thought I could come out here
and reason with you.

440
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,046
But clearly I was mistaken.

441
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,986
Mr. Kent, wait.

442
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,386
Please, I'm sorry.

443
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,094
You're right about everything.

444
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,897
This all has to do with Lex.

445
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,931
This has got nothing to do
with your husband, Lex Luthor.

446
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:33,079
I need you to do something for me first.

447
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,523
Sorry we didn't have time
to bake a file into a cake.

448
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:42,990
How are you holding up?

449
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,493
Besides being accused of
being a serial arsonist...

450
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:48,860
...and trying to sleep with
my best friend's wife, I'm great.

451
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:52,293
We've got good news. Chloe followed up
on your Alison Sanders clue.

452
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,267
Apparently our vixen known as Alison...

453
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:57,135
...was popular with the Smallville boys
even as a teenager.

454
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,469
She was with her boyfriend
when the meteors hit.

455
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,580
The Ledger article doesn't say, but let your
mind wander as to what they were doing.

456
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:07,377
Few weeks later, he lost it and murdered
her parents. She inherited everything.

457
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,952
Fast-forward five years.
Desiree is now a teacher.

458
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,715
She marries a wealthy executive,
only to see him offed...

459
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,120
...by one of her moonstruck
high-school students.

460
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:18,751
- Same confession and denial six hours later.
- The classic black-widow scenario.

461
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,694
Only, after murder two,
this black widow had the misfortune...

462
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,731
...of being heavily invested in dot-coms.

463
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:26,369
After she lost the money,
she decided to go after Lex.

464
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,801
So she tried to seduce me to kill him.

465
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,600
Well, why'd she think I'd do it?

466
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:33,038
- Pheromones.
- Chloe.

467
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:36,703
Clark, she was in the throes
of major passion when the meteors hit.

468
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:41,147
If her pheromone levels were enhanced, she
could get a guy to do whatever she wants.

469
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,579
Lucky for us,
Clark Kent seems to be immune...

470
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:46,189
...to some members of the opposite sex.

471
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,861
Time's up, girls.

472
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,427
Okay.

473
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,536
Hey, my dad went to go see Desiree.
I gotta get out of here.

474
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,102
Just hang on, okay?

475
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,785
Hold it.

476
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,263
We've gotta get you out of here, Clark.

477
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,026
Stay close to me.

478
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:34,899
Clark!

479
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,079
We need to talk.

480
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:48,508
Is something wrong?

481
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,586
I'm not sure.

482
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:54,750
I know love is supposed to be blind...

483
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:59,659
...but since meeting you, I feel like I've lost
all sense of reason regarding my friends...

484
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,322
...my business,
and suddenly I don't know why.

485
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,429
Well, it's too late for second thoughts, Lex.
The papers have been finalized.

486
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,401
Everything you have is mine.

487
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:12,569
You only inherit in the event of my death.

488
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:19,610
Are you planning to kill me?

489
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:21,948
No.

490
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,156
He is.

491
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,462
I know you, Mr. Kent.

492
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,237
You're not a murderer. Please...

493
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,236
...put the gun down.

494
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,811
I'm not letting you add Desiree's name
to your list of victims.

495
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,710
She's using you. Whatever she told you,
it's not true.

496
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,151
Dad, don't!

497
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,477
- Dad, you can't do this.
- Clark!

498
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,823
Dad, you okay?

499
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,270
God!

500
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,209
Thanks, Clark.

501
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:30,875
It's good to have you back.

502
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,516
Well, it's nice to see something
other than jail food.

503
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:37,745
Well, I just got off the phone with Ethan.
After Lex's statement, the arson...

504
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,413
The arson charges have been dropped.

505
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,560
And from what Ethan said,
I think we've seen the last of Desiree.

506
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:45,692
What about my escape?

507
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:49,229
Considering your age and the fact
that you did save Lex Luthor's life...

508
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,096
...they're willing to let you off
with a stern warning.

509
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,735
We're very lucky this time, son.

510
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,369
Did Lex say anything about what happened?

511
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:04,007
I think we'd both like
to put that way behind us.

512
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:08,150
And now, Mrs. Kent,
if you are finished here...

513
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,287
...I would like to take you out to dinner.

514
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,285
Solo, if you don't mind, Clark.

515
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,450
I don't mind.

516
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,169
Clark.

517
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,307
I was hoping I'd find you.

518
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,000
Hey, Lex. How you feeling?

519
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:37,343
Like I'm waking up from a bad dream.

520
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:41,342
- You really loved her, didn't you?
- I thought I did.

521
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:47,586
I filed for an annulment, which my lawyers
tell me should be final in a couple days.

522
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:50,283
I'll let the police deal with Desiree.

523
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:54,056
- And when that's finished?
- I'll try to be more cautious.

524
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,331
I let my passion get the best of me.

525
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,469
I won't make that mistake again.

526
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:04,765
Lex, I don't think having passion
is such a bad thing.

527
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,500
You're right, Clark.

528
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,544
Passion for life and work
and friends is great.

529
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:12,182
As long as you keep it in check.

530
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,551
I should take a page out of your book.

531
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:16,314
How do you mean?

532
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,348
The way you deal with Lana.

533
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,854
I've always told you to go for it,
but you don't...

534
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,493
...even now that the quarterback's
out of the picture.

535
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,595
I want to, believe me.

536
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:29,494
But Lana needs to work out her feelings
for Whitney first.

537
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,498
I can wait.

538
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,364
Don't wait too long.

539
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:44,674
Hi, Whitney. I've been trying to get
this done, but it's been a crazy week.

540
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,483
Still, in a way, I'm glad...

541
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:51,917
...because it's given me the chance
to think about what I need to say.

542
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:03,991
- Hey, Clark.
- Hi, Lana.

543
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:07,228
- Thought I'd help with the repairs.
- Thanks.

544
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,499
Good news is, I think we're
almost ready for our grand reopening.

545
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,335
What's the bad news?

546
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,377
I still can't figure out how to use
the new espresso machine.

547
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,544
Looks very...

548
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,615
...Italian.
- It's a gift from Lex.

549
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:23,013
Along with roses and an offer to rework
our partnership agreement...

550
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,553
...so that this could never happen again.

551
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,283
Lex told me what happened
with Ms. Atkins and your dad.

552
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,720
It's lucky you were there.

553
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:35,520
It's funny how she managed
to seduce everyone but you.

554
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,697
Yeah, I guess she just wasn't my type.

555
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,539
And the jailhouse,
how did you manage your escape?

556
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:46,406
There was a fire. The sheriff opened
the door. I just made a run for it.

557
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,746
Three fires. You were there all three times.

558
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:53,511
Weird coincidence, huh?

559
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,212
Or just part of the mystery
that is Clark Kent.

560
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:03,385
How's it going with the tape
for Whitney?

561
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,626
I decided to tell him how I really feel.

562
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,930
What happened to putting on a brave face?

563
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:15,136
Wasn't fair to either of us.
I haven't been honest about my feelings.

564
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,674
I know it's gonna hurt,
and my timing is crummy...

565
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:24,804
...but having a relationship that's built
on secrets and lies is doomed to fail.

566
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:31,981
Don't you think so, Clark?

567
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,021
Absolutely.

568
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:41,896
Looks like the heat wave's
finally broken. I'm glad.

569
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,694
Yeah, me too.

570
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,230
I should let you finish.

571
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,904
Bye, Lana.

572
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,140
Bye.

573
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,703
Whitney.

574
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,635
I care about you very much.

575
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:26,207
And I always will.

576
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:31,209
But we promised that
we'd be honest with each other.

577
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,316
And the truth is...

578
00:42:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
