1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,360
Now, I'm gonna knock on the other wall.
When you hear me, knock on this wall.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,160
What is she, crazy? Hey, get that candle
and get your butt out of there!

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,680
- I don't think she can hear you, Pete.
- Guys, hit the mute button, okay?

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,360
Lance! Oh, Lance!

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,320
Oh, I saw it again!

6
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,400
Hello?

7
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,200
Who's there?

8
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,360
- Would you like some tea?
- Yes, please.

9
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,520
- I've got an elephant. What do you have?
- Rhinoceros.

10
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,520
Would you like an apple?

11
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,280
Good.

12
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,040
Lana? I got a hippopotamus.

13
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,080
You're so big.

14
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,520
Why are you scared?

15
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,760
Do you want to play with me?

16
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,680
Lana, what's going on?

17
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,280
I thought I...

18
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,040
I guess... The lights went out, and...

19
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,600
I guess the movie creeped me out.
I thought I saw...

20
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,840
Thought you saw what?

21
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,880
- Nothing.
- Let's get out of the dark.

22
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,440
You sure you're okay?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

23
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,680
That's my favorite dress.

24
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,280
You're... You're not real.

25
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,640
- I am too real.
- No, you died.

26
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,880
Lana? Chloe's dad said
you were up here.

27
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,680
Lana, what is it?

28
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,320
Clark.

29
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,720
It sounds so ridiculous.

30
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,360
You can tell me anything, Lana.
You know that.

31
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,760
Clark, do you believe in ghosts?

32
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,040
We used to come out here all the time.
We'd make little boats...

33
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,960
...out of flowers
and float them downstream.

34
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,960
They always sunk
before they got around the bend.

35
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,200
Is this where she drowned?

36
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,560
It was raining...

37
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,960
...and the bridge was slippery.

38
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,360
The next thing I knew...

39
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,400
It's okay.

40
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,400
Okay.

41
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,960
Funny thing is...

42
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,920
...Emily always believed in ghosts.

43
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,160
Whenever a candle flickered
or a curtain rustled...

44
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,080
...she'd insist it was my mom
trying to talk to me.

45
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,840
As much as I wanted to believe her,
I always knew it was make-believe.

46
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,880
Maybe this is her way of showing me
that the dead can communicate with us.

47
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,840
If she is a ghost, why do you think
she waited so long to contact you?

48
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,160
I don't know.

49
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,120
There's just gotta be
a rational explanation for this girl.

50
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,600
Have you kept in contact
with her parents?

51
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,720
No, they split up after the accident.

52
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,040
I don't know where her mom is,
but her dad moved to Grandville.

53
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,560
Maybe you're not the only one
who's seen her.

54
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,880
Didn't you see
the "No Trespassing" signs?

55
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,040
Mr. Dinsmore, it's me, Lana Lang.

56
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,600
Oh, well, look at you. All grown up.

57
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,760
Mr. Dinsmore, this is...
This is going to sound strange...

58
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,480
...but I think I saw Emily.

59
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,960
What is this, some kind of sick joke?

60
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,800
I don't mean to upset you. It's just...

61
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,320
...I've seen her twice.

62
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,920
We figured if anybody else had seen her,
it'd be you.

63
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,320
Sure, I've seen her...

64
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,800
Whenever I hear her favorite song...

65
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,240
...or see a young girl jumping rope
in the park.

66
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,200
Losing a child is something
a parent never gets over.

67
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,840
Now, if you'll excuse me.

68
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,720
Mr. Luthor, I would think quick
decision-making would be your forte.

69
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,560
That's why I made the quick decision
to put Helen in charge of the wedding.

70
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,160
Well, I don't see her here, and
we're three weeks away and counting.

71
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,720
- Hello.
- I knew you had your vices, son...

72
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,080
...but I didn't realize gluttony
was one of them.

73
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,400
Oh, I suppose if there's anyone who's
an authority on the seven deadly sins...

74
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,280
...it's you, Dad.

75
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,640
Amaretto truffle.

76
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,440
Could I have some water, please?

77
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,800
The liqueur seems to be overpowering
the butter.

78
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,320
Thank you.

79
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,800
As much as I value
your epicurean input, Dad...

80
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,960
...I'm curious, why are you in Smallville?

81
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,600
I wanted to give you my gift in person...

82
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,280
...since it's obvious by now that I won't
be receiving a wedding invitation.

83
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,800
You offered the woman I love
$ 100,000 to leave me.

84
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,440
I did you a favor, Lex.

85
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,840
That was the ultimate test of loyalty.

86
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,920
And she passed with flying colors.
You should be thanking me.

87
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,400
Thanking you? Well, my thank-you note
must be lost in the mail...

88
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,520
...along with your invitation.

89
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,440
Go on, open it.

90
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,120
- A Caribbean honeymoon.
- Your own private island.

91
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,680
I'll throw in the LuthorCorp jet as well.

92
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,720
Why?

93
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,840
I just want you to be happy, Lex.

94
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,520
Clark, when you turned in
your press pass...

95
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,280
...you relinquished
all of your computer privileges.

96
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,160
I don't mean to be hall monitor,
but it is school policy.

97
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,440
- I'm trying to help Lana.
- Of course you are.

98
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,480
What are you saving her from today?

99
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,120
She's being haunted by a girl
who died six years ago.

100
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,200
Okay, I'm piqued. Go on.

101
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,240
She thinks it's a ghost.
I'm not so sure.

102
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,560
It's not like people haven't
come back to life around here.

103
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,560
Even though it goes against my natural
slant toward all things Wall of Weird...

104
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,280
...I think there's another explanation
for this.

105
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,480
Lana's been through a lot in her life.

106
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,600
Maybe this haunting is a way she's
dealing with it through her subconscious.

107
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,160
You think she's seeing things
that aren't there?

108
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,240
No, I think to her they're very real.

109
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,040
- She's not crazy.
- I wasn't saying she's crazy.

110
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,680
All I'm saying is, there's a lot of things
about Lana that you don't know.

111
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,000
I mean, you don't hear her crying
in her room at 3:00 in the morning.

112
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,280
What you see is just a mask.

113
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,040
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because she talks to you.

114
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,400
Regardless of what's going on
between us, she's still my friend.

115
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,600
Chloe.

116
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,360
Thanks.

117
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,200
Lock up when you're done.

118
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,120
Sweetheart, I've been looking
all over for you.

119
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,960
- Everything's different.
- What do you mean?

120
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,120
Where are all the bunnies?

121
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,640
Honey, we can talk about that
when we get home. Okay?

122
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,960
This is our home, Daddy.

123
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,640
No, not anymore, sweetheart.
Our home's in Grandville.

124
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,520
I don't understand.

125
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,480
Lana said I died.

126
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,640
Lana doesn't know
what she's talking about.

127
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,840
Yes, she does.
She's my best friend.

128
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,160
Emily...

129
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,120
...get in the car.

130
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,280
No.

131
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,240
I'm not going.
I don't want to be locked up anymore.

132
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,680
I want to be a normal girl.
I want to play with Lana.

133
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,160
You have to listen to me, Emily.

134
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,960
You are never to see Lana Lang again.

135
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,520
- Do you understand?
- You can't tell me what to do.

136
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,000
I'll do whatever I want.

137
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,880
Clark, couldn't the boneyard visit
have waited till after the rain stopped?

138
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,880
It's the only way to disprove
the zombie theory.

139
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,560
Yeah, well, if this Emily girl
really is a ghost...

140
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,320
...I really don't think she'd appreciate
you scoping out her coffin.

141
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,640
Pete, here it is.

142
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,720
"Emily Eve Dinsmore.

143
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,800
Loving child, blessed angel."

144
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,880
The body hasn't been touched.

145
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,120
Where did she go...?

146
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,720
Clark?

147
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,800
Let me in, Lana.

148
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,520
I know why you're scared of me.

149
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,320
I saw my grave.

150
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,560
But I'm not dead, Lana.

151
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,120
Who are you?

152
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,960
I'm Emily, silly.

153
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,080
- What do you want from me?
- My daddy said I can't see you anymore.

154
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,440
Did you do something bad?

155
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,440
Lana.

156
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,600
She's here.

157
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,400
Where?

158
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,520
- I swear it, Clark, she was right here.
- Lana, it's okay, I believe you.

159
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,320
Emily's not a ghost. I saw her.

160
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,680
In the graveyard. It's where I found this.

161
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,880
Her father gave it to her because
she wanted a necklace like mine.

162
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,160
But it can't be Emily.
She couldn't still be 10 years old.

163
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,720
I don't know who it is.

164
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,400
But I think I know how she's able
to just appear out of nowhere.

165
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,760
I think she moves faster
than we can see her.

166
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,600
- How?
- I'm not sure, but... Hey...

167
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,360
...at least we know you're not
losing your mind.

168
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,800
Thanks, Clark.

169
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,400
Back from Metropolis so soon?

170
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,280
Awfully long drive
for quality health care.

171
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,840
You tailing me, Lex? I hope not.

172
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,800
- A bit obsessive, don't you think?
- I heard you were here.

173
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,880
- I wanted to make sure you were okay.
- I came to visit a former employee.

174
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,840
He's just been admitted.
Unfortunately, he's still unconscious.

175
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,240
He must have been an exceptional
worker to merit a visit from the CEO.

176
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,760
I like to think that I treat everyone
at LuthorCorp as part of the family.

177
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,800
Oh, that would explain
their lack of loyalty.

178
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,000
Have you become so cynical that you
read ill will into my good intentions?

179
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,280
I'm just wondering why you're spending
so much time in Smallville lately.

180
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,720
You may not believe me,
I'm sure you won't...

181
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,840
...but I've always tried
to be a good father to you, son.

182
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,320
I worry about you. Son, these obsessive,
paranoid tendencies...

183
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,400
The danger with indulging them
is that you lose perspective.

184
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,000
And you turn your back
on what truly matters.

185
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,280
Lex? Coming?

186
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,360
He's sleeping.

187
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,960
I tried to wake him up.

188
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,800
He needs to take care of me.

189
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,560
I have nowhere to go.

190
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,160
- What's your name?
- Emily. He's my daddy.

191
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,160
I think our daddies are friends.
Mine was just in here.

192
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,640
He's a bad man.

193
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,600
- Did he do something to your daddy?
- He took the bunnies away.

194
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,080
- What bunnies, Emily?
- The ones in the back yard.

195
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,600
Maybe I should talk to your mommy.

196
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,160
Is she here?

197
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,840
Come on, stay close.

198
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,200
You're my best friend.

199
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,960
You're my best friend.

200
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,800
You're my best friend.

201
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,560
This must be what you saw
at the Talon.

202
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,320
You're my best friend.

203
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,200
You're my best friend.

204
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,640
You're my best friend.

205
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,560
Who needs human companionship when
you could have a Gabby Abby?

206
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,000
I remember this.

207
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,080
I gave it to Emily for her ninth birthday.

208
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:10,120
Last entry's from the day before she
died: "I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow.

209
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,800
Lana and I are going to the river.
We're going to be best friends forever."

210
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,440
Lana.

211
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,320
Oh, my God.

212
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,080
- Clark, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

213
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,520
Let's get out of here.

214
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,200
You did the right thing,
calling the police.

215
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,640
- He was trying to clone his daughter?
- More than try. We think he succeeded.

216
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,120
Whoever's funding him's
sure got a lot of money.

217
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,120
Dinsmore even wanted her to have
the same memories as Emily.

218
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,440
- That's why he gave her the diary.
- That little girl must be so confused.

219
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,120
All she wanted was a friend,
and I just scared her away.

220
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,520
- I have to go and find her.
- Lana, I don't think that's a good idea.

221
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,280
Clark's right. Until we know more,
why don't you stay here?

222
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,920
- Mrs. Kent, Mr. Kent.
- Hello, sheriff.

223
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,400
- We followed up on your story.
- You found the lab.

224
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,160
After we got your call,
we went and checked it out.

225
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,880
David Copperfield must've got
there first.

226
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,640
I saw them.

227
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,040
The people who took everything away?

228
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,240
The sleeping girls.

229
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,160
Why are they like me?

230
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,040
- Emily...
- My daddy said I can't remember...

231
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,760
...because I had an accident.

232
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,200
You don't remember anything
because you didn't write that.

233
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,480
A different Emily did.

234
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,560
She's the girl buried in the graveyard,
isn't she?

235
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,760
Yeah.

236
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,040
This is her story.

237
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,160
But you have to write your own.

238
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,280
Why would my daddy lie to me?

239
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,080
He probably thought that telling you
the truth would make you feel different.

240
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,560
But there's nothing wrong
with being different.

241
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,120
I'm different too.
It doesn't change who we are.

242
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,320
Yes, it does.

243
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,040
Lex, what are you doing here?

244
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,880
I could ask the same of you.

245
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,320
I met Emily Dinsmore.

246
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,720
You can't blame me
for being a little intrigued...

247
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,720
...after I found out she died
six years ago.

248
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,920
So you don't know anything
about the lab that was down here?

249
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,680
They cloned Emily here. That's why
your father's been refining meteor rocks.

250
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,680
- What?
- There were jars of it.

251
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,680
Right where you're standing.

252
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,640
Before Dinsmore left LuthorCorp,
he was developing a technique...

253
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,920
...to speed up cell growth.

254
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,080
He claimed he could incubate a rabbit
embryo to adulthood in a matter of days.

255
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,360
He's been using the meteor rocks
as Miracle-Gro.

256
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,160
That's why Emily looks like
she's 10 years old already.

257
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,040
All ethics aside,
it's an astonishing accomplishment.

258
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,680
Well, tell that to the little girl
who doesn't know who she is.

259
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,000
I brought you a picture.

260
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,680
Thanks.

261
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,800
Emily, I want to talk to you.

262
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,160
Are you ready to go to the river?

263
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,920
Not today.

264
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,680
- Don't you want to be friends anymore?
- Of course I do, but...

265
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,040
Come to the river. I'll race you.
I want everything to be like before.

266
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,400
No! Emily, wait.

267
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,480
You're here about Emily, aren't you?

268
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,600
She's a remarkable girl.

269
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,560
- Did he find her?
- Not yet.

270
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,120
But, knowing my father, he will.

271
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,240
You know that Emily
will never be safe in his care.

272
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,160
- I don't have many options.
- I'm offering to protect her.

273
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,520
You loved her enough to create her.

274
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,800
Don't you want her to have
a normal life?

275
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,280
Of course I do.
But Emily's accelerated growth caused...

276
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,200
...severe chromosomal damage.

277
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,240
She has no conscience,
she has no concept of right or wrong.

278
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,200
She's dangerous.

279
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,480
Lana?

280
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,720
- Clark, what's wrong?
- Where's Lana?

281
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,800
I thought she was in the living room
doing her homework.

282
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,400
Emily, it's too slippery out here.

283
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,360
- It's okay, Lana, we won't get in trouble.
- You don't understand.

284
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,040
We've already been out here
once before.

285
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,920
Is that why Daddy's mad at you?

286
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,640
It was raining...

287
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,720
...and I fell into the water
and you jumped in after me.

288
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,120
- Because I'm your best friend?
- Yes.

289
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,720
You kept swimming beside me,
telling me I could make it...

290
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,600
...that I'd be fine.

291
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,960
And when I looked back,
you were too far away...

292
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,520
...and the current was too strong.

293
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,040
Didn't you save me?

294
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,960
No.

295
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,920
I thought you were my best friend.

296
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,760
If I could go back and change that day,
I swear to you, I would.

297
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,040
I live every day knowing
that it should have been me.

298
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,720
This time it will be.

299
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,680
Lana.

300
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,120
Lana.

301
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,800
Oh, please.

302
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,640
Lana.

303
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,640
Lana, it's okay.

304
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,120
It's okay, it's me. It's all right.
You're okay.

305
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,480
Clark. Hold me.

306
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,520
Lex, what's the crisis? One minute,
you want nothing to do with me...

307
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,240
...and then I'm inundated
with urgent messages.

308
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,080
How does it feel to play God, Dad?

309
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,720
If I left in the middle of brunch
with the governor...

310
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,920
I know you've reopened Level 3.

311
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,680
The ominous Level 3.

312
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,280
Instead of abandoning the project
like you claimed...

313
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,280
...you dispersed the research
into smaller, undetectable labs.

314
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,280
How could you buy in to such a myth?

315
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,480
Your connection to Dinsmore
is more than a myth.

316
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,600
You're genetically
engineering human beings.

317
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,160
Oh, Lex. Lex.

318
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,800
Extraterrestrials. Secret labs.

319
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,280
It's science fiction, son.

320
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,280
I saw Emily Dinsmore with my own eyes.

321
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,240
If you'd kept your mind on business,
you might have noticed that the state...

322
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,800
...has placed the conservatorship of
the Kawatche cave under my control...

323
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,880
...effective today.

324
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,440
That's impossible.

325
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,720
- I was under contract for five years.
- That's what I told the governor.

326
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,440
But, apparently, somehow,
he's learned of a series of accidents...

327
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,360
...and several unfortunate deaths
that occurred under your watch.

328
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,920
I'm sorry, son.

329
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,680
I've tried to teach you:
Always keep a sharp eye on the ball.

330
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,560
- Smooth as silk. Good job, Dad.
- Thanks.

331
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,640
You realize, Clark,
this baby is gonna be one lucky kid...

332
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,880
...having you as an older brother.

333
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,360
I mean that, Clark.

334
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,520
Just a... Just a second.

335
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,880
Lana.

336
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,240
Hi.

337
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,040
Lana, I heard Sheriff Adams
is still looking for Emily.

338
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,160
But I'm concerned about you.
Are you doing okay?

339
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,080
I'm gonna be fine. Just worried about
Emily, after all she's been through.

340
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,680
- Yeah.
- I hope the police find her soon.

341
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,560
I'm sure they will.

342
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,560
Do you think I could borrow Clark
for a couple of minutes, Mr. Kent?

343
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,000
Yeah, I don't see why not.

344
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,960
If this is the mysterious Lana, I like it.

345
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,240
What is this all about?

346
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,280
Us, kind of.

347
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,520
I just wanted to thank you for yesterday.

348
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,000
There were a few minutes there
when I really thought I might be losing it.

349
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,480
But you never doubted me.

350
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,640
Not for a second.

351
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,280
You always believe in me.

352
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,280
It means a lot.

353
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,600
Lana, what is this all about?

354
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,560
It's just that sometimes I...

355
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,960
I feel like you've created
this perfect picture of who I am.

356
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,040
That's what I see.

357
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,320
This might sound silly.

358
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,840
But I have this fear that...

359
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,760
That one day you'll finally get
a good look at me and...

360
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,320
I'm going to disappoint you.

361
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,320
That you'll see that I'm not as strong...

362
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,640
...or as good as you think I am.

363
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,440
And I'm afraid that it'll change the way
you feel about me.

364
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,800
Nothing could ever do that.

365
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,280
Maybe it's me that needs
to start believing in you.

366
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,080
We'll do better next time.

367
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,640
I assume this means
I can continue the project.

368
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,120
I don't think that would be
a wise decision, Pete.

369
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,240
You've jeopardized the research
once already.

370
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,920
- You said you wanted a prototype.
- Yes, I did.

371
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,960
And this phase has
brought us closer to our goal.

372
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,840
But I don't want you working
on the project any longer.

373
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:08,240
- You're too emotionally involved.
- She's flawed...

374
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,680
...but she's my daughter.
- No. No, she's not.

375
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,480
She's a poor approximation.

376
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,640
This specimen is defective.

377
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,760
You can't take her away from me.

378
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,440
She's...

379
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,560
...my life.

380
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,040
She's the property of LuthorCorp.

381
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,240
Hello, Emily.

382
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,480
I don't like you.

383
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,200
You know what I think, Emily?
I think...

384
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,760
I think we just got off
on the wrong foot.

385
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,880
Look at this.

386
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,640
You want to hold him, Emily?
Go ahead.

387
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,120
Where's my daddy?

388
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,400
You mustn't worry about him, Emily.

389
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,040
I'm gonna take very good care of you.
You'll see.

390
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,200
What do you think
you should call your rabbit?

391
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:20,440
- Bunny Buns.
- Bunny Buns? That's a beautiful name.

392
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,600
This tastes good.
May I have some more?
