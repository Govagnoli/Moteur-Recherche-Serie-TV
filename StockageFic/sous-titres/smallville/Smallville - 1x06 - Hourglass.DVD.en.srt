1
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:10,995
<i>We need an orderly to room 206.
Orderly please to room 206.</i>

2
00:00:11,172 --> 00:00:13,663
Man, I don't know how
I let you talk me into this.

3
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:16,708
Every student needs to complete
30 hours of community service.

4
00:00:16,878 --> 00:00:19,642
Yeah. But we could have served
our community by lifeguarding...

5
00:00:19,814 --> 00:00:23,045
...a girls' swim class instead of
hanging out with the denture crowd.

6
00:00:23,217 --> 00:00:24,809
I mean, what's the attraction?

7
00:00:27,588 --> 00:00:29,556
Hi, Clark, Pete.

8
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:31,851
Lana, I didn't know
you were volunteering here.

9
00:00:32,026 --> 00:00:33,755
-Yeah, right.
-For a couple of weeks now.

10
00:00:33,928 --> 00:00:36,863
-You part of the companion program?
-I'm reading with Cassandra.

11
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:40,865
She's an interesting woman. Some of
the nurses say she can see the future.

12
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:02,487
It takes two of you
to read to me now, does it?

13
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:05,353
Don't just stand there, come in.

14
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:11,120
-How'd you know there were two of us?
-Well, I'm blind, not deaf.

15
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,895
I heard your little friend's shoes
squeaking all the way down the hall.

16
00:01:16,104 --> 00:01:18,902
Can you really tell the future?

17
00:01:19,607 --> 00:01:22,599
-Way to go, Pete, real subtle.
-What's your name?

18
00:01:23,144 --> 00:01:27,604
-Pete Ross.
-Mr. Ross, if you want your fortune told...

19
00:01:27,782 --> 00:01:29,215
...go to the circus.

20
00:01:38,092 --> 00:01:43,155
It's a long walk home, Mr. Ross.
Check your pockets.

21
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:51,229
Oh, man. I locked my keys in the car.

22
00:01:51,873 --> 00:01:54,205
Dude, you're on your own.

23
00:01:56,377 --> 00:01:59,972
Now, what's your name?

24
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:07,179
Mr. Bollston? It's Lana Lang.

25
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:19,822
Lang.

26
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:26,204
The Langs moved to Smallville in 1938...

27
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:31,210
...took over a couple of Dust Bowl farms.
Knew a bargain when they saw it.

28
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:35,212
-You're a local-history buff.
-It's kind of my obsession.

29
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,481
So....

30
00:02:38,186 --> 00:02:40,279
Are you my next victim?

31
00:02:40,488 --> 00:02:43,013
You don't look that scary to me.

32
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:47,155
You should have known me
in my younger days.

33
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:50,454
I'm sure you were quite the heartbreaker.

34
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:53,361
How about a spin around the grounds
and you can tell me...

35
00:02:53,534 --> 00:02:56,526
...what the Langs have been doing
since 1938.

36
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:03,839
It's so beautiful. I don't know why
more people don't come out here.

37
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:07,003
They're too busy watching television.

38
00:03:07,281 --> 00:03:12,344
Say, would you mind running back
to my room and getting me a scarf?

39
00:03:12,553 --> 00:03:15,488
-I don't want to catch a chill.
-Sure.

40
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,056
Honey, you're a doll.

41
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:46,309
Water, please.

42
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:33,930
What's wrong?

43
00:04:37,104 --> 00:04:39,504
Someone close to you is going to die.

44
00:04:41,342 --> 00:04:42,934
Very soon.

45
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:52,869
When you need this kind of stuff done,
ask me. That's why I'm here.

46
00:05:53,247 --> 00:05:57,183
-Something bothering you, Clark?
-I think we should start putting safety first.

47
00:05:57,351 --> 00:05:59,512
If you haven't noticed,
this stuff is dangerous.

48
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:03,714
Yeah, well, this is a farm.
It kind of goes along with the territory.

49
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:05,518
Seriously, son, what's going on?

50
00:06:07,194 --> 00:06:09,526
At the retirement center
I met this old, blind lady.

51
00:06:09,697 --> 00:06:12,029
I know it sounds crazy,
but she can see the future.

52
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,592
What did she tell you?

53
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:15,996
That someone very close to me will die soon.

54
00:06:17,972 --> 00:06:21,908
Listen, Clark. You can't let some old lady
scare you with a half-baked prediction.

55
00:06:22,076 --> 00:06:24,874
I mean, she probably just does it
to scare the nurses anyway.

56
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:27,309
She told Pete he'd be walking home,
seconds later...

57
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:29,711
...he realized that he
locked his keys in his car.

58
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:31,544
No one can tell the future.

59
00:06:31,752 --> 00:06:35,119
What if she can? What if she told me
because I can do something about it?

60
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,383
Then she should have given you
more information: name, time, place.

61
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:42,552
Yeah, and even if she can predict
the future, she can't control it. Nobody can.

62
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,234
Fate's given you a second chance,
Harry boy.

63
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,503
And this time...

64
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:34,805
...they're gonna pay.

65
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:37,876
Order up.

66
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:58,169
God, I haven't been able to eat one of these
in years. I mean, not since the bypass.

67
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:03,469
-That was a joke.
-You're a riot.

68
00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:06,135
What can I get you to drink?

69
00:08:09,617 --> 00:08:14,247
How much is coffee?
From, you know, beans?

70
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:15,683
$2.75.

71
00:08:16,524 --> 00:08:18,492
They carry it from
South America by foot?

72
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:22,389
-You sound like my grandpa.
-Just make sure it's hot.

73
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:25,191
Yep. Whatever.

74
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:27,732
It's not your fault, Lana.

75
00:08:27,902 --> 00:08:31,235
Do you know anyone else who's lost
an entire old person in a wheelchair?

76
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:35,466
Nope, that's pretty impressive,
even by Smallville standards.

77
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:36,973
Maybe he was kidnapped.

78
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:39,907
Who'd want to kidnap Harry?
He's just a harmless old man.

79
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:42,514
Maybe a koi turned into a piranha
and ate him.

80
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:45,681
You asked for my help.
I'm just thinking out of the box.

81
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:48,013
I like your theory.

82
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:50,713
You might want to work on
your eavesdropping technique.

83
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:55,191
Sorry. I'm new in town. I just heard
this is where young people congregate.

84
00:08:57,064 --> 00:09:00,124
Yeah, we congregate here often.

85
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:03,031
Hi, I'm Clark.
The rude one's Chloe, and this is--

86
00:09:03,237 --> 00:09:05,102
Lana Lang.

87
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,598
Nametag was a big clue.

88
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:13,176
So good luck finding
your missing old person.

89
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,219
Enjoy your coffee.
They brought it in by burro this morning.

90
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:26,859
Thanks, honey. You're a doll.

91
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,110
You play beautifully.

92
00:09:48,515 --> 00:09:50,915
I was supposed to attend
the Metropolis Conservatory.

93
00:09:51,118 --> 00:09:56,954
Your voice sounds young. The conservatory
closed its doors in the '70s.

94
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:03,252
I mean, I've always dreamed of attending
there. If I'd lived in a different time.

95
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:11,398
Any chance you could give an old lady
a hand back to her room?

96
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:15,840
I already know my future.

97
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:39,421
You might consider rounding those curves at
a speed that won't break the sound barrier.

98
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,467
-Where's the fun in that?
-Seriously. You could get hurt.

99
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,661
Why the sudden interest in my health?

100
00:10:46,774 --> 00:10:50,540
I met this woman at the retirement center,
and she can kind of see the future.

101
00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:54,238
-She tell you your future?
-Not exactly.

102
00:10:54,682 --> 00:10:57,583
She said someone
very close to me would....

103
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:59,912
-Die?
-I know it sounds nuts...

104
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:02,521
...but when you talk to her,
it's like she really knows.

105
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,851
Clark, she knows when
she has a good audience.

106
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:08,051
-You sound like my parents.
-That's gotta be a first.

107
00:11:09,663 --> 00:11:11,631
Lex, I think this woman is the real deal.

108
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:14,768
Well, then the question
you gotta ask yourself is:

109
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:17,460
Do you really want to know the future?

110
00:11:17,638 --> 00:11:20,630
Don't you wish you knew
how it was all gonna turn out?

111
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:23,743
Life's a journey. I don't want to
go through it following a road map.

112
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:25,912
It still wouldn't kill you
to drive more slowly.

113
00:11:26,113 --> 00:11:30,072
Why? I have you as a friend.
You changed my future once, right?

114
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,887
Got some more deliveries to make.

115
00:11:39,393 --> 00:11:43,352
-You never told me this woman's name.
-Thought you weren't interested.

116
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:46,259
Maybe I'll ask her for some stock tips.

117
00:11:48,402 --> 00:11:50,734
Cassandra Carver.

118
00:11:56,677 --> 00:11:58,907
I don't think that's
gonna help bring Harry back.

119
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:00,876
Clark, what are you doing here so late?

120
00:12:01,048 --> 00:12:05,382
I came to see Cassandra, if she's still up.
What happened to Harry's younger picture?

121
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:07,281
I don't know.

122
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:09,513
Is everything okay?

123
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:15,387
I met with the administrator, you know,
to tell them what I knew about Harry.

124
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:16,688
The police were there.

125
00:12:16,897 --> 00:12:19,388
Well, it's a missing person case.
It's not unusual.

126
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,798
That's not the reason.
Harry Bollston's real name is Harry Volk.

127
00:12:24,171 --> 00:12:25,729
He was a murderer, Clark.

128
00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:28,739
A murderer? Why would they let
someone like that stay here?

129
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:32,139
Because it happened 60 years ago,
when he was 17. He served his time.

130
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:36,214
They figured he was just a harmless old man
who moved back to his hometown to die.

131
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,681
Back in the '40s he was studying to be
a concert pianist. He was up...

132
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:42,788
...for a full scholarship
to the Metropolis Conservatory.

133
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:44,890
But his teacher recommended
somebody else.

134
00:12:46,393 --> 00:12:47,655
So he killed his teacher?

135
00:12:47,895 --> 00:12:54,130
No. He said the teacher killed his dream,
so he killed the teacher's dream.

136
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:55,563
The man's son.

137
00:12:59,673 --> 00:13:01,800
<i>He's got three on the clock,
he'd better hurry.</i>

138
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:07,811
Throw the ball! Throw the ball!
Watch the blitz! Yes! Yes!

139
00:13:08,015 --> 00:13:09,107
You got it!

140
00:13:11,652 --> 00:13:15,213
Damn it. Circuit breaker.

141
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:29,932
Evening. Sorry about the trouble. We got
a faulty line about a mile down the road.

142
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:33,436
I just wanted to make sure your
circuit breaker hadn't been fried.

143
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:39,578
-Anybody else at home?
-No, I'm divorced.

144
00:13:39,746 --> 00:13:44,149
I saw the name on the account was
Jim Gage. Any relation to a Randolph Gage?

145
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:48,515
Well, I'd say so. He was my father.
Passed back in '93.

146
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:53,285
I remember reading his obituary. It said he
opened the first car dealership in Smallville.

147
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:58,260
-In 1935. You got a good memory.
-Thanks. I had a lot of time to kill.

148
00:13:58,432 --> 00:14:01,196
We got three dealerships
in three counties now.

149
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:09,100
Sounds like your father
left you a bright future.

150
00:14:18,952 --> 00:14:23,821
Are you gonna come in or not, Mr. Kent?

151
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:27,118
-How do you do that?
-When one sense goes...

152
00:14:27,294 --> 00:14:29,660
...the others get heightened.

153
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:35,091
I must admit, after yesterday,
I thought I'd never see you again.

154
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:37,661
Sit.

155
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:46,438
What you told me
I can't get out of my head.

156
00:14:46,613 --> 00:14:51,107
Imagine how I feel.
When it first started happening...

157
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:54,448
...I thought it was a curse.

158
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:59,752
I kept getting snapshots
of things I couldn't control.

159
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,396
-When did they start?
-When I first lost my sight.

160
00:15:03,597 --> 00:15:07,897
It's funny. I woke up
that morning like any other.

161
00:15:08,602 --> 00:15:10,433
Then the meteors came.

162
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:16,576
One hit a field behind my house,
the flash burnt my optic nerves.

163
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:20,205
-I'm sorry.
-It's not your fault.

164
00:15:21,581 --> 00:15:26,541
It's amazing how one moment
can change your life forever.

165
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,081
My friends and family,
they think that you're--

166
00:15:33,293 --> 00:15:34,624
A fraud?

167
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:39,990
People are afraid of the unknown, Clark.

168
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:44,627
They only want to know if everything's
gonna turn out all right.

169
00:15:45,105 --> 00:15:49,838
I can't guarantee that.
What I can show you...

170
00:15:50,043 --> 00:15:55,447
...are signposts on your journey.
What you do with them is up to you.

171
00:15:57,851 --> 00:16:01,014
I've got so many questions in my life,
I just want some answers.

172
00:16:04,624 --> 00:16:06,683
Closer.

173
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:17,099
Now, take my hand.

174
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,520
No.

175
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:45,454
No!

176
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:51,568
No!

177
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,167
No.

178
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:59,209
You saw that too. Clark?

179
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:11,555
Clark, maybe you were having
some kind of hallucination.

180
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:14,990
It wasn't a hallucination, it was
a glimpse of the future. My future.

181
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:17,323
And you saw an endless graveyard.

182
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:19,362
Like I was the last person on earth.

183
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:22,525
Look, son, I don't know what
you did or didn't see, but, come on...

184
00:17:22,702 --> 00:17:24,693
-...you gotta consider the source.
-Your dad's right.

185
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:26,395
We don't know anything about her.

186
00:17:26,573 --> 00:17:28,507
I know she lost her vision
in the meteor shower.

187
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,575
And that makes it so that
she can predict the future?

188
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:36,239
Is it so crazy? I'm hit by a car and I'm fine, I
walk through fire and I'm okay. What's next?

189
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:39,749
You can't let this one image
consume your whole life.

190
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,912
What if it is my destiny,
to outlive everyone that I love?

191
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,785
I don't wanna be alone.

192
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:52,359
Clark.

193
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:57,967
-I don't know what your future holds.
-I think this woman has the answers.

194
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:01,572
The only person who controls
your destiny is you.

195
00:18:01,775 --> 00:18:04,869
Well, right now I don't feel like
I have control of anything.

196
00:18:14,554 --> 00:18:16,988
Cassandra Carver?

197
00:18:17,657 --> 00:18:23,061
Do those expensive shoes
come with a name?

198
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:25,263
Lex Luthor.

199
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:30,560
Of Luthor.... Everything Incorporated?

200
00:18:31,104 --> 00:18:32,162
More or less.

201
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:37,436
And what does the savior of Smallville
want with an old, blind woman?

202
00:18:37,644 --> 00:18:40,238
You seem to have made an impression
on my friend Clark.

203
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:43,507
So you came to see for yourself.

204
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:46,945
Clark's not stupid.
If he says you know things...

205
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,350
...there must be something
that made him think that.

206
00:18:49,723 --> 00:18:52,351
What gives me the feeling...

207
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:56,292
...you're not here for stock tips,
Mr. Luthor?

208
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:02,498
Please, call me Lex. I was hoping you could
give me some insight into Clark.

209
00:19:02,836 --> 00:19:08,468
-And you call him a friend, do you?
-He saved my life, but he's also a mystery.

210
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,173
Most people are.

211
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:13,835
That's what makes them interesting.

212
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,174
I'm willing to treat this
as a professional service.

213
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:21,947
Save your money, Lex.
I can't tell you about Clark...

214
00:19:22,155 --> 00:19:24,715
...even if I wanted to.

215
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:29,521
I can only tell the future
of the person I touch.

216
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:36,628
I don't need to know my future.

217
00:19:36,836 --> 00:19:42,570
Why? Because your father already
has it mapped out for you?

218
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:45,170
I believe we make our own destiny.

219
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:49,714
And don't you want a glimpse
of what it is you'll make?

220
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:53,716
Maybe I'll see your friend Clark, or....

221
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:57,584
Maybe I'll see something else.

222
00:20:00,026 --> 00:20:03,427
Goodbye, Ms. Carver.
It's been enlightening.

223
00:20:08,068 --> 00:20:12,971
Come back again. When you're ready.

224
00:20:21,248 --> 00:20:23,239
Chloe, what--?

225
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,417
She's not back yet.

226
00:20:26,286 --> 00:20:29,653
-Lana, what are you doing here?
-Chloe called me too. She said she had...

227
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,693
...some info on Harry. When I got here,
I started looking around.

228
00:20:35,862 --> 00:20:37,557
Found this.

229
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:41,060
Chloe calls it the "Wall of Weird."

230
00:20:41,268 --> 00:20:44,897
She believes everything strange in Smallville
started with the meteor shower.

231
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:48,199
How about you, Clark?
Do you believe that?

232
00:20:50,176 --> 00:20:51,541
Yeah, I guess I do.

233
00:20:53,246 --> 00:20:55,146
Does that include me?

234
00:20:55,315 --> 00:20:59,376
I'm up there with the three-headed calf
and the monster from Crater Lake.

235
00:20:59,552 --> 00:21:02,419
The stuff on this wall
has nothing to do with you.

236
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:05,819
Remember when you said people
keep their darkest secrets hidden?

237
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:10,790
Mine's out there for all the world to see.

238
00:21:11,064 --> 00:21:14,329
It's hard when everyone knows
your tragedy. They treat you differently.

239
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:16,161
Like you're gonna break.

240
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:19,736
-I'm sure they just feel bad and wanna help.
-I know. But all they do...

241
00:21:19,939 --> 00:21:23,033
...is remind you of the
most painful moment of your life.

242
00:21:24,678 --> 00:21:26,441
How would that make you feel, Clark?

243
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,176
Like I wish I could go back in time
and erase that moment forever.

244
00:21:37,424 --> 00:21:40,552
I thought high school would be different,
that I could finally start...

245
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:45,289
...putting it behind me.
But everywhere I go, there it is.

246
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,028
Maybe I should just accept my destiny.

247
00:21:49,336 --> 00:21:54,103
All I'm ever gonna be is a little girl in a
fairy-princess costume who lost her parents.

248
00:21:56,076 --> 00:21:58,704
I don't see you that way.

249
00:21:59,913 --> 00:22:02,746
I know you don't, Clark.

250
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,941
You're the only one who doesn't.

251
00:22:22,402 --> 00:22:24,597
Clark, we got your message.

252
00:22:24,771 --> 00:22:26,261
Hey, where were you?

253
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:28,634
<i>I thought we were all supposed
to meet at the Torch.</i>

254
00:22:28,808 --> 00:22:32,801
-Sorry. I didn't mean to blow you guys off.
-Will the lovely Ms. Lang be joining us?

255
00:22:33,012 --> 00:22:36,140
No, I think she had enough weirdness
for one day. What have you got?

256
00:22:36,316 --> 00:22:40,412
Guy was found dead in his house. He was
blindfolded and strangled with a piano wire.

257
00:22:40,587 --> 00:22:43,784
Which is the same signature
Harry Volk used in 1945.

258
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:45,254
Sounds like a copycat.

259
00:22:45,425 --> 00:22:48,360
A copycat of a murder that happened
60 years ago, two days after...

260
00:22:48,528 --> 00:22:50,860
...the original killer disappears?
I don't think so.

261
00:22:51,064 --> 00:22:54,727
Harry's in a wheelchair. Not exactly
in prime condition to go on a crime spree.

262
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:57,402
Well, I found this picture of Harry
from the '40s.

263
00:22:57,704 --> 00:23:01,265
-Looks like the kid we saw in the Beanery.
-Maybe he's got a grandson or something.

264
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:02,806
Or maybe it's Harry.

265
00:23:02,976 --> 00:23:05,843
I don't think we should start looking
for time machines just yet.

266
00:23:06,012 --> 00:23:08,139
Okay, fine. Where do you think
we should start?

267
00:23:08,314 --> 00:23:12,774
If someone is following in Harry's footsteps,
maybe they sent him fan mail.

268
00:23:30,136 --> 00:23:31,865
We close at 9, Mozart.

269
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:37,071
Your piano needs tuning.

270
00:23:37,277 --> 00:23:40,246
That's because nobody's played it in years.

271
00:23:40,513 --> 00:23:44,415
-You want to settle up?
-Can I get one more coffee?

272
00:23:46,553 --> 00:23:47,986
Don't you have somewhere to go?

273
00:23:48,188 --> 00:23:50,748
Oh, come on. You can clean up
to the sounds of Chopin.

274
00:23:54,194 --> 00:23:56,287
I guess.

275
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:06,472
What if someone sees us
searching Harry's room?

276
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:10,905
-How about we don't get seen?
-Clark, is that you?

277
00:24:11,578 --> 00:24:15,105
Harry's room is down the hallway.
I'll meet you there.

278
00:24:18,585 --> 00:24:21,952
The other night you left in a hurry.

279
00:24:22,121 --> 00:24:24,089
Sit.

280
00:24:27,694 --> 00:24:30,060
I hoped you'd come back.

281
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,255
I'm sorry.

282
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:36,191
You saw that....
Whatever it was.

283
00:24:37,437 --> 00:24:43,467
I always see them.
The question is, how did you?

284
00:24:44,978 --> 00:24:50,314
-I don't know. Wasn't I supposed to?
-Nobody ever has.

285
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:57,719
-Why me?
-Because we both know...

286
00:24:57,891 --> 00:25:00,951
...you're not like other people.

287
00:25:01,995 --> 00:25:05,294
-Sure I am.
-No, Clark, I've seen you.

288
00:25:05,465 --> 00:25:07,399
Before we ever met.

289
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,903
More than once, I've touched people
and I've seen such...

290
00:25:14,073 --> 00:25:16,564
...pain and despair and--

291
00:25:16,743 --> 00:25:21,407
But then you were there
and the pain was gone.

292
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:26,608
I think that's your destiny, Clark.

293
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:32,315
To help people, to save them
from fear and darkness.

294
00:25:32,492 --> 00:25:36,223
-How?
-Well, that's for you to figure out.

295
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:41,395
You can fear the future or...

296
00:25:41,568 --> 00:25:43,536
...you can embrace it.

297
00:25:46,906 --> 00:25:49,602
The choice is yours.

298
00:26:10,163 --> 00:26:14,293
-Who are they?
-People who need your help.

299
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:18,396
How can I help them
if I don't know who they are?

300
00:26:18,605 --> 00:26:24,908
I'm not a radio. I don't pick up continuous
transmissions. That's all I have.

301
00:26:27,013 --> 00:26:29,140
I'll figure it out.

302
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:33,977
Clark. Your secret's safe with me.

303
00:26:43,596 --> 00:26:45,086
You guys have any luck?

304
00:26:45,264 --> 00:26:49,064
<i>No fan mail, just a bunch of old news
clippings from the Smallville Ledger.</i>

305
00:26:49,235 --> 00:26:52,466
Obituaries, articles.

306
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:55,403
Guy's been obsessed with Smallville
for 50 years.

307
00:26:55,808 --> 00:26:57,935
-Clark, is something wrong?
-It's her.

308
00:26:58,144 --> 00:27:00,977
-It's who?
-I've gotta go.

309
00:27:11,858 --> 00:27:17,296
Thanks for the serenade, but unless
you're sleeping here, which you're not...

310
00:27:17,664 --> 00:27:19,689
...I'm heading out.

311
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:24,264
-What's this?
-They don't teach Greek in school anymore?

312
00:27:24,504 --> 00:27:29,339
It's Euripides. "The sins of the father
are visited on the children."

313
00:27:29,676 --> 00:27:35,546
You play Beethoven and you speak Greek.
Real cute. What's it got to do with me?

314
00:27:35,748 --> 00:27:39,343
Actually, Zoe Garfield, quite a bit.

315
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:47,448
Your grandmother, Eve Garfield,
she died last year, right?

316
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:53,224
I was meant for big cities,
great concert halls. That was my destiny.

317
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:57,870
And your grandmother,
she helped kill that future.

318
00:27:58,071 --> 00:27:59,402
And now...

319
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:03,707
...I'm gonna kill yours.

320
00:28:12,185 --> 00:28:15,848
-Let her go!
-Don't move, don't move, don't move!

321
00:28:26,265 --> 00:28:28,199
I said, let her go.

322
00:28:30,136 --> 00:28:32,900
Didn't your parents teach you
to respect your elders?

323
00:28:42,381 --> 00:28:44,281
Oh, no!

324
00:28:46,219 --> 00:28:48,187
Take care of her.

325
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:39,161
Zoe's gonna be okay, but that
truck driver could have sworn he hit you.

326
00:29:39,338 --> 00:29:42,774
-Don't worry, he's not asking any questions.
-Is that kid in jail?

327
00:29:42,942 --> 00:29:45,376
No, he's in the hospital
overnight for observation.

328
00:29:45,645 --> 00:29:47,237
Does Zoe know why
he wanted to kill her?

329
00:29:47,446 --> 00:29:49,846
She's just grateful you happened
to come along.

330
00:29:50,016 --> 00:29:52,678
-Is that what you told the police?
-I figured they wouldn't want to hear...

331
00:29:52,852 --> 00:29:57,312
-...I got a vision from an old, blind lady.
-I'm not sure how I feel about Cassandra.

332
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,051
Mom, she's my friend.
She told me my destiny was to help people.

333
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,058
You don't think she knows your secret?

334
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:11,368
-I don't think you should see her anymore.
-lf I hadn't seen her, Zoe would be dead!

335
00:30:11,571 --> 00:30:14,631
Your destiny may be to protect people,
but ours is to protect you...

336
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:16,536
...and that's gotta come first, okay?

337
00:30:18,678 --> 00:30:21,044
My mom said you called?

338
00:30:21,514 --> 00:30:23,345
Is this the Porsche from--?

339
00:30:23,516 --> 00:30:25,643
I don't understand.
Why do you still have it?

340
00:30:25,818 --> 00:30:30,380
I once read about a rich man
who survived a hotel fire.

341
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:35,289
He hung onto the ledge for an hour
before the fire department rescued him.

342
00:30:35,461 --> 00:30:41,093
Afterwards, he bought the hotel.
Always stayed in that room.

343
00:30:41,267 --> 00:30:45,636
When they asked him why, he said
he figured fate couldn't find him twice.

344
00:30:45,805 --> 00:30:47,932
I thought you didn't believe in fate.

345
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,803
I don't. But every time
I look at this car, I wonder.

346
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,078
I had a team go over this thing
inch by inch.

347
00:30:57,283 --> 00:31:01,413
They tell me there's no way the impact
could have ripped open the roof like this.

348
00:31:02,555 --> 00:31:04,955
They must have made a mistake.

349
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:08,450
Do you remember anything
about the accident?

350
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:12,490
No, just that I pulled you out, that's it.

351
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:16,768
I thought you might be able
to tell me more.

352
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,498
I'm sorry.

353
00:31:20,273 --> 00:31:23,538
It's a little strange to be walking around
when every shred of evidence...

354
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:27,406
...says I should be dead.
An unsolved mystery, I guess.

355
00:31:27,613 --> 00:31:29,478
Maybe fate has something else
in mind for you.

356
00:31:31,984 --> 00:31:34,418
You've been spending
too much time with Cassandra.

357
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,417
At least she doesn't dwell on the past.

358
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:40,925
Lex, you're alive.

359
00:31:41,093 --> 00:31:44,995
The question that you need to ask yourself
now is, where do you go from here?

360
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:51,893
I'm here to pick up the kid from the
Beanery assault, take him into custody.

361
00:31:52,071 --> 00:31:55,529
Right, the young John Doe. He's all yours.
We've got him locked up in here.

362
00:31:55,708 --> 00:31:58,836
I checked on him this morning.
He's sleeping like a baby.

363
00:32:04,884 --> 00:32:07,318
Help me.

364
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:09,350
The police questioned Harry
all morning.

365
00:32:09,522 --> 00:32:12,650
He said he was kidnapped by this kid
who was obsessed with his old case.

366
00:32:12,858 --> 00:32:15,554
Somehow, in broad daylight,
this kid got out of handcuffs...

367
00:32:15,728 --> 00:32:18,128
...smuggled Harry inside
and chained him to a bed?

368
00:32:18,297 --> 00:32:20,026
That's the official story.

369
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:22,292
It may be official,
but it doesn't make sense.

370
00:32:23,636 --> 00:32:25,467
You can always add it
to the Wall of Weird.

371
00:32:31,844 --> 00:32:34,039
Clark, are you all right?

372
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:40,584
Not really. I think I'll go inside
and talk to Harry.

373
00:32:53,132 --> 00:32:56,568
You know, I found a picture of Zoe Garfield
in a box under your bed.

374
00:32:56,836 --> 00:32:59,862
-And who are you?
-Clark Kent, but we've already met.

375
00:33:00,072 --> 00:33:02,563
How dare you go through my belongings.

376
00:33:02,842 --> 00:33:06,039
-How do you explain the pictures?
-And why do I need to explain them?

377
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:08,042
You know what, Harry?

378
00:33:09,782 --> 00:33:12,876
I think you and this kid are the same person.

379
00:33:13,886 --> 00:33:17,378
I'd say you have a very active imagination.

380
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,581
I don't know how you did it,
but I know it's you.

381
00:33:21,093 --> 00:33:24,426
You said your name was Kent?

382
00:33:24,597 --> 00:33:28,055
Grandfather, Hiram. Father, Jonathan.

383
00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:33,866
Funny. I don't remember you
on the family tree.

384
00:33:35,608 --> 00:33:36,905
I'll be watching you.

385
00:33:39,245 --> 00:33:41,406
Nurse?

386
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:48,150
Nurse! Help me, somebody! Help!

387
00:33:49,155 --> 00:33:55,583
Oh, nurse! Nurse, he's harassing me.
Haven't I been through enough?

388
00:33:55,795 --> 00:33:59,993
-I think you should leave, young man.
-Don't worry, I'm going.

389
00:34:31,197 --> 00:34:34,928
<i>This is everything I could find on Harry Volk.
The Ledger carried stories on the trial...</i>

390
00:34:35,101 --> 00:34:37,092
...the murder, the investigation, you name it.

391
00:34:37,269 --> 00:34:39,965
-Is anybody watching this guy?
-Lana's got an eye on him.

392
00:34:42,308 --> 00:34:44,037
I heard that.

393
00:34:44,243 --> 00:34:46,473
-What exactly are we looking for?
-I don't know.

394
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,409
There's gotta be a connection
between the people Harry's going after.

395
00:34:49,582 --> 00:34:53,848
In Zoe Garfield's statement, she said Harry
accused her grandmother of killing his future.

396
00:34:55,955 --> 00:34:59,789
Harry's gone. They found his wheelchair
out by the koi pond half an hour ago.

397
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:01,816
I saw meteor rocks in that pond.

398
00:35:02,027 --> 00:35:03,961
At least now we know
how he's doing the time warp.

399
00:35:04,163 --> 00:35:06,996
-What do you mean?
-I'll explain later.

400
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:08,963
We gotta figure out
who he's gonna kill next.

401
00:35:10,503 --> 00:35:13,165
-Clark, take a look at this.
-What is it?

402
00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:15,204
List of the jurors
that worked on Harry's trial.

403
00:35:15,808 --> 00:35:18,936
Randolph Gage, Rita Garfield....

404
00:35:19,111 --> 00:35:21,671
He's killing the descendents
of the jurors who convicted him.

405
00:35:21,881 --> 00:35:23,348
Talk about not letting it go.

406
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:28,148
-Clark, what is it?
-Look at juror number 11.

407
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:36,060
Hiram Kent. Wasn't that your grandfather?

408
00:35:36,495 --> 00:35:37,860
Harry's gonna kill my dad.

409
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:42,900
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, got a report about a gas leak.

410
00:35:43,068 --> 00:35:45,696
You mind if I come in?

411
00:35:48,574 --> 00:35:51,134
Gas leak. I don't smell gas.

412
00:35:51,343 --> 00:35:53,743
Your husband called about it earlier.
Is he around?

413
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:57,575
He'll be back shortly.
Where's our regular gas man, Kurt?

414
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:00,877
-Vacation.
-That's right.

415
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:03,112
Would you excuse me a minute?

416
00:36:21,273 --> 00:36:24,242
Kurt isn't your regular gas man,
is he, Mrs. Kent?

417
00:36:25,411 --> 00:36:28,346
-What do you want?
-Kill your husband.

418
00:36:29,114 --> 00:36:32,083
-What did Jonathan ever do to you?
-Nothing.

419
00:36:33,419 --> 00:36:34,681
But his father did.

420
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:29,337
Come on, Mrs. Kent!
I'm too old for hide-and-seek!

421
00:37:50,029 --> 00:37:52,429
Jonathan!

422
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:57,534
You can't save him, Mrs. Kent.

423
00:38:38,644 --> 00:38:40,805
-Clark!
-Are you okay?

424
00:38:40,979 --> 00:38:42,970
-What's the matter?
-Where's Mom?

425
00:38:43,182 --> 00:38:45,707
-I don't know.
-Somebody's trying to kill you.

426
00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:46,942
What?

427
00:38:50,823 --> 00:38:52,256
He's already here.

428
00:39:18,283 --> 00:39:19,580
No!

429
00:39:22,755 --> 00:39:26,748
Martha. Martha!

430
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:29,928
Mom! Mom!

431
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:31,694
Martha, come on!

432
00:39:31,864 --> 00:39:33,422
Mom, come on! Mom!

433
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,189
Martha!

434
00:39:36,568 --> 00:39:39,537
-Come on, Mom, breathe!
-Martha!

435
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,477
Are you okay?

436
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,444
You think I'd ever leave you two alone?

437
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:04,087
Cassandra was wrong, Clark.

438
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:08,329
Nobody's gonna die.

439
00:40:19,178 --> 00:40:24,582
Well. You're the last person
I expected to walk through my door.

440
00:40:24,783 --> 00:40:27,752
I come bearing gifts.

441
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,888
So did the Greeks.

442
00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:33,548
I wanted to take you up on your offer.

443
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:37,526
I thought you controlled
your own destiny.

444
00:40:37,996 --> 00:40:43,696
I do. But certain things have happened
in my life, signs I don't want to ignore.

445
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:47,668
-What kind of signs?
-I lived when I should have died.

446
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,500
There must be a reason for that.
You see, I don't want to do good things.

447
00:40:52,678 --> 00:40:56,739
-I want to do great things.
-Well, you don't need me for that.

448
00:40:57,749 --> 00:41:01,241
What's the matter, Cassandra?
Are you afraid of what you'll see?

449
00:41:02,321 --> 00:41:04,380
Sit.

450
00:41:07,459 --> 00:41:12,294
Well. You've been warned.

451
00:42:20,732 --> 00:42:22,324
What did you see?

452
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:50,756
I need some help in here!

453
00:42:53,865 --> 00:42:55,958
Somebody?

454
00:42:56,768 --> 00:42:58,702
Ms. Carver?

455
00:43:11,984 --> 00:43:14,646
I'm sorry, son, she's gone.

456
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,388
-She saw it.
-Saw what?

457
00:43:23,228 --> 00:43:25,423
Her future.

458
00:44:09,474 --> 00:44:10,463
