1
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:21,026
Let me go.

2
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:32,471
What do you want from me?

3
00:00:32,813 --> 00:00:34,713
The truth.

4
00:00:40,688 --> 00:00:44,089
-Can I see some ID?
-You must be new here.

5
00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:46,726
Hey, it's okay, let him through.

6
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,093
-Thanks, Kasich.
-No problem.

7
00:00:56,804 --> 00:01:00,205
-She's cute.
-She's engaged.

8
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:08,338
What do you think?

9
00:01:12,786 --> 00:01:14,811
It's loud.

10
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,091
-How's the VIP room tonight?
-I think we can make some room for you.

11
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,794
I hope you didn't feel obligated
to entertain me.

12
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:26,728
Jude's only gone for a couple days.

13
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:30,598
I don't believe in obligations.
Besides, your fiance did me a favor.

14
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:34,138
I wasn't looking forward to a night out
on my own.

15
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:38,772
Something tells me you wouldn't
have been alone for very long.

16
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,048
-Two apple martinis.
-Coming up.

17
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:45,713
"Zero consequences."

18
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,315
That's quite a promise.

19
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:50,889
Only if it's kept.

20
00:01:51,192 --> 00:01:54,093
To my good friend Amanda
on her engagement.

21
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:55,660
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

22
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,024
What is it?

23
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,699
What are you doing?

24
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:19,081
-Amanda.
-You said you had to go away on business.

25
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,488
I can explain, okay? Just wait.

26
00:02:21,722 --> 00:02:23,280
Amanda, wait a sec--

27
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:28,156
I can explain, Amanda. Just wait.
Amanda!

28
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,995
You son of a bitch.
You did this on purpose.

29
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:38,829
You did it to yourself.
Amanda deserves better.

30
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:35,121
Liar! That's what it said in the papers,
but that's not what really happened.

31
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,493
-It's the truth. Read the police reports!
-I know you covered it up.

32
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,635
I don't know how you did it,
but you're gonna pay.

33
00:03:41,802 --> 00:03:43,394
Who are you?

34
00:03:44,505 --> 00:03:46,598
Don't you remember?

35
00:03:49,076 --> 00:03:50,475
You killed me.

36
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:00,745
Daddy can't save you this time, Lex.

37
00:04:57,578 --> 00:05:00,274
There is nothing like 50 minutes
of Mr. Austin's English class...

38
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:03,439
-...that works up an appetite.
-Nothing like a student biography...

39
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:05,949
-...due Monday to help me lose mine.
-The biography part...

40
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,918
...or the fact that our student subjects
were randomly assigned?

41
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:11,353
Pete's convinced that the drawing
was fixed.

42
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:15,222
There are a dozen ladies in our class,
each worthy of lengthy interrogation.

43
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:19,298
-I get stuck with Stan Gibson?
-The manager of the student store?

44
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:20,933
-I hear he's very--
-Efficient?

45
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:24,730
Very funny. I'm about to learn more about
the art of selling "Go Crow" pennants...

46
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:27,135
...than any human should have to endure.

47
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:30,140
You haven't stopped smiling since we left.
Who's your victim?

48
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,473
The illustrious Mr. Kent himself.

49
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,942
-Me?
-I take it back.

50
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:36,912
Chloe's the one with the challenge.

51
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:38,551
-Excuse me?
-No offense, Clark...

52
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:40,744
...but digging up six pages of interesting
on you...

53
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:43,389
-...is gonna require serious excavation.
-I do stuff.

54
00:05:43,557 --> 00:05:46,685
Yes, and I'm sure that once I deploy
my journalistic skills on you...

55
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,452
...l'll unearth a skeleton or two.

56
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:52,065
You know, Chloe, this is a class project,
not a corruption scandal.

57
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:54,666
Relax. It's not like you
have anything to hide, right?

58
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:57,531
Come on, Clark, cough up.
Who'd you get?

59
00:05:57,704 --> 00:06:00,036
Don't tell me. Lana Lang.

60
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:02,437
Just look at his face,
you don't even have to see it.

61
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:04,668
Like I said, definitely rigged.

62
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:07,643
-I assume you'll start your paper ASAP?
-It's all gonna work out.

63
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:10,579
I'm helping Lana at the Talon
getting ready for the opening.

64
00:06:10,751 --> 00:06:14,346
Surrogate boyfriend does the heavy lifting
while Whitney works at his dad's store.

65
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:15,954
-On that note....
-Wait.

66
00:06:16,123 --> 00:06:18,148
When are you gonna sit down
to do my interview?

67
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:21,692
Right. I'll be around.

68
00:06:21,929 --> 00:06:24,022
Did he just blow me off?

69
00:06:24,198 --> 00:06:27,895
One step forward, two steps back.
Come on.

70
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:34,698
You promised everything would be ready
on time.

71
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,275
That was before the plumbing
started leaking.

72
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:40,845
-Hasn't been replaced in years.
-How long will that take?

73
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:46,782
I can't really give you a straight answer,
not until I crawl up there.

74
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:50,586
You resurrect the past,
you get the problems that come with it.

75
00:06:50,757 --> 00:06:53,555
Lex Luthor's going to be by later.
He's going to need numbers...

76
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:57,390
...and a timetable
and a better explanation than that.

77
00:07:04,638 --> 00:07:09,439
-Sorry, we're not open yet.
-It's about the assistant manager position.

78
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,942
I know I'm late, but if I can get
an application....

79
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:16,811
-Yeah, yeah, just give me a second.
-Great. Really appreciate this, Miss...?

80
00:07:16,984 --> 00:07:18,212
-Lang.
-Lang.

81
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:21,946
And just to warn you, my aunt's not taking
any more interviews until next week.

82
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:25,421
Well, that's all right.
I happen to have all the time in the world.

83
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:28,755
-I'm Jude Royce.
-Hi.

84
00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:32,957
So I understand that Lex Luthor
has a stake in this project.

85
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:36,298
Yeah, he's one of the owners.
Why? Do you know him?

86
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:41,165
-A lifetime ago in Metropolis.
-Must have been interesting.

87
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:45,144
Well, let's just say there's a reason
he's in Smallville.

88
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:49,846
You know my advice? Stay away from him.

89
00:07:50,284 --> 00:07:53,776
When Lex gets involved,
things usually turn out badly.

90
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,966
What are you doing here?
We had an understanding.

91
00:08:15,142 --> 00:08:17,406
After that night,
we were never to have any contact.

92
00:08:17,578 --> 00:08:19,705
-I saw him, Lex.
-Who?

93
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,643
Jude.

94
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:25,542
-We both know that's impossible.
-Listen to me! He's alive.

95
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:27,380
Everywhere I go, I see him.

96
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:30,114
-He's stalking me.
-Kasich. Calm down.

97
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:32,323
I'm not crazy.

98
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:37,527
-This man say what he wanted?
-Yeah. The truth.

99
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:43,228
Listen. I keep an apartment in the city.

100
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:47,931
It's very secure. You stay there
and wait for my call.

101
00:08:56,617 --> 00:08:58,608
-Hey, Lex.
-Hey.

102
00:08:58,785 --> 00:09:01,447
-Who was that?
-Nobody.

103
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:06,423
I hear we sprung a leak.

104
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:10,826
Is everything all right?

105
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:14,594
-Just a little weirded out.
-Relax, it's just a leak.

106
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:18,066
No, a friend of yours came by,
applied for the assistant manager position.

107
00:09:18,505 --> 00:09:21,838
He told me to stay away from you.

108
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:26,541
What was his name?

109
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:31,879
Jude Royce.

110
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:44,421
-What is it, Lex?
-When did he leave?

111
00:09:44,598 --> 00:09:46,031
Just before you came in.

112
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:02,540
Lex, who's Jude Royce?

113
00:10:02,783 --> 00:10:05,684
Trust me, Clark,
I have no idea who Lana met today...

114
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:08,082
...but it couldn't have been him.

115
00:10:10,624 --> 00:10:13,286
Don't worry about it, Clark. I'm not.

116
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:29,940
What's going on?

117
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:31,803
I don't know!

118
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,111
Feel under the dash.

119
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:57,103
Looks like someone decided
to get creative while I was inside.

120
00:10:57,704 --> 00:10:59,035
What were the screams?

121
00:10:59,573 --> 00:11:02,872
I assume it's someone's twisted idea
of a joke.

122
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:05,807
And a successful one.
We've managed to draw a crowd.

123
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:16,054
-Lex.
-Clark, this really doesn't concern you.

124
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:29,865
Hello, anybody home?

125
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,471
Hey, pull up a microphone, son.

126
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:37,499
-Chloe, what's going on?
-Since I couldn't find you...

127
00:11:37,677 --> 00:11:40,510
...I decided to start my biographical inquiry
at the beginning.

128
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,648
Unlike a certain
so-called friend of mine...

129
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:45,011
...your parents gracefully agreed
to be interviewed.

130
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:48,245
Chloe's been asking us
some very interesting questions, Clark.

131
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:51,555
Thank you.
Now, we just have a few more to go, so....

132
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:54,226
We were talking about the early days.

133
00:11:54,427 --> 00:11:56,657
Now, what was involved in adopting Clark?

134
00:11:57,998 --> 00:12:01,798
Well, it was-- It was just like
any normal adoption, I guess.

135
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:05,267
Can you take me through the process?
Did it takes weeks or months?

136
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:08,532
Did you guys use a lawyer,
or did you go through an agen--?

137
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:13,611
Shoot. I'm out of tape. That's okay,
I've got some extra C-90s in my car.

138
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,543
I'll be right back.

139
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:21,016
Chloe's researching your life
for a school project?

140
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:23,656
-When did that happen?
-We just got the assignment today.

141
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:25,553
I didn't know she was gonna
go Mike Wallace.

142
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,386
We don't mind talking about you...

143
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:30,121
...but if she starts asking questions
about the adoption....

144
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,794
What about the adoption?

145
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,558
Is there something I should know?

146
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:39,497
Well, of course,
we had to make up a story...

147
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:41,538
...but it's more complicated
than that.

148
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,700
Let's just say it's a subject
we would rather not have anyone explore.

149
00:12:44,878 --> 00:12:46,277
Sorry. Am I interrupting?

150
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,505
Clark, now that you're finally spinning
in my orbit...

151
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:52,049
...I have a couple of pertinents for you too.

152
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:54,244
Actually, this is just a pit stop for me.

153
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:56,651
I'm on my way to meet Lana
to work on my paper.

154
00:12:57,324 --> 00:13:02,261
You know, Clark, not to strike a
paranoid note, but are you avoiding me?

155
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,062
Tomorrow, I promise.

156
00:13:13,073 --> 00:13:15,439
Okay, this isn't an official question...

157
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:18,237
...and I don't want you guys to take it
the wrong way...

158
00:13:18,411 --> 00:13:21,312
...but has your son
always been this strange?

159
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:27,080
-How does it feel?
-Feel?

160
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:30,951
To single-handedly bring the Talon back from
the brink of becoming a parking garage?

161
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:36,125
It's nice, you know, being counted on,
having responsibility.

162
00:13:36,296 --> 00:13:39,163
-People treat you differently.
-Like you won't break.

163
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:43,328
Finally feel like I'm shedding
that fairy-princess costume.

164
00:13:55,382 --> 00:13:58,283
-Lex, what are you doing here?
-Contractor called.

165
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:01,284
Said he had an estimate,
wanted me to meet him here.

166
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:13,062
What the hell?

167
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:15,457
Are you okay?

168
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:21,439
Yeah. I came in the back door
and some guy jumped me...

169
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:24,337
...and forced me to let him in
and bashed me over the head.

170
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,502
Did you see his face?

171
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:28,840
No.

172
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:32,043
Look.

173
00:14:35,555 --> 00:14:39,548
That wasn't there when I locked up.
I'll go call the police.

174
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:46,058
Lex, your name's on it.

175
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:06,249
Zero consequences.

176
00:15:27,173 --> 00:15:29,368
How you holding up?

177
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:33,073
I was fine...until it showed up.

178
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:35,578
Yeah, stupid question.

179
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:38,616
What kind of a sick person
would do a thing like that?

180
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:41,186
I don't know.

181
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:43,989
But I've never seen Lex
so freaked out before.

182
00:15:44,157 --> 00:15:46,091
Join the club.

183
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:51,354
That guy warned me. He said everything
Lex touches ends badly.

184
00:15:52,065 --> 00:15:54,192
How much do we really know about him
and his past?

185
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:59,234
I want you both to know how truly sorry
I am about this.

186
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:01,306
I promise this won't affect
the grand opening.

187
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:05,339
We're going to be infamous
before we even open the doors.

188
00:16:16,523 --> 00:16:19,515
Do you know who he is?
The guy in the.... You know.

189
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:24,652
Max Kasich. And yes, I knew him
a long time ago in Metropolis.

190
00:16:25,932 --> 00:16:28,196
Do you have any idea
who might have done this to him?

191
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:29,665
Not at all.

192
00:16:32,105 --> 00:16:34,767
What about your old friend Jude Royce?

193
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,936
-I doubt it could have been him, Clark.
-Why?

194
00:16:39,512 --> 00:16:42,072
Because he's been dead for three years.

195
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:51,380
The only information
I got from the Kents...

196
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:54,220
...was the earth-shattering admission
that Clark hates peas.

197
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:57,363
A body part shows up at the Talon
and all you can talk about is Clark?

198
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,556
Where are your priorities?
Lex Luthor must be mixed up in this.

199
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:04,100
-I know you've got issues with the Luthors--
-More than issues.

200
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,931
You know what they did to my family.

201
00:17:06,106 --> 00:17:07,903
One piece of investigative information
at a time.

202
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:10,634
-Now, about Clark....
-Chloe, what do you want from me?

203
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,278
In a world of designer water,
Clark's from the tap.

204
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:17,143
I know, but you've known him the longest.
All I need is just a little anecdote...

205
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:20,343
...just a small piece of information
from Clark's deep, dark past.

206
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,954
Well, there was something
back in the first grade.

207
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:25,990
Thank you! That's more
than I've uncovered the past two days.

208
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:27,626
Now, please, let's continue.

209
00:17:27,794 --> 00:17:29,455
There was a bully three grades ahead.

210
00:17:29,629 --> 00:17:32,097
This dude was determined to pound dents
into every kid.

211
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:35,200
One day it was my turn.
He was just about to take my head off...

212
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:38,633
-...when Clark jumped between us.
-So Clark ran interference?

213
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:42,140
Now, as kind as that sounds, Pete...

214
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:44,742
...I don't think it falls into
the "something amazing" test.

215
00:17:44,911 --> 00:17:46,173
-What test?
-I'm not finished.

216
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:48,871
Clark didn't just push Braindead,
he put him through a door...

217
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:52,415
...as in splinters and broken hinges.
How he did it, I still have no idea.

218
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:55,577
-Guy was at least twice our size.
-Clark, any comments?

219
00:17:58,024 --> 00:18:01,824
Well, we were, you know, 6 years old.
Twice our size was three feet tall.

220
00:18:02,362 --> 00:18:04,489
If you need more ancient history,
ask the source.

221
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:07,189
I've got an appointment
at the student store.

222
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:09,130
Have fun.

223
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:12,905
And so the mystery
that isn't Clark Kent deepens.

224
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:14,300
-Mystery?
-Yeah.

225
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:16,442
Since you continue to play obstructionist...

226
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:18,975
...l've had to find information
through other means.

227
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:22,637
I found that your adoption was done
through Metropolis United Charities...

228
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:25,909
...but this is the strange part.
They were in business for six months...

229
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:28,918
...and from what I can tell,
yours is the only adoption they handled.

230
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:30,715
I can't believe you did this, Chloe.

231
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:35,885
You didn't know? I just assumed
that your parents would have told you.

232
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:38,758
-I mean, weren't you interested?
-Why would I be?

233
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:41,332
My biological parents are either dead
or didn't want me.

234
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:44,868
-You're prying into my private life.
-I was just trying to be thorough.

235
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,633
This is a class project. I spent an hour
yesterday with Lana, that's it.

236
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:53,006
That's all I needed.
I'm not some mystery for you to solve.

237
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:56,042
Clark, I....

238
00:19:01,788 --> 00:19:03,483
Talk to me, Mr. Raines.

239
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:08,184
According to the doorman, Kasich never
made it to the apartment in Metropolis.

240
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:11,524
-What about Royce?
-His parents died when he was young.

241
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:15,134
Car accident.
He was an only child, inherited everything.

242
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:17,667
And Amanda Rothman?
Have you tracked her down yet?

243
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:22,240
She moved, left no forwarding address.
When's the last time you spoke to her?

244
00:19:22,408 --> 00:19:25,707
-About three years ago.
-I'll go wider, but it could take some time.

245
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:27,743
It'd help if you tell me
what's going on.

246
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:30,306
No, it wouldn't.
You're my head of security.

247
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:32,644
You find her and warn her
she could be in danger.

248
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:34,787
That's all you need to know.

249
00:19:53,373 --> 00:19:57,571
Make a path. Police.
Excuse me, excuse me. Police.

250
00:19:58,111 --> 00:20:01,808
-Who are you?
-Detective Sam Phelan, Metropolis P.D.

251
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:04,074
Are you what passes for security
in this zoo?

252
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:08,252
-Yeah.
-Don't go anywhere. We'll talk.

253
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:11,887
-Thank God you're here.
-Lex, Lex.

254
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:14,618
You really put your foot in it this time.

255
00:20:14,794 --> 00:20:16,853
Tell me exactly what happened.

256
00:20:17,864 --> 00:20:20,890
Hey, if you fall apart on me,
I can't help you.

257
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:23,001
Now what went down?

258
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,311
That's exactly what happened?

259
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:43,552
Good. Here's how it's gonna go.

260
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:47,784
You were never here. Your name will not
appear in any papers or the police report.

261
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,794
-How?
-That's what your daddy's money's for.

262
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:54,798
This one's gonna cost him.

263
00:20:55,168 --> 00:20:59,127
-What about Amanda?
-I'll take care of everybody's story...

264
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:03,071
...but you are never to see her
or talk to her again. You got it?

265
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:06,539
Call this guy,
he'll take care of your shoulder.

266
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:09,278
No emergency rooms.

267
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,509
All right, get out of here.

268
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:27,994
-Did you see what happened?
-Most of it.

269
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:32,729
Well, smile. Because you're about to
come into some serious money.

270
00:21:56,829 --> 00:21:58,160
Nothing to say?

271
00:22:02,702 --> 00:22:07,503
-I thought Lex Luthor had all the answers.
-Look, you twisted son of a bitch.

272
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:10,870
-I don't know what you want.
-I wanna know what happened at Club Zero.

273
00:22:11,043 --> 00:22:13,011
The cover-up.

274
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,814
You know the cop?

275
00:22:16,983 --> 00:22:18,951
The one on the report? Phelan?

276
00:22:20,153 --> 00:22:22,246
He's dead.

277
00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:26,691
It seems that you were somehow involved
in that too. I find that very interesting.

278
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:30,222
Why don't you kill me now?

279
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:34,693
Because it's more fun
to watch you suffer.

280
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:37,369
Knowing that at any moment, bang!

281
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:43,102
Tell me.

282
00:22:44,744 --> 00:22:48,043
What really happened?

283
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:50,846
Lex!

284
00:22:56,556 --> 00:22:59,184
Lex, you all right?

285
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:04,954
Clark, what are you doing here?

286
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:07,695
Your office told me you were here.

287
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:11,236
I thought I heard someone else.

288
00:23:11,404 --> 00:23:14,134
No. I'm all by myself.

289
00:23:15,475 --> 00:23:17,966
Hey, I looked up Max Kasich.

290
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:20,212
I know what happened at Club Zero.

291
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:25,146
That he was shot and killed Jude Royce.
Everyone fits into this except for you.

292
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:28,251
-What's going on?
-Please, Clark.

293
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:30,981
For our friendship, I'm asking you
to stay out of this.

294
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:34,722
Some secrets are better left alone.

295
00:23:41,534 --> 00:23:43,263
Clark.

296
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:49,907
Come on, son, the cows aren't
gonna feed themselves.

297
00:23:50,176 --> 00:23:52,337
-You have a late night?
-I was helping Lana.

298
00:23:52,512 --> 00:23:56,710
She's not gonna let the whole body-part
incident delay the opening of the Talon.

299
00:23:56,883 --> 00:24:00,512
That's what happens when you get into
business with somebody like Lex Luthor.

300
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:03,280
If it wasn't for Lex,
the Talon would be a parking garage.

301
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:05,447
Son, he casts a very, very long shadow.

302
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,594
I just want to make sure
none of you kids get hurt, that's all.

303
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:12,822
The past is in the past.
The best we can do is look to the future.

304
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:14,830
All right, you got me.

305
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:18,129
Speaking of that,
how's Chloe's paper coming along?

306
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:21,740
-I assume she's done with her interviews?
-I'm not sure.

307
00:24:21,908 --> 00:24:25,241
Look, Clark, if she mentions anything
to you about the peas, I'm sorry.

308
00:24:25,411 --> 00:24:27,402
It's the first thing that came to mind.

309
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:32,017
And if she mentions anything to me
about the Metropolis United Charities?

310
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,621
I used to think perseverance
was an admirable quality.

311
00:24:38,157 --> 00:24:41,558
Since I learned the real truth,
I hadn't thought about the adoption.

312
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:45,561
Dad, Chloe told me the agency you used
was only open six months...

313
00:24:45,731 --> 00:24:48,165
...and I was the only kid adopted.

314
00:24:48,434 --> 00:24:50,402
Look, son...

315
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,804
...the process is a really tough one
even when you go through normal channels.

316
00:24:54,974 --> 00:24:57,841
With you, it was just
a little more complicated, that's all.

317
00:24:58,511 --> 00:25:02,447
-Is everything legal?
-Yeah, it's legal, it's just....

318
00:25:02,715 --> 00:25:06,014
Well, it required a higher level of access
than your mother or I had.

319
00:25:06,185 --> 00:25:08,119
What does that mean?

320
00:25:10,456 --> 00:25:14,119
Let's just say it's a long road between
what's sitting in our storm cellar...

321
00:25:14,327 --> 00:25:16,727
...and what's written
on your birth certificate.

322
00:25:19,832 --> 00:25:23,233
-You hear that?
-Hear what?

323
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:27,861
The whole herd's just over that rise.
We ought to be hearing something.

324
00:26:10,683 --> 00:26:12,378
What do you think happened?

325
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:15,520
Why would LuthorCorp
dump their stuff here?

326
00:26:24,163 --> 00:26:27,155
I'm gonna go take
from some different angles.

327
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:49,788
Mr. and Mrs. Kent, I have no idea
how this could have happened...

328
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:54,619
...but I'll do everything in my power
to find out.

329
00:26:55,594 --> 00:26:58,620
And I'll pay for your livestock, of course.

330
00:26:58,898 --> 00:27:02,061
You think that's how
you solve everything, don't you, Lex?

331
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:06,000
You sprinkle a little money on it
and hope the problem goes away.

332
00:27:06,706 --> 00:27:10,403
Well, obviously, some things
are a little more difficult than that.

333
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:21,411
I didn't think it was possible to fall
any further in your father's eyes.

334
00:27:21,587 --> 00:27:23,646
Obviously, I was wrong.

335
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:28,219
I'd never intentionally allow
something like this to happen.

336
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:30,788
Does this have anything
to do with Club Zero?

337
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:36,196
-I think so.
-You need to tell the authorities...

338
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:39,565
...everything you know.
This isn't just about you anymore.

339
00:27:46,746 --> 00:27:51,410
Mr. Luthor, the C.E.P. guy
needs to talk to you. He's over there.

340
00:28:04,296 --> 00:28:06,890
Looks like a black mark
on your company's environmental record.

341
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:10,462
-I'm gonna walk over and get the sheriff.
-And tell him what?

342
00:28:20,446 --> 00:28:22,880
Just tell him that Clark Kent called.
Thank you.

343
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:24,982
-Who was that?
-I'm trying to reach Lex.

344
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:27,244
He's not in the office.
He's not at the mansion...

345
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,944
...and his cell phone goes straight
to voice mail.

346
00:28:30,456 --> 00:28:33,516
-Where's Dad?
-Still supervising the removal of the cows.

347
00:28:33,692 --> 00:28:36,593
-Lex said he'd pay for that.
-Clark, this isn't just about money.

348
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:40,630
We don't know what kind of health threat
this poses to us or to our neighbors.

349
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:43,426
I don't think this is Lex's fault.

350
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:47,265
I think someone is trying to set him up
because of what happened at the nightclub.

351
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:48,963
Look.

352
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,704
-Until this is cleared up, I don't--
-Lex has always been a good friend.

353
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,848
I know.
I'm usually the one who defends him...

354
00:28:57,016 --> 00:29:00,144
...but there are some things in his past
that are a little shady.

355
00:29:00,686 --> 00:29:02,551
In this family we don't look at the past.

356
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:06,384
Clark, I grew up in Metropolis,
I know the Luthor world.

357
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,585
It looks glamorous and fun,
but the kids grow up too fast...

358
00:29:09,762 --> 00:29:11,286
...and they can get into trouble.

359
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,190
Whatever's happening to Lex is starting
to affect you.

360
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:18,666
Body parts in boxes and poisoned cows?
This isn't normal.

361
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:21,336
What do you want me to do?
Cut him out of my life?

362
00:29:21,507 --> 00:29:25,136
No, I want you to cool it off for a while
until we know what really happened.

363
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:30,111
Your father and I just don't want to
see you pulled into his problems.

364
00:29:40,192 --> 00:29:42,422
Can I talk to you for a second?

365
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:47,988
How you doing?

366
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:52,126
-That depends if it's on the record or not.
-Okay, I deserve that.

367
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:56,536
Look, I didn't mean to ambush you
with the whole adoption agency thing.

368
00:29:56,876 --> 00:29:59,504
Hey, you saw a story
and you went right for it.

369
00:29:59,678 --> 00:30:01,669
-That's what journalists do.
-You're right.

370
00:30:01,847 --> 00:30:03,838
I didn't think about how it would hurt you.

371
00:30:04,016 --> 00:30:08,077
And, you know,
as much as journalistic instinct rebels...

372
00:30:08,254 --> 00:30:10,449
...l'd rather have a friend
than a subject...

373
00:30:10,623 --> 00:30:13,319
...so I'm dropping the whole thing.

374
00:30:15,728 --> 00:30:17,457
Thank you.

375
00:30:18,664 --> 00:30:20,791
Can I ask you a question?

376
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:23,494
Totally off the record.

377
00:30:25,638 --> 00:30:28,266
Do you ever wonder
about your biological parents?

378
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:32,068
Every day of my life.

379
00:30:39,385 --> 00:30:42,149
Looks like I'm not the only one
doing some digging.

380
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:44,619
-What's Club Zero?
-Part of Lex's past...

381
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,054
...he asked me to stay out of.

382
00:30:48,994 --> 00:30:52,430
By the way, I brought by
some pictures for your parents.

383
00:30:52,598 --> 00:30:55,658
I figured they could use it
for insurance purposes and stuff.

384
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:58,098
I'll see you later. I gotta go.

385
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,862
Chloe...

386
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:03,906
...it's the same guy.

387
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,339
-Wait, but he's--
-Dead.

388
00:31:23,262 --> 00:31:24,991
Help!

389
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:27,993
Somebody!

390
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:30,829
Help!

391
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:33,730
Help!

392
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,134
Somebody!

393
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:43,541
No word from Lex. No one's
spoken to him since this morning.

394
00:31:43,716 --> 00:31:47,516
I pulled our alleged dead guy's license.
It's registered to a John Smith. Original.

395
00:31:47,686 --> 00:31:50,450
He has an address in Metropolis
and does not work for the C.E.P.

396
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:52,886
-How'd you do that?
-I hacked into the DMV database.

397
00:31:53,058 --> 00:31:55,618
-Sometimes persistence is a good thing.
-Call Metropolis P.D.

398
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:58,126
-Have them go to that address.
-What's going on?

399
00:31:58,297 --> 00:32:00,162
I think Lex is in serious trouble.

400
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:10,798
You ready to talk?

401
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,877
You're finally where you should have been
three years ago.

402
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:19,778
Exposed in the spotlight.

403
00:32:19,952 --> 00:32:22,512
What do you want from me?

404
00:32:23,155 --> 00:32:25,851
The truth about Club Zero.

405
00:32:53,585 --> 00:32:55,177
Kasich.

406
00:32:55,354 --> 00:32:58,255
Excuse me,
did you find anyone else in there?

407
00:33:02,828 --> 00:33:06,229
-Do you know where I can find Club Zero?
-You're six months too late, kid.

408
00:33:06,632 --> 00:33:08,463
-What do you mean?
-Well, it closed down.

409
00:33:08,634 --> 00:33:10,693
It was an old warehouse
on 78th and Main.

410
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:18,104
Liar! That's what it said in the papers,
but that's not what really happened.

411
00:33:18,277 --> 00:33:21,610
-It's the truth. Read the police reports!
-I know you covered it up.

412
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,874
I don't know how you did it,
but you're gonna pay.

413
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,483
Who are you?

414
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:29,610
Don't you remember?

415
00:33:32,157 --> 00:33:33,590
You killed me.

416
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:44,292
Daddy can't save you this time, Lex.

417
00:34:09,928 --> 00:34:11,691
No more games, Lex.

418
00:34:12,998 --> 00:34:15,262
It's time for the truth.

419
00:34:27,813 --> 00:34:30,805
I know you.
You're the contractor from the Talon.

420
00:34:30,983 --> 00:34:33,213
That's my day job.

421
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:38,584
Who are you?

422
00:34:39,424 --> 00:34:41,289
Amanda never talked about her family?

423
00:34:42,628 --> 00:34:45,825
She said she had a brother in Central City.

424
00:34:46,098 --> 00:34:48,931
He was in prison. She was the only person
who kept in touch.

425
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:50,864
She was my lifeline when I was inside.

426
00:34:51,036 --> 00:34:53,300
I never had a rich daddy
to keep me out of jail.

427
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:56,969
-I don't understand. What do you want?
-What do I want? What do I want?

428
00:34:57,142 --> 00:35:00,737
I want vengeance for my sister.

429
00:35:03,048 --> 00:35:05,573
What do you mean? Where's Amanda?

430
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:07,878
She's dead, Lex.

431
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:10,078
She committed suicide a year ago.

432
00:35:13,091 --> 00:35:16,322
-I never knew.
-That's because you cut her out of your life.

433
00:35:17,162 --> 00:35:21,326
She was never the same after Club Zero.
Jude's death devastated her.

434
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,527
He was the love of her life.
You took all that away.

435
00:35:26,305 --> 00:35:28,330
She had nothing to live for.

436
00:35:31,276 --> 00:35:33,073
Who's that?

437
00:35:34,146 --> 00:35:36,273
Lucky break.

438
00:35:36,715 --> 00:35:40,515
Couple weeks after Amanda's funeral,
I walk into a greasy spoon in Bludhaven...

439
00:35:40,686 --> 00:35:44,520
...and there he is. I couldn't believe it.
Short-order cook flipping burgers.

440
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:49,593
You know how they say everyone in life
has a double? I had to look twice.

441
00:35:50,295 --> 00:35:54,288
I figure if he can fool me, he can fool you.

442
00:35:56,935 --> 00:35:58,368
Why'd he do it?

443
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:02,804
He was on parole, needed the money,
and that's when I got the idea.

444
00:36:02,975 --> 00:36:07,105
You ruined Mandy's life, I'd ruin yours.

445
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:10,612
Mandy's finally gonna get the justice
she deserves.

446
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:13,508
You were right.

447
00:36:14,453 --> 00:36:19,618
You were right. The newspapers,
the police reports, what I told Phelan.

448
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:23,792
They were all lies. You want the truth?
I'll give it to you.

449
00:36:58,697 --> 00:37:02,758
-No, no, no. You're twisting it again!
-That's what happened!

450
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:05,061
That's what happened.
Amanda pulled the trigger.

451
00:37:05,237 --> 00:37:07,603
She shot Jude.
I was just trying to protect her.

452
00:37:07,773 --> 00:37:09,035
I'm through with you, Lex!

453
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,107
Killing me won't bring Amanda back.

454
00:37:13,312 --> 00:37:16,577
-None of this can change what happened.
-I don't care.

455
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:18,875
After tonight,
you'll never hurt anyone else.

456
00:37:19,184 --> 00:37:21,675
You can't escape your past, Lex.

457
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:42,229
Lex!

458
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:44,466
Get down!
There's a man with a gun up there.

459
00:37:44,643 --> 00:37:47,134
Where? You mean that guy?

460
00:37:47,312 --> 00:37:50,975
-What happened?
-I have no idea.

461
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:53,413
How'd you find me here?

462
00:37:53,585 --> 00:37:55,348
With a little help from my friends.

463
00:38:24,616 --> 00:38:28,814
-So, what do you think?
-I'm definitely surprised.

464
00:38:28,987 --> 00:38:30,682
Me too.

465
00:38:31,056 --> 00:38:32,853
Where's Chloe?

466
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:36,454
She said she wanted to be
fashionably late.

467
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:40,955
I got this for you.

468
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,091
Don't worry, it's not a body part.

469
00:38:45,904 --> 00:38:48,236
It was in the attic.
It was my grandfather's.

470
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:51,137
It was taken just after the Talon opened.

471
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:56,447
-Figured you could hang it above the counter.
-Clark, it's amazing. Thank you.

472
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:59,145
You're welcome.

473
00:39:00,385 --> 00:39:02,785
I better get back to work.

474
00:39:03,321 --> 00:39:05,255
How does it feel?

475
00:39:05,524 --> 00:39:10,291
-Terrifying. Don't tell anybody.
-Your secret's safe with me.

476
00:39:21,606 --> 00:39:23,938
I get the feeling you're avoiding me, Clark.

477
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:27,911
I just realized there's a lot
I don't know about you.

478
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,479
You think my dark past
is gonna rub off on you?

479
00:39:33,652 --> 00:39:35,882
I was trying to protect Amanda.

480
00:39:36,054 --> 00:39:37,885
My father wouldn't
raise a finger to help her...

481
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:40,115
...but I knew he'd do anything
to save his only son.

482
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:43,687
So you took the fall
and everything was covered up?

483
00:39:44,129 --> 00:39:47,189
Is that really what happened?
Is it the truth?

484
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,336
The truth is, I'd do anything
to protect my friends.

485
00:41:12,517 --> 00:41:13,506
