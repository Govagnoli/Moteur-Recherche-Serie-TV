1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,465
Let's have a look.

2
00:00:38,064 --> 00:00:39,395
You're a new man.

3
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,600
Like looking at a stranger.

4
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:45,599
Wasn't that the idea?

5
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:50,068
Throat hurts.

6
00:00:50,443 --> 00:00:53,970
You'll feel better when the swelling
in your vocal cords goes down.

7
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:02,444
Personally, I think society
places too much emphasis on looks.

8
00:01:02,622 --> 00:01:05,318
It should be the character
of a man that counts.

9
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:07,588
Don't you agree...

10
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,350
...Mr. Edge?

11
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:14,154
I think you have me
confused with someone else.

12
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:19,168
You can change your face,
your hair, your voice...

13
00:01:19,338 --> 00:01:22,068
...but not your DNA.
You still sweat the same.

14
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,239
I don't walk out of here
in five minutes...

15
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,884
...my people have orders
to send the police...

16
00:01:33,786 --> 00:01:38,553
...and inform my father that you
didn't die on the docks that day.

17
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,389
Maybe he'll send somebody
to finish the job.

18
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:51,493
What do you want?

19
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:54,799
When you and my father
were teenagers...

20
00:01:54,974 --> 00:01:58,000
...you conspired to kill my grandparents...

21
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:02,674
...and split the insurance money.

22
00:02:03,516 --> 00:02:05,677
You on something, Lex?

23
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:09,184
-Because, frankly, you sound delusional.
-No, I've got evidence...

24
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:11,653
...but I need hard proof
to bring down my father.

25
00:02:14,894 --> 00:02:18,694
You tell the whole story,
he goes to prison.

26
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:22,128
And maybe you can get a new life
to go along with the face.

27
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:29,441
I blow the building.

28
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:34,171
Lionel gets rid of his bastard father
and his gin-soaked mother.

29
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:37,783
The slum lord splits
the insurance payment with us.

30
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:41,480
Lionel uses his cut for his first start-up.

31
00:02:41,654 --> 00:02:43,588
And the rest is history.

32
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:49,260
Sorry for the interruption, sir,
but your father called again.

33
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:51,692
I did what you asked.
I told him you weren't here.

34
00:02:51,864 --> 00:02:53,889
You look worried, Darius.

35
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:55,533
Relax.

36
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:47,383
Darius!

37
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:31,312
Lex?

38
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:34,049
Are you alone?

39
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:36,126
Yeah. What happened to you?

40
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:40,522
Somebody tried to kill me last night.

41
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:43,559
Let's get you to a hospital,
call the police.

42
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:45,431
No hospitals, no police.

43
00:05:45,905 --> 00:05:47,998
These people are professionals.

44
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:51,208
They killed my security guard, Darius.

45
00:05:51,844 --> 00:05:53,573
They tried to finish me off too.

46
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:57,109
I just need time to think.

47
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:02,619
-Who would want to kill you?
-The less you know, the better.

48
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:06,087
Lex, I can't help you if you
don't tell me what's going on.

49
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,822
It was probably my father.

50
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:15,497
You guys have had your problems,
but you really think he'd try to kill you?

51
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:18,796
-lt was either him or Morgan Edge.
-Morgan Edge.

52
00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:24,874
Isn't he the crime boss I read was killed
in a shootout a few months ago?

53
00:06:25,444 --> 00:06:27,639
He survived, went underground.

54
00:06:27,813 --> 00:06:31,271
Got some hack plastic surgeon
to change his appearance.

55
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,150
What does he have against you?

56
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:37,412
I have evidence
linking him and my father...

57
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,024
...to a crime that can
get them the death penalty.

58
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:43,127
That evidence was supposed to be
delivered to the U.S. Attorney.

59
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:45,229
Clark, is that you?

60
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:49,265
But it's in my safe, Clark,
and I can't go back there.

61
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,603
Clark?

62
00:06:54,473 --> 00:06:56,202
I thought I heard somebody up here.

63
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,833
Since you're up with the cows, why
don't you give me a hand with milking?

64
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:02,981
Sorry, Dad, I got some
last-minute cramming to do.

65
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:04,581
All right.

66
00:07:04,984 --> 00:07:07,316
But I expect you to get an A.

67
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,686
Yes, sir.

68
00:07:17,696 --> 00:07:19,789
All right, I'll go get what's in your safe.

69
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:21,455
No. It's too dangerous, Clark.

70
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:25,092
-My people could be in on this.
-lf anyone asks, I'll just play dumb...

71
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:27,501
...tell them I was there to meet you.

72
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:30,005
Tell me exactly what happened.

73
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:30,232
Mr. Kent.

74
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,070
Can I help you?

75
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:35,172
I'm here to see Lex.

76
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:37,366
Most of the household is still asleep.

77
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,902
Is Darius on duty?

78
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:42,805
He had the night off.

79
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:45,040
You got stuck with the graveyard shift.

80
00:08:50,055 --> 00:08:51,488
What a bummer.

81
00:08:54,526 --> 00:08:56,084
Anything unusual happen?

82
00:08:57,429 --> 00:08:58,919
Not until you arrived.

83
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:02,927
Right. Well, I know
how to take a hint, so....

84
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,069
Tell Darius I was asking for him.

85
00:09:23,122 --> 00:09:25,886
I'm telling you, Lex, it's like
being in The Twilight Zone.

86
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:27,389
There was nothing wrong.

87
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:30,221
I didn't imagine getting shot at, Clark.

88
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:32,830
They must've had cleaners
to cover their tracks.

89
00:09:33,132 --> 00:09:36,499
Yeah, well, they missed a spot.
I found this in the hallway.

90
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:40,700
I called Darius' house to see
if anyone knew he was missing.

91
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:45,333
But according to his answering machine, his
wife and kids are visiting their grandparents.

92
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:49,038
Darius is probably at the bottom
of Crater Lake by now.

93
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:53,642
Maybe we should call the U.S. Attorney.

94
00:09:54,753 --> 00:09:56,186
Tell him what?

95
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,484
He was nervous about...

96
00:09:58,657 --> 00:10:01,683
...going after someone as powerful
as Lionel Luthor to begin with.

97
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,318
I don't think he'll be issuing
warrants based on a shard of glass.

98
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:08,623
Is there anyone who can
corroborate any part of your story?

99
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:12,970
Well, is Lex all right?

100
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:15,566
He's freaked out.

101
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,107
Pretty shaken up, but he's alive.

102
00:10:18,277 --> 00:10:20,438
How'd you get mixed up in this?

103
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:24,548
I was-- I was just researching
Lionel Luthor for a story.

104
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:28,379
I found out that he ran
with a pretty tough crowd as a kid.

105
00:10:28,887 --> 00:10:30,184
Morgan Edge?

106
00:10:30,556 --> 00:10:33,719
Yeah, I thought Lex would be
interested, but I had no idea...

107
00:10:33,892 --> 00:10:38,124
...he'd develop this theory that Edge
and Lionel murdered his grandparents.

108
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,292
Chloe, these people are dangerous.

109
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:41,831
They could come after you too.

110
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,366
Lex and I both agree
you should stay out of sight.

111
00:10:44,536 --> 00:10:46,970
No. Nobody who knows
anything about this is safe.

112
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:49,573
Not until whoever's
responsible is exposed.

113
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:52,801
I'm not gonna leave you alone.
Grab your laptop, and let's go.

114
00:11:16,101 --> 00:11:17,398
Hello, Clark.

115
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,937
-Miss Sullivan, isn't it?
-Yeah.

116
00:11:23,842 --> 00:11:27,039
Clark, Mr. Luthor has something
he'd like to talk to you about.

117
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:29,009
I'm afraid it's serious.

118
00:11:30,015 --> 00:11:32,540
Have you seen Lex, Clark?

119
00:11:35,354 --> 00:11:37,948
-Not for a few days.
-Lex is missing.

120
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:39,681
It's important that I find him.

121
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:42,485
Mr. Luthor, I know Lex pretty well.

122
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:46,097
If he wanted you to know
where he was, you probably would.

123
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,696
Lex is seriously ill.

124
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,303
He needs help.

125
00:11:53,472 --> 00:11:54,700
What do you mean, ill?

126
00:11:56,642 --> 00:11:59,941
There's a psychotic break.
Lex has had a psychotic break.

127
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,712
That can't be right.

128
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:07,377
It happened while he was on that island.

129
00:12:07,553 --> 00:12:09,748
I thought he'd beaten it...

130
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:15,053
...but he's had a relapse.
He's suffering from paranoid delusions.

131
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:18,496
He's hearing voices.
He sees things that aren't there.

132
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:25,901
I want my son.
I want him back...

133
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:27,732
...the way he used to be.

134
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,306
If you hear from him, Clark,
you have to help me.

135
00:12:32,477 --> 00:12:35,139
We have to get him the care he needs.

136
00:13:10,182 --> 00:13:11,979
Lex, what are you doing down here?

137
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:15,912
I had to get the baby.
He was crying.

138
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:18,786
My father woke him.

139
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:21,124
The baby?

140
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,186
What baby?

141
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:36,331
My little brother Julian.

142
00:13:45,017 --> 00:13:46,848
Lex--

143
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,151
He's asleep.

144
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:13,469
And the baby was a figment
of Lex's imagination?

145
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,772
He did have a little brother
named Julian.

146
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:18,279
He died as an infant
when Lex was still a kid.

147
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,384
That must've been traumatic for him.

148
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,654
Anyway, Chloe's with him now...

149
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,790
...and he seems perfectly fine.

150
00:14:26,692 --> 00:14:29,661
I don't get it. One second,
he's thinking he's holding a baby...

151
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,921
...and the next, he's
making complete sense.

152
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:35,555
I don't understand how you could
hide him in our barn without telling us.

153
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:39,295
Dad, he was scared. And he thinks
Lionel's trying to kill him.

154
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:43,431
-He said Morgan Edge is still alive.
-Morgan Edge.

155
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:45,466
He's involved.

156
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:49,872
Morgan Edge knows about your abilities.
He knows that kryptonite can kill you.

157
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:51,879
How could you not tell us that?

158
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:55,116
-There's more.
-More?

159
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,015
He said Morgan Edge
has had plastic surgery.

160
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,785
Even if he showed up,
we wouldn't know it was him.

161
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:06,228
So Morgan Edge is alive,
and he's had plastic surgery.

162
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:11,802
Clark, don't you think that that sounds like
another one of Lex's delusions? Come on.

163
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:15,636
I know how hard it is for you
to see Lex in this condition...

164
00:15:15,807 --> 00:15:18,503
...but he needs psychiatric care.

165
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:29,485
You think you know people...

166
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:32,179
...and you realize it's all just a facade.

167
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,957
Lex, you know we only want
what's best for you.

168
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,260
Save the cloying maternal posturing
for your own son, Mrs. Kent.

169
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:41,126
I heard you all talking.

170
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:46,261
Little Kent cabal...

171
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,740
...such a selective group, aren't you?
And so secretive.

172
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,275
Plotting to pack me off to the loony bin.

173
00:15:56,882 --> 00:15:58,713
I tried to stop him.

174
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:00,146
I'm sorry.

175
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,831
You're all watching me now?

176
00:16:16,802 --> 00:16:18,793
Lex, where are you going?

177
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,063
To find Morgan Edge
and prove I'm not crazy.

178
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:24,470
You're either with me or against me,
Clark. Choose right now.

179
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:28,374
Clark.

180
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:48,061
-Maybe you should wait in the car.
-No.

181
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:50,565
Lex, I've got your back.
That's why I'm here.

182
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,847
Lex, maybe this is the wrong place.

183
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,816
No. No, this was the place.

184
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:44,813
No, Edge was here.

185
00:17:45,323 --> 00:17:48,815
That was only yesterday. And these
people look like they've been here a while.

186
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:52,395
Don't you see?
It's part of the cover-up, Clark.

187
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,328
It wouldn't be that hard.

188
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,859
Bring in a few machines,
some immigrant labor.

189
00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:01,601
If you want to vanish,
why go through the trouble?

190
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:03,172
I don't know, Clark.

191
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:08,374
Lex....

192
00:18:08,747 --> 00:18:10,180
You gotta ask yourself...

193
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:14,208
...is there any possibility
you might be imagining all this?

194
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,054
Where's Morgan Edge?

195
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:21,692
Where's Edge?

196
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,852
Tell me where he is, or I'll stitch
this seam through your hand!

197
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,794
Lex, he doesn't understand
a word you're saying.

198
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:33,367
-Come on, let's go.
-All right, Clark, you win.

199
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,935
But I'm not imagining this, am l? Huh?

200
00:18:39,144 --> 00:18:41,738
-Let's go.
-Huh? Am I imagining this?

201
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:44,145
Go! Go!

202
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:45,779
Come on.

203
00:18:54,826 --> 00:18:56,885
There's gotta be more evidence.

204
00:18:57,062 --> 00:19:00,589
Maybe we should call the sheriff,
get her to bring in a forensics team.

205
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,597
What do you want to do, Lex?

206
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:08,738
Mr. Luthor.

207
00:19:11,142 --> 00:19:12,734
Darius.

208
00:19:17,215 --> 00:19:20,184
-You're alive.
-We were worried about you, sir.

209
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,357
You're in on this, aren't you?

210
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:29,220
In on what, sir?

211
00:19:31,196 --> 00:19:32,595
Lex.

212
00:19:37,502 --> 00:19:39,231
-Come on, Lex.
-Lex.

213
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,065
Thank God. We were looking
everywhere for you.

214
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:44,799
Did you call her?

215
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:48,674
-I don't even know who she is.
-She's my psychiatrist.

216
00:19:49,848 --> 00:19:53,579
Don't you think it's a little convenient
she just happens to be here?

217
00:19:53,752 --> 00:19:55,947
Security called me, Lex.

218
00:19:56,121 --> 00:19:57,452
You need to come with me.

219
00:19:57,622 --> 00:20:00,250
No. No, I'm not going anywhere.

220
00:20:00,425 --> 00:20:03,360
Somebody tried to kill me last night.
I jumped through a window!

221
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:05,723
Look, I have proof.

222
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:10,067
The window was broken.

223
00:20:11,436 --> 00:20:13,370
You got angry during our last session...

224
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:16,098
...and threw this vase
through the hall window.

225
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:24,638
I'm gonna give you something.

226
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:29,115
What is this? Huh?

227
00:20:29,454 --> 00:20:31,513
Some kind of hallucinogen?

228
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,555
It's a sedative.

229
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:35,884
No.

230
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:38,086
No, you're working for my father.

231
00:20:38,263 --> 00:20:42,131
-Drugging me to make me crazy.
-We need to get you to a hospital.

232
00:20:43,935 --> 00:20:46,631
All right, Mr. Luthor,
everything's gonna be fine.

233
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,832
It's gonna be all right.

234
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:54,375
Wait. Get on the ground!
Both of you, on the ground!

235
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:55,843
-Get on the ground!
-Lex.

236
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,412
-Lex, give me the gun.
-No, Clark.

237
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:04,451
If they take me to the hospital, I'll wind
up dead or drooling in a padded cell.

238
00:21:04,622 --> 00:21:08,114
-Why would they want to do that?
-It's a perfect plan, Clark.

239
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:10,694
If the world thinks I'm crazy...

240
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:14,423
...no one will believe what I found out
about my father and Morgan Edge!

241
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:20,762
-Think about it, Clark.
-Young man, your friend is very sick.

242
00:21:20,939 --> 00:21:24,773
These conspiracy theories
are a symptom of his condition.

243
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:26,467
Shut up!

244
00:21:29,314 --> 00:21:31,043
Maybe I am crazy, Clark.

245
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:35,779
I honestly don't know anymore.

246
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:39,949
But what if I'm right about all this?

247
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:44,187
Are you really just gonna
let them put me away?

248
00:22:01,813 --> 00:22:03,280
Hello?

249
00:22:04,382 --> 00:22:05,781
Are you here?

250
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,579
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

251
00:22:10,155 --> 00:22:12,988
I got your message.
I brought the food.

252
00:22:13,158 --> 00:22:15,956
Now tell me what I'm doing
here in the middle of the night.

253
00:22:26,004 --> 00:22:27,266
Lex.

254
00:22:29,841 --> 00:22:31,331
What's wrong?

255
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:34,672
There's a possibility he's being drugged.
People are after him.

256
00:22:34,846 --> 00:22:38,282
I couldn't bring him to the farm,
and I knew you knew this place.

257
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,881
Why didn't you tell me about this?

258
00:22:43,054 --> 00:22:45,887
Because if Lex is right,
everyone who's involved is in danger.

259
00:22:46,057 --> 00:22:49,493
And I promised myself I would never
put you in that position again.

260
00:22:50,428 --> 00:22:52,555
What exactly are we mixed up in?

261
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,992
I wish I knew.

262
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,931
I need you to stay with him.

263
00:23:00,405 --> 00:23:01,667
Where are you going?

264
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,968
I gotta get some evidence to Chloe
that may prove that he's being drugged.

265
00:23:05,143 --> 00:23:08,112
She couldn't come here because
we think she's being watched.

266
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:10,276
Don't worry, Lana.

267
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,412
I'll tell you everything.

268
00:23:14,552 --> 00:23:15,985
Be careful.

269
00:23:16,454 --> 00:23:18,217
He's not himself.

270
00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:19,651
Go.

271
00:23:36,107 --> 00:23:37,369
Hey.

272
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,033
-Thanks for meeting me out here.
-Of course.

273
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,577
Find out if this can
make someone hallucinate.

274
00:23:42,747 --> 00:23:44,977
I'll get it to my source
at the pharmacology lab.

275
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:48,277
I need to check out a Dr. Claire Foster
and the two security guards.

276
00:23:48,453 --> 00:23:54,016
-lf there's a conspiracy, they're likely in on it.
-I dug up some of Lex's medical records.

277
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:58,460
Apparently, this isn't the first time
he's had this kind of problem.

278
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,565
-What are you talking about?
-Well, after his brother died...

279
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,667
...Lex went right back
to boarding school.

280
00:24:03,835 --> 00:24:09,967
And soon after that, he started exhibiting
some pretty bizarro behavior.

281
00:24:10,141 --> 00:24:11,938
What do you mean, "bizarro"?

282
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,876
His housemaster found him sitting in
the bell tower in the middle of the night...

283
00:24:16,047 --> 00:24:18,607
...singing a lullaby
to a wrapped-up blanket.

284
00:24:21,452 --> 00:24:24,012
You know, I want to believe
that this is a conspiracy...

285
00:24:24,188 --> 00:24:26,952
...just as much as you do,
believe me...

286
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,593
...but I think we need
to start preparing ourselves...

287
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:32,628
...for the possibility
that Lex really is losing his mind.

288
00:24:40,204 --> 00:24:42,263
Thank you for coming, Lana.

289
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,578
I'm just glad you're letting me help.

290
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:01,548
What is this?

291
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,693
It's chamomile. It'll help you relax.

292
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,699
Liar.

293
00:25:11,202 --> 00:25:12,601
What?

294
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,032
Liar!

295
00:25:14,572 --> 00:25:17,166
-Lex, what's wrong?
-You're trying to drug me!

296
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:20,243
-I would never do that.
-I shouldn't have trusted you.

297
00:25:20,678 --> 00:25:23,112
-Lex, wait.
-Keep away from me!

298
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,632
Lana?

299
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:15,127
What's the trouble, mister?

300
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:54,601
You know, I was never quite sure which of
them was more out of touch with reality...

301
00:26:54,772 --> 00:26:58,299
...Don Quixote, jousting
with imaginary enemies...

302
00:26:58,476 --> 00:27:02,037
...or his loyal lackey Sancho Panza...

303
00:27:02,213 --> 00:27:07,515
...indulging his master's fantasies
in spite of the danger to everyone else.

304
00:27:07,685 --> 00:27:09,915
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

305
00:27:10,455 --> 00:27:12,446
I'm going to find Lex.

306
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,582
If I were you, I'd be careful.

307
00:27:16,394 --> 00:27:20,387
Lex is convinced you're responsible for
everything that's been happening to him.

308
00:27:20,565 --> 00:27:25,059
Well, I'm touched by your concern, but you
and I both know which of us is to blame.

309
00:27:25,236 --> 00:27:27,363
-Mr. Luthor, I don't think--
-No, no!

310
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:29,868
I don't want to hear it.

311
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:33,568
If you had listened to me, Lex would
already be getting the help he needs...

312
00:27:33,744 --> 00:27:36,713
...and Miss Lang wouldn't be here
fighting for her life.

313
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:38,871
Clark?

314
00:27:39,517 --> 00:27:41,178
Are you okay?

315
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:43,583
But don't worry about me.

316
00:27:43,754 --> 00:27:47,884
My security personnel
are well-equipped to protect me...

317
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:50,721
...and to find my son.

318
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:53,963
Now, I strongly suggest
the two of you go home...

319
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:56,692
...before you do any more damage.

320
00:27:58,936 --> 00:28:00,198
Miss Sullivan.

321
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,532
The drug analysis came back.

322
00:28:05,209 --> 00:28:07,541
It was just a common sedative.

323
00:28:19,257 --> 00:28:21,521
Lionel's right, Chloe.

324
00:28:21,692 --> 00:28:24,422
-I really screwed up.
-Maybe not.

325
00:28:24,595 --> 00:28:27,530
There are a lot of drugs that could
make Lex see pink elephants.

326
00:28:27,698 --> 00:28:30,758
Now, the question is,
how did it get into his system?

327
00:28:32,236 --> 00:28:35,763
The mansion. Everything's brought
to him there. The food, the drinks.

328
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,239
So for all we know, they
could've been dosing him for weeks.

329
00:28:42,446 --> 00:28:44,175
How'd you do it?

330
00:28:45,883 --> 00:28:48,681
-Do what?
-Get the drugs into Lex's system.

331
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:52,687
I don't appreciate some farm boy coming
in here and accusing me of a felony.

332
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,527
Don't underestimate farm boys.

333
00:28:56,694 --> 00:29:00,630
-Baling hay can make you pretty strong.
-Come on, you're gonna break my arm!

334
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:02,993
Not if you tell me
how you drugged Lex.

335
00:29:04,735 --> 00:29:06,066
It was the Scotch.

336
00:29:10,508 --> 00:29:13,807
-Tell me who you're working for!
-I don't know who they are, all right?

337
00:29:13,978 --> 00:29:16,242
-All I have is a cell phone number.
-Then call it.

338
00:29:16,414 --> 00:29:18,814
Tell them to be at the
Smallville Stables by noon...

339
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:21,383
...with a bag full of Benjamins
or I go to the cops.

340
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:24,646
Kid, you're crazy. These people
are not gonna pay you off.

341
00:29:24,822 --> 00:29:26,119
They're gonna kill you.

342
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:28,952
I'll take my chances.

343
00:29:34,165 --> 00:29:35,689
Thank you, Mike.

344
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,838
Lex. How'd you get in here, Lex?

345
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:51,642
When people think you're insane and
you're holding a rifle to their head...

346
00:29:51,816 --> 00:29:53,283
...they tend to do what you ask.

347
00:29:53,451 --> 00:29:57,080
Put the guns down, all right?
Sit down. Let's talk.

348
00:29:57,622 --> 00:29:59,681
Sure, Dad.

349
00:29:59,857 --> 00:30:02,189
We'll have a nice father-son chat.

350
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,588
All right, sit down.

351
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:07,094
About how you and Morgan Edge
killed my grandparents...

352
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:11,599
...and how you're drugging me
to make the world think I'm crazy.

353
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:14,966
Hey, why not do the whole thing
on Oprah, you know?

354
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:18,404
Spill our dysfunctional guts
on national TV like regular families do.

355
00:30:18,576 --> 00:30:20,601
All right, I understand why you're angry.

356
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:24,737
I found out the same thing. The slum
lord that owned my parents' tenement...

357
00:30:24,915 --> 00:30:28,078
...hired Edge to blow it up
for the insurance money.

358
00:30:28,252 --> 00:30:33,121
-Just like you planned it.
-No. Lex, no. Lex, no, they were parents.

359
00:30:33,357 --> 00:30:36,690
No matter how badly they treated me,
I would never hurt them.

360
00:30:36,861 --> 00:30:41,355
And I know deep down
you don't want to hurt me.

361
00:30:44,835 --> 00:30:48,396
-You know what disappoints me, Dad?
-All right, tell me.

362
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:51,205
You hired pros to kill me.

363
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:54,833
You always taught me, if you want
something done right, do it yourself.

364
00:30:55,012 --> 00:30:58,607
Lex, the person responsible
for this is Morgan Edge.

365
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,674
I know where he is.

366
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,649
Believe me, we can get justice. Lex.

367
00:31:05,122 --> 00:31:07,716
Lex! Listen to me.

368
00:31:07,892 --> 00:31:09,257
You'll wake the baby.

369
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:13,021
It's-- It's Julian.

370
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:18,027
-Are you seeing Julian again?
-You know I can't take it when he cries, Dad.

371
00:31:18,202 --> 00:31:19,931
Julian isn't here, Lex.
He's dead.

372
00:31:20,104 --> 00:31:21,833
-No!
-No, Lex.

373
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,167
You can't blame yourself
for the baby's death.

374
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:27,004
-Shut up!
-I know you didn't mean to hurt him. I know.

375
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:29,646
-Shut up!
-Lex, it was an accident, Lex.

376
00:31:29,814 --> 00:31:33,079
-Tell me where Morgan Edge is now!
-All right. All right.

377
00:31:37,655 --> 00:31:40,783
You have to be careful.
Lex, please.

378
00:31:41,392 --> 00:31:43,986
Be careful. Please, Lex.

379
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:51,433
I can't bear to lose another child.

380
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:07,851
Hello?

381
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:24,029
Tell me where to find the guy
you're working for or I keep squeezing.

382
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,064
Check it out.

383
00:33:08,546 --> 00:33:09,945
Jameson?

384
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:31,257
I gave you a chance, Edge,
but you really screwed it up.

385
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:34,968
-Now drop the gun.
-Your father's the one who screwed up.

386
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:39,040
If we'd done it my way,
you'd be dead by now.

387
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,507
What are you talking about?

388
00:33:40,678 --> 00:33:43,203
You think you could've escaped
if I wanted to kill you?

389
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,440
It was your father's idea
to make you look crazy instead.

390
00:33:46,617 --> 00:33:47,879
You're lying!

391
00:33:48,352 --> 00:33:50,343
It's true, Lex.

392
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:53,251
Lionel's gone soft in his old age.

393
00:33:53,591 --> 00:33:57,755
He was willing to lose his parents,
but he couldn't bear to lose another child.

394
00:33:58,229 --> 00:34:00,254
Neck still bothering you?

395
00:34:00,431 --> 00:34:02,490
Muscle aches, sleeplessness?

396
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,134
All common side effects of the drugs.

397
00:34:05,903 --> 00:34:07,871
I knew I wasn't crazy.

398
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:09,969
Tell me how you did it.

399
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:12,568
Lionel thought of everything.

400
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:19,215
First the dope, then getting the window
fixed, then setting up the sweatshop.

401
00:34:19,383 --> 00:34:23,149
All little details
to push you over the edge.

402
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,314
How do I know it wasn't all you?

403
00:34:25,556 --> 00:34:27,922
Well, take a look around you.

404
00:34:28,092 --> 00:34:32,051
You think I'd be in digs like this
if I hadn't cut a deal with your old man?

405
00:34:32,963 --> 00:34:37,297
You gotta admit, it was an elegant plan.
Just like when he was a kid.

406
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:42,202
Either you crack so completely
that you can't form a coherent sentence...

407
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:47,140
...or anything you say
sounds like the ravings of a madman.

408
00:34:49,847 --> 00:34:52,839
But he doesn't have to win, Lex.

409
00:34:54,318 --> 00:34:56,650
We can bring him down.

410
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,481
Together.

411
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,555
Maybe I'll just kill both of you.

412
00:35:10,968 --> 00:35:12,458
Hi, Kal.

413
00:35:13,103 --> 00:35:15,901
I had a feeling
we'd see each other again.

414
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:19,133
That's why I've been
carrying these around.

415
00:35:21,211 --> 00:35:24,578
-You know each other?
-We go way back.

416
00:35:26,216 --> 00:35:27,843
You're in on this too, Clark?

417
00:35:28,018 --> 00:35:30,077
-You're in on this too?
-No, Lex...

418
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:32,518
...it's not what you think.

419
00:35:57,481 --> 00:35:59,142
Thank you.

420
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,613
Don't thank me, Clark.

421
00:36:06,924 --> 00:36:08,721
You're part of this.

422
00:36:09,393 --> 00:36:11,054
I have to kill you too.

423
00:36:21,905 --> 00:36:25,238
You think you can just slither
away from me, Clark?

424
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,501
Lex, I'm your friend.

425
00:36:28,946 --> 00:36:31,210
I would never do anything to hurt you.

426
00:36:31,382 --> 00:36:34,010
What'd you do?
Did you betray Edge too?

427
00:36:34,885 --> 00:36:37,718
Is that why he beat you to a pulp?
Tell me, Clark!

428
00:36:37,888 --> 00:36:40,755
What's the price
of a Judas kiss these days?

429
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,672
I was right about you all along, Clark.

430
00:37:38,282 --> 00:37:40,147
You're not even human.

431
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:58,763
That car hit him at 80 miles an hour.

432
00:37:59,937 --> 00:38:02,701
And he tossed it like a toy.

433
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,238
Did you see him?

434
00:38:05,843 --> 00:38:07,140
See who?

435
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,378
No, no, no.

436
00:38:12,549 --> 00:38:14,073
He was right there.

437
00:38:21,058 --> 00:38:22,958
He was right there, I swear!

438
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:25,422
It's all right, Lex.

439
00:38:25,963 --> 00:38:27,760
We're gonna get you
the help you need.

440
00:38:31,969 --> 00:38:33,800
No. No.

441
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:36,398
He was right there.
Look at the car!

442
00:38:36,573 --> 00:38:39,167
Look at it! Look!

443
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,405
He was right there.

444
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:44,880
Clark!

445
00:38:55,993 --> 00:38:57,460
Hey.

446
00:39:00,998 --> 00:39:02,863
How's Lex?

447
00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:05,625
Lex isn't doing so good.

448
00:39:07,171 --> 00:39:08,695
I'm sorry.

449
00:39:09,573 --> 00:39:12,337
I know how much
you wanted to help him.

450
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:15,707
The doctors say that you're doing better.

451
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:21,108
I almost died, Clark.

452
00:39:23,687 --> 00:39:24,949
I know.

453
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:33,429
I always thought
you were being paranoid.

454
00:39:34,932 --> 00:39:36,365
About what?

455
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,769
That being around you is too dangerous.

456
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:43,395
But it's true.

457
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,131
-Lana--
-It's okay, Clark.

458
00:39:47,244 --> 00:39:48,575
I know.

459
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:51,606
You were only looking out for me.

460
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,683
But you're right...

461
00:39:55,252 --> 00:39:58,050
...I think I have to stay away from you.

462
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,647
Dr. Foster.

463
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:38,425
Good evening, Mr. Luthor.

464
00:40:39,763 --> 00:40:42,323
Why do these institutions always...

465
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:44,729
...stink of ammonia?

466
00:40:49,439 --> 00:40:50,906
How's Lex?

467
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:54,566
Now that he's here, I can
control his meds much more tightly.

468
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:59,011
By the time he finishes his treatment,
he won't have any short-term memory left.

469
00:41:00,284 --> 00:41:02,514
Wasn't that exactly what you wanted?

470
00:41:03,387 --> 00:41:07,881
Never believe for a second,
doctor, that this is what I wanted.

471
00:41:08,492 --> 00:41:11,017
I love my son more than life itself.

472
00:41:12,396 --> 00:41:14,364
But he leaves me no choice.

473
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
