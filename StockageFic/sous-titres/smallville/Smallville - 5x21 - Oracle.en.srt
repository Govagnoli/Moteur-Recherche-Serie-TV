1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,192
Mom?

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,678
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,114
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,590
We got you, didn't we?

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,238
Look. And Lois even made
her world-famous rum cake for you.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,674
From scratch.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,716
- Wow, I never would have guessed.
- You should have seen the first two.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,313
Come on, presents before cake.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,597
Come on, birthday boy. Sit down.

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,434
Open it.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,874
Wow.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,475
Not that you're
the "dear diary" <i>type...</i>

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,279
...but since you keep
everything to yourself...

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,998
...I thought it might help.

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,799
And since I'm on an intern budget,
I figured I could just...

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,349
...comp a couple of those IOUs
that you owe me.

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,553
Thank you.

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,233
That's Dad's handwriting.

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,359
I found it in his desk.

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,993
Two tickets to the Wolverines game
in Milwaukee.

21
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,956
- Right behind home plate.
- Yeah, your dad and his baseball.

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,430
There was no one in the world
he'd rather watch a game with.

23
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,029
Thanks for the tickets, Dad.

24
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,717
I just wish...

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,950
...that you were here to go with me.

26
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,154
Dad?

27
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,470
Listen, I'm sorry I couldn't be
at your birthday party...

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,551
...to see the kind of man
you're becoming.

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,472
- Dad, everything I am is because of you.
- Not everything.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,319
There can be no more lessons.

31
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,439
You're gonna have to do this
on your own. I can't help you anymore.

32
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,033
You're gonna have to stop him.

33
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,634
Stop who?

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,438
He's much worse
than we imagined.

35
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,033
So many people...

36
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,031
So many people are gonna die.

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,316
I don't understand.
What are you talking about?

38
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,590
I'm talking about Lionel Luthor.

39
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,234
What is he doing?

40
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,156
He's gonna do something terrible.

41
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,471
Tell me, Dad,
what am I supposed to do?

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,877
I'm sorry, clark.

43
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,315
But to save this world...

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,994
...you've gotta kill Lionel Luthor.

45
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,078
Goodbye, son.

46
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,199
Dad?

47
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,478
Dad?

48
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,512
Dad, wait.

49
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,276
Clark, grief can
play tricks on the mind.

50
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,998
Mom, I know what I saw.

51
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,311
It was Dad. His spirit, his ghost,
whatever you wanna call it.

52
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,278
Sweetheart, I see your dad
all the time.

53
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,749
Every morning when I wake up
I feel him beside me.

54
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,639
But it's not him.
And it's not his ghost.

55
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,792
It's my mind wanting it so badly
I think he's really there.

56
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,155
Right now you're really angry
with Lionel...

57
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,676
...and maybe you want someone
to say it's okay to get back at him.

58
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,876
Mom, this isn't the first time
I've seen Dad.

59
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,751
It's a long story,
but Lana was in trouble.

60
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,276
I tried to save her and had
some sort of near-death experience.

61
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,228
I saw Dad. He was the one
who told me Lionel knew my secret.

62
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,473
That wasn't my imagination.
What if this wasn't either?

63
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,993
If that's true,
if it really was your father...

64
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,633
Then what Lionel's up to is worse
than just knowing my secret.

65
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,476
It would have to be, for your father
to suggest taking someone's life.

66
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,551
One drip, one extra-hot double cap,
no foam.

67
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,472
- Sorry about the mess-up.
- Don't worry.

68
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,790
I know how finicky
that steamer can be.

69
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,679
- Thank you. Lois. Hey.
- Hey.

70
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,832
- Running a delivery service?
- No. Actually...

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,310
...Chloe started short-circuiting so l...
- Save it, Lana. It's okay.

72
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,278
There's only one extra-hot double cap,
no foam in this town.

73
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,759
Runs by "Lex."

74
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,480
Walks in here like he owns the place.

75
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,712
Actually, Lois, he does own the place.

76
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,313
So are you his new assistant?

77
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,800
No, not exactly.

78
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,838
No way.

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,275
I guess if you're in the market
for a boyfriend...

80
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,556
<i>...why</i> not Smallville's
most eligible bachelor?

81
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,672
He's not my boyfriend.

82
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,999
Look, I know I'm not versed
in the whole girl-talk thing...

83
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,071
...but I do have an unbiased ear.

84
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,233
And, I know what it's like
to have a case of the bad-boy blues.

85
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,477
Okay, Clark, I am the president
of Ghost Believers Anonymous...

86
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,679
...but your dad Hamleting you?
- Chloe, I know how it sounds.

87
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,118
- Hand me a cloak and call me Horatio.
- Great.

88
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,159
Now what could be so bad that my Dad
would want Lionel dead to stop it?

89
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,676
Maybe it has something to do with him
knowing where you really came from.

90
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,434
That's a part of it,
but there's gotta be something more.

91
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,033
Well...

92
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,191
...if Lionel is hatching
some evil scheme...

93
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,749
...it would explain why
he's sitting on your secret.

94
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,672
Maybe something's already in motion.

95
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,751
Chloe, someone tried
to blackmail my mom...

96
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,434
...with footage of me using my abilities.
- What?

97
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,511
Guess which billionaire
came to the rescue.

98
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,158
All right, say this ghost
of your dad's is right.

99
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,949
And we dig through Lionel's closet
and we find a smoking gun. Then what?

100
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,758
- Depends what it was.
- Would it?

101
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,435
Is there anything we could find that
would make Clark Kent kill someone?

102
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,869
My helicopter's waiting, Dad.
What's so important?

103
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,349
Obviously something
you've got cooking in Honduras.

104
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,715
Although I doubt
it's the banana daiquiris.

105
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,759
You've been racking up quite a lot
of frequent flier miles, son.

106
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,876
Challenging upper management
often leads to a bout of unemployment.

107
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,511
The welfare of your workers
is the least of my concerns.

108
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,637
You're involved with Milton Fine.

109
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,634
I know he's been smuggling the deadliest
viruses in the world into this country.

110
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,711
- With your help.
- Well, don't worry, Dad.

111
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,440
We're not gonna put them
in any Halloween candy.

112
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,349
You're extremely nonchalant for a man
whose collection of microorganisms...

113
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,909
...could wipe out
more than half of this country.

114
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,350
It's under control.

115
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,114
Your business partner's a man
who seems able to appear...

116
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,475
...at opposite ends
of the Earth simultaneously.

117
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,870
How much control
do you have over him?

118
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,110
Your intel is impressive,
but incomplete.

119
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,475
Shut the operation down, Lex.
Shut it down now.

120
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,996
Wherever you're incubating
these viruses, you need to destroy them.

121
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,590
Milton Fine embodies a threat
greater than you appear to realize.

122
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,911
You taught me. Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

123
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,311
This is one enemy you don't know.
Not knowing who you're in bed <i>with...</i>

124
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,153
...can make for a very
uncomfortable awakening.

125
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,910
Well, I'll present that nugget
to the board...

126
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,991
<i>...when</i> they ask why I'm late.

127
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,596
Wait, Clark, the alarm.

128
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,035
I cloned the transponder
from Lionel's key <i>port...</i>

129
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,555
...so we could override
the digital cipher.

130
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,917
I need a night life.

131
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,276
Look for anything my dad
might warn me about.

132
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,759
Okay, it might take a minute.

133
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,310
I can't exactly search for a file
called "My evil scheme."

134
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,959
Have you thought that
if Lionel knows your secret...

135
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,872
...he might have told...

136
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,914
Lex?

137
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,559
Knowledge is power.
Lionel would never level the field.

138
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,392
I guess this is one rare time...

139
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,791
...when we have to put our faith
in the Luthor family dysfunction.

140
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,556
- Locked out.
- Check his calendar.

141
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,870
All right.
I'm multitasking as fast as I can.

142
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,515
- Leon Rowland?
- Who's that?

143
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,197
Lionel has an interview tomorrow
with the <i>Inquisitor's</i> top reporter...

144
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,271
...regarding something
called "The Weapon."

145
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,438
Then at the Pentagon.

146
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,991
Looks like the mysterious weapon
is the hot topic this week.

147
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,798
Maybe it's not so mysterious.

148
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,034
Wait, you think that you might be
the weapon Lionel's talking about?

149
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,152
I bought us coffees.

150
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,790
But after a three-hour conversation
with Lois, they got a bit cold.

151
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,630
I can't wait to read all about Lex
and Lana in tomorrow's early edition.

152
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,233
She's not like that.

153
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,911
Believe it or not, she's a great listener.

154
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,991
And with everything
that's been going <i>on...</i>

155
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,957
...she's been a wonderful
outlet for me.

156
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,354
It looks like I'm not the only one
who needs an outlet.

157
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,554
Lana, something's happened.

158
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,117
I've been wrestling with whether or not
I should let you in on it.

159
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,952
But, when all is said and done...

160
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,112
...you're the one person in the world
I can share it with.

161
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,549
I've been working on something.

162
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,509
Something bigger than either of us.

163
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,074
- Lex, whatever it is, I trust you.
- This isn't about trusting me anymore.

164
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,435
It's about trusting you.

165
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,789
It's about how deep you wanna get
involved, and knowing when to say stop.

166
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,595
Lana, what I'm about to show <i>you...</i>

167
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,990
...means you're all in.

168
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,037
A hundred percent.

169
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,996
What is this place?

170
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,232
The future.

171
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,517
I'd like you to be by my side
when it arrives.

172
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,716
You've been collecting viruses?

173
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,518
The most deadly on the planet.

174
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,238
What are you gonna do with them?

175
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,232
Change the world.

176
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,392
Lana, we've been able to
alter the viruses...

177
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,635
...transforming them into
the ultimate vaccine.

178
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,514
One shot of this, and theoretically
you'd be <i>protected...</i>

179
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,796
...from any disease
that could be unleashed.

180
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,871
Unleashed?

181
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,473
By whom?

182
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,558
Well, according to Fine...

183
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,474
...the CIA believes the black spacecraft
might be the first of many.

184
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,154
Listen, you need to keep this
between the two of us.

185
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,709
Fine doesn't know
we're developing the vaccine here.

186
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,435
I thought you two
were working together.

187
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,079
Why don't you trust him anymore?

188
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,789
Because I think he might be reporting
back to something a little higher up.

189
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,992
You found the ship?

190
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,596
I was tracking Fine
and he led me directly to it.

191
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,751
But that's not the intriguing part.

192
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,957
These two photographs were taken
a hundredth of a second apart.

193
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,834
Where did he go?

194
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,639
Oh, my God.

195
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,234
Do you think he came out of that ship
like the others?

196
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,831
That's why I was
going along with him.

197
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,673
I thought I could buy some time
to find his weakness.

198
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,910
But I'm starting to think
he doesn't have one.

199
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,034
He might.

200
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,039
After the meteor shower, when I found
your dad in that strange trance...

201
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,397
...he grabbed me, and he told me
how to stop them.

202
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,350
<i>Hi, this is the Kent residence.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

203
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,235
<i>Martha, it's Lionel.</i>

204
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,719
<i>I know things are strained...</i>

205
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,838
<i>... but something's going on</i>
<i>that Clark needs to know about.</i>

206
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,356
<i>Please. Call me</i>
<i>as soon as you get this.</i>

207
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,397
Jonathan.

208
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,957
How long, Martha?

209
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,233
What?

210
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,914
How long have you had feelings
for Lionel Luthor?

211
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,718
It's not like that.

212
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,792
I want you to be happy, sweetheart.
I've always <i>just...</i>

213
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,553
Just wanted you to be happy...

214
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,476
...but not with him.

215
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,198
Jonathan.

216
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,269
You know you're the only man
I've ever loved.

217
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,717
It's <i>been...</i>

218
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,356
...so hard without you.

219
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,954
Your voice, your touch.

220
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,558
I miss you so much.

221
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,711
I miss you too, sweetheart.

222
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,870
Why did you have to leave me?

223
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,592
I'm sorry, Martha.
I didn't have any choice.

224
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,672
And soon, neither will a lot of other
innocent people.

225
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,236
Are you talking about Lionel?
What is it? What is he doing?

226
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,551
He's going to drown you all
in your own blood.

227
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,278
Just like he did me.

228
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,148
Like he did you? What...?

229
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,517
Martha, I'm sorry. But, you've got to
tell Clark there is no other choice.

230
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,828
Lionel Luthor has to die.

231
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,473
Jonathan.

232
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,632
He has to.

233
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,952
Jonathan?

234
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,958
He was standing right here.
Like he was still alive.

235
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,236
He said Lionel was gonna
drown us all in blood.

236
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,868
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

237
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,829
Mom, I think it might have something to
do with Lionel using me as a weapon.

238
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,150
But, Clark, you would never
go along with that.

239
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,958
What if he found a way
to control me?

240
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,917
Maybe that's what Dad's
come to stop.

241
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,472
All this time I thought Lionel
was making up for his past.

242
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,959
Mom, it's not your fault.

243
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,917
Lionel has been manipulating all of us.

244
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,874
Clark, he said something else.

245
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,995
I think he meant Lionel
had something to do with his death.

246
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,072
<i>We've tracked Milton Fine</i>
<i>to the Midwestern United States.</i>

247
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,959
<i>We're working to narrow</i>
<i>his coordinates. We'll let you know.</i>

248
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,790
<i>- Sir, please be advised unofficial data...</i>
- Good evening, Mr. Luthor.

249
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,437
May I?

250
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,035
Please, help yourself.

251
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,679
Everybody else does.

252
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,915
Some say the toast came about...

253
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,073
...by a man who feared
that his drink had been poisoned.

254
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,356
But he was a quick-witted man.

255
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,433
He joyfully clanked his mug
with the mugs of his mates...

256
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,798
...sloshing his lethal beverage
into everyone's drink with cheer.

257
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,153
A simple tap, then,
must be a sign of trust.

258
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,832
I'm not really thirsty.

259
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,959
I thought we had an agreement.

260
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,110
You would inform me
of the virus's progress.

261
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,875
But I seem to be
shockingly cut out of the loop.

262
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,474
A fact you've probably
known for weeks.

263
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,997
Come on.

264
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,754
You must have assumed
I wouldn't inherently <i>believe...</i>

265
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,194
...your CIA bluff.

266
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,548
And that's why I chose you.

267
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,393
For your insatiable distrust...

268
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,074
...and your propensity
for covering all the bases.

269
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,918
I'm sure you didn't waltz in <i>here...</i>

270
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,197
- ...thinking I'd just roll over.
- No, not you.

271
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,996
Not without a bone.

272
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,276
I'll take the truth.

273
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,994
I assure you the vaccine
is processed and ready.

274
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,669
But I'd be foolish to hand it over
to someone...

275
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,990
...whose agenda is still up for grabs.

276
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,953
Lex, it's a vaccine.

277
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,509
What threat could it possibly pose?

278
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,434
Now, that's a question
I've been asking myself for weeks.

279
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,513
I'm hoping this will help me
get a few answers.

280
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,595
Close...

281
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,352
<i>...but</i> I'm not one of them.

282
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,316
I was only made by them.

283
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,310
Where's the vaccine?

284
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,794
Before I tell you this,
promise you'll keep <i>cool...</i>

285
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,520
...and backburner those
<i>American Psycho</i> instincts, okay?

286
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,716
Chloe, what is it?

287
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,318
I pulled up your dad's phone records.

288
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,675
Unless Lionel was selling
long-distance plans...

289
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,035
...he was desperate
to get ahold of your dad.

290
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,034
There are at least 20 calls logged
in those last few weeks.

291
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,878
Dad said he died
protecting my secret.

292
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,838
Maybe that's how he found out
Lionel knew about me.

293
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,996
When did the calls stop?

294
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,792
They didn't.

295
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,793
Lionel talked to your dad
an hour before he died.

296
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,678
Think Lionel was congratulating him?

297
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,475
Not unless he did it in person.

298
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,029
Lionel's call came through a tower
in Jansen's Field.

299
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,191
That's only a mile away
from your house.

300
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,351
Lionel was there?

301
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,238
Lionel was there
the night my dad died.

302
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,034
Clark.

303
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,392
I'm glad you called. Thank you.
We don't have much time.

304
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,759
Is this where it happened?

305
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,635
Is this where you met my father
the night he died?

306
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,392
Yes. Yes, it is.

307
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,110
I had to talk to him. It was important.

308
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,311
He found out, didn't he?

309
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,593
He found out about your plan
to use me as a weapon.

310
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,034
A weapon?

311
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,749
No. Clark, no, it...

312
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,591
What did you do to him?

313
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,557
Clark, I wanted to help him.

314
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,393
He needed an ally
but he took it the wrong way.

315
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,556
- You killed my father.
- No. Clark...

316
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,995
What happened, he wouldn't
go along with the plan?

317
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,949
You pushed. You pushed him
till his heart gave out.

318
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,839
- Listen to me, Clark.
- I will never be anyone's weapon.

319
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,275
- You're not the weapon. It's not you.
- Lies.

320
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,710
That's all he's gonna tell you, son.

321
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,235
Gonna have to kill him
before he gets the chance.

322
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,834
- Listen to me, Clark.
- Shut up!

323
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,877
Do it, Clark.

324
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,911
Do it.

325
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,832
- You killed him.
- Yes, he killed me.

326
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,433
So go on, son. Avenge my death.

327
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,716
Your father would never
make you a murderer.

328
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,114
Kill him!

329
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,790
Listen to me, Clark. Listen to me.

330
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,235
Clark, I know this
is very difficult for you...

331
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,630
...but you have
got to kill Lionel Luthor!

332
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,951
Clark Kent, kill him now!

333
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,513
You know...

334
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,557
...I asked you to do one simple thing.

335
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,676
This is what I get.

336
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,472
You're a tremendous
disappointment to me, son.

337
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,712
You're not my father.

338
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,919
Well, it looks like I might have
underestimated you, Kal-EI. Catch!

339
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,912
It would be so easy to snap your neck
just like a twig.

340
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,435
But I still need you.

341
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,192
Who are you?

342
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,989
I'm the guy that's gonna help
bring this world to its knees.

343
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,394
Don't touch me.
Don't do it. Don't do...

344
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,318
What...? What just happened?

345
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,109
I was fairly certain Milton Fine
was a Kryptonian...

346
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,350
<i>...but</i> I didn't realize
that shape shifting...

347
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,034
<i>...was</i> one of the Kryptonian's
miraculous abilities.

348
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,633
It isn't.

349
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,719
Then Fine's not a Kryptonian.

350
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,949
Clark, it is important to both of us
that we keep this from Lex.

351
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,517
Look, Fine was created by Kryptonians,
and he's already been destroyed twice.

352
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,036
Twice? Some sort of self-replicating
entity, it's incredible.

353
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,668
That's one word for it.
Why was he so afraid of you?

354
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,238
And how were you able to destroy him,
just by touching him?

355
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,914
L... I'm not sure. But...

356
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,356
I feel the answers
could lie somewhere...

357
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,194
...in here.

358
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,476
Where did you find all this?

359
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,194
I didn't find it.

360
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,033
I wrote it.

361
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,838
And whatever voice I'm <i>channeling...</i>

362
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,232
...I believe that what I wrote
is meant for you.

363
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,669
So hell freezes over
and no one bothers to tell me?

364
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,434
Chloe, listen.
Mr. Luthor has been writing these.

365
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,273
Seems to be some sort of warning,
but I can't decipher it.

366
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,594
Unfortunately my Kryptonian's rusty.
What about...?

367
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,991
I don't know what any of this means.
I am simply the oracle.

368
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,313
The answers could be found
with a visit to your Fortress.

369
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,750
Last time someone talked me
into taking them...

370
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,117
...it was a trick to release General Zod.
- I have plans this weekend.

371
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,114
So if we could protect Smallville
from Krypton's deadliest villain, great.

372
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,192
Ancient hieroglyphics were deciphered
by finding repeated...

373
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,793
Repeated patterns. I know.

374
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,315
So let me scan this
and see if we got any.

375
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,117
Why would Fine wanna
expose himself now?

376
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,872
He's afraid I'm going to help you.

377
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,515
To stop what he and Lex
are planning to do.

378
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,716
- Which is what?
- Fine has been helping Lex...

379
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,749
...to develop a virus so lethal, it could
bring humanity to the brink of extinction.

380
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,593
LuthorCorp scientists
completed the project today.

381
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,309
So the weapon isn't clark,
it's this virus.

382
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,479
Yes.

383
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,756
What the pattern
is trying to warn me against.

384
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,549
I have a strong sense that this warning
I have been entrusted to pass on...

385
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,951
...is related to something more terrible
even than the virus.

386
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,593
- Maybe the virus is just a part of it.
- Yeah.

387
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,599
- Do you have access to the lab?
- I don't know where it is.

388
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,512
I think we know someone who does.

389
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,998
What are you doing?

390
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,479
Smooth one, Smallville.

391
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,834
- Something I have to talk to you about.
- How did you get in here?

392
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,879
I think I just heard a keg being tapped.
I'm gonna go check it out.

393
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,351
I shouldn't be going through
your stuff...

394
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,590
<i>...but</i> you're involved
in something dangerous.

395
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,990
Worried I'm involved in it,
or in it with Lex?

396
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,675
No. Lana, this has nothing to do
with my feelings.

397
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,752
Lex doesn't know what he's gotten
himself into. Neither do you.

398
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,832
You break into my place
and you expect me to believe anything?

399
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,639
Lex is in trouble.

400
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,190
And if you care about him at all,
you'll tell me where that lab is.

401
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,510
Before it's too late.

402
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,552
Impressive.

403
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,836
Looks like I underestimated
your willingness...

404
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,116
...to tackle a non-profit venture.

405
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,558
Well, Luthorcorp doesn't take the threat
of an alien Armageddon lightly.

406
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,716
You were never gonna create
a vaccine for humans, were you?

407
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,552
Is that what you think?

408
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,868
It was gonna be your way of protecting
extraterrestrial guests when they arrive...

409
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,190
...and unleash
some horrible disease on us.

410
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,194
So you went behind my back,
mass-produced the vaccine for mankind.

411
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,799
I wanted to give my people a chance
before you got your dirty hands on it.

412
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:23,592
I applaud your noble efforts
to protect your species.

413
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,318
Unfortunately, it's all based
on faulty assumptions.

414
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,679
I never intended
to mass-produce the vaccine.

415
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,109
One dose is all I ever needed.

416
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,312
Let the rest of the world
find its own cure.

417
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,791
I'm not sure
what to tell you, Mr. Luthor.

418
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,396
Whatever you were injected with,
it doesn't appear to have had any effect.

419
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,074
In fact, you've never been healthier.

420
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,789
Well, I appreciate the vote of confidence.
Thank you, doctor.

421
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,837
Are you okay?

422
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,318
Yeah.

423
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,913
So I'm guessing that my father told you
everything that happened at the lab.

424
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,192
You know, Lex, if you had listened
to your father's <i>warnings...</i>

425
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,796
...none of this would have happened.
- None of what?

426
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,837
All the viruses were destroyed.

427
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,390
And now LuthorCorp has a technology
to create an extraordinary vaccine.

428
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,752
Lex, you were double-crossed.

429
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,236
- Where's Fine right now?
- I don't know.

430
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,994
My operatives are scouring the globe.

431
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,596
Clark, I was the good guy here.

432
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,832
LuthorCorp spent over $ 10 million
producing that vaccine.

433
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,516
One more thing, Clark.

434
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,639
Lana called me.

435
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,560
I don't wanna hear you were
rifling through her stuff...

436
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,551
...like a crazy roommate again.

437
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,508
If you want something from me,
don't go running to Lana to find it.

438
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,710
You really crossed the line.

439
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,030
All those years we were friends...

440
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,357
...were you waiting for me to step aside
so you could make your move?

441
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,836
I don't know, clark.

442
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,433
All those years
you told Lana you loved her...

443
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,036
...were you just waiting to walk away
and break her heart?

444
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,837
There's a natural tendency to blame
the person who's replaced you.

445
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,399
I get that.

446
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,440
But I didn't take Lana from you.

447
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,400
You lost her all by yourself.

448
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,632
Lionel?

449
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,392
What are you doing here?

450
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,353
I have to make
a confession to you, Martha.

451
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,311
Martha, the...
The night Jonathan was elected...

452
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,631
...l... I called him.

453
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,432
So it's true.

454
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,754
I told him that I knew everything
about Clark.

455
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,199
He was so angry, he...

456
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,352
He never let me explain.

457
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,956
I wish I had a heart as full of strength
and goodness as your son, Martha.

458
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,710
I don't.

459
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,955
But I want you to remember
that I was at least honest with you.

460
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,310
In time, maybe you'll
be able to forgive me.

461
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,189
I'm sorry if things got awkward.

462
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,510
I was hoping Clark
wouldn't end up in all this.

463
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,389
- I just don't wanna hurt him.
- I don't either.

464
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,959
I care about him too.

465
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,909
But then I have to remind myself...

466
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,356
<i>...that</i> clark's specialty
is barging in where he's not <i>invited...</i>

467
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,832
...and then somehow making you feel
like you're the one who should apologize.

468
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,353
Okay, I have a great idea.

469
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,796
How about a moratorium
on the Clark topic?

470
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,238
Twist my arm.

471
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,391
Don't tempt me.

472
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,077
You know,
I still can't make sense of all this.

473
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,756
Why would you be asked to produce a
super vaccine just to have it destroyed?

474
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,913
I don't know.

475
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,958
But then again,
I think like a red-blooded human.

476
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,395
Well, he was obviously
preparing for something.

477
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,834
What happened?

478
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,034
What happened?

479
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,032
Are you okay?

480
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,038
Yeah.

481
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,236
Never better.

482
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,317
I thought you'd be outside Lana's dorm
with your binoculars by now.

483
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,198
I appreciate the concern.
Lana and I are none of your business.

484
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,638
Please, Smallville, I've had three exes
put under military surveillance.

485
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,078
I'm hardly qualified to dish out
post-relationship tact.

486
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,393
But it's time for some tough love.

487
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,033
Lana's going to move on.

488
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,790
She already has.

489
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,996
With Lex.

490
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,071
And it sucks.

491
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,993
But you gotta trust your gut
that you did this for a reason.

492
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,438
Whatever reasons guys have for dumping
hot, smart, fun girls these days.

493
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,197
Look, give her some space.
Your whole night-stalker routine...

494
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,352
...that is gonna ruin any of the
good feelings Lana has for you.

495
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,999
If there are any.

496
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,394
Look...

497
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,591
...sometimes you gotta tuck your
feelings away until it's the right time.

498
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,590
Like stuffing dollars into a piggy bank
for a bike you can't quite afford.

499
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,074
Except, I can't imagine
there is anyone else out there.

500
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,710
You never know, Clark. Maybe when you
finally crack open that piggy bank...

501
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,838
...you'll find that
you haven't been saving for a <i>bike...</i>

502
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,150
...you've really been saving
for a Harley.

503
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,957
There are times when I think
you don't know me at all.

504
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,069
Others where I think
you know me better than anyone.

505
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,236
Well, that's what I'm here for,
Smallville, one save at a time.

506
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,754
And speaking of saving things...

507
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,353
- My cake.
- Hello.

508
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,355
Your mom thought we might wanna
share some of the leftover birthday cake.

509
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,114
Well, I'm sure there's a goat on this farm
that will appreciate my knack for batter.

510
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,076
You handled the whole party
thing really well, by the way.

511
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,231
Thanks.

512
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,948
The baseball tickets...

513
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,758
...they hit me harder
than I thought.

514
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,918
Yeah, but those tickets,
they weren't your dad's only gift.

515
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,913
I mean, it didn't come with a big,
pretty red bow...

516
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,150
...but your dad raised you
to be your own man.

517
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,476
That was his real gift.

518
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,270
And he gave that to you every day.

519
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,154
I thought you just came
to get tipsy off of rum cake.

520
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,950
Yeah. Actually, I came by
for your Kryptonian dictionary.

521
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,316
I ran Lionel's symbols in that program
and it came up with this pattern.

522
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,278
Three signs repeated 32 times.

523
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,079
What does it say?

524
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,000
"Zod is coming."

525
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,231
