1
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,968
-It's been a long time since we've done this.
-Yeah.

2
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:38,212
Thought it'd be nice, you know? Something
to keep your mind off of....

3
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:41,215
It's okay, you can say it,
I'm not gonna break.

4
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,516
Sorry, I've just been kind of out of it lately.

5
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,658
I'm here if you need to talk.

6
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:49,719
There's one thing I wanted to ask you.

7
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:52,923
Would you be my date
to the spring formal?

8
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,167
Of course. You didn't have to ask.

9
00:00:57,036 --> 00:00:59,334
I guess I'm not taking anything
for granted anymore.

10
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:25,823
This is Watts and Vertigo, we have a gas fire
just off Route Twelve, mile marker 18.

11
00:01:31,437 --> 00:01:33,234
Whitney, look!

12
00:01:35,574 --> 00:01:37,337
-Hey!
-Hey!

13
00:01:38,043 --> 00:01:41,570
-Lana, get out of here. Run!
-Whitney, don't! Don't!

14
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:44,408
Look at the pipe!

15
00:01:45,985 --> 00:01:47,384
Everybody, clear on out!

16
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:51,080
Lana, get out of here! Go, run!

17
00:02:03,202 --> 00:02:04,726
-Lana!
-Get down!

18
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:25,821
Lana? Lana!

19
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:37,494
Hey, I just heard, is she all right?

20
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,798
Yeah. They gave her something
to help her rest.

21
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:42,974
How you holding up?

22
00:02:43,142 --> 00:02:46,339
Kind of hoped I'd seen my last
hospital room in a while.

23
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:49,246
Hey. Hey!

24
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:56,678
-I thought you'd be halfway to Metropolis.
-It's just an internship, I can reschedule.

25
00:02:56,855 --> 00:02:59,085
You've been waiting for that interview
for weeks.

26
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:01,624
I know, I just feel weird taking off right now.

27
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,452
Lana's gonna be okay.

28
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:05,426
It's just a mild concussion.

29
00:03:05,597 --> 00:03:10,261
<i>I'm crashing in my cousin's dorm. Call me
if anything goes wrong with the Torch.</i>

30
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:12,562
We can survive one day without you.

31
00:03:13,172 --> 00:03:14,662
You gonna wish me luck?

32
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:16,935
You don't need it.

33
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:20,872
-All right. Bye.
-Bye.

34
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:33,688
Can I buy you a coffee?

35
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:35,590
Yeah.

36
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:17,230
Chloe!

37
00:05:13,725 --> 00:05:17,092
Okay, well, I'll let you know. Bye.

38
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:20,129
-Who was that, the plumber?
-No, your school.

39
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:25,236
Don't worry. You're not in trouble. They're
looking for chaperones for the spring formal.

40
00:05:25,404 --> 00:05:28,999
-Oh, what'd you say?
-I said you hadn't even mentioned it.

41
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:31,608
I don't think the whole tux-and-limo thing
is for me.

42
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:35,975
-Besides, it's customary to have a date.
-It's customary to ask someone.

43
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:38,048
Martha, stay out of it.

44
00:05:38,217 --> 00:05:40,947
Son, can you get that trap
out of there for me?

45
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:43,087
Uh, sure, Dad.

46
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:48,821
Thank you.

47
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:52,358
So, are you planning on asking Chloe or not?

48
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:55,756
She just can't help herself.

49
00:05:55,934 --> 00:05:57,868
Don't use the sink until I
get back.

50
00:05:58,036 --> 00:06:00,971
-I'm not sure.
-Well, you said you had feelings for her.

51
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,471
It's not about Chloe.

52
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:07,408
You can't keep putting your life
on hold because of Lana.

53
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,977
But if she sees me with someone else,
it's like I'm saying the door's closed.

54
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,617
The door is closed, Clark.

55
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:16,717
You need to admit that to yourself.

56
00:06:19,858 --> 00:06:21,917
Hi, Lex, come on in.

57
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:25,862
Sorry to barge in. I came by
to see you and Mr. Kent.

58
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:28,158
Oh, I'll go get him.

59
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:31,666
-In a hurry?
-Yeah.

60
00:06:31,837 --> 00:06:35,705
<i>I'm taking over at the Torch while Chloe's
out of town. Catch up with you later.</i>

61
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:38,374
-Hi, Lex.
-Hey.

62
00:06:38,544 --> 00:06:40,102
What can I do for you?

63
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,407
The paperwork on the chemical spill
finally came through.

64
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:45,379
I never thought I'd see the day.

65
00:06:45,551 --> 00:06:49,612
Since the dumping wasn't done by an actual
LuthorCorp employee, it did require...

66
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:51,813
...jumping through some corporate hoops.

67
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:54,787
The accident was unfortunate.
I know your...

68
00:06:55,027 --> 00:06:57,325
...loss can't be fixed entirely
with money, but...

69
00:06:58,196 --> 00:07:00,187
...I hope this helps.

70
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:03,225
Well, I...

71
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:05,900
...appreciate the gesture, but....

72
00:07:06,505 --> 00:07:10,066
Hope we're not getting special treatment
because of your friendship with Clark.

73
00:07:10,242 --> 00:07:12,802
I assure you, Mr. Kent, that
has nothing to do with this.

74
00:07:12,978 --> 00:07:16,072
-This is very generous, Lex.
-Actually, it isn't.

75
00:07:16,248 --> 00:07:20,514
It reflects the exact value of the herd and
grazing land you lost. I wouldn't insult you...

76
00:07:20,686 --> 00:07:25,180
...by putting you in my debt. All I want is
to leave the doubt between us in the past.

77
00:07:40,305 --> 00:07:43,035
Hey. How you feeling?

78
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,200
Better. Now it only hurts
when I walk, sit, or breathe.

79
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:51,982
I'm surprised to see you. Usually a hospital
visit comes with a "get out of jail free" card.

80
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,411
Actually, I was looking for Chloe.

81
00:07:54,586 --> 00:07:56,986
Not here. She's in Metropolis until tonight.

82
00:07:57,556 --> 00:08:00,548
-You covering?
-Well, if you can call it that.

83
00:08:00,726 --> 00:08:05,493
The printer's jammed, the scanner's broken,
and the spring formal schedule is late.

84
00:08:05,664 --> 00:08:09,600
<i>Chloe leaves for a day and the Torch
goes down in flames.</i>

85
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:12,965
Safe to say we won't lose you to the
entrancing world of journalism.

86
00:08:14,306 --> 00:08:15,933
So have you talked to Chloe?

87
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:18,338
I left a message on her cell phone.

88
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:22,537
<i>I think she's busy convincing the Planet they
were insane ever to publish without her.</i>

89
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:25,811
What's up?

90
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:29,954
I had this intense dream about Chloe
I just can't shake.

91
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:34,022
It was totally surreal, but I dreamed she
was attacked outside of the hospital.

92
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:37,059
I know. It sounds crazy.

93
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:39,625
It's got you freaked.

94
00:08:40,265 --> 00:08:42,358
It's just, it felt like I was right there.

95
00:08:42,768 --> 00:08:47,330
She was walking to her car and getting her
keys out of that red bag with the butterflies.

96
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,639
What is it?

97
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:53,868
She was carrying that red bag
when she left the hospital.

98
00:08:55,814 --> 00:08:58,408
Do you want me to call her dad
to see if she's all right?

99
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:01,516
You know, I'm sure it's just the concussion.

100
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:04,383
Don't want to scare him because
I was on painkillers.

101
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:06,148
Yeah, it was probably a nightmare.

102
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:08,851
I'll see you later.

103
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:19,063
Lex?

104
00:09:19,604 --> 00:09:24,200
Since I didn't call you, and I haven't heard of
any three-headed sheep born in Smallville...

105
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:28,004
<i>-...what brings the Inquisitor here?
-We need to talk.</i>

106
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,080
I seriously doubt that.

107
00:09:30,248 --> 00:09:33,775
Seems you've given out gifts
to the competition.

108
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:36,279
Now, we had an arrangement.

109
00:09:36,455 --> 00:09:39,982
You give me stories, I give you information.

110
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:43,587
Now, what did Carrie Castle do for you
that I couldn't?

111
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,192
She gave me a pretty mean shiatsu massage.

112
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:52,265
Well, mock all you want, Lex.

113
00:09:52,437 --> 00:09:56,771
It just means I've had to take the initiative,
develop my own leads.

114
00:09:56,942 --> 00:10:00,378
There's a story here in Smallville,
and I am going to make my name on it.

115
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:05,241
I thought my position was clear.

116
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:10,081
I don't want you near the Kents. They're
off-limits, they're under my protection.

117
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:12,689
And what about the meteors?

118
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:15,588
-Are they under your protection?
-Do you have something?

119
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:20,327
I found a man who had a very
interesting view of the meteor shower.

120
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:24,094
Claims he saw something
fall out of the sky.

121
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:26,032
We all did.

122
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:28,604
Yeah, well, not like this.

123
00:10:31,843 --> 00:10:35,108
If you're feeling so abused,
why are you bringing this to me?

124
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,183
Getting the full story takes money
and access, and unlike some...

125
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:43,150
...I always hold up my end of the deal.

126
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:46,220
Get ready to thank me.

127
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:09,139
Hey, hey, Clark.

128
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:11,043
Take it easy, would you?

129
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:14,447
-Thing's been in our family a long time.
-Stupid thing won't start!

130
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:16,177
Clark.

131
00:11:16,354 --> 00:11:19,653
-What's going on, son?
-I'm worried.

132
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:25,229
I'm sure Chloe's going to call and you'll
realize you've been worried about nothing.

133
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:27,421
Yeah.

134
00:11:29,534 --> 00:11:31,468
I'm glad we'll finally be rid of this.

135
00:11:31,636 --> 00:11:34,070
We spend more time fixing it than riding it.

136
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:38,676
Well, I'm not sure that I'm quite
ready to retire the old girl yet.

137
00:11:38,844 --> 00:11:41,335
Well, with Lex's check
we can get a new one.

138
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,471
Actually, I haven't decided
to deposit that check.

139
00:11:44,716 --> 00:11:46,707
Dad, Lex is trying to do the right thing.

140
00:11:46,885 --> 00:11:48,853
I know he is, Clark. I know he didn't...

141
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,787
...try to buy me off. He's just trying to repay
for damages. You're right, I've got no real...

142
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:57,995
...reason to doubt him, it's just,
something in my gut tells me I should.

143
00:11:58,163 --> 00:12:01,223
Lex isn't perfect, Dad, I know that.

144
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,959
But slamming the door in his face
over and over...

145
00:12:04,135 --> 00:12:07,935
...only helps turn him into exactly
what you think he already is.

146
00:12:09,307 --> 00:12:11,741
When did you get to be so wise?

147
00:12:12,177 --> 00:12:14,077
Ask my dad.

148
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:15,677
I'll sleep on it.

149
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:23,950
Hey, Clark.

150
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:25,714
-Talked to Chloe yet?
-No...

151
00:12:25,891 --> 00:12:28,416
<i>...but the Planet better not have
turned her down.</i>

152
00:12:28,593 --> 00:12:30,720
Just thought she would have
called by now.

153
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:34,889
She probably already got the internship
and is out partying with her cousin.

154
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:36,761
So, did I mention...

155
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:40,393
-...l'm taking Erica Fox to the spring formal?
-Several times, yes.

156
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:44,565
The hottest girl in our class. Just
want to make sure that was clear.

157
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:47,803
-It is.
-So, want to know my secret? You do.

158
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:53,542
I asked her. You ought to try it. Getting up
off your butt. It's the wave of the future.

159
00:12:53,852 --> 00:12:57,344
I've gotta go reserve my limo
for the spring formal.

160
00:12:57,522 --> 00:13:01,117
To which, incidentally, I'm taking Erica Fox!

161
00:13:01,293 --> 00:13:03,022
I hadn't heard.

162
00:13:03,828 --> 00:13:05,523
Any word on our intrepid reporter?

163
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:08,393
I called her dad. He was stuck in a seminar.

164
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:11,500
-I'm sure she'll be okay.
-Yeah, me too.

165
00:13:13,438 --> 00:13:15,235
You can buy tickets to the formal here.

166
00:13:15,407 --> 00:13:17,534
-That's a cool idea.
-You ask anyone yet?

167
00:13:18,243 --> 00:13:19,642
I've got my eye on someone.

168
00:13:20,245 --> 00:13:24,045
Well, you'd better hurry up. No one
likes to look for a dress last minute.

169
00:13:26,318 --> 00:13:27,785
Not even Chloe.

170
00:13:28,853 --> 00:13:31,344
What makes you think I'm asking Chloe?

171
00:13:56,614 --> 00:13:57,979
Lana.

172
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:00,617
-It happened again.
-You saw something.

173
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:05,722
I saw Chloe. Somebody's got her.
You have to believe me, Clark.

174
00:14:13,431 --> 00:14:17,060
Come on, Chloe, come on.

175
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:22,068
You've been through worse than this.
Come on, Chloe. Okay, maybe you're lying.

176
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,032
Home sweet home.

177
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:12,289
Hey, guys. I called the sheriff's office
because I wanted them to hear this too.

178
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,287
Any luck reaching Chloe, Mr. Sullivan?

179
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:17,223
No, I haven't heard from her.
I'm starting to get concerned.

180
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:19,693
I called her cousin, but I get the machine.

181
00:15:19,864 --> 00:15:22,799
You said you had proof Chloe
might've been abducted?

182
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:24,457
Well, I sort of had a vision.

183
00:15:24,636 --> 00:15:26,331
A vision.

184
00:15:26,638 --> 00:15:28,037
She saw Chloe being kidnapped.

185
00:15:28,206 --> 00:15:31,403
Maybe you should have called the Psychic
Friends Network instead then.

186
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,602
What makes you think it was real?

187
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:36,212
I saw Chloe bound and blindfolded
in a dark room.

188
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:40,044
Well, too bad you didn't see something
a little more useful, like an address...

189
00:15:40,218 --> 00:15:41,845
...where we might find her.

190
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:45,086
-Excuse me.
-Ms. Lang...

191
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:47,520
...you went through a rough
ordeal yesterday.

192
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:50,183
Are you sure you're feeling okay?

193
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:52,591
You mean, do I think I'm hallucinating?

194
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:56,131
I felt like I was there, like I was seeing
through the kidnapper's eyes.

195
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:59,429
-We'll take this seriously, and look into it.
-Thanks.

196
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:03,271
Mr. Sullivan? What is it?

197
00:16:05,643 --> 00:16:08,271
They found Chloe's car.

198
00:16:08,446 --> 00:16:10,004
It's been abandoned in the woods.

199
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:35,532
So far, I'm unimpressed.

200
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:38,005
Reserve judgment for five minutes.

201
00:16:38,176 --> 00:16:40,144
-Starting now.
-Mr. Cole, this is--

202
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:43,280
Lex Luthor. I know who he is.

203
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:45,939
He's very interested in your story.

204
00:16:46,284 --> 00:16:49,117
12 years ago, Eddie had more clients
than he could handle.

205
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:53,118
Spent eight hours a day dusting fields
all over Smallville.

206
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,724
And then?

207
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:56,827
FAA pulled my license.

208
00:16:57,395 --> 00:16:59,022
And why would they do that?

209
00:16:59,197 --> 00:17:02,428
Decided I wasn't fit in the head
to fly anymore.

210
00:17:03,034 --> 00:17:05,798
Because I couldn't keep my dumb
mouth shut.

211
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:09,432
What were your rates for cropdusting,
Mr. Cole?

212
00:17:09,607 --> 00:17:11,734
600 a day.

213
00:17:14,612 --> 00:17:16,773
I'd very much like to hear your story.

214
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:26,384
I was up in my prop,
dusting the Bakers' field.

215
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:29,288
Fifty acres of sweet corn. When it happened.

216
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:31,395
The meteors?

217
00:17:31,563 --> 00:17:36,591
It was like lightning, all around.
Pretty sure I was going to die right there.

218
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:39,726
Then one...

219
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:44,132
...just missed my tail by about 10 feet.

220
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:49,640
I saw it go straight down, and then
swerve just before it hit.

221
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:55,013
Doesn't sound like a meteor.

222
00:17:56,754 --> 00:17:59,951
I know aircraft better than most.

223
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,651
The way that thing moved,
it had to be a ship.

224
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,654
You saw a ship crash?

225
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:11,700
Well, it's not just that I saw a ship crash.

226
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:16,499
Couple hours later, went to look for it.
It was gone.

227
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,072
Maybe it burned.

228
00:18:20,411 --> 00:18:22,971
Or maybe it was taken.

229
00:18:23,147 --> 00:18:24,808
Nobody believes me.

230
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:29,079
Gave Mr. Nixon a map of the crash site.

231
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:31,183
I've seen it.

232
00:18:32,757 --> 00:18:34,054
So you believe me?

233
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,591
It's a good story.

234
00:18:39,464 --> 00:18:40,897
Thanks for your time, Mr. Cole.

235
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:48,060
Hey!

236
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:51,436
Thought you'd be pleased. I brought
the story you've been waiting for.

237
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:54,134
You brought me a desperate man
and a tall tale.

238
00:18:54,312 --> 00:18:57,145
It's about what I expected from you.

239
00:18:57,315 --> 00:19:00,182
Sorry, Rog, time's up.

240
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:22,665
Any word on Chloe?

241
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:29,339
My dad and I went out with
Mr. Sullivan and the police.

242
00:19:29,847 --> 00:19:33,908
We searched the woods but
we didn't find anything.

243
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:37,621
They've organized a search party,
tomorrow morning.

244
00:19:39,924 --> 00:19:41,516
How you doing?

245
00:19:42,126 --> 00:19:45,721
Spent the afternoon at the sheriff's station
telling them what I saw.

246
00:19:45,897 --> 00:19:48,457
Kept looking at me like I was crazy.

247
00:19:51,035 --> 00:19:52,969
I don't think you're crazy.

248
00:19:56,941 --> 00:19:58,602
How are you holding up?

249
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:04,581
I keep wishing Chloe would just
walk up those steps.

250
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:09,445
I never appreciated how much
she meant to me until now.

251
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,612
-The thought of never seeing her again--
-Clark.

252
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,917
You can't think that way.

253
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:23,592
You know, I remember the first time
I met her.

254
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:25,360
It was eighth grade.

255
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:31,237
She'd just transferred from Metropolis
and I was assigned to show her around.

256
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:34,837
<i>She wanted to know where
she could buy a copy of the Planet...</i>

257
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:37,503
...so she could keep in touch
with civilization.

258
00:20:39,283 --> 00:20:44,653
When she found out I lived on a farm, she
insisted I invite her over to experience it.

259
00:20:44,822 --> 00:20:46,847
I think she thought I was Amish.

260
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:54,054
When I brought her up here...

261
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,635
...she just kissed me, right out of the blue.

262
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:00,534
Why'd she do that?

263
00:21:00,805 --> 00:21:03,137
She said, "I know you've been thinking
about that...

264
00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:05,969
...so I figured we'd get it out of the way
and be friends."

265
00:21:09,213 --> 00:21:11,443
It was my first kiss.

266
00:21:14,218 --> 00:21:17,551
It's nice it was with someone
you still care about.

267
00:21:23,094 --> 00:21:24,755
We're going to see her again, Clark.

268
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:45,679
Lana?

269
00:21:49,921 --> 00:21:52,856
-I just saw her again.
-Chloe? Where?

270
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:56,118
-Buried. She's still alive.
-Did you see where she was?

271
00:21:56,294 --> 00:21:58,626
I'm not sure, but there was
a windmill. A big one.

272
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:04,224
She must be out in Chandler's Field.
I'll get help!

273
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:48,574
Chloe? Chloe!

274
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:52,808
-Chloe, it's okay! It's okay.
-Clark!

275
00:22:53,618 --> 00:22:55,586
Clark.

276
00:22:55,753 --> 00:22:59,519
I knew it was you, it's always you.

277
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:12,826
Thanks, I appreciate that.

278
00:23:13,004 --> 00:23:15,996
I gotta go. Some real people
just came in.

279
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,276
-Who was that?
-The Daily Planet.

280
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:24,141
Thought you missed your appointment
for the internship.

281
00:23:24,315 --> 00:23:26,545
I did. They were calling about an interview.

282
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:29,744
Are you gonna do it?

283
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:33,756
<i>No. I've wanted my name in the
Daily Planet, but not like this.</i>

284
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:37,292
<i>Besides, I figured the Torch could
use an exclusive, which...</i>

285
00:23:37,461 --> 00:23:41,693
...I will write as soon as I get out of here.

286
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,068
Chloe, do you remember anything?

287
00:23:47,605 --> 00:23:49,971
I remember...

288
00:23:50,575 --> 00:23:52,475
...tripping on some metal rails...

289
00:23:53,911 --> 00:23:55,879
...and I remember...

290
00:23:56,314 --> 00:24:00,114
...hundreds of teddy bears
hanging from the ceiling.

291
00:24:01,252 --> 00:24:03,948
Anyway, that's where I was kept until l--

292
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:11,823
I'm sorry, you guys. Flashback.
I can still hear the dirt falling on the coffin.

293
00:24:11,996 --> 00:24:13,725
Sorry.

294
00:24:14,665 --> 00:24:17,634
If you hadn't found me,
I don't know where I'd be.

295
00:24:17,802 --> 00:24:19,599
Don't thank me, thank Lana.

296
00:24:21,072 --> 00:24:22,403
Yeah, I gotta hand it to you...

297
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:27,810
...you sure picked a perfect time to take
a walk on the weird side.

298
00:24:30,114 --> 00:24:31,809
You should get some rest.

299
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:33,740
Clark.

300
00:24:35,653 --> 00:24:37,644
Would you mind sticking around
for a while?

301
00:24:37,822 --> 00:24:39,790
Whoever did this is still out there.

302
00:24:40,725 --> 00:24:43,023
Of course not. I'll stay here
as long as you need.

303
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:45,994
Thanks.

304
00:24:48,366 --> 00:24:51,199
Okay, well, I guess I'll
see you guys tomorrow.

305
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:52,697
Bye, Lana.

306
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,634
-Okay.
-Bye.

307
00:25:38,949 --> 00:25:40,849
Glad you could join me.

308
00:25:41,018 --> 00:25:43,919
-How late were you at the hospital?
-All night.

309
00:25:44,088 --> 00:25:45,555
I snuck in after visiting hours.

310
00:25:45,756 --> 00:25:48,190
I'm sure Chloe appreciated that.

311
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:50,827
I'm worried that the person
who did this is out there.

312
00:25:50,995 --> 00:25:55,056
Clark, you got her back safe and sound.
That's what's important.

313
00:25:55,232 --> 00:25:56,756
Without Lana I wouldn't have.

314
00:25:56,934 --> 00:26:00,700
Hey, she hasn't had any more
visions, has she?

315
00:26:00,905 --> 00:26:06,366
No. I think they're connected to the gas
pipe explosion. That's when they started.

316
00:26:06,544 --> 00:26:12,505
-I'm gonna check that out.
-No, son, let the police do it. It's their job.

317
00:26:12,683 --> 00:26:16,380
-Wish I knew who she was seeing through.
-What you need to focus on right now...

318
00:26:16,554 --> 00:26:19,216
...is getting this truckload of feed
over to the Millers.

319
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,752
So you've had a night to sleep on it,
what are you going to do with Lex's check?

320
00:26:26,197 --> 00:26:28,062
I might be stubborn, but I'm not blind.

321
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:32,294
Yeah, I had a talk with your mom.

322
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,335
As soon as we deliver the feed...

323
00:26:34,505 --> 00:26:38,202
...l'm taking it to the savings and loan.

324
00:27:26,323 --> 00:27:28,814
-Keep them moving.
-All right.

325
00:27:29,293 --> 00:27:30,851
What's up, Lex?

326
00:27:31,162 --> 00:27:35,622
Considering buying this land for a project,
but I wanted to test the soil first.

327
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,131
Standard operating procedure.

328
00:27:37,301 --> 00:27:42,034
Since when does standard procedure
include metal detectors and HAZMAT suits?

329
00:27:43,174 --> 00:27:46,337
To be honest, there may have been
a major meteor strike on the site.

330
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:50,338
There's no proof the meteors
were harmful, but--

331
00:27:50,514 --> 00:27:54,575
It never hurts to dot your I's
and cross your T's, right?

332
00:27:55,419 --> 00:27:59,583
LuthorCorp's environmental record has
taken some serious hits in recent weeks.

333
00:27:59,757 --> 00:28:02,590
Better safe than sorry.
Is there a problem?

334
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,022
Dad?

335
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:06,591
The problem is, Lex, that...

336
00:28:06,831 --> 00:28:10,028
...what's good for LuthorCorp isn't always
what's good for this town.

337
00:28:10,234 --> 00:28:11,565
Mr. Luthor.

338
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:15,429
Looks like you've got business to attend to.

339
00:28:22,213 --> 00:28:24,738
I've decided I can't accept your money.

340
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:26,680
Mr. Kent, I don't understand.

341
00:28:30,154 --> 00:28:32,315
I wouldn't expect you would.

342
00:28:33,858 --> 00:28:35,826
-Lex, l--
-It's okay, Clark.

343
00:28:35,993 --> 00:28:37,551
I'll talk to you later.

344
00:28:43,701 --> 00:28:45,293
Dad.

345
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,765
Dad!

346
00:28:47,938 --> 00:28:51,237
Lex didn't deserve that.
People test the land all the time.

347
00:28:51,408 --> 00:28:52,932
I know that, Clark.

348
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,806
But this field is where your ship
crashed down.

349
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,677
If Lex's scientists find anything out here,
they could trace it back to you.

350
00:28:59,884 --> 00:29:02,910
Keep swinging the detector through
until we get a reading.

351
00:29:03,087 --> 00:29:04,554
Come on.

352
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:11,250
Lex, you gotta see this.

353
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,570
You understand what this could mean.

354
00:29:23,807 --> 00:29:25,468
More than you know.

355
00:29:27,111 --> 00:29:30,979
I want you to handle all the tests
personally, then report directly to me.

356
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,931
-How you feeling?
-Better.

357
00:29:55,105 --> 00:29:57,300
At least the nightmares
seem to have stopped.

358
00:29:57,474 --> 00:29:58,736
I'm glad you came by.

359
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:03,608
Went home early. Started going through
some of my dad's things.

360
00:30:03,781 --> 00:30:06,944
-Sure you're ready for that?
-It's okay.

361
00:30:07,284 --> 00:30:10,253
It actually brought back
some nice memories.

362
00:30:10,754 --> 00:30:12,312
And I found this.

363
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:23,024
These were your father's?

364
00:30:23,634 --> 00:30:25,124
Yeah.

365
00:30:25,436 --> 00:30:28,132
I knew he served in Vietnam,
but he never talked about it.

366
00:30:28,305 --> 00:30:29,533
Know what they're for?

367
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,166
Yeah. They keep a registry on the Internet.

368
00:30:33,344 --> 00:30:35,471
Silver star's for exceptional valor.

369
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:39,473
He rescued three men in his unit
during a firefight.

370
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,551
He was wounded, but he
wouldn't leave his men behind.

371
00:30:43,153 --> 00:30:45,348
Sounds like your dad.

372
00:30:45,522 --> 00:30:47,046
Wonder why he never told you.

373
00:30:48,225 --> 00:30:50,284
Maybe he just did.

374
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:52,929
You know...

375
00:30:53,097 --> 00:30:58,467
...you win a couple football games
and people start calling you a hero.

376
00:30:58,635 --> 00:31:00,933
It feels good, but...

377
00:31:01,672 --> 00:31:06,405
...maybe he's trying to tell me throwing a
ball isn't the only thing important in life.

378
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,557
Glad to see I'm not the only one
who's curious in Smallville.

379
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,460
Hey, Lex. What are you doing here?

380
00:31:29,633 --> 00:31:33,000
I feel like I owe your father an apology,
but I'm not exactly sure why.

381
00:31:34,104 --> 00:31:35,969
It's not you. It's everything.

382
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,165
Money problems, the farm.

383
00:31:38,342 --> 00:31:41,072
He didn't understand what you
were doing in that field.

384
00:31:41,245 --> 00:31:42,769
I thought I made myself clear.

385
00:31:43,847 --> 00:31:45,246
You did.

386
00:31:47,451 --> 00:31:50,352
You don't believe me either.

387
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:54,287
I know you get obsessed about things,
like the car accident.

388
00:31:54,992 --> 00:31:58,450
I find it hard to believe you'd waste time
supervising a land survey...

389
00:31:58,629 --> 00:32:00,187
...if that's what it was.

390
00:32:01,598 --> 00:32:04,294
My life changed when the meteors hit,
I need to know why.

391
00:32:04,468 --> 00:32:05,696
Can't let it go?

392
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:09,032
This isn't some empty emotional quest.
It's about finding the truth.

393
00:32:09,206 --> 00:32:10,764
The truth.

394
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:14,535
I found a man.

395
00:32:15,112 --> 00:32:18,081
He said something besides the meteors
came down that day.

396
00:32:19,016 --> 00:32:20,950
Like what?

397
00:32:21,552 --> 00:32:23,247
A ship.

398
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:27,386
And you believe him.

399
00:32:28,092 --> 00:32:29,354
I listened.

400
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,760
Chances are he's another crackpot,
but I'd be remiss if I didn't check it out.

401
00:32:34,665 --> 00:32:37,429
And when the next story crops up,
you'll check that one too.

402
00:32:38,469 --> 00:32:40,596
When are you going to put
your past behind you?

403
00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:44,598
You look at the stars, Clark.

404
00:32:44,775 --> 00:32:48,142
Some of them have been extinguished
for thousands of years...

405
00:32:48,312 --> 00:32:51,213
...but their light is only reaching us now.

406
00:32:51,782 --> 00:32:54,910
Past is always influencing the present.

407
00:32:55,085 --> 00:32:57,280
I can't change that.

408
00:32:57,454 --> 00:33:00,116
All I can do is try to understand it.

409
00:33:06,663 --> 00:33:08,654
Chloe, why aren't you at home sleeping?

410
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:12,461
If I fall asleep, I'll have nightmares,
so I figure the best thing is keep busy.

411
00:33:12,636 --> 00:33:14,831
God knows you left a mess
for me to clean up.

412
00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:17,030
Well, I'm glad you're here.

413
00:33:17,207 --> 00:33:20,176
Hey, Whitney.
You sure you're in the right place?

414
00:33:20,344 --> 00:33:23,040
Clark called, said he needed my help.

415
00:33:23,213 --> 00:33:25,909
I figured out how Lana got her visions.
The explosion.

416
00:33:26,316 --> 00:33:27,908
You think the blast caused them?

417
00:33:28,085 --> 00:33:30,815
More than that. It connected her
with someone.

418
00:33:30,988 --> 00:33:34,719
Clark Kent leaps tall theories in a single
bound. How did you arrive at this one?

419
00:33:34,892 --> 00:33:37,588
Apparently there were meteor rocks
at the explosion...

420
00:33:37,761 --> 00:33:39,922
...and I found this article.

421
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:44,898
The De Kretser Syndrome?

422
00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:47,437
It's like a post-traumatic
stress disorder.

423
00:33:47,604 --> 00:33:49,902
There were cases reported
during the London blitz.

424
00:33:50,073 --> 00:33:55,511
People in shelters would find themselves
psychically linked after a bomb hit nearby.

425
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:57,041
I'm sold.

426
00:33:57,214 --> 00:34:02,174
According to this, it's in times of stress,
anger, or excitement that triggers visions.

427
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:04,616
Who was around Lana after the explosion?

428
00:34:04,855 --> 00:34:07,380
Myself and two deputies.
Watts and Vertigo.

429
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:10,391
They were with your dad when
we told them about Lana's vision.

430
00:34:10,561 --> 00:34:13,962
He probably called them himself.
They're in a bowling league together.

431
00:34:14,131 --> 00:34:16,190
Whitney, which one got to her first?

432
00:34:16,366 --> 00:34:18,800
It's tough to say, it all happened so fast.

433
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:20,766
One of these cops kidnapped Chloe?

434
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:23,600
Who would suspect a cop?
We have to warn Lana.

435
00:34:23,774 --> 00:34:27,767
If one is the kidnapper, he knows Lana's
seeing through his eyes.

436
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:32,712
-Great, I'll drive.
-That's okay. We'll take my car.

437
00:34:44,962 --> 00:34:46,793
Miss Lang.

438
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:52,960
I know it's late, but I just wanted to
ask you a few more questions.

439
00:34:53,604 --> 00:34:55,799
Surprised you found the time.

440
00:34:55,973 --> 00:34:58,100
I know I deserve that.

441
00:34:59,343 --> 00:35:01,675
Do you want a cup of coffee?

442
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:03,746
Sure.

443
00:35:03,914 --> 00:35:05,472
Okay.

444
00:35:35,012 --> 00:35:38,448
-Where is Lana?
-I don't know, she was here.

445
00:35:38,615 --> 00:35:40,742
The guy must have grabbed her.

446
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:42,316
I'm gonna check the back.

447
00:35:42,486 --> 00:35:44,886
-Deputy, where's your partner tonight?
-Gary?

448
00:35:45,055 --> 00:35:48,149
He's working a second job at the carnival.
He's a security guard.

449
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:50,225
You saw stuffed animals and train tracks.

450
00:35:50,394 --> 00:35:53,591
The carnival's closed this time of year.
It's perfect to hide someone.

451
00:36:06,076 --> 00:36:07,634
Hello?

452
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:12,615
Hello?

453
00:36:15,285 --> 00:36:16,547
Help!

454
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,246
Somebody please help me!

455
00:36:21,692 --> 00:36:23,626
No one can hear you.

456
00:36:25,062 --> 00:36:28,498
-How did you see through my eyes?
-I don't know.

457
00:36:39,142 --> 00:36:40,575
Deputy Watts.

458
00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:42,941
Why are you doing this?

459
00:36:43,113 --> 00:36:49,518
I never wanted to hurt Chloe. I didn't even
want money. I wanted to rescue her.

460
00:36:49,686 --> 00:36:52,587
You kidnapped Chloe so you could
take credit for finding her?

461
00:36:52,756 --> 00:36:54,018
I could have been good!

462
00:36:54,491 --> 00:36:57,517
The best cop this town's ever seen!

463
00:36:57,694 --> 00:37:01,528
This case would've made my career!

464
00:37:08,805 --> 00:37:12,366
But it doesn't matter now.
I can still be the hero.

465
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:14,840
What are you going to do?

466
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,373
Solve your murder.

467
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:23,985
No, please, please don't do this.

468
00:37:41,738 --> 00:37:43,000
Lana.

469
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:18,637
-Lana, you all right?
-Clark, it's Watts, Deputy Watts.

470
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:21,039
Okay, stay here.

471
00:38:32,122 --> 00:38:34,488
It's over, Watts.

472
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,722
What the hell are you?

473
00:39:02,085 --> 00:39:03,347
Lana!

474
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,147
Gary, drop the gun!

475
00:39:44,094 --> 00:39:46,358
Your mom told me you'd be out here.

476
00:39:49,165 --> 00:39:51,429
I haven't seen that smile in a week.
What's up?

477
00:39:51,601 --> 00:39:52,966
Well, I've got good news.

478
00:39:53,136 --> 00:39:55,604
<i>The Daily Planet called,
and I got an internship.</i>

479
00:39:55,772 --> 00:39:57,501
-That's great!
-Yeah!

480
00:39:57,674 --> 00:39:59,733
-You didn't even interview.
-I know. Well...

481
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:04,074
<i>...they read my article in the Ledger on the
cop, and I guess my work spoke for itself.</i>

482
00:40:04,681 --> 00:40:07,445
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

483
00:40:07,617 --> 00:40:09,881
So I guess you'll spend the summer
in Metropolis.

484
00:40:10,053 --> 00:40:11,452
Yeah.

485
00:40:13,123 --> 00:40:15,114
-Will you come visit me?
-Yeah, of course!

486
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:19,023
I would never pass up an opportunity
to see you in your natural habitat.

487
00:40:24,668 --> 00:40:29,503
Well, I just wanted you to be the first
to know, so I'll see you. Bye.

488
00:40:30,774 --> 00:40:32,264
Chloe.

489
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:38,104
I was-- Do you have plans
for the spring formal?

490
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:44,119
Not at the moment.

491
00:40:45,455 --> 00:40:47,753
I was hoping....

492
00:40:49,259 --> 00:40:51,284
I was hoping you'd go with me.

493
00:40:52,862 --> 00:40:54,830
As my date.

494
00:41:01,705 --> 00:41:03,036
I would love to, Clark.

495
00:41:07,377 --> 00:41:09,811
Now I'm gonna go before my
good karma runs out.

496
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:13,778
Chloe...

497
00:41:14,651 --> 00:41:16,619
...l'm sorry I didn't ask you sooner.

498
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,955
It's okay. It was worth the wait.

499
00:41:36,673 --> 00:41:41,007
Lex, where's that crop-duster of yours?
I wanted to talk to him.

500
00:41:41,177 --> 00:41:44,146
-He seems to have disappeared.
-Maybe your visit scared him.

501
00:41:44,314 --> 00:41:45,576
Something or someone did.

502
00:41:45,749 --> 00:41:47,979
-What do you have for me?
-Preliminary results...

503
00:41:48,151 --> 00:41:49,550
...of the fragment we recovered.

504
00:41:50,186 --> 00:41:52,279
So, what is it?

505
00:41:52,455 --> 00:41:55,618
