1
00:00:00,927 --> 00:00:05,659
Ready! Down! Set!
Blue-47! Blue-47! Hut!

2
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:15,534
Nice one, cormier!Way to find your man!

3
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:18,869
All right, dan!Looking good, baby!

4
00:00:21,976 --> 00:00:24,148
Hey, clark,how are you holding up?

5
00:00:24,594 --> 00:00:27,213
Just enjoying the view.
From the bench.

6
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:31,233
Right, listen, I talked to coach quigley about you.
But you know him. He's old school.

7
00:00:31,257 --> 00:00:35,554
He already feels like he's gota squad for the season.
But just, uh, hang in there for me, all right?

8
00:00:37,644 --> 00:00:39,828
Go on in, guys. Grab a drink.

9
00:00:39,864 --> 00:00:41,390
Nice catch, buddy!

10
00:00:41,422 --> 00:00:44,032
It's all about you and me this year, bro!

11
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:46,934
All right, cut it out,mandy. Just cut it out.

12
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:48,695
Sorry.

13
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:51,008
So, what are wedoing saturday night?

14
00:00:51,032 --> 00:00:54,402
Uh, "we" aren't doing anything.
I'm hanging out with nate and the boys.

15
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:57,283
Didn't I mention that to you before?

16
00:00:58,249 --> 00:01:00,950
It's okay.
I just want to make you happy,

17
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:03,251
All right.
I got you a drink.

18
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:25,618
You know what?

19
00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:28,706
Screw the guys.

20
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,899
I wanna hang out with you on saturday night.

21
00:01:34,932 --> 00:01:37,375
Well, why wait till Saturday when we can go shopping now?

22
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:39,216
Whatever you want, baby.

23
00:01:39,263 --> 00:01:40,801
I'm gonna go hit the showers.

24
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,376
- Where are you going, bud?The field's this way.
- I'm going shopping with mandy.

25
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:49,515
You what?

26
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:52,415
- I'll be in the car, baby.
- See ya.

27
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:57,920
- You checking out my girlfriend, buddy?
- What are you talking about?

28
00:02:02,974 --> 00:02:05,898
Danny, you walk off this field,you're on the bench friday!

29
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:07,001
Eat me, dude!

30
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:10,230
Clark, looks like a spot just opened up.
Why don't you hop in there?

31
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:13,538
Go get 'em.

32
00:02:14,254 --> 00:02:15,217
Clark.

33
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:16,931
You're gonna need one of these.

34
00:02:20,254 --> 00:02:22,600
Don't get too comfortable out there, clark.

35
00:02:22,717 --> 00:02:25,230
Danny's this team'squarterback.

36
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:29,983
Let's get 'em, boys.

37
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:30,758
Yeah.

38
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:33,929
Blue-19!
I'm not the center, jerk.

39
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:39,938
Blue-19!
Hike!

40
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:52,091
Nice throw, kent!Keep it up!

41
00:02:53,194 --> 00:02:54,380
All right!

42
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:56,481
Boy's locker room.

43
00:03:27,432 --> 00:03:31,090
- put the gun down, man. Let's talk about this.
- It's too late, coach.

44
00:03:31,138 --> 00:03:34,598
You shouldn't have hit on my girl.

45
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:12,576

www. forom. com

49
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,784
- ow, ow, ow.
- I haven't even touched it yet.

50
00:05:09,114 --> 00:05:13,176
- I'm just practicing.
- Good, because it's really deep.

51
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:22,309
Well, I guess it could've been a lot worse...
if clark hadn't tackled me out of the way.

52
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,544
I've never seen anybody move that
fast. I gotta get him off the bench.

53
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:30,158
Of course, that shouldn't be hard now. Do they
still expel students for taking potshots at coaches?

54
00:05:30,231 --> 00:05:32,658
- This isn't funny, jason.
- Right.

55
00:05:32,768 --> 00:05:36,533
Imagine being your girlfriend and
finding out about this from chloe.

56
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:42,930
I felt faint and I wanted to scream, but I couldn't because
why would lana be freaking outover the new assistant coach?

57
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:51,916
You know, this is usually the part where I would buy you a massive
bouquet of flowers and take you out to a really nice dinner, but

58
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:56,016
I can't, because my dad just cut me off.

59
00:05:56,144 --> 00:06:00,538
Because I decided to follow my heart
instead of the big bucks at business school.

60
00:06:02,486 --> 00:06:04,839
Hey.
I need this job,

61
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:09,145
okay? I mean, it's something I love, you know,
and it works well with my college schedule.

62
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:11,406
It allows me
to be close to you.

63
00:06:11,461 --> 00:06:14,861
I know the only downside is that we
have to fly under the radar, but...

64
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,920
I'm sorry for that.

65
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:31,570
It's just
I've never been happier.

66
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:36,953
And to not be able
to share that is frustrating.

67
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:40,593
Well, you know you can always
take your frustration out on me.

68
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,281
Well, can you please tell the dean
there's been an egregious error?

69
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:57,428
I belong at metropolis university,
not walking the halls of podunk high.

70
00:06:57,648 --> 00:07:01,958
Well, yes, I'm sure that we could work this all
out if you could just get him to call me back.

71
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:02,840
Thank you.

72
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:04,123
You know,

73
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:09,040
if you spent as much time studying as you did trying
to leave, you'd be in college already.

74
00:07:09,205 --> 00:07:12,510
And where'd you get that pearl of wisdom
- the farmer's almanac?

75
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:15,464
So, what do you think?

76
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:17,875
They're not really
your colors.

77
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:20,758
They're
the school's colors.

78
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,649
I'm glad you made the team,
clark, but why be a conformist?

79
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:30,143
At least with the whole farm boy plaid thing -
as lame as it is -it completely belongs to you.

80
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,912
In the future, let's restrict our conversations
to "hello" and "goodbye. "

81
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:38,132
And those thighs?
1, 2, 3...

82
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:39,648
- No!
- No!

83
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,427
Yeah, so the party'sgonna be way kick.

84
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:55,689
Where are we -
some kind of freakish feminist parallel universe?

85
00:07:57,822 --> 00:08:00,595
Hey, chloe, have you seen the way these football players
are acting?

86
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:04,183
Yeah, and I noticed one of them unloaded a shotgun
in the boys' locker room.

87
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:08,845
I was thinking about maybe doing an article on it,
but the only two reporters I have are late again.

88
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:11,652
Oh, hi. It's you.

89
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:15,784
Sorry. I was storming the gates of metropolis U.,
Trying to get them to change their admissions policy.

90
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,872
And I had to pick up my new jacket.
What do you think?

91
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,958
It's not exactly your colors.

92
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:23,296
It's the school colors.

93
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:26,561
Whatever. Anyway, lois,
I need you to go to the smallville medical center.

94
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:29,662
Apparently, our gun-totingex-quarterback
woke up this morning

95
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:33,456
and he's feeling the sting of second-degree burns.
He's been apologizing nonstop, so...

96
00:08:33,485 --> 00:08:38,220
I'm sure he doesn't love the prospect of playing
tight end for the Kansas state boys' home.

97
00:08:40,392 --> 00:08:41,421
Hello?

98
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,068
Yes, I will hold for the dean.

99
00:08:44,112 --> 00:08:45,715
I've gotta go

100
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:49,730
All right, I guess I'll goto smallville medical center.
Clark, I need you to talk to coach teague.

101
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:53,421
After all, you were there. Nice save, by the way.

102
00:08:54,956 --> 00:08:56,574
Actually, chloe,

103
00:08:56,632 --> 00:08:58,662
with this whole football thing,

104
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:01,529
I'm gonna have to dial back my time at the "torch. "

105
00:09:06,294 --> 00:09:07,098
Oh.

106
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:11,465
I guess I've got my work cut out for me.

107
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,304
I'm sorry.

108
00:09:14,774 --> 00:09:15,877
You know,

109
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:18,272
- my priorities
- you know what?

110
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:19,728
Don't worry about it.

111
00:09:19,757 --> 00:09:23,507
This has gotta bea pretty big deal for you.
I mean, you're the new starting quarterback, right?

112
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:25,125
It's gotta be pretty exciting.

113
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:26,742
It is, but...

114
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:30,049
I'm just not sure the other guys want me around.

115
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:32,269
They've been playing together for three years.

116
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:34,767
You're on the team for two weeks,
and all of a sudden,you're starting?

117
00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:37,223
What'd you expect -hugs and kisses?

118
00:09:41,356 --> 00:09:42,370
Nice.

119
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,474
What's going on?

120
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:56,224
You owe me one, clark.
I saved it from the toilet.

121
00:09:56,338 --> 00:09:57,676
Thanks.

122
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:02,426
All right, ladies,listen up.

123
00:10:02,676 --> 00:10:05,117
You've obviously found the new jerseys.

124
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,085
I want to introduce you to the man
responsible for 'em -lex luthor!

125
00:10:15,953 --> 00:10:19,336
The coaches tell me this is going to be a rebuilding season,

126
00:10:20,483 --> 00:10:22,616
and I want to encourage you to keep at it.

127
00:10:23,454 --> 00:10:25,542
In my life,I've learned that

128
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,172
you can never give upon something
that means a lot to you,

129
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:32,804
even when you're coming off a losing season.

130
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:35,010
You keep trying.

131
00:10:36,642 --> 00:10:39,098
Because sometimes you just need a fresh start.

132
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:46,010
So, please,

133
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:47,613
enjoy the new uniforms.

134
00:10:47,657 --> 00:10:48,848
All right, all right!

135
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:57,714
I know what you're doing.

136
00:10:59,903 --> 00:11:01,815
But you can't buy back my friendship.

137
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:11,935
Coach teague,

138
00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:12,626
- Hey.
- Hey.

139
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:17,008
I'm doing a story on the "torch" on dan cormier and I was
just wondering if I could talk to you for a little bit.

140
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:18,699
Can it wait? I'm in the middle of a practice.

141
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:20,611
It's only gonna take,like, two seconds, I promise.

142
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,123
- I'll do it later.
- Okay.

143
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:23,741
- I will.
- Okay.

144
00:11:31,505 --> 00:11:32,917
Hi, ladies.

145
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,803
Gee, coach, I sure hope you have someone special
in your life.

146
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:42,185
Well, mandy, I don't think thats any of your business.

147
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,129
But, yeah,I do have somebody.

148
00:11:55,945 --> 00:11:58,847
guys,
you gotta give your quarterback some protection.

149
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:02,185
You gotta hold the pocket.
Come on, carlsen,you gotta move around!

150
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:03,876
Hey, clark, hi.

151
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:06,510
I know youre not exactly
journalistically inclined right now, but...

152
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,474
this isn't a good time, chloe.

153
00:12:08,523 --> 00:12:09,618
Right.

154
00:12:10,132 --> 00:12:11,456
Priorities.

155
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:30,403
Blue-23!
Blue-23!

156
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:31,623
- Clark...
- Hut!

157
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:35,476
Hello...

158
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:39,715
uh, look, I'm gonna need you
to run with that psycho quarterback story.

159
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,935
You might want to interview his girlfriend mandy.
She's a cheerleader.

160
00:12:43,112 --> 00:12:46,318
Hi, I'm busy trying to get out of mayberry.

161
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:49,125
That's fine. Do whatever you want.
You're in charge now.

162
00:12:49,345 --> 00:12:51,228
I'm quitting the "torch. "

163
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:52,360
Whoa,

164
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:53,551
wait.

165
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:54,786
Quitting?

166
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,255
Why?

167
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:59,725
I finally understand why it never worked with clark.

168
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,887
Okay, I'll bite.

169
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:04,461
Because I was never there for him.

170
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:08,505
I was always here,
buried in this stupid school newspaper.

171
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,375
I wasn't devoted to him,

172
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:13,669
but that's all gonna change now.

173
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:19,169
Please stop with your crazy talk.
You can't quit because,

174
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:22,240
seriously,
I need the credits,and...

175
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:25,475
how many anvils are you gonna let this guy drop on you?

176
00:13:27,358 --> 00:13:29,020
You know what's crazy?

177
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:32,540
I actually thought youd be happy for me.

178
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:36,510
Now that lana and clark are finally a thing of the past,
I may actually have a shot at this.

179
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,554
Why are you getting in my way?

180
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:39,951
Fine.

181
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,642
Looks like I'm gonna be covering the pom-pom beat.

182
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:45,993
Thank you.

183
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:58,550
Seriously, mandy, the 24-hourmourning period's over.
You need a new boyfriend to take to our pool party.

184
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,756
Okay, I'm not taking a step down from dan
and dating some wide receiver, rhonda.

185
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:05,035
Well, clark kent's the new quarterback.

186
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:06,665
And he's hot.

187
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:08,444
No decisions.

188
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:09,812
I'll scope him out.

189
00:14:11,797 --> 00:14:13,120
Mandy, right?

190
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:17,076
I'm lois lane. I'm doing an article for the
"torch" about what happened to your boyfriend.

191
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:18,889
She doesn't want to talk about it.

192
00:14:18,913 --> 00:14:20,979
I don't want to write the article, either,
but

193
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:23,450
my cousin dumped it on me and I need the credits,
so let's...

194
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:25,564
I wouldn't give that geek rag a quote

195
00:14:25,587 --> 00:14:28,417
if it were the last paper on earth.
Darn,

196
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:31,280
and I thought it was gonna be so insightful.

197
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:34,356
Oh, look,

198
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:36,455
your valets are here...

199
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:40,459
except you don't have one anymore, do you?

200
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:43,768
I could have another boyfriend... like that.

201
00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:47,431
It's amazing what a short skirt and the ability to run
will get ya.

202
00:14:53,132 --> 00:14:54,732
The love molecule.

203
00:14:54,785 --> 00:14:56,158
Oh, advanced chem.

204
00:14:56,193 --> 00:14:59,458
How many cheerleaders does it take
to draw a double helix?

205
00:15:00,477 --> 00:15:02,297
- You want a quote?
- Yeah.

206
00:15:02,332 --> 00:15:04,657
Back off... bitch.

207
00:15:11,974 --> 00:15:13,782
Just got my headline.

208
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,738
Chloe...

209
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:30,059
what's going on?

210
00:15:40,584 --> 00:15:41,499
So...

211
00:15:41,878 --> 00:15:46,056
remember that conversation we had this morning
about your priorities?

212
00:15:46,081 --> 00:15:51,292
Well, I've been thinking about my priorities,
and I think they're all screwed up.

213
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,578
Who needs the "torch"?
Especially if you're not going to be there.

214
00:15:57,651 --> 00:15:58,884
Right.

215
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:05,241
But that still doesn't answer
why you're only wearing...

216
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:06,956
my football jersey.

217
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:10,138
I wanna make you my number-one priority.

218
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:13,249
I would do anything for you.

219
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:16,478
Things that lana would never do.

220
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,249
Things to help relieve your stress.

221
00:16:20,623 --> 00:16:22,018
Like what?

222
00:16:25,564 --> 00:16:26,820
Chloe...

223
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,850
chloe! Hey, chloe.
Are...

224
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:33,757
- Are you feeling okay?
- I've never felt happier.

225
00:16:33,898 --> 00:16:35,189
Clark.

226
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:38,031
- Uh...
- Can't you see?

227
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:40,649
I'm devoted to you.

228
00:16:40,682 --> 00:16:42,784
I love you, clark.

229
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:54,116
clark,

230
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:58,002
I got all your football gear together,
but I can't find your jersey.

231
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,844
Its, uh, in the barn.

232
00:17:01,073 --> 00:17:02,922
I forgot it up there.
I'll, uh...

233
00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:04,507
I'll get it later.

234
00:17:06,606 --> 00:17:08,558
Hey, mom, can I talk to you for a second?

235
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:10,716
Of course, honey. What's up?

236
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:12,873
It's about chloe.

237
00:17:15,264 --> 00:17:17,744
Um, she came onto me last night.
Pretty strong.

238
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,212
I'm worried about her.

239
00:17:19,447 --> 00:17:21,149
Don't worry,nothing happened.

240
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,204
I thought you two agreed to be friends.

241
00:17:23,248 --> 00:17:24,246
We did...

242
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:26,386
and then pulled a 180° on me.

243
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:31,450
Maybe chloe's decided lifes too short
to bury her feelings anymore.

244
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:33,167
How do you feel about her?

245
00:17:33,196 --> 00:17:35,603
The problem is,I'm not over lana yet.

246
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:38,781
Sometimes, I think I never will be.

247
00:17:40,395 --> 00:17:42,054
Oh, sweetheart,

248
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,620
there's somebody out there for you.
I know it.

249
00:17:46,428 --> 00:17:48,277
So, what do I do about chloe?

250
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,342
If you don't feel the same way,

251
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:54,160
just be honest.

252
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:58,387
- Hello.
- Hi.

253
00:17:58,622 --> 00:18:01,452
Oh, I gotta get to the talon.
Okay,

254
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,903
um,I'll see you two later.

255
00:18:04,372 --> 00:18:05,268
Bye.

256
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,633
Bye.

257
00:18:08,027 --> 00:18:09,275
So, clark,

258
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,469
tell me,

259
00:18:11,528 --> 00:18:13,500
how's football practice going?

260
00:18:15,357 --> 00:18:17,470
It's actually not going so good.

261
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:21,568
Some of the guys have been giving me a hard time
since they found out I was starting.

262
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,664
- Missing my passes...
- nobody said it was gonna be easy.

263
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:29,515
The frustrating part is,I could score every time.

264
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:30,699
Clark,

265
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:33,006
we talked about that whole thing, remember?

266
00:18:33,358 --> 00:18:37,249
The football field is not a place
for you to be using your powers to save the day.

267
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:39,316
I just said it was frustrating.

268
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,014
Look, son, if you're gonna be the quarterback,
then you have to be the leader.

269
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:47,875
Of course,a bunch of the guys are gonna want to challenge
that, especially if they don't think you deserve it.

270
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:49,572
Same thing happened to me.

271
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:53,482
I thought your team worshipped
the groundyou walked on.

272
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:56,840
Well, not when I was a sophomore, they didn'T.

273
00:18:57,263 --> 00:18:59,856
See, the coach made me starting quarterback.

274
00:18:59,914 --> 00:19:02,310
A bunch of the seniors didnt like that very much.

275
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,550
What did you do?

276
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:07,698
I earned their respect.

277
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:21,900
- Hey, is everything okay?
- Hey.

278
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:24,683
Yeah. It is now.

279
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:27,604
- Hey, what are you doing?
- It's called kissing my girlfriend.

280
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:30,305
You know, I was talking more in the "big picture" sense.

281
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:35,844
The ladyfrom the attendance office
announced to my entire

282
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:39,296
advanced lit class
that coach Teague needed to see me.

283
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,917
Okay.

284
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,494
I don't want you to take this the wrong way,

285
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:47,899
but this sudden,spontaneous outburst...

286
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:50,409
it's a little strange,even for you.

287
00:19:50,494 --> 00:19:54,343
You have sacrificed an incredible amount
to be with me.

288
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:56,503
I will not cost you your job.

289
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:59,448
My job doesn't matter, okay?You do.
I wanna make you happy.

290
00:19:59,472 --> 00:20:00,411
I know,

291
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,102
and I love that.

292
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:06,561
I just think that we should discuss this later.

293
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:08,651
Okay, but will you promise me something?

294
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:10,178
Depends...

295
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:11,810
come by practice after school.

296
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,511
Just stand on the sideline for, like, 10 minutes,
but I just

297
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:15,951
wanna see you.

298
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:22,808
All right, guys, let's graba drink before scrimmage.

299
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,263
Lana?

300
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:35,623
What are you doing here?

301
00:20:36,126 --> 00:20:40,693
I-I heard that clark kent was our new starting quarterback.
I had to see it for myself.

302
00:20:40,752 --> 00:20:41,785
Really.

303
00:20:42,313 --> 00:20:44,286
You came out hereto watch me practice?

304
00:20:45,636 --> 00:20:46,831
That means a lot.

305
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:54,710
Hey, kent! You wanna join us or what?

306
00:20:55,945 --> 00:20:56,907
I better go.

307
00:20:56,934 --> 00:20:59,752
Seems like our new assistant coach
is working you pretty hard.

308
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:02,722
No, uh, he's actually pretty cool.

309
00:21:06,657 --> 00:21:07,585
I'll see you.

310
00:21:07,632 --> 00:21:08,853
See ya.

311
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,450
Hey,

312
00:21:10,814 --> 00:21:13,467
what did you do to my cousin?
She's freaking me out.

313
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,345
Nothing. She's hitting on me.

314
00:21:15,381 --> 00:21:18,398
Well, obviously, you sent some kind of signal
that you were interested.

315
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:21,463
Look, lois, I gota big game coming up,
and I'm trying to make a good impression here, all right?

316
00:21:21,486 --> 00:21:23,245
So could we talk about this later?

317
00:21:23,268 --> 00:21:24,313
Hey,

318
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,593
Hey, clark!

319
00:21:25,628 --> 00:21:27,155
- Hi!
- Oh, my god.

320
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,292
Hi, clark! Hi!Ha ha!

321
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:30,959
Ta-da!

322
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:32,155
Hi!

323
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:35,537
Chloe, what's up with the cheerleader outfit?

324
00:21:35,572 --> 00:21:37,744
I found it in the storage locker.

325
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:40,386
I thought, you know,what better way
to support my...

326
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:43,921
new favorite starting quarterback
than to joint he cheerleading squad?

327
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:45,972
We can be together all the time.

328
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:47,144
Yeah...

329
00:21:52,298 --> 00:21:53,707
what is she doing here?

330
00:21:55,387 --> 00:21:57,481
Hey, kent!Sometime today.

331
00:21:57,886 --> 00:21:58,731
Okay.

332
00:21:58,755 --> 00:21:59,694
Good luck!

333
00:21:59,788 --> 00:22:00,668
Bye.

334
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:03,721
Oh, my god, she's taken the fast train to step ford.

335
00:22:03,745 --> 00:22:05,259
I need you to keep her away from me.

336
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,541
With what -a tranquilizer gun?

337
00:22:07,564 --> 00:22:10,934
There's obviously something wrong.
I just need some time to figure it out, okay?

338
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,529
Okay.

339
00:22:26,468 --> 00:22:28,440
Kent, what's wrong with you?

340
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:31,620
Coach, I'm not feeling very good.

341
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,416
I think I better leave.

342
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:35,858
You're gonna walk away because you don't feel well.

343
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:38,028
You know, maybe I was wrong about you, kent.

344
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:39,801
Coach, I...

345
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,781
you know, your team's waiting for you out there.
Are you a leader or not?

346
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:54,252
Tell the rest of the guys
they got a green light on kent.

347
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:56,551
I've been too easy on him.

348
00:23:08,398 --> 00:23:10,500
It's okay, clark, it's okay!Just shake it off!

349
00:23:10,535 --> 00:23:12,320
How's it taste?

350
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,336
Best on the team -clark kent!
Come on, gimme a "k"

351
00:23:19,371 --> 00:23:21,802
- Gimme an "e"! Gimme an "n"!
- Blue-37! Hike!

352
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:23,411
Gimme a "t"!

353
00:23:25,063 --> 00:23:25,944
Oh!

354
00:23:26,144 --> 00:23:29,149
Keep going, baby!Taking one for the team!

355
00:23:30,652 --> 00:23:32,058
Need a hand?

356
00:23:32,082 --> 00:23:35,181
You're the number one quaterback! Yeah!

357
00:23:37,401 --> 00:23:40,322
Blue-17! Hut!

358
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:42,859
Oh! Oh!

359
00:23:42,882 --> 00:23:45,688
It's okay!It's okay! It's okay!It's just a bruise!

360
00:23:46,316 --> 00:23:48,321
Attaboy, kent.

361
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,574
Attaboy, kent.

362
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:55,660
You can do it!You can do it!

363
00:23:55,704 --> 00:23:59,434
Defense! Go, defense!Yeah, defense!
All right! Whoo! Yeah!

364
00:24:00,037 --> 00:24:01,810
Go, clark!

365
00:24:14,215 --> 00:24:15,446
Chloe,

366
00:24:15,504 --> 00:24:18,146
if that's you, I'm not feeling very well right now.

367
00:24:20,612 --> 00:24:22,033
Hey, coach teague.

368
00:24:22,056 --> 00:24:23,289
Clark, we need to talk.

369
00:24:23,312 --> 00:24:26,492
Look, I know this is gonna sound weird,
but I think there's something in that drink cooler.

370
00:24:26,527 --> 00:24:28,382
Yeah, you should've stayed away from my girlfriend.

371
00:24:28,406 --> 00:24:29,897
What are you talking about?

372
00:25:18,795 --> 00:25:19,899
Clark...

373
00:25:20,991 --> 00:25:21,989
Lex.

374
00:25:22,012 --> 00:25:23,151
Are you okay?

375
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:24,724
Who was that?

376
00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:35,064
Are you sure you dont want to call the police?

377
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:38,537
It's not like either of us got a good look at him, anyway.

378
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:01,621
That's odd.

379
00:26:01,668 --> 00:26:02,455
What?

380
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:05,261
I could've sworn there was a cut above your eye.

381
00:26:05,918 --> 00:26:07,125
Actually,

382
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,603
I'm feeling a lot better all of a sudden.

383
00:26:09,638 --> 00:26:12,526
Yeah, well, I still think you should have a doctor
take a look at you.

384
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:14,311
I'm just lucky you were here.

385
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:18,552
Why are you here?

386
00:26:18,622 --> 00:26:20,583
I wanted to give you something.

387
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:27,229
It's every file I ever had on you.

388
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:29,542
How do I know you don't have a copy?

389
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,395
You don'T.

390
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:33,945
But it's the truth.

391
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:36,305
Lex, if this friendship was so important,

392
00:26:37,315 --> 00:26:39,483
why'd you lie to me for so long?

393
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,878
I don't know, clark.

394
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:47,315
There's a darkness in me that I can't always control.

395
00:26:48,395 --> 00:26:50,912
I'm starting to think thats my curse...

396
00:26:51,065 --> 00:26:53,894
why every relationship I have ends badly.

397
00:26:55,362 --> 00:26:58,448
- We all have a dark side, lex.
- Yeah.

398
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:02,780
But I can feel mine creeping over the corners.

399
00:27:04,366 --> 00:27:07,052
Your friendship helps keep it at bay.

400
00:27:07,757 --> 00:27:10,962
It reminds me that there are truly good people in the world.

401
00:27:12,101 --> 00:27:14,623
I'm not one to give up on that.

402
00:27:19,989 --> 00:27:21,407
Good night, clark.

403
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,384
I'm looking for coach teague. He just attacked me in my loft.

404
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,591
After that performance on the field today,

405
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,051
I'm not surprised.

406
00:27:38,463 --> 00:27:39,703
I'm kidding.

407
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:44,550
Look, the cheerleaders are spiking the water cooler at
practice. That's why Chloe and the players are acting so weird.

408
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,295
Nice work, smallville.

409
00:27:46,353 --> 00:27:48,018
You want to know what they're using?

410
00:27:49,054 --> 00:27:52,230
You actually did some investigative reporting?

411
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:55,321
My cousin goes martha Stewart without the jail time?
Yeah.

412
00:27:55,357 --> 00:27:58,067
Suddenly, the power of the press interests me.

413
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,544
Look what I found.

414
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,278
Mandy and rhonda did a science fair project together.

415
00:28:04,795 --> 00:28:05,862
So?

416
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,774
So that'sour smoking gun.

417
00:28:08,797 --> 00:28:13,177
According to the chemistry teacher,
they researched a hormone called phenylithamine.

418
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:15,417
Phenylithamine.

419
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,065
- "The love molecule. "
- Exactly.

420
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:22,294
- So it's a love potion?
- Yeah, but it didn't work.

421
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:24,408
Until they added the meteor rock.

422
00:28:24,617 --> 00:28:25,403
Whatever.

423
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:27,165
We have to find a way to reverse the effect.

424
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:30,605
Well, it must wear off at some point.
Otherwise, they wouldn't keep juicing the football players.

425
00:28:30,628 --> 00:28:34,538
We don't have enough time. What if another player
goes into a jealous rage and hurts someone?

426
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:37,031
Wait a minute.

427
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,532
You drank some of it, too.

428
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:41,187
I saw you.

429
00:28:42,984 --> 00:28:45,083
How come you're not going all love slave?

430
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,209
I don't know.

431
00:28:47,864 --> 00:28:48,928
What's your point?

432
00:28:48,976 --> 00:28:51,739
That science report sin mandy's faux prada bag.

433
00:28:51,774 --> 00:28:54,298
Presumably it can tell us how to reverse this, right?

434
00:28:54,322 --> 00:28:57,469
And presumably, youre infected.

435
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,124
The cheerleaders are having a pool party tonight.

436
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,566
How do you lookin a swimsuit, clark?

437
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:42,303
Okay, clark,

438
00:29:42,338 --> 00:29:44,675
prada bag, folder.
Showtime.

439
00:29:44,698 --> 00:29:46,295
Lois, I don't think...

440
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:47,540
Lois

441
00:29:55,314 --> 00:29:56,571
Hi, mandy.

442
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,074
Hey, clark.

443
00:29:58,684 --> 00:30:00,316
Welcome to the party.

444
00:30:10,144 --> 00:30:11,962
I'm devoted to you.

445
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:17,621
Yeah, I can work with this.

446
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:23,284
Lois.

447
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,924
Oh, you're so strong.

448
00:30:47,321 --> 00:30:49,270
Y-you're so beautiful.

449
00:30:49,998 --> 00:30:50,985
So...

450
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:01,979
So...

451
00:31:02,105 --> 00:31:03,514
tell me,

452
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:05,264
since you like me so much,

453
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:07,166
what are you gonna do for me?

454
00:31:07,471 --> 00:31:08,868
I'll buy you dinner.

455
00:31:13,253 --> 00:31:14,192
I'll cook

456
00:31:14,216 --> 00:31:17,738
- I'll cook you dinner.
- Oh, that is so hot!

457
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:29,866
You seem distracted.

458
00:31:29,913 --> 00:31:32,672
- Um, I'm just nervous.
- Why?

459
00:31:33,415 --> 00:31:34,519
I've, um,

460
00:31:34,566 --> 00:31:37,525
never done
what I think were about to do before.

461
00:32:00,472 --> 00:32:01,705
What?

462
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,891
Oh!

463
00:32:02,912 --> 00:32:04,814
- Ooh!
- Oh! Ooh!

464
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:37,372
Gross

465
00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:40,284
All right...

466
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,335
- Chloe,what the hell?
- I know what you're up to!

467
00:32:48,358 --> 00:32:50,707
I went through this with lana,
and I'm not gonna go through it with you!

468
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:53,548
Steal clark!

469
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,201
Are you getting bored?

470
00:32:55,236 --> 00:32:56,857
- No.
- Good.

471
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,346
Because I'm just getting started.

472
00:33:04,453 --> 00:33:06,132
Chloe, this is stupid!

473
00:33:06,848 --> 00:33:08,609
I don't want to hurt you!

474
00:33:10,147 --> 00:33:12,120
Too late. You already did.

475
00:33:16,446 --> 00:33:18,325
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

476
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,192
- Are you okay, chloe?
- Yeah.

477
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,648
What happened?

478
00:33:21,671 --> 00:33:23,209
Whats going on?

479
00:33:32,084 --> 00:33:32,953
So...

480
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:35,721
- how far do you want to go here?
- Um...

481
00:33:36,508 --> 00:33:38,786
right about there would be great, thanks.

482
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,660
- Chloe, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

483
00:33:48,683 --> 00:33:51,220
- I can't believe you,clark.
- Oh, please,

484
00:33:51,255 --> 00:33:55,126
do you know how pathetic it is that you had to
resort to chemicals to control your boyfriend?

485
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:57,145
I'm sick of being a distant second to a football.

486
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:59,670
So you created a bunch of psycho nut jobs.

487
00:33:59,987 --> 00:34:01,079
No offense.

488
00:34:01,384 --> 00:34:02,394
None taken.

489
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,965
What took you so long?

490
00:34:05,004 --> 00:34:08,620
Oh, she was attacked by a, uh, crazy plumber.

491
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:10,581
Yeah.

492
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:13,526
Did you find the cure?

493
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:16,344
Yeah, we worked out our own little experiment.

494
00:34:17,894 --> 00:34:21,909
I accidentally burned her on the furnace in the boiler room,
and she snapped out of it.

495
00:34:22,383 --> 00:34:24,837
Just like dan snapped out of it when the gun heated up.

496
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,304
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

497
00:34:26,927 --> 00:34:28,958
- So it's the heat.
- Yeah.

498
00:34:29,897 --> 00:34:31,257
Uh, you guys, whe...

499
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:32,560
where's mandy?

500
00:34:34,298 --> 00:34:37,139
- Oh, nice, clark.
- You know, you only have one thing to do.

501
00:34:37,163 --> 00:34:38,642
Me? You're closer to the door.

502
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:42,526
- Okay, so it's automatically my fault?
- Uh, guys, guys, guys.

503
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:45,567
Oh, hey, we were just talking about you.

504
00:34:45,602 --> 00:34:48,385
Yeah? Well, now you're gonna wish you never crossed me.

505
00:34:48,403 --> 00:34:50,047
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

506
00:34:50,082 --> 00:34:51,667
Cheer us to death?

507
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:55,997
Oh, great, here comes the love squad.

508
00:35:08,922 --> 00:35:10,376
Let's get outta here.

509
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,585
Come on, lois.

510
00:35:11,632 --> 00:35:13,311
Bring it on, hotshot.

511
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:17,738
lois,what are you doing?

512
00:35:17,761 --> 00:35:20,541
Hey, clark, you got any explosions up your sleeve?

513
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:22,749
You're gonna pay, bitch!

514
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:37,214
Okay, what the hell was that?

515
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,511
I guess the pipe must've broken or something.

516
00:35:42,062 --> 00:35:43,401
Pretty lucky, huh?

517
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:48,875
Yeah. You better hope for that kind of luck tomorrow
on the field.

518
00:35:58,376 --> 00:36:01,805
When they told me Clark kent was downstairs,
I couldn't believe it.

519
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,490
I wanted you to see for yourself
that the investigation is over.

520
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,358
What's that?

521
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,767
The Porsche you pulled me out of the day we met.

522
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,564
Why is it still here?

523
00:36:23,145 --> 00:36:25,376
To remind me of what I almost lost.

524
00:36:27,295 --> 00:36:28,869
It's over, Clark.

525
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,628
It really is.

526
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:36,804
Look, I'm willing to give this friendship another shot
if you are.

527
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:48,019
In the spirit of friendship,
I was wondering if you could help me with a problem.

528
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,651
Absolutely.

529
00:36:50,032 --> 00:36:50,983
What is it?

530
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,169
Well, it's a who.

531
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:55,988
Lois lane.

532
00:37:00,373 --> 00:37:01,257
Clark,

533
00:37:01,798 --> 00:37:05,285
I don't know what to say, man. I mean, you saved
my life, and I practically tried to kill you.

534
00:37:05,308 --> 00:37:08,349
Its not the best way
to get this coach-player relationship off the ground.

535
00:37:08,396 --> 00:37:09,289
It's okay.

536
00:37:09,324 --> 00:37:11,741
If you want to bring this to the school's attention,
I totally understand.

537
00:37:11,764 --> 00:37:13,584
No, coach,you weren't yourself.

538
00:37:13,701 --> 00:37:16,249
- I'm just glad it wore off.
- Yeah.

539
00:37:17,787 --> 00:37:19,607
You're gonna do great out there today.

540
00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:22,541
I think after all thats happened,
the guys are finally behind you.

541
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:23,950
Thanks.

542
00:37:26,134 --> 00:37:27,379
Hey, coach...

543
00:37:27,426 --> 00:37:28,985
when you were in my loft,

544
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,416
you told me to stay away from your girl.

545
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,447
Who were you talking about?

546
00:37:35,232 --> 00:37:36,383
Honestly...

547
00:37:37,058 --> 00:37:38,702
I have no idea.

548
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,003
I mean, like you said, I guess I wasn't myself.

549
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:42,541
Good luck today Clark.

550
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,596
I'll see you out there.

551
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:54,135
The crows are behind 31-28

552
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,178
with 7 seconds remaining.

553
00:37:56,213 --> 00:37:59,282
Fourth down and 60 yards from the end zone.

554
00:38:04,848 --> 00:38:06,785
Nate, I need you to get open...

555
00:38:06,821 --> 00:38:07,993
in the end zone.

556
00:38:08,016 --> 00:38:09,378
You serious?

557
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:11,891
- You throw that far?
- Can you run that fast?

558
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,218
Hell, yeah.

559
00:38:14,462 --> 00:38:15,434
Let's do it!

560
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:18,534
- All right, guys. Hail mary on one.
- Hey!

561
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:30,168
42! 42!

562
00:38:30,203 --> 00:38:32,223
29! Hut!

563
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,598
Unbelievable! The Crows win!

564
00:39:05,633 --> 00:39:07,758
The Crows win!

565
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:37,826
Wow, so...

566
00:39:37,861 --> 00:39:41,548
60-yard pass to win the big game
at the last second.

567
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:44,777
You're gonna be, like,some superhero around here.

568
00:39:44,824 --> 00:39:46,994
I just might have to doan article on you.

569
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:49,448
Does that mean you're back at the "torch"?

570
00:39:50,058 --> 00:39:51,103
Yeah.

571
00:39:53,135 --> 00:39:56,550
Since I'm not very good at ignoring 500-pound elephants,
I...

572
00:39:56,571 --> 00:40:00,399
I'm really sorry that I made things
so ridiculously awkward between us.

573
00:40:00,434 --> 00:40:02,266
You know, I thought you made a great cheerleader.

574
00:40:02,278 --> 00:40:05,225
Yeah, let's never talk about that again, okay?

575
00:40:05,348 --> 00:40:06,369
Look, clark,

576
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:09,126
as much as I'd like to blame
the pom-pom juice for this,

577
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,883
I obviously still have those feelings

578
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,574
in me somewhere.

579
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:19,677
Chloe...

580
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,843
I wish I felt the same way,

581
00:40:24,866 --> 00:40:26,402
but I don'T.

582
00:40:28,327 --> 00:40:30,147
At least not right now.

583
00:40:30,441 --> 00:40:31,580
Right.

584
00:40:31,635 --> 00:40:33,074
I know that.

585
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:34,724
And I accept it.

586
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:37,260
I just hope that we can keep our friendship.

587
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,909
Except now you're gonna be,like, big man on campus.

588
00:40:41,543 --> 00:40:44,678
Well, I'm hoping my new editor will keep me in line.

589
00:40:45,806 --> 00:40:47,811
I'm gonna make time for the "torch. "

590
00:40:47,882 --> 00:40:48,880
Wow.

591
00:40:49,737 --> 00:40:51,933
A superhero and journalist.

592
00:40:52,438 --> 00:40:54,387
What are the odds?

593
00:41:02,471 --> 00:41:03,974
I'll see you tomorrow.

594
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,649
If you break her heart,

595
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:13,939
I'll come back and I'll break your legs.

596
00:41:13,962 --> 00:41:15,723
What do you mean,"come back"?

597
00:41:16,158 --> 00:41:21,287
Apparently, the dean got a call from a very
prominent benefactor with the initials "L.L."

598
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:25,126
They did the white manpower dance and shazam...
I'm officially a freshman.

599
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:26,499
Wow, that's great.

600
00:41:27,446 --> 00:41:30,124
Oh, don't pretend you had nothing to do with it.

601
00:41:30,147 --> 00:41:32,848
Why would lex call out of the blue on my behalf?

602
00:41:32,941 --> 00:41:35,970
Look, the important thing is,
you got in and you're leaving.

603
00:41:38,612 --> 00:41:41,031
Because that's what you wanted, right?

604
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:43,893
Yeah, yeah, don't get all broken up about it.

605
00:41:43,929 --> 00:41:47,345
You know, if I could describe my time here in one word,

606
00:41:47,862 --> 00:41:49,327
it would be "weird. "

607
00:41:50,255 --> 00:41:53,237
I look forward to the relative normalcy of the big city.

608
00:41:54,435 --> 00:41:55,809
But don't worry,

609
00:41:56,044 --> 00:41:57,345
Ill visit.

610
00:41:58,167 --> 00:42:00,492
Is that a promise or a threat?

611
00:42:04,554 --> 00:42:05,740
See you around...

612
00:42:05,986 --> 00:42:07,513
"Smallville. "

613
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:25,338
