1
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:13,341
I was under the impression
the deal had closed.

2
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,978
- Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry.
- I don't want "I'm sorry."

3
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,381
I want to know how my father
beat me out of a $ 150 million contract...

4
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,350
...that you assured me was a done deal.

5
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,582
They'd only know the exact amount
if they had inside information.

6
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:29,695
Since we were the only ones who knew it,
and I certainly didn't tell my father...

7
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,263
...that leaves you
in a very uncomfortable position.

8
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:37,301
If I no longer have your confidence,
I'll tender my resignation in the morning.

9
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,603
My father would want
more than your resignation.

10
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,208
He'd hobble you at the knees
and do everything in his power...

11
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,279
...to ensure you'd never work
in the corporate world again.

12
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,280
But I'm not my father.

13
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:59,290
All I want to know is how he found out.

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,291
And how I can stop it from
ever happening again.

15
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,923
Lex, what's going on?

16
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:25,543
Big Brother is listening,
or should I say Big Daddy.

17
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,010
These are just what I've found so far.

18
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,342
State-of-the-art,
high-tech surveillance.

19
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,883
I'll have to get experts
to sweep the rest of the mansion.

20
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:37,079
- Are you saying your dad's spying on you?
- I had a multimillion-dollar contract.

21
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:41,660
The last minute, LuthorCorp manages
to underbid me. You do the math.

22
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,897
- Lex, you gotta calm down...
- Don't tell me to calm down, Clark.

23
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,666
How would you feel if someone listened
to every private word you uttered?

24
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,169
Learning all your secrets?

25
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,117
Lex. These devices could be anywhere.

26
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:17,320
- In the sofa cushions, in the heating vents.
- I already checked.

27
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,128
What about your stereo?

28
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,466
Hey, Dad. Want me
to make this extra-crispy for you?

29
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:40,909
No, thanks. And if I do say so myself,
I've cooked this bird to perfection.

30
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,310
Just the way your mother likes it.

31
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,479
Why aren't you going to Metropolis
for your anniversary?

32
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,780
Well, last year while we were
out of town...

33
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,719
...somebody had a party at our house.

34
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,658
Well, you know what,
I think a picnic sounds perfect.

35
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:58,024
So do I. But I can't go.

36
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,434
Wait a minute, what do you mean
you can't go?

37
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,363
Lionel just called. LuthorCorp's finalizing
a major acquisition tomorrow...

38
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:10,168
...and he needs me to go with him
to his Metropolis office to prepare.

39
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,743
Didn't you tell him
it's your anniversary, Mom?

40
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,675
I'll be back tomorrow night.

41
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,077
We can celebrate then,
any restaurant you want.

42
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,582
Will you put it on your LuthorCorp
expense account?

43
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,276
Oh, Jonathan.

44
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,047
You can't make me feel
any worse about it than I do.

45
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,691
I know how hard you worked
planning today...

46
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,953
...but I don't have a choice. He's my boss.
- I'm your husband.

47
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:35,128
Believe me, I'd much rather
spend today with you.

48
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,868
But this job is important to me.

49
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,701
I never thought I'd see the day where this
job was more important than this family.

50
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,400
- You shouldn't be working for Lionel Luthor.
- Clark.

51
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,638
He only got this major acquisition
because he was spying on Lex.

52
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,579
Clark. This is between
your mother and I.

53
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,121
Jonathan, how many times have you put
this farm above our personal lives?

54
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,723
- That is different, Martha.
- Why?

55
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:04,056
I'm working toward the same goal:
Our family's financial security.

56
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,994
I wish this job
didn't bother you so much.

57
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,840
I have to go.

58
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,725
All right, Lex. What's so urgent?

59
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,656
Remember the new American Embassy
in Moscow, Dad?

60
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,860
It was so riddled with
surveillance hardware...

61
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,057
...the State Department
had to abandon it.

62
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,363
I've got a meeting. I don't have time
to chat about foreign affairs.

63
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,166
Actually, the topic is domestic.

64
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:52,437
I've discovered a bug problem right here
in my very own home.

65
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:56,373
Corporate espionage,
it's a fact of modern business, Lex.

66
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,710
I'm surprised your security was so lax.

67
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:03,652
It's still hard to imagine how the perpetrator
could have gained access to the mansion.

68
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:09,784
Do I detect a faint whiff of innuendo?

69
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,192
Of course not, Dad.

70
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,061
I just wanted to congratulate you
on winning that contract.

71
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:19,568
Oh, is that what this is about?
Making an excuse for your defeat.

72
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:24,074
Because I don't have time for excuses.

73
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,736
As for your bug problem...

74
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,247
...I suggest you call an exterminator.

75
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,576
- This is Mr. Green.
- I've finished the appraisal you requested.

76
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,713
- We're ready to close escrow.
- How soon can you complete it?

77
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:06,477
Today. We're here and ready to roll. You get
full access to the property, audio and video.

78
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,017
Do we have a go?

79
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,382
Mr. Green, are you there?

80
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,023
- Mr. Green.
- Do it.

81
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,558
We're on.

82
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,044
You don't think it's too much?

83
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,951
It depends who you're wearing it for.

84
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,458
What do you call your newly discovered
biological father's wife?

85
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:54,499
Well, personally, I'd call her Mrs. Small,
but that's just me.

86
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,303
- So you're really going to see her.
- Yeah.

87
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:03,602
Kind of feel like I'm auditioning.
What if she votes me off the island?

88
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,947
Lana, anyone who gets to know you
realizes how special you are.

89
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,346
Thanks, Clark.

90
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:18,490
That's really sweet of you to say.

91
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,960
You're always the one telling me
I need to be more honest.

92
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,720
Yeah.

93
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,393
Well, maybe you see me that way
because we're friends.

94
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,969
But to Jennifer Small, I'm just
her husband's illegitimate daughter...

95
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,129
...trying to worm her way into his life.

96
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,234
Lana, if she accepts you, then great.
But if not, that's her loss.

97
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,744
Isn't your priority Henry?
That's been going well.

98
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,541
Yeah.

99
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,878
But maybe it's the whole
"adopted kid fantasy" thing...

100
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:51,182
...but I can't help thinking that
if I don't screw it up...

101
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,188
...I might have an actual family.

102
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,890
Look, Lana, I want you to have
everything you wish for, I really do.

103
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,523
Just because you have a family
doesn't mean every day is a picnic.

104
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,302
Unless, of course, you're a Kent.

105
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,940
Well, to be honest, my parents aren't
really getting along right now.

106
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:14,109
I'm sorry, Clark.
Do you want to talk about it?

107
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,409
Later. You've got someplace to be.

108
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,682
Okay.

109
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,121
Clark.

110
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,556
Whatever it is,
your parents will work it out.

111
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:40,164
After all, some people
are just meant to be together.

112
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:59,918
Lex. What's the most romantic restaurant
in Metropolis?

113
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,791
I'm sure there are a lot opinions
on that, Clark...

114
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,522
...but personally,
I'd have to go with La Petite Fleur.

115
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,723
Could you score me a reservation
for tonight?

116
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,267
- Who's the lucky girl?
- My mom. It's my parents' anniversary.

117
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,895
My dad had a picnic,
but now she's in Metropolis with your dad.

118
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,168
They're in Metropolis? At LuthorCorp?
On a Sunday?

119
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,144
Yeah. Can you believe that he makes
her work on her anniversary?

120
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:25,340
To my father, there's no such thing
as a personal life. Listen...

121
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,612
...since it's their anniversary,
I could do better than reservations.

122
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,653
What do you have in mind?

123
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:34,156
Well, if you excuse me a minute
to make a few calls, I'll explain.

124
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,101
Accessing database.

125
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,643
- Kern.
- This is Green.

126
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,280
I want you to terminate. Now.

127
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:33,509
- You realize you'll forfeit the deposit.
- There are people in there. I want you out.

128
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,347
I understand.

129
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:43,191
Our client has canceled the project.
He believes there are people in the building.

130
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,927
Hey, what are you doing?

131
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,299
You think we broke into the office of one of
the richest men in the world to plant bugs?

132
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,409
We ain't leaving this place
until we empty that vault.

133
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,037
Bishop.

134
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,314
Nicky. How long have
we worked together?

135
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,511
We're not thieves.
We were hired to do a specific job.

136
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,483
Job description's just been changed.

137
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,494
Go out and check the other offices.
Bishop, get the torch.

138
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,396
Sign here.

139
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,631
Okay.

140
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,005
- Martha?
- Yes.

141
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,875
- Is something wrong?
- No.

142
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,922
It's just that when you said
work couldn't wait till Monday...

143
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,148
...I didn't think I'd be
the only one here.

144
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,158
Thought you'd like to work
in your new office.

145
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,397
New office? I don't understand.

146
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:57,866
Look inside the top left-hand drawer
of the desk.

147
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,607
Go ahead. Open it.

148
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,594
Turn it over.

149
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:34,401
"To Martha, with deep affection: L.L."

150
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:40,677
I'm promoting you, Martha, which means
I'll be needing you more in Metropolis.

151
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,906
Which means you'll need
someplace to work.

152
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,715
Lionel...

153
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:51,885
...I'm flattered, really,
but I can't accept this.

154
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,687
And as far as working in Metropolis...

155
00:14:56,862 --> 00:15:00,889
...this job is putting enough strain
on my family as it is.

156
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,707
Martha.

157
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:15,904
I know how much you've given
up to be...

158
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,851
...a farmer's wife,
but with your brains and your talent...

159
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:25,321
...don't you deserve to make
your own ambitions a priority for a change?

160
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,649
We'll discuss it over dinner.

161
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,222
Hey, love birds.
Wrong place, wrong time.

162
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,564
- Who is this? Martha?
- I don't know.

163
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:41,172
Put your hands up.
Let's go! Get them in the air! Now!

164
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:47,208
Clark. Clark!

165
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,837
I don't suppose you know why there's
a helicopter parked in our front yard.

166
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:54,076
Lex is gonna take you to Metropolis.
So you can take Mom to dinner.

167
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,811
So this was your idea, was it?

168
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:59,186
It was Clark's. I just offered
to provide the transportation.

169
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,849
Look, I don't know how things work
in your house...

170
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,996
...but we think it's important
to respect other people's privacy.

171
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,562
- Dad.
- It's all right, Clark.

172
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:13,665
Mr. Kent. Since the day
I moved to Smallville...

173
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,307
...I've done nothing but try
to be a friend to you.

174
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:21,473
And in return, you do nothing but lecture
me with sanctimonious platitudes.

175
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,579
I'm done listening to them.

176
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,723
- Dad, that was not fair.
- Everything was fine in this family...

177
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,223
...until we let the Luthors
into our lives.

178
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,421
- That wasn't Lex's fault.
- Hey!

179
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:42,556
I appreciate your concern, but it is not
your responsibility to fix everything.

180
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,232
So just stay out of it.

181
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,761
Hey, Pyne. Got a little present for you.
Lionel Luthor.

182
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:16,634
Good, you just saved us a whole lot of time.
Get him to open the vault.

183
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,602
Too late, genius.
You already burned the plate.

184
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,448
Access: Section Two.

185
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,820
How the hell did the cops get tipped off?

186
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,470
What have you got in your hand?

187
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:56,699
- Open it up.
- Stop, you're hurting him. Lionel, please.

188
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,178
Panic button, state of the art.

189
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,049
Check him out.

190
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,850
Let's go. Come on.

191
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:15,217
A man in my position can never take
too many precautions.

192
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,861
Why don't you just let us go?

193
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,725
You can avoid adding kidnapping
to breaking and entering.

194
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:23,527
You should listen to this woman.
I find her advice invariably sound.

195
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,829
- I think he's all right.
- We should have left.

196
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:29,303
If you'd kept to the plan,
none of this would have happened.

197
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,811
- What's wrong with you?!
- Are you crazy?

198
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,541
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

199
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,050
- What are you doing?!
- Shut up!

200
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,848
- Shut up!
- Drop it now!

201
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:48,391
All right. All right, all right, all right.
Let's just settle down, okay?

202
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,653
- Drop it, Pyne.
- Just relax.

203
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:54,128
All right. Relax. Let's take it easy.

204
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,395
I'm gonna put my guns down.
All right?

205
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,028
Just gonna get the money,
and we're gonna get the hell out of here.

206
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,945
Get back to work on that vault.

207
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,113
You're wasting your time, you know.

208
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,688
There's nothing in there of value
to any of you.

209
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,726
Keep your eyes on them.
We'll need them later for leverage.

210
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,671
- More coffee?
- Henry, why don't you get it?

211
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:49,151
- Give Lana and I a chance to get a word in.
- Sure, I'll be right back.

212
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,086
This really is a cute place, Lana.

213
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,924
- You've got great taste.
- Thank you.

214
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,127
And thank you for agreeing to meet with me.
I know it can't be easy for you.

215
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,574
Lana, you seem like a very together
young woman...

216
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:14,144
...which is why I feel
I can be completely candid with you.

217
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,445
I don't want you
getting too close to Henry.

218
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,587
Mrs. Small, I don't know
what you think...

219
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,589
...but I am not trying to interfere
with your family.

220
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,353
That's not what I'm worried about.

221
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:35,361
Lana, when I married Henry,
he was the editor of the Law Review.

222
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,798
He was gonna run for Congress.

223
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,337
Now he runs a law practice
for lost causes out of our living room.

224
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,939
He believes in what he's doing.

225
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:47,511
Yeah, until it gets too difficult
or he loses interest.

226
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,113
Which he always does.

227
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,316
You think he'll lose interest in me.

228
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:59,787
Henry has two children in boarding school.
He never calls them.

229
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,292
And even when they're home,
he doesn't have time for them.

230
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,991
Or anyone else.

231
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,161
Why are you telling me this?

232
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,868
I'm trying to do you a favor.

233
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:19,306
I do not want to see you get hurt the next
time Henry's priorities suddenly change.

234
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,414
So...

235
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,213
...what have you two ladies
been talking about?

236
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,887
We are live at the LuthorCorp Tower,
where sometime earlier this afternoon...

237
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:42,192
...armed gunmen apparently entered
the building, and are now...

238
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:46,360
...holding LuthorCorp chairman
and CEO Lionel Luthor hostage...

239
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:50,338
...along with at least one
unidentified female employee.

240
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,773
- Mom.
- Lf anybody tries to hurt your mother...

241
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,435
- I'm not gonna let that happen.
- Clark. Clark!

242
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,883
I'm not gonna try and stop you,
but I want you to be careful.

243
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,681
I'm gonna follow you in the truck
and get there soon.

244
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:09,020
Dad, there's a faster way for you to get
to Metropolis. You just have to talk to Lex.

245
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,066
Get him out of here.

246
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:29,207
- What?
- I hired you to bug an office...

247
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:33,715
...not create a media circus.
- Yeah? Well, we ran into a little snag.

248
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:37,685
- Who is this?
- Tell you what, Mr. Green.

249
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,723
You show me your caller ID
and I'll show you mine.

250
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:46,455
- I want to talk to Kern now.
- Kern's definitely not in charge anymore.

251
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,373
Mr. Kent.

252
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,243
I take it you've seen the news.

253
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:07,084
If I hadn't been so bull-headed...

254
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,487
...and taken you up on your offer...

255
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:14,554
...Martha and I'd probably be
on our way to dinner.

256
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,591
Instead...

257
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,762
Believe me.

258
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,367
There's plenty of blame to go around.

259
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,142
Lex, I was wondering...

260
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,280
- I was wondering if l...
- Sure, Mr. Kent.

261
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,483
I'll give you a helicopter ride
to Metropolis.

262
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,554
Young man, you too.
Stay behind the barricade.

263
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,818
Let's go.

264
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,036
Stand up and put your hands
on your head.

265
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,296
Stand up!

266
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:37,569
Turn around.

267
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:40,835
I can explain.

268
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:44,179
Hold still. Keep your fingers linked.

269
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,978
I'm listening.

270
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:50,277
My name is Clark Kent.
My mom's a hostage being held up there.

271
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:53,049
Thought you'd play hero?
Assuming you're who you say...

272
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:57,025
...you almost got your mom killed.
Every opening in there is wired with alarms.

273
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,163
The kidnappers control
the security system.

274
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,199
And they've threatened to shoot hostages
if anyone so much as sets a big toe inside.

275
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,197
Come on, hero.
You're coming with me.

276
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,662
Move it!

277
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,374
So, what are we gonna do?
They saw you kill Kern.

278
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,482
They can ID us, Pyne.

279
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,312
And I for one am not going down
for murder. Understand me?

280
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:24,649
We will deal with them
when the time comes.

281
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,688
I know what you're thinking.

282
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:35,890
If I hadn't asked you to work today, you'd
be at home right now with your family.

283
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,963
I don't blame you, Lionel.

284
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:43,770
It's just that Jonathan and I
left on such bad terms.

285
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:50,673
That's ironic. I had quite a row
this morning too with Lex.

286
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,280
If they kill us...

287
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:56,610
...those will be the last words
we ever spoke to each other.

288
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,359
Pyne, you're up.

289
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,602
What the hell is this?

290
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,680
I want you to monitor the radio channels.
Nothing gets...

291
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:05,084
It's okay. It's okay.

292
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,048
Clark?

293
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:10,822
- You know this kid?
- Yes, ma'am. He's my son.

294
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:14,932
Okay, you keep him away from the building
or I'll arrest him. All right?

295
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,096
- Lieutenant, I'm...
- I know who you are.

296
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:20,032
I'd appreciate an update
on the negotiations.

297
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,369
This way.

298
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,647
- What happened?
- I listened to the police.

299
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,214
- I found a way into the building.
- Really, how?

300
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,750
No one's watching the Daily Planet.

301
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,124
- You're not thinking about jumping.
- It's the only way.

302
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,956
- Clark, that's gotta be over 200 feet.
- I can make it.

303
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,361
You don't know that.

304
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:52,926
- Besides, don't you have a fear of heights?
- Lf we're not here to get Mom, then why?

305
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:57,434
Listen to me. I am just as concerned
about your mother as you are.

306
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,976
But we can't afford to make a mistake
that could get her killed.

307
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,795
Where's the damn money?

308
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:24,457
I told you there was nothing
in there of interest to you.

309
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,943
Check this out.

310
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,348
Could be worth something.

311
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,709
What the hell is this?

312
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:13,216
Martha, perhaps the gentleman
hasn't noticed...

313
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:14,908
...that I'm blind.

314
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,647
Would you mind telling me
what he's referring to?

315
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,491
It's...

316
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,324
...some sort of metallic disk,
shaped like an octagon.

317
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:30,462
It's nothing, a keepsake.

318
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:50,048
- Sawyer.
- Where is my transportation?

319
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:54,851
I told you, I need a show of good faith first.
You give me one of those hostages.

320
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,017
Okay.

321
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,529
Fine.

322
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,695
Get up.

323
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:09,039
You got 10 minutes, then you can
take this one out in a body bag.

324
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:13,803
We're working on it. Stay cool up there.
Stay cool.

325
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:07,087
Whatever you do, don't hurt any
of the hostages. Just stay calm.

326
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,266
Yeah, well, how am I supposed
to stay calm, huh?

327
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,736
I opened up that damn vault expecting
my retirement fund...

328
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:18,239
...and instead I find a bunch of files,
green rocks all cut up into bars.

329
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,775
- What else was in there?
- What's it to you?

330
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:23,641
Answer me and maybe I can help you.

331
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,747
I don't know. Just what I told you.

332
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,853
Oh, and some metal
octagon-Iooking thing.

333
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:36,216
Listen to me. Pack up everything.
The files, the bars, the octagon.

334
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,622
Yeah, then what?

335
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:43,293
I know a way out of the building.
But first, you let the hostages go.

336
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,517
Pyne?

337
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,683
Better take a look at this.

338
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,298
- We got company.
- Check it out.

339
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:30,068
A window just blew out on the 30th floor.
Get the team together, we're going in.

340
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,209
Let's go. Move it.

341
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,775
What the hell's going on?

342
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:41,043
Sounds like a chunk in that safe
is worth something to you.

343
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:45,212
Tell you what, I want a million dollars
and I want a way out of here.

344
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,884
- You're in no position to negotiate.
- This is not a negotiation. All right?

345
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,894
We get out of here or nobody does.

346
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,926
All right, listen to me.

347
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,329
Luthor has a private elevator.

348
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:03,167
It'll take you to a tunnel that leads
to a garage three blocks away.

349
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,504
Hey, Lionel. You been holding out on me?

350
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:09,407
Is there some kind of secret way
out of here?

351
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,480
Oh, yes.

352
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:18,151
And whatever that anonymous coward,
your Mr. Green, is offering...

353
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,319
...I'll double it...

354
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,658
...in exchange for our lives...

355
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,319
...and the contents of the safe.

356
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:31,291
Hear that, Green? Looks like
we got us a bidding war.

357
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,302
Look, no matter what Luthor is promising,
you can't trust him.

358
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:39,375
Oh, but I should trust you?
Somebody who hides his own identity?

359
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,340
Think I'd rather deal with Lionel.

360
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,141
I'll match what he's offering,
just don't hurt them.

361
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,882
Don't hurt who, Lex?

362
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,165
- Were you talking to those men up there?
- Mr. Kent...

363
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:10,535
...whatever I'm doing is in the best interest
of your wife and my father. Believe me.

364
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:15,237
If I find out that you had anything to do
with what's going on out here...

365
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:19,807
...you will pray to God you never set
foot in Smallville. You believe me.

366
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,272
Where's my mom? Where is she?!

367
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:52,983
So as soon as the banks open,
I'll have the money wired...

368
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,614
...to any account you choose,
anywhere in the world.

369
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,155
- All right, we got a deal.
- Good.

370
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,851
But I'm hanging on to everything
till I get that money.

371
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,990
All right.

372
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,626
Bishop, pack up the stuff in the vault.

373
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:15,135
So you'll tell who's on
the other end of the line?

374
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:19,072
You'd probably know better than I do.
Why don't you think who your enemies are?

375
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,873
Come on, lady, you can help out too.
Pick up the files.

376
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,080
Come on!

377
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:38,756
Today! Come on!

378
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:44,061
- Pick them up and put them with the rest.
- Okay, I'm picking them up. I...

379
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,970
All right, that's good.
Get over there and help your boss up.

380
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,273
Lionel.

381
00:36:56,614 --> 00:37:02,018
- Martha. The octagonal disk, where is it?
- I don't know. Why is it so important?

382
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,746
Come on, time's up. Let's go. Move.

383
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,321
Move, move!

384
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,595
What the hell happened?

385
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:16,392
The cops cut the power.
We've gotta go!

386
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,296
Bishop, don't!

387
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:30,035
Clark! Get out of here now!

388
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:36,349
Clark!

389
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,991
Clark!

390
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,338
Are you alone?

391
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:01,938
Answer me, are you alone?

392
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:22,392
Clark! Clark. Are you all right?

393
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:29,370
Lady, you and the kid get up, put your
hands over your head, or I kill the old man.

394
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,927
He's dead.

395
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,538
Clark. Those files over there, burn them.

396
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:05,671
There's one about you.
We can't let it get out.

397
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:22,315
Metropolis P.D., nobody move!
Hands where I can see them!

398
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,490
Clark.

399
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:07,330
- How did you get inside?
- The boy's resourceful, Lex.

400
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:12,135
What difference does it make how he did it?
He saved us, that's what's important.

401
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,038
Dad.

402
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:17,610
I did everything I could
to secure your release.

403
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:20,876
No, I'm sure you did a great deal.

404
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,747
I'll send someone to the mansion
for my things.

405
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,619
I'll help them pack.

406
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,560
Thank you.

407
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,478
- What's that?
- It's my resignation.

408
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,817
There's no way I can keep working
for Lionel.

409
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:32,945
He had refined meteor rocks in his vault,
a file on Clark. I can't believe I trusted him.

410
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:36,456
Without that file, at least the police
can't find out anything about me.

411
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:39,625
To think I made this job
such a big priority...

412
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:43,460
...and Lionel may have only hired me
to learn more about Clark.

413
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:48,468
Sorry, Mom. I know how important
your work has been to you.

414
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,374
It's not more important than you.

415
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,271
Wait.

416
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:57,679
Are you sure that this
is the best thing to do?

417
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:59,609
- Quit, I mean.
- What do you mean?

418
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,375
I thought you'd be happy about it.

419
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,717
If you hadn't been working
for Lionel...

420
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:07,619
...then we'd have no way of knowing
that he was keeping tabs on Clark.

421
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,391
So instead of staying away
from him...

422
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:13,553
Maybe we should take a page
out of the Luthor playbook.

423
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:48,125
- Sweetheart. You coming up?
- In a minute.
