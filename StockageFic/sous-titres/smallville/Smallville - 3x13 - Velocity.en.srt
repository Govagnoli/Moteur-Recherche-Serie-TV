1
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,223
Dad?

2
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,191
Sweetheart?

3
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,693
How are you feeling?

4
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,030
Are you two still here?

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,000
I think you need to go back.
Back home and get some rest.

6
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,537
Hey, Clark.

7
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,779
Don't worry about me, son.

8
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:53,476
It's gonna take a whole lot more than
a heart attack to keep your old man down.

9
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,380
I just feel like this is all my fault.

10
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,320
Hey. Come here.

11
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,438
Look, there's a lot of things
that you can do...

12
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,576
...but causing cardiac arrest
is not one of them.

13
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,514
Last time you were at the doctor's,
they said you had a heart of a 20-year-old...

14
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:29,849
-...just before I went to Metropolis--
-lf you're suggesting your biological father--

15
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:34,653
He gave you powers humans weren't meant
to have. Your heart can't handle it.

16
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,092
Clark, no, there were other factors.

17
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,992
If I hadn't put on that ring...

18
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:43,192
...and abandoned you and Mom when you
needed me most, you wouldn't be lying here.

19
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,361
As hard as this is for you
to believe...

20
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:51,140
...not everything that goes wrong
in Smallville is Clark Kent's fault.

21
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,477
Watch out!

22
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,287
-Where are you going?
-They're gonna kill someone.

23
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:08,546
Ladies and gentlemen!
Your reigning king of speed:

24
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,087
Pete "The Boss" Ross!

25
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:30,358
Whoa, Dante,
that's some serious green.

26
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:34,700
All right, I jacked up the meteor-rock ratio
in this new batch of nitrous, okay?

27
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:39,437
You ought to be working for NASA, man.
These cars are gonna be like rockets.

28
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,409
Hey, Pete.

29
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,742
Clark, what are you doing here?

30
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,613
Hey, nice ride, man.

31
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:51,214
What's that thing do, like,
0 to 60 in an hour?

32
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:56,627
Hey, you ever wanna turn that tortoise
into a hare, give me a call.

33
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,192
See you, bro.

34
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,537
How's your dad?

35
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:12,239
He's okay, but in case you didn't notice,
you almost obliterated our truck last night.

36
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:16,178
-My mom was behind the wheel.
-I'm sorry if I scared your mom, Clark...

37
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:20,046
...but, I swear, I was in complete control
the whole time.

38
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,150
-At 1 00 miles an hour?
-You're not exactly one to talk...

39
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,120
...about breaking the speed limit.

40
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,522
You know what it's like to move so fast
that nothing can touch you.

41
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:32,791
For me, this is as close as I can get.

42
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:42,533
-How long have you been doing this?
-I don't know. Couple months.

43
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,700
Why didn't you tell me about it?

44
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,505
Because I knew you'd ground me
and take away my allowance.

45
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,205
Pete, this isn't a joke.
You could really hurt someone.

46
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,978
Clark, I know how to handle
these cars.

47
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:56,212
Dante's the best driver.
He's taught me everything he knows.

48
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,381
Including how to break the law.
Street racing is illegal.

49
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:03,290
-You could go to jail.
-Not if no one finds out.

50
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,761
You're good at keeping secrets, Clark.

51
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:09,868
You're not gonna tell anybody. Right?

52
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,702
They say everyone's got someone
that looks like him.

53
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,338
Chad Nash doesn't just look like you.

54
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,853
Karate team, orchestra, computer club.

55
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:32,957
All things that you just happen
to be a master of?

56
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:39,059
According to this article, you died
five months ago of a rare liver disease...

57
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,429
...and suddenly you're standing in front
of me with a different name?

58
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,160
-Who else has seen this?
-No one.

59
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,567
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

60
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,100
Adam, tell me what's going on.

61
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,936
Lana, you can't tell anyone.

62
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:57,549
You have to promise me
you'll keep this a secret.

63
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,922
Adam, your eye.

64
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,452
It happens all the time.

65
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,492
-It's just a broken capillary.
-Are you sure you're okay?

66
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,430
It's nothing. I'm fine.

67
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:21,096
Lana, listen, you have to promise me you're
not gonna tell anyone about this, okay?

68
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,435
-Adam--
-My life could depend on it.

69
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,067
Please, promise me
you won't say a word.

70
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,005
So I've been following up
on our mysterious tenant in the Talon.

71
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:02,636
It seems he has an intimate relationship
with needles.

72
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,613
I take it you're not talking
about embroidery?

73
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,015
Hardly.
I found a vial in his apartment...

74
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:11,623
...and took it to the pathologist
at Smallville Med to have it analyzed.

75
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,955
Well, what is it?

76
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:18,889
It's a serum that contains minute amounts
of cells resembling blood platelets.

77
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,898
Now, what's even freakier
is the molecular makeup...

78
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:26,732
...is like nothing the pathologist
has ever seen in any human or animal.

79
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,408
That's why I decided to take a peek
into Adam's medical records.

80
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,581
Privacy laws don't seem
to faze you much, do they?

81
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,584
Not when I'm worried about
one of my best friends.

82
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,244
As long as Lana has The Talented
Mr. Ripley living above her...

83
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:46,323
...I'll do whatever it takes
to make sure he's not dangerous.

84
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,359
-ls he?
-I don't know.

85
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,659
I know that when he was in the hospital,
he had a doctor visiting him twice a week.

86
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,824
Well, that doesn't sound
very unusual to me.

87
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,466
It is when it's not an M.D.

88
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:03,575
Dr. Teng is a professor of molecular biology
at Metropolis University.

89
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,872
-Have you been following up with him?
-"Him" is a her...

90
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:11,779
...and she's so high up in the ivory tower
I'd need a ladder. That's why I came to you.

91
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:17,751
A generous benefactor of the university will
have more luck than a high school student.

92
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,755
Have you mentioned
any of this to Lana?

93
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,722
I didn't wanna say anything
until I found out all the facts.

94
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,228
Let's keep it that way.

95
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:53,555
What are you doing? If I'd hit you, I'd have
totaled this car and it's not even mine.

96
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,627
-Slow down, you wouldn't have a problem.
-When did you become a cop?

97
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:00,732
Since you started racing kryptonite-fueled
cars that can break the sound barrier.

98
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,731
-Don't I wish.
-Pete, listen to me.

99
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,462
There have been a series
of fatal car accidents this year.

100
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,936
They all had the same
kryptonite booster tanks.

101
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,702
Clark, any car can be dangerous if you
don't know how to drive it.

102
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,674
-But I do.
-That's not the point.

103
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,279
Yes, it is.

104
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:19,684
For once in my life, I finally found
something that I'm truly good at.

105
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,184
What are you talking about?
You're good at a lot of things.

106
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:25,186
-Like what?
-Like basketball. You got a killer jump shot.

107
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,850
-You've beaten me plenty of times.
-Yeah, when you're not using your powers.

108
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:33,727
Clark, I'm okay at hoops.
I'm a decent photographer.

109
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,302
But you saw that crowd last night.
You heard them chanting my name...

110
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:43,272
...and for once in my life, I finally get
to feel what you feel like every single day.

111
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,205
I get to feel special.

112
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,684
-Pete, I'm not special. I'm different.
-Clark, who do you think you're kidding?

113
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:57,311
You can do things
that I can never even dream of.

114
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:02,761
And ever since we were kids,
even before I knew your secret...

115
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,453
-...I've been walking in your shadow.
-That's not true.

116
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:09,624
Clark, don't get me wrong.
It's not a bad place to be.

117
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,997
But I'm growing up.

118
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,639
I'm realizing that
I got my own talents.

119
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,469
Pete, I can't let you race anymore.
It's too dangerous.

120
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:21,545
Clark, what are you gonna do,
physically stop me every time I go to race?

121
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,938
If I have to!

122
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,487
Fine, Clark, you win.

123
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,886
I guess I'll just keep living
vicariously through you.

124
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:55,645
-Doctor--
-It's rookie season--

125
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,443
-Hey.
-You look like you're feeling better.

126
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,315
Yeah. They need to give this room
to somebody really sick.

127
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,287
-I got a farm to run.
-Everything's taken care of.

128
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,656
You need to concentrate on feeling better
and your checkers strategy.

129
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,662
-Not necessarily in that order.
-You've been here every night.

130
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,300
Why don't you go out with your friends,
have some fun.

131
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,062
Why would I go out
when I can beat my dad at checkers?

132
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,934
I'm serious. Listen, just because I'm
stuck in here doesn't mean you need to be.

133
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,600
Why don't you call Pete?
Go to the movies. I'll watch TV.

134
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,178
Pete has other plans.

135
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,807
You two all right?

136
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,555
He's been hanging out
with a different crowd lately.

137
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:43,228
Wait a minute.
When you say "different," you mean...

138
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,192
...wrong?

139
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,759
Without realizing it,
I think I've taken Pete for granted.

140
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,795
Well, you and Pete have been friends
since the sandbox, son.

141
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:59,911
Maybe he's just going through a phase.
As long as he's not getting into trouble...

142
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,070
...give it some time.

143
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,760
-How you feeling, Boss?
-Like I'm about to own the road.

144
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,762
All right.

145
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,563
Look, you're gonna
have to shift gears.

146
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,968
-What do you mean?
-It's time to take a dive.

147
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,405
No winning streak lasts forever, okay?
You're 6-0.

148
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,913
That's the best driver this county's
seen since yours truly.

149
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,176
Now, that means
all the money's on you.

150
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,651
-So?
-So that's a lot of bucks if you lose.

151
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:49,727
So all that stuff about the beauty of racing
and the triumph of victory, that was all lies?

152
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,693
No, hell no.
I meant every word of that.

153
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:56,392
This is the beauty of racing,
Dante style.

154
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,332
See you at the finish line.

155
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,141
This is for good luck.

156
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,479
Not that you need it.

157
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,054
Congratulations, Boss.

158
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,556
Oh, thank you. Hey, Dante, look.
About that whole cheating thing...

159
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,923
-...it's, like, I didn't have it in me.
-Yeah, it isn't in you?

160
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,621
What do you think this is?
A little game of Hot Wheels?

161
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,824
I'm out $20,000 because of you.

162
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,299
-Sorry.
-Sorry's not gonna cut it.

163
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:44,706
So you're gonna give me the keys to my car.
You're gonna pay me my 20 G's...

164
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,607
...and I never wanna see
your face again.

165
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,947
Dante, where am I gonna get $20,000?

166
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,482
Oh, you're gonna figure it out.

167
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,613
Because if you don't...

168
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:02,653
...the only car you're gonna be
driving in is a hearse.

169
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:33,482
-Hey, how's your dad?
-He'll be better once we get him home.

170
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,524
Look, I gotta run.
His room's right around the corner.

171
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:39,994
-He'll be happy to see you.
-Clark.

172
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,227
Have you, by any chance, seen Adam?

173
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,706
Is everything all right?

174
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:55,371
I just hope your dad
likes the balloons.

175
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:58,744
It was either these
or the "get well" teddy bear.

176
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,350
He'll love them.

177
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,724
I'm gonna go.

178
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,923
Bye.

179
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,404
Dr. Teng.

180
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:31,944
If you'd bothered to read the sign, you'd
know my office hours don't begin until 5.

181
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,210
I'm not a student, doctor.
I'm LeX Luthor.

182
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,518
Am I supposed to be impressed?

183
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,089
Even the chancellor makes an appointment
before he interrupts my work.

184
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,161
I've heard you like to play doctor.

185
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,865
Think I can get a checkup?

186
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,567
I don't give physicals, Mr. Luthor.

187
00:17:55,741 --> 00:18:00,303
Nor do I see any patients.
I'm a research scientist.

188
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,743
What about Adam Knight?

189
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,411
Isn't he a patient?

190
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,850
-I told you. I don't--
-I just don't understand...

191
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,820
...why a world-renowned
molecular biologist...

192
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:16,722
...would pay regular visits to a patient
in a small-town hospital.

193
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,830
The amount of money your family
funnels into this university...

194
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:23,798
...does not grant you the right
to storm in here and interrogate me.

195
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:27,132
Now, if you'll eXcuse me,
I have work to do.

196
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:36,575
Does that work happen to involve
blood platelets of unknown origin?

197
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,146
I think you've seen one too many
sci-fi movies, Mr. Luthor.

198
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:50,159
No. I've simply been fascinated with the
mysteries of hematology for some time.

199
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,958
NeXt time, I'll be sure to call first.

200
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,730
I wouldn't wanna interrupt
a moment of inspiration.

201
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,757
From the way your dad's going off
about Kansas State's free throws...

202
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,417
...I wouldn't know
he had a heart attack.

203
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,392
It's nice of you to stop by, Pete.

204
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:29,022
Clark, I've known your dad
almost as long as I've known my own.

205
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,534
-How you holding up?
-lt was tough the first couple days...

206
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:35,867
...but now that he's out of the woods,
I'm doing okay.

207
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,874
Your dad's the strongest guy I know
beside you.

208
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,103
He's gonna be fine.

209
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,611
I better get going.

210
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,978
Pete, are you okay?

211
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:54,091
Clark, you got enough on your plate
without me adding to it.

212
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,888
Pete!

213
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,157
Don't worry about me.

214
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,165
What's going on?

215
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,161
Dante asked me to throw a race,
and I couldn't do it.

216
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:11,708
Now he's threatening to kill me unless
I pay him the money that he lost in bets.

217
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,445
How much is it?

218
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,548
Twenty thousand dollars.

219
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,513
Clark, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

220
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,722
All right, look.
You're just gonna lay low for now.

221
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,192
I'll figure something out.

222
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:13,160
So you think Dante's more
grand-theft auto than lndy 500, huh?

223
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:18,071
Why else would he have a collection
of license plates with new registrations?

224
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:23,271
Journalistic obsessions aside, it seems like
you have a vested interest in this story.

225
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,212
You know how it is.
Once you start on a really good story...

226
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,183
...you can't stop
until you get to the bottom.

227
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,189
I just chatted with the motorheads
up in auto shop.

228
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,023
Your source wouldn't happen to be
Pete "The Boss" Ross, would it?

229
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,667
I understand protecting your source...

230
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:48,932
...but we're talking about Pete risking his life
every time he goes for the checkered flag.

231
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,667
Pete asked me to keep it secret.
I'm keeping my word.

232
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:56,177
Yeah, but you of all people should know
that when your friend is being reckless...

233
00:21:56,348 --> 00:22:00,079
...sometimes keeping a secret hurts
more than it helps.

234
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:04,154
He needs a friend.
Now, Pete might listen to me.

235
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:09,215
-What's that supposed to mean?
-It's called sibling rivalry.

236
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,157
You and Pete are practically brothers.

237
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,627
Now, from what I've heard...

238
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,290
...sometimes it's difficult to take
advice from your sibling.

239
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:28,739
You were right about Jason Dante.
He could be the poster boy for LoJack.

240
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:32,213
All of the VlN numbers you took down
are for stolen cars.

241
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:36,286
That's all the evidence we need.
I'm gonna go talk to the sheriff.

242
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,767
County sheriff!
Hands where I can see them!

243
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,565
Drop that drill. Now!

244
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,939
Good work, Mr. Kent.

245
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:09,918
It only took eight deputies
and four cruisers...

246
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:13,489
...to discover that that barn
was as clean as my grandma's pantry.

247
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,216
But I saw those license plates.

248
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,091
The only plates in that barn
were the ones in the kitchenette sink.

249
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:23,524
And none of the cars in there had VlN
numbers similar to the ones you gave me.

250
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:26,034
-Sheriff, that's impossible.
-As usual, Mr. Kent...

251
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:30,032
...your information's about as accurate
as the local weatherman.

252
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,301
But I'm cutting you some slack
this time...

253
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:37,608
...because I've had my eye on Jason Dante
for a while now, and he is one slippery fish.

254
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:43,011
Next time you say
there's a storm a-brewing, Mr. Kent...

255
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,713
...I'd better see some rain.

256
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,009
Pete?

257
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,411
What happened to you?

258
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:20,617
Dante thought I was the one
that called the sheriff.

259
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,953
It was you.

260
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:29,427
Dante knew about the raid,
because he's got a deputy in his pocket.

261
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:35,264
That's why he never gets busted.

262
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,911
-Let's get you inside and clean you up.
-Clark, I'll be fine.

263
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,481
I just need you to get me
that $20,000.

264
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,641
How am I gonna come up with
that much money?

265
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,547
Go Kal on an ATM machine.

266
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,048
-You've done it before.
-When I was on red kryptonite.

267
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,717
-Then go slip on a ring.
-Pete, I can't do that.

268
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,857
Clark, you don't get it.

269
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:04,160
Dante's a psycho.

270
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,804
He told me he's gonna kill
my parents first...

271
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:10,305
...and then if I still don't pay up,
he's gonna come after me.

272
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,439
Pete, you know I'd never let anything
happen to you or your family.

273
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:19,511
-But it doesn't mean I need to break the law.
-That's never bothered you before.

274
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,845
We've broken into so many buildings.

275
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,423
-We were trying to help people--
-And now I'm the one that needs help. Me!

276
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:37,927
Clark, if you beat him up,
he's just gonna come after us later.

277
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,128
You're not gonna kill him,
and let's face it.

278
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,103
You can't be on secret-service
detail forever.

279
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,402
I gotta put an end to this.

280
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:56,713
-There's gotta be another way.
-Clark! It's my family we're talking about.

281
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:05,323
If you don't give me that cash,
we're dead.

282
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,600
Clark, you just caught me.
I was on my way out to a meeting.

283
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,974
-Did your dad get the DVD player?
-Thanks, Lex. That was nice of you.

284
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:25,014
-He really enjoyed those Westerns.
-I figured he would.

285
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,651
I hope he feels better soon.

286
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,219
You've done so much already,
but I need a big favor.

287
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:34,722
-Name it.
-I need $20,000 cash.

288
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:40,261
You're right. That is big.
You mind telling me what it's for?

289
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:45,601
My friend got mixed up with the wrong
crowd. Now they're making him pay for it.

290
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,234
Is this the old proverbial friend
who happens to be you?

291
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:53,400
Believe me, if that was the case,
it'd be a lot easier.

292
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,981
Well, tell your friend that, in my experience,
money-hungry thugs are like stray dogs.

293
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:04,281
You feed them once, they're at your
back door every night asking for more.

294
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,953
LeX.

295
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:14,595
Unfortunately, I don't think my friend has
a choice. They're threatening to kill him.

296
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,461
Mr. Luthor, chopper's waiting.

297
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,331
Be careful.

298
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,607
Here's your $20,000.

299
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,803
This car is worth
a lot more than that.

300
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,006
-LeX gave it to you?
-Not eXactly.

301
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,242
-You stole it?
-I plan on giving it back...

302
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,081
...after you challenge Dante to a race
he can't say no to.

303
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:13,588
-What are you talking about?
-lf he wins, the Porsche is his.

304
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,851
If you win, your debt is settled.

305
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,725
Whole problem is,
as fast as this thing moves...

306
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,264
...it can't stand a chance
versus Dante's car.

307
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:25,301
No, this is the prize.
You'll drive the car you always drive.

308
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,303
-And you're gonna win.
-Well, I appreciate the confidence...

309
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,031
...but Dante's never lost a race.

310
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:34,872
He will this time, I guarantee it. I'm gonna
use my heat vision to fry his engine.

311
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,412
I stay away from the kryptonite.
No one gets hurt.

312
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:40,642
A last-minute tune-up.
Clark, you're awesome!

313
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,548
I'm glad you're happy, Pete.

314
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:47,215
Because I had to lie for you and steal
for you, and now I have to cheat for you.

315
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:50,092
Let's get this done.

316
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,229
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Boss.

317
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,629
You got quite a pair of lug nuts
to take me on.

318
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:01,228
Baby, take the Porsche
down to the starting line, okay?

319
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,169
Okay.

320
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,479
How do I know she's not gonna
drive off with it?

321
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,582
I'll drive it down.

322
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,879
Clark, keep an eye on the Mustang.

323
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,828
-We ready to fly?
-Oh, yeah. This kid's for real.

324
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,531
It's not such an easy win.

325
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,837
-Did you put the package in the kid's car?
-Yeah, we're all set.

326
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:45,449
Good. Once the speedometer hits 1 00,
the Boss'll be blown to bits.

327
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:51,422
The race is off. You rigged his car.
There's a bomb in the engine.

328
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:56,088
And who made you racing commissioner?

329
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,492
Put him in the trunk.

330
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,208
-Where's Clark?
-I thought he was out here.

331
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,678
Let's stop stalling. Let's put it down.

332
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,020
Pete.

333
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:34,059
Pete.

334
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,635
Good luck, Boss.

335
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,107
Oh, my God. I think he's dead.

336
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,699
I thought you didn't do house calls.

337
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,328
Thanks to you, the university
is threatening to revoke my tenure.

338
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,737
My funding has been cut off.

339
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,277
I suppose those are the consequences
of conducting illicit drug trials...

340
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:07,077
...without bothering to notify
your own university, let alone the FDA.

341
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,285
You're lucky no federal charges
have been pressed...

342
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,425
...but then again,
that could simply be a matter of time.

343
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:18,028
What exactly is it that you want?

344
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:21,031
I want you to do
what you do best, doctor.

345
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,871
Biology.

346
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:32,306
How do you suggest I do that? The
university won't even let me in the building.

347
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:36,914
I'm gonna fund your research, doctor.
Consider your budget doubled.

348
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,780
You'll have access
to whatever equipment you require...

349
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:46,390
...as long as you tell me where the platelets
come from and what you're using them for.

350
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:33,001
-Adam? Are you there?
-Be right out.

351
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,570
Adam?

352
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,740
Are you okay?

353
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,885
I'm fine.

354
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,547
Adam, I kept my word.

355
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:55,487
I didn't tell anyone about Chad Nash.

356
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:01,496
-But I think I deserve an eXplanation.
-Look, Lana. This is bigger than you realize.

357
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,567
Whatever you know, just forget about it,
for your own good.

358
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:07,067
No, Adam, I can't do that.

359
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:11,004
If you're gonna live here,
you're going to have to be honest with me.

360
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,538
You want the truth?

361
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,711
I'll make it real clear to you.

362
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:25,845
You tell anyone what you found out,
and you're gonna regret ever meeting me.

363
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,216
Clark.

364
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:56,376
-Hey, LeX.
-Hey.

365
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:59,250
I was wondering what ever happened
with your friend.

366
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,119
It turns out the dog's bark
is bigger than his bite.

367
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,618
I had a feeling
you'd work it out, Clark.

368
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:09,825
You know, the oddest thing
happened yesterday.

369
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:16,464
After I talked to you, my silver Porsche
was seen speeding off the grounds.

370
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,669
Someone stole it?

371
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,604
Not eXactly.

372
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:26,412
By the time I got in,
it was resting in my garage...

373
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,211
...snug in its car cover.

374
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,645
That's odd.

375
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:34,882
- I'm glad you got it back.
-Yeah.

376
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:39,393
My security thinks it was a joy rider,
but I'm not so sure.

377
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:45,201
-Why? What do you think happened?
-I don't know.

378
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:49,595
But I understand what it's like
to have a friend in need, Clark.

379
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:53,232
Sometimes you have to cross the moral line
to come to their aid.

380
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:58,240
Often that can be the test
of a true friendship.

381
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,885
Give your dad my regards.

382
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,911
The words "home sweet home"
have never been truer.

383
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,107
-Come on, let's get your feet up.
-I don't need to put my feet up.

384
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:37,186
They've been up for a week. The doctor said
that I need to rest. I'm not an invalid.

385
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,153
Well, I'm gonna make some lunch.
I got you low-sodium turkey.

386
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:43,657
-Low-sodium turkey?
-Jonathan.

387
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,961
Sounds good, sweetheart.

388
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,799
Clark, sit down.

389
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,399
Listen, son.
It doesn't take a genius to realize...

390
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:59,270
...that something's been bothering you
other than my health lately. What's up?

391
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,472
While you were in the hospital,
Pete got himself into a bind.

392
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:10,085
I did some things
I'm not too proud of.

393
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,585
Well, your mother and l
trust your judgment.

394
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:17,990
We did raise you to know the difference
between right and wrong.

395
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:22,532
One day when we're not around anymore,
I'm sure that you're gonna remember it.

396
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:29,531
Look, in the world,
things aren't always black and white.

397
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,107
Sometimes you gotta wander out
into the gray areas...

398
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,710
... and do what you think is best.

399
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,440
What do you mean?

400
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,953
Clark, I did go talk to Jor-El.

401
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,420
And I think maybe
that is why my heart gave out.

402
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:49,786
But listen, son...

403
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:53,791
...I went into that cave knowing full well
that there were risks involved.

404
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:56,091
I'd do it again if thought
you were in trouble.

405
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:59,202
Dad, I promise I'll never put you
in that position again.

406
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,464
Clark, that's not what this is about.

407
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,068
You're different than
your mother and l.

408
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:10,637
Son, you're gonna have to make
choices in your life, moral choices...

409
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,113
...that she and I'll never
have to make.

410
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:18,247
But we both know,
that when that time comes...

411
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:22,256
...you'll do what you think is best.

412
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,417
What's right.

413
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,622
That's what's important.

414
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,545
-Hey.
-Hey.

415
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,382
Clark, look, l....

416
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,094
I know you're probably mad as hell at me,
and to be honest, I don't blame you.

417
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,655
All I can say is I'm sorry.

418
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,663
I am too, Pete.

419
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:10,238
I had to steal from one friend
to help another...

420
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:11,936
...and someone died.

421
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:15,738
I know.

422
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:20,973
If I had listened to you from the start,
none of this would've happened.

423
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:26,587
Clark, listen, you told me your secret
because I'm your friend...

424
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,556
...and at times,
that's not an easy thing to be.

425
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,597
But it doesn't give me the right
to do what I did.

426
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:36,226
I just wanna say that--

427
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:40,702
Clark, I swear,
it will never happen again.

428
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,838
Clark, I know I let you down.

429
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,810
But I promise you
until the day that I die...

430
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:54,280
...I will never disrespect
your powers again.

431
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,824
You wanna play some hoops?

432
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:10,996
-I was just about to go inside.
-Come on. Game of 21 by twos.

433
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:14,194
Three-pointers outside of the crack.
No powers.

434
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,043
Not today, Pete.

435
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
