1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,957
I think that's him.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,792
Okay, let's go.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,154
Move it back, please!

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,270
Clark, pick up the pace, somewhere
between brisk walk and super-speed.

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,476
The star witness
testifies in 15 minutes.

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,671
Not that I mind being
your boy Friday...

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,195
<i>...but</i> I don't understand
why you need an escort.

8
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,591
I don't. I just thought
a nice little courthouse field trip...

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,713
...might reignite the journalism spark.
- Well, I hate to break it to you...

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,758
...but my ace reporter days ended
when I left <i>the Torch.</i>

11
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,071
All right, then consider it a much needed
get off the farm pass.

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,915
Clark, this has been the year from hell.
That was before you broke up with Lana.

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,674
There are only so many days
you can hole yourself up...

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,276
...before I pull an intervention.
- Wait, I am not holed up.

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,551
It's just, ever since I found <i>out...</i>

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,110
...that Lionel knows my secret,
I've been waiting for a bomb to go off.

17
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,000
Don't duck and cover yet.
I mean, for all we know...

18
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,798
...he may never even light the fuse.

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,871
This is Lionel Luthor
we're talking about.

20
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,597
You okay?

21
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,234
You...

22
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,714
You saved my life.

23
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,750
- I don't know how to thank you.
- I did what anybody else would have.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,912
I'm sorry, I have to go.
Thank you again, really.

25
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,119
Hey.

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,350
Now, you couldn't
do that on the farm.

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,636
Thanks to you,
that guy's got a lease on life.

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,199
Nice work.

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,799
Careful.

30
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,792
Holding room checks out.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,514
- Witness has arrived safe and secure.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

32
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,116
There's only one way into this room.
We're guarding it. Get your stuff on.

33
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,716
Can I help you with that?

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,150
All right, we're calling security.

35
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,231
Man down.

36
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,159
Man down, secure the area.

37
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,118
- Man down, secure the area.
- He's not breathing.

38
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,596
Call an ambulance.

39
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,358
<i>Give it up.</i>

40
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,556
Die samurai, die.

41
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,278
Anyone want a piece of this?

42
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,752
Take that.

43
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,918
Lois.

44
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,430
Too late, sucka!
Yojimbo, you are mine.

45
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,153
Lois.

46
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,472
Aw, come on, Smallville,
you killed me.

47
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,790
- Where did all this come from?
- Good question.

48
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,316
I think there's a card somewhere.

49
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,429
Looks like Christmas came early this
year, in Hi-Def surround sound, no less.

50
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,632
The delivery guys were unloading it.

51
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,112
- You win a raffle or something?
- Not that I know of.

52
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,470
There you go. "clark."

53
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,751
- And I'll just get to work.
- Who's it from?

54
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,794
I don't need a signature.
This is from Lionel Luthor.

55
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,916
Clark, I wouldn't jump
to conclusions.

56
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,798
I warned him to
stay out of our lives.

57
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,953
- This is his way to buy himself back in.
- I really don't think Lionel would do <i>this...</i>

58
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,076
<i>...but</i> I'll go call and find out.

59
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,951
Clark, do you remember that trial...

60
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,190
...that was cancelled due
to circumstances?

61
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,636
The star witness was murdered
in the basement of the courthouse.

62
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,597
The basement? Are there any leads?

63
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,228
Nothing. And now
the prosecution has no case.

64
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,914
Looks like this story has gone
from legal to lethal.

65
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,230
I guess this is a bad time
to ask for a favor.

66
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,630
You kidding? The times
you've saved my <i>butt...</i>

67
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,678
...you can pull a coin from
the favor bank any time. What's up?

68
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,274
Someone sent me a 50-inch plasma
with all the bells...

69
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,078
...forgot to sign the gift card.

70
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,277
Clark, that's not a problem.
That's winning the trifecta.

71
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,959
- When's movie night?
- Never.

72
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,680
- I sent it all back.
- No, you didn't.

73
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,394
Yes, I did. I'm not gonna
accept a gift like that...

74
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,272
<i>...when</i> I don't know who it's from.

75
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,358
I called Metro Plasma.
They won't give me any information.

76
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,909
- Can you call them, get in their records?
- Sure.

77
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,748
It sounds like a move
straight from Lionel Luthor.

78
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,431
That's the thing that I thought. My mom
called. He had nothing to do with it.

79
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,108
It looks like your secret
Santa remains anonymous.

80
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,634
He paid in cash. If not Lionel,
what about Luthor Jr?

81
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,713
Lex? Why would he
send me a home theater system?

82
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,519
Maybe he's feeling guilty.

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,433
Guilty about what?

84
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,831
I don't know. I mean he hasn't exactly
been the best friend lately.

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,709
So he also has been known to try
and win you over with expensive toys.

86
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,918
He did say he wanted
to try to find some common ground.

87
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,836
I'm gonna go talk to him.

88
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,998
What's the deal, senator?
Do you not like kids?

89
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,674
Because a no-vote
on Senator Kent's bill is <i>like...</i>

90
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,308
...ripping the textbooks
out of their sticky fingers.

91
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,432
Thank you, senator.

92
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,992
Bye, now.

93
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,878
Yes.

94
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,836
Official warning:
I'm a third-degree black belt.

95
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,434
That means I can't be liable
for any funeral costs.

96
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,473
Go easy on me.
I'm a friend of clark's.

97
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,113
Are you his girlfriend?

98
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,032
Not in this lifetime.

99
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,276
I'm Lois. Lois Lane.

100
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,870
Pleasure to meet you, Lois.

101
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,468
- I'm Graham.
- Hey.

102
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,516
So where's the plasma?

103
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,598
So you're the one who sent over
all the high-tech booty.

104
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,116
You know, I was gonna keep it.
Mr. <i>L-can't-take-candy-from-strangers...</i>

105
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,510
...took every thing back this morning.

106
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,913
- That's odd.
- That's clark Kent.

107
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,274
Can I ask why you're playing
Daddy Warbucks with the guy?

108
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,318
Because in my world, friends
don't give friends $20,000 toys.

109
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,278
In my world they do.

110
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,830
- Is Clark around?
- No, not at the moment.

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,595
Of course, he never stays
gone for too long, so...

112
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,228
If you wanna hang out,
you're more than welcome.

113
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,918
I think I will.

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,434
I see you stepped up your security.

115
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,872
I had to make a pretty good case
before they'd let me in.

116
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,878
You're not an easy person
to say no to.

117
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,278
I couldn't wait any longer.

118
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,919
I've been sitting by the phone.

119
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,276
What'd you find out in D. C?

120
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,193
A lot of plausible deniability.

121
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,157
From the Pentagon
to the White House...

122
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,676
...no one can verify
the existence of Milton Fine.

123
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,077
He works in a branch
of the government.

124
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,117
Maybe it's more covert than we think.

125
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,117
If he even works there at all.

126
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,835
Those classified documents
he gave you, you think they're a forgery?

127
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,629
No, I had them authenticated,
but that doesn't mean anything.

128
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,348
We have no idea
who this guy really is.

129
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,317
No. No.

130
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,358
Don't worry. I'll find out.

131
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,754
You know, I was only gone
for a week...

132
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,311
...but I actually got a little homesick.

133
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,712
What's so special about Smallville?

134
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,311
Oh, I don't know.

135
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,553
Cows.

136
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,269
Cornfields. Wide open spaces.

137
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,591
I missed you too.

138
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,395
You have no idea.

139
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,315
Hey.

140
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,711
Riddle me this:
How does an assassin...

141
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,189
...get in a completely
sealed room unseen.

142
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,799
You knew, didn't you?

143
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,872
No, that's why it's a riddle.

144
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,877
I asked you how Lana was doing...

145
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,634
...and you avoided
the subject like the plague.

146
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,469
You knew about her and Lex.

147
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,190
I'm sorry, clark.

148
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,874
But I didn't think
it was my place to get involved.

149
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,832
You're supposed to be my friend.

150
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,351
- I am your friend.
- You are?

151
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,239
- Then why didn't you say anything?
- I'm Lana's friend too.

152
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,197
And she asked me
to keep it a secret.

153
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,237
I thought you of all people
would respect that.

154
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,153
You know how dangerous Lex is.
Any friend of <i>Lana's...</i>

155
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,392
...would never let her get involved.
- I wasn't jumping for joy.

156
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,229
But Lana's a big girl.
Where are you going?

157
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,197
Clark, where are you going?

158
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,794
Lana has no idea
what she's getting herself into.

159
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,877
Let me remind you that you broke up.

160
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,112
That means Lana can date whoever
she wants without your permission.

161
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,311
I know. But I still care about her.

162
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,199
And I don't wanna just stand by
and watch her get hurt.

163
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,468
Look, I hate to be the one to say this,
but you don't have a choice.

164
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,756
Let me guess...

165
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,189
...bad breakup?
I've had a few of those.

166
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,231
You're the guy from the courthouse.

167
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,793
You're a tough man to please.

168
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,030
What's the problem,
you don't watch Tv?

169
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,672
- Wait, you sent that?
- You saved my life.

170
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,038
If it wasn't for you, I'd be in a morgue
with tire tracks across my forehead.

171
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,156
It's the least I can do.

172
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,150
How did you find me?
I never told you my name.

173
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,436
That press pass around your neck did.

174
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,398
The fact that I'm familiar
with the area led me straight here.

175
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,072
- Oh, you're from Smallville.
- Drove through last year on business.

176
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,073
Clark, if the big screen's
not your thing, what is?

177
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,079
Help me out here. There must
be something I can do for you.

178
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,637
Your thank you is fine.
I appreciate the gesture.

179
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,711
You don't need to repay me.

180
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,992
This isn't about you, clark.

181
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,559
It's about me.

182
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,234
I don't ever like to be in debt.
And the fact is...

183
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,231
...I owe you my life.

184
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,954
Let me buy you dinner.

185
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,153
- I'm staying in Metropolis. I'll take you.
- Thanks, but really, I'm okay.

186
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,432
You're hanging out in a barn <i>alone...</i>

187
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,556
...in the middle of nowhere.

188
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,035
That doesn't seem too okay to me.

189
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,114
Hey, come on, over here.

190
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,835
Looks like the chicken
finally flew the coop.

191
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,672
Getting worried about you, man.

192
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,434
We were going to dinner.
What's going on with the party?

193
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,113
Made a killing the other day...

194
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,191
<i>...and</i> it's all thanks to clark Kent.

195
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,716
- You thirsty? How about a Mojito?
- No, thanks, I'm good.

196
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,996
- What exactly do you do?
- I'm a headhunter.

197
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,311
I travel the world tracking
people down, you know, for jobs.

198
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,311
I'd like you to meet my date.

199
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,355
Hey, good for you.

200
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,112
Lois.

201
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,790
- Smallville.
- We met out at your house.

202
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,114
I couldn't disappear
without seeing her again.

203
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,911
Lois, can I talk to you for a second?

204
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,475
- How about later?
- It's fine.

205
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,352
I'll be right back.

206
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,030
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing? Lois.

207
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,515
Look, Clark, I happen
to actually like this guy.

208
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,830
So do me one favor and
pretend not to know me.

209
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,274
- Lois...
- No.

210
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,871
Hey, pal, you gotta check out
the view from the balcony.

211
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,916
You know, I'm not crazy
about heights.

212
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,548
Trust me. It's worth it.

213
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,677
Oh, good, I can make it.

214
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,229
It's gotten pretty big right now.

215
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,911
Beautiful night, huh?

216
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,959
Yeah, it is.

217
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,912
I'm Gia.

218
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,436
Hi, Gia.

219
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,717
- I'm clark.
- I know.

220
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,191
Guy like you...

221
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,430
You must have a girlfriend, huh?

222
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,674
Me? I...

223
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,629
...don't.

224
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,631
Do you wanna take a tour?

225
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,073
I hear the view from the bedroom
is even better than the balcony.

226
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,712
What's wrong?

227
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,077
I don't even know you.

228
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,191
That's okay.

229
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,518
Graham warned me you might be shy.

230
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,392
Graham?

231
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,518
He wants you to have a good time.

232
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,513
I'm sorry, I think
there's a misunderstanding.

233
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,878
I should go.

234
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,835
Whoa, whoa, what happened?
Where are you going?

235
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,471
Look, if you wanna do me a favor,
consider us even. I gotta go.

236
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,119
Look, Clark, I apologize.

237
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,272
I thought Gia was just what
the doctor ordered. But I was wrong.

238
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,908
You're a lot deeper
than I gave you credit for.

239
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,310
You must have really loved your ex.

240
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,594
What's the problem?
Let's get you two back together.

241
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,951
- It's a little late for that.
- It's never too late.

242
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,469
It is when she's already
with someone else.

243
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,069
That might make it difficult
but not impossible.

244
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,232
- Who's the lucky bastard?
- Someone I used to call my friend.

245
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,155
That's not crossing the line.

246
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,359
That's just plain wrong.

247
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,791
Yeah, well, if you knew Lex Luthor
you wouldn't be surprised.

248
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,757
That billionaire might be with her now.
But don't lose faith, clark.

249
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,032
If it's meant to be, things have
a way of working themselves out.

250
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,874
- Well, I hope you're right.
- I know I am.

251
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,111
I'm always right.

252
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,115
Rest assured, Fine, we're close.

253
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,716
Viruses are being genetically
spliced as we speak.

254
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,551
Lex!

255
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,391
Help! Help, please!

256
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,916
Call an ambulance. Hurry.

257
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,155
Lex...

258
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,390
<i>...it's</i> gonna be okay.

259
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,919
Chloe called me.
She told me what happened.

260
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,432
How's he doing?

261
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,396
Luckily, his trachea didn't collapse.

262
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,869
And the doctor sedated him
for the pain.

263
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,309
- Where's Lionel?
- Lionel's on his way from Singapore.

264
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,231
You're a good friend
for staying here with him like this.

265
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,353
Someone should be with him
when he wakes up.

266
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,073
Yeah...

267
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,878
...of course.

268
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,633
Do they know who did this?

269
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,435
I gave them a full description.

270
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,198
You were there when it happened?

271
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,114
I was returning some books
and I walked in on the attack.

272
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,233
What does the guy look like?

273
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,958
Dark hair, dark eyes.

274
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,476
About six feet tall.
Was wearing a black trench coat.

275
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,195
Clark, he seemed
to vanish into thin air.

276
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,358
Quite a sweet tooth
you got there.

277
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,076
My dentist would agree.

278
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,434
- I thought you were heading out.
- I was.

279
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,876
But I couldn't get a certain
someone out of my mind...

280
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,828
...someone with a beautiful smile
and apparently a lot of cavities.

281
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,513
Look, if you think I'm blushing,
I'm just a little sunburned.

282
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,433
Well, if you're not too busy
applying the aloe vera...

283
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,397
...you wanna go
see Coldplay with me?

284
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,917
Tonight? Wow, they're
playing in Metropolis?

285
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,953
Actually, Chicago. I chartered a jet.

286
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,156
We'll have dinner on it.
You like Italian?

287
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,189
Graham, if you wanna go out, you
don't have to play the jet-setter card.

288
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,319
It's not a card.

289
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,754
It's a reality.

290
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,388
I work for large corporations
that take care of me.

291
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,198
I should think about getting a job...

292
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,590
...in the whole corporate
headhunting business.

293
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,830
- Sounds like a load of fun.
- It is.

294
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,554
But it can get a little cutthroat.

295
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,438
So, what do you say?

296
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,236
Look, I love jetting off to Coldplay
concerts like the next girl, but really...

297
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,075
<i>...I'm</i> just as happy going down to Jo's
for some Foggybottom burgers.

298
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,878
Then I'll tell you what.

299
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,595
We'll have Foggybottom burgers
on the plane.

300
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,273
Pick you up at 6?

301
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,353
I'll be wearing
my glass slippers.

302
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,830
Afraid the party's over.

303
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,477
Clark, you know Lois well.
Is she a candy or flowers kind of girl?

304
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,517
You tried to kill Lex.

305
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,278
Me? Why would I do that?

306
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,278
You have some sick idea
you'd be doing me a favor.

307
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,993
Well...

308
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,038
...you do have to admit...

309
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,232
...if Lex was out of the picture
and Lana was as free as a bird...

310
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,312
I'm taking you to the police.

311
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,993
I guess I'm not the only one
who's got a little secret.

312
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,757
If your meteor-challenged friend
tried to kill Lex to repay a favor...

313
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,275
<i>...it's</i> not the first time
he's murdered someone.

314
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,237
In fact, he might even be
the Chameleon.

315
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,994
Who's the chameleon?

316
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,194
Hitman for hire.
Number eight on the FBI's Top <i>40...</i>

317
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,396
...and climbing the charts.

318
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,593
He's also the prime suspect
for the courthouse murder.

319
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,239
Which was after I saved Graham.

320
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,991
His trademark
is getting to his victims...

321
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,593
...in highly secure locations.

322
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,034
He leaves no prints...

323
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,915
...no images on surveillance cameras,
and no clues.

324
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,072
Meteor power would explain it.
He said he'd been in Smallville.

325
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,753
Well, unfortunately, there's no record of
camouflage power on the Wall of Weird.

326
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,115
And the name Graham Garrett
didn't get any hits.

327
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,952
This guy's totally off the grid.

328
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,709
If I hadn't saved him,
that witness would be alive...

329
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,950
<i>...and</i> Lex wouldn't be
in the hospital.

330
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,509
- I gotta stop him.
- Well, it's easier said than done.

331
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,478
When you're a wanted man,
invisibility really comes in handy.

332
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,758
Every law enforcement agency
has been after him for the last year.

333
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,712
I'm no typical
law enforcement agency.

334
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,677
Clark, don't get too cocky.

335
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,953
Not only does this guy know your power,
he could very well know your weakness.

336
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,111
How would he know
about the meteor rocks?

337
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,396
Clark, he's the ultimate
fly on the wall.

338
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,114
And he's buzzing over to the Talon
later on tonight...

339
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,679
...for his date with Lois.

340
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,313
I gotta call and warn her.

341
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,519
Hello?

342
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,516
What are you doing here?

343
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,875
Lois, I've been calling,
knocking on the door.

344
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,759
- How long have you been in there?
- About an hour and a half.

345
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,876
- What?
- Hey.

346
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,718
You weren't in my bathroom,
were you?

347
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,472
I just walked in the apartment.

348
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,514
That's weird. I could've sworn
someone was in there.

349
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,309
- Graham.
- You're blaming Graham? It's pathetic.

350
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,074
- Lf you see him, stay away.
- Why do you feel the need...

351
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,071
...to lob a grenade at every guy I date?

352
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,753
Quiet.

353
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,873
He's here.

354
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,875
Amazing what you can learn
as a fly on the wall.

355
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,471
These meteors that fell from the sky
the day I drove through town...

356
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,874
...they might hurt you...

357
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,079
...but they gave me the greatest life
I could ever ask for.

358
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,396
You were in Smallville
the day of the shower?

359
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,511
Luckiest day of my life.

360
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,870
Think using your power
to be a hero's a rush?

361
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,913
Nothing beats using them to kill.

362
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,758
I saved your life.

363
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,038
You should have taken the plasma.

364
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,108
Now that my identity's in jeopardy,
I have no choice.

365
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,830
I have to get rid of you, Lex
and Lana.

366
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,918
- No.
- They saw who I was, Clark.

367
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,317
In my work,
you don't leave loose ends.

368
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,232
You'll never get away with it.

369
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,873
I always do.

370
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,559
Hey.

371
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,711
You're not supposed to talk.

372
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,435
I'm not supposed to
do a lot of things.

373
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,832
Did they catch the guy?

374
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,513
No, not yet.

375
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,631
But they're going to.

376
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,829
Lex, I don't understand
who would want to do this.

377
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,758
Pick a number.

378
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,750
There are a lot of people who want
to see me breathe my last breath.

379
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,994
But I'm not going to
make it easy for them.

380
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,709
I have too much to live for.

381
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,039
Thanks for being here.

382
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,478
As you can see, there's not exactly
a... crowd of well wishers...

383
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,949
...knocking down the door
to be at my bedside.

384
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,510
Actually, I wasn't your only visitor.

385
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,951
Clark stopped by earlier.

386
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,194
Really?

387
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,839
Yeah.

388
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,028
It's too bad it takes
a near-death experience...

389
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,838
...to bring old friends together.

390
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,591
Did you tell him about us?

391
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,316
I don't owe clark anything, Lex.

392
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,072
Especially the truth.

393
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,635
I know you're angry at him.

394
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,072
- But he deserves a modicum of respect.
- This isn't about anger.

395
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,953
I'll tell him when I'm ready,
on my own terms.

396
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,997
Lana, don't let him find <i>out...</i>

397
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,116
...from someone else first.

398
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,030
Lois! Hey. Where's clark?

399
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,879
No clue. He just busted in here,
warned me about Graham...

400
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,598
...and took off.
- Any idea where?

401
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,392
I wasn't exactly paying attention.

402
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,120
To be honest,
I am starting to get a little tired...

403
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,432
...of him thinking I need his approval
just to go on a simple date.

404
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,160
Can you tell me why he's obsessed
with my love life?

405
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,759
Lois...

406
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,558
...Graham's a killer.

407
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,035
A professional hitman.

408
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,230
- Of course he is.
- We need to find Clark.

409
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,554
Clark! Clark!

410
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,915
Waitress said he ran out back.
He can't be far.

411
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,838
You'd be surprised.

412
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,756
Hey, Smallville!

413
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,712
Clark?

414
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,311
- Clark?
- Clark?

415
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,033
- Smallville!
- Oh, my God.

416
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,719
Oh, my God.

417
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,438
Oh, God. Jesus.

418
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,909
Oh, my... Clark! Clark!

419
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,873
Damn it.

420
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,313
Come on, Clark.

421
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,353
- Hey, are you okay?
- Wake up.

422
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,073
Clark, wake up.

423
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,158
He's going after Lex and Lana.

424
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,479
Is everything okay?

425
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,439
Yeah.

426
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,273
I just thought
you were somebody else.

427
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,152
It's just <i>me...</i>

428
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,515
...bringing you a little comfort.

429
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,677
I thought you'd prefer these
to the uncomfortable hospital garb.

430
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,118
They're perfect.

431
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,192
- Lex?
- Lana...

432
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,316
- What's happening?
...get behind me.

433
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,632
Lana, run. Run! Go!

434
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,951
You saved my life.

435
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,075
- Good morning, senator.
- Hi.

436
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,998
Good news.

437
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,277
- You have Senator Wickman's vote.
- That's great, Lois.

438
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,160
So how are you?
Clark told me what happened.

439
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,194
Me? I'm fine.

440
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,588
Getting swept off my feet
by a notorious hitman...

441
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,320
...is just my way of living
<i>la vida loca.</i>

442
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,119
There's no way you could have
known the truth about him.

443
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,875
Maybe. But it does confirm
a very disturbing trend in my life.

444
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,429
And as much as I'd like to deny <i>it...</i>

445
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,717
...I seem to be a magnet for guys
on <i>America 's Most Wanted.</i>

446
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,115
Oh, I don't believe that.

447
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,999
Trust me, you don't wanna
see the rap sheets.

448
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,788
Why can't I meet a decent guy
from a decent family...

449
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,474
...who happens not to be
a psychopath?

450
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,957
Oh, Lois.

451
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,154
You know...

452
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,679
...when I was your age...

453
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,673
<i>...I</i> wasn't dating
Prince Charmings either.

454
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

455
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,038
I used to attract the dark,
mysterious type too.

456
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,679
Until I met Jonathan.

457
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,111
See, what worries me is that...

458
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,238
...when my Jonathan finally does
come around...

459
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,233
<i>...I'll</i> be looking the other way
and I'll miss him completely.

460
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,719
Well, you have to keep
a closer watch.

461
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,115
You know, I think we go through
these bad relationships for a reason.

462
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,114
Well, if there's a good reason for all the
pain and aggravation, I'm dying to know.

463
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,272
Maybe you have to get through
all the wrong men...

464
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,000
...so you can recognize the right one.

465
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,754
Congratulations on your
first front-page byline.

466
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,837
Yeah, and you deserve all the credit.

467
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,513
Or the blame.

468
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,195
If saving strangers gets people killed,
it's not the business I wanna be in.

469
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,510
Do you have a choice?
I'm nowhere near <i>super...</i>

470
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,069
...but if I see someone drowning,
I'll throw a rope.

471
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,629
And what if that person's
a killer, Chloe?

472
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,916
What if the world would actually
be better off?

473
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,794
That's still...
That's not your choice to make.

474
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,554
I mean, ask a doctor,
or a firefighter...

475
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,312
...or anyone in the hero business.

476
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,835
You save first
and you ask questions later.

477
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,600
Yeah. I guess you're right.

478
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,911
It's just not always that easy.

479
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,637
Especially when the person you're saving
is Lex Luthor.

480
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,676
I should never have questioned
your friendship.

481
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,434
You were angry. And I understand.

482
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,832
It's not a walk in the park to see the one
you love in the arms of someone else.

483
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,274
Of all the people in the world,
why Lex?

484
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,558
Just like you can't pick and choose
the people you save...

485
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,076
<i>...you</i> can't control who your
ex-girlfriend dates. That's the way it is.

486
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,674
You have no idea how hard it was
to see them like that.

487
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,831
It's like I couldn't breathe.

488
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,274
I'm sorry you had to
find out that way.

489
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,874
I know how much it must have hurt.

490
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,590
But you know, Lana's moved on.

491
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,312
Maybe it's time you started
doing the same thing.

492
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,357
I thought you loved that telescope.

493
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,438
I did.

494
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,556
Doesn't work anymore.

495
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,234
Lex got out of the hospital today.

496
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,992
Well, that's great.

497
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,552
He's a lucky guy.

498
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,075
Clark, when
you and I were together...

499
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,596
...nothing bothered me more than when
you were less than honest with me.

500
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,716
And I don't wanna be like that.

501
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,593
That's a good choice.

502
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,358
At the hospital...

503
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,273
...when I told you I was at the mansion
to return books...

504
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,112
...I was lying.

505
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,713
Lex and I have actually been
spending a lot of time together.

506
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,470
You know, I kind of noticed.

507
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,551
Clark, it's more than that.

508
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,074
We're seeing each other.

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,470
And I thought that it would be best
if you heard it from me first.

510
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,029
Lana, I know
you don't wanna hear <i>this...</i>

511
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,874
...especially from me.

512
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,713
- You can't trust Lex.
- And I could trust you?

513
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,675
I just don't wanna see you get hurt.

514
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,949
I know you think you're being
some kind of a hero, Clark...

515
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,311
...but the truth is...

516
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,713
<i>...I</i> don't need you to protect me.

517
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,353
Lana.

518
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,519
Clark...

519
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,559
<i>...it's</i> over.

520
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,116
You made that decision.
