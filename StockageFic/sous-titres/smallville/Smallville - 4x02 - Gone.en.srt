1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,981
Previously in Smallville

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,175
- Who are you?
- Lois Lane.

3
00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:09,848
I think we're going to enjoy
a long and fructuous partnership, Ms. Sullivan

4
00:00:09,863 --> 00:00:12,465
I need your help, about your grandfather's dispareance

5
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:13,434
There is no prouve.

6
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:16,295
Only the voice mail confession of Lionel Luthor himself.

7
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,922
- I'm leaving.
- Paris?

8
00:00:18,073 --> 00:00:20,211
Lionel Luthor, you're
under arrest for murder.

9
00:00:20,236 --> 00:00:21,987
Clark Kent is dead.

10
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:31,315
I don't believe that safe house's
explosion was an accident.

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,890
She dead as a result of her own actions,
I am nothing to do with it.

12
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:37,990
I promise I will find who did this to you.

13
00:00:38,013 --> 00:00:39,387
You're not the only one who miss her.

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,355
Just me the anyone doing something about it.

15
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:43,980
Lois? Chloe still alive.

16
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:49,799
I know you find it hard to believe,
but trust me,

17
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:51,665
Chloe's not buried in that grave.

18
00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:53,625
How do you know that?

19
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:58,203
Look, I want her back more than anyone, but don't you
think your hunch is a rungon the whole grief ladder?

20
00:00:58,218 --> 00:01:00,352
None of this would've happened
if I had been there.

21
00:01:00,584 --> 00:01:05,736
Okay, commando,I don't get you. Half the time
you're all meek and "yes, ma," "yes, pa. "

22
00:01:05,778 --> 00:01:09,503
And the other half, you are the most
over confident guy I've ever met.

23
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:13,455
It doesn't happen to you much, does it...
not being able to peg someone right away?

24
00:01:14,517 --> 00:01:17,832
Oh, get over yourself.
You are not that complicated.

25
00:01:18,726 --> 00:01:20,492
This is Chloe's safe house?

26
00:01:20,717 --> 00:01:22,253
You mean, what's left of it?

27
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,314
Oh, my god. Chloe...

28
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:31,221
what did they do to you?

29
00:01:36,419 --> 00:01:39,147
What exactly do you expect to find here?

30
00:01:39,288 --> 00:01:41,640
I don't know, but the fbi sealed the case,

31
00:01:41,743 --> 00:01:43,577
even the autopsy reports.

32
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:46,614
Doesn't that sound a little odd?

33
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:50,760
Remind me if I'm ever a witness,

34
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,142
not to put my life in the hands of the fbi.

35
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:57,238
Well, maybe she got out before the explosion.

36
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:00,974
They said she walked inside, clark.

37
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:03,903
I don't know how anyone could survive this.

38
00:02:05,357 --> 00:02:09,747
Look, you can have your head in the sand and believe
she's alive, but I'm gonna find out who did this to her.

39
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:16,956
Let's get outta here,clark.
This place gives me the creeps.

40
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:35,651
Run!

41
00:03:55,498 --> 00:03:56,364
Lois!

42
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:01,197
Well, don't just stand there.
Come on.

43
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:15,430
We lost them.
-Find them!

44
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,369
Yes, Sir.

49
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,097
Nothing like a little north by northwest
action to get the blood pumping, huh?

50
00:05:33,742 --> 00:05:34,987
Um...

51
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,670
we usually take turns in the bathroom.

52
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,753
Oh, don't start with me, smallville.

53
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:41,945
You're the one taking the marathon shower.

54
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:44,454
Besides, my delicate feminine sensibilities

55
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:47,029
weren't offended the first time
I got a glimpse of, uh,

56
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:48,937
Clark junior.

57
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:53,395
My parents kinda missed
the whole woodstock phase.

58
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:56,712
Besides, they freaked out the last
time they caught me in a...

59
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:58,415
co-ed situation.

60
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:00,162
Last time?

61
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:04,419
So the eagle scout does have
a few secrets in the closet.

62
00:06:06,923 --> 00:06:08,800
Just forget it, all right?

63
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:11,293
That's my shirt.

64
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,840
It's the only thing I could find that was clean.

65
00:06:15,413 --> 00:06:20,424
Hey... let's keep this morning's game
of chopper tag... a secret, okay?

66
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,661
Right.

67
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:25,315
Because I'm the one who can't keep my mouth shut.

68
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,691
Mom.

69
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,738
Hi.

70
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:30,136
You're home.

71
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:34,341
Hi, mrs. Kent.

72
00:07:30,097 --> 00:07:33,228
I don't understand what the big deal
is here. We just took a shower.

73
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:35,469
Showers. We took separate showers.

74
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:36,838
At noon?

75
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,948
- We were just gonna...
- We went to chloe's safe house.

76
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:49,357
These guys showed up and chased us
into a field, and there was all this dirt.

77
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,537
Clark,

78
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,680
that is a federal crime scene.

79
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,453
And the last thing that we want is for you
two kids to get involved with the fbi.

80
00:07:59,497 --> 00:08:04,445
Whoever it was, we don't need to worry, because
their chopper is face-first in the middle of the field.

81
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:16,934
Your non-verbals are killing me, and

82
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:19,743
this seems like it's a family matter, so...

83
00:08:20,387 --> 00:08:22,322
I'm just gonna get outta the way.

84
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,185
Way to go.

85
00:08:33,802 --> 00:08:38,619
Please tell me that you did
not crash that helicopter.

86
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:49,511
Waste of a new suit, isn't it, dad?

87
00:08:49,672 --> 00:08:51,889
Well, I don't think so, son.

88
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:55,994
Even if miss Sullivan were alive
and testified against me,

89
00:08:56,043 --> 00:09:00,205
you and I both know the jury
would still find me not guilty.

90
00:09:02,404 --> 00:09:04,528
But I am sorry, Lex.

91
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:08,750
Sorry that you killed a bright young woman
just because she stood in your way?

92
00:09:08,794 --> 00:09:11,384
My apology concerns you and me.

93
00:09:11,428 --> 00:09:12,432
I'm...

94
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:17,467
sorry that you couldn't foresee the consequences
of your actions when you betrayed me.

95
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:22,304
You can save the threats, dad. I'm not
as easy a target as you seem to think.

96
00:09:25,236 --> 00:09:27,026
All those tests...

97
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,097
all those trials that made you strong.

98
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:34,599
But this time, it's different.

99
00:09:35,254 --> 00:09:40,144
You'll never know when
it will happen, but it will happen.

100
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:44,436
Each swallow of wine you take,

101
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:47,885
every key you turn, every...

102
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:51,581
friend you make...

103
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,129
you'll never have another moment's peace.

104
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,349
You look great.

105
00:10:29,393 --> 00:10:31,066
Thank you.

106
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:32,741
- Hey.
- Hey.

107
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:41,277
So, from your message, I didn't quite get
that this is a stopover or if you're back for good.

108
00:10:41,322 --> 00:10:43,039
For a while.

109
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,426
I guess paris just wasn't for me.

110
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,789
Yeah.

111
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:49,958
Museums,

112
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:54,745
late night jazz clubs, walks along the seine...
I can see how that can all get boring.

113
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,197
Let's just say that

114
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:00,413
I felt as though something was calling me home.

115
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:03,091
A little cryptic, but I'll take it.

116
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:06,223
Well, you picked a good day for home coming.

117
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,788
You know, Clark just resurfaced, too.

118
00:11:10,065 --> 00:11:11,680
Interesting timing.

119
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:14,678
Funny. I don't remember asking about clark.

120
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:19,744
Actually, um, I came by because
I saw the talon was boarded up.

121
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:21,446
I thought you would've sold it by now.

122
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:22,995
Yeah, well,

123
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,630
I had a little trouble letting it go.

124
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:30,244
Why, are you in the market for a partner?

125
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:32,180
No.

126
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,233
Um...

127
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,581
no, I want to rent the apartment.

128
00:12:33,852 --> 00:12:37,898
I hope that Clark is right. Otherwise,
this is gonna be really ugly, Chloé.

129
00:12:42,517 --> 00:12:43,405
Okay.

130
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,822
He was right.

131
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:29,600
Where's Chloe Sullivan?

132
00:13:29,906 --> 00:13:33,297
- Who the hell are you?
- You'd better tell me where she is.

133
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:43,258
What...

134
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:47,514
the posse couldn't get to me
the first time, so the boss sent you?

135
00:13:48,256 --> 00:13:50,380
You can both kiss my ass.

136
00:14:12,974 --> 00:14:14,444
Are you okay?

137
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:23,031
Where the hell did he go?

138
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:27,809
Medieval psychopath.

139
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:32,320
Guess you'd have to be in order to dig up
a gravein the middle of the day.

140
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,547
Actually... that was me.

141
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:39,812
It's my cousin's grave.

142
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:43,654
Lois lane.

143
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:49,480
Lana Lang.

144
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:12,961
Lana.

145
00:15:13,898 --> 00:15:15,106
You're back.

146
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:17,022
Hi. Hi, Clark.

147
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,675
Lois.

148
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:24,906
How did you two..?

149
00:15:25,285 --> 00:15:26,726
We just met.

150
00:15:26,784 --> 00:15:29,941
I stopped by the cemetery
to pay my respects to Chloe.

151
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:32,998
I think you're forgetting about
the part where you saved my life.

152
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:36,924
Some ginsu boy came after usat Chloe's grave.

153
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:42,279
Look, Clark, if you really think that
Chloe's alive, I... I want to help find her.

154
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:44,362
Uh, Lana...

155
00:15:44,872 --> 00:15:48,218
look, I don't want to get your hopes up,
but we don't know anything for sure.

156
00:15:49,893 --> 00:15:51,130
Okay.

157
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:56,545
You're back from Paris. You must've
found what you were looking for.

158
00:15:56,574 --> 00:15:57,869
I'll say.

159
00:15:57,898 --> 00:16:02,046
Who wouldn't want a hot summer fling
in the most romantic city on earth?

160
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:06,717
I was going to tell you.

161
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:10,030
It's okay.

162
00:16:11,543 --> 00:16:12,780
Really?

163
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:13,930
You two.

164
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,654
- We never...
- Not really...

165
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:18,308
- Had a thing...
- It's complicated...

166
00:16:19,385 --> 00:16:20,744
A complicated thing.

167
00:16:20,803 --> 00:16:22,200
Never mind.

168
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:29,975
Well, um,

169
00:16:30,237 --> 00:16:32,332
I'm gonna go.

170
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,688
The awkward tension is just getting started.

171
00:16:45,717 --> 00:16:47,856
I really crashed and burned on that one.

172
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:50,010
Must be a daily ritual for you.

173
00:16:50,986 --> 00:16:53,678
Only when I'm barreling into a train wreck.

174
00:17:05,046 --> 00:17:07,508
Listen to me... I really think we're onto something here

175
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:11,333
I did my research.
Luthorcorp paid for the funeral.

176
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:14,119
Why would they do that?
It doesn't make any sens.

177
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:17,776
I guess the real question to ask would be,

178
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,378
well, why would somebody bury
an empty casket for nothing,

179
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:22,869
right, clark?

180
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:25,745
Clark?

181
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:31,200
Wow,

182
00:17:31,255 --> 00:17:33,802
she didn't take any prisoners, did she?

183
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:37,204
Lana...

184
00:17:37,277 --> 00:17:38,804
cute, smart.

185
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:40,231
Gutsy.

186
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:43,869
And way too much for you to handle.
I can see why you're in love with her.

187
00:17:43,925 --> 00:17:46,944
Look, you're really not the person
I want to talk to about this.

188
00:17:47,653 --> 00:17:49,206
Suit yourself.

189
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:57,558
It's just...

190
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:00,991
I knew she'd be dating other people.

191
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:02,063
But...

192
00:18:06,303 --> 00:18:08,177
I just don't understand how you could

193
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,014
feel like you know someone

194
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:13,150
so completely, like you know everything
about them, and then just, all of a sudden

195
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:15,151
you don't even know what continent they're on.

196
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:17,224
Do you always have to finish people's thoughts?

197
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,934
Well, am I right?

198
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:33,123
Come on!

199
00:18:33,531 --> 00:18:35,058
We gotta go!

200
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:47,364
Hi, daddy.

201
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:58,093
I thought we had an understanding.

202
00:18:58,148 --> 00:19:00,975
You were to stay away from that crime scene.

203
00:19:01,011 --> 00:19:03,412
And you were supposed to beat the pentagon.

204
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:06,632
They sent me out to fort Ryan
to oversee some maneuvers.

205
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:08,851
To keep an eye on me, is that it, boss?

206
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,205
Drop it, lo.

207
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,461
Why?

208
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:16,736
I'm obviously on to something here. You wouldn't
be calling out the birds if I was late for dinner.

209
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,372
You didn't seriously invite him to dinner.

210
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:27,100
Clark, mr. Lane is a three-star general.

211
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:29,302
I think he deserves a little respect.

212
00:19:29,321 --> 00:19:30,302
Mom,

213
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,503
mom..

214
00:19:32,595 --> 00:19:35,706
this is some place you got here, mr. and mrs. Kent.

215
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:40,390
And again, I'd like to thank you
for keeping an eye on my little lo.

216
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,938
Can I offer you a chavelo?

217
00:19:42,992 --> 00:19:45,812
Hand-rolled with some of the
finest tobacco in the U.S. Of A.

218
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:49,869
No, I, uh,

219
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:52,561
my heart isn't exactly what it used to be.

220
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:56,709
I'm gonna have to take a rain check
on your hospitality, mrs. Kent.

221
00:19:56,746 --> 00:19:59,238
- You're welcome anytime.
- Well, thank you.

222
00:19:59,421 --> 00:20:01,411
Let's double-time it, lo.

223
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,106
This is about chloe.

224
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,834
Clark, find the luthorcorp connection

225
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,149
Good night now.

226
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:17,460
Good night.

227
00:20:25,878 --> 00:20:30,007
I was assigned to the accident
in jakarta and the shuttle disaster.

228
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:31,499
Impressive.

229
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:36,992
Then maybe you could help explain to me
how a door rips off a jet at 20,000 feet.

230
00:20:37,048 --> 00:20:39,612
We found no traces of explosive residue.

231
00:20:39,668 --> 00:20:43,483
Now, all evidence suggests that the door
was extricated from outside the aircraft...

232
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:45,156
by manual force.

233
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:49,814
I'm sorry. Are you trying to tell me
someone did this from outside my plane?

234
00:20:56,526 --> 00:20:59,582
Agent stocker, will you excuse us?

235
00:21:06,313 --> 00:21:08,652
Does this mean you're talking to me again?

236
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:10,999
Only because I don't have a choice.

237
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:14,509
Relegated from friend to last resort.

238
00:21:15,383 --> 00:21:18,711
I guess I'll have to accept it if
it's my only chance to prove myself.

239
00:21:18,822 --> 00:21:19,840
Good.

240
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:22,177
Cause I want you to help me find chloe.

241
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:25,760
Look, I'd like to set things
straight between us, Clark, but

242
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:29,671
don't you think raising someone from
the grave is setting the bar a little high?

243
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:32,418
Lex, Chloe's not in her grave.

244
00:21:35,704 --> 00:21:38,615
She was the linchpin in your father's trial.

245
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:42,871
You would've had investigators
crawling all over that area.

246
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:46,473
What did they find?

247
00:21:47,477 --> 00:21:52,534
I pulled some strings and asked the FBI
not to release all the morbid details.

248
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,300
The fact is, that explosion took out an entire acre,
and the reason chloe's casket is empty is..

249
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:02,462
it's because there wasn't anything left.

250
00:22:12,076 --> 00:22:13,712
I'm sorry, Clark.

251
00:23:58,484 --> 00:24:04,312
Considering your father has a yard full of tanks out there,
I don't think you should be in his office, rifling through his files.

252
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:07,386
That didn't seem to slow you down any.

253
00:24:07,442 --> 00:24:09,541
I gotta say, I'm impressed, Smallville,

254
00:24:09,596 --> 00:24:12,342
that you could sneak on
a military base undetected.

255
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,816
What are you doing here?

256
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,434
I'm looking for you.

257
00:24:15,526 --> 00:24:18,036
I think your father's working with Lex Luthor.

258
00:24:18,382 --> 00:24:20,401
I saw one of his cigars in his library.

259
00:24:20,438 --> 00:24:22,555
I knew it. You were right.

260
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,829
Who knew?

261
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:26,939
My dad and the king of the trust fund kids.

262
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,141
They are trying to cover up
something to do with chloe.

263
00:24:29,196 --> 00:24:31,543
- And if he finds us here...
- I can handle him, clark.

264
00:24:31,724 --> 00:24:34,499
Besides, if you think that
chopper recital was something,

265
00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:37,155
you should've seen the escort I had for prom.

266
00:24:38,648 --> 00:24:41,430
Wow, and I thought my father was overprotective.

267
00:24:44,614 --> 00:24:47,418
I guess when he lost my mom,
he kinda cracked and...

268
00:24:47,473 --> 00:24:50,182
ever since, he's been scared of losing me, too.

269
00:24:54,677 --> 00:24:58,897
I can actually talkabout her.
She died when I was 6.

270
00:25:00,535 --> 00:25:01,823
I'm sorry.

271
00:25:02,004 --> 00:25:03,223
Don't be.

272
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:08,226
Unless you're the one that got her hooked
on cigarettes behind the gym during high school.

273
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:13,599
Make yourself useful.

274
00:25:25,411 --> 00:25:27,212
Nellie blye?

275
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,194
I know.

276
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:33,324
Can you believe, after 15 years,
my dad is finally getting some action?

277
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:35,497
I'm kinda happy for the old geezer.

278
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,679
She died nearly 80 years ago.

279
00:25:37,808 --> 00:25:41,756
But it saysin his calendar
that he's beentaking r&r with her

280
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,575
at least once a week.

281
00:25:43,702 --> 00:25:46,462
She was one of the first
female undercover reporters.

282
00:25:46,518 --> 00:25:48,500
She was Chloe's hero.

283
00:25:53,122 --> 00:25:56,414
It says here that she is at...

284
00:25:57,178 --> 00:25:59,913
2348 Walnut Street.

285
00:26:05,882 --> 00:26:06,918
Clark?

286
00:26:24,288 --> 00:26:25,779
Chloe?

287
00:27:06,247 --> 00:27:08,121
You were right, mr. Luthor.

288
00:27:08,158 --> 00:27:11,159
Lex's men led me right to the sullivan chick.

289
00:27:12,305 --> 00:27:14,979
It's done? You did what I asked?

290
00:27:15,089 --> 00:27:16,070
No.

291
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,174
I've kinda had a change of heart.

292
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,301
I had to kill two men.

293
00:27:20,629 --> 00:27:22,066
The price is doubled.

294
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:26,033
That was a very foolish decision, trent.

295
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:29,295
Yes, you have an extraordinary gift.

296
00:27:29,351 --> 00:27:30,933
I know that.

297
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:36,046
But wasn't it your pride in that gift
that first landed you in belle reve?

298
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,011
Don't think you understand! You don't.

299
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,148
Believe me,

300
00:27:41,186 --> 00:27:42,441
I..

301
00:27:43,187 --> 00:27:46,898
couldn't begin to imagine what
it must've been like for you.

302
00:27:47,335 --> 00:27:48,917
But, Trent,

303
00:27:49,045 --> 00:27:52,090
very few people in your life

304
00:27:52,145 --> 00:27:55,729
will ever accept you for the man you are

305
00:27:55,911 --> 00:27:59,876
Why would you turn against
the one person who would never,

306
00:28:00,066 --> 00:28:02,485
never judge you?

307
00:28:04,304 --> 00:28:06,014
I don't care.

308
00:28:07,215 --> 00:28:09,251
Then you do care.

309
00:28:12,054 --> 00:28:15,151
It's what you want, Trent...

310
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:17,407
to be normal.

311
00:28:17,535 --> 00:28:19,153
Isn't it?

312
00:28:21,356 --> 00:28:23,465
Now, I want to help.

313
00:28:24,212 --> 00:28:26,049
But I can't.

314
00:28:26,511 --> 00:28:28,530
I won't be free.

315
00:28:29,604 --> 00:28:33,534
Not if Chloe Sullivan testifies tomorrow.

316
00:28:39,722 --> 00:28:42,234
How long does it take to locate her?

317
00:28:42,816 --> 00:28:44,289
Well, do it.

318
00:28:45,832 --> 00:28:47,432
Clark, I was trying to protect her.

319
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:51,307
You had a tracking bracelet on her wrist.
You couldn't have thought she was that safe.

320
00:28:51,343 --> 00:28:53,897
I tried to take every precaution.

321
00:28:54,571 --> 00:28:57,881
You looked me straight in the eye
and told me she was dead.

322
00:28:58,955 --> 00:29:02,611
Look, sometimes you have to do the
right thing, no matter what the cost.

323
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:04,838
Even if that cost is Chloe's life.

324
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:08,131
Clark, if it wasn't for me, Chloe
would've died in that explosion.

325
00:29:08,168 --> 00:29:12,298
I felt responsible for Chloe so
I had investigators watching her.

326
00:29:12,698 --> 00:29:15,426
They found a detonating
device in the safe house,

327
00:29:15,473 --> 00:29:19,529
my father had hired someone to make sure
that Chloe never made it to that witness stand.

328
00:29:19,747 --> 00:29:22,348
I only thing I could do was beat him to it.

329
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:26,060
The house was built on tunnels
left from the underground rail road.

330
00:29:26,388 --> 00:29:30,120
Seconds after Chloe and her dad entered,
we rushed them underneath the house.

331
00:29:30,176 --> 00:29:33,468
The explosion was rigged to cave
in the tunnel behind them.

332
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:37,197
The cops never found it.

333
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:39,016
And Sam Lane?

334
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:41,334
I didn't trust the FBI.

335
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:44,118
I needed someone who could
engineer the rescue.

336
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:47,737
She's at the old foundry.

337
00:29:47,976 --> 00:29:49,212
Don't worry, Clark.

338
00:29:49,267 --> 00:29:51,886
I'll have people over there in minutes.

339
00:29:51,944 --> 00:29:53,745
Get me general Lane.

340
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:48,125
What the hell is that?

341
00:31:53,255 --> 00:31:55,918
Chloe always told me this town is weird.

342
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,227
I don't know how you ever
survived without me.

343
00:32:03,608 --> 00:32:05,183
How did you get here, anyway?

344
00:32:05,238 --> 00:32:07,948
What do you mean, how did I get
here? How did you get here?

345
00:32:07,986 --> 00:32:09,295
Chloe!

346
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:12,951
Chloe, are you okay? Chloe?

347
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:15,171
Chloe.

348
00:32:16,026 --> 00:32:18,118
I was afraid I'd lost you.

349
00:32:30,457 --> 00:32:31,548
Lois?

350
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:34,357
Lois, what are you doing here?

351
00:32:34,412 --> 00:32:35,613
Lois!

352
00:32:36,904 --> 00:32:39,887
Putting the worst two months
of my life behind me.

353
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:47,793
Oh, my god. I am so glad I found you.

354
00:32:47,848 --> 00:32:49,158
I..?

355
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,561
If you guys don't mind,
I'd really like to get outta here.

356
00:32:55,617 --> 00:32:56,551
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

357
00:32:57,316 --> 00:32:58,735
Let's get you outta here,

358
00:32:58,881 --> 00:33:01,882
Before Lionel throws any more freaks at you.

359
00:33:01,973 --> 00:33:07,085
Because tomorrow morning in court,
I am gonna kick Lionel's butt.

360
00:33:11,795 --> 00:33:13,598
"Guilty!"

361
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,005
"Jury returns verdict
in high profile case. "

362
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:20,852
it's good to see that there's some things
even Lionel Luthor can't buy his way out of.

363
00:33:20,888 --> 00:33:22,623
Thanks to Chloe.

364
00:33:22,732 --> 00:33:24,169
Clark,

365
00:33:24,206 --> 00:33:25,898
as much as I hate to admit this,

366
00:33:25,935 --> 00:33:27,681
Lex had a handin it, too.

367
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,027
He did make good on
his promise to protect Chloe.

368
00:33:30,064 --> 00:33:33,272
And look what he got out of it
control of Luthorcorp.

369
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:39,150
Look, I'm sorry, but it's gonna take a lot more
than that for met o get to trust him again.

370
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:43,261
Ever since he met you, he's been
surrounded by things he can't explain.

371
00:33:43,297 --> 00:33:46,054
We can't really blame him
for trying to find the truth.

372
00:33:46,127 --> 00:33:49,256
The truth is, he's been
lying to me from day one.

373
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:53,586
The legend on the cave wall says
I'm destined to have an enemy.

374
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,277
All this time, I've been worried about Lionel.

375
00:33:58,332 --> 00:34:01,679
But I'm beginning to think that the
real threat was right in front of me.

376
00:34:02,735 --> 00:34:04,627
I think it's Lex.

377
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,249
Lana.

378
00:34:22,488 --> 00:34:24,486
What are you doing down here?

379
00:34:25,141 --> 00:34:27,452
Probably the same thing you are.

380
00:34:30,726 --> 00:34:32,345
It's peaceful.

381
00:34:34,456 --> 00:34:36,148
You're 2 for 2.

382
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:40,886
You keep showing up when
I least expect to see you.

383
00:34:41,305 --> 00:34:44,051
I'm not trying to surprise you, Clark.

384
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:48,126
I know. It's just when you left, I...
wasn't sure when I'd see you again.

385
00:34:50,123 --> 00:34:51,833
It's funny, isn't it?

386
00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:57,545
After everything we've been through,

387
00:34:59,146 --> 00:35:02,093
I thought it would take us longer to get over it.

388
00:35:03,021 --> 00:35:04,538
Us?

389
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,685
You and lois.

390
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:09,486
Lois?

391
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,307
She's bossy.

392
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:20,463
She's stuck-up, she's rude.

393
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:22,282
I can't stand her.

394
00:35:24,629 --> 00:35:27,412
The best ones always start that way.

395
00:35:38,707 --> 00:35:41,017
Do you believe in destiny?

396
00:35:44,294 --> 00:35:46,131
I don't want to.

397
00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:49,733
But you can't escape it, can you,

398
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:52,844
even if you don't know what it is yet?

399
00:35:55,063 --> 00:35:57,446
Lana, what is it you're not telling me?

400
00:35:58,428 --> 00:36:00,666
Does it have something
to do with this guy you met?

401
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,650
No, no.
Um, no, it doesn't.

402
00:36:05,395 --> 00:36:08,506
But I'm sorry that you
found out the way you did.

403
00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:12,009
I should go.

404
00:36:42,712 --> 00:36:44,495
Well done, Lex.

405
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,232
But wasn't it you who warned me,

406
00:36:49,268 --> 00:36:52,743
don't wound what you cannot kill?

407
00:37:02,712 --> 00:37:06,277
Oh, and, dad...

408
00:37:08,825 --> 00:37:11,735
I wouldn't have missed this for the world.

409
00:37:55,036 --> 00:37:56,109
Hi.

410
00:38:00,549 --> 00:38:03,703
I'm freaking you out with the whole
cary grant moment, aren't I?

411
00:38:08,529 --> 00:38:10,741
What are you doing here?

412
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:13,652
Giving you time.

413
00:38:22,143 --> 00:38:23,743
They're beautiful.

414
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:31,479
I, uh, found this.

415
00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:39,435
"Jason, I had to go back home.
I wish I had time to explain. "

416
00:38:39,847 --> 00:38:41,706
So now you do.

417
00:38:47,746 --> 00:38:50,481
I'm sorry, Jason. I, uh...

418
00:38:52,991 --> 00:38:54,859
I don't know what to say.

419
00:38:56,382 --> 00:38:57,749
It's okay.

420
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,388
It's all right.

421
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:06,695
You know, I kept trying to convince
myself that this wasn't about me, but...

422
00:39:08,035 --> 00:39:10,814
you can't really put that in a note, can you?

423
00:39:20,373 --> 00:39:21,726
Wait.

424
00:39:25,133 --> 00:39:28,034
Jason, I'm not sorry to see you.

425
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,217
You know, it's just...

426
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:32,924
you came all this way, and I just... I wish...

427
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:35,418
that I had a better explanation for you

428
00:39:35,972 --> 00:39:38,897
For why you left Paris
or why you left me?

429
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:41,182
You know how I feel about you.

430
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:45,255
That hasn't changed.

431
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:51,077
But I can't go back.

432
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:55,766
Lana, I didn't come here to get you.

433
00:39:57,907 --> 00:40:00,351
I came here to be with you.

434
00:40:19,507 --> 00:40:23,507
