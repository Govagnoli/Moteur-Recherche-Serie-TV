1
00:00:04,052 --> 00:00:06,350
Okay, people, you've got fifteen minutes.

2
00:00:06,521 --> 00:00:10,150
Storm's on its way, and I want to be
on the road before it hits.

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,659
How many more rocks do we have to find?

4
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:18,162
-Two. Rose quartz and meteor rock.
-All right, let's see who can find it first.

5
00:00:45,693 --> 00:00:47,217
Make that one.

6
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:52,097
You're a regular rock hound, Clark.

7
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,639
Hey, Clark.

8
00:01:02,343 --> 00:01:03,640
Hey, Lana.

9
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:11,008
When is this whole geological
scavenger hunt over?

10
00:01:11,185 --> 00:01:12,982
Not having much luck?

11
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:16,415
-Someone's doing more ranting than digging.
-I'm sorry...

12
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:19,151
...but I find geology
even more pointless than algebra.

13
00:01:19,327 --> 00:01:23,627
I could order these rocks online and have
them delivered to my house, vacuum-sealed.

14
00:01:35,176 --> 00:01:38,270
Hey, Holly, do you want
a piece of meteor rock?

15
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:41,279
Oh, I've got it checked off already.
Thanks, anyway.

16
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:43,144
No problem, anytime.

17
00:01:44,318 --> 00:01:47,310
Hey, loser, stop hitting
on my girlfriend, all right?

18
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:49,922
Next time, I knock your rocks
into the next county.

19
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:52,559
-Yeah, I'd like to see you try.
-Oh, yeah?

20
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:55,691
Lucky your daddy's a teacher.

21
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:58,028
Eric?

22
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,834
How many samples have you collected?

23
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:04,733
-Just a couple, my glasses keep fogging up.
-Get with the program, Eric.

24
00:02:04,906 --> 00:02:07,841
-But, Dad--
-It's Mr. Summers at school.

25
00:02:08,376 --> 00:02:13,006
You have 10 minutes to complete this
assignment. You'd better find every rock.

26
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:20,280
Glad he's not my dad.

27
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:29,763
Has anyone seen Eric?
Apparently he's gotten himself lost.

28
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:32,223
I'll find him.

29
00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:02,421
Eric! Eric!

30
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:48,196
Clark!

31
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,568
I could really use your help.

32
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,069
I loaded all the hay, my--

33
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:55,300
Hey.

34
00:04:55,743 --> 00:04:56,869
You all right?

35
00:04:57,044 --> 00:04:58,568
Yeah, I'm just a little tired.

36
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:00,771
The truck's stuck
up to its axle in mud and--

37
00:05:00,948 --> 00:05:05,009
-The cows aren't going to feed themselves.
-Yeah. Can you give me a hand, please?

38
00:05:09,357 --> 00:05:11,052
-Ready?
-Ready!

39
00:05:16,063 --> 00:05:17,291
Hang on!

40
00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:22,858
Okay!

41
00:05:23,037 --> 00:05:25,733
-Clark, are you pushing?
-Yeah!

42
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,139
Clark....

43
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:36,940
Come on, son,
we don't have time to--

44
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:45,890
What happened?

45
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:50,855
I don't know.

46
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:59,037
Here's a clean coat, sweetie,
are you feeling better?

47
00:05:59,206 --> 00:06:02,334
I just don't understand what's wrong
with me. And why am I bleeding?

48
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,911
Maybe it's just a part of
your development, like x-ray vision...

49
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,208
...or maybe the lightning had
something to do with it, I don't know.

50
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:12,078
I am going to be okay, right?

51
00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:15,753
What you ought to do is go to school...

52
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:19,620
...and if anything else happens
or it gets worse, give us a call.

53
00:06:24,198 --> 00:06:27,031
You know, it's weird. I never
worried about being sick before.

54
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:30,466
You're not sick, Clark,
you're just not yourself.

55
00:06:30,638 --> 00:06:33,266
Oh, you just missed your bus,
you'd better hurry.

56
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:44,916
-Something wrong?
-My speed's gone too.

57
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:04,526
Morning, Mom.

58
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:08,300
-Morning, Dad.
-You're late, and I can't wait for you.

59
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:13,102
Just give him five minutes,
what's the hurry?

60
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,907
I have a faculty meeting.

61
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:16,208
Fine.

62
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:18,352
I'll take you
when you're ready to go.

63
00:07:21,422 --> 00:07:22,753
Thanks.

64
00:07:23,457 --> 00:07:26,893
-Mr. Summers.
-Don't you take that tone with me.

65
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:31,389
Your little stunt yesterday
almost cost a fellow student his life.

66
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:36,002
-I can only apologize so many times.
-It was stupid and selfish.

67
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,604
Why don't you save the speeches
for your classroom?

68
00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:45,272
-How did you do that?
-You're the science teacher, figure it out.

69
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,877
Get a ride with your mother.

70
00:07:57,024 --> 00:07:58,582
You feeling okay?

71
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:00,519
Yeah, why?

72
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:04,562
Usually you run without breaking a sweat.
Today you look like you're about to die.

73
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:06,256
No, I'm fine.

74
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:10,092
-What's wrong?
-My leg, it hurts.

75
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:12,739
It's a cramp, walk it off.

76
00:08:16,277 --> 00:08:18,575
You're falling apart today, Clark.

77
00:08:24,785 --> 00:08:25,945
Eric.

78
00:08:26,353 --> 00:08:27,615
Hey, you got a minute?

79
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:29,915
Yeah, sure. What's up?

80
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:34,320
We really didn't get a chance to talk
after what happened yesterday.

81
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:38,189
Yeah, thanks for grabbing me.
That was a stupid move on my part.

82
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:41,432
So you feeling all right?

83
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,831
Actually, I feel great.

84
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:47,030
But there's nothing different about you?

85
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,005
Why, should there be?

86
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:52,373
No, I'm just glad you're okay.

87
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:55,472
Clark...

88
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:57,344
...your nose is bleeding.

89
00:09:40,427 --> 00:09:42,895
-Thanks for the ride.
-You're welcome.

90
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:47,199
-Wanna come in to say hi to Nell?
-I can't.

91
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:50,201
I've gotta get over to the store.
Stock day.

92
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:51,895
See you tonight?

93
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,502
I've gotta run the numbers
over to my dad at the hospital.

94
00:09:55,676 --> 00:09:59,237
-I thought he was supposed to be recovering.
-He is, he's just....

95
00:09:59,413 --> 00:10:01,677
He needs to feel like he's in control.

96
00:10:01,849 --> 00:10:03,749
How are you doing?

97
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:06,041
Not that great.

98
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,451
Can't get my homework done, I can't train.

99
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:12,251
Might as well kiss my scholarship goodbye.

100
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:15,785
Come over tonight, I'll help you
with your homework.

101
00:10:21,468 --> 00:10:24,733
Hey, when did Nell
put the shop up for sale?

102
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:26,497
What?

103
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:31,106
Why didn't you tell me
you were selling the shop?

104
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:33,508
I'm sorry, I only made
the decision this morning.

105
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:37,583
-When were you planning on telling me?
-I don't understand why you're so upset.

106
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:40,777
I mean, you've never shown
any interest in this store before.

107
00:10:40,955 --> 00:10:43,116
And now I'm supposed to consult you?

108
00:10:44,258 --> 00:10:48,160
-Are you selling the movie theater as well?
-Yes, Lana, it's part of the building.

109
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:50,592
You know how much it means to me.

110
00:10:50,764 --> 00:10:53,289
If I'd made business decisions
based on sentiment...

111
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:56,231
...I would have gone bust a long time ago.

112
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,130
Besides, the movie theater's
been closed for months now.

113
00:10:59,306 --> 00:11:01,831
I'll sell the building
and relocate to a smaller store.

114
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:06,105
-There has to be another way.
-Look, I'm just thinking of our future.

115
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,881
Finished with the hay.

116
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:16,317
How you holding up?

117
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:20,085
Considering my chores used to take five
minutes and now they take two hours...

118
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,249
...l'm all right.

119
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:25,797
Well, as long as you don't get any worse,
I guess we can count our blessings.

120
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:27,991
I'd better get to that fence before dinner.

121
00:11:28,168 --> 00:11:30,728
You need your rest.
I'll take care of it in the morning.

122
00:11:30,904 --> 00:11:34,203
-Oh, Dad, I can do it.
-All right, but just remember something.

123
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:38,539
It took 12 years to get used to your abilities.
Nobody expects you to adjust in 24 hours.

124
00:11:38,712 --> 00:11:39,736
Get the gate.

125
00:11:39,913 --> 00:11:41,210
-Hey, Dad.
-Yeah.

126
00:11:41,382 --> 00:11:43,680
How do you find the strength
to do this every day?

127
00:11:44,118 --> 00:11:45,608
Years of practice.

128
00:11:49,657 --> 00:11:51,522
This is very good work, Roger.

129
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:55,219
All the physical evidence
points to this explanation.

130
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:59,162
I'm sure you consulted a rogue's gallery
of qualified professionals.

131
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,029
A journalist never reveals his sources.

132
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:04,693
<i>You work for the Inquisitor, not the Planet.</i>

133
00:12:04,872 --> 00:12:08,774
I want to verify these experts myself.
I'll give you 10 grand a name.

134
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:10,409
Done.

135
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:13,910
This will make one hell of a story.

136
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:16,413
Nobody's ever going to know about this.

137
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,848
And if this story is accidentally leaked...

138
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,511
...you and I are going to have
a serious trust issue.

139
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:27,286
As opposed to the close,
personal relationship we enjoy now.

140
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,221
Lex, what brings you all the way out here?

141
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:04,125
I needed to talk.

142
00:13:04,298 --> 00:13:07,358
-You have a minute?
-lf you wanna help me with this fence.

143
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:11,628
You can't lift that by yourself?

144
00:13:11,805 --> 00:13:15,969
Look, I've been baling hay for the last
two hours, I can barely lift my own arms.

145
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:22,014
So, what's up?

146
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,710
We're friends, right?

147
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:28,751
Yeah, last time I checked. Why?

148
00:13:30,457 --> 00:13:34,655
I want you to tell me what really happened
the day my car went off that bridge.

149
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:39,522
I dove in and I pulled you out.

150
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:44,130
-And that's it?
-Lex, seriously, what's wrong?

151
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:48,172
I don't think you're being completely honest,
and I think I know why.

152
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:52,838
All right, well, then,
you tell me what happened.

153
00:13:53,814 --> 00:13:56,612
I think I hit you at 60 miles an hour...

154
00:13:57,885 --> 00:14:02,652
...then you ripped open my roof,
pulled me out and saved my life.

155
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:06,926
You're the closest I've had
to a real friend my whole life.

156
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:11,497
-You don't have to hide anything from me.
-You think I'm hiding something from you?

157
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:15,334
Okay, here.

158
00:14:15,502 --> 00:14:18,096
Take this hammer. Hit me anywhere.

159
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:20,965
-I'm not going to hit you, Clark.
-Come on!

160
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:24,338
-lf I can get hit by a car, you can't hurt me.
-I just want the truth.

161
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,537
The truth is, I'm just a guy
who tried to do the right thing!

162
00:14:27,714 --> 00:14:29,841
Isn't that enough?

163
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:07,952
Apparently, Clark is still doing his chores
and that's why he blew us off.

164
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:09,679
He's been acting weird lately.

165
00:15:09,857 --> 00:15:12,189
Well, Clark's always acting weird.
Give me a gauge.

166
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:15,385
He was so tired in math class today,
he face-planted on his desk.

167
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:17,826
I have two words for him: Power Bar.

168
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:28,140
Give me my laptop!

169
00:15:32,713 --> 00:15:35,204
-Give it back.
-Get out of my way, kid.

170
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,633
-Did you see that?
-Yeah. Unbelievable.

171
00:16:02,276 --> 00:16:04,744
Thank you. That was amazing.

172
00:16:05,345 --> 00:16:06,835
Any time.

173
00:16:15,956 --> 00:16:17,947
Guess we know what happened
to your powers.

174
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,286
Must have been the lightning strike.

175
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,258
You said that Eric was holding a meteor rock.

176
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,160
It must have transferred
your powers somehow.

177
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:29,428
You know, all those years of hiding...

178
00:16:29,603 --> 00:16:31,298
...I wonder if it was worth it.

179
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:33,831
Everyone's fine with Eric.

180
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:36,936
Well, that's just for now, Clark.

181
00:16:38,545 --> 00:16:41,776
Well, the question is whether
it's temporary or permanent.

182
00:16:44,184 --> 00:16:48,018
You know what they say: Lightning
never strikes twice in the same place.

183
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,626
Look....

184
00:16:54,294 --> 00:16:57,730
My guess is that your powers
aren't coming back.

185
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,464
Maybe being normal won't be so bad.

186
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,635
-I mean, it works for you and Mom.
-Oh, thanks.

187
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,008
You don't feel any differently
about me now, do you?

188
00:17:13,747 --> 00:17:15,112
Clark....

189
00:17:17,217 --> 00:17:22,553
You're our son, whether you can
bench-press the tractor or not.

190
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,425
What do I do now?

191
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:31,898
Well, life isn't easy for anybody...

192
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:36,331
...whether you're normal or super,
but you're still Clark Kent.

193
00:17:36,503 --> 00:17:40,371
And you were raised a certain way
and that's never gonna change.

194
00:17:41,074 --> 00:17:44,202
Sure, your abilities were a part of you,
but they didn't define you.

195
00:17:44,378 --> 00:17:49,077
Look on the bright side, Clark.
You don't have to hide anymore.

196
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:52,047
Try to have some fun.

197
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:04,092
You're kind of relieved, aren't you?

198
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:08,394
Well, he always said he wanted to be normal.
Guess he got his wish.

199
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,770
You should have seen it.
Eric threw the guy 30 feet.

200
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:14,806
And not only did he recover my laptop...

201
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:17,341
<i>...but I got my first byline
in the Smallville Ledger.</i>

202
00:18:17,477 --> 00:18:18,466
That's great, Chloe.

203
00:18:18,645 --> 00:18:21,443
Come on, Clark, how can
you be so blase about this?

204
00:18:21,615 --> 00:18:24,607
The guy stopped a purse-snatcher.
It's not that big a deal.

205
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:29,113
Hey, thanks for getting
that story in the paper.

206
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:32,315
Thanks for saving my computer, it's my life.

207
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:35,518
Okay, how pathetic did that just sound?

208
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:39,121
-So who came up with "Superboy"?
-I did.

209
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:40,894
Really?

210
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:43,896
-I like that.
-Thanks.

211
00:18:47,908 --> 00:18:50,706
-I thought it was kind of lame.
-I don't remember asking you.

212
00:18:50,877 --> 00:18:52,435
Clark's just jealous.

213
00:18:52,612 --> 00:18:55,979
I hope all this attention doesn't
go to his head. He needs to be careful.

214
00:18:56,149 --> 00:18:58,515
You know what?
Start throwing people 30 feet...

215
00:18:58,652 --> 00:19:00,847
...and I'll write nice things about you too.

216
00:19:00,987 --> 00:19:02,750
"Love from Superboy."

217
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,956
-Hi, guys.
-Hey.

218
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:13,596
Clark, are you okay?

219
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:15,968
I'm great.

220
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:18,834
I'm getting a pickup
game together in the gym.

221
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:21,439
You and Kent versus me and Brent,
what do you say?

222
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:23,701
-Clark doesn't really play.
-No, I play.

223
00:19:24,344 --> 00:19:26,403
Great. Bring it on.

224
00:19:28,615 --> 00:19:30,173
Since when do you play?

225
00:19:31,151 --> 00:19:32,584
Since now.

226
00:19:34,855 --> 00:19:36,755
First one to 15 wins.

227
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,538
If you're interested, we play
every Tuesday and Thursday.

228
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:32,269
-Good game, good game, man.
-Too bad, Clark.

229
00:20:33,113 --> 00:20:36,241
-Why are you grinning? We lost.
-I know. Pretty cool, huh?

230
00:20:43,823 --> 00:20:46,189
Lex, you remember Dad?

231
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:52,054
Sir Harry? Victoria,
I've been waiting 45 minutes.

232
00:20:52,232 --> 00:20:54,792
Oh. We were closing a deal.

233
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:57,402
City of Metropolis giving you
the recycling contract?

234
00:20:57,571 --> 00:20:58,765
Lex.

235
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:01,406
You seem upset.

236
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:05,773
If this is the respect you show your partners,
I wonder if I made the right decision.

237
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:08,938
You see, Lex, it doesn't really matter.

238
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:11,913
The deal is off.

239
00:21:12,752 --> 00:21:15,482
I thought it was your life's ambition
to crush my father.

240
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:21,594
No, that's your life's ambition.
Mine is to take over LuthorCorp.

241
00:21:24,231 --> 00:21:26,131
How do you plan to do that?

242
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:29,393
You heard of Cadmus Labs?

243
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:37,637
-I've been researching them for about a year.
-Well...

244
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:39,938
...your research has just paid off.

245
00:21:40,113 --> 00:21:42,946
I bought them. An hour ago.

246
00:21:43,883 --> 00:21:47,842
And with the profits you'll reap from their
patents, you'll buy LuthorCorp outright.

247
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:50,080
Tell your father...

248
00:21:51,091 --> 00:21:53,525
...I said hello. Come on, girl.

249
00:22:01,735 --> 00:22:03,600
Congratulations.

250
00:22:05,772 --> 00:22:08,172
I hope it was worth it.

251
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:30,254
Tried to score the last box of jujubes
before this place is sold?

252
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:33,524
Those things could probably survive
a nuclear winter.

253
00:22:38,104 --> 00:22:41,631
You must have a thing about
bad sound and stale popcorn.

254
00:22:42,976 --> 00:22:45,035
My parents met here.

255
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,775
My dad worked the concession stand
during college...

256
00:22:48,948 --> 00:22:53,078
<i>...and my mom came to see
Close Encounters. She got bored.</i>

257
00:22:54,421 --> 00:22:56,582
<i>How do you get bored
watching Close Encounters?</i>

258
00:22:56,756 --> 00:23:01,386
I don't know.
Maybe she had a thing against aliens.

259
00:23:02,162 --> 00:23:07,099
She hung out in the lobby and spent
the entire night talking to my dad.

260
00:23:07,267 --> 00:23:10,828
They'd only been a few years apart in school
but never noticed each other.

261
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,428
That night, they just clicked.

262
00:23:14,974 --> 00:23:17,306
I know it sounds kind of crazy...

263
00:23:17,477 --> 00:23:23,245
...but I feel that whatever tangible evidence
I have of my parents' existence...

264
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:25,941
...is slowly being chipped away.

265
00:23:27,987 --> 00:23:31,514
Sometimes letting go
is the only way to move forward.

266
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:34,484
I guess you're right.

267
00:23:35,895 --> 00:23:38,796
Besides, there's nothing I can do to stop it.

268
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:44,269
How'd you find me anyway?

269
00:23:44,437 --> 00:23:47,668
Nell told me. I was wondering
if I could borrow your English notes.

270
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:49,968
I kind of dozed off in class.

271
00:23:50,143 --> 00:23:51,940
Sure.

272
00:23:57,917 --> 00:23:59,908
Have you been feeling okay lately?

273
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,481
Yeah, great, why?

274
00:24:02,655 --> 00:24:07,490
Nothing, you're just less Clark Kent-like.

275
00:24:08,728 --> 00:24:10,093
It's kind of nice.

276
00:24:10,263 --> 00:24:14,666
You seem more relaxed, like you haven't got
the weight of the world on your shoulders.

277
00:24:15,568 --> 00:24:18,765
Well, I guess I woke up
and realized my life had changed.

278
00:24:18,938 --> 00:24:23,068
I decided to kick back and accept
the fact I couldn't control everything.

279
00:24:24,811 --> 00:24:28,338
Maybe I should adopt
that philosophy myself.

280
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,108
Mom!

281
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,451
Hey, have you seen the paper?

282
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:38,557
People have been calling all day.
It's wonderful, dear.

283
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:40,989
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

284
00:24:44,264 --> 00:24:46,755
-Are you afraid of me?
-Eric.

285
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,036
We're just a little concerned about
this new-found strength you have.

286
00:24:51,204 --> 00:24:53,263
Where'd it come from?

287
00:24:53,907 --> 00:24:55,431
It must have been the lightning.

288
00:24:55,608 --> 00:25:00,136
-I've set up an appointment with Dr. Litvak.
-Dad, I'm not sick.

289
00:25:00,547 --> 00:25:01,536
I'm special.

290
00:25:01,714 --> 00:25:05,514
Once you get a clean bill of health,
we'll take you to Metropolis.

291
00:25:08,488 --> 00:25:10,285
Well, what are we gonna do there?

292
00:25:10,457 --> 00:25:13,324
I've got an old colleague who's
a professor at the university.

293
00:25:13,493 --> 00:25:16,121
-He wants to meet you.
-Don't you mean study me?

294
00:25:17,063 --> 00:25:20,464
I'm not one of your damn
science experiments, Dad!

295
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,933
This is about you, Dad,
it's always about you!

296
00:25:24,537 --> 00:25:26,334
Even with this, it's still not enough!

297
00:25:26,506 --> 00:25:30,806
You might be special, but you still live
under my roof and you will do as I say.

298
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:35,541
I am not a freak
and I am not going anywhere!

299
00:25:35,715 --> 00:25:37,945
Eric, put me down.

300
00:25:38,117 --> 00:25:40,711
What are you gonna do, Dad,
ground me, huh?

301
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:44,152
I never have to listen to you ever again.

302
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:48,824
I can do whatever I want
and have whoever I want...

303
00:25:48,995 --> 00:25:51,486
...and no one can stop me.

304
00:26:10,383 --> 00:26:14,843
-Hey. You want to go out sometime?
-What do you think you're doing, Summers?

305
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:17,012
I'm asking Holly out.

306
00:26:18,091 --> 00:26:21,857
Are you suicidal? You're not going out
with my girlfriend, all right?

307
00:26:22,028 --> 00:26:23,052
-Watch me.
-Hey!

308
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:26,721
You make the cover of the paper with
some stunt, suddenly you're somebody?

309
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,959
-Brent.
-Face it, Summers.

310
00:26:29,135 --> 00:26:30,830
You're still nothing.

311
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:37,642
All right, man. Don't do it.

312
00:26:47,987 --> 00:26:50,922
What's the problem, Brent?
Why are you hiding from nothing?

313
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,014
Eric, you can't do this!

314
00:27:16,182 --> 00:27:17,615
-Watch me.
-No, I'm serious.

315
00:27:17,784 --> 00:27:22,016
You could kill someone. You don't want
that on your conscience. Just calm down.

316
00:27:22,188 --> 00:27:26,147
You're not my father, Clark.
Now shut up and get out of my way!

317
00:27:32,532 --> 00:27:35,023
Get away from us, you freak!

318
00:27:49,749 --> 00:27:51,341
Just a little higher.

319
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:53,446
How much longer is it gonna hurt?

320
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,111
-You'll be fine in a couple of weeks.
-A couple weeks?

321
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:58,416
What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.

322
00:27:59,926 --> 00:28:01,257
Clark!

323
00:28:01,995 --> 00:28:04,361
-Easy on the ribs, Mom.
-How's he doing, doc?

324
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:08,193
Well, nothing seems to be broken.
We could get an x-ray just to be safe.

325
00:28:08,368 --> 00:28:10,700
I think we'll just take him on home.

326
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,668
It's your choice, but I wanna
see him back in a week.

327
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,864
Thanks, doc.

328
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:18,238
You help him get dressed,
and I'll go take care of the paperwork.

329
00:28:18,845 --> 00:28:20,335
What happened?

330
00:28:20,747 --> 00:28:23,272
Eric just flipped out,
it was kind of scary.

331
00:28:23,449 --> 00:28:26,475
-I wish you hadn't gotten in his way.
-I don't know what it is.

332
00:28:26,653 --> 00:28:30,555
Even though Eric has my abilities,
I still think of them as my responsibility.

333
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,958
Clark, I just heard.

334
00:28:33,126 --> 00:28:36,254
Hi, Lex.
I'll go see your dad. See you.

335
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:39,227
So did you come by to make sure I was hurt?

336
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:41,594
I wanted to make sure you were all right.

337
00:28:41,768 --> 00:28:42,757
Yeah, never better.

338
00:28:42,935 --> 00:28:45,699
We can go out in the parking lot.
You can hit me with your car.

339
00:28:45,872 --> 00:28:46,896
Clark.

340
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:50,600
What I said about you the other day,
I'm sorry.

341
00:28:51,244 --> 00:28:53,303
Nothing appears to be what it seems lately.

342
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:56,209
You gonna stop snooping
around my back now?

343
00:28:56,683 --> 00:28:59,243
Listen. I had no right
to question your honesty.

344
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:02,252
All I can do is plead temporary insanity...

345
00:29:02,422 --> 00:29:05,152
...and hope we can find a way
to put this behind us.

346
00:29:06,693 --> 00:29:08,354
Only temporary?

347
00:29:11,497 --> 00:29:13,658
You need some help?

348
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:21,105
Yes, thank you.

349
00:29:23,743 --> 00:29:26,473
Eric. Where have you been?

350
00:29:26,646 --> 00:29:28,307
I really messed up.
I need your help.

351
00:29:28,481 --> 00:29:31,279
Your father spoke with Principal Kwan.
We know what happened.

352
00:29:31,451 --> 00:29:33,442
No, Mom, it was an accident.

353
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:37,146
-Mom, don't be afraid of me!
-Stay away from her, Eric.

354
00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:38,950
What are you doing, Dad?

355
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:43,459
I told you that some day, you'd have to
take responsibility for your actions.

356
00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:45,597
Well, that day has come.

357
00:29:52,672 --> 00:29:55,072
-What did you do?
-Eric, you need help.

358
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:57,209
So you called the police?

359
00:29:57,877 --> 00:30:00,744
You're my dad.
You're supposed to protect me.

360
00:30:08,821 --> 00:30:11,016
I stopped by to see
Eric's parents this morning.

361
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,454
-How are they?
-They're scared, Clark.

362
00:30:16,896 --> 00:30:19,091
Were you ever scared of me?

363
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,565
Well...

364
00:30:23,569 --> 00:30:26,333
...you threw a few temper tantrums
when you were little...

365
00:30:26,506 --> 00:30:28,838
...we had some holes in the walls...

366
00:30:29,475 --> 00:30:31,204
...but, no.

367
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:36,271
-You were a good kid, Clark.
-I don't think Eric's a bad kid.

368
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:40,852
Neither do I, he's just a teenager
who's in way over his head, that's all.

369
00:30:43,055 --> 00:30:46,252
You know, when this first happened,
I was kind of freaked out...

370
00:30:46,793 --> 00:30:48,693
...but now I'm kind of enjoying it.

371
00:30:49,395 --> 00:30:53,456
I played basketball for the first time
without worrying if I'd hurt anyone.

372
00:30:53,633 --> 00:30:58,263
I can be around Lana
without her necklace making me feel sick.

373
00:30:58,437 --> 00:31:02,066
Even this is better than being around
the meteor rocks, any day of the week.

374
00:31:02,241 --> 00:31:06,143
Something happened at Eric's house. The
police came, but they couldn't control him.

375
00:31:06,312 --> 00:31:08,746
-I have to stop him.
-You're hurt, remember?

376
00:31:08,915 --> 00:31:11,179
If you try to face him again,
he could kill you.

377
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,842
He has my strength.
Maybe he has my weakness too.

378
00:31:15,021 --> 00:31:17,114
The meteor rocks?

379
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,758
No one else knows how to stop him.

380
00:31:19,926 --> 00:31:23,555
Mom, this is who I am,
whether I have my powers or not.

381
00:31:24,764 --> 00:31:28,325
Clark, what about a meteor rock?
It's not like we keep them laying around.

382
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,767
I know where to find one.

383
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:43,607
I got an urgent call you wanted to see me?

384
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,918
-How'd you do it, Lex?
-Do what?

385
00:31:47,086 --> 00:31:51,284
-Cadmus Labs. It's worthless.
-I know.

386
00:31:51,457 --> 00:31:54,915
Maybe you should have done your homework
before acquiring it so recklessly.

387
00:31:55,094 --> 00:31:58,495
Now you've left yourself open
for a hostile takeover.

388
00:31:59,065 --> 00:32:00,191
I read the report!

389
00:32:00,366 --> 00:32:02,960
You mean that piece of fiction
you stole off my computer?

390
00:32:03,135 --> 00:32:05,831
Is this your idea of having it covered?

391
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:11,968
That's what you get for trusting family.

392
00:32:12,144 --> 00:32:16,171
My father and I will be making an offer
on your company in the morning.

393
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:19,117
I'll tell him you said hello.

394
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,287
-How could you do this to me, Lex?
-You did it to yourself, Victoria.

395
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,293
You thought you could make bones
with Daddy by taking me down.

396
00:32:30,463 --> 00:32:34,365
-It was just business.
-You call sleeping with me business?

397
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:36,865
I'd hate to think what that makes you.

398
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,875
-We could have been great together.
-I plan on being great all by myself.

399
00:32:46,045 --> 00:32:49,208
You'd better check on your dad,
he didn't look well.

400
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:03,824
I was driving by, I saw the light on.
I figured it was you.

401
00:33:05,531 --> 00:33:06,555
Are you okay?

402
00:33:06,732 --> 00:33:09,724
I called the house earlier,
but your mom said you were asleep.

403
00:33:09,902 --> 00:33:13,065
-I was really scared.
-I'm sorry.

404
00:33:14,073 --> 00:33:16,940
How do you think Eric
got that strong overnight?

405
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,168
I have no idea.

406
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:22,872
Can you imagine waking up
one morning and having powers?

407
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:25,111
It's scary.

408
00:33:28,187 --> 00:33:31,748
I guess. I mean, look at Eric,
it hasn't helped him.

409
00:33:31,924 --> 00:33:33,516
That's true.

410
00:33:34,293 --> 00:33:36,454
But I've still always wished I could fly.

411
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:38,995
Yeah, that'd be something, Lana.

412
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:44,866
What is it?

413
00:33:47,006 --> 00:33:48,940
It's your necklace.

414
00:33:49,442 --> 00:33:53,310
I never realized
how beautiful it was until now.

415
00:33:54,213 --> 00:33:56,511
This is gonna sound really strange.

416
00:33:57,984 --> 00:33:59,747
Could I borrow it?

417
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,487
Sure.

418
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,121
What do you need it for?

419
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,430
It's complicated.

420
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:19,059
Whatever happens to me,
I promise you'll get this back.

421
00:34:20,406 --> 00:34:24,467
You're scaring me again.
What is going on?

422
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:33,978
Goodbye, Lana.

423
00:35:10,556 --> 00:35:13,354
-Clark, what are you doing here?
-I was worried about Eric.

424
00:35:13,526 --> 00:35:16,086
It's a police problem now.
Damn kid's out of control.

425
00:35:16,262 --> 00:35:17,820
Look what he's done to the house.

426
00:35:19,098 --> 00:35:21,191
Do you have any idea where he went?

427
00:35:22,768 --> 00:35:25,601
He talked about getting rid of it.

428
00:35:25,771 --> 00:35:28,501
Said that there was only
one place he could do that...

429
00:35:28,674 --> 00:35:31,040
...whatever that means.

430
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:44,683
Eric!

431
00:35:44,857 --> 00:35:46,017
Eric!

432
00:35:51,297 --> 00:35:52,423
Eric, don't!

433
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:04,770
Eric!

434
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,812
You should have let me go
the first time, Clark.

435
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:14,417
-Would have been better than living like this.
-Eric, why'd you jump off that dam?

436
00:36:14,587 --> 00:36:18,921
I was testing myself to see if I had
any limits. Apparently, I don't.

437
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:24,055
Look, you can adjust to these abilities.
You've gotta give yourself some time.

438
00:36:25,197 --> 00:36:27,188
How do you know, Clark?

439
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,498
I'm just saying give yourself some time.

440
00:36:30,669 --> 00:36:34,605
Oh, so in time, my parents
won't be scared of me.

441
00:36:35,574 --> 00:36:38,441
The girl of my dreams
won't think I'm a freak.

442
00:36:39,011 --> 00:36:41,343
-The cops won't be after me.
-I can help!

443
00:36:41,514 --> 00:36:43,277
I don't want your help, Clark.

444
00:36:52,491 --> 00:36:55,756
Treat me like a criminal. I'll give
them something to be scared about.

445
00:36:55,928 --> 00:36:57,225
It's not the answer.

446
00:36:58,697 --> 00:37:00,289
Come on, Clark.

447
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:02,627
If you had this power, what would you do?

448
00:37:02,801 --> 00:37:06,100
-I'd stop people like you.
-Nothing on this earth can stop me.

449
00:37:16,982 --> 00:37:18,506
You're wrong.

450
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,519
We'll see about that.

451
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:51,811
Eric.

452
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:55,116
I'm so cold.

453
00:37:56,956 --> 00:37:58,651
So cold.

454
00:38:09,602 --> 00:38:11,797
What do you think is
gonna happen to them now?

455
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:13,370
Not sure.

456
00:38:14,607 --> 00:38:18,703
Hey. They had problems
long before he had your abilities.

457
00:38:19,311 --> 00:38:20,471
How are you feeling?

458
00:38:21,247 --> 00:38:24,182
-Normal, for me.
-Clark.

459
00:38:25,784 --> 00:38:29,242
Your gifts are, well, they're a part of you,
but they don't define you.

460
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:31,613
I know.

461
00:38:32,157 --> 00:38:34,216
But they complicate all of our lives.

462
00:38:34,994 --> 00:38:37,394
Seeing how destructive Eric got....

463
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:42,000
That just reminds me
of how special you really are.

464
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,667
That's because Eric didn't get
my two strongest gifts.

465
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:52,004
You and Mom.

466
00:38:57,316 --> 00:38:58,578
Let's go home.

467
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:01,779
Hello, Dad, how's business?

468
00:39:02,288 --> 00:39:06,156
<i>Tomorrow's Planet is announcing
our takeover of Sir Harry's company.</i>

469
00:39:07,026 --> 00:39:09,961
<i>-Did I merit a mention?
-Third paragraph.</i>

470
00:39:10,829 --> 00:39:13,627
<i>That's what happens
when you trust your family, Lex.</i>

471
00:39:14,233 --> 00:39:15,461
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

472
00:39:16,035 --> 00:39:19,903
Thanks, Dad. That means
a lot coming from you.

473
00:39:22,608 --> 00:39:25,941
Your so-called experts
were wrong about Clark Kent.

474
00:39:26,645 --> 00:39:28,977
I saw it with my own eyes.
He's just a regular kid.

475
00:39:29,148 --> 00:39:30,274
That's not possible.

476
00:39:32,184 --> 00:39:35,449
-So how do you explain the accident?
-I can't...

477
00:39:35,621 --> 00:39:38,021
...but I'm closing the book
and putting it behind me.

478
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,317
-There's something there, Lex.
-I don't care.

479
00:39:40,492 --> 00:39:43,757
The Kents are off-limits, understand?

480
00:39:45,998 --> 00:39:47,966
You have something for me?

481
00:39:59,278 --> 00:40:01,007
Nice picture quality.

482
00:40:02,147 --> 00:40:05,947
-Who initiated this little encounter?
-Who do you think?

483
00:40:06,585 --> 00:40:09,816
-Victoria?
-Your father.

484
00:40:32,311 --> 00:40:34,802
Hey. I was just locking up.

485
00:40:36,348 --> 00:40:38,475
I brought your necklace back.

486
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,719
This is beautiful. Where'd you get it?

487
00:40:46,024 --> 00:40:47,286
A friend.

488
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,860
It's made of lead armor.

489
00:40:51,997 --> 00:40:53,658
I want you to have it.

490
00:40:53,832 --> 00:40:56,494
I figure, that way
it can protect your memories.

491
00:41:06,178 --> 00:41:09,079
Is this your way of telling me
I shouldn't wear my necklace?

492
00:41:10,015 --> 00:41:12,347
I don't want it to hold you back.

493
00:41:15,788 --> 00:41:19,053
Sometimes letting go
is the only way to move forward.

494
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:30,628
You okay?

495
00:41:30,803 --> 00:41:34,603
You look like you've got the weight
of the world on your shoulders again.

496
00:41:34,773 --> 00:41:36,468
Yeah, I guess I do.

497
00:41:38,744 --> 00:41:40,336
Can I walk you home?

498
00:41:41,313 --> 00:41:44,180
Actually, I'm meeting Whitney at the store.

499
00:41:45,684 --> 00:41:46,776
Rain check?

500
00:41:48,954 --> 00:41:50,444
Rain check.

501
00:41:52,825 --> 00:41:54,349
Good night, Lana.

502
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:56,726
Good night.

503
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,749
[ENGLISH]
