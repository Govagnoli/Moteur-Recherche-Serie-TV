1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,240
So how'd you get out of gym class?

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,440
Spared the sweats for a couple of days,
the perk of chairing the blood drive.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,680
I'm sorry. Aren't you the girl
who skinned her knee in 7th grade...

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,920
...and passed out
when she saw the blood?

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,360
I was hoping
I'd live that down, but yeah.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,560
Clark, you're gonna be late.
We gotta hit the showers.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,920
- Bye, Lana.
- Bye.

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,680
- Troy, give it back!
- Amy, just hang on.

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,320
Just want to see if you wrote
anything about me.

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,240
Jeff, you know your sister's writing
psycho love letters to Lex Luthor?

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,840
- It's always the quiet ones.
- Give it back to her.

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,400
It's not my fault
you've got a weirdo for a sister.

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,000
You're a child, Troy.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,960
It's because of boys like you
that girls want a man like Lex Luthor.

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,800
Keep dreaming, Amy.
Your parents clean his bathrooms.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,680
You may live there,
but Luthor won't slum it with the help.

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,520
Just leave her alone.

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,240
What are you gonna do about it?

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,920
Losers.

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,120
So when are you donating blood?

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,880
I don't know.

22
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,640
Come on. Selflessly giving of yourself
to save others, girls love that.

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,520
You okay?

24
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,840
Yeah, I'm fine.

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,000
Very funny, guys.

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,000
Stop it!

27
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,600
Troy, you okay?

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,000
What happened?

29
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,840
It attacked me.

30
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,200
It was like a ghost.

31
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,760
Shimmer

32
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,160
So you didn't see anything?

33
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,720
When I got there,
Troy was already on the floor.

34
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,920
What about the voice he heard?

35
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,440
Are you thinking
the locker room's haunted?

36
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,960
Not unless the meteor rocks conjure up
ghosts of departed jockstraps...

37
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,240
...which I seriously doubt.

38
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,000
Thank you. Well, it's nice
to see you still have your standards.

39
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,360
I don't have time right now.

40
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,000
If you don't want to help me
with this blood drive, then just say so.

41
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,320
- That's not it.
- That doesn't look pretty.

42
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,800
Then what is it?

43
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,080
I really don't wanna talk
about this now, okay?

44
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,000
No, it's not okay.
You have been avoiding me for a week.

45
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,320
Every time I ask you what's wrong,
you push me away.

46
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,760
I'm worried about you.

47
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,960
Don't be.

48
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,120
I just need some space.

49
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,880
If that's what you want, fine.
But if you can't even confide in me...

50
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,000
...I don't know why we're going out
in the first place.

51
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,720
Quick, pretend we weren't watching.

52
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,520
Hey, Lana, how's it going?

53
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,880
Not great, but thanks
for the courtesy clueless.

54
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,880
Would it cheer you up if we offered
to volunteer a pint tomorrow?

55
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,000
Let's find out.
How about 9:45? That's open.

56
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,520
- Cool.
- There, better already.

57
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Clark, what time can we schedule you?

58
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,440
We didn't pick a time for you yet.
When can I put you down?

59
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,840
Actually, I'm not sure.

60
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,920
Can I get back to you?

61
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,440
Sure, not a problem.

62
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,240
Well, I mean, I figure I could help out.

63
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,240
Sign people up, pass out cookies.

64
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,240
That'd be great. Thanks.

65
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,720
Bye.

66
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
Okay, nice recovery.
But am I to assume...

67
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,440
...that your offer to help isn't completely
without an ulterior motive?

68
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,760
I'm just being a good friend.

69
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,280
Okay.

70
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,640
Yes, Daddy, we're on schedule.

71
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,680
Lex is playing hard to get...

72
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,640
...but I'm sure
I can make him come around.

73
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,560
Bye, Daddy.

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,160
He wants to know if you're selling
this castle after we sell out your father.

75
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,680
Why? Does he want to ship it
back over to Scotland?

76
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,120
Amy, where's your mom?

77
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,200
Flu, I think. She asked me
to cover for the afternoon.

78
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,800
Have you met Victoria?

79
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,160
- No, not officially.
- She's gonna be staying with us.

80
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,640
I am so sorry.

81
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,160
I'll go get something to clean this up.

82
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,440
She spilled that on purpose!

83
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,360
That was a mistake. Wasn't it, Amy?

84
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,200
Sure.

85
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,960
She's clearly got a thing for you, Lex.

86
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
Never took you for the jealous type.

87
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,880
Her parents are a fixture.
I brought them here from Metropolis.

88
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,280
Then send them back.

89
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,720
Were you just in the house?

90
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,400
Amy.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,400
Amy, I asked you a question.

92
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,120
- What's going on?
- Your sister was bothering Mr. Luthor.

93
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,600
If anyone is bothering him,
it's that tramp.

94
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,200
She's ruining everything.
She wants him all to herself.

95
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,200
We may live on the Luthor estate,
but we're not part of that world.

96
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,080
You have to know your place.

97
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,080
Both of you.

98
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,720
Don't worry, Mom.
We know exactly what our place is.

99
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,760
Thanks, Jeff.

100
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,800
Just be careful.

101
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,000
Clark, what's this?

102
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,880
Blood drive at school.
Lana's running it.

103
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,920
- Clark, you know you can't donate.
- I know, Dad.

104
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,120
What do I tell her?

105
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,200
That you have a problem with needles,
which you technically do.

106
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,720
Great. Not only do I lie,
but I look like a wuss.

107
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,800
I can't even believe
I'm actually gonna say this...

108
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,760
...but I guess you can't always
be honest with people.

109
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,120
It's one of the prices you pay
for your abilities.

110
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,520
That's why I volunteered.

111
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm sure it had nothing to do
with the fact that Lana is running it.

112
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,720
- Whitney dropped out.
- So you thought you'd move in.

113
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,560
If he doesn't see how great she is,
then he doesn't deserve her.

114
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,240
Looking for something?

115
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,360
My watch.

116
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,160
- Tulips look great.
- Yeah, you cleaned us out.

117
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,200
Mom said if you want some more,
you have to call Holland.

118
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,200
They're Victoria's favourite.

119
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,200
What was that?

120
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,960
You and Victoria
must be getting pretty close.

121
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,480
You seem surprised.

122
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,960
She just doesn't seem like your type.

123
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,240
Relationships aren't always
about love, Clark.

124
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,440
Sometimes they're about mutual goals.
Not every girl is Lana Lang.

125
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,960
Sorry, it's none of my business, really.

126
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,800
It's okay. I admire your standards.

127
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,760
Don't lose that.

128
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,280
I decided to fight for Lana.

129
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,960
Good for you.

130
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,320
Why the new attitude?

131
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,760
I decided to take the advice of a friend.

132
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,320
Don't you have another watch?

133
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
I've got hundreds.

134
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,480
This one's special. My mother gave it
to me right before she died.

135
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,720
I don't see it.

136
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,240
What are you, part bloodhound?

137
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,320
No, I live on a farm.

138
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,360
I'm pretty good at finding needles
in haystacks.

139
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,480
How about I go check the library?

140
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,880
- What's going on?
- Wait here.

141
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,920
Doesn't leave much room
for interpretation.

142
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,240
It was pretty weird.

143
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,040
I mean, the door was shaking.

144
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,480
When we got close, it blew open.

145
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,120
Lex said he felt
something brush past him.

146
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,000
Maybe the Scottish castle
came complete with a poltergeist.

147
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,560
The police say it's vandals.

148
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,520
They don't know many ghosts who write
in spray paint and own a black light.

149
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,440
So how's the blood drive?

150
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,960
Lana and I are getting together tonight.

151
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,880
- At her place?
- Yeah.

152
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,680
That's very romantic.

153
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,440
Just remember, Clark,
once you cross that line...

154
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
...you can't hide behind the cloak
of friendship anymore.

155
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
Proceed with caution.

156
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,320
Lex...

157
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,080
...you have disappointed me.

158
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,880
Hi, Dad. It's good to see you too.

159
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,080
Would you mind telling me
what she's doing here?

160
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,120
Right now? Working on my neck.

161
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,920
But knowing her,
I think that's just a start.

162
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,600
Could this be a ploy to get my attention?

163
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,400
Well done. It worked.

164
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,880
This will come as a shock...

165
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,520
...but not everything in my life
revolves around you.

166
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,000
I understand.
So you're simply being swindled.

167
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,240
Would you excuse us, Miss Hardwick?

168
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,040
My son and I are gonna have
a little chat about family loyalty.

169
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,960
It's all right.

170
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,760
I'll run us a bath.

171
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,080
I'll be there shortly.

172
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,800
I'll send Sir Harry your regards.

173
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,120
Swell.

174
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,000
This is hardly business.

175
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Generations of Luthors
would beg to differ.

176
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,120
It's always business, especially
where the Hardwicks are concerned.

177
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,440
Lex, can't you see
she was sent to distract you?

178
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,080
Sir Harry has been nipping away
at LuthorCorp for months.

179
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
LuthorCorp is your company.

180
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,880
I'm just one of its
many expendable employees...

181
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,720
...as you made abundantly clear when
you exiled me to this cow town.

182
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,520
Empires are not brought down
by outside forces.

183
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,800
They are destroyed
by weaknesses from within!

184
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,720
Lex, I've told you this...

185
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,040
...Smallville is your test.
Right now, you're failing.

186
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,400
Thanks for the update,
but I know what I'm doing.

187
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,920
No, you don't.

188
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,040
She is playing the only card she's got...

189
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,720
...and you are falling for it
hook, line and sinker.

190
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,000
My personal life is my business.

191
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,680
Not when it affects my company.
Then it's my business.

192
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,880
Listen to this.

193
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,360
If you sell out your family,
then you will truly be alone in the world.

194
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,160
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

195
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
You don't deserve him.

196
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,920
- Amy, hey, what's wrong?
- Her. What do you think?

197
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,320
Amy?

198
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,800
I've got an opening at 5.

199
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,840
I can shift mine to 4:30 at Station B.

200
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,440
- Which makes us...
- Done.

201
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,480
You're kidding. Everything?

202
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
We own this town.

203
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,440
We never found a time
for you to donate.

204
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,080
Actually, Lana,
I have a confession to make.

205
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,200
I've got this thing about needles.

206
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,600
It's kind of embarrassing.

207
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,520
Don't worry about it.
Your secret's safe with me.

208
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,640
You are such a lifesaver, Clark.

209
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,160
It's amazing you do
all these different things.

210
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,120
Trying to find my place in the world.

211
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,760
Can't thank you enough.

212
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,360
It's a great cause. How can I not help?

213
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,400
Ask Whitney. He's...

214
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,280
I don't know where he's been lately.

215
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,640
You know, Lana,
if you really want to thank me...

216
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,920
...don't talk about Whitney.

217
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,320
Fair enough.

218
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,560
Did you ever think it's strange that
my dad and your aunt used to date?

219
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,320
Nell doesn't really talk about it much.

220
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,880
Whatever happened,
I guess she took it kind of hard.

221
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,640
I'm just glad that you and I are so close.

222
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,680
Me too.

223
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,240
That's the thing about Clark Kent.

224
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,920
He's not always there
when you want him...

225
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,440
...but he's always there
when you need him.

226
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,680
It's a fine distinction.

227
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,680
You're the one who's helping me
with the pledge drive.

228
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,640
I am.

229
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,920
You're the one who listens.

230
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,160
I do.

231
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,960
You're the one who's here.

232
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,200
Yeah.

233
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,000
Lana, you still at it?

234
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,040
Clark, do you have the time?

235
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,160
No, but I'm guessing it's late.

236
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,360
Smart kid.

237
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,000
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

238
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Have you ever seen
the sunset from my loft?

239
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,760
Yes.

240
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,600
But that's the great thing about sunsets.
They're unique.

241
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,600
You always see things
you've never noticed before.

242
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,800
You want to come over tomorrow?

243
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,200
I'd love to.

244
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,280
Good night, Clark.

245
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,000
"Have you seen the sunset
from my loft?"

246
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,400
You actually said that?

247
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,960
And I bet your stomach
was in knots the whole time?

248
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,360
If I were you, I'd start scripting
what I was going to say now.

249
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,320
No, I think I'll play it by ear,
fly by the seat of my pants.

250
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,640
Clark, you're not the flying type.

251
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,640
I'll make you some notes.

252
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,480
Whitney, your mother called,
and she filled me in.

253
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,680
She shouldn't have.

254
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,920
Well, Whitney, she was just concerned.

255
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,360
Look, I'm not here to push.

256
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,760
If you need anything,
my office is just down the hall.

257
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,800
Okay?

258
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,760
Okay.

259
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,840
Sorry.

260
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,560
You're welcome.

261
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,680
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Amy.

262
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,520
Is everything okay?

263
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,880
Yeah, just...

264
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,280
...you know, all the weirdness
at the mansion.

265
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,880
Everything was fine
until Victoria got there.

266
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,360
Well, you're Lex's friend.
What do you think of her?

267
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,720
I really don't know her that well.

268
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,200
Well, I think I figured out
why she's sticking around.

269
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,400
I saw her in Lex's bedroom
going through his things.

270
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,400
What were you doing in Lex's bedroom?

271
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,400
Helping my mom.

272
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,040
- And Victoria didn't see you?
- No.

273
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,320
See, Lex is the only one
who ever treated me like I was there.

274
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,200
What brings you over so late?

275
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,920
- Doing a little ghost-hunting?
- No.

276
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,480
I came here to talk to you about Victoria.

277
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,840
Where is she?

278
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,280
She's taking a bath. Why?
Is there a problem?

279
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,400
Last night when I was in here,
I saw her...

280
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,560
I really don't know how to say this.

281
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,120
She was going through the files
on my computer?

282
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,520
Yeah, how'd you know?

283
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,160
Very little happens in this house
without my knowledge.

284
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,240
You don't seem very upset about this.

285
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,680
We're playing chess, Clark.
It's a game.

286
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,040
Like I said, we've known
each other a long time.

287
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,480
Well, you don't love her.
She goes behind your back.

288
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,920
- Why do you want to keep her around?
- It's complicated.

289
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,600
Thanks for the heads up.

290
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,040
That's what friends are for.

291
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,360
I guess I shouldn't even bring up
that Amy's got an obsession with you.

292
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,480
It's a teenage crush, nothing more.

293
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,720
Hey, how goes your new Lana initiative?

294
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,560
I found something out about Whitney.

295
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,280
I saw a prescription in his bag
for Amlodipine. It's a...

296
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,760
Heart medication.

297
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,240
My mother was on it
before she had her surgery.

298
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,800
Is that what...?

299
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,160
I'm sorry.

300
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,320
She was sick for a long time, Clark.

301
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,040
The watch I lost...

302
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,880
...my mom gave it to me
when she knew it was getting close.

303
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,960
She found a Napoleon franc from 1806
and had it made into the face.

304
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,640
Why Napoleon?

305
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,520
You ever see the painting
of Napoleon 's Coronation by David?

306
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,120
No.

307
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,760
Napoleon's mother couldn't make it
to his coronation.

308
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,680
But when he commissioned it...

309
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,160
...Napoleon told David to paint her in
as if she were there...

310
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,120
...right in the center.

311
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,040
Even though she couldn't
be there physically...

312
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,960
...he brought her into his life
through sheer force of will.

313
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,720
There to share in his greatness.

314
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
It's a good story.

315
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,560
It's a good watch.

316
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,120
Lex?

317
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,760
You're gonna be okay.

318
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,480
It's definitely blood.

319
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,080
Doesn't exactly fit the Casper paradigm.

320
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,160
Which means that whoever attacked
you and Victoria in the bathroom...

321
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,960
...was invisible?

322
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,440
What's this green stuff?

323
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,040
It smells like roses.

324
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,640
What happened?

325
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,120
I just touched it.

326
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,720
Okay, I'm now officially weirded out.

327
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,160
What is this?

328
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,680
If you rubbed that all over your body,
you'd be...

329
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,080
Naked?

330
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,040
You'd be invisible.

331
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,680
So, what's our next move?
Should we call the police?

332
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,040
And report an invisible person?

333
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,960
We need a viable suspect.

334
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,800
Well, who's got a problem
with Lex's British fling?

335
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,000
Amy Palmer.

336
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,120
Her parents are on the mansion's
house staff.

337
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,840
Amy said she saw Victoria
snooping in Lex's bedroom.

338
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,240
- She said Victoria didn't see her.
- No wonder.

339
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,840
- Wait. Didn't Amy give blood?
- 3:45, Station B.

340
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,640
You've got a freakishly good memory.

341
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,320
Okay, I'll get the blood type
on the broken piece of glass...

342
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,360
...and check it against Amy's.

343
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,520
- Call me later?
- Top of my speed-dial.

344
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,040
Whatever it is, I'm not interested.

345
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,840
What about Lana?
You interested in her?

346
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,640
What is it
with you and my girlfriend, Kent?

347
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,120
Nothing.

348
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,720
We're just friends.

349
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,920
- Think I don't see how you look at her?
- At least I pay attention.

350
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,120
You've got an unbelievable girlfriend,
and you don't even know it.

351
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,840
- What's your problem?
- How I deal with my girl is my business.

352
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,720
Okay?

353
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,040
I saw the heart medication in your bag.

354
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,480
What's going on, Whitney?

355
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,840
It's my dad.

356
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,360
He's been in Metropolis all week,
you know, for tests.

357
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,840
Is he gonna be okay?

358
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,720
Doctors don't know.

359
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,920
You haven't told Lana yet, have you?

360
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,400
She's been through enough pain
in her life with her parents.

361
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,760
I didn't want her to go
through it with me.

362
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,160
I don't think you give her
enough credit.

363
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,520
She's strong.

364
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,080
She'd probably understand
better than anyone.

365
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,600
Hey, how's Victoria?

366
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,200
She's resting up in Metropolis for a few
days until I can get some answers.

367
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,000
Everything okay?

368
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,520
You ever gotten information
you wish you hadn't?

369
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,040
In my experience, there's no such thing
as too much information.

370
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,280
I assume you're talking
about the quarterback?

371
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,240
His father's sick.

372
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,320
That's too bad.

373
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,920
I wanted to take my shot
with Lana, but now...

374
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,960
You feel like you'd be taking advantage.

375
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,720
- What would you do?
- Who, me? I'd go for it.

376
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,600
See, but that's what I like about
you, Clark. You wouldn't.

377
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,800
Hi, Lex.

378
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,840
Amy, this is a surprise.

379
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:42,240
Well, I just saw your car outside,
so I thought I'd come in and say hi.

380
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,720
Well, I appreciate the gesture.

381
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,720
So now that Miss Hardwick's gone,
hopefully things will be back to normal.

382
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,600
Victoria will be back in a few days.

383
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,520
She's really not as bad as you think.

384
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,000
I never thought that.

385
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
Well, bye.

386
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,200
What is it?

387
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,240
I don't know what to say, Mr. Luthor.

388
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,520
Amy's been having trouble in school...

389
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,640
...but I can't imagine
she'd try to hurt Miss Hardwick.

390
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,160
I hope I'm wrong.

391
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,760
Looks like she's been collecting you.

392
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,840
My watch.

393
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,800
We had no idea, Mr. Luthor.

394
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,680
Please don't call the police.

395
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:07,600
I'm not interested in retribution
or publicity, but Amy needs help.

396
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,440
Counselling, medical treatment,
whatever it takes, just send me the bill.

397
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,800
Even so, I think it'd be best for everyone
if you left the mansion tonight.

398
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,800
Yes, of course.

399
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,480
You made it.

400
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,680
Sorry I'm late.

401
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,040
It's just getting to the good part.

402
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,320
What do you think?

403
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,440
I think it's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

404
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,800
The other night on the porch, I felt
you were trying to tell me something.

405
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,480
I was.

406
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,720
But Nell's timing was impeccable,
as always.

407
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,360
She's not here now.

408
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,760
What I wanted to tell you was...

409
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,160
What I wanted to say was...

410
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,600
...I would never do anything to hurt you.

411
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,080
I know that.

412
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,720
But if I said what I really wanted
to say right now, that's what I'd do.

413
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,000
I'd hurt you.

414
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,000
Why don't you take a shot?

415
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,120
I'm pretty strong.

416
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,040
I know, but I think Whitney
needs to know that too.

417
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,680
I thought you didn't want
to talk about Whitney.

418
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,040
I don't.

419
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,200
But if you were my girlfriend
standing in Whitney's loft...

420
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,720
...I'd hope he'd say the same thing.

421
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,560
I understand you're mad at him...

422
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,000
...but you need to talk to him. He needs
you right now. He just doesn't know it.

423
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,520
Clark, why are you doing this?

424
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,040
Because after all this time...

425
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,760
...you and I are finally friends,
and I don't wanna lose that.

426
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,400
Look.

427
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,640
We missed it.

428
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,360
I just wanted to feel close to you.

429
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,720
Jeff is gonna pack everything else.

430
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,840
My husband will be back
in the morning to pick it up.

431
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,640
- Again, Mr. Luthor, l...
- It's okay. It's okay.

432
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Drive safely.

433
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,160
Yes, I'd like to leave a message
for Victoria Hardwick.

434
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,240
Who's there?

435
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,680
Come out and show yourself.

436
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,360
How'd it go with Lana?

437
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,760
We're still friends.

438
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,320
- Are you okay with that?
- No.

439
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,880
But I think it's the right call for now.

440
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,120
Hello?

441
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,240
Hey, Mrs. Kent.

442
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,520
Hi, Chloe. Well, I'll see you later.

443
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,040
Okay, so, bad news
on the Dracula front.

444
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,160
The drop of blood
on the mirror was type A.

445
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,560
Amy Palmer was type O.

446
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,320
But she had a shrine
to Lex in her room.

447
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,240
She may be Lex-obsessed, but she's not
the one that tried to off Victoria.

448
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,080
Check the paper.

449
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,200
Amy's blood type doesn't match,
but look at Jeff's.

450
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,880
Her brother?
He's always been so quiet.

451
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,000
Practically invisible.

452
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,680
I'll catch up with you later.

453
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:09,280
Don't you understand? She loved you.

454
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,080
How could you send her away?

455
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,360
- Who are you?
- Suddenly, you care.

456
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,000
Master Lex with his castle,
his plant, his expensive cars.

457
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,320
When did people ever matter to you?

458
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,280
Jeff?

459
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,080
Where are you?

460
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,840
Servants are supposed to be invisible.

461
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,080
We tried to hide,
fade into the woodwork.

462
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,840
My parents lived with it, pretended
it didn't matter, but Amy wanted more.

463
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,720
And I'm through pretending!

464
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,320
What have I ever done to you?

465
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:02,720
- You threw her out like she was nothing.
- I thought she was attacking Victoria.

466
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,160
That was me.
I wanted to scare her. Make her leave.

467
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,440
I wanted everything back
to the way it was for Amy...

468
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,680
...but you're not interested in love.
- That kind of love could get me arrested.

469
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,320
She's a little young for me, Jeff.

470
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,520
You ruined her life!

471
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,680
Our lives!

472
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,520
I'm not gonna let you hurt her again!

473
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,760
Lex! It's me. Open up!

474
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,440
Stay away from him, Kent.

475
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,960
This is your fault too.

476
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,120
Jeff, what happened?

477
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,440
Chemistry, Kent.

478
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,720
Some plants don't absorb light,
they refract it.

479
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,040
I found a weird green rose
on the grounds, and I studied it.

480
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,560
And then I used the oils
to become what I've always been...

481
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,560
...to Lex, to the people at school...

482
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,080
...everyone.

483
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,000
Like you're something special.

484
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,360
Well, I'm special too.

485
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,280
What do you think's
gonna happen to Jeff?

486
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,760
A lot of serious therapy.

487
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,440
The bigger question is
how he made himself invisible.

488
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,960
I don't know. I guess
the secret's gonna stay with him.

489
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,640
- How's your head?
- I've survived worse.

490
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,400
Can't say the same about
my father's antique collection.

491
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,160
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

492
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,320
My mother always hated that room.

493
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,400
"War's in our nature," she said.
"We don't need to put it on display."
