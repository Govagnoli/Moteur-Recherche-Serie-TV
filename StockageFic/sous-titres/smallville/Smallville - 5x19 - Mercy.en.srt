1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,750
Yes. Yes, yes, I realize that your division
has been trying very hard...

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,356
...but unfortunately,
this isn't grammar school.

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,035
Efforts don't count.
You only get an A for results.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,272
Yeah, well, you know, if...
If I give you more time...

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,955
...that will continue to reflect negatively
on Luthorcorp's balance sheets.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,193
So l... I wish you and your people
much success...

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,476
...with a less demanding company.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,790
Yeah, well, thank you.

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,674
<i>Hello, Lionel.</i>

10
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,399
Alex, what are you doing?

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,718
<i>Sorry, Alex is a little busy right now.</i>

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,474
What the hell are you doing?
Who are you?

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,077
<i>You're used to being in control.</i>

14
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,959
<i>If you wanna regain it,</i>
<i>you're gonna have to play a little game.</i>

15
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,830
<i>The 11:35 from Smallville to Metropolis</i>
<i>is running on time.</i>

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,151
<i>Win the game, or you'll be</i>
<i>catching a ride the hard way.</i>

17
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,312
- What game?
- <i>Hangman.</i>

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,438
<i>Call out a letter. Guess the phrase.</i>

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,512
<i>Lose the game, your life follows.</i>

20
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,275
<i>Hurry, Lionel.</i>
<i>You only get an A for results.</i>

21
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,874
- A.
- <i>Too obvious.</i>

22
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,553
E.

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,758
- O.
- <i>Lucky guess.</i>

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,797
- T.
- <i>Wrong again.</i>

25
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,993
- G.
- <i>Sorry.</i>

26
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,513
- S.
- <i>Nope.</i>

27
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,518
<i>Would you like a hint?</i>

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,274
<i>It's a lesson I learned from you.</i>

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,593
M.

30
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,988
C.

31
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,593
R, Y, N.

32
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,433
No mercy!
The answer is "no mercy."

33
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,799
Lionel's at my house constantly,
acting like he belongs there.

34
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,394
From what you're telling me,
it sounds like your mom...

35
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,630
...kind of invited the wolf
to come on in.

36
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,711
We've tiptoed through these
tulips before.

37
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,110
What if you're wrong?
What if Lionel doesn't know?

38
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,113
The things he says to me,
the look in his eye. Chloe, he knows.

39
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,238
Well, then he's probably using your mom
to get closer to you.

40
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,233
He's always there, helping her,
offering advice.

41
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,833
She's trusting him more and more.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,911
And she wouldn't
if she knew the truth.

43
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,917
I know I need to tell her.
I was going to after I found out.

44
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,958
- So, what stopped you?
- She's been through so much.

45
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,351
Since my dad died, I just...

46
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,034
I didn't wanna give her
one more thing to worry about.

47
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,192
Well, by not telling her, you could
be putting her at risk of a lot worse.

48
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,438
Chess?

49
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,750
You haven't played chess in years.

50
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,071
Why the sudden interest
in such a complex game?

51
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,674
A friend of mine
wants to learn the finer points.

52
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,071
I used to dismantle
your two-dimensional assaults...

53
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,515
...with alarming regularity, remember?

54
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,753
Maybe you should teach your friend
something less complicated.

55
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,388
What about a game of hangman?
That's always fun.

56
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,393
Thanks.

57
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,913
I'll stick with chess.

58
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,036
And you'll lose, as always.

59
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,711
I'm not playing to win.

60
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,313
I'm playing to instruct.

61
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,391
No mercy?

62
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,673
- What are you talking about?
- It was you, Lex.

63
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,114
- I know it.
- What?

64
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,078
Disabling my limo
in the path of an oncoming train.

65
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,959
That kind of melodrama
went out of style with silent movies.

66
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,037
Wait, someone tried to kill you?

67
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,792
Is this the part
where you feign innocence?

68
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,349
I brought you in
to help run LuthorCorp again.

69
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,478
Profits have never been higher.
Why would I want you dead?

70
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,110
Not so long ago, I tried
to take LuthorCorp away from you.

71
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,077
- The Apex takeover.
- Right.

72
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,153
Please. Seeing you fail miserably
was retribution enough.

73
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,954
All right.

74
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,998
All right.

75
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,438
So it wasn't you.

76
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,555
I may not like you very much, Dad...

77
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,676
<i>...but</i> you're a valuable asset
to LuthorCorp.

78
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,592
Killing you would hurt the bottom line.

79
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,796
Your concern is truly touching.

80
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,351
I am concerned.

81
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,314
A threat against you
is a threat against LuthorCorp.

82
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,234
I have been fending off attacks
on my life since before you were born.

83
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,994
I think I can handle one more.

84
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,316
Oh, Clark. What do you think
about this as a closing?

85
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,677
"It isn't enough
to simply give when we can.

86
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,310
Upholding the principles of truth, justice
and the American way...

87
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,109
...isn't a matter of convenience.
It's a matter of conscience."

88
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,032
Sounds like words to live by.

89
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,839
Let's hope the deep pockets
at the fundraiser think so too.

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,274
I need to talk to you.

91
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,908
Can't it wait until tomorrow?
I gotta get to Metropolis.

92
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,633
Lionel knows.

93
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,794
Knows what?

94
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,431
Lionel knows about me.

95
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,234
About my secret.

96
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,792
- I don't know how.
- I think I might.

97
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,832
A while ago...

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,195
...I found
a package on our doorstep.

99
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,399
Inside was a video of you
surviving an explosion.

100
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,756
- Who sent it?
- I'm not <i>sure...</i>

101
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,592
...but Lionel took care of it.

102
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,032
He said he wasn't interested
in why I was being blackmailed.

103
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,270
He just wanted to help.

104
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,474
And I believed him.

105
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,995
Why didn't you tell me about this?

106
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,470
You were still in so much pain
about your father.

107
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,552
I guess l...

108
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,871
I just wanted
to protect you for a change.

109
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,191
Lionel's gonna be
at this fundraiser tonight.

110
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,715
- When I see him...
- No, you can't say anything.

111
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,677
We have to handle this
the way Dad would.

112
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,796
Stick to our routine.
Give nothing away.

113
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,632
Not until we know
what Lionel's up to.

114
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,993
I better get going.

115
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,792
- I'll go with you.
- No, no.

116
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,714
If you start guarding me all the time,
he'll definitely know something's up.

117
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,359
Don't worry.

118
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,590
I can handle Lionel.

119
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,079
Bye.

120
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,270
Well, there are no concealed electronic
devices here in the office anywhere, sir.

121
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,714
Office is clean.

122
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,359
I hope so, for your sake.

123
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,829
Or you'll find yourself working
in a convenience store...

124
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,356
...watching hot dogs spin. Thank you.

125
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,240
<i>Watching hot dogs spin?</i>

126
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,913
<i>That wasn 't very nice.</i>

127
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,074
<i>But that's the way you treat</i>
<i>the people who work for you...</i>

128
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,958
<i>... isn 't it, Lionel?</i>

129
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,398
What do you do, read lips?

130
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,869
<i>I see everything.</i>

131
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,477
<i>911.</i>

132
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,598
<i>Hello, Lionel.</i>
<i>How does it feel to be helpless?</i>

133
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,398
I'll let you know if it ever happens.

134
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,355
<i>Now, that's that winning spirit</i>
<i>that made you a billionaire.</i>

135
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,511
<i>Let's see if it can keep you alive.</i>

136
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,032
So...

137
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,598
...what do you want, huh?

138
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,032
<i>I want to play another game.</i>

139
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,838
<i>Hello again, Lionel.</i>

140
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,434
Where am I?

141
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,637
<i>In a hell of your own making.</i>

142
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,349
Who are you?

143
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,670
<i>Just another one of the many</i>
<i>faceless people...</i>

144
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,432
<i>... your greed has destroyed.</i>

145
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,795
That narrows it down some,
doesn't it?

146
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,916
<i>You may not know me, Lionel...</i>

147
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,399
<i>... but I know you.</i>

148
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,074
<i>You're a man above it all...</i>

149
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,279
<i>... commanding your workers</i>
<i>to carry the burden of your empire.</i>

150
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,237
<i>They toil while you profit.</i>

151
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,073
It's called running a business.

152
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,992
That's how it works!

153
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,513
<i>Not anymore.</i>

154
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,195
<i>Now you're gonna have to get</i>
<i>your own hands dirty.</i>

155
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,672
<i>Bright, isn 't it?</i>

156
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,712
<i>Yeah.</i>

157
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,672
<i>Oh, well now, what do we have here?</i>

158
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,512
<i>Take a closer look.</i>

159
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,632
<i>Go on.</i>

160
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,359
<i>Not exactly spring water, is it?</i>

161
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,110
<i>A good story always needs a hook.</i>

162
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,918
<i>Wouldn 't you agree?</i>

163
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,435
All right. So, what happens now?

164
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,956
<i>Now we're gonna play another game.</i>

165
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,838
<i>Would you like to see how it's played?</i>

166
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,877
Yeah, show me.

167
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,351
<i>These are the scales of justice.</i>

168
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,719
<i>Fill the buckets</i>
<i>with the liquid from the tap...</i>

169
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,718
<i>... and balance them on the pole.</i>

170
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,714
<i>Succeed, and the door</i>
<i>to this room will open.</i>

171
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,114
<i>Alex...</i>

172
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,236
<i>... he didn 't do too well.</i>

173
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,558
<i>Did I forget to mention</i>
<i>the liquid is highly flammable?</i>

174
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,552
He was my driver, an innocent man.

175
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,792
<i>No one connected to you is innocent.</i>

176
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,151
- <i>Ready to play?</i>
- No.

177
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,630
No, Lionel Luthor
doesn't jump through hoops.

178
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,430
<i>In 10 minutes, flames beneath your feet</i>
<i>will consume this room.</i>

179
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,598
<i>Balance the scales...</i>

180
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,990
<i>... or burn for your sins.</i>

181
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,957
Take your time.

182
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,431
The key to mastering chess
is to anticipate your opponent's <i>moves...</i>

183
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,431
...and keep him on the defensive.

184
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,591
Lex, what are we doing?

185
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,878
I thought we were enjoying
an evening of chess.

186
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,794
I think I have Monopoly here.

187
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,598
You know what I'm talking about.

188
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,720
We've spent the last week
avoiding what happened.

189
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,073
I was kind of waiting for you
to bring that up.

190
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,352
You kissed me.

191
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,357
And then you kissed me back.

192
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,437
God, after all that talk about friendship
and not wanting to ruin what we have...

193
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,592
<i>...we</i> really don't listen very well,
do we?

194
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,997
Are you asking me
to forget what happened?

195
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,916
Because short of
a serious blow to the head...

196
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,755
<i>...I</i> think it's a memory
that's gonna linger for quite a while.

197
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,038
You should get that.
I'm gonna go back to Metropolis.

198
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,156
I'll call you later.

199
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,238
What?

200
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,149
Get a security team
and meet me at LuthorCorp Plaza.

201
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,470
And keep this internal.

202
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,473
I don't want anyone to know
my father's missing.

203
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,195
<i>Getting a little warm?</i>

204
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,271
<i>How does it feel?</i>

205
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,319
<i>The flames licking at your heels.</i>
<i>Every step, blistering pain.</i>

206
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,511
<i>I bet a pair of those thousand-dollar</i>
<i>Italian shoes you favor...</i>

207
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,877
<i>... would really make a difference</i>
<i>right about now, wouldn 't they?</i>

208
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,390
<i>I understand how hard</i>
<i>it must be for a man...</i>

209
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,869
<i>... who 's not used</i>
<i>to breaking a sweat.</i>

210
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,998
I grew up in Suicide Slums.

211
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,549
Sweat's something
I'm very familiar with, my friend.

212
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,678
<i>I know all about</i>
<i>your underprivileged youth.</i>

213
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,435
<i>But that all changed when your</i>
<i>parents died in the fire you set.</i>

214
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,511
<i>Oh, did I hit a nerve?</i>

215
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,511
I didn't kill my parents.

216
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,478
<i>Tell a lie long enough,</i>
<i>you'll believe it to be truth.</i>

217
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,519
<i>You're running out of time.</i>

218
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,838
<i>You wanna tell me</i>
<i>what you've learned...</i>

219
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,709
<i>... from this little game before the flesh</i>
<i>is seared from your bones?</i>

220
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,633
Yeah, you talk too much.

221
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,792
Shut up.

222
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,032
<i>Careful, careful.</i>

223
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,229
<i>Remember what happened</i>
<i>to your limo driver.</i>

224
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,439
<i>The scales of justice are hard to balance</i>
<i>with blood on your hands...</i>

225
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,556
<i>... aren 't they?</i>

226
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,077
<i>Congratulations on your acquittal.</i>

227
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,072
<i>Lionel?</i>

228
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,632
- What? Another game?
- <i>Yes.</i>

229
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,514
<i>But for this one,</i>
<i>you're gonna need a partner.</i>

230
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,831
<i>Someone to help you</i>
<i>through the dark times.</i>

231
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,554
Martha.

232
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,474
<i>Lionel!</i>

233
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,914
<i>Lionel!</i>

234
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,398
Lionel, please!

235
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,357
Don't... Don't...

236
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,750
Don't... Don't panic.

237
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,750
- Martha?
- Lionel! What's...? What's going on?

238
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,990
Someone is playing a very sick game.

239
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,071
- Who?
- I don't know. How did you get here?

240
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,073
I don't know! I was
in the parking structure at the Plaza...

241
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,071
...and l... I heard this noise behind me.

242
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,232
I don't know. Just please get me out!

243
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,754
All right. All right. Martha, stand back.

244
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,152
All right!

245
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,991
All right! She's got nothing
to do with this. Let her go!

246
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,230
<i>She has everything to do with this.</i>

247
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,996
<i>You use your wealth to buy influence,</i>
<i>controlling the halls of power.</i>

248
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,152
<i>You're the man in the shadows,</i>
<i>pulling all the strings.</i>

249
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,279
<i>And your puppets...</i>

250
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,476
<i>... they're as guilty as their master.</i>

251
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,870
<i>And they deserve a similar fate.</i>

252
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,475
All right. All right. So, what's this game?
How do I get her out, huh?

253
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,915
<i>You use words as weapons.</i>

254
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,593
<i>Twisting them to your purpose.</i>

255
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,990
<i>Obscuring truth with double meaning.</i>

256
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,878
<i>Now it's my turn.</i>

257
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,472
"A toad like fever."
I don't understand this!

258
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,716
<i>Shift your perceptions.</i>

259
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,033
- Shift your...
- <i>Her life is in your hands.</i>

260
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,192
No, wait! Wait! I need more! L...

261
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,190
I understand the whole
acting-normal thing...

262
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,794
...but ferreting out the truth
is acting normal for me.

263
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,713
- Chloe...
- You're not the only one Lionel's playing.

264
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,155
He fed me information
about Fine being in Honduras...

265
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,231
...because he knew
I'd come to you with it.

266
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,472
Why don't you let me use that as an in
to find out what he's up to.

267
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,234
What if he finds out what you're up to?
It's too risky.

268
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,631
Oh, and waiting for Darth Luthor
to hatch his evil plan isn't?

269
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,074
Hey, Lois.

270
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,390
No, she left hours ago.

271
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,592
- I'll let you know if I hear anything.
- What is it?

272
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,911
My mom never showed up
at the fundraiser in Metropolis.

273
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,317
Oh, my God.

274
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,314
Pull the security vids
for the last 24 hours.

275
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,038
See if you can find
anything else unusual.

276
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,519
Yes, sir.

277
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,434
It's okay.

278
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,830
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for your father.

279
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,070
- Where is he?
- I wish I knew.

280
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,958
He's missed meetings
and never showed up...

281
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,076
...for a fundraiser at the Plaza.

282
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,114
Neither did my mother.

283
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,718
Lex, if you have any idea what's
going on, you better tell me now.

284
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,516
Clark, earlier today,
my father accused me...

285
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,148
...of orchestrating
some bizarre attempt on his life.

286
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,117
Think someone's giving it
a second shot?

287
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,396
All I know is that he was taken
from this office.

288
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,834
How do you know that?

289
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,036
I found his cell phone on the floor.

290
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,794
Last call he tried to make was to 911.

291
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,559
Time stamp on it matches an unexplained
gap in the building's security tapes.

292
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,672
What about the cameras in here?

293
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,274
There aren't any.

294
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,637
My father liked to have a place where
he could conduct certain transactions...

295
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,032
...without any electronic records.
- Would that be the less-than-legal kind?

296
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,154
Lex?

297
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,550
Has this always been chipped
liked that?

298
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,796
My father wouldn't tolerate
a flaw in his prized collection.

299
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,592
Nice catch.

300
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,752
This isn't your standard issue.

301
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,878
This was homemade by somebody
who really knew what they were doing.

302
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,837
High res. Wireless carrier.

303
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,673
- Is it transmitting?
- No, it's powered down.

304
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,276
But if we juice it up, I might be able
to trace where it's located.

305
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,038
Let's try it.

306
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,952
"A toad like fever!"

307
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,588
Fever? It doesn't...
It doesn't make any sense.

308
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,876
It has to mean something!

309
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,837
- Have you ever heard it before?
- No.

310
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,718
Wait! Why aren't they all the same?

311
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,791
The first letters of the words.

312
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,598
The T and the F are capitals.

313
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,069
But not the A in the beginning
and the L in "like"!

314
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,276
T, F, right, right.
He said it was a... What?

315
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,318
He said, "Shift... Shift...
Shift your perception."

316
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,471
It... It... It's an anagram.

317
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,074
It's an anagram!
The w... The true meaning is scrambled.

318
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,073
- It's a word puzzle!
- A word puzzle.

319
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,192
It's transmitting on a rotational code.

320
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,432
I'll see if I can hack the sequence
and locate the termination point.

321
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,033
Hurry.

322
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,599
It's a shame, isn't it?

323
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,638
It takes a crisis like this to get us
in the same room together.

324
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,354
Look, Clark, maybe when
this is all over, we can...

325
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,670
...try to find our way back
to some common ground.

326
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,119
Excuse me. I need to take this.

327
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,515
Is there anything I can do
to make this go faster?

328
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,955
Not unless computer skills
are one of your abilities.

329
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,590
The signal's strong. Minimal degradation,
which means it must be local.

330
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,314
Got it. 8320 Vermont Avenue.
Five miles from here.

331
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,754
Great.

332
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,592
You find something?

333
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,759
An address not far from here.

334
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,957
Great. We'll take my Porsche.
It's a lot faster than your truck.

335
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,034
Let's go.

336
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,712
V-l-L. "Evil."

337
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,552
"To dare fake evil."

338
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,994
It's gibberish. It's...

339
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,957
There's meaning in it!
There has to be!

340
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,678
No, there's...

341
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,798
You want me to fail, don't you?
You want me to watch her die?

342
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,871
- Is that what you want?
- Lionel!

343
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,076
He wants me to fail.

344
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,831
Fail, fail, fail.

345
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,914
Fail, all right. He said:

346
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,548
"The truth is obscured
with double meaning. " Double.

347
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,597
It's double meaning. No mercy.

348
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,712
Greed, grab, take.

349
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,713
Take, take, take. To take.

350
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,836
Over. Takeover!

351
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,515
Failed takeover! Failed takeover!
The answer is "failed takeover"!

352
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,193
Failed takeover!

353
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,157
Apex. Apex!

354
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,072
Apex!

355
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,952
It's Apex.

356
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,839
Martha?

357
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,638
Martha.

358
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,592
Martha.

359
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,037
You're all right.

360
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,918
It's all right.

361
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,993
<i>Genuine concern</i>
<i>for another human being?</i>

362
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,438
<i>I suspected your relationship with</i>
<i>the senator was more than just political.</i>

363
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,152
All right.

364
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,799
All right.

365
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,439
All right, we won your game.
Now let us out.

366
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,874
<i>As you wish.</i>

367
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,834
Come on, Martha.

368
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,831
Wait, wait! Wait!

369
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,594
- What's...? What's up here?
- <i>Freedom.</i>

370
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,713
<i>Or death, depending on the outcome</i>
<i>of your final game.</i>

371
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,235
You expect us to walk
right into another trap?

372
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,790
<i>You could stay right where you are</i>
<i>and wait for the floor to be electrified.</i>

373
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,673
Come on.

374
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,311
- What happens now?
- I don't know.

375
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,994
No! No!

376
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,711
I'm sorry that you got dragged
into this.

377
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,791
Dragged into what? Who is that man?

378
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,394
- I don't know.
- Apex? A failed takeover.

379
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,836
- What does that mean?
- Apex Group was an Asian consortium...

380
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,719
...I used to try to take back control
of LuthorCorp from Lex.

381
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,791
Lex found out...

382
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,191
...and made a very compelling
argument for me to pull out.

383
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,271
Apex funded hundreds of companies.

384
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,034
The investors were ruined.
A lot of people lost everything.

385
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,158
- Because of you. Because of your greed.
- No, this wasn't about me.

386
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,118
- This was about Lex.
- Lex?

387
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,439
About hurting him?

388
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,353
- You hate him that much?
- I was trying to teach him, Martha.

389
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,909
- Lessons. Hard lessons. I thought that if...
- Oh, God!

390
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,958
If I removed the temptations
that power and money gave him...

391
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,873
...maybe then he would be able
to rediscover his own humanity.

392
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,113
Did you ever think of just talking to him?
Father to son?

393
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,509
That might work in the Kent family.
But Lex is not Clark and...

394
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,717
I'm not the father
Jonathan Kent was.

395
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,318
It's never too late to change.

396
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,235
<i>Unless you're dead.</i>

397
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,832
<i>Lionel Luthor, you've destroyed</i>
<i>so many lives without consideration...</i>

398
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,353
<i>... all to win your own games.</i>

399
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,312
<i>Let's see if you can do the same...</i>

400
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,156
<i>... when the life in the balance is</i>
<i>someone you so obviously care about.</i>

401
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,472
<i>One bullet.</i>

402
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,949
<i>Kill Senator Kent, win your freedom.</i>

403
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,912
<i>Or if she kills you, winner goes free.</i>

404
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,798
No.

405
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,038
We're not playing any more games.

406
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,273
<i>There's an explosive charge attached</i>
<i>to the elevator cable above your head.</i>

407
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,319
<i>If one of you isn 't dead...</i>

408
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,951
<i>... you both lose.</i>

409
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,117
<i>Your decision.</i>

410
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,754
Clark, how close are you?

411
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,672
We're in the building.

412
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,550
I think we found it. Hold on.

413
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,996
- You wanna wait for the security team?
- No.

414
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,832
Me neither.

415
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,917
- Chloe, there's no one here.
- They must've rerouted the <i>signal...</i>

416
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,197
...in case we found the camera.
- Clark.

417
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,033
Mom.

418
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,913
I'm sorry, Martha.

419
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,752
Please forgive me.

420
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,116
Only one of us
is gonna walk out of here.

421
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,714
- Lionel...
- No, don't talk.

422
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,479
You take it.

423
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,270
You're good, Martha.

424
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,670
So many people depend on you.

425
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,239
Especially Clark.

426
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,955
And we both know that he...

427
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,877
What a special boy he is.

428
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,951
And now, because Jonathan's <i>gone...</i>

429
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,315
<i>...he's</i> gonna need you
more than ever.

430
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,436
To become the man this...

431
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,273
...world so desperately needs.

432
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,478
Do it.

433
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,392
And go home to your son.

434
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,637
I can't. I can't.

435
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,156
I'd hoped that...

436
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,072
I'd <i>always...</i>

437
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,109
...hoped that things would end
differently with us, Martha.

438
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,190
Don't blame yourself.

439
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,228
- Your life is truly important.
- No!

440
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,157
Chloe? What happened?

441
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,038
<i>The feed was terminated</i>
<i>at the source.</i>

442
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,599
I'm trying to trace the location.

443
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,274
The signal's all over the place,
trying to throw us off.

444
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,638
<i>A selfless act from Lionel Luthor.</i>

445
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,792
<i>Life is full of surprises.</i>

446
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,674
<i>So is death.</i>

447
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,993
- Son of a...
<i>- I got it!</i>

448
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,071
<i>- They're somewhere across town.</i>
- Where?

449
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,593
It's gonna take a minute
to narrow it down.

450
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,751
Okay, start heading west.
I'll guide you in.

451
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,831
Pull the security detail...

452
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,238
Clark, we should...

453
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,118
<i>There's no escaping, Lionel.</i>

454
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,191
<i>The charges have been primed.</i>

455
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,078
<i>One more touch of a button...</i>

456
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,357
<i>... and the LuthorCorp empire</i>
<i>mourns its founder.</i>

457
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,909
You were never
gonna let us go, were you?

458
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,798
<i>You're the master manipulator, Lionel.</i>

459
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,030
<i>You should know</i>
<i>that some games are rigged.</i>

460
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,273
Why didn't you just kill me?

461
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,194
<i>Because I wanted</i>
<i>to watch you suffer like I did.</i>

462
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,593
You. You're the... The...

463
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,514
Yeah, I stood right in front of you today.
You didn't even know who I was.

464
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,714
You didn't see the house I lost.

465
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,628
Wife. Children.

466
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,509
An entire life gone
because of your little game with Apex.

467
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,358
I'm no one.

468
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,672
Just another piece of Lionel Luthor's
collateral damage.

469
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,037
This is between me...

470
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,838
...and you.

471
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,514
Let her go.

472
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,191
Does it hurt, Lionel?

473
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,032
Knowing you're gonna watch her die?

474
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,311
The one person you would have
sacrificed your life for.

475
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,752
Let her go.

476
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,358
This is my fault.

477
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,598
All of it.

478
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,235
I'm sorry.

479
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,240
That's all I wanted to hear.

480
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,878
That was...

481
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,511
...miraculous.

482
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,033
Thank you...

483
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,879
...son.

484
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,473
- Oh, sweetie, thank you.
- Yeah.

485
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,477
You're sure you're okay?

486
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,998
I got some bumps and bruises,
but l... I'll live.

487
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,079
No thanks to Lionel.

488
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,553
What happened...

489
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,759
...was the work of a very disturbed man.
Lionel's no <i>saint...</i>

490
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,433
<i>...but</i> this wasn't his fault.

491
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,473
Maybe not directly.

492
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,276
He was willing to sacrifice himself.

493
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,308
For your future.

494
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,389
Lionel never does anything
that doesn't benefit him in the end.

495
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,639
We can't trust him.

496
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,789
If we wanna protect your secret,
we might not have a choice.

497
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,997
Lincoln Kole.

498
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,510
That was the name
of the man who did all this.

499
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,595
- You found him?
- In a bar around the block.

500
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,999
He was toasting your demise.

501
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,598
Didn't care if he was caught,
as long as you were dead.

502
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,592
The authorities had to sedate him
when he found out you weren't.

503
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,116
Powerful men, son.
We attract the occasional lunatic.

504
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,514
It wasn't insanity that drove him
to that, Dad. It was you.

505
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,037
We all make mistakes, son.

506
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,192
And yours almost cost
Martha Kent her life.

507
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,953
Well, I'm just <i>thankful...</i>

508
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,476
<i>...the</i> elevator's safety brakes slowed us
down enough to survive the fall.

509
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,119
Yeah.

510
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,033
You should be.

511
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,156
Especially since Kole disabled them.

512
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,428
That's enough to make
a man believe in miracles.

513
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,353
Isn't it, son?

514
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:56,553
I don't suppose clark had anything to do
with that divine intervention.

515
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,158
Clark?

516
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,914
I heard what you said over the video.

517
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,230
About what a special boy he is.

518
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,879
What'd you mean by that?

519
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,470
I meant that...

520
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,956
<i>...he's</i> the kind of son
a father could be proud of.

521
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,629
One minute he's standing
in the same room with me...

522
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,113
<i>...and</i> the next he's across town.

523
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,030
You're still obsessing over him
after all these years?

524
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,111
Clark Kent's a simple farm boy.

525
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,633
Let it go, Lex.

526
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,272
Let it go.

527
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,270
I've been expecting you, Kal-EI.

528
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,479
How long have you known?

529
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,870
From the moment I held
in my hand the crystal...

530
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,634
...that helped to form
your Fortress of Solitude.

531
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,798
The one that put you in a coma?

532
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,958
Coma?

533
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,988
I'd like to think of it as a...

534
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,634
A state of...

535
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,272
...contemplative repose.

536
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,671
You've known my secret
for almost a year.

537
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,909
Yes.

538
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,513
Why haven't you done anything?

539
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,753
What? Expose you to the world,
some strange visitor from another planet?

540
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,878
I've tried to tell you,
I am not your enemy.

541
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,314
To reveal your secret...

542
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,153
...would change your destiny.

543
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,429
And it would harm someone
I care about very deeply.

544
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,712
You had a choice...

545
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,556
...to kill my mother or to kill yourself.

546
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,314
I could never harm your mother.
There was no choice.

547
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,913
Yeah?

548
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,237
Unless you knew the gun
wasn't loaded.

549
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,356
You have no reason
to believe anything I say.

550
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,794
I realize that.

551
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,952
But I hope eventually,
you will come to trust me.

552
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,319
I only want what's best
for you and your mother...

553
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,277
...son.

554
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,710
You don't call me that.

555
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,111
Jonathan Kent was my father.

556
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,116
- No, I'm not trying to take his place.
- You couldn't.

557
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,437
My mother seems to think
there may be some good in you.

558
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,391
But I'm not so sure.

559
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,836
It takes time, Clark.
Maybe you will be.

560
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,235
Or maybe you'll just
show your true colors.

561
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,275
Secret or no secret...

562
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,832
...you stay away from my mother.

563
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,593
Or you'll wish I never saved your life.

564
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,311
