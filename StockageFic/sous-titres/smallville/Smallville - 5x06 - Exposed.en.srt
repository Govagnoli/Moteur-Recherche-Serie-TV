1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,477
<i>Daily Planet</i> info line.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,598
Obituaries?
Yeah, sure, let me transfer...

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,876
Oh, dog obituaries.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,713
Oh, I'm sorry.
We don't actually run those.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,991
Yeah, okay. You're welcome.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,276
Die! Die!

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,829
Lois, I'm sorry you were in
for a girls' night <i>out...</i>

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,310
...and I got called in to screen news
that's not fit to print.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,550
Compared to the Kent farm,
this is a rager.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,436
Besides,
I wouldn't pass up an <i>opportunity...</i>

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,592
...to watch a big-shot reporter
in action.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,236
All right,
now that I'm swimming in <i>butter...</i>

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,472
...why are you really here obliterating
aliens with me at 1 a. M?

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,312
I'm racking up brownie points.

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,278
I need you to help me move out
of the Kents' next weekend.

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,032
You took the apartment
at the Talon?

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,239
- How are you gonna live without Clark?
- One word: Blissfully.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,311
How you had a crush on
Richie Cunningham...

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,754
...I will never understand.

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,957
You gotta come back to Smallville.
It'll be fun. I'll buy pizza.

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,599
You don't need to Tom Sawyer me.

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,957
We're family.
Just tell me when to be there.

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,511
- <i>Daily Planet</i> info line.
- I need a reporter to meet me.

24
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,792
Who is this?

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,634
<i>I wanna talk to a reporter.</i>

26
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,714
You have to send someone fast,
before he finds me.

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,714
Seventh and Edgemont.
Please, you've gotta hurry.

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,918
We couldn't have met
at a coffee shop?

29
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,356
I don't think she was looking
for a brunch date, Lois.

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,909
Sounds like a story
someone didn't want her to tell.

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,071
I thought you were
supposed to pass leads...

32
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,276
<i>...to</i> someone who's cubicle
is above ground.

33
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,637
Well, unless I wanna stay subterranean,
I've gotta take a chance.

34
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,870
Please! Help me!

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,314
- There she is.
- Help!

36
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,678
Over here!

37
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,351
She's dead.

38
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,399
So how much longer do I have you
before you hightail it back to Metropolis?

39
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,790
Well, Lana's gone for the weekend.

40
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,030
I lost out to a comet
her class is tracking...

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,270
...at the Lincoln Observatory.

42
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,516
How about Chloe or Lois?

43
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,114
Well, chloe's juggling classes
and the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

44
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,874
And Lois... I'd do anything
to get rid of Lois.

45
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,838
I don't think that's exactly a prereq
for best-friend status.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,433
Well...

47
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,078
Hold this.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,513
Dad.

49
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,199
Is that the best you got?

50
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,909
I had another six inches out here.

51
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,359
I wasn't sure how rusty
your reflexes had gotten.

52
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,831
Senator Jennings.

53
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,113
I know it's been a long time,
but what happened to "Uncle Jack"?

54
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,272
For someone who's on
a first-name basis with the governor?

55
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,830
I don't remember the governor
winning a state football championship.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,513
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

57
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,830
Anybody push you
to follow in his footsteps?

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,390
Hey, it's a lot better than spending
the games underneath the bleachers...

59
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,437
<i>...with</i> the sheriff's daughters.

60
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,636
Not both of them at once.

61
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,757
Since when do you trek out here
in the middle of a campaign?

62
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,353
Exactly why I came.

63
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,750
I needed a breather from the rat race.

64
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,151
Besides, I could use your help
rallying the farmers.

65
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,038
You got a lot of pull
with that union.

66
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,795
Why? You always win this county
by a landslide.

67
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,554
Well,
the race is about to get a lot tougher.

68
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,195
Rumor has it I'm running against
Lex Luthor.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,912
Let me get this straight.
No ID or make on the vehicle...

70
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,914
...no ID on the driver,
and no clue why this girl called.

71
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,755
I'd say you're off to a great start
as an investigative reporter, Ms. Sullivan.

72
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,674
If you remember anything else,
let me know.

73
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,355
I think that's code for,
"We're gonna file this under the rug."

74
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,228
This is a big city,
and bad things happen.

75
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,915
A pretty young girl, not in college,
with no traceable job...

76
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,277
<i>...in</i> that part of town. It's not a mystery
what happened down there.

77
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,912
You don't think it's strange
that an alleged streetwalker...

78
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,310
...was wearing
$500 Jimmy Choo shoes?

79
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,110
Look, Detective Sawyer,
this girl died trying to tell me her story.

80
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,034
Now, I'm sorry I'm not street-hardened,
but she's more than a statistic to me.

81
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,270
We have to find out who did this.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,718
I applaud your spirit, girls.

83
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,395
But you should know that most of those
streets turn out to be dead ends.

84
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,677
I will do my job, you do yours.

85
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,673
Hopefully you'll have more luck
than Officer Stalin.

86
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,956
I ran the number
that Melissa girl called from.

87
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,156
It was from a payphone near
where we saw her.

88
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,914
But the only addresses
within 10 blocks from the place...

89
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,638
...was a bunch of warehouses.

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,753
And a club called the Windgate.

91
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,554
I'm guessing she didn't get
all glammed up to count inventory.

92
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,595
So your dad outran four cop cars...

93
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,274
...and pissed off half the farmers
in Chickasaw County.

94
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,193
It's only because you said
that you knew a shortcut.

95
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,555
These aren't the sides
of the story that I hear.

96
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,234
Got any more? They're useful
when I'm in for a lecture.

97
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,277
No, I don't think...

98
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,716
Hang on. Don't you say anything else.
Just a second.

99
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,397
Maggie Sawyer,
Metropolis P.D.

100
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,834
- Hi.
- May I come in?

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,515
- Yeah, sure, come on in.
- Thank you.

102
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,992
Senator.

103
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,993
Campaign headquarters said
I could find you here.

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,672
What can I do for you?

105
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,434
A young woman was killed last night.
Hit and run.

106
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,353
We went through her apartment,
and we found this.

107
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,839
Now, I don't have enough evidence
to bring you in...

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,831
...but I would appreciate
an explanation.

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,629
So would I.
I never seen her before.

110
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,029
Well, that must have been tricky
while she was cuddled up on your lap.

111
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,040
With all due respect, senator,
pictures don't lie.

112
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,398
Hang on just a minute.
This day and age, they most certainly do.

113
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,309
This picture's a fake.

114
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,909
Doesn't matter.

115
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,390
The minute it hits the press,
the damage is done.

116
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,879
This could ruin me.

117
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,154
So it looks like the mudslinging's
already started.

118
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,952
Dad, do you really think
Lex would go this far?

119
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,555
Come on, Clark,
you know Lex better than anybody.

120
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,359
He's not gonna enter a race
unless he's sure he's gonna win.

121
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,998
Is it true, Lex?

122
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,196
You know,
after you've been MIA for <i>weeks...</i>

123
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,238
<i>...I</i> don't think a hello
is too much to ask for.

124
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,474
How long you been planning
to run for state senate?

125
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,629
Several months now.

126
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,711
If you're implying
I should've told <i>you...</i>

127
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,872
...you might rethink the barrier
you've drawn in this friendship.

128
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,358
I can't believe you'd destroy someone
just to win a race.

129
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,034
There's a reason they call it a "race,"
not a "political potluck."

130
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,549
But if you think
I had something to do with this...

131
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,950
Your competition was linked
to a murder...

132
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,031
...just before you announce
your candidacy.

133
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,754
It's a bit of a coincidence.

134
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,038
You don't recognize that picture?

135
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,760
The only thing I recognize
is the booth.

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,672
It's the Windgate Gentleman's club.

137
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,559
Not a smart stop-off
for an incumbent on the campaign trail.

138
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,996
I know this guy. If you're not trying
to set him up, somebody is.

139
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,673
Maybe it's somebody at this club.

140
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,196
Clark, there's a reason
that club's so underground.

141
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,797
The city doesn't exactly give licenses
for some of the things that go on there.

142
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,395
Are you sure
you wanna get involved in this?

143
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,670
Jack's like an uncle to me.

144
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,840
And in case you've forgotten,
that's what friends do.

145
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,715
Look, if you're serious
about getting through that front door...

146
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,076
...you're gonna need a little more
than your driver's license.

147
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,794
Do me a favor.
Stay out of trouble.

148
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,074
I guess even MapQuest
has its limitations.

149
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,470
Do you get to this place
through a manhole cover?

150
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,915
Or a big neon door.

151
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,311
I'd say the Armani suit's
a dead giveaway.

152
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,749
Baby.

153
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,237
Hi!

154
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,509
Sorry, girls.

155
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,592
- Our friend's already in there.
- It's her only night in town.

156
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,274
I promised I'd take her to
the hottest address. Please?

157
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,793
It's a private club.

158
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,838
I'm afraid this is as much of the place
as you're going to see.

159
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,192
I don't like that. That <i>is...</i>

160
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,999
This makes my Halloween
Heidi dirndl costume look tame.

161
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,670
You think that Melissa girl
was a dancer here?

162
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,114
I don't know.

163
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,478
Jimmy Choos are a long way
from angel wings and fishnets.

164
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,438
Excuse me. Hi.

165
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,354
Do you guys know anything
about a woman named Melissa Page?

166
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,233
People won't talk,
but records definitely will.

167
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,073
If she worked here, she'll be on file.

168
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,879
Joel, David, come on up.

169
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,629
- Are you ladies lost?
- We were just looking for...

170
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,037
Oh, don't be shy.
She's here to dance.

171
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,597
Are you the replacement
Rocco sent over?

172
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,957
Yeah, he really hated to see her go.

173
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,837
Take your clothes off.
Let's see what you got.

174
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,278
- I knocked. I guess you didn't hear.
- Oh, I heard you.

175
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,953
I'm here to see Senator Jennings.

176
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,599
Lex, if you wanna sling mud...

177
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,593
...I strongly recommend you do it
at somebody else's house.

178
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,638
Don't worry,
I'm not holding my breath for your vote.

179
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,508
You know, I've never liked you
all that much, Lex...

180
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,797
<i>...but</i> even I'm surprised by the depths
you're willing to sink to.

181
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,793
I'm sure you have such a good view
of it all from your pulpit.

182
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,597
Holier-than-thou is an easy fallback.

183
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,069
Keeps you from really looking
at people around you.

184
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,559
I've known Jack for 25 years.

185
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,995
I've never had a more
trustworthy or loyal friend.

186
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,196
This state needs somebody like him.

187
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,430
Somebody who's willing
to stand by their word.

188
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,239
Somebody who's willing
to do what's right for <i>everybody...</i>

189
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,913
...not just for himself.

190
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,400
Somebody who's willing
to go up against people like you.

191
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,989
Well, if you know him so well...

192
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,550
...maybe you should ask
your good old boy to explain this to you.

193
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,034
After clark's <i>visit...</i>

194
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,590
<i>...I</i> decided to look into the senator's
unfortunate snapshot myself.

195
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,352
It's his cell-phone record.

196
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,875
Seems he's been calling his
dead stripper friend...

197
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,678
...a little more than frequently.

198
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,396
When are you releasing this?

199
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,437
I'm not.

200
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,036
But if I found it, you know the press
won't be far behind.

201
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,512
I thought he'd like a heads-up.

202
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,673
Lois, are you almost done?

203
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,671
You didn't have that much to put on.

204
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,592
Remind me when all this is over...

205
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,671
...to never, ever
ask a favor of you again.

206
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,479
This isn't just about me.
This is about getting the truth.

207
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,551
Well, the last girl
that knew the truth...

208
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,995
...ended up as a hood ornament
on someone's car.

209
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,118
Howdy.

210
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,233
You know, my friend's really excited
about working here...

211
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,039
<i>...but</i> I think it's kind of dangerous.

212
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,988
Especially after that girl
was killed and everything.

213
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,996
How can I explain this to you?

214
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,392
Don't talk to me.
Don't talk to any of us.

215
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,753
Well?

216
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,278
What do you think?

217
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,834
All I can say is...

218
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,039
...God bless America.

219
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,351
Good evening.
First time at the Windgate?

220
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,033
Yeah, Lex Luthor referred me.

221
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,551
Will Mr. Luthor be joining you
this evening?

222
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,313
No.

223
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,911
I'm meeting Jack Jennings.

224
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,878
The senator?
Let me show you to his usual table.

225
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,912
- On second thought, l...
- No, no, no.

226
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,911
Thinking bad, dancing good.

227
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,757
Just ask Mr. Shoot-First-Think-Later
over there.

228
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,555
Now, I need you to dig deep down
and find your inner Demi Moore.

229
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,398
- Okay?
- Okay.

230
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,037
You better at least use this distraction
to find something about Melissa.

231
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,794
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

232
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,235
You're welcome. Have a good evening.

233
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,278
Hey, handsome,
what can I get for you?

234
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,316
I'll have a coke.

235
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,234
Straight up, on the rocks.

236
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,152
<i>Gentlemen,</i>
<i>let's give Colette a nice</i> au revoir.

237
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,472
<i>And now, making her first</i>
<i>Windgate appearance...</i>

238
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,592
<i>... welcome to the stage...</i>

239
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,435
<i>... all-American girl Amber Waves.</i>

240
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,792
Bravo.

241
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,752
Bravo.

242
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,234
<i>I'd salute to that anytime.</i>

243
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,198
<i>Let's give it up</i>
<i>for our red-blooded recruit.</i>

244
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,954
<i>And now, let's give a good</i>
<i>homegrown welcome...</i>

245
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,359
<i>... to Dixie.</i>

246
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,073
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

247
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,438
It's chloe's fault.
We're following a murder story.

248
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,229
Well, that makes two of us.
But I think I'll stick to my method.

249
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,835
You're gonna get me fired if you keep
looking at me like I'm Jabba the Hutt.

250
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,672
What do you want me to do?

251
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,909
I don't know.
Give me a 20 and meet me out back.

252
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,671
Bravo. That new girl, who is she?
I want her.

253
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,796
<i>I don 't know, she's new.</i>

254
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,838
<i>For 500K, you know</i>
<i>I don 't ask any questions of my girls.</i>

255
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,798
<i>And for that much</i>
<i>you better not answer any, either.</i>

256
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,238
Everybody, freeze!

257
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,551
Metropolis P.D.
Everybody, take it easy.

258
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,599
We have a report of minors working
and being served in this establishment.

259
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,591
We'll be interviewing you
individually.

260
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,433
- Come on.
- What?

261
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,479
Do you want to stick around
and get arrested? Come on.

262
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,113
Really wrong time
and really wrong place, kid.

263
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,236
You're under arrest.

264
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,075
What is this about?

265
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,629
We had a tip that a car
involved in a hit-and-run...

266
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,552
...was seen leaving
your establishment.

267
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,359
- You can't just arrest...
- The city's looked the other way.

268
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,431
Your clientele can pull a lot of strings.

269
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,717
Now I've got a dead 19-year-old
on my hands. I gotta go by the book.

270
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,395
Okay, people, listen up.
I know that it's 5:00 in the morning.

271
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,949
Your cooperation would be
greatly appreciated.

272
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,838
Thank you.

273
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,632
All right, ladies.

274
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,639
- Clark?
- Chloe.

275
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,199
- Where's Lois?
- I don't know.

276
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,954
What are you...?
Clark, what are you doing here?

277
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,594
Clark!

278
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,310
What do you wanna know?
Maybe I can help you.

279
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,869
<i>You're the bouncer.</i>
<i>You know everything that goes on.</i>

280
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,951
- <i>Cut me a deal.</i>
<i>- Tell me about Jennings.</i>

281
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,678
<i>He was drunk. I took him home.</i>

282
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,230
<i>He had nothing to do with the girl.</i>
<i>He's innocent.</i>

283
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,989
Wow, these are...
They're heavier than they look.

284
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,557
They're way better than the heels,
trust me.

285
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,315
So you guys must have been
pretty close with Melissa, huh?

286
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,954
Sorry, okay. Premature segue.

287
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,236
Come on, we're obviously
on the same side here.

288
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,197
I just wanna know
what happened to her.

289
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,316
It's a tragedy is what it is.

290
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,596
She finally gets her shot
at Prince Charming...

291
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,398
...and, wham, bye-bye, ivory tower.

292
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,313
Are you talking about the senator?

293
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,677
No way. The only thing he did wrong
was fall for her.

294
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,070
There's this suave guy,
kind of Euro-Iooking.

295
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,515
- What'd he want with Melissa?
- Every few months...

296
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,114
...he picks some lucky girl
and takes her out of this dump.

297
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,352
Probably to some tropical island
somewhere.

298
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,669
You know why they invented fairy tales?

299
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,116
Because no one wants to face reality.

300
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,274
All we know is that the girls disappear,
and then no one ever sees them again.

301
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,710
Somebody should've warned your friend
about that.

302
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,074
- Lois?
- Yeah.

303
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,231
I saw her leave with him
during the raid.

304
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,112
Sullivan.

305
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,596
Let's go.

306
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,396
You can thank Lex Luthor
for some very generous phone calls.

307
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,597
Detective Sawyer, I think the guy
that killed Melissa Page has my cousin.

308
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,877
It's the same guy who made some deal
with the club owner before she vanished.

309
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,519
Do you know this guy's name?

310
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,638
Let me see if I'm understanding you.

311
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,791
Your cousin,
who I'm assuming is <i>underage...</i>

312
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,315
...was stripping and making deals
with wealthy patrons.

313
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,040
- Managed to escape a police raid...
- It's not like that.

314
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,839
- She was just helping me to investigate.
- Investigate?

315
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,475
Okay, Luthor may have pulled a
get-out-of-jail-free card for you this time...

316
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,358
...but it will not happen again.

317
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,556
If you wanna play
Nancy Drew and Hardy Boy...

318
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,870
<i>...do</i> it in someone else's precinct.

319
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,874
Look, if I don't change my stance
just because some poll tells me to...

320
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,112
...I am certainly not going to
because some journalist hears a rumor.

321
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,999
Okay, Jordan? Goodbye.

322
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,517
You just could not resist, could you?

323
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,750
You still have a nasty habit
of leaving your keys in the ignition.

324
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,274
Get in.

325
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,358
With you at the wheel?

326
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,035
I guess it wouldn't be the first time
I put my life in your hands.

327
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,152
What? Damn thing's been stuck
ever since I bought it.

328
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,113
Try that with a four-cylinder.

329
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,351
So, what's the real reason
for the joyride?

330
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,353
When were you gonna tell me
about the girl, Jack?

331
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,829
You think I had something to do
with what happened?

332
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,228
I have no idea.

333
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,994
But I do think it's time you gave me
some straight answers.

334
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,995
Look, I didn't want you to be involved.

335
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,628
There's only so much
you should ask of a friend.

336
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,075
- So instead you lie to my face...
- Well, what do you want me to say?

337
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,276
That my marriage is
more of a business arrangement?

338
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,552
And the only person who makes me
happy is some dancer half my age?

339
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,757
- How much of it do you understand?
- I might not understand any of it.

340
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,270
But come on, all of our lives
have taken turns that we didn't expect.

341
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,869
You've never had a lie get out of hand?

342
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,678
Or you've never been caught at it?

343
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,791
I've never been in a position
where people look up to me.

344
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,994
You are clark's hero.

345
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,795
Oh, so I'm not supposed to have
any faults, huh? Who can live up to that?

346
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,748
You know why there's no heroes today?

347
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,276
Because at the end of the day, people
don't respect them, they envy them.

348
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,716
- They're waiting for them to screw up.
- What are you gonna do, Jack?

349
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,750
What do you want me to do?
I'm a good senator.

350
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,309
You wanna give that kind of power
to somebody like Lex Luthor?

351
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,308
I might not agree with Lex Luthor's
politics, but at least I know who he is.

352
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,398
- Nice place you got.
- Thank you.

353
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,790
Well,
thanks for helping me out back there.

354
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,791
My pleasure.

355
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,669
I think I have something
a little more your size.

356
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,517
I won't peek. I promise.

357
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,398
Melissa.

358
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,550
You want me to help you tie it?

359
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,678
Oh, no, that's fine.

360
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,717
Almost got it.

361
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,831
What you doing there?

362
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:29,116
It looks so much better on you
than any of the others.

363
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,756
You're going to make them
very jealous.

364
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,392
You know,
I think I'm just gonna call a cab.

365
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,508
Think of your taxi days
as a thing of the past.

366
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,431
You have a whole new life
ahead of you now.

367
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,789
I don't know what kind of kink
you're into, but...

368
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,479
You are seriously behind
on your Gloria Steinem.

369
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,869
Yeah, that's fine.

370
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,112
The owner of the Windgate is selling
his strippers to the highest bidder?

371
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,874
It's Kansas, it's definitely not Smallville.

372
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,759
Five hundred grand
for a massage with benefits is a lot.

373
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,912
- Do you know anything else?
- The bouncer told Detective Sawyer...

374
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,275
...the guy was the son
of some foreign diplomat.

375
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,953
Then he'd have diplomatic plates.

376
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,839
See, while you were inside,
I was out in the parking lot...

377
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,434
...taking shots of the license plates
of all the cars.

378
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,238
- Here we go.
- Okay, check that one.

379
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,512
That's the U.N. Tower.

380
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,277
Lois?

381
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,631
- Chloe Sullivan.
- <i>He's got Lois.</i>

382
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,910
Any psychic guesses on this guy's
computer password?

383
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,954
God, don't even try. He's probably got
like a zillion layers of security on it.

384
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,031
It's still warm.
They must have just left.

385
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,549
- The printer's still on.
- Try pressing print again.

386
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,911
Chloe, it's a fake passport for Lois.

387
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,509
<i>Think they're gonna try to smuggle her</i>
<i>out of the country?</i>

388
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,831
Even if he does, I doubt he'll take her
through an airport.

389
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,992
Clark, there's a helipad on the roof.

390
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,954
We're stuck on something.

391
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,154
Hey, 007. Nice of you to show up.

392
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,230
I'll start assuming
that means thank you.

393
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,954
Looks like it got caught on the cable.

394
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,591
This scumbag
was about to air-cargo me...

395
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,035
...to the honeymoon suite
at the Grope-a-cabana.

396
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,716
I'm glad you're all right.

397
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,999
Now, if you will release him,
I'm afraid Mr. Lyon is free to go.

398
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,513
What?

399
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,551
You can't just let him walk away.

400
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,631
Diplomatic immunity.

401
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,075
As a consulate guest in our country...

402
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,438
<i>...Mr.</i> Lyon can't be arrested or tried
for any crime he commits on our soil.

403
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,317
Even murder.
I'm sorry, I can't touch him.

404
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,471
Well, I can.

405
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,112
Some people live above the rules.

406
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,475
Guess what. That's life in Metropolis.

407
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,312
You want justice...

408
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,948
...I suggest you stay
a little closer to home.

409
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,794
We'll finish this later.

410
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,871
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

411
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,790
I just wanna say thank you.

412
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,230
When I asked you to stay out of trouble,
I thought that might include...

413
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,834
...being caught at a strip club
using my membership...

414
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,797
...while I'm gearing up
for a campaign.

415
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,839
- I didn't mean to drag you into this.
- Come on, Clark, who you kidding?

416
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,834
You had me masterminding this plot
before you walked through those doors.

417
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,318
- I didn't think he was lying to me.
- But you assumed I would.

418
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,950
I can't believe that I looked up to Jack.

419
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,640
Tell me what you remember
about King David.

420
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,358
Humor me.

421
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,152
King David.

422
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,152
He slew Goliath, saved his people.

423
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,833
And afterward...

424
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,312
...he saw a beautiful woman bathing
and fell madly in love.

425
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,149
Problem was, she turned out to be
his best friend's wife.

426
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,828
So you know what our great hero did?

427
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,909
He sent his best friend off to die in battle
so he could have her to himself.

428
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,630
Kind of leave that part out, don't they?

429
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,672
We all need to believe in heroes, Clark.

430
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,749
And even the best ones
are far from perfect.

431
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,788
Surprised to see your car out front.

432
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,039
I thought you'd be gone
now that you're clear of murder.

433
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,873
I've been mulling over
some pretty tough decisions.

434
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,510
This seemed like a good place
to get my bearings again.

435
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,431
Have you talked to my dad yet?

436
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,955
I'd say he did most of the talking.

437
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,432
After 20 years, the man's still got a hell
of a knack for the guilt trip, doesn't he?

438
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,349
Usually works because he's right.

439
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,953
Your father's always had pretty high
expectations of the people around him.

440
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,236
He's the one man
I never wanted to disappoint.

441
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,998
You should try being his son.

442
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,829
The thing I always try to remember is,
no matter how much he lays on...

443
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,909
...he never expects
more than he expects of himself.

444
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,151
You think your dad
will ever forgive me?

445
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,869
Yeah, I've given him a lot of trial runs
in the forgiveness arena.

446
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,312
Look, I know my dad's friendship
means a lot to you...

447
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,355
<i>...but</i> there's a lot of other people
out there who look up to you.

448
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,872
I guess you can only pull off the disguise
of being superhuman for so long, huh?

449
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,913
What are you gonna do?

450
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,756
I've called a press conference.

451
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,194
I'm pulling out of the race.

452
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,037
Going back to the city, facing
all those reporters takes a lot of guts.

453
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,156
After facing you...

454
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,836
...live feeds and bloodthirsty journalists
are a walk in the park.

455
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,275
Look, if we let a couple of rough days
destroy over 25 years of friendship...

456
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,512
<i>...then</i> I guess we weren't
as good of friends as I thought we were.

457
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,471
Jack,
if you're pulling out of this <i>race...</i>

458
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,677
...because your old buddy
can't seem to climb off of his <i>pulpit...</i>

459
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,435
...that's not what I wanted.
All I really ask is that you be honest.

460
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,556
I'm pulling out of the race because
I'm no longer the best man for the job.

461
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,756
Are you sure?

462
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,798
If you wanna hang in there and fight,
I'll be behind you 100 percent.

463
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,519
I know.

464
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,555
But all those things you said
about me being loyal and trustworthy...

465
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,109
...and willing to take on
the Luthors of the world...

466
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,636
I might have been that man once,
but I have to step aside...

467
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,872
...when I see somebody
who still embodies all those qualities.

468
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,873
Jack, you can't seriously
be talking about Lex Luthor.

469
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,437
I'm talking about you, Jon.

470
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,552
Kansas could use a senator like you.

471
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,073
You should think about it.

472
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,754
Hey, Smallville.

473
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,195
Your personal space
is about to be reinstated.

474
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,112
What are you doing?
You just moved back in.

475
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,317
Well, now that Lana's living with chloe,
I'm taking the place.

476
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,031
You don't have a key to the apartment,
do you?

477
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,112
You know,
now that you two have been doing it.

478
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,838
- No, we...
- Good.

479
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,195
I wouldn't want
any surprise midnight visits.

480
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,195
Anything I can do
to make this move go faster?

481
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,839
Pack your three closets of clothing?

482
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,560
Burn your loofa? Take your
Whitesnake collection to Goodwill?

483
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,278
You can take this.

484
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,908
Come on, Smallville. Move it.

485
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,829
You know, this is weird.
I've spent so much time here with Lana.

486
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,514
Clark, it's not like I'm taking her place,
just her sublet.

487
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,911
Okay, before I start
any of the real heavy lifting...

488
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,355
...you have to indulge me
for just a moment...

489
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,910
...in my first <i>Daily Planet</i> byline.

490
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,758
It's not exactly the <i>Torch,</i> clark.
Page 73.

491
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,949
At the bottom.

492
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,311
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

493
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,278
Thanks, you deserve half the credit.

494
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,029
I'd still be playing point guard at the pet
obituary hotline if it weren't for you two.

495
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,549
Oh, it says here
Interpol was able to arrest him...

496
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,631
...due to an anonymous tip.

497
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,909
About that heavy lifting...

498
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,837
Clark?

499
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,150
Look, I'm not great at this, so just
keep your mouth shut and listen up.

500
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,949
Even though I was kicking butt
on the helicopter...

501
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,633
...it was nice to have backup.

502
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,792
And you didn't have to come after me,
but you always do.

503
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,191
So I wanted to say thank you.
You're a really good friend.

504
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,108
Oh, and about the lap dance?

505
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,874
If you decide to tell anybody about it...

506
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,589
...your Elmer Fudd night-light
will make a very public appearance.

507
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,831
Aye, aye...

508
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,398
...sailor.

509
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,751
