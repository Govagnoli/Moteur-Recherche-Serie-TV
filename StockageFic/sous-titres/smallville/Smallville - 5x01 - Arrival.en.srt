1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,798
<i>Previously on Smallville:</i>

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,712
Tell me what you've done.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,953
<i>I warned you that the elements</i>
<i>could not fall into the hands of a human.</i>

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,759
<i>The three must become one.</i>

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,637
In approximately three hours, a meteor
shower is predicted to hit Smallville.

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,914
And I want you to have this.
I somehow know that it's meant for you.

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,390
Your curiosity always has a way
of landing you in precarious positions.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,788
Where is it?

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,394
This is about you
getting your hands on that stone.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,232
I don't have the stone.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,713
<i>Who did this?</i>

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,871
<i>You know more</i>
<i>than you're telling me, Chloe.</i>

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,234
Now, who took the element?

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,119
You're talking like we're never
gonna see each other again.

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,713
I love you.

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,354
I love you too.

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,552
<i>And now, the season premiere</i>
<i>of</i> Smallville.

18
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,230
<i>Kal-EI, you have traveled far.</i>

19
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,110
<i>One journey has ended.</i>
<i>A new journey is about to begin.</i>

20
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,594
<i>Welcome home, my son.</i>

21
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,197
Please don't hurt me.

22
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,672
Lie down on the ground.

23
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,515
Open fire! Open fire!

24
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,596
Where's the girl?

25
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,918
She's irrelevant.

26
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,389
We must find Kal-EI.

27
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,111
Hush, Shelby.

28
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,510
- Oh, my God.
- Martha?

29
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,036
Martha? Sweetheart?

30
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,792
Martha?

31
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,234
Mr. Kent.

32
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,754
Are you okay? Mrs. Kent?

33
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,478
Clark?

34
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,513
Clark wasn't in here.
He's all right. Martha?

35
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,668
Mrs. Kent.

36
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,029
Martha?

37
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,593
Here! She's here.

38
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,192
Sweetheart.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

39
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,595
It's okay. Easy, easy.

40
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,476
- She's barely breathing.
- She... She's gonna be fine.

41
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,753
Okay.

42
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,909
We're gonna get you out of here.

43
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,315
Can you help me get her out of here?

44
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,958
Come on. Come on.

45
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,158
Chloe?

46
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,239
Chloe?

47
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,670
Where'd you go, chloe?

48
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,956
Where'd you go, chloe?

49
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,229
Everything's under control here, officers.
I'm sure you're needed elsewhere.

50
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,188
He has the key.

51
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,548
Who are you?

52
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,149
- Are you Kal-EI?
- Who wants to know?

53
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,311
It's not him. Kal-El would not bleed.

54
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,799
Clark?

55
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,272
Clark!

56
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,715
I thought Krypton was destroyed.

57
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,154
<i>It was.</i>

58
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,993
<i>But here in your Fortress of Solitude...</i>

59
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,711
<i>... the geography of our planet</i>
<i>has been replicated for your training.</i>

60
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,949
I know there's a lot
I can learn from you...

61
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,031
...but I have to get home
where I'm needed.

62
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,994
<i>The meteor shower</i>
<i>is only the precursor.</i>

63
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,272
<i>A dark force from Krypton</i>
<i>has been awakened, Kal-EI...</i>

64
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,512
<i>... and its sights are set on Earth.</i>

65
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,550
What do you want me to do?

66
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,590
<i>You must do as I tell you</i>
<i>and study with diligence...</i>

67
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,594
<i>... for that is the only way</i>
<i>to save this planet.</i>

68
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,997
Clark.

69
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,358
Clark, I know you can hear me. Help.

70
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,749
Clark, please help me.

71
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,952
Chloe.

72
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,030
<i>Kal-EI, you must continue</i>
<i>in your education.</i>

73
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,316
<i>You cannot stop.</i>

74
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,319
She's my friend. She needs help.

75
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,917
<i>Your destiny is far greater</i>
<i>than saving one human life.</i>

76
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,036
No, I won't let her die.

77
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,550
<i>Each time you let</i>
<i>human-learned emotions guide you...</i>

78
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,349
<i>... you put the fate</i>
<i>of the entire planet at risk.</i>

79
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,112
- <i>That is your weakness, Kal-EI.</i>
- Please, I'm begging you.

80
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,149
<i>Very well. Under one condition:</i>

81
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,677
<i>You must return to me</i>
<i>before the yellow sun has set.</i>

82
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,438
I'll be back. I promise.

83
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,596
<i>Do not fail me, Kal-EI...</i>

84
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,955
<i>... or the consequences will be grave.</i>

85
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,271
You have my word.

86
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,919
Hey.

87
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,794
I think it's time you switch
into super-Clark mode now.

88
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,359
Super Clark?

89
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,869
I know you run
faster than a speeding bullet, Clark.

90
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,428
Take me along for the ride.

91
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,508
Go, Clark.

92
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,029
- Lana, what happened?
- They're still out there.

93
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,749
- They'll kill us if they find us.
- It's okay. You're safe now.

94
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,434
Lana, you need to get off that leg.
I'll call a doctor.

95
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,433
You don't understand.
We're not safe. No one's safe.

96
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,876
- Don't touch me!
- Lana, you're in shock.

97
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,712
It's over.

98
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,958
The meteor shower stopped.
It's over.

99
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,511
There's a man and a <i>woman...</i>

100
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,910
...they're right behind us.

101
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,517
- They came out of...
- Out of what?

102
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,514
What did they come out of?

103
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,636
A spaceship.

104
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,030
- Where?
- Landers Field.

105
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,273
After what you've been <i>through...</i>

106
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,273
<i>...it's</i> normal for your mind
to play tricks on you. Trust me.

107
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,194
No, Lex, you trust me.
I know what I saw.

108
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,354
- We have to get as far away as possible.
- Lana.

109
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,559
Thank you.

110
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,631
I wonder who's more freaked out
right now.

111
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,916
Me, knowing that I'm in a <i>hospital...</i>

112
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,594
...where they get their medicine
via dogsled...

113
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,435
...or you, finally finding out
I know your secret?

114
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,353
- How long have you known?
- I guess I've always had my suspicions.

115
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,150
The quick exits, the miraculous
recoveries, the lame excuses.

116
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,790
But I think when I
saw you catch a car...

117
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,791
...like it was a beach ball...

118
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,191
...that kind of confirmed everything.

119
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,233
Why didn't you say anything?

120
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,835
I figured if you wanted to tell me you
were of the superpowered persuasion...

121
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,070
...you would when you were ready.

122
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,276
On your terms, not on mine.

123
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,798
You're a good friend, chloe.

124
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,868
Obviously not good enough.

125
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,150
There were so many times
I wanted to tell you.

126
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,469
Clark, I don't blame you.

127
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,839
Loose lips sink ships, and God knows
I've sunk my share of flotillas.

128
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,437
What about Lana? Does she know?

129
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,109
No.

130
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,876
Well, I want you to know that I will
never be the iceberg to your <i>Titanic.</i>

131
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:20,353
And your secret will never, ever
leave my lips. No matter what.

132
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,674
I appreciate that.

133
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,793
There are still a few blind spots, though.

134
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,396
Like, how did we get beamed from
the Kiwatche cave to the North Pole?

135
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,720
And what was really going on
in that 40-story igloo?

136
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,317
Chloe, there's a lot of things about me
that even I don't understand.

137
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,434
The meteor rocks...

138
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,997
<i>...they</i> didn't make me who I am.

139
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,397
So you're saying
you were born this way?

140
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,270
I wasn't born
anywhere near Smallville.

141
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,836
In fact, I wasn't born
anywhere near this galaxy.

142
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,956
Okay.

143
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,350
Okay, so that would then
make you, like, an...

144
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,033
Yeah.

145
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,476
But you... You look so...

146
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,472
Human?

147
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,191
I'm still the same person.

148
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,558
Clark, I...

149
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,755
I think you're so amazing.

150
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,152
You save people's lives
and take zero credit for it.

151
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,349
To me, you're more than just a hero.

152
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,193
You're a superhero.

153
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,871
- Chloe...
- I'm serious, clark.

154
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,032
If more humans were like you,
the world would be a better place.

155
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,556
<i>In what scientists are describing as</i>
<i>an incredibly rare astronomical event...</i>

156
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,679
<i>... Smallville, Kansas was hit by</i>
<i>the second meteor shower in 16 years...</i>

157
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,357
<i>... killing 23 people</i>
<i>and injuring scores of others.</i>

158
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,353
They didn't get out.
My parents didn't get out.

159
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,193
Smallville needs you
more than I do, Clark. Go.

160
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,113
Go!

161
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,237
Mr. Luthor?

162
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,231
Mr. Luthor.

163
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,798
Are you okay?

164
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,076
The Disciples of Zod...

165
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,232
...they must be stopped.

166
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,830
You're talking about
the people from the ship.

167
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,949
Their home is their only poison.

168
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,791
Their home...

169
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,155
...is their only poison.

170
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,151
Where are they?

171
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,475
- He's dropping EP.
- <i>Team to ICU, please.</i>

172
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,631
- <i>Team to ICU.</i>
- Got it.

173
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,028
Oh, Martha Kent, if you were trying
to scare me, you did one heck of a job.

174
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,115
For a minute there
I thought I lost you.

175
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,556
I guess I found my way back.

176
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,993
Has Clark come home?

177
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,351
Sweetheart, please, you need to use
all of your energy to get better...

178
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,118
...not to worry about Clark.

179
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,030
Our son can handle anything
that's thrown his way.

180
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,428
Mrs. Kent.

181
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,034
I have to say, you look a whole lot better
without a china cabinet on your back.

182
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,158
Hi, Lois. It's good to see you.

183
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,551
- Lois was quite a hero out there.
- You guys put a roof over my head.

184
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,109
Least I could do is help
when it came crashing down.

185
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,114
- Where is Kal-EI?
- Who are you?

186
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,514
You know where he is.

187
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,029
I'm sorry, I don't know
who you're talking about.

188
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,839
Okay. Everyone needs to calm down
and count to 10, okay?

189
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,230
So put the nice man down.

190
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,077
Look, super freak,
you wanna find your Kal-El buddy...

191
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,391
...you better start working
on your communication skills.

192
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,796
I know where Kal-El is.

193
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,910
He's hiding out at the Luthor mansion.
I can take you to him.

194
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,832
Lana...

195
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,992
Mom? Dad?

196
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,993
Clark.

197
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,915
- Thank God you're okay.
- Where's my mom and dad?

198
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,117
At the hospital. Your mom
has a concussion and a broken leg...

199
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,788
<i>...but</i> she's gonna be okay.
She's out of danger now.

200
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,520
- What about Lana?
- Lana's safe.

201
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,076
It's chloe I'm worried about.

202
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,230
- Why?
- She was down in the cave with me...

203
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,356
...when the meteors hit.

204
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,720
I was knocked out,
and when I came to, she was gone.

205
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,750
She must have escaped
while you were unconscious.

206
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,629
Or someone helped her out.

207
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,031
What, you think I did?

208
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,869
- Lex, how could l...?
- Clark, before I passed out...

209
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,510
...there was a light
brighter than anything I've ever seen.

210
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,154
And I could have sworn I saw you
standing right in its epicenter.

211
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,193
I was nowhere near those caves.

212
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,756
If you weren't with your parents when
the meteors hit, where have you been?

213
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,512
They insisted I get a head start.

214
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,871
I got a ride on one of the military vans.

215
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,032
Why do I get this feeling
you're being less than honest with me?

216
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,800
- I have no idea.
- I'm beginning to get the <i>impression...</i>

217
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,552
...that lying is a habit of yours.

218
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,349
- I don't have to listen to this.
- Then be straight with me for once.

219
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,710
If you're my <i>friend...</i>

220
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,793
...just tell me the truth.

221
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,556
Were you in the cave
when the meteors hit?

222
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,919
No.

223
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,596
Look, I understand that the police
have their hands full...

224
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,149
...but Mr. And Mrs. Universe...

225
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,959
- ...they're killing people.
- Lois.

226
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,190
Clark. You're okay.

227
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,759
Yeah. You?

228
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,388
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Have you seen my parents?

229
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,711
- They're gonna be fine.
- Where are they?

230
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,232
Actually, we have another problem.

231
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,277
Kind of a big problem, really.

232
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,431
A happy, loving couple
came through here...

233
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,353
...with superhuman powers
and a really bad attitude.

234
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,959
It got pretty ugly.

235
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,313
What'd they want?

236
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,519
They were looking for some guy
named Kal-EI. You ever hear of him?

237
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,356
Where'd they go?

238
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,350
Kal-EI's in there.

239
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,355
It's a trap. Get the door.
Seal it.

240
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,356
Lying is their way.

241
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,794
Not for long.

242
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,959
I heard you're looking for me.

243
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,111
I'm Kal-EI.

244
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,199
At last.

245
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,913
Who are you?

246
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,111
The last survivors of Krypton.

247
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,795
- What do you want?
- We want you to join us, Kal-EI.

248
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,397
- And help us make this land our utopia.
- I saw what you did at the hospital.

249
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,358
- It's not utopia, it's murder.
- The few must be sacrificed...

250
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,879
...for the sake of the many.

251
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,951
Then sacrifice me.

252
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,273
Because I'm not gonna let you kill
anyone else.

253
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,316
If that is your decision,
so be it, Kal-EI.

254
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,271
We cannot destroy you, Kal-EI.

255
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:12,198
But we can lock you in a place
where you will never be able to stop us.

256
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,559
It is done.

257
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,792
Clark.

258
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,952
Are you okay?

259
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,712
- Where are they?
- They're gone.

260
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,391
Do you know who they were?

261
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,955
We need to get you to a hospital.

262
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,673
Oh, my God.

263
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,236
Our home.

264
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,600
It's just wood and plaster, Martha.

265
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,598
Fact is, our family's still standing.

266
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,673
We might be a little bruised,
but I think we're stronger for it.

267
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,518
You're right.

268
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,069
A house can always be rebuilt.

269
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,393
It doesn't hurt to have
a one-man construction team as a son.

270
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,518
- Hi.
- Hi.

271
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,674
Don't worry. Things are gonna
get back to normal soon.

272
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,076
Actually, things will be a lot more
normal around here than you think.

273
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,753
My abilities are gone.

274
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,272
- How?
- Jor-El took them.

275
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,149
But I'm not sure it's such a bad thing.

276
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,270
All I've ever wanted was to be normal.
And now, finally...

277
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,238
...I am.

278
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,869
I don't think that this adjustment is
gonna be quite as easy as you do, Clark.

279
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,755
But that's why I'm lucky
to have parents like you.

280
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,956
Every time I woke up
and had a new ability...

281
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,192
...you were there to help me adjust.
And this time's no different.

282
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,791
It is different. You can get hurt now.
You're vulnerable.

283
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,830
Isn't that what it means
to be human?

284
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,188
No, I can't imagine Jor-El
giving up on you that easily.

285
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,994
I took care of the danger
he warned me about.

286
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,475
If losing my abilities is the consequence,
then I think he's done with me.

287
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,479
Look, it's all in the past now.

288
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,954
I'm ready to take a step to the future.

289
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,670
Start by rebuilding this house
one board at a time.

290
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,079
Clark?

291
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,074
Now, how could Clark
possibly be here?

292
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,999
We're in the middle of the Yukon.

293
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,479
I don't know.
I must have been dreaming, I guess.

294
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,954
What's going on, Lex?

295
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,358
I came to take you home.

296
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,877
Clark, really, you shouldn't have.

297
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,951
- Actually, I didn't.
- Too sweet for words.

298
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,917
How'd you get that frog
in your throat?

299
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,868
That's what happens when you get a
neck massage from Barbie the Barbarian.

300
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,834
Doctor says I shouldn't talk too much.

301
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,479
Oh, gee, that's too bad.

302
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,279
Don't get your hopes up, Smallville.
It's not permanent.

303
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,432
I gotta catch a plane in two hours
for Geneva, and if I'm <i>late...</i>

304
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,797
...the general will court-martial me.
- I did wanna say thank you.

305
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,199
You were there for my parents.
It means a lot.

306
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,034
I'm sure it does.

307
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,354
But not enough to give me
this deluxe iris arrangement...

308
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,112
...from Main Street Florist.

309
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,233
She's down the hall, room 258.

310
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,960
Hope irises are still
on your favorite-flowers list.

311
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,033
Some things stay number one forever.
Thank you.

312
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,078
Lana, before the meteor shower,
you came by the barn.

313
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,753
You said some things.

314
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,037
And three words sort of stood out.

315
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,589
Clark, the sky was literally
about to fall down on us.

316
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,671
I never knew if I'd ever see you again.

317
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,479
Right.

318
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,712
We were in the middle of a crisis.

319
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,110
Sometimes people say things
they don't mean.

320
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,952
Clark...

321
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,514
...I meant every word.

322
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,076
The question is...

323
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,552
...did you?

324
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,111
No more secrets.

325
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,111
No more lies.

326
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,916
Clark, I wanna ask you something.

327
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,671
Do you believe in life
on other planets?

328
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,393
Actually, I do.

329
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,710
I saw something in that crater.

330
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,593
It was a spaceship, Clark.

331
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,799
It was unbelievable.

332
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,071
