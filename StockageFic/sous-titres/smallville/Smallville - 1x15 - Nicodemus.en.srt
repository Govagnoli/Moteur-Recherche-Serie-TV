1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,040
Yeah.

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,480
It's James Beels.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,440
Lionel Luthor. He's expecting my call.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,400
So how about this: I don't care
if he's in a meeting, get him out of it!

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,640
Tell him I found something!

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,280
No, I won't hold! Get him!

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,280
What's your hurry, pal?

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,960
Hey.

9
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,640
Move it, already!

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,920
Get out of my way!

11
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,160
Hey, in the truck! You all right?

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,960
Hey, hey!
Come on. Gotta get you out of here.

13
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,840
Smoke. Smoke.
I'm gonna put you down.

14
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,600
All right, come on, now.

15
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,080
Can you hear me? Are you okay?

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,160
We gotta get you out of here.

17
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,640
Nicodemus

18
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,040
Dr. Hamilton.

19
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,200
I thought part of our arrangement
was that you don't drop in on me.

20
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,040
A situation's come up in my lab.

21
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,480
Don't you mean your barn?

22
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,800
One of my experiments was stolen
by one of your employees.

23
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,440
Why would anyone at LuthorCorp
know about your work?

24
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,680
He was helping me
install new equipment.

25
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,680
What'd he steal?

26
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,360
A flower.

27
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,920
You're kidding.

28
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,280
It's called the Nicodemus.
It's been extinct for a hundred years.

29
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,440
I hired you to study the effects
of meteors on this town.

30
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,960
That is your focus. You're a geologist.

31
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,040
Why are you wasting time bringing
flowers back from the dead?

32
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,040
I irradiated the dormant seeds
with meteor fragments.

33
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,000
I want to know the effects on people,
not plants.

34
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,080
It's a first step. That's what science is.

35
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,400
It's a process, a journey.
You know what?

36
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,480
Either you understand that,
or you find someone else.

37
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,960
What's his name?

38
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,240
James Beels. I just found out
he was in a car accident.

39
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,320
He almost didn't make it
but another driver pulled him out.

40
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,280
- Don't tell me it was Clark Kent.
- Actually it was his father, Jonathan.

41
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,120
Mom? Dad?

42
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,480
I just heard about the...

43
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,320
I did not need to see that.

44
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:57,040
Hey, son. Just getting the old hero's
welcome, you know what I mean?

45
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,600
What's going on with Dad?

46
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,800
I don't know. He's been acting
strange ever since he got home.

47
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,720
Hey, Clark, football game on TV.
You want to watch it with me?

48
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,200
Don't you have work to do?

49
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,120
Chores can wait.

50
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,040
Besides... Whoa!

51
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,720
I earned a rest. You can
pick up the slack for me, can't you?

52
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,600
Jonathan.

53
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,760
It's good to see this whole hero thing
didn't go to your head.

54
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,840
- Hope I'm not interrupting.
- Hi, Lex. Come in.

55
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,680
What's up, Lex?

56
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,160
- I'm looking for Mr. Kent.
- What do you want?

57
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,360
I heard you pulled my employee out of
a car, I wanted to see if you were okay.

58
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,360
No, you didn't. You wanted to see
if I was gonna sue you or not.

59
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,600
That would put an end to all
my financial difficulty, wouldn't it?

60
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,560
- Jonathan, that's enough.
- No, it's not enough, Martha.

61
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,600
You see, I don't like Lex Luthor...

62
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,240
...I don't like Lionel Luthor, and I don't
like your friendship with my son.

63
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,960
In fact, if all of you Luthors were to
dry up and die, I wouldn't shed a tear.

64
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,960
Dad, that's enough.

65
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,320
I think I'll take a nap.

66
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,960
Lex...

67
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,160
Wow. Drinking beer, mouthing off
and counter-macking with your mom?

68
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,520
Congratulations, Clark, your dad's
regressed back to being a teenager.

69
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,000
He's been under a lot of stress,
but I wonder if he's beginning to crack.

70
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
Who takes a three-hour nap
in the afternoon?

71
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,120
I don't know, but I still like
the part where he dissed Lex.

72
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,960
Why? What do you have against Lex?

73
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,040
Let's see. He screwed my family
out of the creamed-corn factory.

74
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,600
Well, that was 12 years ago.
And it was his father.

75
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,880
- I've never been crazy about him.
- Why haven't you said something?

76
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,960
I was hoping
you'd see he was bad news.

77
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,440
What's your deepest desire?

78
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,960
If nothing was holding you back,
what would you do?

79
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,880
Hello, Chloe, nice to see you too.
What's up?

80
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,960
Principal Kwan thinks
I need to get in touch...

81
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,760
...with the pulse of the student body.

82
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,400
So I've decided to do a poll. Now, if you
would both do your statistical duty.

83
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,800
I'd go over and make out
with that girl right now.

84
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,000
You know, every answer
I've gotten so far...

85
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,280
...has been either
sex- or violence-related.

86
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,120
That's human nature, Chloe. Later.

87
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,680
Hi.

88
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,680
Did you know that Pete doesn't like Lex?

89
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,480
Yeah, he's totally jealous
of your friendship with him.

90
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,840
He feels you aren't
as close as you used to be.

91
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,400
Hey.

92
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,400
Hi.

93
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,400
What about you, Lana? Got one?

94
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,120
I would climb the windmill
out in Chandler's field.

95
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,360
Really? That's your deepest desire.

96
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,320
Somebody told me you could see
the Metropolis skyline from there.

97
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,160
I haven't got the guts
to climb up and see for myself.

98
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,160
Okay.

99
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,640
- I can always make something up.
- No, it's good. It's good, I like it.

100
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,240
It's unleashing the inner Lana.

101
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,640
Okay.

102
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,440
Okay, Clark, you're up.

103
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,560
Clark. Remember, it's a PG-13 poll.

104
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,560
Since Whitney's dad
has been in the hospital...

105
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,880
...there's been a no-fly zone over Lana.

106
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,640
There are other girls out there that don't
require crossing an emotional minefield.

107
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,800
But I can't just
turn off my feelings for her.

108
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,000
You know, the choice is yours.

109
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,240
You can either sit in your loft and
play with your telescope, or move on.

110
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,240
- Hi.
- Hi.

111
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,240
What do you say you and I go up into
the hayloft and have us a little fun, huh?

112
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,000
Not now. Somebody's gotta
do some work around here.

113
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,920
Maybe you would like
to call Lex Luthor and apologize.

114
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,560
Why? All I did was tell him the truth.

115
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,640
I know I said you should let your feelings
out, but you're taking this too far.

116
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,760
What's wrong with you?

117
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,440
Nothing.

118
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,600
- I feel free.
- Well, you don't look well.

119
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,600
You're burning up. Go back to bed.
I'll make you soup when I get back.

120
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,560
Hey.

121
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
I know a much better way
to break a fever.

122
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,040
Sweetheart, I have to go, really.

123
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,480
This is the Kents, leave a message.

124
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,720
Jonathan, it's Jim Alexander
over at the bank.

125
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,440
I'm gonna be straight with you.

126
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,240
I'm afraid we're going to have to
turn down your loan.

127
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,520
Hello, Jim? Yeah, listen to me.

128
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,200
I have done nothing
but give back to this community...

129
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,000
...and all anyone has ever done
for me is screw me over.

130
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,960
So I'm gonna come down to that bank...

131
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,520
...and you are going to have to
turn my loan down right to my face.

132
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,040
That way I can see
whether you have a pair...

133
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,640
...or whether your wife
keeps them in a drawer.

134
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,520
Where did you learn to drive, you jerk?

135
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,680
Slow down!

136
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,000
Dad, what are you doing?

137
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,240
I've done nothing but give to this town,
and they screw me over.

138
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,560
They've pushed me too far,
and I'm pushing back.

139
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,760
Not with a shotgun.

140
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,400
- Slow down. You're not thinking.
- I'm thinking just fine, son.

141
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,800
Now get out of my way!

142
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,160
Clark.

143
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,680
Dad.

144
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,520
Dad.

145
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,560
His symptoms indicate
a severe anaphylactic shock.

146
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,560
But we can't detect
any known antigens.

147
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,880
What is it then?

148
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,920
Truth is, if he'd come in just yesterday,
I'd say I'd never seen anything like it.

149
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,160
But we admitted a car-crash victim
this morning, a James Beels?

150
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,920
Showed identical symptoms.

151
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,600
That's the guy Dad saved.
How's he doing?

152
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,360
Not good.

153
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,080
He fell into a coma an hour ago.

154
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,640
Okay, so, what are we doing out here?

155
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,480
Mr. Kent and Mr. Beels
have the same symptoms.

156
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,120
This is the only place
they've been together...

157
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,720
...so I think what happened to
Mr. Kent was caused by something here.

158
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,000
- What are we looking for?
- Anything.

159
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,280
Wow. The debris starts from way
over there and ends over in that ditch.

160
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,360
That's some serious road rage.

161
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,960
I think I found something.

162
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,480
What you got?

163
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,600
Sorry.

164
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,880
That's all right. Let's get out of here.
This place is a dead end.

165
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,880
Gesundheit.

166
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,960
Seems you haven't been completely
honest with me, Dr. Hamilton.

167
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,680
I told you, it's under control.

168
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,760
Two men with an unexplained illness...

169
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,560
...for which no one seems to know
the cure isn't my idea of under control.

170
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,920
I did a little research of my own into
your unauthorized botany experiment.

171
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,120
Apparently, in 1871 a strange contagion
struck the Morley settlement...

172
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,680
...and 200 people died almost overnight.

173
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,200
A priest who witnessed
the scene left a diary.

174
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,080
His last entries describe how the
settlers began acting out of character.

175
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,440
He claimed a local flower was to blame.

176
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,960
"On God's green earth,
this flower was the thief in the temple.

177
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,480
The silent temptress that,
with a single sneeze...

178
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,040
...brought out the basest instincts
in men and drove them to violence."

179
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,240
That's been relegated
to folklore in scientific circles.

180
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,960
If you don't believe in this, you won't
mind if I lift the lid and smell the flower?

181
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,600
Why'd you bring it back?

182
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,040
These flowers were believed
to have toxins that, while deadly...

183
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,280
...might have other applications.

184
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,880
I'm not here to bankroll
your pet projects.

185
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,760
I'm only interested in the meteors.

186
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,000
You wanted to know
what they could do.

187
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,240
Putting people in the hospital
wasn't the plan.

188
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,280
Every discovery has their consequences.

189
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,600
If Jonathan Kent dies...

190
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,960
...you're gonna lose something
more valuable than your tenure.

191
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,800
Pack up a flower. I've got a team of
specialists in Metropolis to work on it.

192
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,120
- It's my research.
- I don't give a damn about your research.

193
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,600
I just want to find a cure.

194
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,840
Wow.

195
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,400
What's the occasion?

196
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,840
Nothing. I just thought
we'd blow off class today.

197
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,040
I...

198
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,760
I can't.

199
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,880
I'm barely keeping ahead,
and I gotta go to the store...

200
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,200
...and then run by the hospital
and see my dad.

201
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,200
You know what?
I am tired of your excuses.

202
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,240
Ever since your dad got sick,
you haven't been any fun at all.

203
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,520
I'm sorry, Lana,
but it's kind of a big deal.

204
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,960
Whatever. I feel like I'm locked
in this relationship out of guilt.

205
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,320
Lana. What's wrong with you?

206
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,200
Nothing. I'm just not
keeping it inside anymore.

207
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,360
If that's how you feel, maybe
we need to reconsider this relationship.

208
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,520
Okay, fine.

209
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,880
It's over, Whitney.

210
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,240
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Oh, Lana.

211
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,880
Nice.

212
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,440
Not going to class, Clark?

213
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,560
I'm not really up... to it.

214
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,800
What's the matter?

215
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,840
Nothing. It's just a change.

216
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,960
You like it?

217
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,000
I think the operative word is "gulp."

218
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,760
Listen.

219
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,760
I know things are rough,
but you can't let them get you down.

220
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,640
It's kind of hard not to.

221
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:51,120
The key is to keep your mind off it.

222
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,760
Let your friends be your friends.

223
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,840
Let them distract you.

224
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,680
Trust them.

225
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,960
I do trust you, Lana.

226
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,280
Good.

227
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,920
Then follow me.

228
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,840
What are we doing in here?

229
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,640
It's quiet.

230
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,760
It's also completely...

231
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,360
...off-limits.

232
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,560
Lana, I don't think I'm really up for this.

233
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,400
You think too much, Clark.

234
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,640
Right now I'm thinking
you don't seem like yourself.

235
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,000
Or maybe...

236
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,000
...I'm more me than ever.

237
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,000
Lana, this is crazy.

238
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,680
That's the point.

239
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,520
If life doesn't make you crazy,
then why bother living it?

240
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,800
I know that's how I want it.

241
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,440
Question is:

242
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,520
Do you want what I want?

243
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,680
Lana!

244
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,440
Don't you want to come in, Clark?

245
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,080
I don't think so.

246
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,800
I know you want me, Clark.

247
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,560
Just stop holding back. Come on.

248
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,360
You're not made of steel.
Or are you?

249
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,880
Wait.

250
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,200
Aren't you tired of waiting?

251
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,240
Need a little help warming up?

252
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,400
She just stripped down in front of you.
Lana Lang, in all her glory.

253
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,080
Most of her glory. Not that Kwan saw it.

254
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,000
At least you'll have a nice picture to
daydream about in Saturday detention.

255
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,960
She said everything
I wanted to hear...

256
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,280
...but it didn't seem like she knew
what she was doing.

257
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,480
What do you think
made Lana go soft-core?

258
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,680
First my dad, now Lana.

259
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,360
Yeah, and don't forget that Beels guy.
Remember the one that your dad helped?

260
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,200
You must have missed something
at the accident site.

261
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,880
No, I didn't.
Because I was there and I'm fine.

262
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,480
It just doesn't make any sense.

263
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,280
Wait. Looks like we weren't
the only ones out there.

264
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,960
Who's that?

265
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,960
I think it's Dr. Hamilton.

266
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,640
- The meteor freak?
- Yeah.

267
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,080
What's he doing
skulking around in the woods?

268
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,760
I don't know, but I have
a feeling it's not just a coincidence.

269
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,120
- I'm gonna go talk to him.
- I'm gonna go talk to Lana.

270
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,680
I think whatever happened
to my father is about to happen to her.

271
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,400
I want something better than progress.

272
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,720
I was just at the hospital,
they're getting worse.

273
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,000
Where have you been?

274
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,320
Monique called in sick,
and no one can cover.

275
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,640
Why is this my problem?

276
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,200
Because Nell's in Metropolis
and you're the assistant manager.

277
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,800
Well, I'm taking the afternoon off,
so I guess we're closing early.

278
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,400
Listen up. We're closing early,
so coffee's on the house. Drink up.

279
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,040
I'll call back.

280
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,240
Lana.

281
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,360
The Talon closes at 9.

282
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,440
Not today.

283
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,320
You're not impressing anyone
with the attitude, Lana.

284
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,440
You're talking to someone who
set the bar for adolescent rebellion.

285
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,520
That's right. I heard you were
quite the bad boy...

286
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,160
...before you joined us here in Smallville.

287
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,560
It's nothing I'm proud of.

288
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,800
Please.
You don't really care about the Talon.

289
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,000
You only invested
because I asked you to.

290
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,680
Now, why would you go
and do a thing like that?

291
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,320
The Luthors are famous
for their ulterior motives.

292
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,440
So tell me, Lex,
was it really about profit?

293
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,960
I'm not sure what this is, but it isn't
you, Lana. Are you feeling okay?

294
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,960
Actually...

295
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,800
I'm a little nervous.

296
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,080
I might need some guidance, you know...

297
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:05,000
...from someone
with a little more experience.

298
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,960
What do you say, boss?

299
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,400
Lana, where have you been
in the last 24 hours?

300
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,080
It's none of your business.

301
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,960
What's your problem?

302
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,160
This isn't you.

303
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,200
Why, because I'm not
doing exactly as I'm told?

304
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,800
Because I'm not sitting
in a corner hiding in a book?

305
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,680
For once I'm not scared of life,
and no one can handle it...

306
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,360
...because you all prefer
the insecure little girl.

307
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,800
Well, I'm sick of her
and all her talk about her dead parents.

308
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,400
Lana!

309
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,880
Dr. Hamilton, hello.
Chloe Sullivan, Smallville Torch.

310
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,800
We spoke on the Internet
about the meteors?

311
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,000
Chloe.

312
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,440
Can you tell me what you were
doing in the woods last night?

313
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,440
What I do there most nights.

314
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,080
Search for meteor samples. I find it
easier to spot them with flashlights.

315
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,240
So you didn't see me and my friend.

316
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,040
I heard voices, I saw flashlights,
I know that kids like to party...

317
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,360
...and as you know,
I don't like company.

318
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,320
You weren't looking
at the accident scene?

319
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,720
What accident?

320
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,920
I must be mistaken.
Sorry to have bothered you.

321
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,360
And what were you doing
in the woods last night?

322
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,000
Partying with my friends.

323
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,760
Lana, what's going on?
Does Lex know you have his car?

324
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,560
He should by now.

325
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,040
Something happened to you,
I just don't know what.

326
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,000
It's called self-confidence.

327
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,480
For the first time,
I'm not repressing my feelings. I'm free.

328
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,680
No, you're not.

329
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,960
You should talk. You had me in the pool,
and you didn't take your chance.

330
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,120
I see the way you look at me.
Why don't you tell me how you feel?

331
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,600
Lana, you're sick.
I need to get you to a hospital.

332
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,680
Don't avoid the question, Clark.

333
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,280
Are you in love with me?

334
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,520
Lana...

335
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,000
Such a coward.
Can't even answer a simple question.

336
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,120
You want me? Come and get me.

337
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,680
Lana, stop!

338
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,800
What's the matter, Clark?
Afraid of heights?

339
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,680
What are you doing? Come down!

340
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,440
Lana!

341
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,360
Lana!

342
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,000
Clark.

343
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,680
Coming through.

344
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,320
What happened?

345
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,200
She's got the
same symptoms as Dad and Beels.

346
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,200
How's Dad?

347
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,720
He slipped into a coma. The doctors
don't know how long he'll last.

348
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,960
I've got doctors flying in
from Metropolis.

349
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,720
I'm going to
do everything I can for Mr. Kent.

350
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,240
Clark, I'm sorry.

351
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,760
It's not your fault, Lex.

352
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,440
Dr. Hamilton
had a copy of this in his barn.

353
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,720
Nicodemus Diary.

354
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,200
It's a first-hand account
of Smallville's first mystery.

355
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,880
In 1871, the everybody went postal
before they even had a post office.

356
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,640
Nice to know Smallville was
whacked before the meteors.

357
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,680
Yeah. In the diary,
they talk about a flower.

358
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,600
The settlers called it Nicodemus.

359
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,960
They said it liberated
repressed feelings...

360
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,000
...sent them into rages,
then fever and finally...

361
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,880
Well...

362
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,480
Well, where can we find this flower?

363
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,960
You see, that's the glitch.

364
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,720
After the massacre,
the cavalry torched the settlement.

365
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,320
They didn't want
whatever caused it to spread.

366
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,280
The flower's been extinct for 100 years.

367
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,560
How is Hamilton involved in this?
He's a geologist.

368
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,840
With a meteor fixation.

369
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,680
We tracked down this paper
he wrote six years ago.

370
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,320
- Metropolis University Press.
- I think this is the last straw.

371
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,720
In it, he postulates that meteor rocks...

372
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,600
...can be used to
irradiate dormant plant cells.

373
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,160
So you think Hamilton
brought back the Nicodemus.

374
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,240
- And now he's trying to cover it up.
- Let's go talk to him.

375
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,520
Wait, there's more. Dr. Hamilton didn't
check out The Nicodemus Diary. Lex did.

376
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,640
You think he's involved?

377
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,760
I told you all along he was bad news.

378
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,600
Pete, we don't know anything yet.

379
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,200
Good.

380
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,840
I'll call back. I just
got off the phone with the doctors.

381
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,360
They've isolated the problem.

382
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,120
Does it have to do with
the Nicodemus flower?

383
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,480
I know you checked
the diary out of the library.

384
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,760
- Yes, I did, Clark.
- Why?

385
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,640
Because my property was built on
the site of the original settlement.

386
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,880
I always thought it was an interesting
story. When I heard about your dad...

387
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,920
...I tracked it down
to see if it could help.

388
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,320
Why didn't you tell me?

389
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,520
Clark, it's a crackpot story.
I was grasping at straws.

390
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,040
- Do you know Dr. Steven Hamilton?
- Who's that?

391
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,360
Don't lie to me!

392
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,840
Clark, calm down.

393
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,800
I know you're worried
about your dad and Lana...

394
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,920
...but I checked the book
out of the library, that's it.

395
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,920
I'm not responsible for what happened...

396
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,400
...and I'm doing everything
in my power to fix it.

397
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,080
That's the truth, Clark.

398
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,160
Okay, keep your flashlight low.

399
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,880
You're an expert on breaking
and entering now?

400
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,080
Be careful!

401
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,600
Pete, what happened?

402
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,440
Pete? You okay?

403
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,760
Pete?

404
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,320
- You looking for me?
- Oh, no.

405
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,640
Do you have any idea
how beautiful you are?

406
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:17,080
Okay, Pete, you've been infected.
We've gotta get you to the hospital.

407
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,000
That's right.
Ignore Pete, he's just the funny guy.

408
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,640
You don't sweat his feelings,
because you've got eyes for Clark.

409
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,160
Calm down, Pete.
I'm going to call Clark.

410
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,800
He's probably hanging out with
his new best friend, Lex Luthor.

411
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,440
Give me your keys.

412
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,120
Why, where are you going?

413
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,200
I'm serious, Chloe.

414
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,160
Give me the damn keys!

415
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,520
How is he?

416
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,280
Not good.

417
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,400
Clark, Mr. Beels died half an hour ago.

418
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,560
With all my abilities,
there's nothing I can do.

419
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,200
What will we do if Dad...?

420
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,120
I don't know.

421
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,120
Did I ever tell you about
the first time I ever saw him?

422
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,240
No.

423
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,520
He came to Metropolis U
to take a finance course...

424
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,640
and he was sitting by a fountain...

425
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,720
...all denim and flannel, eating an apple.

426
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,080
And I asked to borrow his notes.

427
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,240
He didn't know that I was the
note-taker for the class. He still doesn't.

428
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,120
You're sly, Mom.

429
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,760
He was so cute.

430
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,160
So I asked him for his notes,
and he just handed over his notebook...

431
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,680
...without even asking my name,
and I said:

432
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,400
"How can you be sure I'll bring it back?"
And he said:

433
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,280
"I prefer to believe in people."

434
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,520
It sounds like Dad.

435
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,640
And I remember looking at him,
completely embarrassed...

436
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,000
...because I was thinking the
dumbest thing. I was thinking:

437
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,160
"God, I hope he marries me."

438
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,920
I still think that.

439
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:07,160
Every day there's a part of me that says,
"God, I hope he marries me."

440
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,920
I'm sorry, Mrs. Kent.
Can I talk to you for a second, Clark?

441
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,320
Go.

442
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,640
I'm so sorry.

443
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,920
Dr. Hamilton was lying.

444
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,000
I found the Nicodemus flower
in the barn.

445
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,520
One got Pete,
and he took a quick turn to scary.

446
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,440
- Where'd he go?
- He grabbed a gun...

447
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,680
...and he said he was going after Lex.

448
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,800
This flower has existed for...
For hundreds of years.

449
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,440
Now, the Native Americans must have
developed some sort of herbal antidote...

450
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,440
...and these are the instructions.

451
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,880
- Where'd you find it?
- Collecting dust in a museum.

452
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,160
It's a one of a kind,
so they want it back.

453
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,200
I'll get it to my team in Metropolis.

454
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,680
Nobody's going anywhere.

455
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,840
Pete.

456
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,440
What are you doing here?

457
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,720
I knew you were behind this.

458
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,840
You pretended
to be Clark's friend, but you're not.

459
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,360
And now his dad's gonna die.
Because of you.

460
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,840
- What's this about?
- Do not pretend you don't know.

461
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,240
I went to your barn!

462
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
He's infected.

463
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,040
Pete, we have the cure.
We're going to make everyone better.

464
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,320
You're a liar. Clark can't see it,
but I can. And now you're gonna pay.

465
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,520
No!

466
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:55,480
Pete, if that book is destroyed,
you and Lana and Mr. Kent will all die.

467
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,080
- You're lying.
- Pete, I want to help you.

468
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,560
You don't want to help
anybody but yourself!

469
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,600
You come to town and suddenly
you're Clark's new best friend!

470
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,240
I thought he was
a good judge of character.

471
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,640
Lex, the book?

472
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,440
Pete, I'm going to reach in there
and grab that book.

473
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,080
If you want to shoot me...

474
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,440
...go ahead.

475
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,760
No problem.

476
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,800
Get out.

477
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,240
Say goodbye, Lex.

478
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,000
Pete! Don't do it.

479
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,880
We used to be best friends.

480
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,600
His dad screwed over my dad...

481
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,720
...and now he's trying
to screw up things between us.

482
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,280
- The world's a better place without him.
- Pete, put the gun down.

483
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,360
He's behind all this. I saw Hamilton here.

484
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,840
They're working on this together!

485
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,680
- Is that true?
- Clark. He's delusional.

486
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,320
I don't believe you. You're right,
Pete, he's been lying to everyone.

487
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,160
I know who my true friends are.

488
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,680
I knew you'd see the light.

489
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,320
Clark, what are you doing?

490
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,480
Can't talk your way out of this one, Lex.

491
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,760
I see you how you really are.
The friendship is over.

492
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,040
Nice one.

493
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,480
I'll finish him.

494
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,640
How'd you do that?

495
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,680
Don't worry, Pete,
we'll get you to the hospital.

496
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,760
Clark, what the hell?

497
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,160
I'm sorry, Lex.

498
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,600
So that was an act?

499
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,560
I didn't know what else to do.
He was gonna shoot you.

500
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,560
You had me for a moment.
I thought you were serious.

501
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,520
What do they feed you on that farm?

502
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,440
Was Hamilton really here?

503
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,000
What do you think, Clark?

504
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,200
Morning, sleepyhead.

505
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,920
Dad, you're okay.

506
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:39,080
Yeah. Clark.
Clark, what am I doing here?

507
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,440
Jonathan! Oh, sweetheart!

508
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,800
- Martha.
- Oh, sweetheart!

509
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,960
The doctors in Metropolis
found a cure last night.

510
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,880
It was an old Native American remedy.

511
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,480
- How are Pete and Lana?
- They're already up.

512
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,760
- Dad, do you remember anything?
- No.

513
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,080
The doctors think
it's because of the fever.

514
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,240
Trust me, it's better that way.

515
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,680
- Come on, what are you talking about?
- Oh, sweetheart.

516
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,080
Dr. Hamilton, hello?

517
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,440
- What'd you do with my lab?
- Destroyed it.

518
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,760
- How dare you!
- You're lucky you found a cure...

519
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,080
...and nobody infected
can remember anything.

520
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,480
But people are talking.

521
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,160
Beels worked for my father,
and then there's Chloe Sullivan.

522
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,480
I'm sensing this relationship is over.

523
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,320
No, doctor, I think you're very talented.
You just need closer supervision.

524
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,520
I recently acquired a small
research facility outside Metropolis.

525
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,360
Cadmus Labs?
I'm gonna hide you out there.

526
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,200
Remember, Lex,
you're the one opening Pandora's box.

527
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,320
I'm just the key, Dr. Hamilton.

528
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,320
Okay, open your eyes, Lana.

529
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,720
There's Metropolis.

530
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,680
It's beautiful.

531
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,800
I can't believe we're up here.

532
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,040
It's actually getting down which
is gonna be the interesting part.

533
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,080
It's good to have you back, Lana.

534
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,800
I spent the entire day apologizing to the
Talon staff and to Lex and to Whitney.

535
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,360
I just wish I could remember
what happened.

536
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,880
It sounds like
I got a little out of control there.

537
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:08,760
You spoke your mind, and you did what
you wanted. Kind of an alpha Lana.

538
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,080
I couldn't believe what I was wearing.

539
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,360
I kind of liked it.

540
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,600
I didn't say or do anything embarrassing
to you that I should know about...

541
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,600
...did I?

542
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,400
No.

543
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,440
Good. Good.

544
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,080
So how does it feel
to be on top of the world?

545
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,760
Or at least Smallville?

546
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,960
I feel free.

547
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,560
