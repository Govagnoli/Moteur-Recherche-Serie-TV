1
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,942
Son of a gun!

2
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:22,110
Don't use the upstairs bathroom. It's
backed up. I have to snake the pipes.

3
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,621
-Where's the leftover pizza?
-Fridge, second shelf.

4
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,385
Or you could nuke
the chili for dinner.

5
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,789
Clark?

6
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,858
Some clue you actually heard me.

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,797
Upstairs bathroom off-limits
after nuclear chili dinner.

8
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,938
Glad to see your hearing
hasn't changed.

9
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:42,598
Clark, can I get
a hand out here, please?

10
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:49,672
Son, would you--?

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,875
-Sure.
-Thanks.

12
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:57,280
Sure picked one heck of a day
to snap an exhaust hanger.

13
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:01,416
I left the number of our hotel on
the nightstand. I think that's everything.

14
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:05,929
That ought to do it.
I'm definitely raising your allowance.

15
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,691
-lf you need anything--
-Call.

16
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,765
Mom, it's a couple of nights
in Metropolis. I'll be fine.

17
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:15,238
<i>I'm sure he'll be fine.
And soon, madame, so shall we be.</i>

18
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,503
I almost forgot. Sorry.

19
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:22,443
Happy anniversary.

20
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,841
Sweetheart, bye-bye.

21
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,815
Clark, thanks for the card.

22
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:33,118
Think fast!

23
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,214
Good night, little one.

24
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,330
Don't worry.

25
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,027
Daddy's gonna get better.

26
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,624
Hello?

27
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,855
Is someone there?

28
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,602
It's okay, honey. It's just thunder.

29
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,114
Will!

30
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,385
Earl? What are you doing here?

31
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,854
I need to see Lionel Luthor.

32
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,228
-I know he's here.
-Sorry, man, you know I can't let you in.

33
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:27,090
They did something to me
at his plant in Smallville.

34
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,600
See, that's the talk that got
yourself canned, all right?

35
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:36,038
-lf you've got a problem, get some help.
-I've tried. They can't do anything.

36
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,801
It's getting worse.

37
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,139
Please, let me in.

38
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,476
Earl, don't make me call security,
all right?

39
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,915
Just go home and dry off.

40
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,120
What the hell?

41
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,856
Earl?

42
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,171
What the hell you doing, Earl?!

43
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:14,406
-lf I don't get an answer, I'll die.
-No, we gotta get you to a doctor!

44
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:18,108
Look, they can't do anything.
Nobody can.

45
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,296
What will you do now that you're
officially home alone?

46
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,531
I was thinking of having
a few people over.

47
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:51,609
Do my ears deceive me or is Clark Kent
actually suggesting a party?

48
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,509
Small gathering. You guys,
a few other people, maybe Lana.

49
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:58,412
With or without her posable
action-figure boyfriend?

50
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,246
Eight o'clock.

51
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,356
-And remember, the keyword is "small."
-Small.

52
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,202
So this is what you'd call
a small gathering, right?

53
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,860
Do you even recognize
half these people?

54
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,200
Watch the glass--

55
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,887
Dude, I think I'm gonna hurl.

56
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,706
Thanks.

57
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,688
Pretty cool party!

58
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,621
Lana. Thanks.

59
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,086
It's kind of impromptu.

60
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,198
Sometimes you just have to kick back
and blow off some steam.

61
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:24,633
If I had 100 people trashing my house,
I'd be a little freaked out.

62
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,798
After the first few dishes,
you get used to it.

63
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,640
I don't think I'd be
brave enough to risk it.

64
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,836
I don't know, Lana.
I bet you're braver than you think.

65
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,709
You flying solo tonight?

66
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:41,351
You mean, what am I doing here
without Whitney?

67
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:45,515
I am capable of enjoying myself
without him.

68
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:49,894
Fireworks!

69
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:55,897
-You're full of surprises tonight, Clark.
-Tell me about it.

70
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,504
Clark, man, how cool is this?

71
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,004
Pete, why didn't you just call
the cops? It'd be easier.

72
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,340
I can't claim credit.
It wasn't my idea.

73
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,244
It was mine.

74
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,744
Call it a party gift.
I hope you like it.

75
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,889
-It's great, it's just--
-Forget the police. It's covered.

76
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,558
This kind of party can make
or break a reputation.

77
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,354
I wanted to make sure yours was a hit.

78
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:29,532
-I hear you're taking a tour of my plant.
-It's a class field trip.

79
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,536
-What'd you do wrong?
-It's that bad, huh?

80
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:38,275
Sorry I took so long.
Someone overflowed the bathroom.

81
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,340
I'm officially dead.

82
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,523
There's no answer.

83
00:09:56,696 --> 00:10:00,393
He's fine, he's fine.
We have to trust him, Martha.

84
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:03,627
-I do, but I still worry.
-I know.

85
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,134
Metropolis....

86
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,136
Do you--? Do you miss it?

87
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,339
-Sometimes.
-Yeah.

88
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:16,513
But I didn't move to Smallville
for action and glamour.

89
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:22,144
I moved because a certain man
told me we'd never be rich...

90
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:25,917
...or travel the world,
but he'd always love me.

91
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,027
How could I pass up
an offer like that?

92
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,440
-Whitney, what are you doing here?
-Looking for you.

93
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,246
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming here?

94
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:57,583
It was kind of last-minute. I didn't
realize I needed your permission.

95
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,123
Lana, can we talk outside?

96
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,525
Oh, my gosh! Did--?

97
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,729
Lana, what's going on?

98
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:13,168
I told you when we got back together
that I needed some breathing room.

99
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,500
So you sneak off to a party
without me?

100
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,701
I didn't sneak. I walked.

101
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,346
And why are you mad at me?

102
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,278
Is it because it's Clark's party?

103
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,476
I'm starting to get the feeling
that you don't trust me.

104
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,888
Clark!

105
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,260
You better get out here.

106
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,638
Kent, get up here.

107
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,498
-Got him!
-Earl.

108
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,928
Back off, I know him.

109
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,900
Earl, what are you doing here?

110
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,905
I came to see your dad.
He's the only one I can trust.

111
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,704
He's out of town.

112
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,683
What's wrong with you?

113
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:44,887
I'll call an ambulance.

114
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:55,834
-This guy should be in a detox center.
-He's not on drugs, Chloe.

115
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,034
Then why was he shaking like a junkie?

116
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,338
Earl worked on the farm
for six seasons.

117
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,573
I spent 12 hours a day
with the guy in the fields.

118
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:08,346
He even tried to teach me how to play
guitar. He says it impresses women.

119
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,786
We're all a sucker for a guy
with a six-string.

120
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,516
How come I've never heard you play?

121
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:19,097
I kept snapping the guitar strings.
I think Earl got sick of replacing them.

122
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,324
Just because you spend time
with someone...

123
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:24,595
...doesn't mean you know
their darkest secrets.

124
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,569
-He was like family.
-Then why'd he leave?

125
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,107
He took a job at the LuthorCorp plant.

126
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,440
It was full-time,
and the pay was better.

127
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:40,243
-Where can we find Earl Jenkins?
-Exam Room 3, down the hall.

128
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,981
Excuse me. I'm a friend of Earl's.
Is he in some kind of trouble?

129
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,057
Oh, yeah.

130
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,386
We need help in here!

131
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,398
Earl!

132
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,018
Hi. You're home early.

133
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:28,524
We called six times last night,
spoke with six different people...

134
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,628
...none of whom knew who you were.

135
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,823
It was supposed to be
an intimate occasion.

136
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,336
-Clark, where have you been?
-The hospital.

137
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:41,036
-That's it. I'm never leaving home again.
-Who got hurt?

138
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,607
Nobody, but I found
Earl Jenkins hiding in the loft.

139
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,678
He was looking for you, Dad.
He's all messed up.

140
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:51,510
-What's the matter with Earl?
-I don't know. He's wanted for murder.

141
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,151
Earl?

142
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,381
What'd he say for himself?

143
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,853
-I couldn't get close.
-How come, the police?

144
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:02,393
No. Because when I got near him,
I got sick.

145
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,395
It was weird.

146
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:09,399
Every time I stood next to him,
it got worse. It's kind of like--

147
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,901
Like what?

148
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,600
It's kind of like the way I feel
around meteor fragments.

149
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,219
What's wrong with him?

150
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,292
Well, to be honest,
I haven't the faintest idea.

151
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:39,830
It's amazing his body's been able
to survive the seizures this long.

152
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,493
Take a look at the x-rays.

153
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:48,802
It looks like mineral poisoning,
but it's not a mineral I've seen before.

154
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,532
Is that why he's shaking so hard?

155
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,803
Mineral fragments are embedded
under his skin.

156
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:56,210
-His body is trying to push them out.
-How did they get there?

157
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,943
He claims there was an explosion
at the LuthorCorp plant six months ago.

158
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,088
-I didn't hear about that.
-That's because it didn't happen.

159
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:08,250
I pulled the plant's safety records.
I checked with OSHA and the EPA.

160
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,927
-Can I go in and talk to him by myself?
-Better hurry up.

161
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,763
Metropolis P.D. will be here any minute
to transfer him back to the city.

162
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,336
Thanks.

163
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,441
-I wanna go with you.
-No.

164
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:27,067
Listen, you said that you felt sick
when you got around him, right?

165
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:30,409
I bet what he was exposed to
has to do with those meteor rocks.

166
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,484
I don't want you passing out
around here.

167
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,952
It'd bring us a whole other set
of problems.

168
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,462
Jonathan.

169
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,992
Am I glad to see you.

170
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,864
Hey, look.

171
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:01,146
Clark.
Can you hear me?

172
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,143
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--</i>

173
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,477
<i>I'm fine. Don't worry about it.</i>

174
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:17,419
All right, Earl, what's going on?
I can't believe you'd wanna kill anybody.

175
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:22,125
It was an accident.
I was trying to see Lionel Luthor.

176
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:26,235
-Why?
-Find out what they used on Level 3.

177
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,669
Earl, you're not making any sense.

178
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:34,278
When I got that job
at the Smallville plant...

179
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,007
...I was assigned to clean Level 3.

180
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,710
They were doing these
hush-hush crop experiments.

181
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:45,255
A new kind of fertilizer supposed
to make corn grow twice as fast.

182
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,052
There was something unstable
in that fertilizer.

183
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,524
There was a huge explosion.
I was cleaning at the time.

184
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,257
This stuff, it got under my skin.

185
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:57,501
And the next thing I know...

186
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,265
...they shut it all down,
and I was transferred to Metropolis.

187
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,206
Then two months ago,
the jitters started.

188
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,543
-Did you see a doctor?
-I must have seen 50.

189
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,807
<i>But nobody could tell me
what was wrong.</i>

190
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,508
They needed to know
what I was exposed to.

191
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:18,316
But when I went back to the plant,
they told me that Level 3 didn't exist.

192
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,755
That it never had.

193
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,294
I got to find out what they were using.
That's why I need your help.

194
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,261
You gotta get me out of here.

195
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,134
Earl, you're wanted for murder.

196
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:34,262
You don't understand. I can't control it.
I'm running out of time.

197
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,772
The jitters are getting worse.

198
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:42,005
It's already cost me my job,
my marriage, my baby.

199
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,947
I gotta get back into that plant,
or I'm gonna die.

200
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,187
Help me.

201
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,252
You get some rest, Earl.

202
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,433
My baby.

203
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,771
-Do you think he's telling the truth?
-I have no idea.

204
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:11,899
I have a field trip to LuthorCorp today.
Maybe I could look around.

205
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:15,605
<i>I know you're worried, but Earl has
more trouble than he can handle.</i>

206
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:20,616
<i>And I don't even know if he's in his right
mind. So please, don't do anything.</i>

207
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,978
Mommy, I don't wanna go to the doctor's.
They're gonna give me a shot.

208
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:50,877
-They're not gonna give you a shot.
-That's what you said last time.

209
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,850
Mommy!

210
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:13,565
Hello, everybody, I'm Gabe Sullivan,
plant manager and proud father.

211
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,570
-Hi, sweetheart.
-Hi, Dad.

212
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:19,005
Welcome to LuthorCorp:
"Where we give a crap."

213
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:20,702
Okay, somebody kill me now.

214
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,973
Little fertilizer humor there.

215
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,377
Before we go inside...

216
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,383
...I need you to remove all
your cell phones, pagers, jewelry.

217
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:31,819
Anything that jangles, dangles or rings
has to go in these plastic trays.

218
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,015
Any other questions?
Yes.

219
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:37,924
I heard there was a third level
to the plant. Is that true?

220
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:41,498
Yeah, yeah. That's where we do
the alien autopsies.

221
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,397
-I think we'd better get started.
-Don't encourage him.

222
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,333
This way, everybody.

223
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,440
All right, people,
let's stay together.

224
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:20,229
No. No. No!

225
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:23,375
This can't be. This can't be.
This can't be.

226
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,840
This can't be happening.

227
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,179
Where is it?

228
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,511
Where is it?

229
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,351
Where's the elevator?

230
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:44,623
Watch out for these babies.
260 degrees, they get hot.

231
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:47,562
All right, stay together, please.

232
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:59,140
This is it.
The plant's mission control.

233
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:04,278
100,000 tons of animal waste
to process here every year.

234
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,216
Trust me.
The results can be pretty explosive.

235
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:13,791
So if any of you had beans for lunch,
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

236
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,820
Among his peers,
he's considered witty.

237
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,359
Where's Clark?

238
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:25,796
What the heck? Excuse me.

239
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,473
Don't move!

240
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,272
Take me to Level 3.

241
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,610
-Dad.
-Now!

242
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:48,253
When we send our kids
on a field trip...

243
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:52,056
...we'd like to believe
that they're gonna be safe.

244
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,762
Lex Luthor!

245
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,777
Let these two in, just these two.

246
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,574
We'll check on
Derrick and Jeff for you.

247
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:10,976
What's going on here?

248
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,745
There's a lunatic inside demanding to
be taken to some place called Level 3.

249
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,946
We've evacuated the plant,
but he's taken the students hostage.

250
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,523
-Is anyone hurt?
-Not yet.

251
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:23,457
-What's his name?
-Earl Jenkins.

252
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,124
I know Earl Jenkins.
He used to work for us.

253
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,665
Well, what's he doing in my plant?

254
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:33,430
He claims that LuthorCorp is doing
some crop experiments...

255
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:36,097
...on some secret Level 3,
and that's what made him sick.

256
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:39,335
He's convinced it's the only place
he can get a cure.

257
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:43,242
We've got a serious problem
because there is no Level 3.

258
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,780
Where's Clark?

259
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,977
I swear, I don't know anything
about Level 3.

260
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,946
-You're lying.
-He's not lying!

261
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:25,380
I found these blueprints.
There is no Level 3.

262
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:48,812
Every night, I go down to Level 2...

263
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:52,678
...follow the red pipes
down that long hallway...

264
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,953
...go to the door, I open it...

265
00:25:56,121 --> 00:26:00,387
...and I take the elevator down
to Level 3!

266
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:06,756
You're just like everybody else.

267
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,958
Get over there and you sit down!

268
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,858
Who's that?

269
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,421
My father.

270
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:48,132
-Mr. Luthor, we have a hostage situation.
-I was briefed on my way down.

271
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,772
Lex!

272
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,967
-How did you allow this to happen?
-I didn't allow--

273
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,306
-Then how did this man get inside?
-I think--

274
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:59,247
-You think? Why don't you know?
-Can we focus on what's important?

275
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:02,785
-We've got innocent kids in there.
-This is Jonathan Kent.

276
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:06,220
It's been a long time,
but I never forget a face.

277
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:10,152
Kent's son is inside.
They know the gunman personally.

278
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,559
What's your assessment
of this lunatic?

279
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,460
He's sick, he's desperate...

280
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,727
...and he blames your plant
for his condition.

281
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,163
This Level 3 nonsense....

282
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:25,373
I've assured everyone there is
no Level 3. That is the truth, isn't it?

283
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:27,302
Of course, it is.

284
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:32,479
People's lives are at stake.
What will you do about it?

285
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,881
I'm going to let SWAT
do their job.

286
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,920
When he makes a mistake,
they'll move in.

287
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:39,918
What about the kids?

288
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,788
You need to get on the phone
and talk to him!

289
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,521
Mrs. Kent, I understand how you feel.

290
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:48,188
I want everyone to walk out
of there alive too.

291
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:52,201
-But I do not negotiate with terrorists.
-He's not a terrorist!

292
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,362
He's sick and he needs help!

293
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,941
If you won't talk to him,
then Jonathan will!

294
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:00,339
You're not the one he blames.

295
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:02,208
Is he, Dad?

296
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:09,084
<i>Gabe, it's Luthor.</i>

297
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,119
Lionel Luthor.

298
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,690
Speaker.

299
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:18,923
Mr. Luthor.

300
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,256
I've finally got your attention,
haven't I?

301
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:26,564
Earl, why don't you come out?
We've got a lot to talk about.

302
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,034
Just tell me what you were
using down on Level 3.

303
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,837
You're sick, Earl.

304
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,208
<i>Let everyone go,
we'll get you help.</i>

305
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,321
-Clark!
-Are you okay?

306
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:51,995
Oh, no.

307
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:56,564
See what you made me do?
See what you made me--?

308
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,733
<i>See what you made me do?</i>

309
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,636
Way to go, Dad.
I see you haven't lost your touch.

310
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:12,079
The methane gas valve just broke.
The whole place is gonna go up.

311
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,879
-We need to do something.
-That's not a good idea.

312
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:19,615
The man's nuts. He's not listening
to the cops, and that gas is gonna blow.

313
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,885
-He's sick, but still strong.
-I don't want you to get hurt.

314
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,928
I'm not putting my life
in that man's hands.

315
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,363
The two of us can take him.
How about it, Clark?

316
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,304
I can't.

317
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,005
It's okay.

318
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:45,076
Whitney.

319
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:49,142
<i>I trusted you. You told me you
were trying to help people.</i>

320
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,049
What are you doing?

321
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,558
Get back!

322
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,754
<i>It's all your fault, Luthor.</i>

323
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,862
We've got shots fired,
one hostage down. Full alert.

324
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,264
What was he thinking?

325
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:08,838
He's a teenager who's been waiting
for someone to take the initiative.

326
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,407
There's a hostage situation
and a potential bomb.

327
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:15,239
-Somebody's gotta do something.
-You're right. I'm going in.

328
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:19,077
Lex, don't be foolhardy.
This is no time for mock-heroics.

329
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:21,515
You said this is my plant.
It's my call.

330
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:23,951
I won't allow it, Lex.

331
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,317
Don't ever do that again.

332
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,823
Take your positions.

333
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:30,995
Tell him Lex Luthor's coming
to see him.

334
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,791
-I wouldn't advise that, sir.
-Make the call.

335
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,695
Give me your vest.

336
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:53,683
What kind of man sends his own kid
to do his dirty work?

337
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:58,448
I'm not doing anybody's dirty work.
This is my plant.

338
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:02,020
-How is he?
-He needs a doctor.

339
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:07,224
What are we gonna do
about these kids, Earl?

340
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,029
I never meant to hurt anybody.

341
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,194
I tried talking to your father,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

342
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,363
I know the feeling.

343
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,613
Earl...

344
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,882
...you say that everybody's
been lying to you.

345
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,419
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

346
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,887
My father doesn't care about you.

347
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,288
He doesn't care about anybody
in this room.

348
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,226
Because if we all die,
his PR firm will spin it.

349
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,561
His insurance company will pay,
and you will go down as the bad guy.

350
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:47,334
I'm not the bad guy.
I'm just trying to get better.

351
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:50,634
How are you gonna get better
by killing a bunch of kids?

352
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:56,881
If you let everybody go,
I'll take you to Level 3.

353
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:02,381
You stop lying.

354
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:05,821
Let them go,
and I'll show you where it is.

355
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:10,419
Earl, trust me. I'm a man of my word.

356
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:14,793
Get out.

357
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:20,065
Get out. Get out! Everybody, get out!

358
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:31,179
-Do you really know where it is?
-Yeah, it's in his imagination.

359
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:34,546
There is no Level 3, Clark.
Now, get out of here.

360
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,422
Clark.

361
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,658
Come on.
Come on, man, let's go!

362
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:50,191
-Come on, keep moving!
-This way, kids. This way.

363
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,061
The kids are coming out.

364
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:55,729
-Oh, Jonathan!
-Come on. They'll come out over here.

365
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:59,206
We need to bring down the fire doors.
The gas levels are too high.

366
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:02,938
Your son will be sealed inside.
I'm sorry, sir.

367
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,677
Do it.

368
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:17,960
-Come on, man, we gotta go!
-Don't worry about me!

369
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,037
-Pete.
-Whitney, did you see Clark?

370
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:30,606
Hey, Pete.
Where's Clark?

371
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:35,474
He's back inside, Mrs. Kent.
I tried to stop him. I'm sorry--

372
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,011
You have to open the doors.

373
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:41,613
They're safety locked and can't be
opened until the gas levels go down.

374
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,346
My son is still in there!

375
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,521
So is mine.

376
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:20,614
We're running out of time.

377
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:25,491
All right, I've done my part.
Now it's time for you to do yours.

378
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:29,430
Earl, there is no Level 3.
It's all in your head.

379
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:37,705
I should have never trusted you.
You Luthors are all the same.

380
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:44,009
<i>I found Level 3. They built a wall in front
of the elevator, but it's still here.</i>

381
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:47,709
-Stop playing with me!
-Get out of the building, Clark!

382
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:51,947
<i>Earl, it's here!
Don't you want to see it? I promise.</i>

383
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,555
Come on, I want you to see the truth.

384
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,090
Come on.

385
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,332
Come on, come on!

386
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,249
-Sir.
-Hold on.

387
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:22,181
The gas pressure is beginning to drop.

388
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:25,923
-How did that happen?
-I have no idea.

389
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:37,661
Son of a bitch!
How do you explain that?

390
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,801
I can't.

391
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:58,116
Two buttons. Two levels.
I'm sorry, all right?

392
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:22,642
I told you it was here.

393
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:29,977
Where is it?

394
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:33,457
Where is everything?
There used to be a--

395
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,821
It was a field of corn
with sprayers all over it.

396
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:41,193
And every night,
they'd spray this green mist on it.

397
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,260
What have you done with it?

398
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,036
What have you done with it?!

399
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,432
I don't know.

400
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,773
They lied to me too, Earl.

401
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,804
I had no idea this was here.

402
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,709
Earl!

403
00:36:57,015 --> 00:37:00,178
Let's go back upstairs
and talk about this.

404
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:05,483
It's all gone. How am I gonna get better
if I don't know what poisoned me?

405
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:09,058
I didn't know about this place.
You gotta believe me.

406
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,993
-I believe you, Lex.
-He's lying! He's just like his father!

407
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:37,817
Clark!

408
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,569
No! Oh, God!

409
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,468
Clark!

410
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,135
Get to the elevator!

411
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,763
Clark, how did you pull us up?

412
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,201
I don't know.

413
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,341
Adrenaline, I guess.

414
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:58,024
I've never been so happy
to see you in my life!

415
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,496
-You lied to me.
-No. When?

416
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:06,865
I said Level 3 wasn't on any plans.
It wasn't.

417
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:10,132
-It's plausible deniability.
-What were you doing down there?

418
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:14,142
It doesn't matter. It was a failure.
We closed the door and moved on.

419
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:17,839
-You almost got me killed.
-No, you almost got yourself killed.

420
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:19,813
It was your call, remember?

421
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,645
-Mr. Luthor!
-I'll handle this.

422
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,650
What can you tell us about Level 3?

423
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:28,815
I think you're referring to a redundant
storage area at the base of the plant.

424
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:33,926
Mr. Jenkins is a very sick man who
desperately needs medical attention.

425
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,998
That's why my father
and I have pledged...

426
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:39,330
...to find Mr. Jenkins
the best medical care possible.

427
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:40,994
He was a LuthorCorp employee.

428
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:46,337
Here at LuthorCorp, we always put
family first. Isn't that right, Dad?

429
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:49,378
Is it true the government is
going to shut you down?

430
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:54,177
No more questions, please. My son
has been through quite an ordeal today.

431
