1
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,425
Scientists are calling today's impact...

2
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:30,222
...one of the most significant
astronomical events of the last century.

3
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:34,128
The enormous solar flare
has already caused power surges....

4
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,961
Clark!

5
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,002
Hey, Clark. Son, you wanna
give us a hand here?

6
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:42,141
Yeah. Sorry, I must've got sucked in.

7
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,606
You caught me in the middle
of this news special.

8
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,439
What's the topic?

9
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:49,104
Solar flares and the effects
on Earth's atmosphere.

10
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:52,080
According to NASA, the sun took
a direct hit from a comet...

11
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,413
...causing one of the biggest
solar flares ever.

12
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,715
-You sound intrigued.
-Actually, it's a relief to be researching...

13
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,019
...a cosmic disaster that has
nothing to do with me.

14
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,896
I gotta go. I told Pete I'd meet him
at the Talon to swap notes.

15
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,193
-You need a ride?
-No, I think I'll run it.

16
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,165
-Bye.
-Bye.

17
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:14,466
--precipitates huge explosions
with powerful, far-reached effects.

18
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,041
The shock wave from this type
of CME is so strong...

19
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,943
...that it smashes the Earth 's magnetic
field, unleashing a geomagnetic storm.

20
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,379
In layman 's terms,
people should expect....

21
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:27,850
Do you believe that there are powers
greater than we can know...

22
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,080
...somewhere in the universe?

23
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,780
Sure.

24
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,022
Look, do you mind if I switch
back to the game?

25
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:45,962
That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for the Metropolis Sharks.

26
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,541
To Littleville, Kansas...

27
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,145
...and all the little "Kans-ass-ians" in it.

28
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,184
-One more.
-Look, pal, we don't want any trouble here.

29
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,685
I think you might have had enough.

30
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:07,523
If you want trouble,
you just try cutting me off.

31
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,301
Don't come back.

32
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,069
Small-town friendly, my butt.

33
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,087
No-- Yeah--

34
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,349
No, I'll find it.

35
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,459
Yeah, I know. This--

36
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,223
Yeah. No. No, I have not been drinking.

37
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,365
Thank you for caring.

38
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:32,872
You okay?

39
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:37,073
You pulled the door right off the car
with your bare hands?

40
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,653
-You walked right through the power lines.
-You're a little drunk, Mr....

41
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,481
White.

42
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,853
Perry White.

43
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,245
-Take it easy, Clark.
-I misjudged my strength.

44
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,386
I just got off the phone
with the hospital.

45
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:23,351
It seems your Mr. Perry White
checked himself out last night.

46
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,320
His Breathalyzer was off the charts.

47
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,825
-What do you think he saw, son?
-He probably doesn't remember my name.

48
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,960
Clark! Clark Kent!

49
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,029
Thank you.

50
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,473
Yeah.

51
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,875
Last time I saw you,
you were Frisbee-ing the door...

52
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,308
...off my car and ignoring
the high-voltage lines.

53
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,742
Mr. White.

54
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:52,874
I was trying to figure out which of the four
Clarks to thank when they hauled me off.

55
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,815
-You must be Mr. Kent.
-Yes, I am.

56
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,423
-I'm certainly glad you're feeling better.
-Well, that's relative.

57
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,081
My car is crunched.

58
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:05,287
This hillbilly cartoon you have as a sheriff
has suspended my license on a DUl...

59
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,093
...and my assignment editor is
screaming for my head.

60
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,859
You're a reporter?

61
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,263
In a past life.

62
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,799
At the moment,
I'm the advance man for X-Styles...

63
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,603
...cable TV's one stop
for the paranormally inclined.

64
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,370
What brings you here to Smallville?

65
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,946
I'm researching a piece
about the meteor shower...

66
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,812
...and the bizarre phenomena
that it spawned.

67
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:30,354
-Don't tell me you believe any of that.
-It's right up there with the tooth fairy.

68
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,995
Don't you need tools for a job like that?

69
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,067
Mr. White, you really didn't come
all this way just to thank me, did you?

70
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,065
No, I didn't. I thought
we should discuss a settlement.

71
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,143
-Settlement?
-I didn't off-road my car for laughs.

72
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,404
I swerved to miss your son.

73
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,014
Look, I'll make this easy on you.
I need a local...

74
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:02,211
...who knows the territory
to ferry me around.

75
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:05,653
You loan me Clark for a couple days,
we'll call it even.

76
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:17,626
My father went for historical accuracy
when he had the mansion reconstructed...

77
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:21,205
...but I was thinking of taking
some liberties with the decor.

78
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:25,276
Move away from the artifacts
and period pieces...

79
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,470
...and go with something more modern.

80
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,808
Even abstract.

81
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,083
Any thoughts, doctor?

82
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,948
Only that I hoped today's session
would be more productive.

83
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,654
I believe the psychological term...

84
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:42,420
...for refusing to accept
the inevitable is "denial."

85
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:46,224
And no amount of probing can uncover
emotional issues that don't exist.

86
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,426
-Now who's in denial?
-Trust me, I have nothing to hide.

87
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,699
Then tell me about the island.

88
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:58,537
The fisherman who found you said you
were raving about some imaginary enemy.

89
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,645
I was ill, suffering from malaria.

90
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:05,773
I saw your blood work, Lex.
There was no trace of disease.

91
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,612
But even some fictitious illness
would not explain your reluctance...

92
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,725
...to discuss your conflicted feelings
towards your father. Until we understand--

93
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:17,829
What I understand, doctor,
is that LuthorCorp's insurance carrier...

94
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,990
...insisted that I submit to five
psychiatric therapy sessions.

95
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,931
So I've submitted.

96
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:31,737
And sadly, our final hour is up.

97
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,271
I'll miss our sessions.

98
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,600
Two meteor craters?
You don't wanna see anything else?

99
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,703
Well, blown-out buildings and sinkholes
are background, Clark.

100
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,568
I'm looking for substance, texture...

101
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,404
...the human dimension.

102
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,576
Clark, is everything all right?

103
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,375
Pete waited for you until
after 1 0:00 last night.

104
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,815
-It's a long story.
-Hi. Perry White.

105
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:18,150
I'd like a triple cappuccino and a couple
of those glazed crullers...

106
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:21,157
...and an interview...

107
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,358
...with Smallville's very own cover girl.

108
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,625
What are you doing?

109
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,564
It's called getting the story.

110
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,332
Nothing fancy, Miss Lang,
just a simple q and a.

111
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:40,644
You know, how's Little Miss Meteor coping
1 4 years after the big bang?

112
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:46,147
Maybe this is a joke to you,
but my parents died that day.

113
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,549
And I'm sorry,
but that makes you newsworthy.

114
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,816
That's it. You're leaving.

115
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,858
Either she talks to me now,
or she faces the cameras in the morning.

116
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,428
-Clark, I can't believe you're with this guy.
-Lana.

117
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,964
Maybe you should both leave.

118
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,533
You didn't tell me Lana was
part of your agenda.

119
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,695
You didn't tell me you knew her.

120
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,705
Sorry if I hurt her feelings,
but she's a legitimate source.

121
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,968
-She's not anymore.
-lt doesn't work that way.

122
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,612
I still have to find faces
to put on camera.

123
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,511
Your high school paper has developed
quite a rep in the bug-eyed monster circles.

124
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,845
Why would you say that?

125
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:25,518
Because I did, like, three minutes
of research before I came to town.

126
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,558
Think the editor would know something
about the meteor shower?

127
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,457
How would I know?

128
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,699
"' Principal Authorizes New Gym Mats'
by Clark Kent."

129
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,635
I know I was riveted.

130
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,334
I think we should go.

131
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:50,004
Boy, I thought our stuff was off-the-wall.
This is incredible.

132
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,116
It's also all true.

133
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:55,082
Chloe, Mr. White is interested
in the meteor shower.

134
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,848
-I thought he could take a look.
-I have nothing to hide.

135
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:02,427
Oh, good. I think we've already borrowed
two or three of your ideas for our show.

136
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:06,656
Now, do you make it all up yourself,
or do you pull in other writers?

137
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:12,229
-Excuse me?
-Oh, just professional curiosity.

138
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,465
It's rare that I meet another journalist
interested in the bizarre.

139
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,075
-X-Styles?
-Yeah.

140
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:22,476
I have a penchant for the truth, something
your TV show gave up around episode two.

141
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,878
That's it. We're done.

142
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,982
Wait, wait, wait.

143
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,683
You're the Perry White?

144
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,358
It's okay. I'm gonna hoof it
back to the motel.

145
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,161
You young lovers patch things up...

146
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,566
...and then later on you can swing by,
and we'll pick up the tour.

147
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,137
Clark, do you have any idea
who that was?

148
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,289
Lex.

149
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:20,035
-I'm sorry. I'm interrupting.
-No.

150
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,136
It's strange.

151
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,402
When I was on the island,
I came to hate the roar of the ocean.

152
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:29,578
Since coming back, I find
it's the only thing that relaxes me.

153
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,543
You must think about what happened
every day.

154
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,987
And I'm sure you didn't come
all this way to discuss that.

155
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,757
What did you wanna see me about?

156
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:47,230
This tabloid television reporter
came by the Talon today...

157
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,335
...and he wanted to do an interview
with me about the meteor shower.

158
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,198
A succinct "no comment"
didn't dissuade him?

159
00:12:55,407 --> 00:13:00,344
Not really. He said he'd come back
tomorrow, this time with a camera crew.

160
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,340
And you don't want that.

161
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:06,978
I've spent the last 1 4 years
trying to put that day behind me.

162
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,713
And in an instant...

163
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,447
...he brought it all back.

164
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,551
I know it's a lot to ask...

165
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:21,031
...but I was hoping that you might
be able to do something.

166
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,032
I'm surprised you didn't go
to Clark with this.

167
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,269
Clark's with him.

168
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,140
So you want me to run him out of town?

169
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,481
I want him to stop.

170
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,851
He must've been very persistent.

171
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:46,287
-What was his name?
-Perry White.

172
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,556
I'll make sure he never bothers you again.

173
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,370
Mr. White, I've been looking for you.

174
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,199
And here I am.

175
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:08,312
You may have the makings
of a reporter yet, Kent.

176
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,107
Like you used to be?

177
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,116
Chloe and I did some checking
after you left.

178
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:19,288
Memories fade,
but a Google search never forgets.

179
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,790
And another drink isn't gonna
erase the fact...

180
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,692
...that you used to be one of the best
reporters in Metropolis.

181
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,464
What happened?

182
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,392
Life is a journey, grasshopper.

183
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,869
And sometimes the trip is smoother
with a little lubricant.

184
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,469
What's it to you, anyway?

185
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,513
Maybe it's the journalist in me...

186
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:46,515
...or that I realized, if you have a gift,
you shouldn't turn your back on it.

187
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,483
I made exactly two mistakes
in my life, kid.

188
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,126
The first was getting into journalism.

189
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:59,658
-What was the second?
-Thinking it mattered.

190
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:04,200
-One more.
-No, he's had enough.

191
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,297
I don't get you, kid.

192
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,068
I strong-armed your parents,
picked on your girlfriend...

193
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,870
...and ticked off your lady editor.

194
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,775
Still, here you are,
trying to play the hero.

195
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:19,577
Sometimes Clark's faith in his fellow
man outweighs his common sense.

196
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,984
Lex?

197
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,655
It's all right, Clark.
I'll deal with Mr. White from here.

198
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,817
I may have underestimated you, kid.

199
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,164
Clark doesn't have anything
to do with this.

200
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:37,200
Look, if this is your old man's idea, tell him
I got the message back in Metropolis.

201
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:40,805
-I have no intention of revisiting the past.
-This isn't about my father.

202
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:44,465
-It's about you.
-Lex, don't you think you're overreacting?

203
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:48,636
Considering the way he went after Lana,
I thought you'd admire my restrain.

204
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,247
-Let's go.
-Thanks for the ride, kid.

205
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:22,607
You know, this "get out of Dodge" routine
is pretty heavy-handed, even for a Luthor.

206
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,978
So is ambushing a teenage girl
for a sound bite.

207
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,120
Of course, using people
always came easy to you.

208
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,280
You know, our one and only
encounter was years ago.

209
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,227
Even in boarding school,
I was good at sniffing out reporters...

210
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,728
...but you played the "just a friendly
conversation" card very well.

211
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,296
As I recall, it was a full 1 0 minutes
before I told you to go to hell.

212
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:47,001
I was just doing my job,
and you were a legitimate source.

213
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,107
I was 1 6, and you were scrounging
for dirt on my father.

214
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,908
That's what this is really about, isn't it?

215
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,670
Your father's secrets?

216
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:59,347
If you really had anything on him,
it would've come out then.

217
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,783
If you actually believe that,
I almost feel sorry for you.

218
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,117
Just make sure you're on the 4:00 bus.

219
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:30,113
Well, so much for not drinking before 5.

220
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,507
Hey, Dad.

221
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,242
Hey.

222
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,980
Hey, Clark.
I wasn't expecting you till later.

223
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,624
-Where's Mr. White?
-He left.

224
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:43,523
I think he realized that Smallville wasn't
quite as friendly as he first thought.

225
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:46,731
I've been trying to wrestle this thing
up on a block for an hour.

226
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,867
-You wanna give me a hand?
-Sure.

227
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,677
What's the matter?

228
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,314
I don't know.
It's like I've lost all my strength.

229
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,586
Why don't you give it one more try.

230
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,917
Mr. Kent.

231
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,917
You wanna tell me how your tractor
wound up scattered...

232
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:24,187
-...over two lanes of county blacktop?
-Yeah.

233
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:28,356
We were pulling up to the farm, and we saw
somebody had put it on a flatbed.

234
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,867
-So you're saying someone was stealing it?
-I tried to follow them.

235
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,301
By the time I got here,
it must've fallen off.

236
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,532
I'm telling you, it fell out of the sky.

237
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:42,145
And last night, you were begging the nurses
to keep the flying monkeys out of your room.

238
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,249
Kid, you're saying you had nothing
to do with this?

239
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,584
To be honest, sheriff,
I'm not sure what happened.

240
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,752
Well, he's hiding something, chief.

241
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,383
Mr. White.

242
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,659
There's another bus in about an hour.

243
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:03,233
I suggest you catch it.
And don't call me "chief."

244
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,374
I'm really sorry about the tractor.
It's a total loss.

245
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,510
Clark, I'm not concerned
about the tractor.

246
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,646
Whatever's going on with your abilities...

247
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:18,544
...our family's wound up smack dab
in the middle of Perry White's radar.

248
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,953
Wise decision coming inside.

249
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:35,498
Weather service expects a shower of
threshing machines followed by combines.

250
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,862
Guess I deserve that.

251
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,796
If you tell me what you're looking for,
I'm sure I could help you find it.

252
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,038
Now, why would you wanna do that?

253
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,308
Because you were once the kind
of reporter that I would like to be.

254
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:54,249
Though I'm curious how one goes
from multiple Pulitzer nominations...

255
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,614
...to walking the Bigfoot beat.

256
00:20:56,788 --> 00:21:00,485
You know the thing that's worse than
never landing that story of a lifetime?

257
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,820
-What?
-Having it...

258
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,963
...and being afraid to write it.

259
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:10,224
Perry "The Pit Bull" White
backing off a story?

260
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,835
That's hard to believe.

261
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,973
Well, Lionel Luthor can be
remarkably persuasive.

262
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:22,371
Are you saying he had something
to do with your career slide?

263
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:27,818
Let's just say that not everyone respects
good investigative journalism...

264
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:31,888
...especially when it treads on the toes
of the rich and vengeful.

265
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,559
Isn't that the Kent farm?

266
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,528
Good eye.

267
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,735
The police chalked it up to hyperactive
frat boys going crop circles on the barn.

268
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,103
Why?

269
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,307
Call it professional interest.

270
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,411
Your friend Clark intrigues me.

271
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,321
You've thrown some Hail Marys,
but to think your problems have to do...

272
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,426
...with a solar flare? It's a stretch.

273
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:13,223
I know, Dad, but my powers started
to glitch when the comet impacted.

274
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:16,367
-Maybe there's a connection.
-Make that "probably."

275
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:17,900
-Did you find something?
-Yes.

276
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,436
Yesterday's cosmic fender-bender...

277
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,869
...produced the largest solar flare
ever recorded.

278
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,771
I'm talking communication glitches,
power surges--

279
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,536
That's what's been happening to me.

280
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,273
One second I'm helpless,
and the next, I'm in overdrive.

281
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,907
Well, we always have wondered
about the source of your abilities.

282
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:39,047
Maybe my strength and my speed, all the
things I can do, they come from the sun.

283
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,954
It's like you're some sort of walking
solar battery.

284
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:45,995
According to this, the effects of the solar
flare ought to be done by tomorrow night.

285
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,995
Maybe your accidents are gonna stop.

286
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,734
As long as I don't use my abilities till then,
we should be okay?

287
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,602
Hey, Clark. I thought I'd give you
a heads-up.

288
00:22:56,775 --> 00:23:00,677
-Our resident ghostbuster is still on the job.
-Perry White?

289
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,739
-I thought he went back to Metropolis.
-Evidently, he had a change of heart.

290
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:09,546
And he seems to be especially
interested in you, Clark.

291
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,082
What the hell are you trying to do?

292
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,660
-Lex, calm down.
-Why?

293
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,354
You've already made up your mind
about my mental state.

294
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,660
You're refusing to sign off
on my psychological release.

295
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:28,033
You're recommending even more sessions
to be continued on an indefinite basis?

296
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:32,108
I have an ethical obligation
to report my conclusions honestly.

297
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:35,644
Or maybe the nothing shrink
from Metropolis wanted more face time...

298
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:39,113
...with her celebrity patient.
You must be loving this.

299
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,275
I took no pleasure in my recommendation.

300
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,889
-Then how do you explain it?
-I think you need help, Lex.

301
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:49,353
Between the island, your failed marriage
and everything that's happened since...

302
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:53,965
...you have experienced incredible
emotional and physical trauma.

303
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,362
And your prescription's
more time on the couch?

304
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:59,197
We just spent five sessions
exploring my psyche.

305
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:02,363
No, we spent five hours discussing
your art collection...

306
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,509
...your fascination with expensive cars...

307
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:09,272
...everything except the most
traumatic moments of your life.

308
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,576
Lex, if you don't let your demons out,
they could consume you.

309
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:16,312
-We've been over this, doctor.
-We haven't even scratched the surface.

310
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:19,048
This control-freak thing
might fool your father...

311
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:22,318
...but did you really think
you could snow me?

312
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,655
-Lex, please--
-Get out.

313
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,864
Get out!

314
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,839
Morning, Clark.

315
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,306
-What are you doing here?
-You inspired me.

316
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,078
If you've got a gift,
you should use it, remember?

317
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,050
-You're drunk.
-Maybe.

318
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:53,953
Nonetheless, I finally found my story.

319
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,461
For some insane reason, it's me.

320
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,325
-Chloe told me. I don't think it's funny.
-It's not a joke.

321
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,865
I got the facts to back it up.

322
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:06,231
-What kind of facts are those?
-The accident, the power lines...

323
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:09,771
...your magical appearance as your
family's tractor drops out of the sky.

324
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:13,274
-I explained that.
-"lt fell off a truck."

325
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:16,437
That's not an explanation,
that's a punch line.

326
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:21,279
I spent the morning combing through
police records and newspaper stories.

327
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:25,787
You're Johnny-on-the-spot, Clark.
You're Smallville's own hero on deck.

328
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:28,926
Trust me, Mr. White,
there's nothing special about me.

329
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,789
Oh, that's where you're wrong, kid.

330
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:35,058
So far, I got you pegged as really strong
and shock-resistant.

331
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:38,066
Question is, what other tricks
have you got up your sleeve?

332
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:42,004
Clark! Clark, could you give me a hand?

333
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,198
I've gotta go.

334
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:47,741
I've been stonewalled
by the best of them!

335
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,739
You can run, but you...

336
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:59,018
...can't hide.

337
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,371
-Clark, you all right, son?
-It's been a weird day.

338
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:20,477
-My light-speed gave out around Lake Tahoe.
-That's gotta be 1 000 miles.

339
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:24,206
I know. One second I'm racing across
the country, the next, I can barely jog.

340
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:28,182
I tried to make it home, my super-speed
gave out again around Colorado Springs.

341
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,344
I barely had enough money
for a bus ticket.

342
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:33,218
This thing's getting
way out of control, Clark.

343
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,820
Don't worry. I'm glued to the couch
until this solar flare passes.

344
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,488
I'm afraid it's not gonna be
that easy, son.

345
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,396
Perry White saw you disappear.

346
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:48,562
Now, your mother got him off the farm,
but I don't think he's gonna give up.

347
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,067
Not that easy, anyway.

348
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,509
When they told me you were at the gate,
I could hardly believe it.

349
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:04,018
Yeah, you and me both.

350
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:07,249
-I just thought we should talk.
-We have nothing to talk about.

351
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,622
Oh, sorry to hear that.

352
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,889
Now I guess you'll never find out
what I have on your father.

353
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,301
If it's personal, I don't care.

354
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:21,235
If it's legal, the statute of limitations
must've passed long ago.

355
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,670
That depends.

356
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,946
If this information is so damning...

357
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:32,277
...why did my father stop at simply
destroying your career?

358
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:38,121
Multiple copies plus multiple attorneys
all with, in the event of my death...

359
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:41,349
...instructions to disseminate--
Well, you do the math.

360
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,752
It's all yours.

361
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,791
I just want one thing in return.

362
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:50,958
-What did you have in mind?
-Everything you know about Clark Kent.

363
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:55,470
-Clark?
-Yeah.

364
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,098
Two years ago, you drove
your Porsche off a bridge.

365
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,642
I went over the police photos.

366
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,076
There's no way you could've
survived that crash...

367
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:06,149
...without the miracle that is Clark Kent.

368
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:11,678
Imagine my surprise when I discovered you'd
actually cultivated a friendship with this kid.

369
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,116
So now you're going after Clark.

370
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,783
This is a new low, even for you.

371
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:20,419
The Lex I knew wouldn't shake your hand
without an ulterior motive.

372
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,327
You must have something.

373
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,367
Give it to me,
and I'll deliver you a story...

374
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:29,871
...that'll bring new meaning to the phrase,
"sins of the father."

375
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,776
You may have been able to neutralize
my father, but not me!

376
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:37,779
-Looks like the jungle living took a toll.
-I'm warning you...

377
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:40,679
...stay away from me
and stay away from my friends.

378
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,082
Trust me, there won't be
any blood on my hands...

379
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:45,814
...when they find what's left of you.

380
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,312
Clark, I never thought you'd rate
your own paparazzi.

381
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:13,409
Perry White must've called in a million
favors to get a camera crew.

382
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,281
Yeah. Well, the good news is,
there's only one.

383
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,881
If this solar-flare theory's correct, then...

384
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:22,356
...your tractor-tossing days
will be over by tonight.

385
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,660
I don't believe this.

386
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,928
I can't believe this. I mean,
I feel like a prisoner in my own house.

387
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,866
I just....

388
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:36,834
Clark?

389
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,504
Pete, get down!

390
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,941
-Mom, Dad.
-Clark, wait.

391
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,747
-Jonathan, hurry.
-Son.

392
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,415
Clark, get back.

393
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:01,664
Clark.

394
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,400
-What's wrong with your hand?
-I burned it.

395
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,060
My powers, they're gone again.

396
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,638
Remember, all you have to do
is get through today.

397
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,938
And hope that I don't get another
solar-flare burst and burn the farm down.

398
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,010
Next time, I could hurt you or Mom.

399
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:19,116
And Perry White will be there
to catch the whole thing on tape.

400
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,215
Dad, I can't stay here.

401
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,099
Clark!

402
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,295
Clark, come back!

403
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:46,475
He's running. Come on. Let's go.

404
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,997
Keep it rolling! I want it all on tape.

405
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:18,802
Clark is not here. And he's not coming back
until you people are gone.

406
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,775
So why don't you just leave
my family alone.

407
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:35,418
-Come on, Clark. They're long gone.
-Thanks for doing all this, Pete.

408
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:38,323
You know I'm always up
for a little Undercover Brother.

409
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,557
So we'll camp out tonight, check in
with your parents in the morning.

410
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:57,807
"We reserve the right to refuse service
to anyone."

411
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,878
I think you'd be more comfortable
at the Wild Coyote.

412
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,850
Well, I was, until they threw me out.

413
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:07,384
Either way, I'd like you to leave.

414
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,560
Please, Miss Lang--

415
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:18,668
Sometimes I let my enthusiasm for a story
outweigh my good sense.

416
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,698
Is that your idea of an apology?

417
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:26,207
No, look. Okay. Okay, I'm a jerk.

418
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:30,541
And I've got the broken engagements
and the sleepless nights to prove it.

419
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:35,379
If your job bothers you so much,
why don't you stop?

420
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,854
Because I'm a journalist.

421
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,183
It's in my blood.

422
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,753
And sometimes you have to push
to get the truth...

423
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,193
...even when it hurts.

424
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:54,062
Well, if you're finished,
I'm gonna call you a cab.

425
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,206
It won't come.

426
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,467
It's a little issue
over nonpayment of fares.

427
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,839
-But I'll make you a deal.
-Mr. White--

428
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:05,449
I will trade permanently staying
out of your life...

429
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,345
...for a ride to the bus stop.

430
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,719
Let me get my coat.

431
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,861
Hello.

432
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,665
Lana?

433
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:32,636
What? No, don't do anything.
I'll be right there.

434
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,610
-Clark, what's going on?
-I gotta get to Saunders Gorge right now.

435
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,512
Your speed thing still out?

436
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,753
I got nothing, Pete. It's all gone.

437
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,991
Get in. I'll drive.

438
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:08,639
-Lana, you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine, but....

439
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,581
I was driving him to the bus stop,
and he pretended to be sick.

440
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,151
I pulled over, and he ran out to the
viewpoint and got out on the ledge...

441
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,380
...and said he would kill himself
unless I called you.

442
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,296
Look, Clark, be careful. He's really drunk.

443
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,629
Not unless iced tea packs a punch.

444
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:36,304
I knew you'd never show for me,
so I had to trick Lana into making the call.

445
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:39,500
-Mr. White, don't do this.
-See, the way I figure it...

446
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:43,807
...you're strong, you're shockproof,
and you're incredibly fast.

447
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,512
Plus, you're cursed
with this hero complex.

448
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:50,313
Yeah, why don't you come back down
on the deck, and we'll talk about that.

449
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:54,682
-Not until I have my story.
-Wait, Mr. White.

450
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,359
Look, you're wrong about me.

451
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:00,390
-I'm betting you'll save me, Clark.
-No, I can't save you!

452
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:04,527
Well, I guess we'll find out, huh?

453
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:27,382
Okay, fun's over. Time to unleash
those incredible powers there, Clark.

454
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,886
I don't have any powers!

455
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,298
Pete! The camping gear,
there should be a rope!

456
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,270
Okay.

457
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:47,570
-Hold on, Mr. White!
-Hurry!

458
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,080
Kid.

459
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,851
Pete, it's not gonna hold!

460
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,516
Come on!

461
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,860
-Grab the rope!
-Hang on, kid.

462
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:25,745
-Hold on!
-Hang on, kid.

463
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,012
Go!

464
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,827
Good! Keep going!

465
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:45,997
Come on!

466
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,563
Kid.

467
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,903
-Okay?
-Yeah. Hurry.

468
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:52,940
-All right.
-I can't hold on much longer.

469
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,408
Pete, get moving!

470
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,934
Here, give me your hand.

471
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,608
Oh, Clark.

472
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,904
I'm sure you understand the need
for confidentiality.

473
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:01,442
I will be revealing things that are
deeply personal, even hurtful.

474
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,309
That's the point of therapy, Lex.
To regain control...

475
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:09,579
...Iet the bad feelings go and start
recovering from the traumas of the past.

476
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:13,656
Then tomorrow. 1 0 a.m.

477
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:30,735
-Clark, breakfast is almost ready.
-Great. I'll be done in a second.

478
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,633
So you're sure everything's okay now?

479
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,408
Once the effects of the flare faded,
things went back to normal.

480
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:44,053
Including your sense of humor.

481
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,218
-Hi, Lana. This is a surprise.
-Hi, Mrs. Kent.

482
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:52,157
-I hope I didn't come at a bad time.
-No, not at all.

483
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,096
-Clark, I'll keep a plate warm for you.
-Bye.

484
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:00,870
Hey, Lana.

485
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,131
You know, I was gonna stop
by the Talon later.

486
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:07,767
Just, with all the craziness,
I didn't get a chance to thank you.

487
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,309
I still don't understand
why Mr. White thought...

488
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:13,712
...you could do all those incredible things.

489
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:16,785
But I'm glad I was able to help.

490
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,889
You know, I wasn't just talking
about the gorge.

491
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,090
Whether I meant to or not,
I helped dredge up your memories...

492
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,228
...about the meteor shower.

493
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:28,229
I wanted to thank you for forgiving me.

494
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:32,664
Well, that's part of the reason
why I came by.

495
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,401
I went to the graveyard this morning.

496
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,601
Bet your parents were happy to see you.

497
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:45,073
Suddenly, I realized I hadn't been there
for months.

498
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,140
At first, I felt guilty.

499
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:50,219
You know, like I had done
something wrong.

500
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:56,754
But then I realized that that is the last
thing they would have ever wanted for me.

501
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,790
-So, what did you tell them?
-The truth.

502
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,968
That I never meant to ignore them.

503
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,798
But...

504
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:11,399
...there's someone else in my life now.

505
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,668
Someone I really care about.

506
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:16,244
-Lana--
-Clark.

507
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,245
It's okay.

508
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:25,117
I also told them that we were
in a kind of strange place right now.

509
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,723
But I'm still hoping
that we can work it out.

510
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,957
The important thing is...

511
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,629
...they know they will always be
in my thoughts.

512
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,266
I better go.

513
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,218
Thanks again for the ride.

514
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:32,355
It's the only way I could be sure
you'd get on the bus.

515
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,082
What?

516
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,124
You really are kind of a freak,
you know that?

517
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:42,123
-Mr. White.
-I'm serious.

518
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:44,859
You try to help people,
even fools like me...

519
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:47,731
...and you never ask for anything
in return.

520
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,373
When I saw your face up there
after it was all over...

521
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:54,272
...I suddenly realized I was about
to tear down a good person.

522
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:59,075
I just couldn't believe there was
actually anyone like you out there.

523
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:01,375
Trust me, Mr. White, I'm not that good.

524
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:05,420
Well, I'm just glad nobody got hurt.

525
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:09,320
Chalk it up to hallucinations or the D.T.'s.

526
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:11,984
All I know is, I got a wake-up call.

527
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:17,566
I am exactly 1 7 hours
and five minutes sober.

528
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:21,169
Well, I'm glad some good came
out of all this.

529
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,303
-So, what's next?
-lf you found the guts to go over that cliff...

530
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:30,208
...maybe I can find the courage
to finish the one story I let go.

531
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,478
Something tells me we haven't
seen the last of Perry White.

532
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,881
Something tells me you're right.

533
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,948
Rumor has it, I still have a friend or two
on the Daily Planet.

534
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:45,958
Oh, by the way, I went over a couple more
of your Torch stories.

535
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,460
And?

536
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:51,658
Well, they're rough, and half the time,
you bury the lead.

537
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:53,996
But I see a glimmer of hope.

538
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:57,436
If you ever make it to Metropolis,
look me up. I owe you one.

539
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
