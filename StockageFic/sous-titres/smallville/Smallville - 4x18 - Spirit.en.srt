"A memory can't be erased, I know"

3
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:40,026
"Because I tried"

4
00:00:41,529 --> 00:00:44,734
"Start to feel the emptiness"

00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,619

6
00:00:49,876 --> 00:00:51,954

I... "

00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:06,641

00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:10,832

10
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,200
"If you land on your feet"

11
00:01:14,227 --> 00:01:19,151
"I hope you find a way
to make it back to me"

12
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,324
"When you come around"

13
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:26,606
"I'll be there for you"

14
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:40,456
"Start to breathe
and fake a smile"

15
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:44,223
"It's all the same
after a while I know"

16
00:01:45,303 --> 00:01:47,698
"That you are tired"

17
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,312
"Carrying the ones
you lost"

18
00:01:52,357 --> 00:01:56,466
"A picture frame with
all the thoughts, I know"

19
00:01:57,488 --> 00:02:00,021
"You hold inside"

20
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:04,901
"I hope that you can"

21
00:02:04,948 --> 00:02:08,227
"Find your way back"

22
00:02:08,274 --> 00:02:11,549
"To the place that
you belong when you"

23
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:32,042
You're all gonna pay.

24
00:02:47,437 --> 00:02:50,560
Now, that's what I call
a torch.

25
00:02:55,914 --> 00:02:57,077
Genius.

"Election of prom royalty

31
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:57,677
is an archaic and elitist ritual
whose time has come and gone. "

00:03:57,733 --> 00:03:59,212
Chloe Sullivan strikes again.

33
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:02,708
What? Oh, please don't tell me
I lost you to tiara fever, too.

34
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:07,217
No, but balloons and taffeta seem a little
harmless compared to your usual targets.

35
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:11,046
Well, this is how I see it. Homecoming
is for jocks, graduation's for parents,

36
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:13,641
and prom is the rite of passage
that's for all of us.

37
00:04:13,676 --> 00:04:16,423
It's supposed to be a culmination
of four years of memories.

38
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:20,730
Why do we have to ruin it with
the pinnacle of a popularity contest?

39
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:23,993
So does that mean I order more pizza
for the brad pitt marathon?

40
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,517
What, you're not going?
What happened with Jason?

41
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:29,417
Showing up with the coach that
got fired for dating his student...

42
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:31,833
That is an entrance
I could live without.

43
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,230
Right.

44
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:37,070
Besides, after imagining
something for four years,

45
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:39,272
I just don't think it could
live up to expectations.

46
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:42,031
Well, not if you're part
of the half-empty persuasion.

47
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:44,297
And the Lana I know
wouldn't cop out like that.

48
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:47,139
Come on, Lana,
it's gonna be so much fun.

49
00:04:47,174 --> 00:04:50,215
Lex even got Lifehouse
to play for the seniors.

50
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,808
You can help me
bring stag back in style.

51
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:55,541
Excuse me, coming through!

52
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:01,599
Smells like school spirit.

53
00:05:02,763 --> 00:05:03,679
Chloe,

54
00:05:03,702 --> 00:05:08,446
You may think bashing a sacred school
tradition in your tabloid rag is cool,

55
00:05:08,493 --> 00:05:10,548
but I think
it's disgusting.

56
00:05:12,872 --> 00:05:14,246
Lighten up, Dawn.

57
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:18,860
You'll get your throne, because this entire school
is terrified of you and your vicious rumor mill.

58
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:20,680
Kill me now.

59
00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:23,205
You are such the Hypocrat.

60
00:05:23,337 --> 00:05:24,734
Hypocr-

61
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:28,503
I'm sorry, whatever it is that you're saying
to me is getting lost in translation.

62
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,077
Don't play stupid.

63
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:33,623
The only reason you're picture's on
that wall is because of your lame article.

64
00:05:33,658 --> 00:05:34,912
What picture?

65
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:36,556
What wall?

66
00:05:41,663 --> 00:05:44,176
I would say, may the best girl win.

67
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,419
But I think we both know
who that is, hmm?

68
00:05:46,454 --> 00:05:47,816
Laters.

69
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:52,747
So apparently, I'm not the only one
who enjoyed your article...

70
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:54,073
Your Highness.

71
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:57,308
Good luck.

72
00:06:03,817 --> 00:06:05,097
Who found her?

73
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:06,060
The gardener...

74
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:09,345
He was digging a drainage ditch.
The guy'spretty shaken up.

75
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,051
How long has she been dead?

76
00:06:21,204 --> 00:06:22,355
At least a day.

77
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:26,759
Lex...

78
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,403
Oh, my god.

79
00:06:30,188 --> 00:06:31,890
Jason, what are you doing here?

80
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:33,508
I came to talk to you about some reports,

81
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:35,962
and then I saw security run out of the mansion.

82
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,531
I found this, sir. We got an I. D.

83
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:47,435
Bridgette Crosby.

84
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:48,715
I know that name.

85
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,603
I've come across it several times
in my research.

86
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:52,575
She works for Virgil Swann, the billionaire.

87
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:54,701
Look, this doesn't concern you.

88
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,035
If it has anything to do with the artifacts,
it concerns me.

89
00:06:59,097 --> 00:07:02,819
Edwards, Lyle, will you please escort Mr. Teague to his car?

90
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:18,409
Now, should I bow to you when I see you, or...

91
00:07:18,444 --> 00:07:19,806
Cute. Very cute.

92
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:22,396
What about "boycotting the vote",
didn't anyone understand?

93
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,134
Oh, they understand it perfectly.

94
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:25,684
You see, you are the boycott.

95
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:29,019
I mean, think about it. For the last four years,
everybody's been trying to break out of the stereotype

96
00:07:29,518 --> 00:07:31,053
they've been stuck in.

97
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,302
You're the battle cry.

98
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:37,138
Huh. The great smallville highprom coup, huh?

99
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:40,884
Clark, you didn't happen to have
anything to do with this, did you?

100
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,080
I may have spoken to a few people.

101
00:07:44,113 --> 00:07:47,342
Now, I know you're not gonna let me storm this bastille alone.

102
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,783
So who is Smallville's most eligible bachelor
taking to prom?

103
00:07:52,494 --> 00:07:54,587
I was actually

104
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,489
thinking of sitting this one out.

105
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:59,188
What? Oh, not you, too.

106
00:07:59,223 --> 00:08:03,001
Wait, let me guess. You spent four years
imagining what it would be like,

107
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:06,137
and you just don't think it's gonna live up
to your expectations.

108
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:08,086
Something like that.

109
00:08:08,227 --> 00:08:12,276
So you're gonna let me break out of my rut on stage,
wearing a sash,

110
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:15,223
while you're at home playing the "what if? " Game
for the 900th time.

111
00:08:15,258 --> 00:08:16,442
I never said you were in a rut.

112
00:08:16,477 --> 00:08:18,567
Yeah, but I am, and I'm not alone.

113
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:22,336
You know, Clark, in a couple of weeks,
we're gonna graduate from this adolescent fantasy,

114
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:24,931
and we're not gonna have a rut to fall back into.

115
00:08:25,085 --> 00:08:29,277
The thing about expectations, Clark,
is they're supposed to drive you to do more with your life,

116
00:08:29,312 --> 00:08:31,567
not stop you from living it.

117
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:36,498
Personally, I think the future holds a lot more
promise for you than you give it credit.

118
00:08:41,632 --> 00:08:44,943
So, 2: 00 is tanning, 3: 00 is nails,

119
00:08:44,978 --> 00:08:48,904
4: 00 is hair, and the limo picks us up at 6: 00.

120
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,403
If I were you, I'd be more concerned about 12: 00.

121
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:53,859
We don't need to start that early.

122
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:56,348
No, Dawn. 12: 00.

123
00:08:58,388 --> 00:09:01,582
Is that your boyfriend crushing on a freshman?

124
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:05,078
She is so not making
pep squad.

125
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:08,202
First off, wonder bra,

126
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,388
Laters.

127
00:09:11,325 --> 00:09:12,463
The Talon?

128
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:14,564
Hi, can you say "mortified"?

129
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:18,110
I mean, prom is only 27 hours away.

130
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:19,226
Yeah,

131
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:20,656
about that...

132
00:09:21,032 --> 00:09:22,135
I'm not going.

133
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,167
Don't be stupid.

134
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,057
Dawn, it's over.

135
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:27,196
What?

136
00:09:27,243 --> 00:09:29,190
It should've been over a long time ago.

137
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:32,712
I'm not hanging around just so that I can be
a bow tie that matches your dress.

138
00:09:32,748 --> 00:09:36,023
You can't break up with me the day before prom.

139
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:36,961
It's over.

140
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:41,305
Billy!

141
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,591
That's harsh.

142
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:47,000
Forget it.

143
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:49,360
He's so yesterday's mystery meat.

144
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:51,181
Okay.

145
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,344
Massive re-strategy.

146
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:57,116
I can't go to prom alone. I need my king.

147
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:02,654
Get me a yearbook.

148
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,011
I need me some of this!

149
00:10:17,446 --> 00:10:18,972
Genius.

150
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,552
Harmony,

151
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:25,839
check out this profile.
Okay,

152
00:10:25,863 --> 00:10:28,329
gorgeous, captain of the football team,

153
00:10:28,364 --> 00:10:30,933
and single long enough that I'm not sloppy seconds.

154
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:33,223
Get me the digits for Clark Kent.

155
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:36,170
Uh-huh...

156
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:38,647
uh-huh.

157
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:49,663
Stop! Please, stop!

158
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:54,548
Please, stop!

159
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,783
Holy crap.

160
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:14,329
I'm Clark Kent's mom.

161
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,929
Mom?

162
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:29,758
"You make me wanna la la
in the kitchen on the floor"

163
00:12:29,814 --> 00:12:31,751
"I'll be a french maid"

164
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:35,318
"When I meet you at the door
I'm like an alley cat"

165
00:12:36,651 --> 00:12:37,520
Mom!

166
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,869
What's going on?

167
00:12:41,796 --> 00:12:43,006
Hi... son.

168
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,466
What's for dinner?

169
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,356
Dinner?

170
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:51,117
Oh, right.

171
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,174
Here,

172
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,593
start with this. It's really yummy.

173
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:56,424
Are you feeling okay?

174
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,429
I'm great.

175
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:00,587
I always wanted to ask you,

176
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:03,699
do you have a date for the prom yet?

177
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:07,190
Mom, I told you I'm not going to the prom.

178
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:08,106
What?

179
00:13:08,423 --> 00:13:10,020
You have to go!

180
00:13:10,935 --> 00:13:12,145
Well, I...

181
00:13:12,415 --> 00:13:13,728
I kind of wanted to go with Lana, but...

182
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:14,972
Lana Lang?

183
00:13:16,217 --> 00:13:20,068
Oh... You can't be serious.
You two are so last year.

184
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:22,320
Clark, your prom

185
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,998
is the most memorable night of your life.

186
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,473
I am not going to let you miss it.
You can take me.

187
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:32,040
Mom, you're already going, remember, with dad?
You're chaperones.

188
00:13:32,075 --> 00:13:33,026
Oh.

189
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:35,398
Yeah. Right. Cool.

190
00:13:42,313 --> 00:13:45,225
Oh, I swear, the dog knows I'm allergic.

191
00:13:45,355 --> 00:13:47,961
He follows me around wherever I go.
He's torturing me.

192
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:51,188
So... this is your little secret.

193
00:13:51,716 --> 00:13:54,111
You're taking her to the prom, aren't you?

194
00:13:55,978 --> 00:13:57,023
Lois?

195
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:59,762
Mrs. Kent, a lot of things are possible in this world,

196
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:03,267
but there will be a man on Mars before
Clark and I go to a prom together.

197
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,477
So, what, you two just get together and mack,
but keep it on the down low in public?

198
00:14:08,512 --> 00:14:09,276
Mom!

199
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:11,660
I don't mean to be rude, Mrs. Kent,
but, uh,

200
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:13,421
did you crack open the cooking sherry?

201
00:14:13,457 --> 00:14:14,572
Of course not.

202
00:14:14,713 --> 00:14:17,202
I'm just super pumped about prom.

203
00:14:19,363 --> 00:14:20,859
Well, I'm gonna go.

204
00:14:21,646 --> 00:14:24,452
Mom, maybe I should take you to the Talon tonight.

205
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:26,013
The Talon?

206
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,127
Oh, right, I work there.

207
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:30,587
Uh, no, I'm driving myself. Laters.

208
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:35,032
"Laters"?

209
00:14:46,223 --> 00:14:48,336
I'm psyched Billy dumped Dawn.

210
00:14:48,383 --> 00:14:50,426
She was getting so stuck-up.

211
00:14:50,461 --> 00:14:53,441
I heard he already hooked up with Sue Ann Gardner.

212
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:58,464
Sue Ann Gardner is a big fat hoe.

213
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:03,396
Mrs. Kent?

214
00:15:05,075 --> 00:15:05,909
Oh.

215
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,304
Hi, Lana.

216
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,875
Shouldn't you be at school helping with the decorations?

217
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:12,247
The prom committee needs all the help they can get.

218
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:14,302
I'm not gonna go to the prom.

219
00:15:14,349 --> 00:15:16,584
Why, you think you're so above it all?

220
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:19,872
No, of course not.

221
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,091
Oh, come on.

222
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:24,698
Poor little orphan girl...

223
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:27,821
Going off to your fancy french art school,

224
00:15:28,434 --> 00:15:30,641
going out with a big college guy...

225
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,187
I don't have to listen to this.

226
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:35,303
Hey.

227
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:47,925
Genius.

228
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:52,375
Lana, have you seen my mom?

229
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:54,242
Forget about your mom, Clark.

230
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:57,365
I have been meaning to ask you something.

231
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,255
Yeah, sure, what is it?

232
00:15:59,474 --> 00:16:02,245
Well, I know thatit's kind of last-minute,

233
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:06,437
but I thought it'd be totally amazing

234
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:08,104
if we went to prom together.

235
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:09,502
Us?

236
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:13,426
Lana, what about Jason?

237
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:15,598
Clark, it's you I want to go with.

238
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:20,542
Don't you want to go with me?

239
00:16:24,271 --> 00:16:26,690
- Well, I mean, I...
- Awesome, it's a date.

240
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:28,784
I've gotta get back
to the school and help set up.

241
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:30,707
They're lost without me.

242
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:33,981
Laters.

243
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:42,511
Mom...

244
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,965
mom, are you all right?

245
00:16:46,294 --> 00:16:47,527
For the life of me,

246
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:49,981
I can't remember how I got here.

247
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:03,506
Looking great, guys.

248
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:04,961
That's perfect,

249
00:17:04,997 --> 00:17:06,793
but remember to use enough tape, okay?

250
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,652
Too much is always better than not enough.

251
00:17:12,153 --> 00:17:13,410
Gimme that.

252
00:17:14,126 --> 00:17:15,182
Harmony,

253
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:17,927
this is supposed to be cotton candy pink.

254
00:17:17,963 --> 00:17:19,689
Why is it sea foam green?

255
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:22,518
Nice Dawn Stiles impersonation.

256
00:17:22,577 --> 00:17:25,607
Yeah, you have the queen bitch control freak down-pat.

257
00:17:25,757 --> 00:17:27,530
What's that supposed to mean?

258
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:29,550
Where is Dawn, anyway?

259
00:17:29,643 --> 00:17:34,246
I have no clue, and honestly, we'll get way more done
without her ordering us around.

260
00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:42,205
See you guys tomorrow.

261
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,851
You worked up quite a sweat.

262
00:17:49,473 --> 00:17:50,460
Hey, Lana,

263
00:17:51,082 --> 00:17:53,689
I didn't expect to see you
decorating for the prom.

264
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:56,025
Well, maybe there's more to me than meets the eye.

265
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:59,160
Heard you got over Dawn Stiles pretty quick.

266
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:01,555
I couldn't stand to spend another second with her.

267
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,538
I mean, her voice... it's a little too "nail on
the chalkboard", you know what I mean?

268
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:06,814
No, I don't know what you mean!

269
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,890
But I have an idea.

270
00:18:13,518 --> 00:18:15,106
Why don't you go clean up,

271
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:16,649
and then we can hang out

272
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:18,408
and get to know each other better?

273
00:18:20,615 --> 00:18:21,848
Be right back.

274
00:18:44,184 --> 00:18:44,995
Chloe.

275
00:18:45,711 --> 00:18:47,002
Have you seen Lana?

276
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:51,790
The only people here are the school spirit club
spreading their prom-aganda. Why?

277
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:54,033
There's something going on.
My mom started to act strange.

278
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:57,661
It's like she's channeling some inner teenager,
now Lana's not acting like herself.

279
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,820
Well, if you think Lana's here decorating for the prom,

280
00:18:59,854 --> 00:19:02,192
that definitely falls into altered states.

281
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:08,658
Lana...

282
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:12,121
What are you doing in here?

283
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:16,241
Nobody breaks up with Dawn Stiles.

284
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:27,985
Clark?

285
00:19:41,008 --> 00:19:43,086
Lana, what's going on?

286
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:44,248
I don't know.

287
00:20:05,407 --> 00:20:07,309
Lana, you were just in there.

288
00:20:07,532 --> 00:20:09,235
I don't even know how I got to school.

289
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:25,071
That was Clark. He's at the hospital.

290
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:26,656
Billy's gonna make a full recovery.

291
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:27,677
Good.

292
00:20:27,818 --> 00:20:30,284
Clark said he saw me come out of that locker room.
Do you think

293
00:20:30,341 --> 00:20:32,738
I could've done anything when I was blacked out?

294
00:20:34,405 --> 00:20:36,519
Why would I ever hurt Billy Durden?

295
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:37,784
You wouldn't.

296
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,863
But Dawn Stiles would.

297
00:20:40,097 --> 00:20:42,774
Dawn? The girl most likely to be prom queen?

298
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,097
People were saying that you were acting freakishly like her,

299
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:49,254
and Clark's mom was acting very Dawn-ish
before she came back on-line at the Talon.

300
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:51,790
That's the last thing I remember before blacking out...

301
00:20:51,823 --> 00:20:53,620
talking to Martha Kent in the Talon.

302
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:57,389
And Mrs. Kent says the last thing she remembers
is driving along route 54.

303
00:20:57,424 --> 00:21:00,909
That's where they found Dawn's body
at the bottom of Carlton gorge...

304
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,739
The mother lode of all meteor rock.

305
00:21:03,774 --> 00:21:04,913
Oh, my god.

306
00:21:04,946 --> 00:21:08,245
They have her in the emergency room. She's in a deep coma.

307
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:12,226
So you think that her spirit was somehow able
to take over Martha

308
00:21:12,261 --> 00:21:14,515
and then transfer into me?

309
00:21:14,727 --> 00:21:17,004
Well, we are in Smallville,

310
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,415
and, I mean, what would the senior prom be without a

311
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,939
body-snatching prom queen?

312
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,026
Lana, are you okay?

313
00:21:32,061 --> 00:21:33,846
Yeah, I just feel really horrible.

314
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,513
I have no idea what I did.

315
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:38,496
Well, you didn't do anything.
You were inhabited by Dawn Stiles.

316
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:43,460
And the question is, now that we have
the old Lana back, where's the new Dawn?

317
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:48,391
How is she?

318
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:50,284
Well, she's barely hanging on.

319
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,619
She's got massive head injuries,
and she's severely disfigured.

320
00:21:53,654 --> 00:21:55,052
Disfigured?

321
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,569
No, it couldn't be.

322
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:02,998
That face was so perfect.

323
00:22:14,112 --> 00:22:16,307
Eww... Gross.

324
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,649
Uh, you're not allowed in here.

325
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:24,243
Really.

326
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:31,543
I'm terrified to even think what else I could've said
or done during that last hour.

327
00:22:32,165 --> 00:22:35,019
So you don't remember what you said to me at the Talon today?

328
00:22:35,277 --> 00:22:36,533
Oh, no.

329
00:22:36,968 --> 00:22:38,377
What'd I say?

330
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,206
You just, um,

331
00:22:41,696 --> 00:22:43,281
asked me to prom.

332
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:44,831
Oh.

333
00:22:45,817 --> 00:22:46,639
Really?

334
00:22:46,674 --> 00:22:49,246
It wasn't you, though, right? It was Dawn, so...

335
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:53,365
Code blue, room 256.

336
00:22:53,764 --> 00:22:56,723
Code blue, room 256.

337
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,363
Excuse me, are you friends of Dawn's?

338
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,121
Yes, what happened?

339
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:05,080
There's nothing they can do. I'm afraid she passed on.

340
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:07,311
I'm sure she didn't suffer.

341
00:23:08,215 --> 00:23:09,612
I'm sorry.

342
00:23:22,094 --> 00:23:23,047
Genius.

343
00:23:45,177 --> 00:23:47,455
Find anything interesting?

344
00:23:48,406 --> 00:23:50,132
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.

345
00:23:50,164 --> 00:23:53,308
You crossed the line, Jason.
I take my privacy very seriously.

346
00:23:53,358 --> 00:23:55,612
And I take murder very seriously.

347
00:23:55,962 --> 00:23:58,099
It says here you sent an e-mail to Bridgette Crosby.

348
00:23:58,134 --> 00:24:00,116
I never denied I knew her.

349
00:24:01,114 --> 00:24:04,554
Confirming a meeting between the two of you
here at the Luthor's mansion

350
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,711
on the same morning
she was found face-down in the dirt.

351
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:11,727
Well, Ms. Crosby never showed up for that meeting.

352
00:24:14,462 --> 00:24:16,593
You mentioned an item in your e-mail.

353
00:24:16,827 --> 00:24:19,035
I assume you're talking about an artifact.

354
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:21,465
What were you gonna do, you were gonna buy it from her,

355
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:22,955
or were you gonna take it with force?

356
00:24:23,002 --> 00:24:25,485
I don't need to explain myself to you, Jason.

357
00:24:25,522 --> 00:24:27,734
No, but you're gonna have to explain it to the police.

358
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:30,620
Look, I have no interest being in the middle
of a murder investigation

359
00:24:30,655 --> 00:24:32,287
I had nothing to do with,

360
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:34,589
not to mention the media circus that comes with it.

361
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:37,172
There was a dead body found on your property, Lex.

362
00:24:37,864 --> 00:24:39,168
It's kinda hard to ignore.

363
00:24:39,215 --> 00:24:40,894
Trust me, I'm not.

364
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,252
Who are you trying to protect...

365
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,579
You?

366
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,080
Your father?

367
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:54,594
Burying bodies in the backyard
isn't exactly a hobby of mine, Jason.

368
00:24:59,494 --> 00:25:03,063
Yeah, well, covering up a homicide
isn't exactly a hobby of mine.

369
00:25:03,592 --> 00:25:05,821
I think I'll go have a chat with the sheriff.

370
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,418
I just went to see the allergist.

371
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:22,919
This says I owe $200.

372
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:27,730
Actually, it's $215,
including lab fees.

373
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:32,274
But all they did was stick a bunch of needles in my back
and make me really itchy.

374
00:25:32,486 --> 00:25:33,601
What's that all about?

375
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:36,253
Well, they need to find out what you're allergic to.

376
00:25:36,276 --> 00:25:38,014
I know what I'm allergic to.

377
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:39,916
He's got four legs and drools.

378
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:42,088
What I need is a prescription.

379
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:43,848
Please.

380
00:25:44,012 --> 00:25:45,785
A dog's life depends on it.

381
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,378
Miss...

382
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:52,957
maybe I can help you.

383
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:07,512
Hey, you guys look great.

384
00:26:07,677 --> 00:26:11,105
Clark, the only reason we agreed to be chaperones
was because of you.

385
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,946
I know. It's a little backwards.

386
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:15,799
My parents are going to the prom,
and I'm staying home to wait up for them.

387
00:26:15,846 --> 00:26:18,816
Son, when you're older, we don't want you
to have to look back on high school

388
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,429
and regret not going to the prom.

389
00:26:20,473 --> 00:26:24,883
Dad, I'm not sure that standing by the punch bowl
and watching bad dancing is a memory I'm gonna cherish.

390
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:27,337
I wouldn't be so sure about that, Clark.

391
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:28,429
Let's go.

392
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:30,108
I'll bring the truck around.

393
00:26:34,173 --> 00:26:36,416
I think I know why you're not going tonight.

394
00:26:37,003 --> 00:26:38,541
When I was a freshman,

395
00:26:39,093 --> 00:26:42,345
I remember standing outside
and watching the seniors going into prom.

396
00:26:42,486 --> 00:26:45,399
The guys in their tuxes and the girls in their dresses.

397
00:26:46,937 --> 00:26:48,945
I guess I always thought that that would be Lana and me.

398
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,448
Oh, Clark...

399
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,264
Things don't always end up
the way you picture them, but

400
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:56,575
sometimes they can end up even better
if you give them a chance.

401
00:26:58,641 --> 00:27:01,634
If you change your mind, I put your tux by the door.

402
00:27:05,838 --> 00:27:07,282
You rented me a tux?

403
00:27:07,482 --> 00:27:08,703
Just in case.

404
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,710
Mom...

405
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:15,663
Well?

406
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,335
How do I look?

407
00:27:26,742 --> 00:27:28,327
It looks like you're going to the prom.

408
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,428
I am.

409
00:27:32,328 --> 00:27:33,784
And you're taking me.

410
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:37,105
I'm not gonna let you sit around moping all night

411
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,181
while your parents go out and do the electric boogaloo all night.

412
00:27:40,463 --> 00:27:41,602
It's gonna be fun.

413
00:27:42,753 --> 00:27:44,984
No, I-I'm not going.

414
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:47,265
Massive re-strategy.

415
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,107
You're going to your senior prom whether you like it or not.

416
00:27:50,142 --> 00:27:52,455
End of discussion.
Put on your tux.

417
00:27:54,052 --> 00:27:57,105
Lois, wasn't this not in the realm of possibilities?

418
00:27:57,187 --> 00:27:59,113
Anything's possible, Clark.

419
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:00,780
Anything.

420
00:28:05,883 --> 00:28:07,034
Over here, sheriff.

421
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,286
Wait a second.

422
00:28:11,449 --> 00:28:14,267
The body was right here, it was right next to this rock.

423
00:28:14,678 --> 00:28:16,860
They must've just built this gazebo.

424
00:28:17,025 --> 00:28:18,457
Well, according to the county records,

425
00:28:18,492 --> 00:28:21,463
the gazebo's been here since before the Luthors
even heard of Smallville.

426
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:22,811
Sheriff, I know what I saw.

427
00:28:23,163 --> 00:28:26,439
The dead and decaying body of one Bridgette Crosby.

428
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:29,678
Mr. Teague, I'll level with you. A good murder mystery
is just the kind of thing

429
00:28:29,713 --> 00:28:31,310
I could use right about now.

430
00:28:31,344 --> 00:28:33,295
The thing is, you can't have a murder without a victim.

431
00:28:33,324 --> 00:28:36,109
And, see, this Bridgette Crosby...
There's no record that she ever existed.

432
00:28:36,144 --> 00:28:38,234
This is crazy. Of course she existed.

433
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:41,478
Well, every government database from the IRS to the PTA

434
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:43,480
happens to disagree with you.

435
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:45,529
I even went on one of those Google searches.

436
00:28:45,577 --> 00:28:48,407
It kept asking meif I meant "Bing Crosby. "

437
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,356
The gardener.

438
00:28:50,391 --> 00:28:52,258
The gardener found the body.
Did you question him?

439
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:54,510
I questioned the entire landscaping staff.

440
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:58,796
It's Lex. He's paid them off,
or he's intimidating them.

441
00:28:58,819 --> 00:29:00,628
Or you're yanking my rope.

442
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:04,077
Mr. Teague, the next time you say there's been a killing,

443
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,425
I'd better see a stiff.

444
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:29,802
Hello, mother.

445
00:29:31,082 --> 00:29:32,386
Oh, it's done.

446
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,779
Lex took care of the body just like we wanted.

447
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,572
Mm-hmm.
I love you, too.

448
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:16,292
"I was young but I wasn't naive"

449
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:21,754
"I watched helpless
as you turned around to leave"

450
00:30:22,142 --> 00:30:23,938
Isn't this amazing?

451
00:30:24,396 --> 00:30:26,296
Oh, aren't you so glad you came, Clark?

452
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:28,703
We are gonna have so much fun!

453
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:31,544
Okay, Lois, you got me here.
You can stop laying it on.

454
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,593
I'm gonna go get some punch.

455
00:30:44,404 --> 00:30:49,040
"After all this time"

456
00:30:49,979 --> 00:30:52,539
"I never thought we'd be here"

457
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:55,924
"I never thought
we'd be here in my life... "

458
00:30:56,511 --> 00:30:58,167
Come on, Chloe, you can do this.

459
00:31:08,936 --> 00:31:11,895
Hey. Haven't I seen you here before?

460
00:31:12,435 --> 00:31:14,842
Well, maybe this time we won't have any natural disasters.

461
00:31:14,901 --> 00:31:17,423
I'm really surprised that you made it.

462
00:31:18,104 --> 00:31:21,274
Yeah, well, remember all those regrets we were talking about?

463
00:31:21,732 --> 00:31:24,928
Well, I think not seeing you with a crown on your head
would be at the top of the list.

464
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:31,175
I'm glad you're here.

465
00:31:32,337 --> 00:31:33,335
Clark!

466
00:31:33,688 --> 00:31:34,662
Clark!

467
00:31:35,142 --> 00:31:37,490
It's called an escort for a reason.

468
00:31:37,572 --> 00:31:39,580
And you're here...

469
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:40,989
in pink.

470
00:31:41,623 --> 00:31:42,457
Why?

471
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:45,745
I came to, uh, cheer you on, of course.

472
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:48,763
Excuse me, everybody, excuse me!

473
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,172
Thanks, guys.

474
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:53,401
If I could just get your attention
for a moment.

475
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:54,713
Thank you.

476
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,129
It is time

477
00:31:56,258 --> 00:31:57,761
for the big announcement.

478
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:01,412
Okay, if by some weird reason, I win,

479
00:32:01,449 --> 00:32:03,715
the tiara burning party is at my house.

480
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,768
Let's get closer. Come on.

481
00:32:06,956 --> 00:32:09,738
You voted, and the results are in.

482
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:13,992
This year's Smallville High prom queen is...

483
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,726
Chloe Sullivan!

484
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:33,292
Come on up here, Chloe.
Congratulations.

485
00:32:38,728 --> 00:32:39,362
Oh...

486
00:32:42,477 --> 00:32:44,157
What the hell am I doing in a dress,

487
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,977
and what the hell am I doing at your prom?

488
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,963
Oh, no.

489
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:53,493
Did you pin that on me?

490
00:32:53,728 --> 00:32:55,654
I... I'll explain later, Lois.

491
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:57,661
A little close to the boob, don't you think?

492
00:32:57,697 --> 00:32:59,857
Oh, my gosh, you guys! Thank you so much!

493
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,356
This is so totally awesome!

494
00:33:02,838 --> 00:33:06,189
I guess I could say I've looked to the stars

495
00:33:06,225 --> 00:33:09,829
and wished for this moment ever since I was a little girl.

496
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:14,455
You can dream of standing here your whole life,

497
00:33:14,737 --> 00:33:18,270
but right now, looking down on all of you...

498
00:33:18,517 --> 00:33:22,366
This is just so totally... Genius!

499
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:24,855
Thank you so much!
Although,

500
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:27,039
I just have to say

501
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,147
that the person who really deserves this honor

502
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:33,742
is Dawn Stiles.

503
00:33:36,325 --> 00:33:38,674
No, seriously, you guys. Seriously.

504
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:42,665
She gave so much of herself...
way more than Chloe Sullivan.

505
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,746
Chloe! Chloe! Chloe!

506
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,233
Anyway,

507
00:33:52,468 --> 00:33:55,098
I promise this will be one night

508
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,927
that I will always remember...

509
00:33:59,043 --> 00:34:01,025
and you will never forget.

510
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:03,922
Okay, smallville,

511
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,763
I clicked my heels together three times,
and nothing happened.

512
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:08,301
Better tell me what's going on.

513
00:34:12,603 --> 00:34:15,703
"Start to feel the emptiness"

514
00:34:15,726 --> 00:34:20,012
"and everything I'm gonna miss
I know"

515
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:19,043
Dad?

516
00:35:19,653 --> 00:35:20,933
Dad, are you okay?

517
00:35:21,297 --> 00:35:23,504
Yeah, Chloe... she's not...

518
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:27,309
She's not acting like herself.
She took off down the stairs. I-I'm fine.

519
00:35:28,656 --> 00:35:30,934
Dad, I need you to get something for me.

520
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:56,119
You're all gonna pay.

521
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,467
Now, that's what I call a torch.

522
00:36:19,341 --> 00:36:20,210
Genius.

523
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,785
How did you do that?

524
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,662
I know it's you, Dawn.

525
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:29,965
You don't want to do this.

526
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,214
All those years I kept trying to be what everyone else wanted,

527
00:36:33,249 --> 00:36:35,844
and it turns out those losers don't even care.

528
00:36:36,067 --> 00:36:38,521
This was supposed to be the best night of my life,

529
00:36:38,556 --> 00:36:40,238
and they laughed at me.

530
00:36:40,273 --> 00:36:41,964
Let Chloe go.

531
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:43,948
I will.

532
00:36:44,876 --> 00:36:47,940
See, Clark, there's a whole life after high school,

533
00:36:47,975 --> 00:36:51,894
and I can be whoever I want.

534
00:36:54,889 --> 00:36:55,898
Clark?

535
00:36:58,106 --> 00:37:00,322
The crown's mine, bitch.

536
00:37:02,835 --> 00:37:04,021
Genius.

537
00:37:11,434 --> 00:37:12,326
Dawn!

538
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,142
Seriously, Mr. Kent,

539
00:37:16,177 --> 00:37:17,633
you can't stop me.

540
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:18,925
That may be true,

541
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:20,954
but I can stop my son.

542
00:37:31,688 --> 00:37:33,038
What are you doing?

543
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,917
What is that?

544
00:37:35,574 --> 00:37:37,664
It's time for you to leave, Dawn!

545
00:38:06,332 --> 00:38:07,283
Chloe!

546
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:09,006
Chloe...

547
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:11,883
Are you okay?

548
00:38:11,965 --> 00:38:13,536
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

549
00:38:22,764 --> 00:38:24,267
I think you dropped something.

550
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:27,237
Congratulations.

551
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,259
Listen, Lois...

552
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:43,830
your parents filled me in.

553
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:46,813
Apparently, some girl named Dawn was possessing me?

554
00:38:46,848 --> 00:38:48,574
Yeah, well, that's the short version.

555
00:38:48,597 --> 00:38:51,169
Yeah, well, that's the last time I'll ever let her do my hair.

556
00:38:52,014 --> 00:38:54,061
Look, I'm sorry you got pulled into all this.

557
00:38:54,096 --> 00:38:55,212
Don't worry about it.

558
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:57,713
I never quite made it to my senior prom.

559
00:39:00,014 --> 00:39:02,456
The punch could use a little kick.

560
00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:13,770
"What day is it? "

561
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,120
"And in what month? "

562
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:20,300
"This clock never seemed so alive"

563
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:26,063
You know, I was thinking, since you did get
all dressed up and you came here with me...

564
00:39:28,646 --> 00:39:30,642
you should at least get a dance out of it.

565
00:39:30,677 --> 00:39:32,142
Chivalry noted.
But, uh,

566
00:39:32,178 --> 00:39:34,373
I'm not the one you want to dance with, Clark.

567
00:39:35,283 --> 00:39:36,281
She is.

568
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:41,969
"And all of the people
with nothing to do"

569
00:39:42,086 --> 00:39:46,935
"Nothing to lose
and it's you and me"

570
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:52,219
"And all of the people
and I don't know why"

571
00:39:52,278 --> 00:39:56,275
"I can't keep my eyes off of you"

572
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:04,867
"What are the things that i want to say"

573
00:40:04,914 --> 00:40:09,400
"just aren't coming out right"

574
00:40:10,273 --> 00:40:13,525
"im tripping on words, you got my... "

575
00:40:13,572 --> 00:40:14,465
Hey.

576
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:19,876
You know, a year from now,

577
00:40:20,075 --> 00:40:22,036
this is all gonna feel like a lifetime ago.

578
00:40:22,095 --> 00:40:23,809
That's funny, because it feels like just yesterday

579
00:40:23,844 --> 00:40:26,709
when he deserted that nervous freshman
on the dance floor.

580
00:40:26,932 --> 00:40:28,961
You're headed for metropolis.

581
00:40:29,031 --> 00:40:32,331
You are destined to be a big-shot reporter
at the "daily planet. "

582
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:36,293
Do you really picture Clark Ken being able to keep up with you?

583
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:46,181
You know, Lois, I think Clark might have
a lot more to offer than you realize.

584
00:40:46,357 --> 00:40:47,743
I wouldn't bet on it.

585
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:51,550
"There's something about you now"

586
00:40:51,961 --> 00:40:55,460
"I can't quite figure out"

587
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:00,503
"Everything she does
is beautiful"

588
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:02,182
May I have this dance?

589
00:41:05,058 --> 00:41:06,820
I thought you'd never ask.

590
00:41:08,793 --> 00:41:12,024
"'Cause it's you and me"

591
00:41:12,081 --> 00:41:17,210
"And all of the people
with nothing to do"

592
00:41:17,257 --> 00:41:21,976
"Nothing to lose
and it's you and me"

593
00:41:22,235 --> 00:41:27,342
"And all of the people
and I don't know why"

594
00:41:27,389 --> 00:41:32,415
"I can't keep my eyes off of you
and me"

595
00:41:32,485 --> 00:41:37,704
"And all of the people
with nothing to do"

596
00:41:37,751 --> 00:41:42,765
"And nothing to prove
and it's you and me"

597
00:41:42,812 --> 00:41:48,011
"And all of the people
and I don't know why"

598
00:41:48,058 --> 00:41:51,709
"I can't keep my eyes off of you"

599
00:41:54,114 --> 00:41:58,435
"There's something about you now"

600
00:41:58,858 --> 00:42:02,519
"I can't quite figure out"

601
00:42:03,494 --> 00:42:08,413
"Everything she does
is beautiful"

602
00:42:08,449 --> 00:42:13,287
"Everything she does
is right"

603
00:42:15,671 --> 00:42:18,723
"'Cause it's you and me"

604
00:42:18,864 --> 00:42:24,078
"And all of the people
with nothing to do"

605
00:42:24,137 --> 00:42:28,915
"Nothing to lose
and it's you and me"

606
00:42:29,312 --> 00:42:34,232
"And all of the people
and I don't know why"

607
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:39,324
"I can't keep my eyes off of you
and me"

608
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:44,643
"And all of the people
with nothing to do"

609
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:49,574
"And nothing to prove
and it's you and me"

610
00:42:49,914 --> 00:42:54,893
"And all of the people
and I don't know why"

611
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:58,728
"I can't keep my eyes off of you"

612
00:42:59,713 --> 00:43:03,713
