00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:08,321
KARAOKE TUESDAYS

2
00:00:09,772 --> 00:00:12,415
You know it's true love when you fight off
caffeine-pumped preppies...

3
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:14,241
to get a girl her favorite treat.

4
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:17,269
Scored you the last melted mocha muffin.

5
00:00:18,077 --> 00:00:21,779
And I know my inner chocoholic
will never speak to me again but...

6
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:24,352
I think I'll pass.

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,004
Uh-oh, something is definitely up,
and it's worse than I thought.

8
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,161
Since the sugar fix didn't do the trick,

9
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:35,355
maybe ese will turn
your frown upside down.

10
00:00:35,528 --> 00:00:36,673
Jimmy!

11
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:41,576
Oh, my god, you must've broken a whole
pen of piggy banks to afford these.

12
00:00:41,586 --> 00:00:45,374
And you are worth every dime,
nickel, and penny.

13
00:00:46,802 --> 00:00:50,640
A night on the town, just the two of us,
might be exactly what the doctor ordered.

14
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,372
Uh, you're doing
that distant thing.

15
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:06,905
I'm sorry. I think an old friend
just buzzed into town.

16
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:08,473
Wait here.

17
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:15,869
Yeah, I think one of
your patients is missing.

18
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:18,683
Sasha woodman, early 20s...

19
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:20,538
Sorry, who?

20
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:22,500
Has a thing for bees?

21
00:01:22,626 --> 00:01:24,897
- We'll check our record, miss.
- Okay.

22
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,433
- I didn't escape.
- Back off!

23
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:33,876
You or any of your swarm try and sting me,
and I will go black flag on you.

24
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:36,629
- Do I know you?
- Chloe Sullivan.

25
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:41,219
Freshman year, you tried to go queen
bee and kill two of my best friends.

26
00:01:41,613 --> 00:01:43,450
How did you get past the orderlies?

27
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:45,072
You don't understand.

28
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,296
I don't belong in Belle Reve.
I'm not a meteor freak anymore.

29
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:50,195
I've been cured.

30
00:01:54,726 --> 00:01:57,929
A few weeks ago, I had an operation.

31
00:01:59,176 --> 00:02:00,937
Operation?

32
00:02:01,056 --> 00:02:03,085
Who was the doctor?

33
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:05,631
Curtis Knox.

34
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:08,430
He changed my life.

35
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:12,452
My family told me about
the terrible things I did in the past,

36
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:14,775
but I'm different now.

37
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:17,255
What do you mean
your family told you?

38
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:21,307
When they took away my powers,
some of my memory went along with it.

39
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:25,342
The last... six years are blank.

40
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:29,691
If I did anything to you
or your friends,

41
00:02:30,637 --> 00:02:32,262
I'm really sorry.

42
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,478
POUNTY VALLEY LIVESTOCK FEED

43
00:03:09,337 --> 00:03:12,365
Dr. Knox!
You scared me.

44
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,555
What are you doing here?

45
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,649
You have something I need.

46
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:20,157
I do?

47
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,534
Boby Flay, Rachael Ray,
look out - here comes Lana Lang.

48
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,400
Can I help?
What you making?

49
00:04:46,493 --> 00:04:49,854
Clark's favorite, blueberry pancakes.
I want to surprise him before he wakes up.

50
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:53,124
This is what I don't get.

51
00:04:53,485 --> 00:04:55,847
You guys are so ga-ga
over each other,

52
00:04:56,358 --> 00:04:58,544
and you've known each other
forever, right?

53
00:04:59,103 --> 00:05:00,737
What took you so long?

54
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:05,027
Well, as long as cla kept
his secret, it was impossible.

55
00:05:08,047 --> 00:05:12,628
So is it like a... a human thing to be
so secretive and cautious, or what?

56
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,981
No, I think it's just a Clark thing.

57
00:05:15,664 --> 00:05:18,741
But he's only that way because
he cares so much about protecting people.

58
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:25,499
Oh, you didn't have do
all this. It looks great.

59
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:28,387
Yeah, but we're out of maple syrup.

60
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,326
Did you just go to the store?

61
00:05:36,924 --> 00:05:38,844
Vermont's finest.

62
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:41,821
What happened to not showing off
your powers, hmm?

63
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,591
Stay away from Kal-El.

64
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:52,397
You might have been able to bully me
on Krypton, but not on this planet.

65
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:56,888
You two know each other?

66
00:06:00,131 --> 00:06:02,958
He's the one that broke into our house
in the middle of the night and forced...

67
00:06:03,093 --> 00:06:04,231
my family from our home.

68
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:06,809
Considering what your father
did, you were lucky.

69
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:09,997
What's he doing here?

70
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,974
He saved my life.
He's a friend.

71
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:16,756
Then picking friends
isn't one of your skills.

72
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:21,001
Watch your back, Kal-El.

73
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:29,324
Let me guess, you're from Krypton, as well?

74
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,384
Mars, actually.

75
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:43,251
Well, I'll let you two catch up.

76
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:47,226
And I'm gonna go and meet
aunt Nell in Metropolis.

77
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:50,680
It was nice to meet you.

78
00:07:06,945 --> 00:07:09,434
Your cousin's arrival cannot be
taken lightly, Kal-El.

79
00:07:11,187 --> 00:07:13,459
I went to see my father.
He gave me the same warning.

80
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:16,524
But I don't get it. She's my cousin.
The only Kryptonian family I have...

81
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:18,893
besides a disembodied voice from the arctic.

82
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,499
And she could use your longing
for family against you.

83
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:23,734
She's dangerous.

84
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:26,745
Her father tried to assassinate Jor-El.

85
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:29,383
They were brothers.

86
00:07:29,418 --> 00:07:33,177
Their hatred for one another
was stronger than any familial bond.

87
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:37,541
Does Kara have her crystal?

88
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,838
Not anymore. It was in her ship
when it exploded, but now it's missing.

89
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:45,229
I've been trying to help her
find it, but we've had no luck.

90
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,013
If she gets to that crystal,

91
00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:49,854
everything you hold dear
in this world could be lost.

92
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:52,959
You must find the crystal before Kara.

93
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:57,045
Trust is a luxury you cannot afford.

94
00:08:11,777 --> 00:08:14,122
My apologies for keeping you waiting.

95
00:08:15,808 --> 00:08:20,171
Mussolini once killed a conductor
for not keeping a train on schedule.

96
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:24,391
Fortunately, I'm infinitely
more patient than il Duce.

97
00:08:24,778 --> 00:08:27,502
Mussolini went down in defeat, doctor.

98
00:08:27,783 --> 00:08:30,217
I won't accept that
in what we're undertaking.

99
00:08:30,828 --> 00:08:33,405
Well, hiring me is certainly
a winning strategy.

100
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:38,788
Legions of your own scientists said that
curing the meteor-infected was impossible.

101
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,135
Well, as impressive as your results are,

102
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,085
some of your practices deeply concern me.

103
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:49,604
I sever the cerebral wiring of the freaks
in your gallery, and you pay me my fee.

104
00:08:49,702 --> 00:08:51,366
End of story.

105
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:54,790
You've authorized batteries
of tests I never approved.

106
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,838
Tell me, are the levels of meteor rock
toxicity in the patients' vital organs...

107
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:01,205
really relevant to the task at hand?

108
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:06,609
Mankind's greatest advances would never
have seen the light of day had the...

109
00:09:06,744 --> 00:09:11,093
genius minds behind them been
scrutinized under a microscope.

110
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:14,715
Leave the scnce to me.

111
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:18,267
Doctor, three of my patients
are missing.

112
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:23,904
You wouldn't happen to have any idea why
someone with a brand-new lease on life...

113
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,845
would suddenly disappear?

114
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,464
Perhaps it's because you
insisted on eradicating any...

115
00:09:28,565 --> 00:09:31,848
recollection of their
stay at hotel 33.1.

116
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:37,054
No. I insisted they be able to start new
lives unttered by disturbing memories.

117
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:39,423
Especially those that
could incriminate you.

118
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:47,363
If there's nothing else,
I have a schedule to keep.

119
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:22,934
I have good news, my love.

120
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:28,755
I found another piece of the puzzle.

121
00:10:57,462 --> 00:10:59,412
Please let me go.

122
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:01,506
Shh! Shh, shh!

123
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:03,909
Relax, Sasha.

124
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:06,160
Just relax.

125
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:09,852
You're here...

126
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:13,770
to serve a greater purpose.

127
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:32,566
Is my girl ready to rock?

128
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:35,659
I was thinking that we either hit Chang's
on the way to the show tonight,

129
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:37,583
or we can chow down chili dogs
at the arena.

130
00:11:37,682 --> 00:11:41,521
Jimmy, I know you spent a small
fortune these tickets tonight, but...

131
00:11:41,603 --> 00:11:45,062
Ow. Why is the word "but"
never followed by something good?

132
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,074
Would I be the worst girlfriend in
the world if I asked for a rain check...

133
00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:51,224
on our night out on the town tonight?

134
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:54,530
I know.
I- I'll make it up to you.

135
00:11:54,678 --> 00:11:57,744
It's just I'm chasing down a hot lead
on the meteor challenged.

136
00:11:57,806 --> 00:11:59,538
This can't wait till tomorrow?

137
00:12:00,015 --> 00:12:02,390
Look, please don't take this personally.

138
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:06,314
I thought I could deal with this, but it's
just everything's about meteor freaks lately.

139
00:12:06,349 --> 00:12:09,353
I thought we agreed we weren't
gonna use that word anymore.

140
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:13,035
Well, that's what they are, and if those
freaks were locked up in Belle Reve, then...

141
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,119
maybe I'd get to see you once in a while.

142
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:27,415
Chloe, can Dr. Curtis Knox take
a backseat? I need your help.

143
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:29,638
You're gonna have to hang a bell
around your neck or something,

144
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:31,372
so I can at least hear when you're coming.

145
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:34,076
I need you to help me find
Kara's missing cryst. All right?

146
00:12:34,111 --> 00:12:36,084
I need you to check the
databases, satellite imagery...

147
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:40,176
Clark, you're gonna have to fly solo on this
one 'cause my dance cart's completely full.

148
00:12:40,363 --> 00:12:42,984
- Chloe, this is important.
- I'm sure that it is.

149
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,367
Look, I know that from mount Olympus,
the view must seem like us mere mortals...

150
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,937
have nothing better to do than
help you look for your crystal, but...

151
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:52,296
believe it or not, I have
important this to do, too.

152
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,282
Chloe?

153
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,337
So, tell me how I can help you,

154
00:13:10,438 --> 00:13:13,972
Miss... Sullivan.

155
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,620
I'm a meteor freak...

156
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:21,647
and... I want to be cured.

157
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:43,098
Lana?

158
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,325
Hey.

159
00:13:46,486 --> 00:13:48,744
Sorry about the clash
of the titans this morning.

160
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:50,828
Oh, I'll get used to it.

161
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:54,629
You're home early. I thought Chloe was
helping you to track down Kara's crystal.

162
00:13:55,914 --> 00:13:58,183
Lana, has she opened up
to you about anything?

163
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,456
Maybe something
that's been bothering her?

164
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:04,892
No, she's been working 24-7 to
impress that wonderboy editor.

165
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:07,358
She was researching a story...

166
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:10,180
- ... about a Dr. Knox.
- Curtis Knox?

167
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:11,857
You've heard of him?

168
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:14,262
Yeah, he's a...
he's a neurosurgeon.

169
00:14:14,544 --> 00:14:17,716
I heard a rumor that he's working
with meteor-infected people.

170
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,582
Ho do you know all this?

171
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:26,253
Well, I've been doing my own
research on the meteor-infected.

172
00:14:27,442 --> 00:14:29,882
More people than just me
have been hurt by Lex,

173
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:31,706
and they need help.

174
00:14:31,846 --> 00:14:33,799
And I want to do whatever I can.

175
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,591
I didn't know you had a secret
plan to save the world.

176
00:14:39,557 --> 00:14:43,647
So far, I've only made a few contacts.
Knox's name just came up.

177
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:49,101
As amazing as it sounds, he is using
brain surgery to remove their powers.

178
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:53,700
That actually explains a lot.

179
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,430
A headline like this
could change Chloe's life.

180
00:14:58,937 --> 00:15:00,184
Yeah.

181
00:15:07,021 --> 00:15:10,825
Trust me, if these seats were any closer,
you'd be arrested for stalking the band.

182
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,540
I'm scoring big points
with the boyfriend, Olsen.

183
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:15,339
Ring that bell.

184
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,554
There it is.

185
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,216
James!

186
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:21,534
Hey.

187
00:15:21,627 --> 00:15:23,715
I'm so glad I found you.

188
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:25,536
Really?

189
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:29,104
Yeah, um, I've been looking all over
for Lois. Have you seen her?

190
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:32,333
Uh, you'll need a telescope.

191
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:36,895
New editor sent her to the City of Angel to
get a quote from the D. U. I. of the week.

192
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:39,672
Bummer.

193
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:42,513
You know, I heard
that she snuck into a grain silo...

194
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:44,867
and to some videos of a spaceship.

195
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,952
I was kind of hoping
I could sneak a peek.

196
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:49,074
I'm a bit of an E. T. Junkie.

197
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:51,749
No kidding? Me too.

198
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:54,616
I used to sit in the backyard and
try and pick up martian signals...

199
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:55,944
on my dad's ham radio.

200
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:59,353
Um, Martians use infrared, silly.

201
00:16:01,506 --> 00:16:06,352
Well, um unfortunately, Lois'
video is nothing to phone home out.

202
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:09,354
Tech guy couldn't get anything
off it but static.

203
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,851
Well, um, you know your way
around cameras, right?

204
00:16:14,926 --> 00:16:17,323
And I bet you're a lot smarter
than he is.

205
00:16:18,206 --> 00:16:20,276
Is there anything
that you could do?

206
00:16:23,574 --> 00:16:25,192
What the heck?

207
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,883
It's not like I'm doing
anything else tonight.

208
00:16:28,216 --> 00:16:30,904
I'll crunch a few pixels,
see what I come up with.

209
00:16:31,237 --> 00:16:34,994
Okay.
You are my hero.

210
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:38,489
Call my cell when you're done,
and I'll be he in a blink.

211
00:16:40,891 --> 00:16:42,371
Thanks.

212
00:16:58,422 --> 00:17:00,759
How's your article going about Dr. Knox?

213
00:17:03,553 --> 00:17:05,476
Uh, he's doing some
interesting research, but...

214
00:17:05,511 --> 00:17:07,532
I don't believe there'a story there.

215
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:10,732
Neither do I.

216
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,338
Chloe, you're a good liar.

217
00:17:14,373 --> 00:17:17,101
You've had lots of experience
keeping my secret,

218
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,837
but I don't believe you're
researching Knox for an article.

219
00:17:20,716 --> 00:17:22,822
I think it's about
the procedure.

220
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,226
Then you realize
that he's my only hope.

221
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:33,415
Dr. Knox said he could fit me in
at the end of this week.

222
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,071
Chloe, you don't kw anything
about this doctor.

223
00:17:36,731 --> 00:17:39,836
I know that he can give me
a chance at a normal life.

224
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:43,069
Look, I understand wanting
to have a normal life... I do.

225
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:45,994
But brain surgy is not
the way to do it.

226
00:17:46,017 --> 00:17:47,882
You don't understand, Clark.

227
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:50,285
Going psycho or turning
into a serial killer...

228
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,401
aren't the only two
things I have tworry about.

229
00:17:52,624 --> 00:17:56,053
When I healed Lois in that dam,
it almost killed me.

230
00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:59,651
Who's to say the next time I try
and save someone isn't my last?

231
00:18:01,044 --> 00:18:02,835
What are the side fects
of the procedure?

232
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:07,735
- Potentially memory loss.
- Chloe.

233
00:18:07,764 --> 00:18:11,031
If I have to give up a bit of my past
to gain a future, then so bet.

234
00:18:11,086 --> 00:18:14,362
You're gonna forget everything. You're gonna
forget your friends, your experiences...

235
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:18,338
You're gonna forget me.

236
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:21,069
You're gonna forget me.

237
00:18:28,794 --> 00:18:31,035
People will be there when I come
back to fill in the blanks.

238
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:34,239
In time, I'll be fine.

239
00:18:38,604 --> 00:18:41,666
Clark, if you want
to save me, let me go.

240
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:22,729
I applaud your ingenty, doctor.

241
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:26,773
After mulching the body
into the fertilizer supply,

242
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:30,592
by week's end her DNA will be spread
over every cornfield in Kansas.

243
00:19:31,135 --> 00:19:32,465
Oh, Lex.

244
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,199
If only you were a typical rich kid -
Chasing women across the globe...

245
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:40,365
instead of dabbling with science
that you don't understand.

246
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:43,323
Your killing spree
stops right now.

247
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:45,384
I'm not gonna let you hurt
one more person.

248
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:48,369
Countless patients are living new lives...

249
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,450
with no idea what you did
to them, thanks to me.

250
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:54,626
How about the ones
you murdered?

251
00:19:55,232 --> 00:19:57,105
They're the chosen few,

252
00:19:57,373 --> 00:20:01,128
the reason I created a cure
and came knocking at your door.

253
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:05,308
Because I knew that somewhere
in your museum of oddities...

254
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:08,424
I would find the ones
I was looking for.

255
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:11,119
Your practice is closed, doctor.

256
00:20:11,248 --> 00:20:14,846
You come one step closer,
and I swear to god, I will shoot you.

257
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:19,796
I'm quaking in my boots.

258
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,622
Son of a bitch!

259
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,938
I have been speared by mayan warriors...

260
00:20:52,522 --> 00:20:54,889
survived mongols' arrows,

261
00:20:55,261 --> 00:20:59,089
and the cold steel
of crusaders' blades.

262
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:05,932
What makes you think that the sting
of a 9 millimeter could slow me down?

263
00:21:37,723 --> 00:21:39,858
So, you're no Mr. Miyagi.

264
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:43,243
But that's okay, because...

265
00:21:43,995 --> 00:21:45,779
I know a little trick.

266
00:21:47,883 --> 00:21:51,325
Now, you move the top stick,
and keep the lower one straight,

267
00:21:51,438 --> 00:21:54,749
and you never, never let
the noodles intimidate you.

268
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:58,960
Okay. Let'do this.

269
00:22:06,953 --> 00:22:09,129
I new it. You're a natural.

270
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,087
You're a really patient teacher.

271
00:22:13,022 --> 00:22:14,654
Thanks.

272
00:22:17,952 --> 00:22:20,035
Rendering complete.

273
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:24,292
- Video codec rendering completed.
- That's not the ship.

274
00:22:24,617 --> 00:22:26,580
But we got something.

275
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:30,674
Flintlock is a technology supplier for
the security branch of the government.

276
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,825
The government?

277
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:37,113
Looks like we got another area 51
right in the heart of Kansas.

278
00:22:37,427 --> 00:22:41,189
- Oh, Chloe's gonna do backflips.
- No, you can'tell Chloe.

279
00:22:41,837 --> 00:22:43,467
Why not?

280
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,742
Well, she'd tell Clark, and
he can't stand my obsession with UFOs.

281
00:22:48,956 --> 00:22:53,229
But it's exactly what Chloe needs to enter
new editor's honor roll. I got tell her.

282
00:22:54,314 --> 00:22:56,179
James...

283
00:22:56,386 --> 00:22:58,298
I know I can trust you.

284
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:01,576
This has to be our secret.

285
00:23:01,729 --> 00:23:03,895
Okay? It's between you and me.

286
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,200
Chloe.

287
00:23:11,443 --> 00:23:12,989
Do you want some chinese?

288
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:15,447
It's good but they really
make you work for it.

289
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:19,684
What are you doing here?
I thought you said you were busy.

290
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:22,505
And, uh, we were just...

291
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:26,746
Look, I can explain.

292
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,269
There's no need.

293
00:23:29,404 --> 00:23:30,726
I have to go.

294
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:32,271
Chloe.

295
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,679
I swear it's not what it looks like.

296
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:37,275
Bye, Jimmy.

297
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:51,064
SMALLVILLE MEDICAL CENTER

298
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:08,290
You're the last person
I thought would save me.

299
00:24:09,612 --> 00:24:13,792
I was following that butcher you used
to erase the memories of your 33.1 victims.

300
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:16,941
Lana told you about Dr. Knox, didn she?

301
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,733
- Don't bring Lana into this.
- No point in lying for her, Clark.

302
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:24,711
I know Lana's somehow been
uncovering company secrets.

303
00:24:25,151 --> 00:24:28,325
Probably using the $10 million
she stole from me to do it.

304
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,687
At the moment,
I'd say it's money well spent.

305
00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:34,365
If she hadn't tipped you off,
I'd be in the morgue.

306
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:36,771
You're just as guilty as that doctor.

307
00:24:37,824 --> 00:24:40,517
Makes me sick to think that
I had to take a life for yours.

308
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,621
Knox isn't dead, Clark.

309
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:51,693
He came after me.

310
00:24:52,297 --> 00:24:55,379
I put six bullets in his chest.

311
00:24:56,253 --> 00:24:58,223
They didn't leave a scratch.

312
00:25:00,544 --> 00:25:02,333
You're saying Knox is still alive.

313
00:25:02,352 --> 00:25:06,534
Not only is he alive,
he's murdering his patients one by one.

314
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,059
Miss Sullivan. Right on time.

315
00:25:16,735 --> 00:25:18,525
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

316
00:25:18,661 --> 00:25:21,804
I'm just glad my test results
proved I could have the procedure.

317
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:25,941
You're one of a kind. The level of
meteor rock concentration in you heart...

318
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:28,160
It's extraordinary.

319
00:25:29,973 --> 00:25:31,667
In my heart?

320
00:25:31,745 --> 00:25:35,130
Just relax. After tonight,
you'll have thing to worry about.

321
00:25:40,878 --> 00:25:43,013
Where are all your staff?

322
00:25:44,048 --> 00:25:46,112
They'll be here shortly.

323
00:25:52,057 --> 00:25:53,926
What is that?

324
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:22,220
Jimmy. Where's Chloe?
I've been looking everywhere.

325
00:26:22,586 --> 00:26:25,647
We had a major misunderstanding C. K.

326
00:26:26,493 --> 00:26:29,144
- I need your help.
- There's no time. Where is she?

327
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:33,576
Well, she's jumping to conclusions. She
stormed out of here before I could explain.

328
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:34,662
Did she say where she was going?

329
00:26:34,683 --> 00:26:37,027
No, no, but she dropped off
this rubik's cube of a note tonight,

330
00:26:37,198 --> 00:26:39,202
and I have no idea what it means.

331
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:43,285
"after tonight, I might not remember you, so
don't let me forget why we belong together."

332
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:47,523
I don't get it.
C. K. what's happening tonight?

333
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,600
What are you doing?

334
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:03,929
Taking your heart
and giving it to Sophia.

335
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:09,822
Thanks to you, Chloe Sullivan,

336
00:27:11,726 --> 00:27:13,983
my love will last forever.

337
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:28,281
Where did Knox take Chloe?

338
00:27:28,488 --> 00:27:31,200
Look, Clark, I want to stop Knox
as much as you do.

339
00:27:31,452 --> 00:27:34,152
I've check every address we had
on file. They're all dead ends.

340
00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:35,717
He didn't disappear into thin air, Lex.

341
00:27:35,773 --> 00:27:38,670
No, but he's had a lot of
experience covering his tracks.

342
00:27:40,273 --> 00:27:42,262
Send me the pictures on Knox.

343
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:45,784
I used face-recognition software
to run an image search.

344
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:48,767
There we go.

345
00:27:50,732 --> 00:27:54,058
Knox wasn't live during World War II, Lex.
He's too young.

346
00:27:54,082 --> 00:27:56,280
He's much older than he looks.

347
00:27:56,723 --> 00:27:59,006
This is Knox in 1888.

348
00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:02,559
And here he is in 1675.

349
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:07,163
Clark, he's had 1,000 names,
and he's lived for centuries.

350
00:28:07,974 --> 00:28:12,315
That's why you can't kill him.
Curtis Knox is immortal.

351
00:28:14,176 --> 00:28:15,941
Well, he couldn't have gotten far.

352
00:28:16,192 --> 00:28:19,864
He must've dropped this in the struggle with
Chloe. It stopped less than an hour ago.

353
00:28:22,071 --> 00:28:24,078
"Este perpetua. "

354
00:28:24,655 --> 00:28:28,183
"may you live forever. " It's
a roman greeting. I've seen this before.

355
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:29,963
ESTE PERPETUA
VICTORIAN ARMS

356
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,095
The Victorian arms?

357
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,125
Knox was the robber baron who owned it.
He lived there in the '20s.

358
00:28:37,712 --> 00:28:39,600
Maybe he never moved.

359
00:28:42,402 --> 00:28:45,371
If your wife is sick, I can
cure her with my abilities.

360
00:28:45,752 --> 00:28:47,414
Sophie is perfectly healthy.

361
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,242
I've induced her coma simply to
reduce her stress before the procedure.

362
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,480
You put her in a coma because
you knew that she would freak...

363
00:28:55,604 --> 00:28:59,308
if she knew that you were playing fatal
games of operation with innocent people.

364
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:01,408
That doesn't sound like
eternal love to me.

365
00:29:02,946 --> 00:29:06,026
You've been around, what,
two decades?

366
00:29:07,892 --> 00:29:09,793
What do you know about true love?

367
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:13,573
I know there's someone
that I want to live to see again.

368
00:29:13,813 --> 00:29:15,882
A schoolgirl crush.

369
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:18,179
Very quaint.

370
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:21,304
Unfortunately, you won't be able
to say goodbye.

371
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:27,044
Now, let us begin.

372
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:32,175
I came here for help, not to be cut
open by some jack the ripper wannabe!

373
00:29:33,427 --> 00:29:35,746
I was Jack the Ripper.

374
00:29:39,953 --> 00:29:41,562
Ah!

375
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:46,631
Chloe?

376
00:29:53,286 --> 00:29:54,606
Clark!

377
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:59,652
Your powers might be far beyond those
of mortal men, but you've met your match.

378
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:03,403
I won't let you kill anyone else.

379
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:06,092
I'd kill 1,000 more
to never have to be alone.

380
00:30:11,297 --> 00:30:13,991
You don't know the pain
of living centuries...

381
00:30:14,026 --> 00:30:17,398
watching the women you love
grow old and turn to dust!

382
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,721
You and I are more alike than you think.

383
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,412
I won't go through it again!

384
00:30:40,473 --> 00:30:43,220
My god. What have I done?

385
00:30:43,918 --> 00:30:45,829
No, no. No.

386
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:48,053
No!

387
00:30:48,712 --> 00:30:50,647
What have I done?

388
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:11,763
No.

389
00:31:13,422 --> 00:31:15,451
Please don't leave me.

390
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:19,543
Please.

391
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,279
What'd you do with Knox?

392
00:32:11,726 --> 00:32:14,471
Your father and I had a
"don't ask, don't tell" policy...

393
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,586
when it came to crime and punishment.

394
00:32:17,075 --> 00:32:19,974
I suggest we abide by the same rules.

395
00:32:23,681 --> 00:32:25,357
You didn't kill him, did you?

396
00:32:25,392 --> 00:32:27,248
Knox is immortal, Kal-El.

397
00:32:27,295 --> 00:32:28,869
You can't kill him.

398
00:32:30,225 --> 00:32:33,147
I know what it's like to have
feelings for the people here,

399
00:32:33,825 --> 00:32:36,164
but the truth is, you'll outlive them all.

400
00:32:37,212 --> 00:32:41,157
And when they're gone, you still
have a greater calling to fulfill.

401
00:32:42,143 --> 00:32:43,968
Have you found the crystal?

402
00:32:44,153 --> 00:32:46,260
I got a little sidetracked.

403
00:32:47,349 --> 00:32:49,456
What is Red Eyes doing still doing here?

404
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:52,604
I heard what he said about my father.

405
00:32:53,748 --> 00:32:56,759
He's the one who can't be trusted.

406
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,742
Ask him to tell you about
what he did to my family.

407
00:33:02,142 --> 00:33:04,237
Your father was a traitor.

408
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:07,550
He's lying.

409
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:13,503
Who are you gonna believe, Clark...

410
00:33:14,332 --> 00:33:16,251
Your family...

411
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:20,689
or this martian manhunter?

412
00:33:24,483 --> 00:33:27,340
Guess this family reunion is over.

413
00:33:52,978 --> 00:33:54,438
Hey.

414
00:33:54,473 --> 00:33:58,552
I heard the police shut B. C. E. Clinic
down and that Curtis Knox went AWOL.

415
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,336
Did you have anything to do with that?

416
00:34:01,932 --> 00:34:04,206
Turns out he was killing his patients.

417
00:34:06,189 --> 00:34:08,462
Chloe's story got her in
a little over her head.

418
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:11,060
Oh, my god, is she okay?

419
00:34:11,813 --> 00:34:14,208
You know Chloe, there's not a
whole lot that can keep her down.

420
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,781
She's lucky to have someone
like you in her life, Clark.

421
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,816
We all are.

422
00:34:28,604 --> 00:34:29,887
What's wrong?

423
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,614
Lex helped me find Knox.

424
00:34:36,732 --> 00:34:39,066
Well, he probably has
an ulterior motive.

425
00:34:39,147 --> 00:34:42,634
Lex doesn't generally do things
out of the kindness of his haert.

426
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:48,441
He told me you stole $10 million
from him.

427
00:34:56,165 --> 00:34:58,466
You can see
what he's doing, right?

428
00:34:58,553 --> 00:35:01,269
He's trying to destroy
what we have all over again.

429
00:35:04,121 --> 00:35:06,844
Clark, that money was a part
of the divorce settlement.

430
00:35:07,745 --> 00:35:10,029
I plan on using it to help
the meteor-infected people...

431
00:35:10,122 --> 00:35:12,556
who have been victimized by LuthorCorp.

432
00:35:16,423 --> 00:35:19,096
Don't let Lex's lies come between us.

433
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:26,886
I'd never hide anything from you.

434
00:36:46,886 --> 00:36:48,290
Hey.

435
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:52,665
There you are.

436
00:36:56,084 --> 00:36:57,591
Remember me?

437
00:36:58,308 --> 00:36:59,797
Jimmy.

438
00:37:00,197 --> 00:37:02,157
That's a good sign.

439
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:07,637
Though your letter was a little "Da Vinci
Code," and I'm no cryptologist, but...

440
00:37:08,609 --> 00:37:11,229
I brought this...

441
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,016
to remind you why we belong together.

442
00:37:28,342 --> 00:37:29,998
Oh.

443
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:33,820
It's the cocktail napkin from that july
fourth party where you gave me your number.

444
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:38,351
Oh, the Grandville carnival.
This was the best first date ever.

445
00:37:40,211 --> 00:37:41,925
And my favorite...

446
00:37:42,686 --> 00:37:45,037
a piece of stain glass
from the bullpen that broke

447
00:37:45,251 --> 00:37:47,513
during that weird earthquake last fall.

448
00:37:48,996 --> 00:37:51,859
Okay, now I'm the one
that needs the decoder ring.

449
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:57,595
We lost touch for the longest time,

450
00:37:58,379 --> 00:38:01,937
and the day that we bumped into
each other again, the world...

451
00:38:04,269 --> 00:38:06,333
well, it literally shook.

452
00:38:10,011 --> 00:38:12,631
And if that's not a sign,
I don't know what is.

453
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:16,962
Jimmy, I'm so sorry
about all the craziness...

454
00:38:17,063 --> 00:38:19,242
I've put you through
the last couple of weeks.

455
00:38:20,353 --> 00:38:22,771
Well, let's just agree that
the future'll be more normal.

456
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,928
Deal?

457
00:38:28,562 --> 00:38:32,371
You know, I don't think
I can make you that promise.

458
00:38:35,192 --> 00:38:39,135
I don't think things will ever
be normal between the two of us.

459
00:38:48,346 --> 00:38:50,010
Okay.

460
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,076
Wait a sec...

461
00:39:01,191 --> 00:39:03,274
is this because of Kara?

462
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:09,166
Because after all the times
that you left me on hold to go...

463
00:39:09,201 --> 00:39:11,846
run off and help Clark,
I'd hate to think that...

464
00:39:11,946 --> 00:39:14,111
you're gonna give me a hard time
for helping Kara once.

465
00:39:14,134 --> 00:39:17,491
No, this isn't about Kara.
This is about me. This is entirely me.

466
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,754
What's going on, Chloe?

467
00:39:35,105 --> 00:39:37,400
if you can't say it...

468
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,638
try some sign language or subtitles.

469
00:39:44,287 --> 00:39:46,913
I can't. I'm sorry.

470
00:39:48,855 --> 00:39:50,744
So am I.

471
00:39:52,177 --> 00:39:54,304
'Cause I've tried really,

472
00:39:54,605 --> 00:39:57,497
really hard to be
the understanding boyfriend,

473
00:39:58,323 --> 00:40:02,275
but there's only so much a guy can take
before there's nothing else to do but jump.

474
00:40:05,257 --> 00:40:07,154
I don't know what to say.

475
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:11,729
Maybe that earthquake
wasn't a sign.

476
00:40:16,072 --> 00:40:18,691
Maybe it was a giant fluke
just like this relationship.

477
00:40:24,229 --> 00:40:26,435
Maybe you're right.

478
00:40:35,824 --> 00:40:37,881
You know what?

479
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:45,049
I can't do this anymore, Chloe.

480
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,941
I can't.
