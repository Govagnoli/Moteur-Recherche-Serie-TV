1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,666
- Clark, you're gonna be late.
- Okay, Mom, I'm going as fast as I can.

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:12,539
How can you be fast as lightning and
as slow as molasses all at the same time?

3
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:14,771
Sometimes, Mom, I'm even
a mystery to myself.

4
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,473
Wait a minute, didn't I fix
your alarm clock recently?

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,278
I crushed it this morning
hitting the snooze alarm.

6
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:24,856
- Guess I'm not much of a morning person.
- Must have gotten that from your mother.

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,856
She could be late to her own wedding.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,361
- In fact, she was late to her own wedding.
- Not all of us were trained by roosters.

9
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,261
I was up late studying
for an exam, Greek tragedy.

10
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,267
Speaking of Greek tragedy,
I've gotta get your mother to work.

11
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,928
- Want a ride?
- No, I'd just slow you guys down.

12
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,040
Thank you, baby.

13
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,626
Hera freaks out because Zeus
has been two-timing her...

14
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,604
...with a mere mortal, no less, so she
sends a bunch of snakes to kill Hercules...

15
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:25,266
...who is the illegitimate babe
in the cradle.

16
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,710
It's just family dysfunction
of Dionysian proportions.

17
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,516
It sounds like these people
ought to be on Ricki Lake.

18
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:34,551
While I don't condone her behavior,
Zeus did break his vows.

19
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,189
Doesn't give her the right
to go Fatal Attraction.

20
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:41,123
Hey, Clark, hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

21
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,099
Hello, Clark.

22
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,606
- Do we know each other?
- No.

23
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,935
Well, yes.

24
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,406
Clark, I'm your mother.

25
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,562
It's obviously a mistake,
she's not your mother.

26
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:02,037
That's what I told her. She said I probably
just need time to get used to the idea.

27
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:05,808
She gave me her phone number,
told me to call if I wanted to talk again.

28
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,914
I don't want you to have
anything to do with this woman.

29
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,515
She's gonna be hard to avoid.

30
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,514
She said she just bought a house...

31
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,676
...in Smallville.

32
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,422
She also said the agency that handled the
adoption was Metropolis United Charities.

33
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,227
That's the same place
Chloe told me about.

34
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,387
I thought the only adoption
they handled was mine.

35
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,230
So did I.

36
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:33,862
- Dad, tell me what happened back then.
- That's not important right now.

37
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,066
Your mother's right. We need to get
this woman to back off.

38
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,870
We don't want her making people curious
about where you came from.

39
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,516
Mrs. Kent...

40
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,750
...I know what you're thinking:

41
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,849
"This woman gave her baby up.

42
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,618
What right does she have
to show up after so many years?"

43
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,784
Well, the thought did occur to me.

44
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:02,093
Look, Mrs. Dunlevy,
I'm sure you mean well.

45
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,362
And I know you've gone through
a lot of trouble finding Clark...

46
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,631
...but he's not your child.

47
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,275
Oh, I've done the research.

48
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:15,972
My Lucas was the only baby turned
over to Metropolis United Charities...

49
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,777
...and Clark was the only child
that they ever placed.

50
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,045
We are Clark's legal parents,
we raised him.

51
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:25,054
Believe me, I'm not trying
to take Clark away from you.

52
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,784
I just want a chance
to get to know him.

53
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,861
Giving up Lucas was the worst thing
I've ever done.

54
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,296
I didn't do it because I wanted to,
I did it because I had to.

55
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:43,139
I sincerely hope that you
find Lucas someday.

56
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:50,712
But I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you
not to bother my family or Clark ever again.

57
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,049
No.

58
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,899
Sure, Clark, you can use my computer.
Knock yourself out.

59
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,400
You've been getting e-mails
from Rachel Dunlevy.

60
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,873
You've been reading my e-mails?

61
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,566
You promised me you'd stop
digging into my adoption.

62
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,873
All I did was post a few notices on adoption
websites to see if I could get some hits.

63
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,416
This Dunlevy woman responded.

64
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,987
So you said, "Why don't you check out
my buddy Clark, he may be your son."

65
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:33,250
You have to believe me,
I didn't tell her anything about you.

66
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:37,157
So it's just a coincidence she shows up
in Smallville claiming to be my mom?

67
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,733
She's here? Clark, what makes you
so sure that she's not the real thing?

68
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,801
I'm not giving you
an exclusive on my life.

69
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,701
- You're not curious she might be your mom?
- Why are you obsessed about my mother?

70
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,638
- Do I ask you questions about yours?
- I guess not.

71
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,268
If you want to find somebody's mother,
find your own.

72
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:59,077
I know where she is, Clark. The difference
is she's not interested in me.

73
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,318
Since you may never speak to me again,
there's something you might want to know.

74
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,663
Metropolis United Charities
was founded by Lionel Luthor.

75
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:24,835
I admit, I'm even more intrigued now
than when I got your note.

76
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,411
But I'm still not sure what
this has to do with me.

77
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,640
Well, I understand that you
and Clark are good friends.

78
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,448
Mr. Kent has forbidden me
to speak to him.

79
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:38,647
I thought you might be willing to talk
to Clark, ask him to give me a chance.

80
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,322
Ms. Dunlevy, Jonathan Kent
doesn't exactly see me...

81
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,055
...as the ideal role model for his son.

82
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,029
I wouldn't want to encourage Clark
to defy his father.

83
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,466
Even if it meant giving him a chance
to know his real mother?

84
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:57,201
I'm sorry, but it's just not appropriate
for me to get involved.

85
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:02,475
I wasn't going to bring this up
unless I had to...

86
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,015
...but I once worked for your mother.
- You knew my mother?

87
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:12,021
And your father.
He and I became very close.

88
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,866
He got me pregnant and made me
give the child up for adoption.

89
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,300
You're claiming that Clark...?

90
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,846
That Clark and I...?

91
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,144
He's your brother, Lex.

92
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:46,221
Chloe. Hey, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

93
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,853
What's wrong?

94
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,588
Clark and I just had
a massive blowout.

95
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,163
About what?

96
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:57,860
Secrets, privacy, my pathological inability
to curb my curiosity.

97
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,835
- How are you?
- Hey, we can talk about it later.

98
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,936
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to dump on you.

99
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,144
- Lf you can't dump on your friends...
- Exactly.

100
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,679
So, what did you want to talk about?

101
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,893
- His name's Henry Small.
- As in the Smallville Smalls?

102
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,291
Our very own first family.

103
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,526
Well, who's the hottie
hanging all over him?

104
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,204
My mom.

105
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,570
- Oh, I'm sorry, Lana.
- It's okay, you didn't know.

106
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:43,741
I think he may be
my biological father.

107
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,274
You okay?

108
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,213
I think so.

109
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,920
I want to find out everything
there is to know about him.

110
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,857
I thought...

111
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,428
...maybe you could help.

112
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,898
- But if you don't feel comfortable, it's...
- Actually, I'm flattered.

113
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,734
It's nice that someone trusts me enough
with their big family secret.

114
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,966
Then you'll do it?

115
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,178
I can tell you where he went to college...

116
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,678
...how many outstanding
parking tickets he has...

117
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:19,477
...I can even pull up his dental records
and tell you if he flosses regularly.

118
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,244
But if you want
to know who he is...

119
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,357
...I would suggest using the high-tech
research device called the doorbell.

120
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,234
- Clark?
- Grab a sack, son.

121
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:46,970
I just found out that Lionel Luthor
founded Metropolis United Charities.

122
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,013
Why was he involved in my adoption?

123
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:55,149
- Would somebody tell me what's going on?
- Jonathan, he needs to know.

124
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,189
All right. It was the day of
the meteor shower when I realized...

125
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,158
...that nothing was gonna be normal
around here again.

126
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,205
What's happening, Jonathan?

127
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,701
Martha?

128
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,171
Teddy!

129
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,918
Jonathan, look out!

130
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,784
Help! Stop, please! I need help!

131
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,618
- Are you all right?
- It's my son.

132
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,129
- What about him? Is he hurt?
- He... I can't...

133
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,529
Mister, calm down here.
Where is your son?

134
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,261
He... He's...

135
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:41,984
Give me a hand.

136
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,485
What happened to him?
His hair is...

137
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,705
Can't we go any faster?

138
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,175
We're doing the best that we can.

139
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,479
What are you carrying back there?
It's slowing us down.

140
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,417
Hey, how's your son?

141
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,526
He's in shock, but he'll survive.

142
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,634
You saved him, acting so quickly.

143
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,201
I'm glad I could help out.

144
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,437
I'm sorry. I don't
even know your name.

145
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,598
Jonathan Kent.

146
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:15,440
Nice to meet you, Mr. Kent.
If there's ever anything I can do for you...

147
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,809
...please, call me.

148
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,452
I mean that, Mr. Kent.

149
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,363
Dad, you were a hero.

150
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,971
I don't know why you thought
you had to keep that a secret from me.

151
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:56,283
Ethan. Is there something
we can do for you?

152
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,789
I'm sure you know there's a woman
in town claiming to be Clark's mother.

153
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,724
Well, she's petitioned Judge Ross
to order a DNA test.

154
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,933
- But that's crazy. She's not my mother.
- Lf that's true, this test will prove it, son.

155
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,593
I can have somebody come out and take
the sample to Metropolis Genetics Lab.

156
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:16,298
They can run the test in the morning,
we can get this thing over with quick.

157
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,706
I'm sure you folks have
nothing to be afraid of.

158
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,959
Not to mention, it's an eyesore.

159
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,830
No. They're dumping there.

160
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,094
Oh, come on.

161
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,897
What do you mean, that's it?

162
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:50,041
I don't care what
Lowell County Water and Power says...

163
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:54,942
...they are illegally dumping, and
I'm not gonna sit here... Hello? Hello?!

164
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,608
- Mr. Small?
- What?

165
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,251
I'm sorry.

166
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,794
I'm not taking on
any more law students right now.

167
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,728
No, no, I'm not a law student.

168
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,632
Wait, I know you.

169
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,296
You do?

170
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:25,932
Yeah, you run the coffee place
in town.

171
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:29,376
Yeah, yeah, the Talon.
I don't think I've seen you there.

172
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,982
And you never will. I boycott it.

173
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,952
Do you have a thing against coffee?

174
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,683
No, I've got a thing against Luthors.

175
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,788
Lex Luthor's just a silent partner.

176
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,459
That's what the Vichy said about Nazis.
Look what happened to France.

177
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,664
I didn't catch your name.

178
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,704
Lana Lang.

179
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,472
You knew my mother.

180
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,348
Where did you get this?

181
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,719
I found it.

182
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,329
Did you love her?

183
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,830
What do you want me to say?

184
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,503
It's ancient history, it doesn't matter.

185
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:30,404
Henry, can you stop saving the world for
one minute and give me a hand, please?

186
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,101
Okay, honey, I'll be right there.

187
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,918
- Look, Lana...
- I think you might be my father.

188
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:48,050
- Honey, are you coming?
- Yeah, I'll be in in one second.

189
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,188
Look, Lana, you've made a mistake.

190
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:56,164
- But l...
- I have a family now.

191
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,635
Please, don't bother me again.

192
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,845
There. Now that didn't
hurt a bit, did it?

193
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,690
I'll let you know.

194
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,593
Dad...

195
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,762
You had to do it, Clark. If we'd refused,
they'd have dragged us into court.

196
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,670
What happens when they look
at his DNA under a microscope?

197
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,105
If I even have DNA.

198
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,907
That's why we have to make sure nobody
gets a chance to analyze that sample.

199
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,142
This is it.

200
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,719
There.

201
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,530
Man, this Mission: Impossible
stuff is great...

202
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,902
...but other than my scintillating
conversational skills...

203
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,981
...I still don't understand
why you brought me along.

204
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,881
I need your spit.

205
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:05,789
You can relax. We switched
the sample, no one saw us.

206
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,831
Clark, I'm sorry to have put
you through all this.

207
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,368
It's not your fault, Dad. I guess
it just comes with the territory.

208
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:16,439
Yeah. I'm gonna go
work on the combine.

209
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:23,275
Everything's okay. Why does
Dad still seem upset?

210
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,616
This has been tough on him.

211
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,979
He always said making
a deal with the devil...

212
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,612
...was gonna come back to haunt us.
- Then why'd he do it?

213
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,186
Come on, Mom.

214
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,253
Why'd you need Lionel Luthor's
help in the first place?

215
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:45,559
You have no idea
the kind of pressure we were under.

216
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,835
We suddenly had this new
little person in our home.

217
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:53,535
We didn't know what to do with you.
We were completely overwhelmed.

218
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,244
Thank goodness
your mother was a pack rat.

219
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,049
Sweetheart, he's not ours to keep.

220
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,750
I just keep feeling there's
a reason he's here.

221
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:13,091
He's exactly what I wished for
in the flower shop this morning.

222
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:18,567
Hey. Since when did Martha Kent
believe in magic wands?

223
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:22,664
Since the moment
I laid eyes on this little boy.

224
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:27,511
Get him upstairs. Hurry, go on.

225
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,112
Just a...

226
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,805
Just a second.

227
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,950
- Evening, Jonathan.
- Ethan.

228
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,750
I saw what was left
of your truck out on Route 17.

229
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,291
I wanted to stop by
and make sure you're all right.

230
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,895
We're just a little banged up,
but we're fine.

231
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:50,933
Look, I'm sure there are folks who need
your attention a lot more than we...

232
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:55,304
- Who's the little fellow?
- He got away from me. He's strong.

233
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,837
- That's...
- Clark.

234
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,371
I thought my family name
would make a good first name.

235
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:07,280
Deputy, I would like you to be the
first one in Smallville to meet our son.

236
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:14,047
Adopted, of course. We just brought him
back from Metropolis this morning.

237
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,757
I didn't know you folks
were planning to adopt.

238
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:21,128
Oh, Ethan, you know us,
we like to keep to ourselves.

239
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:25,065
But it's been in the works
for quite a while.

240
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,034
Well, congratulations.

241
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:33,041
It's nice to see something good
happen in the middle of all this tragedy.

242
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,180
He was right.

243
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:47,587
You were the one good thing
that happened that day.

244
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,454
So you just made it up,
spur of the moment.

245
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,466
I couldn't say we'd found you
in a corn field.

246
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:01,834
Once the words came out, I knew
we'd have to back them up eventually.

247
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:07,342
So we called Lionel Luthor, cashed in
that favor. He arranged everything.

248
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,507
If everything worked out,
why'd you keep it secret?

249
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:15,085
Hey, I hope I'm not interrupting
anything important.

250
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,050
Not at all, Lex.

251
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,888
Ever wish you had a big brother
to help you with your jump shot?

252
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:27,327
I think I've managed to become
a pretty decent player on my own.

253
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,266
Rachel Dunlevy came to see me.

254
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,773
She says you and I have
a few chromosomes in common.

255
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:39,468
My father's chromosomes, to be exact.

256
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,912
You mean...?

257
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,640
Personally, I think I got
all the looks in the family.

258
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,346
I don't know what happened
between her and your father...

259
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,650
...but she's not my mother.
- Trust me, I'm as skeptical as you are.

260
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:58,228
For all I know, this is an elaborate scheme
to win a paternity suit against my father.

261
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,193
Did you ask him about it?

262
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:04,859
I didn't want to make any accusations until
I had more facts. It's not hard to imagine.

263
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:10,133
In the annals of extramarital exploits,
my father probably has his own chapter.

264
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,577
It doesn't bother you? I mean,
I know how close you were to your mother.

265
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,610
To the extent that it caused
my mother pain...

266
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,811
...sure, it bothers me.

267
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,718
Unfortunately, not every marriage...

268
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:29,327
...is quite as Rockwellian
as Jonathan and Martha Kent's.

269
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:36,326
Anyway, I told Ms. Dunlevy
that in the 21 st century...

270
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,902
...people shouldn't make claims like hers
without the DNA to back them up.

271
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:46,243
So, what do you think, Clark?

272
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,340
No chance we could be brothers?

273
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,947
As cool as that would be,
Lex, we're not.

274
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,857
Rachel.

275
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:11,662
When the guard called and told me
you were down at the gate...

276
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:14,202
...I didn't believe him.
We had an agreement.

277
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,431
I just got the results
from the DNA test.

278
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,076
I don't know how, but you
did something to alter them.

279
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,042
Did what? What are you
talking about?

280
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,477
Clark Kent is our son,
and you know that!

281
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,947
You haven't changed, Rachel.
You are still completely irrational.

282
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:35,957
No, the only irrational thing that I ever did
was to let you rip my child from my arms.

283
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,925
You were well-compensated
and well taken care of.

284
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,930
You think money made up for
seven years in a psychiatric ward?

285
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,362
You needed help.

286
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,368
No, what I needed was
a home and a family.

287
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,234
After you were through with me
that wasn't going to happen.

288
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:50,999
Not with Lucas, not with anybody.

289
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,076
Why didn't you
continue your treatment?

290
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:56,839
I didn't need any treatment.
You just wanted me out of the way.

291
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,573
Classic denial.

292
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,844
Oh, this isn't over, Lionel.
I'm gonna expose you.

293
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:07,390
Expose me? To whom?
My wife is dead. You know that.

294
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,226
Are you still as beautiful, Rachel?

295
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,401
Oh, you were lovely.

296
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,168
You have to move on.

297
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,943
Forget the past.

298
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:30,946
If you need help, I'd be happy
to call Dr. Friedberg.

299
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:36,144
I'm sure he'd be more than willing
to make room for you at the clinic.

300
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,309
Ms. Dunlevy?

301
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,748
Is everything all right?

302
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,815
There.

303
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,487
Wow, that is quite a catch.

304
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:24,067
Took all my strength to pull that one in.
My dad even had to help me land it.

305
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,464
You're lucky you've got
such a great father.

306
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:32,004
I heard you and Chloe had a big fight.

307
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,781
Don't worry, she didn't
give me any details.

308
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:42,715
I assume that this is shrouded
in the usual Kent cloak of secrecy.

309
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:48,186
Chloe promised not to look
into my adoption, and then she did.

310
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:51,328
Now I've got a woman in town
claiming to be my mother.

311
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:55,156
- Is there any chance?
- No, not in a million years.

312
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,229
She just showed up
out of the blue?

313
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:03,500
She ambushed me at school. "Hi, Clark,
I'm your mother." I mean, who does that?

314
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,480
Do you remember that guy
in the photo with my mom?

315
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:20,719
I found out who he was. His name's
Henry Small. I went to his house.

316
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,021
- How'd it go?
- Well...

317
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:29,462
...he hates the Talon, hates the Luthors,
compared me to the Nazis...

318
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,864
...and told me to never
come back again.

319
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,765
That good, huh?

320
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:42,272
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

321
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,915
I have done pretty well
without a father this long...

322
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,916
...I don't know why I thought
I needed one now.

323
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,379
I do.

324
00:29:56,094 --> 00:30:00,224
Lana, we're different. We don't get to see
our biological parents every day...

325
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,993
...and see a little piece of who we are
or who we may become.

326
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:08,231
If I had a chance to get to know
my birth parents...

327
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,199
...I wouldn't give up just because the first
meeting didn't go the way I hoped.

328
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,725
There.

329
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,827
- No, no, no. You're okay.
- Where am I?

330
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,163
You're at my house.

331
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:43,066
I bought it with the money
your father gave me.

332
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,573
I knew I'd need it one day,
so I never spent it.

333
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,735
I'm fixing it up so that Clark
will feel at home here.

334
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:50,847
I know how hard it must be.

335
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,246
No, no. No, you don't.

336
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,320
All those lost years.

337
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:01,185
Martha Kent getting to
bake the birthday cakes.

338
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,328
Martha Kent getting to dry his tears.

339
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:06,963
So that gives you the right
to kidnap me?

340
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:11,431
Believe me, I didn't want to do this,
but your father gave me no choice.

341
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:15,266
Look, if my father's lying,
Clark really is my brother.

342
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,102
I want to know just as much
as you do.

343
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,536
How does holding me prisoner help you?

344
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,910
Because, Lex, either your father
tells the truth...

345
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:29,019
...or he's going to know
the pain of losing his son.

346
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,257
What's wrong?

347
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,892
Rachel Dunlevy.
She's kidnapped Lex.

348
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,333
Oh, my God.

349
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:53,239
If I don't call a press conference announcing
that Clark's adoption was a sham...

350
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:57,472
...and that he's my illegitimate son,
she's...

351
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,810
She's gonna kill Lex.

352
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,692
Chloe, I'm so glad I found you.

353
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:11,753
Okay, there's a sentence
I never thought I'd hear again.

354
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:16,863
We both did and said things
that we regret.

355
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,868
I know I did.

356
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,938
Look, you have to believe that
I would burn my press pass...

357
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,040
...if I thought it would
come between us.

358
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:28,109
No, you wouldn't. It's too much of who
you are, and right now I need it.

359
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:35,818
If Rachel Dunlevy did buy a house,
she'll be listed with the county clerk.

360
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:39,582
It's just gonna take a minute
to get a hit.

361
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,460
Chloe, what I said about your mother,
I was way out of line.

362
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,899
It's cool. We all have
family secrets, I guess.

363
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,203
She left when I was 5.

364
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:58,138
I came downstairs, and there
was my dad trying to make waffles.

365
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,943
He never even really explained
why she left. It was weird.

366
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,181
I'm sorry.

367
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,958
It's hard thinking you weren't
good enough for someone to love.

368
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,254
Don't ever think that.

369
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,940
There is no record of Rachel Dunlevy.

370
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,572
Try the name Lucas Luthor.

371
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:41,816
Okay, you're gonna have to explain
that one to me later.

372
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:52,520
Bingo. There's his address.

373
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,462
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for coming on such short notice.

374
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:07,043
I have an important announcement
to make that concerns my family.

375
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:13,015
My son, Lex Luthor, has been kidnapped.

376
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,948
I want to say to his abductor:

377
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,283
I will never give in to your demands.

378
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,049
- No.
- Lf you harm him...

379
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,522
- No! No!
...in any way...

380
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,586
...I will not rest...

381
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:30,567
...until you are hunted down
and locked away, this time forever.

382
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:35,169
It's always been the policy of my company
and my family never to negotiate...

383
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:39,537
- Where are you going? No!
- Your father just killed you, Lex.

384
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,209
Who are you?

385
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:21,045
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
I'm not your son.

386
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,379
No.

387
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,218
Oh, no.

388
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:42,004
- Lf you need anything else, give me a shout.
- Thanks.

389
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:45,438
Cute place, very colorful.

390
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:47,574
Mr. Small.

391
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:50,009
Call me Henry.

392
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:53,675
Can I get you a coffee?

393
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,749
- Of course, you wouldn't want a coffee.
- Regular coffee would be great.

394
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,385
I got your letter.

395
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,854
And yes, you did ambush me.

396
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:12,762
But from the way you describe yourself,
it might just be a habit you got from me.

397
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,398
So you are my father?

398
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,377
I don't know.

399
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,913
But I'm willing to find out.

400
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:37,594
Rachel's been admitted to
a private psychiatric clinic.

401
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:41,823
Even if she tries to explain what you did,
nobody will believe her.

402
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,271
- I really feel sorry for her.
- We all do, son.

403
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:50,464
I can't even imagine what it was like
giving up that baby.

404
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:54,141
I'm just glad our own family
is still in one piece.

405
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,576
Not even Lionel Luthor
could tear us apart.

406
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:08,253
But Lionel helped us.

407
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:11,088
Dad, why do you hate him so much?

408
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,970
The morning he came by
with the adoption papers...

409
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:28,377
...I thought I'd never lay eyes
on him again.

410
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,307
Mr. Kent.

411
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,883
Mr. Luthor.

412
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:39,580
You call me Lionel, please.

413
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,155
Lionel.

414
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,491
I think you'll find everything in order.

415
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,095
Thank you.

416
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:56,070
And thank you for bringing it out yourself.
You really didn't have to do that.

417
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,765
We're taking Lex back
to Metropolis today.

418
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,002
Hey, that's fantastic. I'm glad
your son's gonna be all right.

419
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,204
Thank you. Thank you.

420
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,980
There is one thing I'd like you
to do for me.

421
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:10,620
- Yeah?
- I'm sure you've heard...

422
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,417
...the Ross brothers are having second
thoughts about selling me their factory.

423
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:18,722
They don't want to sell to an outsider.
They're friends of yours, aren't they?

424
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:23,192
- Yeah. Yeah, they are.
- Talk to them.

425
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:27,599
Convince them that I only
have Smallville's best interests at heart.

426
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,366
I think it would make a difference.

427
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:34,738
I really don't think that's
really any of my business, Mr. Luthor.

428
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,677
I understand.

429
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:45,750
I'd be careful with that. I wouldn't
want the Department of Family Welfare...

430
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:49,051
...to find out young Clark's
adoption's a sham.

431
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:53,761
Wait, are you threatening me?

432
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:59,127
Of course not.
I'm just asking for a small favor.

433
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,811
So you did it.

434
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,985
You convinced the Rosses to sell.

435
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,987
I helped the Luthors get
a foothold on this community.

436
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:27,757
The smokestacks, the toxic dumping...

437
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:32,665
...all the people who were cheated,
including Pete's family...

438
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:37,034
- It wouldn't have happened, if not for me.
- You couldn't have known.

439
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:41,473
I should have known. I knew exactly
what kind of a man Lionel Luthor was.

440
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:42,976
Why didn't you tell me?

441
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:47,584
I knew you would do exactly what
you're doing now, which is blame yourself.

442
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,112
- You were protecting me, it is my fault.
- No.

443
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:53,351
You never believe that.

444
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:56,288
This was my decision.
This is my fault.

445
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:00,089
Mine alone.

446
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,630
Lex, is that you?

447
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,393
Still alive and kicking, Dad.
No thanks to you.

448
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,267
You're a survivor, son.
I knew she wasn't gonna kill you.

449
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,971
Not for lack of trying.

450
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:49,909
I couldn't give in to her.
You must know that.

451
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,139
Like you did all those years ago?

452
00:40:55,152 --> 00:41:00,522
I loved your mother
very deeply, Lex...

453
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:03,660
...but I was not a perfect husband.

454
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,887
I strayed.

455
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:10,265
If you've never been tempted,
I'm sure one day you will be.

456
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:15,531
We're not talking about me, Dad.
We're talking about Rachel Dunlevy.

457
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,402
Did she bear your illegitimate son
or not?

458
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,404
I never knew she was pregnant.

459
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,641
Then she reappeared one day
with a child she claimed was mine...

460
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:30,309
...demanding that I leave
your mother and marry her.

461
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:35,248
So you bribed her to give
the child up for adoption.

462
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:38,395
She was imbalanced.
She threatened me.

463
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:41,030
Your mother was too sick
to burden her with a scandal.

464
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,134
Your altruism is inspiring, Dad.

465
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,463
I did what I thought
best for everyone.

466
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,936
I had the child placed
with a suitable family.

467
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,703
- Not the Kents?
- The Kents?

468
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,446
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Then where is he?

469
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,010
He...

470
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,421
...died...

471
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,150
...before his first birthday.

472
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,663
Forgive me, Lex, I'm very tired.

473
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,740
It's been a long day.

474
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:29,837
Sure, Dad.

475
