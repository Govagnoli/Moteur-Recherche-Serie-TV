1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,697
Louise McCallum...

2
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:08,860
...no one ever really
said much about her.

3
00:00:09,038 --> 00:00:11,734
Just that I had a
great-aunt who died young.

4
00:00:11,907 --> 00:00:15,343
I'm guessing they never
mentioned she had a husband.

5
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:19,470
No, but I don't think
you can blame them.

6
00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:23,175
-You were convicted of her murder.
-Yeah.

7
00:00:23,452 --> 00:00:26,580
If you were so anxious to see me,
why'd you wait all these years to write?

8
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:29,782
Your Aunt Nell, she asked me not to.

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,289
I don't mean to be rude,
Mr. McCallum...

10
00:00:35,464 --> 00:00:40,060
...but even if I did believe your story,
I don't know what you want me to do.

11
00:00:40,236 --> 00:00:46,334
I just need somebody in Louise's
family to know I truly loved my wife...

12
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:48,704
...and I'm not the man who killed her.

13
00:00:55,284 --> 00:00:56,649
Louise!

14
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:01,956
Louise!

15
00:01:03,392 --> 00:01:09,228
It was 42 years ago,
and I can still hear those shots.

16
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:14,729
Louise.

17
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:18,901
Louise! No!

18
00:01:22,077 --> 00:01:23,908
Sheriff Tate arrived...

19
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,707
Dex, Louise, you out here?

20
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:30,318
...and found me with the gun
and Louise dead in my arms.

21
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:32,044
Dex.

22
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,885
What have you done?

23
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:42,327
I swear to you
that's what happened that night.

24
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:46,360
And when I saw
your picture in the paper...

25
00:01:47,236 --> 00:01:50,637
...I couldn't get over how
much you looked like Louise.

26
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:54,333
I thought, if you are anything like her...

27
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,377
...you'd be the one person
who could understand.

28
00:02:00,216 --> 00:02:04,653
If you're saying that you didn't
kill her, then who did?

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,487
The man I saw leaving the barn.

30
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:09,817
A drifter.

31
00:02:09,992 --> 00:02:12,552
He killed my Louise.

32
00:03:14,156 --> 00:03:17,421
What happened to this guy?
This drifter?

33
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:20,391
They never caught him.
Dexter said that people assumed...

34
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:22,827
...that he made the story up
to cover his tracks.

35
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:25,990
-But you believe him.
-Well, why would he lie to me?

36
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:29,331
It's not like he's gonna get
the last 40 years of his life back.

37
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:34,442
Convicted murderers spend half their day
trying to convince people they're innocent.

38
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:37,710
Clark, that drawing
looks exactly like you.

39
00:03:38,781 --> 00:03:42,740
So unless Dexter could've
predicted the future...

40
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:46,012
...there's a pretty good chance
that drifter was real.

41
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:50,389
It could've been your grandfather.

42
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:54,121
-Even your father.
-That's impossible.

43
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,466
Why? You must've come
from somewhere.

44
00:03:58,634 --> 00:04:01,535
It's not like you just
fell out of the sky.

45
00:04:14,683 --> 00:04:16,742
I think Lana's right.
It is Jor-El.

46
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:18,910
From 1 961?

47
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:22,216
These cave walls said that people
from Krypton had been here before.

48
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:24,655
-Why not my father?
-Clark.

49
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:27,853
Don't you think you're trying too hard
to make a connection here?

50
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,431
You saw the medallion he was wearing.
The symbol's Kryptonian.

51
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:35,596
Okay, let's just say that it was Jor-El.

52
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:39,730
From what I know, it's not a stretch
to believe he could kill somebody--

53
00:04:39,908 --> 00:04:42,706
That's the thing. We don't know
that much about him.

54
00:04:42,878 --> 00:04:45,779
All Jor-El has been to me
is some distant powerful threat.

55
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:48,610
But if he was here,
walking the same streets as me...

56
00:04:48,784 --> 00:04:50,752
...maybe we're not so different.

57
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:52,716
Maybe he's more human
than we thought.

58
00:04:52,888 --> 00:04:54,185
Clark....

59
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,515
Clark.

60
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,960
Isn't that what you're looking for?

61
00:05:08,103 --> 00:05:10,230
I knew I'd seen it down here.

62
00:05:30,926 --> 00:05:33,417
Clark. Clark!

63
00:05:39,902 --> 00:05:41,767
What is that?

64
00:05:49,445 --> 00:05:52,209
The images I saw
must've been from the past.

65
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:56,245
Clark, you really need to lay off
the late-night television.

66
00:05:56,418 --> 00:05:57,680
I'm not kidding, Pete.

67
00:05:57,853 --> 00:06:02,256
I had all these flashes, but they went by
so fast, I couldn't make sense of them.

68
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:32,076
-Give it over.
-Get away from me!

69
00:06:32,254 --> 00:06:34,222
Give me the money.
I know you've got it.

70
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:51,238
My hero.

71
00:06:52,374 --> 00:06:56,003
You don't strike me as someone
who usually needs saving.

72
00:06:56,178 --> 00:06:57,770
Thank you.

73
00:07:05,154 --> 00:07:08,612
-Did you see that? He could've killed me!
-Tell it to the judge.

74
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,725
Thanks.

75
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:13,258
I'm Louise.

76
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:17,089
You can call me Joe.

77
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:20,926
Well, Joe...

78
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:23,799
...you're the most excitement
we've had all year.

79
00:07:23,972 --> 00:07:25,701
Watch your head.

80
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:30,603
Well, I guess we owe you our gratitude.

81
00:07:31,113 --> 00:07:35,140
Hi, I'm Sheriff Billy Tate.
Those are some reflexes you got there.

82
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:37,314
They kind of surprised me too.

83
00:07:37,486 --> 00:07:39,784
I haven't seen you
around Smallville before.

84
00:07:41,557 --> 00:07:45,584
-I'm just passing through on my way home.
-Lucky you.

85
00:07:46,094 --> 00:07:48,585
Forgive Louise.
She's got stars in her eyes.

86
00:07:48,764 --> 00:07:50,254
Always has.

87
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:52,563
There's nothing wrong with that.

88
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:02,971
Louise?

89
00:08:03,812 --> 00:08:05,871
Everything all right?

90
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:11,176
You go on home, Louise. I know how
Dex hates to miss his bridge game.

91
00:08:11,353 --> 00:08:13,321
I'll drive by and get your statement.

92
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:19,153
See you around.

93
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,883
I appreciate your help.

94
00:08:43,452 --> 00:08:45,477
Clark, what's going on?

95
00:08:45,654 --> 00:08:48,179
It's like I was back in the '50s.

96
00:08:48,357 --> 00:08:50,552
I was standing right here where Joe was.

97
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:52,588
Joe?

98
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:55,057
It's the name of the drifter.

99
00:08:56,798 --> 00:09:00,290
Pete, you remember when I was
in the cave and I got all those flashes?

100
00:09:00,802 --> 00:09:03,737
I think this medallion
downloaded me with all his memories.

101
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:06,436
When I touch something of his,
it triggers one.

102
00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:08,332
Right.

103
00:09:09,645 --> 00:09:11,340
Louise was here too.

104
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,846
The drifter, he saved her.

105
00:09:14,016 --> 00:09:15,984
Well, of course he did.

106
00:09:16,151 --> 00:09:21,111
Clark, back here in the 21 st century,
we call that a daydream.

107
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:25,350
There's got to be a way to find out
if what I saw really happened.

108
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:33,159
Since when can you take
police records out of city hall?

109
00:09:33,335 --> 00:09:37,829
Since I caught the clerk and his girlfriend
playing cops and robbers on the job.

110
00:09:38,006 --> 00:09:40,099
Well, the robbery
should be around June, 1 961.

111
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:42,402
That's when the movie
was playing at the Talon.

112
00:09:42,577 --> 00:09:45,512
I don't mean to give you the third
degree, but how do you know--?

113
00:09:45,681 --> 00:09:48,343
I told you, it's just a hunch
that the drifter was there.

114
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:52,920
I get that. It's the robbery outside the Talon
with the Natalie Wood movie playing...

115
00:09:53,088 --> 00:09:56,080
...that's a little more detailed
than your average hunch.

116
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:59,785
Well, as curator of the Wall of Weird,
just go with me on this one.

117
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:01,424
Okay.

118
00:10:01,596 --> 00:10:04,190
There's pages missing
from the day of Louise's murder.

119
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:06,493
Well, someone gets a D in subtlety.

120
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:10,702
-All right, here's the robbery.
-You see our heroic drifter anywhere?

121
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:13,170
No, but look at the name of the robber.

122
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:16,900
Lachlan Luthor.
That's Lex's grandpa.

123
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:19,875
Oh, come on, I had
a three-megabyte file on Lex.

124
00:10:20,048 --> 00:10:21,481
I know his favorite cereal.

125
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,442
Maybe he knows something.

126
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:26,781
Well, you're gonna have to find out.
I gotta meet Lana.

127
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:28,616
Nell found some of Louise's things.

128
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,655
This is where I'm going to have to bail.

129
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:33,317
Last time I researched
the Luthors, Lex almost got killed.

130
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:36,953
Please, you're gonna have to
deal with him sooner or later.

131
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:51,176
I always assumed my father's knack
for taking people's money was inherited...

132
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:54,873
...but I hardly think petty crime
runs in the family.

133
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,178
Well, Smallville isn't exactly
teeming with Lachlan Luthors.

134
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:01,049
Your grandfather has to be
the one who was arrested.

135
00:11:02,257 --> 00:11:03,519
Chloe...

136
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:07,053
...no one in my family
set foot in this town...

137
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:09,561
...until my father bought
the creamed corn factory.

138
00:11:09,731 --> 00:11:12,700
Isn't an age-old robbery
a little off your usual teen beat?

139
00:11:12,868 --> 00:11:15,996
This one's pro bono. Lana's really
worried about her great-uncle.

140
00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:20,635
Something tells me you're not here
because of Lana.

141
00:11:21,443 --> 00:11:25,243
Anyway, we think Lachlan met
the drifter, and we were hoping--

142
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:26,904
What?

143
00:11:27,082 --> 00:11:29,710
That my family
sat around at Thanksgiving...

144
00:11:29,885 --> 00:11:32,319
...sharing old crime stories?

145
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:37,117
Your family isn't exactly
a Norman Rockwell painting.

146
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:42,553
Look, Lex, we're just
trying to find what we can.

147
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:45,431
I wish I could help you, Chloe...

148
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,160
...but I'm afraid you've met a dead end.

149
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:06,178
-Hey.
-Hi, Lana.

150
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,621
Look, I'm really sorry about
being so defensive this morning.

151
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:13,522
You don't have to apologize.

152
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,220
I kind of dumped a lot on you all at once.

153
00:12:17,065 --> 00:12:20,626
I guess it's just when you're adopted,
you dream about where you came from...

154
00:12:20,802 --> 00:12:23,168
...and what your birth parents were like.

155
00:12:24,306 --> 00:12:27,104
The biggest nightmare
is that they were criminals.

156
00:12:27,275 --> 00:12:32,303
With all the strange surprises I've had
in my family, I know it's not easy.

157
00:12:36,952 --> 00:12:39,250
There are only
a few of Louise's things.

158
00:12:39,421 --> 00:12:42,515
But I think we'll be able
to find something.

159
00:12:57,572 --> 00:12:59,233
It's a love letter.

160
00:13:00,642 --> 00:13:02,439
Dexter must have written this.

161
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:08,310
Wow. Who knew he could be so....

162
00:13:09,217 --> 00:13:10,514
Passionate?

163
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,323
Only an initial?

164
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:32,268
Could you?

165
00:13:56,364 --> 00:13:58,559
I couldn't stop
thinking about you all day.

166
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:15,207
I've never felt this way about anyone.

167
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:18,913
All I know is I want to be with you.

168
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:45,003
Clark?

169
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:49,944
Lana, I don't think that love letter
is from her husband.

170
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:53,614
I think it's from the drifter.

171
00:15:55,183 --> 00:15:56,912
They were in love.

172
00:16:05,427 --> 00:16:08,260
Congratulations, Lex.
That was an excellent presentation.

173
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,694
The board was impressed.

174
00:16:10,865 --> 00:16:14,733
It was smoke and mirrors,
but skillfully done.

175
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:19,135
What can I say? I guess the
art of deception runs in the family.

176
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:23,472
And the day was off
to such a sweet start.

177
00:16:26,514 --> 00:16:28,379
Deception, huh?

178
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,241
You think I've been
deceiving you about something?

179
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:32,818
You tell me.

180
00:16:32,987 --> 00:16:35,114
You've always described
grandfather Lachlan...

181
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,850
...as a hardworking entrepreneur
from Scottish nobility.

182
00:16:38,026 --> 00:16:39,516
What are you driving at, son?

183
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:41,855
Maybe you could explain
why a Lachlan Luthor...

184
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,431
...was arrested in 1 961
for petty robbery in Smallville.

185
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,731
Not all entrepreneurs can have the luxury
of being both successful and honest.

186
00:16:50,905 --> 00:16:54,170
Why would you go to such lengths
to hide our past?

187
00:16:55,777 --> 00:16:57,972
When I was young...

188
00:16:58,146 --> 00:17:03,641
...and trying hard to get a foothold
in the world of overachieving lvy Leaguers...

189
00:17:03,818 --> 00:17:07,254
...I quickly found that confessing
to the fact that I was born and bred...

190
00:17:07,422 --> 00:17:12,826
...in a place like Suicide Slum wasn't gonna
win anybody over at a cocktail party.

191
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:15,360
So you took the liberty
of rewriting our history?

192
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,125
That's right. Why should l
have to pay for the sins of my father?

193
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,097
Sounds familiar.

194
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,365
Is the memorial
in our family plot even real...

195
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,509
...or do I have grandparents
wandering around Suicide Slum?

196
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,637
No, no, they....

197
00:17:35,383 --> 00:17:36,873
They both died...

198
00:17:37,852 --> 00:17:40,116
...in a tenement fire.

199
00:17:45,794 --> 00:17:50,925
The only reason I'm alive
is I was moonlighting at the....

200
00:17:52,867 --> 00:17:56,234
At a print shop when it happened.

201
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:05,607
Ever since then,
I've buried myself in work.

202
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:09,783
Consciously.

203
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:20,458
This is the barn
where Louise was shot.

204
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:29,596
Clark, it's been over 40 years.
What do you expect to find here?

205
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:07,404
I have to leave tonight.

206
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,669
I'm leaving with you.

207
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,841
I told you, that's not possible.

208
00:19:14,015 --> 00:19:17,951
I can't stay with Dex anymore.
I don't love him.

209
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:21,384
You're the one I want to be with.

210
00:19:21,556 --> 00:19:23,114
We wouldn't be accepted.

211
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,488
I don't care what people think.
I never have.

212
00:19:27,395 --> 00:19:29,420
Dex says that's my curse.

213
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,127
No, Louise...

214
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:35,935
...that's a gift.

215
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:39,573
We're not that different, Joe.

216
00:19:39,741 --> 00:19:41,038
I'm willing to try.

217
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,204
This wasn't supposed to happen.

218
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,413
I have to return home alone.

219
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:51,984
Why?

220
00:19:53,588 --> 00:19:55,818
Because it's my destiny,
and I can't change it.

221
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:03,854
Louise, as much I want this,
I can't have it.

222
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:12,135
My father told me
that someday I'd understand...

223
00:20:12,307 --> 00:20:14,571
...that my actions have consequences.

224
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,044
I guess this is what he meant.

225
00:20:22,717 --> 00:20:24,014
It's not fair.

226
00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:30,283
We should be together.

227
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:39,856
Louise.

228
00:21:00,054 --> 00:21:02,147
Joe....

229
00:21:05,293 --> 00:21:06,885
No.

230
00:21:07,395 --> 00:21:08,828
Louise?

231
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:14,557
Don't leave me.

232
00:21:15,203 --> 00:21:16,966
I'll never leave.

233
00:21:19,907 --> 00:21:21,465
I love you.

234
00:21:27,315 --> 00:21:29,010
Louise.

235
00:21:29,183 --> 00:21:30,616
No.

236
00:21:31,085 --> 00:21:32,814
No, Louise.

237
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,680
Louise.

238
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:45,890
Clark.

239
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:50,133
I know who killed her.

240
00:21:52,206 --> 00:21:55,039
The Edgecliff Condos.

241
00:21:55,977 --> 00:21:58,411
They're owned by LuthorCorp...

242
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:01,173
...but I'm missing the connection
to my grandparents.

243
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:03,681
Well, before the condos
and the coffeehouses...

244
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:07,116
...this was the worst
part of Suicide Slums.

245
00:22:07,288 --> 00:22:08,983
That high-rise...

246
00:22:09,157 --> 00:22:12,285
...stands on the site of the tenement
your grandparents died in.

247
00:22:17,932 --> 00:22:20,332
So my father's story is true.

248
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:23,768
They died in a fire.

249
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:25,838
If you call an explosion...

250
00:22:26,007 --> 00:22:30,000
...that blows the windows
out of two city blocks a fire, yeah.

251
00:22:30,678 --> 00:22:35,206
-lt sounds like you have your doubts.
-I was a detective in that precinct.

252
00:22:35,383 --> 00:22:38,375
Back in those days when they told
you to drop a case, you did it.

253
00:22:38,553 --> 00:22:40,953
The slumlords controlled city hall.

254
00:22:41,122 --> 00:22:43,818
Well, I'm retired now.
It doesn't really matter.

255
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:48,051
I think you'll find
my original report enlightening.

256
00:22:58,773 --> 00:23:00,536
I don't mean to rain on your parade...

257
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,370
...but Lachlan was in the jail
at the time of the murder.

258
00:23:03,544 --> 00:23:04,943
-I know it was him.
-How?

259
00:23:05,113 --> 00:23:07,513
You can't expect us
to follow these weird hunches...

260
00:23:07,682 --> 00:23:09,616
...without telling us what's going on.

261
00:23:09,784 --> 00:23:11,046
It's crazy.

262
00:23:11,219 --> 00:23:13,483
You passed "crazy"
about four random clues ago.

263
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:19,191
Ever since I read that newspaper article,
I've been having memories from 1 961.

264
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:25,356
What?

265
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:27,296
It's like some weird deja vu thing.

266
00:23:27,468 --> 00:23:30,198
Could it be like reincarnation?
You know, like past lives?

267
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:33,169
-Chloe.
-Or genetic memory.

268
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:38,005
Science has theorized that we store
our ancestors' memories in our DNA.

269
00:23:40,214 --> 00:23:41,841
Anyway.

270
00:23:44,552 --> 00:23:48,044
Well, wherever your hunches are
coming from, they're eerily accurate.

271
00:23:48,756 --> 00:23:51,725
I asked the Ledger to e-mail me
the newspaper's police blotter...

272
00:23:51,893 --> 00:23:53,861
...from the day missing in the logbook.

273
00:23:54,028 --> 00:23:56,861
Lachlan was released from jail
the morning Louise was murdered.

274
00:23:57,031 --> 00:23:59,556
He only spent a few nights
in jail for armed robbery?

275
00:23:59,734 --> 00:24:02,897
Yeah, and look at the name
of the deputy who released him.

276
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,970
Billy Tate.

277
00:24:05,273 --> 00:24:10,404
Or affectionately known now
as our Honorable Mayor William Tate.

278
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,250
Dex and Louise were my best friends.

279
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:23,154
Arresting him was
the hardest thing I ever had to do.

280
00:24:25,026 --> 00:24:27,494
You bear a striking resemblance
to your great-aunt.

281
00:24:28,095 --> 00:24:30,222
Has anyone ever told you that?

282
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:35,729
Do you remember booking
someone named Lachlan Luthor?

283
00:24:35,903 --> 00:24:38,599
He was released
the same day Louise was killed.

284
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,674
It's hard to keep track
of all the arrests I've made.

285
00:24:41,943 --> 00:24:44,935
We think your friend
Dexter is innocent.

286
00:24:47,014 --> 00:24:50,780
Trust me, of all people, I wanted
to believe that more than anyone.

287
00:24:50,952 --> 00:24:53,546
But, finally, I had to admit
there was no drifter.

288
00:24:54,322 --> 00:24:57,086
He made up the story
to cover his own guilt.

289
00:25:11,105 --> 00:25:13,198
Careful with that, young man.

290
00:25:13,975 --> 00:25:15,636
Hey, you two lovebirds.

291
00:25:17,545 --> 00:25:21,845
-Billy, it's not what it looks like.
-Sure. Okay, big shot, out of the car.

292
00:25:25,653 --> 00:25:27,814
I don't know
what business this is of yours--

293
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:31,720
You've overstayed your welcome.
Move along before you cause trouble.

294
00:25:31,893 --> 00:25:33,724
Billy...

295
00:25:33,895 --> 00:25:35,385
...he was just taking me home.

296
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:39,531
You better make sure
this is what you want, Louise...

297
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,895
...because I think
you're making a huge mistake.

298
00:25:55,116 --> 00:25:57,812
I never wanted to marry Dexter.

299
00:25:57,985 --> 00:26:01,853
Don't get me wrong.
He's a nice man. He's just...

300
00:26:02,023 --> 00:26:03,354
...safe.

301
00:26:03,724 --> 00:26:06,625
I made the mistake
of telling my father my dreams.

302
00:26:07,061 --> 00:26:09,825
I wanna go to Hollywood...

303
00:26:09,997 --> 00:26:11,521
...become a star.

304
00:26:15,102 --> 00:26:18,071
The next thing I know,
he's putting me together with Dex...

305
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:20,766
...saying what a great wife I'd make.

306
00:26:23,477 --> 00:26:25,411
I finally gave in.

307
00:26:27,982 --> 00:26:29,472
And here I am.

308
00:26:33,688 --> 00:26:35,656
I think our fathers would get along.

309
00:26:39,193 --> 00:26:42,356
See, I'm not
what you'd call a model son.

310
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,260
My father sent me here
as sort of a lesson.

311
00:26:47,368 --> 00:26:48,926
I didn't want to come here.

312
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:53,006
Now I'd give anything to stay.

313
00:26:56,644 --> 00:26:58,168
But I can't.

314
00:27:02,216 --> 00:27:04,446
Then take me with you.

315
00:27:05,786 --> 00:27:11,452
We'll be like James Dean and Natalie
Wood in Rebel Without a Cause.

316
00:27:11,826 --> 00:27:14,954
-lt'll be romantic.
-I don't think you understand.

317
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:20,889
When I said I wasn't from here,
I wasn't talking about Smallville.

318
00:27:26,107 --> 00:27:28,974
Where I'm from, we have colors
that you've never seen.

319
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:33,507
Our moons are so close
they fill up half the sky.

320
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:37,974
We have sunsets that last for hours.

321
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:48,559
You almost had me there.

322
00:27:49,597 --> 00:27:52,623
For a second,
I was actually believing you.

323
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:27,994
Oh, my God.

324
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:49,048
So you want me
to dredge up an investigation...

325
00:28:49,223 --> 00:28:51,623
...that was put to bed 40 years ago?

326
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:53,589
The mayor knows more than he's telling.

327
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:56,355
Oh, yes, that mysterious drifter of yours.

328
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:00,159
We think that Mayor Tate made a deal
to drop the charges on Lachlan Luthor...

329
00:29:00,334 --> 00:29:03,599
...if Lachlan killed the drifter.
They were gonna pin it on Dexter.

330
00:29:03,771 --> 00:29:07,434
Well, you make a great storyteller,
Mr. Kent, but not much of a detective.

331
00:29:07,608 --> 00:29:11,908
See, I will need two small things
called motive and evidence...

332
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,571
...before I'm gonna haul the leader
of our community off to jail.

333
00:29:16,283 --> 00:29:18,808
The writing on the police log
matches this love letter.

334
00:29:18,986 --> 00:29:21,318
-It's the same signature.
-He was in love with her.

335
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:24,151
With the drifter dead
and Dexter in jail for his murder...

336
00:29:24,325 --> 00:29:26,623
...Mayor Tate could have Louise
all to himself.

337
00:29:26,794 --> 00:29:28,694
I don't know if you
can hear yourselves...

338
00:29:28,863 --> 00:29:32,424
...but you might want to be careful
about who you're pointing fingers at.

339
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,593
If you'll excuse me, I've got
a few cases in this century to attend to.

340
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:46,436
Martha, we can't even tell
if these visions are for real.

341
00:29:46,614 --> 00:29:49,481
For all we know, they could
be just another test from Jor-El.

342
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,813
Jonathan, when have you seen
Clark this determined for no reason?

343
00:29:52,987 --> 00:29:55,080
I know this is hard,
but we can't blame him...

344
00:29:55,256 --> 00:29:57,850
...for wanting to know
about his birth parents.

345
00:29:58,025 --> 00:29:59,686
Every time I hear the name Jor-El...

346
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,352
...all I can think of is that we
aren't his real birth parents.

347
00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:06,500
We're just the people who were
lucky enough to find him.

348
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:09,363
But right now he's here with us.

349
00:30:09,537 --> 00:30:10,902
Yeah.

350
00:30:12,072 --> 00:30:15,041
Clark. Have you had
any more of the visions?

351
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,972
No.

352
00:30:22,383 --> 00:30:26,649
Listen, son, I'm sorry I doubted you.

353
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,517
If you like, we can go over to McCallum's
barn, see if you missed anything.

354
00:30:33,327 --> 00:30:35,295
What is it?

355
00:30:37,565 --> 00:30:39,362
That's grandpa's gun.

356
00:30:40,034 --> 00:30:42,264
I saw it in the cave
when I had my first vision.

357
00:30:55,716 --> 00:30:57,741
I don't want any trouble.

358
00:30:57,918 --> 00:30:59,351
Easy there, son.

359
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:01,521
You already got one murder
on your hands...

360
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:03,953
...if you're the one
the whole town's looking for.

361
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:07,556
I didn't do it.

362
00:31:09,496 --> 00:31:11,191
I'm not a killer.

363
00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:15,357
I loved her.
I'd never hurt her. You got--

364
00:31:15,536 --> 00:31:17,026
You gotta trust me.

365
00:31:27,514 --> 00:31:29,175
I'm Hiram.

366
00:31:30,517 --> 00:31:31,882
Hiram Kent.

367
00:31:39,793 --> 00:31:41,556
-What is it?
-The drifter was here.

368
00:31:41,729 --> 00:31:44,323
He was here on the farm
with Grandpa Kent.

369
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:54,335
I haven't opened this...

370
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,401
...since the day
my father passed away.

371
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,208
Maybe something in here
will trigger another memory.

372
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,150
Clark...

373
00:32:14,395 --> 00:32:18,331
...your grandfather wore this old thing
every single day of his life.

374
00:32:21,869 --> 00:32:23,894
It was his favorite belt.

375
00:32:29,777 --> 00:32:32,143
I wish you could have met him.

376
00:32:34,114 --> 00:32:37,277
Do you recognize
anything from your visions?

377
00:32:39,353 --> 00:32:41,821
At least you won't stand out
as much if they stop you.

378
00:32:41,989 --> 00:32:44,150
I know all the back roads.
We'll take them.

379
00:32:44,325 --> 00:32:47,692
I appreciate your help,
but I'll find my way on my own.

380
00:32:47,861 --> 00:32:49,556
I am not sending you alone.

381
00:32:50,531 --> 00:32:53,364
Are you sure these friends
of yours are gonna show up?

382
00:32:54,368 --> 00:32:56,029
They'll be there.

383
00:32:58,605 --> 00:33:02,507
You're welcome to stay
and try to clear this thing up.

384
00:33:05,446 --> 00:33:07,175
I've got no reason to stay anymore.

385
00:33:09,383 --> 00:33:10,850
Be careful.

386
00:33:14,121 --> 00:33:17,716
-Bye, Gene.
-His name is Jonathan.

387
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:20,327
We're still deciding.

388
00:33:24,331 --> 00:33:26,094
Come on, let's go.

389
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:30,659
Thank you.

390
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:35,572
Grandpa helped him escape.

391
00:33:37,845 --> 00:33:40,040
Now, look, I'd like
to believe you, Clark, but--

392
00:33:40,214 --> 00:33:42,478
He wanted to name you Gene.

393
00:33:47,755 --> 00:33:49,586
After Gene Autry.

394
00:33:51,258 --> 00:33:54,853
We had all of his old records,
but Mom finally won out.

395
00:33:55,028 --> 00:33:57,462
Hiram was a pretty good
judge of character, Jonathan.

396
00:33:57,631 --> 00:33:59,531
I don't think he'd help a guilty man.

397
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,158
Well, I don't think an old bomber
jacket is gonna prove anything.

398
00:34:03,337 --> 00:34:04,964
I'm not too sure about that.

399
00:34:37,871 --> 00:34:39,896
Sheriff Tate.

400
00:34:44,578 --> 00:34:48,139
Mr. Kent. I'm not sure how you got in,
but I don't find this very amusing.

401
00:34:48,315 --> 00:34:50,579
I think you've got me confused
with someone else.

402
00:34:50,751 --> 00:34:52,776
The police are on their way.

403
00:34:58,725 --> 00:35:00,454
Where did you get that?

404
00:35:00,627 --> 00:35:02,356
I knew you'd remember me.

405
00:35:02,696 --> 00:35:04,095
This can't be real.

406
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:07,199
You've done a pretty good job
of hiding what's real.

407
00:35:07,734 --> 00:35:10,931
I know you made a deal
with Lachlan to kill me.

408
00:35:11,972 --> 00:35:16,375
But how did you feel when you
found out that he killed Louise instead?

409
00:35:16,777 --> 00:35:18,972
It was supposed to be you.

410
00:35:28,088 --> 00:35:30,989
You can't kill me.
I'm already dead.

411
00:35:31,158 --> 00:35:32,921
Mother of God.

412
00:35:33,126 --> 00:35:36,357
If you ever want
another day of peace...

413
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,555
...you'll confess what you've done
to the sheriff.

414
00:35:38,732 --> 00:35:40,063
No.

415
00:35:40,634 --> 00:35:42,625
I'm not going to jail.

416
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,238
You're not taking the easy way out.

417
00:35:50,644 --> 00:35:52,976
Mayor Tate. You okay?

418
00:35:53,146 --> 00:35:55,114
-We got the silent alarm.
-He's trying to kill me.

419
00:35:55,282 --> 00:35:56,681
Who?

420
00:35:59,887 --> 00:36:02,651
Lachlan was supposed to kill the drifter.

421
00:36:03,557 --> 00:36:05,889
I never meant to hurt Louise.

422
00:36:07,661 --> 00:36:09,128
I loved her.

423
00:36:17,471 --> 00:36:20,838
I never expected to see this day.

424
00:36:22,776 --> 00:36:26,143
It's still so hard to believe about Billy.

425
00:36:26,313 --> 00:36:28,941
Did you know he came
to visit me every Sunday...

426
00:36:29,116 --> 00:36:31,949
...for the first two years
I was in here?

427
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,178
I'm sorry. I know he was your friend.

428
00:36:34,354 --> 00:36:37,482
I guess I always knew
how he felt about Louise...

429
00:36:37,658 --> 00:36:40,821
...but I never imagined
he could do a thing like that.

430
00:36:41,295 --> 00:36:44,822
And him confessing
after all these years....

431
00:36:46,934 --> 00:36:48,799
It doesn't make any sense.

432
00:36:49,503 --> 00:36:51,130
Maybe it had been haunting him.

433
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,909
It'd be a terrible thing when love
consumes you and takes over.

434
00:36:58,612 --> 00:37:01,172
I was so in love with Louise.

435
00:37:01,348 --> 00:37:06,251
I just couldn't see she didn't feel
the same way about me.

436
00:37:08,555 --> 00:37:11,388
I wish I'd known when to let go.

437
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,867
The explosion originated
in your family's apartment.

438
00:37:25,005 --> 00:37:27,872
There were traces
of ammonium nitrate, Dad.

439
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:30,601
Your parents' death was no accident.

440
00:37:31,979 --> 00:37:35,107
Well, I've always suspected this. I--

441
00:37:37,718 --> 00:37:40,551
I knew my father had enemies, but....

442
00:37:41,922 --> 00:37:44,288
That's not what you told the police.

443
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,227
I was young but never naive.

444
00:37:49,396 --> 00:37:53,230
I knew, automatically, that whoever
did it would be watching me.

445
00:37:57,471 --> 00:37:59,701
So you knew they were murdered.

446
00:38:01,608 --> 00:38:05,169
It's not like you
to pass up a chance at revenge.

447
00:38:05,345 --> 00:38:07,575
I had no resources.
I couldn't pursue it.

448
00:38:07,748 --> 00:38:10,376
Then. What about the last 30 years?

449
00:38:11,685 --> 00:38:13,744
I couldn't bring them back.

450
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,286
There was nothing I could do...

451
00:38:16,456 --> 00:38:20,483
...so I chose to move on, forget about it.

452
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:25,229
But you can't, can you?

453
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:29,334
No.

454
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:36,132
I owe you a thank-you, son.

455
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:40,510
Your grandparents were murdered.

456
00:38:40,681 --> 00:38:44,242
They deserve justice.
Oh, I was such a fool.

457
00:38:44,418 --> 00:38:49,446
I always thought that their murder
could stay buried in the past.

458
00:38:53,593 --> 00:38:59,725
We both know that's not gonna happen
until we find out who did this.

459
00:39:12,312 --> 00:39:13,802
Clark?

460
00:39:16,316 --> 00:39:18,944
Lana. How's Dexter?

461
00:39:19,653 --> 00:39:23,180
I think he's just relieved that
his name has finally been cleared.

462
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:25,614
Personally, I think I'd be more relieved...

463
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:27,885
...knowing I wasn't getting
locked up again.

464
00:39:28,862 --> 00:39:34,562
I am not quite sure why, but I think Dexter
has you to thank for his freedom.

465
00:39:34,735 --> 00:39:37,135
You're the one who believed in him.

466
00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:41,000
Yeah.

467
00:39:42,642 --> 00:39:45,338
He was wrong about the drifter.

468
00:39:45,512 --> 00:39:47,139
I'm not so sure he was.

469
00:39:48,315 --> 00:39:51,842
Nothing would've happened to Louise
if she didn't fall in love with him.

470
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,721
I know what Louise did was wrong...

471
00:39:57,724 --> 00:40:00,352
...but I can't help thinking
she was lucky.

472
00:40:01,695 --> 00:40:04,129
Even if it was only for a few days...

473
00:40:05,365 --> 00:40:08,823
...she knew what it felt like
to really be in love.

474
00:40:11,605 --> 00:40:15,666
-It's too bad it couldn't last.
-What if that's not the point?

475
00:40:21,081 --> 00:40:25,245
Maybe you have to be grateful
for the time that you spend together...

476
00:40:26,086 --> 00:40:28,213
...and stop holding on
to what could've been.

477
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:45,304
What is it, Clark?
What are we doing here?

478
00:40:45,906 --> 00:40:47,271
I'm not sure.

479
00:40:51,611 --> 00:40:53,909
What are you doing with that thing?

480
00:40:57,818 --> 00:41:00,912
I was supposed to return
it to my father...

481
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:03,487
...but there's too many
bad memories attached.

482
00:41:05,892 --> 00:41:08,019
Thank you, Hiram.

483
00:41:09,362 --> 00:41:11,523
I can usually tell
an honest man when I see one.

484
00:41:12,098 --> 00:41:16,592
Sorry you ran into trouble here.
There's plenty of good folks in Smallville.

485
00:41:17,037 --> 00:41:18,629
I'll remember that.

486
00:41:20,407 --> 00:41:24,434
Congratulations on the baby.
He's lucky to have you as parents.

487
00:41:25,445 --> 00:41:28,676
If there's anything you ever need,
you know where to find me.

488
00:42:15,795 --> 00:42:17,319
Clark.

489
00:42:19,266 --> 00:42:20,858
What did you see?

490
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:25,295
He buried this here because he
didn't want his father to have it.

491
00:42:25,472 --> 00:42:27,565
It acts as some sort of journal.

492
00:42:29,509 --> 00:42:33,206
I think Jor-El was sent here
as some kind of rite of passage.

493
00:42:35,415 --> 00:42:37,940
Grandpa Kent was down here too.

494
00:42:38,752 --> 00:42:42,586
He told Joe that if there
was anything he needed....

495
00:42:49,195 --> 00:42:50,924
What is it, Clark?

496
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:56,131
I don't think you and Mom
found me by accident.

497
00:42:59,072 --> 00:43:00,937
I think you were chosen.

498
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
