1
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,518
Kettle's on, chloe.

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,275
Nothing like a cup of chamomile
and a hot shower to relax you.

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,677
Thanks, Lois. I feel better already.

4
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,438
Great.

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,830
And my night is complete.

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,399
Bet the lights aren't out in Metropolis.

7
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,870
Lois, do you have a candle?

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,078
Look in the little cabinet,
bottom drawer.

9
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,198
Help me.

10
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,077
Chloe.

11
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,393
Chloe?

12
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,514
Help me.

13
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,676
Lois. Where's chloe? Is she all right?

14
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,833
That's what we were
just trying to determine. And you are?

15
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,875
- Clark Kent.
- How do you do? I'm Dr. Sydell.

16
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,834
He's chloe's psychiatrist.

17
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,552
Clark, I found her on the bathroom floor.
She cut her wrists.

18
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,511
- What?
- I feel so guilty.

19
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,159
I should have seen it coming.

20
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,998
She hasn't been getting much <i>sleep...</i>

21
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,594
...between school
and her job at the <i>Planet</i> and...

22
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,673
- Is there any history of mental illness?
- No. I'm her cousin.

23
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,559
- I'd know if there are bats in the belfry.
- Fine.

24
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,156
Well, that'll give us
something to start with. Orderly.

25
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,318
Would you take Miss Sullivan
from the ER to room 258, please.

26
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,914
- Make sure she's comfortable.
- Yes, sir.

27
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,958
Doctor, I don't understand,
why would Chloe do this to herself?

28
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,678
It's a number of factors:

29
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,116
Family history, stress,
loss of a loved one...

30
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,989
Sometimes, a person has a secret
they feel they can't share.

31
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,231
But whatever it is, I'll uncover it,
and I will treat it aggressively.

32
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,953
Hey.

33
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,678
Hey.

34
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,878
How you doing?

35
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,712
Out of it.

36
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,996
From the sedatives they gave me.

37
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,994
So, what happened?

38
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,672
I don't know.

39
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,151
- Lf you gotta talk about something...
- clark, really, I don't know.

40
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,836
I mean, I was showering and then
the lights went out and...

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,274
It's just all jumbled.

42
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,274
I just woke up on the floor bleeding.

43
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,272
Clark, I'm a writer.

44
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,319
If I was gonna kill myself,
I would leave one hell of a suicide note.

45
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,396
I think there was someone else
in the room with me, though.

46
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,392
Lois didn't see anyone.

47
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,113
You know, Chloe, the doctor asked
if you had any history...

48
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,271
...of mental illness in your family.

49
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,757
- Should we tell him about your mom?
- No.

50
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,992
- Chloe, she...
- I don't know what's happening to me.

51
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,913
But I don't want anyone
thinking I'm like my mom.

52
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,514
So just don't say anything, all right?

53
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,799
Yeah.

54
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,239
On my way back to Metropolis.

55
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,518
Didn't mean to interrupt, I just
thought I'd check on how you're doing.

56
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,557
I do have a front door.

57
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,750
Next time, I'll come to the front.

58
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,479
Maybe you should call first.

59
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,555
Yeah. Let me help you.

60
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,157
Thank you.

61
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,949
Budget, fiscal projections...

62
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,039
...public works.

63
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,998
Everything a potential senator
would need to know.

64
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,390
You considering taking his senate seat?

65
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,558
I don't know. It's complicated.

66
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,074
I know how hard it is...

67
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,677
...to get back any sense
of what's <i>normal...</i>

68
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,352
...after you lose someone you love.

69
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,792
It will get easier, Martha.

70
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,758
I know it will.

71
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,069
You just have to give yourself time.

72
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,751
<i>Help me.</i>

73
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,591
<i>Please.</i>

74
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,030
<i>Help me.</i>

75
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,116
<i>Please.</i>

76
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,475
<i>I have to find him.</i>

77
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,954
<i>Help me.</i>

78
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,478
Hello?

79
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,434
Lana.

80
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,716
I got here as fast as I could.
Everything okay?

81
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,313
- Where is she?
- Who?

82
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,675
The girl. She was just here.

83
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,353
My God, there's so much blood.

84
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,717
Chloe? Hey, we should get you
back to bed, all right?

85
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,155
No, I have to find her. I just saw her.

86
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,519
Where is she?

87
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,159
Doctor. Doctor. Oh, my God.

88
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,709
- A woman in my room needs your help.
- Relax. Orderly.

89
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,519
- Listen. There's blood all over the floor.
- I'm listening.

90
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,716
- It's going down the hall.
- There's no blood.

91
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,313
- She was in my bathroom.
- Relax.

92
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,869
- You're not listening! There's blood!
- I'm listening.

93
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,759
- There's a woman, she needs my help!
- Nurse, take her arm.

94
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,831
Listen to me, please!
Make him listen! No!

95
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,798
- Lie back.
- No! Please, you don't understand!

96
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,235
- She needs our help. No! Lana!
- Please.

97
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,278
Make them listen! Lana! Please, Lana!

98
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,793
How hard can it be to find
one college professor from a dirt state?

99
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,313
I want Fine located...

100
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,278
<i>...or</i> somebody's gonna be
wondering where you disappeared to.

101
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,833
Lana.

102
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,512
What's wrong?

103
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,193
Chloe, she's in the hospital.

104
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,554
She tried to kill herself.

105
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,511
- Is she all right?
- I don't know.

106
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,195
I tried talking to her, but she wasn't
making any sense. They sedated her.

107
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,274
Who's her doctor?

108
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,352
Some psychiatrist at the med center.

109
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,193
That's actually why I came to see you.

110
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,190
When you were in Belle Reve...

111
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,830
...the doctors helped you
when you were having problems, right?

112
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,596
I'll make the call.

113
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,149
She'll have the best doctors this side
of Vienna helping within the hour.

114
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,198
Lex, thank you.
I didn't know who else to go to.

115
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,399
Lex, what are you doing here?

116
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,231
Lana came to see me.

117
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,595
She told me what happened.

118
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,909
Thanks for coming by,
but we have it under control.

119
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,869
Clark, this is a local med center.

120
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,315
If Chloe scraped her knee,
she'd be in good hands.

121
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,472
But something like this requires
a more delicate touch.

122
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,396
I'll make sure she gets
the best care possible.

123
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,513
You're gonna transfer her?

124
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,991
The helicopter is en route.

125
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,674
She'll be in Belle Reve
before she wakes up.

126
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,831
Chloe doesn't belong in Belle Reve.

127
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,956
Lana thinks so.

128
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,078
I know how much
you care about Chloe.

129
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,074
A close friend, someone you trust
more than anyone else in the world...

130
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,629
<i>...it's</i> hard to see them like this.

131
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,838
I'll take good care of her.

132
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,797
I promise.

133
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,275
What are you doing?
She should be in the hospital.

134
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,193
Lex wanted to transfer her
to Belle Reve.

135
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,832
Well, clark, maybe that's
what she needs right now.

136
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,991
Lois, you don't know
what goes on in there.

137
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,833
You want Lex and his doctors
getting inside chloe's head?

138
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,629
If it makes her better, I don't care
if Daffy Duck whacks her with a mallet.

139
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,588
You guys, I'm drugged, I'm not deaf.

140
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,955
Hey. How you feeling?

141
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,994
- Thirsty.
- I'll get you some water.

142
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,915
Actually, can I just get a cappuccino?
I think it might help clear the cobwebs.

143
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,319
I'll go downstairs
and whip you up a double.

144
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,078
Can you not do anything ridiculous
for five minutes?

145
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,868
- Not too happy about the breakout, huh?
- Yeah.

146
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,918
She's just worried about you.
We all are.

147
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,951
Clark, I know what I saw.

148
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,270
I didn't imagine anything.

149
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,990
And I didn't hurt myself,
I wouldn't do that.

150
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,037
I'm not my mother.

151
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,916
I know.

152
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,275
<i>I have to find him.</i>

153
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,115
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

154
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,592
Help me.

155
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,517
<i>- I have to find him.</i>
- She's here.

156
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,916
Chloe, you okay?

157
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,514
- She's in the wall.
- Who?

158
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,478
The girl I keep seeing.
We have to help her.

159
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,871
Chloe, look, just calm down, all right?
We'll get her out of the wall.

160
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,996
No, Clark. No, Clark!
Clark, I'm not crazy.

161
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,715
She's in the wall. Please, just look.

162
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,958
Please.

163
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,798
Oh, my God.

164
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,868
What...?

165
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,158
Clark. Clark.

166
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,756
Yes, it was in the bathroom wall.

167
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,036
No, I don't know
how long it's been there.

168
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,713
No, this is not a prank.

169
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,235
Would you just send the sheriff over?

170
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,072
The sheriff?

171
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,037
Clark, what did you do now?

172
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,919
- Lois.
- I can't believe this. What...?

173
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,598
Holy crap.

174
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,232
What...?

175
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,797
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

176
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,753
I feel much better now.

177
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,554
Maybe what you saw
wasn't in your head.

178
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,188
Maybe this girl's spirit was
trying to contact you.

179
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,432
When lightening hit the Talon
it must have jumped-started her body.

180
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,716
Not to mention
the kryptonite in her bracelet.

181
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,597
Yeah, the krypto-thing.

182
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,669
That poor girl, sealed up in that wall
all that time, all alone.

183
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,349
- I just hope she didn't suffer.
- Well, I think she did.

184
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,393
A lot.

185
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,592
That's good.

186
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,198
- You should get some rest.
- No, I've slept enough.

187
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,918
We need to find him.

188
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,239
Find who?

189
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,234
The man who did this.
He needs to suffer like she did.

190
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,873
Why don't you try to go to sleep?

191
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,917
We'll talk about this in the morning.

192
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,472
Her name was Gretchen Winters.

193
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,518
The police don't have any leads
on who put her behind the wall?

194
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,036
The new sheriff's a little green.
But Gretchen is not the only girl...

195
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,475
...they found on the wrong side
of some drywall.

196
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,877
Chloe should hear this.

197
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,239
Chloe.

198
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,838
Where'd she go?

199
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,798
Chloe.

200
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,837
Hey, roomie.

201
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,470
Where have you been? Lex and I
have been looking for you all night.

202
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,198
I just...

203
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,750
I had some stuff that I had to get to.
Can I borrow this?

204
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,399
That's yours.

205
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,072
I've got some pretty cool stuff.

206
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,274
- See you around.
- Chloe, wait. Where are you going?

207
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,472
Sorry.

208
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,437
- Where do you think you're going?
- Why does everyone keep asking that?

209
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,273
- Because we're worried about you.
- Don't be, I'm fine.

210
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,149
I know you may think you're better,
but it's just a trick your mind's playing.

211
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,197
- You need help.
- No.

212
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,430
What I need is for you
to move out of my way.

213
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,388
I'm sorry,
but I'm taking you to Belle Reve.

214
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,272
What happened?

215
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,636
You tell me. How did Chloe
get out of her restraints at the hospital?

216
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,038
Chloe was here? Where'd she go?

217
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,516
I don't know,
but she was a different person.

218
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,956
Now she's out there with a weapon
when she should be getting help.

219
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,473
Nice work.

220
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,709
I told you she should have
stayed at the hospital.

221
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,757
<i>I'll see if Chloe's been to the</i> Planet.

222
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,913
Okay, fine. Fine.
I'll call you if she shows up, all right?

223
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,998
Sorry. I was just about to knock.

224
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,515
- Do I know you?
- Yeah.

225
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,150
We did a pass-by at the hospital
when they brought your cousin. Michael.

226
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,393
Right, the nurse.

227
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,833
Orderly, actually.
Nurse is a whole other thing.

228
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,232
Excuse me. I'm just trying to do
a little aura cleansing.

229
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,117
- Have you seen Chloe?
- No, I haven't.

230
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,155
I didn't know that orderlies
made house calls.

231
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,311
She just seemed
like a really sweet girl.

232
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,792
I wanna make sure she gets help
before something bad happens.

233
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,559
Well, I'll call Dr. Sydell
if I hear from her.

234
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,471
What are you looking at?

235
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,637
Oh, nothing.

236
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,032
My dad used to run this place,
back when it was a movie theater.

237
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,159
I haven't been up here in, God,
must be going on 10 years now.

238
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,038
Ten years.

239
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,833
Looks a lot nicer. Smells better too.

240
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,269
Miracle of the aura-cleansing sage.

241
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,319
Speaking of which,
I should probably get back to my thing.

242
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,391
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

243
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,837
If you see her, will you tell her
I was asking about her?

244
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,116
- Sure.
- Good. Thanks.

245
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,952
No problem.

246
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,434
Come on. Come on.

247
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,318
No, don't. Don't, don't.
Don't fight. It's okay.

248
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,994
<i>Smallville sheriff station.</i>

249
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,798
<i>Hello?</i>

250
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,399
<i>Hello.</i>

251
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,630
- Michael.
- Miss Sullivan.

252
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,515
I'm sorry,
I didn't know where else to go.

253
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,954
I need your help.

254
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,832
Of course I'll help you.
Please, come in.

255
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,872
I know things probably seem
pretty bad right now...

256
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,951
<i>...but</i> it's gonna be all right.

257
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,519
I'll help you.

258
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,351
Like you did with Gretchen?

259
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,672
- Who?
- Gretchen Winters.

260
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,274
You remember her, don't you?

261
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,273
You were so nice to her at first.

262
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,194
You gave her a pretty green bracelet
and you held her when she cried...

263
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,316
...and you listened
to all her problems...

264
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,313
...all the things
that were tearing her up inside.

265
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,474
And then you told her your problems...

266
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,156
...and it made her sick!

267
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,674
And she tried to leave,
but you wouldn't let her go!

268
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,638
- And you grabbed a knife...
- How could you know that?

269
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,319
No one can.

270
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,429
Except you and Gretchen.

271
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,160
She didn't deserve to die like that,
you son of a bitch!

272
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,111
You're very ill, Miss Sullivan.
That's why you're talking like this.

273
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,510
But don't worry, I can help.

274
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,597
This is gonna hurt just a little bit.

275
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,037
This is gonna hurt a lot.

276
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,998
Help!

277
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,673
Help me!

278
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,637
Is somebody up there?

279
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,793
Chloe. We have to get out of here.

280
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,190
The orderly from the hospital
killed that girl.

281
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,958
I know. It's okay.

282
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,236
He's not gonna hurt anyone again.

283
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,713
Chloe!

284
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,551
Time for your treatment, ladies.

285
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,678
Does it hurt?

286
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,080
Feel like you wanna
do something wrong to yourself...

287
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,117
...even though you deserve it?

288
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,198
Let them go.

289
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,233
"Them"?

290
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,638
Disassociated.

291
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,876
Removed from what's happening.

292
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,914
You really are sick.

293
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,479
Look who's talking.

294
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,674
There are things that squirm
just beneath the skin.

295
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,793
But I can make them stop.

296
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,829
Hey! Get the hell away from her!

297
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,599
I'm just trying to help
before she ends up in an asylum...

298
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,949
...like her mother.

299
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,038
Her mother?

300
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,755
It was one of her squirmy things.

301
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,670
She didn't even tell her doctor.

302
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,869
But I get inside my girls.

303
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,830
I find out things.

304
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,755
My father used to make these.

305
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,470
He was very good with his hands.

306
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,189
I'd just sit for hours and watch him.

307
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,194
While I watched,
he would tell me secrets...

308
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,918
...about my mother.

309
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,156
She wasn't very nice.

310
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,359
But he loved her.

311
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,399
He helped her be at peace.

312
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,437
I help my girls.

313
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,794
I take their secrets...

314
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,911
...and they take mine.

315
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,234
Forever.

316
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,515
You always hurt the ones you love.

317
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,911
It's not a secret.

318
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,190
It's just something you have to learn.

319
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,634
No, wait! Wait!

320
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,597
- Wait, I'm sorry!
- So am I, sometimes.

321
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,194
But we do what we have to
to get better.

322
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,678
No! No!

323
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,273
Take it.

324
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,473
Take it!

325
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,554
Slit your wrist.

326
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,273
Screw you, shorty.

327
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,438
Open your wrist
and release all your secrets.

328
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,353
You can be at peace,
just like all of them.

329
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,552
Or...

330
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,796
...you'll watch your cousin die.

331
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,792
Do it!

332
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,479
Do it.

333
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,837
Or her pretty face
won't be so pretty anymore.

334
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,356
Are all the women in
your family crazy?

335
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,471
No! No!

336
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,635
No, Mikey! Mikey! Mikey! Mikey.

337
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,068
Mikey.

338
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,439
What did you call me?

339
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,312
Mikey. That's what your dad
used to call you, "little Mikey."

340
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,948
Remember that? You hated it.

341
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,394
How do you know so much?

342
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,955
I know all your secrets, Mikey.

343
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,078
It's me.

344
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,231
It's Gretchen.

345
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,518
Gretchen.

346
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,271
I need you, Mikey.

347
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,038
Please? I need you
to take away all my secrets.

348
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,438
Make it stop hurting,
just like you did before. Please?

349
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,676
Anything for my girl.

350
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,071
Anything for my girl.

351
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,151
No. What...? What are you doing?

352
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,871
Gretchen, stop it.

353
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,119
Chloe.

354
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,828
- You okay?
- Yeah.

355
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,513
What happened?

356
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,313
I guess Gretchen got
what she came back for.

357
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,479
Hey.

358
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,273
Hey.

359
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,117
Chloe told me what happened.

360
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,469
- Yeah, how's she holding up?
- She's <i>okay...</i>

361
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,355
...considering that
she was possessed...

362
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,796
...and almost chopped up
by a psychotic orderly.

363
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,277
Why didn't you tell me
you went to Lex?

364
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,838
Why didn't you tell me you
broke Chloe out of the psych ward?

365
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,429
We should have
come together, Clark.

366
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,398
That's what couples do
when these things happen.

367
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,993
They turn to each other.

368
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,514
Why didn't we?

369
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,197
I love you.

370
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,914
I love you with all of my heart.

371
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,479
But...

372
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,190
<i>...I</i> don't know
how to talk to you anymore.

373
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,508
I guess we all have our secrets.

374
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,878
- How's the tractor coming?
- I think I got it working.

375
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,510
- I'm not as handy with tools as Dad was.
- I'm sure it's fine.

376
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,391
There's an awful lot
of your father in you.

377
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,759
I hope so.

378
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,158
You really understand all that stuff?

379
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,159
Most of it.

380
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,154
Your mother was a corporate animal
once, as hard as that is to believe.

381
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,039
It's not.

382
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,392
I always thought you could do whatever
you wanted to if you put your mind to it.

383
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,152
So did Dad.

384
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,751
You should do it, Mom.

385
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,913
You should take over Dad's
state Senate seat.

386
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,031
I can't do that.

387
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,033
Why not?

388
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,954
Being a state senator
isn't a part-time job.

389
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,112
I'd be gone all the time.
We have a farm to run.

390
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,872
Mom, I can take over the farm.

391
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,319
I think this is something
you really want to do.

392
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,436
And I know it's what Dad
would have wanted.

393
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,119
Well...

394
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,871
...I never was one
to disappoint a Kent boy.

395
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,678
"Smallville serial killer commits suicide.
By Ted Biddleman."

396
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,400
I can't even get a byline
when I'm a part of the story.

397
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,313
- I'm just glad you're not in the obituaries.
- Yeah.

398
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,789
Or wearing a straitjacket
at Belle Reve.

399
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,871
I'd never let that happen.

400
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,560
You know,
I had a couple of moments there...

401
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,632
...where I actually thought
I was losing my mind.

402
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,317
I mean, I understand how Gretchen's
spirit was released and all that...

403
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,677
...but why was I
the only one that could see her?

404
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,876
I mean, why did she choose me?

405
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,355
Maybe because you care more about
other people than anyone else I know.

406
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,352
Or maybe there really is
something wrong with me...

407
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,078
...like my mother.

408
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,839
What is wrong
with your mother, exactly?

409
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,238
I don't know.

410
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,678
I mean...

411
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,515
...she left when I was 12,
so that was before...

412
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,399
I don't know.

413
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,593
But you do know where she is?

414
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,839
Yeah.

415
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,351
Why haven't you gone to see her?

416
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,955
Well, because...

417
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,551
Because I'm afraid.

418
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,436
I mean, what if I look into her eyes
and I see myself?

419
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,468
What if you wait too long and never get
the chance to look into her eyes again?

420
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,752
She's your mother.

421
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,112
She always will be. It's not
going to change, no matter what.

422
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,514
Mom.

423
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,391
