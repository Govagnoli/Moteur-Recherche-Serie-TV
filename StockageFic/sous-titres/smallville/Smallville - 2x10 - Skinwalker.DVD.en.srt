1
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,644
- Good night, boys.
- Okay, good night.

2
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:15,172
- Good job.
- Thanks. See you tomorrow.

3
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:18,212
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

4
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,766
Old man, I've told you before,
you're trespassing.

5
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:41,600
How can I be trespassing on land
my people owned for thousands of years?

6
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,744
Out of my way, chief.
I've got a job to get done.

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,071
You don't understand the consequences
of what you're doing.

8
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,978
Are you threatening me?

9
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,317
How can I be threatening you?
I'm just an old man.

10
00:00:56,089 --> 00:01:00,219
You got a problem,
take it up with the big guy.

11
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,458
Get the hell out of here.

12
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,034
What are the police doing here?

13
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:39,337
There was some sort of an accident
last night, an explosion.

14
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,504
Maybe this will convince LuthorCorp
to get out of Smallville.

15
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:46,618
It's an office park, Pete, not a toxic waste
dump. What's the harm in that?

16
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,447
I'll race you back to Miller's Bend.

17
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,387
Hey, kids, watch yourselves!

18
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,639
Lana?

19
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,207
Don't move.

20
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,904
- I'm fine.
- You're in shock. You fell over 100 feet.

21
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,416
- You don't have a scratch on you.
- Just lucky, I guess.

22
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,352
- That's incredible luck you have.
- Where did you come from?

23
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,357
I was just over there doing research
for my grandfather.

24
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,523
The landslide must have
opened up that wall.

25
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,063
I didn't even know
there were caves down here.

26
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,293
If LuthorCorp has its way
then there won't be anymore.

27
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,131
I'm Kyla, by the way.

28
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,444
Clark.

29
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,671
Clark Kent.

30
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:25,577
- The invincible Clark Kent, apparently.
- Clark!

31
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,611
You down there?

32
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,153
Yeah, Pete, I'm all right.

33
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,952
Hey, man, you gonna need some help,
or can you jump your way out?

34
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,721
I've got some company down here.
He's a funny guy.

35
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,559
As long as you're all right.

36
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,530
Oh, my God.

37
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:44,764
What is it?

38
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,767
It's the legend of Naman.

39
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:53,510
My ancestors have passed down
this story for generations.

40
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:57,308
They said it had been written
in the earth long ago...

41
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,975
...but nobody ever knew where it was
until now.

42
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,089
Thank you.

43
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,083
Sure. No problem.

44
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,421
You don't understand.

45
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:13,258
My grandfather's been searching
for this wall his whole life.

46
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,699
It was prophesied that Naman would fall
from the skies in a rain of fire.

47
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,134
They say Naman will have the strength
of 10 men...

48
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,366
...and will be able to start fires
with his eyes.

49
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,874
It probably sounds silly.

50
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,178
Not to me.

51
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,715
I've gotta tell my grandfather
about this.

52
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,180
Come on, I'll show you the way out.

53
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,410
Try and keep up.

54
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,669
- It's an octagon. It's a very common shape.
- What about the story?

55
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:06,012
How many people fall to Earth in a meteor
shower and can shoot fire from their eyes?

56
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,387
I understand it's important for you
to figure out where you came from...

57
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:14,287
...but those drawings could have
a hundred different interpretations.

58
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,094
You pulled this from the spaceship
before it closed.

59
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,891
- I don't see what...
- These same symbols are in the caves.

60
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,463
Kyla's grandfather has studied
the story of Naman.

61
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,865
Maybe he can read this.

62
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,640
I want you to be careful
what you tell those people, Clark.

63
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,870
If they can tell me who or what I am,
it's worth the risk.

64
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:35,377
We don't know anything about Kyla.
Or her grandfather, for that matter.

65
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:40,174
I know. That's why
I invited them over for dinner.

66
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,579
According to the legend,
a man came from the stars...

67
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:47,089
...and fell in love with the mother
of our people.

68
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,759
Out of that forbidden affair,
the Kawatche people were born.

69
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,958
- Do you know which star he came from?
- The legend only tells us...

70
00:08:56,135 --> 00:09:01,038
...that he left one day and flew back into
the sky, promising he would send another.

71
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,335
That would be this Naman person
you've been talking about, right?

72
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,308
Yes. Of course,
that was 500 years ago.

73
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,414
He's a little late.

74
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,382
You're not from around here,
are you, Clark?

75
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,017
Actually, Clark is adopted.

76
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,525
These symbols seem to make up
some sort of alphabet.

77
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,166
That's the really weird part.

78
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,134
Our people don't have a written language.

79
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:36,708
I've seen a symbol here or there on
artifacts, but never in a pattern before.

80
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,337
- So you don't know what they mean?
- He studied ancient languages.

81
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,175
I'm sure with some time
he can decipher the symbols.

82
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,681
If Luthor doesn't get at them
before we do.

83
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,583
Mom, maybe you can talk to Mr. Luthor.

84
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:56,828
- You know Lionel Luthor?
- Know him? Mom is his executive assistant.

85
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,988
Well, Clark, I'll do what I can,
but it isn't that easy.

86
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,657
The situation isn't that black-and-white.

87
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:06,566
That complex will create 1000
desperately needed jobs.

88
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,801
And you think that's more important
than these caves?

89
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,941
So does anyone want coffee
with their pie?

90
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,119
You wanna have a look?

91
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,626
I kind of like seeing them
with my own eyes.

92
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:44,509
So these legends, you don't think
that they're like Venus and Apollo...

93
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,838
...and all the other myths?

94
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,339
Just because something's a myth
doesn't make it not true.

95
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,414
Here.

96
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,752
Do you see the bright one right there?

97
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:03,290
If you follow the stars around it,
it makes the shape of a wolf's head.

98
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,025
See how one of the eyes is missing?

99
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,500
Our ancestors say that there
used to be a star there...

100
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,728
...and that's where Naman came from.

101
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,840
I wonder what happened to it.

102
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,903
You tell me.

103
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,472
You're the one that fell from the sky.

104
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,682
Lana.

105
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,226
Your message sounded urgent,
so I just came over.

106
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,125
I didn't realize you had company.

107
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,262
Oh, thanks. Lana, this is Kyla.

108
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,234
Hi. I don't think I've seen you
at school before.

109
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:49,067
Oh, I go to Grandville. I'm just here
doing research for my grandfather...

110
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:52,870
...and rescuing any guys
that happen to fall into my life.

111
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,474
How did you two meet?

112
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,276
In these caves
under the new LuthorCorp site.

113
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,850
That's why I called you.

114
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,079
If this new complex goes ahead,
the caves will be destroyed...

115
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,382
...along with paintings
Kyla's ancestors drew.

116
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,458
They're our only link to the past.

117
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,993
Defending a good cause sounds like
something Henry Small might be into.

118
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:14,064
We're not exactly at the
father-daughter favor stage yet.

119
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,966
But I'll ask him anyway.

120
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,937
Thank you, Lana.

121
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,774
No problem.

122
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,248
So it's not the first time
he's been involved.

123
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,386
Thank you, sheriff. I'm glad you told me.
It's very enlightening.

124
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,954
- We'll keep you posted, Mr. Luthor.
- Thank you.

125
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,020
I thought the police were done
with their investigation.

126
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,525
The sheriff's not ready
to call it an accident.

127
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,459
Apparently Joseph Willowbrook...

128
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,361
...the Native American
who's spearheading the protests...

129
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,729
...has a history of civil disobedience.

130
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:55,567
- They think it was sabotage?
- Let's just say they're not ruling it out.

131
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:59,968
Maybe I should have done this project
in Grandville.

132
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,910
Smallville needs those jobs.

133
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,779
I sent flowers to the foreman's family...

134
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,514
...and I arranged for you to do
a condolence call tomorrow afternoon.

135
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,457
Good thinking. I don't want
to be perceived as uncaring.

136
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,927
I didn't do it for that reason.
It's the right thing to do.

137
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:26,097
There are times when I'm with you
that I'd swear I was talking to my wife.

138
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:30,739
She was a lot like you, Martha.
The same unflinching honesty.

139
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,510
I miss that.

140
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,146
- Hope I'm not interrupting.
- Hi, Lex.

141
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:39,148
Lex. Always good to hear your voice, son.

142
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:43,448
Well, I need to get home early today,
so I'll see you tomorrow.

143
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,292
Believe me, Lex, I know how hard
you've been working.

144
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,124
You engineered an employee buyout
of the Smallville plant.

145
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,028
Now...

146
00:13:55,367 --> 00:14:00,566
...Iook at you, you're building an empire
of your own without my help.

147
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,970
But your success shouldn't prevent us
from joining forces...

148
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:07,340
...when a lucrative venture comes along.

149
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,779
Come on, Dad. You don't need me as
an investor in some random office park.

150
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:16,115
No, not as an investor, Lex.
I want you as my partner.

151
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,780
Blame it on a brief bout
of sentimentality.

152
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,626
Sentimentality is synonymous
with vulnerability.

153
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:27,630
You taught me that.
You're on your own.

154
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,734
The pictographs are
a lot more detailed up here.

155
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,073
What do they say?

156
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:47,911
It promises that one day,
Naman will protect the entire world.

157
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:54,388
Luthor's bulldozers.
It's been happening all week.

158
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,028
I don't know if it's safe for us
to be here right now.

159
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,289
Clark, get up here,
you have to see this.

160
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,236
What is it?

161
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,397
It's Sageeth.
He's like a brother to Naman.

162
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,975
Legend has it one day
he'll turn against Naman...

163
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:16,205
...and together they'll be the balance
between good and evil.

164
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,583
Who's that?

165
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,584
It's the woman he's destined to be with.

166
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,133
It was handed down
through the women in my family.

167
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,267
I don't even know how old it is.

168
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,427
- How'd you do that?
- Adrenaline, I guess.

169
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:16,096
Yesterday you didn't have
a scratch on you and...

170
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,802
What, you can shoot fire
out your eyes too?

171
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,240
Oh, my God.

172
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,680
I was just joking.

173
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,810
You...

174
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,287
- You really are Naman.
- I don't know what I am.

175
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,557
You don't seem very freaked out.

176
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,197
Because I know what it's like
to be different.

177
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,605
Clark, it's okay.

178
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:52,643
Maybe this could explain everything
I've been feeling in the last few days.

179
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,143
There are a lot of things about me
I can't explain.

180
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,305
Clark, you don't have to.

181
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,475
I grew up around a lot of things
that seemed unexplainable.

182
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:01,983
Yeah, but I'm...

183
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:07,785
You try and use logic and reason
to try and make sense of it...

184
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,360
...but you just have to give in.

185
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,811
Thanks for your help, Mr. Small.
It's really great of you to do this.

186
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,506
To be honest, I'm glad you called.

187
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,981
There's something
I wanna talk to you about.

188
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,786
Lana, I got the test results back.

189
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,459
Looks like we share the same DNA.

190
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,269
So you really are...

191
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,805
You're my father.

192
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:02,670
I don't think I've earned that place
in your life yet.

193
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,341
But I want to.

194
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,518
If it's not too late.

195
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:30,097
Mrs. Kent, if you're looking for Clark, he
and Kyla are down documenting the caves.

196
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,073
Actually, I'm here
on a more official capacity.

197
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,874
Mr. Luthor would like to sit down with you
and discuss your concerns.

198
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:42,077
I'm usually better at spotting the wolf
in sheep's clothing.

199
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,486
Mr. Willowbrook...

200
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:48,023
...I understand the importance
of these caves better than anyone...

201
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,788
...but there must be a way for you
and LuthorCorp to coexist peacefully.

202
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,091
You'll have to forgive my skepticism...

203
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:58,032
...but every time Native Americans
are asked to peacefully coexist...

204
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,070
...we've been killed
or forced onto reservations.

205
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,641
- Please, Mr. Willowbrook...
- You may get your day in court yet, Joseph.

206
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:06,938
Based on discoveries in the caves...

207
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,138
...this cease and desist order
is effective immediately.

208
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,215
A hearing is set for a week from today.

209
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,876
Tell your boss if he wants to talk,
I'll see him in court.

210
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:20,583
Sheriff, if you're here to harass me
about my permit to protest...

211
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,126
Joseph, I'm placing you under arrest
for the murder of Dan Hammond...

212
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:27,493
...the foreman of this construction site.
- There has to be a mistake.

213
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,864
We found a towel in Mr. Willowbrook's
trash with blood that matched the victim's.

214
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:35,871
Is this LuthorCorp's idea
of peaceful coexistence?

215
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,338
- Framing an innocent man?
- Come with me, sir.

216
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,079
Lex.

217
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,814
I'm gonna have to call you back.

218
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,952
Clark. Is everything all right?

219
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,657
I need to raise bail money for Joseph
Willowbrook. He's being set up.

220
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,798
I think by LuthorCorp.

221
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,169
That's a pretty serious accusation, Clark.

222
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,862
Don't get me wrong,
I'm impressed by your conviction...

223
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,364
...but going head-to-head
with my father?

224
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,136
You're a little like David
trying to slay Goliath.

225
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:14,673
Where do you stand?

226
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:20,281
Any culture that's left a legacy to endure
for centuries has earned my respect.

227
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,543
I'm afraid it's a losing battle.

228
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,245
Didn't David beat Goliath?

229
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,421
Your newfound advocacy
wouldn't have anything to do...

230
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,461
...with a beautiful, doe-eyed
crusader, would it?

231
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:36,194
Your mother told me about Kyla.

232
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,332
You ever wondered if you were destined
to be with someone?

233
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:43,565
You're asking someone who's been fighting
his destiny his entire life.

234
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:49,844
I'm a little surprised to see
you've moved on so quickly.

235
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,409
What happened to Lana?

236
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,615
It's a completely different feeling
when the person likes you back.

237
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,924
Lex, please, can you help me
with the bail money?

238
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:08,726
I'm sorry, Clark, but I don't make it
a practice to bail out alleged murderers.

239
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,264
Maybe I can get you
to change your mind.

240
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,773
Thank you.

241
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,240
Hey. So it looks like Clark pulled you
into his activist phase.

242
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,578
Between him and Henry,
I didn't have a choice.

243
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,017
They are fighting
for something really important.

244
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,416
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

245
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,888
I've never seen Clark this passionate
about a cause.

246
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,994
I don't think the cause is the only thing
he's passionate about.

247
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:41,997
Yeah, so, what is it about Kyla
that breaks through Clark's shining armor?

248
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,635
I always thought Clark
had trouble letting people in.

249
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,169
I guess he was just waiting
for the right one.

250
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,797
You know, Clark's sudden interest in Kyla
wouldn't have anything...

251
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,603
- Hello.
- Thanks.

252
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:56,509
Wouldn't have anything to do with the
letter that you wrote Whitney, would it?

253
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,809
I saw it on the counter this morning.

254
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,418
It's one of the pitfalls
of having a roommate.

255
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,982
Whitney and I have been writing
to each other every week since he left.

256
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:10,387
Actually, I've been writing him.
He hasn't really responded much lately.

257
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:14,330
Am I being really evil if I suggest
that maybe he's trying to move on?

258
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,864
I don't know.

259
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:19,731
Whitney's shared more with me since
we broke up than when we were together.

260
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:23,932
What is with guys and emotions? The closer
you get, the more they keep everything in.

261
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,805
Must be some sort
of a protective instinct.

262
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,879
Maybe we should just stop falling for guys
who are trying to save the world.

263
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,948
Not that I don't find the stench
of a cave invigorating...

264
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,215
...but what does this have to do
with Joseph?

265
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:43,327
I wanted you to see them for themselves.
This is what he wants to protect.

266
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,061
Incredible.

267
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:49,029
These may be more impressive
than the caves at Lascaux.

268
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,034
Joseph and Kyla are trying to get a team
to authenticate them.

269
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,662
So you're doing all of this
for some cave paintings?

270
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,738
I'm doing it because I think it's important
for people to understand their past.

271
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:03,347
- Don't you?
- Looks like a fascinating story.

272
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,813
Makes you wonder if the people
who drew these...

273
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,646
...thought we'd be here
100 years later looking at them.

274
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,053
Somehow I think they did.

275
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,852
Lex, these caves are part of our history.

276
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:18,894
Saving these paintings might be
the most important thing you'll ever do.

277
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,424
What do you think, Lex?

278
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,967
Maybe more important
than anything we can imagine.

279
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,507
I can't believe you got Grandpa out
so quickly.

280
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,345
Thank you, Clark.

281
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,914
I don't know how I feel
about the fact...

282
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,212
...that it was Luthor money
that bailed me out.

283
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:45,550
- Not all Luthors are the same.
- Why are you doing all this?

284
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:50,854
It's for a good cause.

285
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,665
Mom? Thought you'd be at work.

286
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,963
I was running an errand
and I wanted to come by.

287
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:04,666
Mr. Willowbrook, I'm sorry you got
tangled up in the murder investigation.

288
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:10,145
People don't get tangled up in things
like this, Mrs. Kent, they get set up.

289
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:14,512
I don't think more false accusations
are going to help anyone's situation.

290
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,849
Mom, someone from LuthorCorp
put the bloody towel in Joseph's trash.

291
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:20,355
You may have come here
with good intentions...

292
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,993
...but it's clear
where your allegiances lie.

293
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,629
Kyla, I think we need to go.

294
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,674
Thank you.

295
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,141
Anything new in Joseph's case?

296
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,409
You know, Clark, a simple "Hello, Chloe"
goes a long way.

297
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:50,282
- I know. I'm sorry, I'm just a little...
- Obsessed? I've noticed.

298
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:52,787
I just got off the phone
with the coroner's office.

299
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,756
They finished the autopsy
and there's a new development.

300
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:58,691
I guess they found teeth marks
in the foreman's bones.

301
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,856
- What kind of teeth marks?
- Canis lupus.

302
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,557
Wolf.

303
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,293
Takes Joseph off the hook.

304
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,529
Still a few notches this side of normal.

305
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:11,267
I mean, wolves have been extinct
in Smallville for 90 years.

306
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:15,106
The look on your face tells me
you have a Wall of Weird explanation.

307
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,337
Don't kill the messenger...

308
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:22,010
...but I found out that Kyla's tribe name
translates into "skinwalkers."

309
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,550
What is this, some sort of tribal ritual?

310
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:30,923
It's a Native American myth
where the humans transform into animals.

311
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:34,759
- It's just a legend.
- Clark, sometimes legends are true.

312
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:38,198
It's not the first time Joseph's
been arrested for his radical tactics.

313
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,895
Joseph's not a murderer.

314
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:08,355
Well, what do you know?
You do still live here.

315
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,495
Oh, Kyla called for you.

316
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,426
Twice.

317
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:16,795
You two certainly seem
to be getting pretty serious.

318
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,403
Yeah, I can be myself with her.

319
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,734
For the first time in my life
I feel like everything fits.

320
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,171
Like we're destined to be together.

321
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,346
But still there's something wrong.

322
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,647
Why don't you have a seat, son.

323
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,651
What's up?

324
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,725
I have these feelings for Kyla.

325
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:46,363
I don't wanna doubt her...

326
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,694
...but I'm not sure
she's being honest with me.

327
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,926
Well, Clark, not everybody's
exactly what they seem.

328
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,800
I mean, we should know that
better than anybody.

329
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:01,276
I think she knows more about
the foreman's death than she's telling me.

330
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,710
Mom?

331
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,515
Mom, what's wrong?

332
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,679
A wolf tried to attack me.

333
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,657
Lex.

334
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,896
Have I done something
in the recent past to offend you?

335
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,665
There are so many ways
I could answer that question, Dad.

336
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,274
I am referring to the fact
that you posted bail...

337
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:35,277
...for a man who allegedly murdered
my foreman.

338
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:38,416
Don't tell me you're afraid
of an old man.

339
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:44,321
I'm sure you know that this project
has become a public relations disaster...

340
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:47,151
...but now you have added
an entirely new angle...

341
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:51,694
...for those damn tree-huggers
to exploit.

342
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:56,266
You're right about the PR nightmare,
but perhaps we can give it a positive spin.

343
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:02,402
Is that your cryptic way of saying
you've reconsidered my proposition, Lex?

344
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,407
- No.
- No.

345
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,980
I'm offering to take this project
off your hands.

346
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,651
I'll match dollar for dollar
what you've sunk into the complex.

347
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:15,376
Buy me out?

348
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:19,045
What advantage would you get
out of such an impulsive act?

349
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:23,661
The satisfaction of seeing
a local treasure preserved forever.

350
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:28,458
No, I know you too well to believe
you've become an activist, Lex.

351
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:34,268
There's something about that land
that is extremely valuable.

352
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,771
And you know what it is.

353
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:57,894
Hi.

354
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:02,256
- Thought I was supposed to meet you later.
- I needed to talk to you.

355
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,598
Is everything okay?

356
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,866
Kyla, I've been more open with you
than almost anyone ever.

357
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,306
It's okay, Clark.
I'm not gonna tell anyone your secret.

358
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:18,074
I know. I trust you. That's what
makes this so much more weird.

359
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,286
What do you know about skinwalkers?

360
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,489
Have you been studying up for me?

361
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,598
The stories say that people can turn
into animals. Are they true?

362
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,396
The visitor from the stars supposedly
brought special green stones.

363
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,064
They had really strange effects
on the people.

364
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,802
That's when they said
the first skinwalkers appeared.

365
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,536
So they're real.

366
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,738
It's like you said,
they're just stories.

367
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,575
Like the legend of Naman
is just a story?

368
00:30:56,988 --> 00:31:00,219
I know how important your grandfather
is to you, but I need to know...

369
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,484
...is it possible he's a skinwalker?

370
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,924
I can't believe you're doing this.

371
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:08,429
My mom was attacked by a wolf after
an argument with your grandfather...

372
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,761
...and the foreman was mauled
by a wolf.

373
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:14,496
- You can't think he's a murderer!
- He'd do anything to save the caves.

374
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:15,969
I thought you were on our side.

375
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,870
The paintings are important,
but not enough to kill people.

376
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:22,240
If this is how you think of us, maybe
we weren't meant to be together.

377
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,479
My grandfather's right.

378
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:27,311
Lionel Luthor controls you all.

379
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:54,236
Lex?

380
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,338
Who's there?

381
00:33:44,388 --> 00:33:46,015
Joseph!

382
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,368
- Don't move!
- No, no, don't shoot!

383
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:01,635
Joseph...

384
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,711
Joseph!

385
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:18,750
Joseph.

386
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:38,370
Kyla?

387
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:40,100
No.

388
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:41,767
No!

389
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:43,974
Kyla?

390
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:47,777
Oh, are you okay?
Come here. You're okay.

391
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:49,578
Come here.

392
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,988
You all right?

393
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,191
I didn't wanna hurt the foreman
or your mother, Clark.

394
00:34:57,327 --> 00:34:59,818
Why didn't you tell me it was you?

395
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,225
I didn't want to lie...

396
00:35:01,398 --> 00:35:04,765
...but I saw the look in your eye
when you thought it was my grandfather.

397
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:06,459
I'm sorry, Kyla.

398
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:11,875
You're the first person
I thought I could trust.

399
00:35:12,042 --> 00:35:16,103
I knew that you knew what it felt like
to carry such a big secret.

400
00:35:18,048 --> 00:35:21,575
- I have to get you to the hospital.
- Clark, stay with me.

401
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,714
I'm sorry.

402
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:32,694
I'm sorry I can't be the one
for you, Naman.

403
00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:37,332
No.

404
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:21,005
- Mr. Luthor, we're all shut down here, sir.
- What's the problem?

405
00:36:21,645 --> 00:36:23,704
Some kid thinks he's a hero.

406
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,781
Clark?

407
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:28,583
I'm indebted to your son
for his courage yesterday...

408
00:36:28,752 --> 00:36:30,845
...but I thought you talked
to him about this.

409
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:33,683
I did, and I agree with him.

410
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:37,156
Are you willing
to lose your job over this?

411
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,722
That's up to you.

412
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:42,661
Martha?

413
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,562
Martha?

414
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:06,784
Thank you, Clark.

415
00:37:06,957 --> 00:37:09,391
Kyla was right to believe in you.

416
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,354
I didn't save her.

417
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,129
You did what you could.

418
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,033
Know this:

419
00:37:19,202 --> 00:37:23,036
Kyla had faith in you and so do I.

420
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,235
Whatever your destiny...

421
00:37:28,845 --> 00:37:31,211
...for the true one in your life.

422
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:54,225
Dad, you always told me
to choose my battles wisely.

423
00:37:54,404 --> 00:37:57,567
I hope I didn't use
such an obvious cliche.

424
00:37:57,741 --> 00:38:00,574
You should have taken my offer
on this land.

425
00:38:00,744 --> 00:38:03,042
- What's this?
- In light of the petition drive...

426
00:38:03,213 --> 00:38:06,808
...the state has decided to exercise
the Historic Artifacts Amendment...

427
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:09,282
...and buy you out
at 30 cents on the dollar.

428
00:38:09,653 --> 00:38:12,520
You'll be happy to hear
LexCorp has secured the contract...

429
00:38:12,689 --> 00:38:14,919
...for the preservation of this entire area.

430
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:20,086
Altruism is not in your blood, Lex,
believe me.

431
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:25,795
I don't know what you're up to, but you
found something valuable in those caves...

432
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:29,063
...and whatever it is, I'll find it.

433
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,027
Lana.

434
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:33,436
I wanted to tell you
how sorry I am about Kyla.

435
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:39,373
I'm sorry you didn't get a chance
to know her better.

436
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,910
You had a lot in common.

437
00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:47,550
That means a lot, knowing
how important she was to you.

438
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:55,457
Kyla told me there used to be a star...

439
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:58,321
...right out there with the bright one.

440
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,259
But it disappeared.

441
00:40:04,234 --> 00:40:07,692
It's amazing how quickly
a light can go out.

442
00:40:14,444 --> 00:40:16,537
Lana, you're shaking. Are you okay?

443
00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:24,580
No. No, I don't think so.

444
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:28,923
I guess it hasn't sunk in yet.

445
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,960
Lana.

446
00:40:34,564 --> 00:40:39,001
Whitney's mom just called.
He's missing in action.
