1
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,674
Is something wrong?

2
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,750
Lex, what's happening?

3
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,633
Lex, where are you going?

4
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,958
Come on, Lex. Pick up.

5
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,713
Lex!

6
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,115
- Lex!
- Stay there.

7
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,833
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

8
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,913
Stay away from her!

9
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,558
- What are you doing?
- I'm preparing him.

10
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,269
No!

11
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,391
People have been buying airline tickets
long before computers.

12
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,395
So glitch or no glitch, there has to be
some record of us being on this flight.

13
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,120
Can I talk to your supervisor?

14
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,349
Actually, let me talk
to your supervisor's supervisor.

15
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,074
Lionel.

16
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,629
I thought you'd be on your way
to Washington by now.

17
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,153
Come in.

18
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,680
No. Unfortunately...

19
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,276
...thanks to the airline company's
cutting-edge computer system...

20
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,839
...the flight was canceled.

21
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,675
That's easily solved. The Luthorcorp jet
is free to take you this afternoon.

22
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,150
No, no. I can't continue
taking favors from you.

23
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,437
Don't make this personal, Martha.
It's business.

24
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,556
It's the way to cope
with an emergency.

25
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,712
The important thing
is that you get there for the meeting.

26
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,235
It's a national education summit.

27
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,188
There will be over 3000 people there.

28
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,396
I'll be wearing my inexperience
like a badge.

29
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,998
Well, experience is often overrated,
especially in Washington. You...

30
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,392
You've got integrity, Martha.

31
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,398
It's one of the rare <i>qualities...</i>

32
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,791
...you possess.

33
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,272
Hey. I was beginning to think
I was living with a ghost.

34
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,476
Not that it would be the first time.

35
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,437
- Lana, are you all right?
- I'm so scared, chloe.

36
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,918
- I knew he was getting in too deep.
- Who?

37
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,357
Lex. They took him.

38
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,909
Tell me what happened.

39
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,473
We were in a field...

40
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,154
...and there was this flash of light
and Lex was taken.

41
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,712
Taken where?

42
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,670
Into the black ship I saw
in the meteor shower. It's back.

43
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,193
Do you think Fine had something
to do with this?

44
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,075
Fine was there.

45
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,628
He said that he was preparing him.

46
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,592
I can't believe I let this happen.

47
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,273
Lana, you can't blame yourself.

48
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,795
It's my fault he was involved
in the first place.

49
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,590
Chloe...

50
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,509
<i>...what</i> if he's dead?

51
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,958
What, do you mean "taken"?

52
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,351
I mean, ripped from the earth
and sucked into the sky.

53
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,909
His abductor did leave
a calling card in the field.

54
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,833
From Lana's description,
it sounded a lot like Zod's symbol.

55
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,595
Lionel's drawings
warned of Zod coming.

56
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,430
Maybe it's actually happening.

57
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,556
What is happening? I don't get it.

58
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,838
I thought that Zod was trapped in that
Phantom-prism other-dimension thing.

59
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,911
That's what I'm worried about.

60
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,514
Fine knows I would not
release Zod willingly.

61
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,875
He's obviously changed strategies.

62
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,749
- So then Lex is part of plan B?
- Which means Lana's in the middle.

63
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,799
I know what you're thinking. She used
to come to you. That's different now.

64
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,315
And you know what?
That was your choice.

65
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,474
I don't feel like I've made any
of the right choices.

66
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,552
I've been so angry with Jor-EI,
I didn't listen to his warnings.

67
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,712
It seems every time you turn to Jor-El
something bad happens.

68
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,677
What if he's just trying to protect me?

69
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,153
What if he's trying
to protect all of us?

70
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,070
<i>Hello, my son.</i>

71
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,595
I had no other choice
but to come here.

72
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,958
<i>I know you are still angered</i>
<i>by the loss of Jonathan Kent.</i>

73
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,917
- He was my father.
- <i>I am your father.</i>

74
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,991
<i>Pain is part of life, Kal-EI.</i>

75
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,628
<i>But you cannot let it blind you.</i>

76
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,234
Fine has returned...

77
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,755
...to release Zod.
What am I supposed to do?

78
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,153
<i>Fine is merely an extension of the craft</i>
<i>that can regenerate in any form.</i>

79
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,392
If Fine is part of the ship,
then who is controlling it?

80
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,869
<i>It's not just a ship.</i>

81
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,157
<i>It's the Brain InterActive Construct.</i>

82
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,551
<i>An advanced technology that will</i>
<i>stop at nothing until its master...</i>

83
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,473
<i>... Zod, has been released.</i>

84
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,551
No, there's gotta be
some way to stop him.

85
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,631
<i>There is one way.</i>

86
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,836
<i>Zod was imprisoned</i>
<i>in the Phantom Zone...</i>

87
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,630
<i>... for crimes that led to the</i>
<i>destruction of our planet.</i>

88
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,199
Zod killed you.

89
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,510
<i>And your mother.</i>

90
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,194
<i>And our entire race.</i>

91
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,238
<i>Just as he will do on Earth.</i>

92
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,913
I won't let that happen.

93
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,718
<i>Zod's physical body was destroyed...</i>

94
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,475
<i>... to prevent him from escaping</i>
<i>the Phantom Zone.</i>

95
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,112
<i>He can be freed if he finds a body,</i>
<i>a vessel to inhabit.</i>

96
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,230
<i>You must find the human vessel</i>
<i>and destroy it.</i>

97
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,234
<i>No matter who it may be.</i>

98
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,675
I've heard of fathers demanding
a lot of sons...

99
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,432
...but asking you to commit murder?

100
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,309
- That goes way beyond domineering dad.
- Chloe, I'm not killing anyone.

101
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,156
Well, I hate to say this, but disobeying
Jor-El has had grim consequences.

102
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,194
There's gotta be another way.

103
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,598
Okay, well, what about...?
What about the vessel?

104
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,718
I mean, why doesn't this Zod guy
come fully composed?

105
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,792
All Jor-El told me was that Zod's spirit
would possess a human.

106
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,555
This is the Zod whose hobbies include
mass destruction and world domination?

107
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,549
Chloe, what if Lex is the vessel?

108
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,318
That's why the ship took him.

109
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,790
Lana said that Fine was preparing him.

110
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,310
If I'm <i>right...</i>

111
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,994
...then I gotta kill Lex.

112
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,994
You know, Clark...

113
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,470
...in certain cultures, when a father
presents his son with a knife...

114
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,315
...it represents a rite of passage.

115
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,078
How do you know this is from Jor-EI?

116
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,755
The glyphs on the blade,
they're Kryptonian.

117
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,354
What does Jor-El want you
to do with the dagger?

118
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,234
Clark...

119
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,391
...I came here to find you.

120
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,709
When I woke up this morning,
I found this.

121
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,189
Must have written it in my sleep.

122
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,071
It's another warning from Jor-EI?

123
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,835
Tell me what it says.

124
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,352
"Sacrifice the vessel."

125
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,351
The vessel? I don't understand.

126
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,189
Let me help you.

127
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,920
Clark, please.

128
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,072
You don't have to
make this decision alone.

129
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,152
There's nothing you
or anybody else can do.

130
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,278
Don't underestimate me, son.

131
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,508
Jor-El wants me to kill...

132
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,756
...the person who will be the vessel.

133
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,990
Zod will possess a human form.

134
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,311
Destroy Earth just as he did Krypton.

135
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,992
But I can't kill anyone.

136
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,799
You of all people should know that.

137
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,916
Clark...

138
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,792
...the real test of a hero...

139
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,715
...is knowing when the greater good
will be served by an evil act.

140
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,632
To save the Earth...

141
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,110
...the cost of one life
is the price that must be paid.

142
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,917
Even if that life is your son?

143
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,351
Lex is the vessel of Zod.

144
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,238
He was abducted this morning.

145
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,158
Out of Maier's field.

146
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,754
Maier's field, you say?

147
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,834
Lex?

148
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,954
Lex?

149
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,394
Son.

150
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,438
- Are you all right?
- Everything feels different.

151
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,389
Clark told me they'd taken you.
What happened, son?

152
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,434
Are you hurt?

153
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,192
You tried to warn me about Fine,
but I didn't listen.

154
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,271
You never have.

155
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,714
No matter what I give you...

156
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,236
<i>...the</i> things you've always wanted
were beyond your grasp.

157
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,550
This time you've overreached yourself.

158
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,995
Did you come out here
to lecture me or to help me?

159
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,116
It's too late to do either, isn't it?

160
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,158
You made a deal with the devil.

161
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,150
He always comes to collect.

162
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,912
Lex.

163
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,669
Dad, are you okay?

164
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,751
What have they done to you, Lex?

165
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,794
What have they turned you into?

166
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,111
Lex.

167
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,070
I thought I'd never see you again.

168
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,514
It's okay.

169
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,794
What happened?

170
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,551
I've been given a gift.

171
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,991
Your hand.
There's not a scratch on it.

172
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,311
You need to know the truth about me.

173
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,473
They've turned you into one of them.

174
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,270
I have their abilities...

175
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,237
<i>...but</i> it's still me.

176
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,398
Lana...

177
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,120
<i>...I'd</i> never lie to you.

178
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,558
How could I keep
something like this...

179
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,679
...from the person I care about most?

180
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,072
Lex.

181
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,031
I overheard Clark and Chloe talking.

182
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,469
Now that you're <i>back...</i>

183
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,517
...Clark...

184
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,598
<i>...he's</i> going to try and kill you.

185
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,512
It's fear, Lana.

186
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,792
My father's infected him with it.

187
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,989
Like he used to do to me.

188
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,318
Clark can't stand the fact
that I'm different now.

189
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,588
- There's someplace I need to go.
- Take me with you.

190
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,318
No.

191
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,916
Hey.

192
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,878
Know that I'll always love you.

193
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,997
You're talking like
we'll never see each other again.

194
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,273
That's your choice.

195
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,317
If you want us to be together...

196
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,311
...meet me on the roof
of LuthorCorp Plaza.

197
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,357
I'll be there tonight.

198
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,596
You found Lex.

199
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,832
Yeah. He was...

200
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,911
<i>...in</i> the field. He's... He's not...

201
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,599
He's changed.

202
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,519
What happened to you?

203
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,073
Everything Fine has been doing is...

204
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,232
It was meant to prepare Lex.

205
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,428
Somehow he now possesses
the same powers as you, Clark.

206
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,520
You can't begin to imagine
what he's gonna do with them.

207
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,794
Why do you say that?

208
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,997
He wasn't raised like you, clark.

209
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,430
I taught him to survive at any cost,
to be completely ruthless.

210
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,513
Maybe that's what'll save him. There's
still a part of Lex that can fight this.

211
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,477
You see that in him
because you want to.

212
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,393
There's always been a dark force
at work inside him.

213
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,835
I don't wanna hurt Lex.

214
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,157
If Zod is as evil
as you believe him to be...

215
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,314
<i>...it's</i> easy to understand why
he chose Lex to inhabit as his vessel.

216
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,719
What about Lana?

217
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,151
Someone very close to you.

218
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,788
She's a big part of his life right now.

219
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,876
Be careful what you
decide to do, Clark.

220
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,677
Which one are you willing to sacrifice?

221
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,835
If you'll be 20,000 feet above the
ground, might as well do it in luxury.

222
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,797
Well, enjoy it while you can.

223
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,033
If our flight hadn't been canceled,
I'd never feel comfortable doing this.

224
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,638
Well, you might wanna start
finding your comfort zone.

225
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,475
This isn't gonna be the last time
you're invited to fly the Luthor skies.

226
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,276
This is just a friendly gesture.

227
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,311
Right.

228
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,272
Look, another friendly gesture.

229
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,836
Card's for you.

230
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,192
Lionel can be a very generous man.

231
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,679
I'm not interested in a relationship
with Lionel or anyone.

232
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,831
- Really?
- Yes.

233
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,800
Or are you just worried
about how Clark would take it?

234
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,474
Okay. Enough said.

235
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,036
Lex!

236
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,191
Lex!

237
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,838
- You'll never find him.
- Lana, he's in trouble.

238
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,560
I suppose you're gonna tell me
you came here to help.

239
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,678
- I don't want anything to happen to him.
- Like what?

240
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,796
Having your best friend
turn against you?

241
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,233
I heard you and Chloe
talking about killing Lex.

242
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,198
I don't know how you knew
he was gonna come back different...

243
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,157
...but I guess
I shouldn't be surprised.

244
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,232
Lana, you can't stay with him.
He's not what you think.

245
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,713
He told me his secret and it doesn't
change the way that I feel about him.

246
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,717
What's happened,
it doesn't scare you?

247
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,553
I am not going to abandon Lex.

248
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,676
Neither am I.

249
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,511
Listen, Fine would not give him powers
without expecting something in return.

250
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,759
It's not over, Lana.

251
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,150
I can help him
if you tell me where he is.

252
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,512
How do I know you won't hurt him?

253
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,149
- You know me.
- No, I don't.

254
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,952
You have all these different sides to you.
I can't tell if any of them is the real you.

255
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,557
If you have ever
really cared about me...

256
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,748
<i>...tell</i> me what's happening to Lex.

257
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,034
- Lana, please.
- You don't trust me.

258
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,514
You've never trusted me, have you?

259
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,398
I don't know how
I could have ever loved you.

260
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,159
And to think her loyalty
could have been yours...

261
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,356
<i>...if</i> you'd been honest with her.

262
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,478
I'm sure Zod
will cherish her allegiance.

263
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,719
Leave Lana out of this.

264
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,320
It's your own fault, Kal-EI.

265
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,312
You were supposed to be the vessel...

266
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,830
<i>...but</i> your father's spirit
was too strong in you.

267
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,994
If you'd have released Zod
the first time...

268
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,310
...they would have been spared.

269
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,513
I'm giving you one more chance.

270
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,393
Nothing could make me
release a monster like Zod.

271
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,712
Except maybe your one weakness:

272
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,274
Humans.

273
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,953
They're so fragile. They'll never survive
without their technology.

274
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,991
No matter how crude.

275
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,109
Take that away, and they'll devolve
back to the animals they really are.

276
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,592
And you can't save all of them.

277
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,151
I'll never do what you want.

278
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,551
Then it begins.

279
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,838
Enjoy the show.

280
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,153
Chloe! Chloe?

281
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,471
- What's going on? Streetlights are out.
- You tell me.

282
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,678
It's already reached Metropolis.

283
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,954
- You know where it started?
- Smallville.

284
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,350
Fine did something
to one of Lex's computers.

285
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,353
Thought if anyone could figure out
what it was, it'd be you.

286
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,910
It's an electronic virus and it's
spreading faster than I can track it.

287
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,390
After it scaled every firewall and
knocked down all the communication...

288
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,391
<i>...it's</i> infecting the infrastructure.

289
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,919
All because of me.

290
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,629
I refused to release Zod.
Now Fine's trying to force my hand.

291
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,473
Well, he's definitely playing hardball.

292
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,191
Elevators, gas mains, subways,
the entire city is shutting down.

293
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,476
I mean, it's like Y2K on acid.

294
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,832
<i>The complete and sudden collapse</i>
<i>of the city's infrastructure...</i>

295
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,798
<i>... has caused havoc and panic</i>
<i>throughout Metropolis.</i>

296
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,238
<i>Reports of scattered looting</i>
<i>and violence are beginning to surface...</i>

297
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,950
Clark, if this continues...

298
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,635
...every major city in the world
is gonna be infiltrated.

299
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,198
Clark, there's no use.

300
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,318
You can't save everyone.

301
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,873
And I can't release Zod.

302
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,519
Well, what if Jor-El was right?

303
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,558
I mean, what if the only way
to stop Zod and stop Fine...

304
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,395
...and stop all of this
is to just destroy that vessel?

305
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,232
I don't wanna leave you here.

306
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,078
You have to.

307
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,312
Clark.

308
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,388
I don't know
if I'm ever gonna see you again.

309
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,428
<i>Hello, Clark.</i>
<i>I heard you wanna see me.</i>

310
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,872
You'd tell me if I had drool
all over my face, wouldn't you?

311
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,955
- What time is it?
- It's about 10 minutes to 9.

312
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,872
And we aren't there yet?

313
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,429
We should be strolling down
Pennsylvania Avenue now.

314
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,989
You're right. I lost track of the time.

315
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,116
We must have hit
some strong headwinds.

316
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,714
More like gale-force.
We should've landed an hour ago.

317
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,509
Lois, relax. There are a million reasons
why we could've been delayed.

318
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,238
I'm sure everything's okay.

319
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,594
I might have flunked geography
but the last time I checked...

320
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,037
...the East Coast,
it didn't look like this.

321
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,877
So, what did you decide, Clark?

322
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,839
Are you gonna kill me?

323
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,280
You can't blame me for this, Lex.

324
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,394
You did this to yourself.

325
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,636
Oh, come on, Clark.

326
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,877
You love it!

327
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,953
Since that day on the bridge...

328
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,918
...you've always seen yourself
as my savior.

329
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,598
The one thing that would pull me
off the dark path I'd started.

330
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,548
See, that's why you cling to the idea
that there's still some good in me.

331
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,837
You don't wanna face the fact
that you might have failed.

332
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,112
Or maybe I can't believe someone
would have so little willpower.

333
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,754
It's hard to compete
with the willpower it takes...

334
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,434
...to kill one of your best friends.

335
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,119
How did you know
I was gonna come back like this?

336
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,550
You don't realize
how much danger you're in.

337
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:55,152
I used to think you had
this strong inner core.

338
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,880
You were so virtuous.

339
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,515
And yet you lie...

340
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,594
...all the time.

341
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,954
To me, to Lana,
to all the people who cared about you.

342
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,314
What kind of sick person
would do that?

343
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,436
If you thought this friendship
was so doomed...

344
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,479
...then why did you fight to keep it?
- Because I wanted everything you had.

345
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,350
The family, the inconspicuous life,
the loyal girlfriend.

346
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,274
Well, at least I walked away
with the part you loved the most.

347
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,956
You're not yourself.

348
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,234
Or maybe I finally am.

349
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,437
I knew there was something
different about you.

350
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,150
Do it, Clark.

351
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,195
Let's see if you're really
your father's son.

352
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,399
What have I done?

353
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,675
You've opened the portal for Zod.

354
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,515
Lex?

355
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,439
Lex?

356
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,636
You have your father's eyes.

357
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,152
Hello, Kal-EI.

358
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,919
- Where's Lex?
- Lex is dead.

359
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,314
Why are you here?

360
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,479
For the same reason as anyone
who'd been imprisoned like a beast.

361
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,829
Revenge.

362
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,233
Your father banished me
to an eternal hell...

363
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,632
...trying to save a doomed race.

364
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,393
And in the end, the only survivor
of his pathetic crusade...

365
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,756
...was his son.

366
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,155
Then this is between us.

367
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,518
- These people did nothing to harm you.
- No.

368
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,274
But you feel no pain greater
than to see others in agony.

369
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,072
I won't let you destroy this planet
like you did Krypton.

370
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,678
You don't have a <i>choice...</i>

371
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,159
...unless you join me.

372
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,633
I'll never join you.

373
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,835
Well, I hope that's a decision
you'll be able to live with forever.

374
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,270
Open the door!

375
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,151
Lois, I'm not feeling well.

376
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,151
- Neither am I.
- I can't breathe.

377
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,470
Wait a minute, Mrs. Kent.

378
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,080
The air pressure. We need oxygen.

379
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,754
Open the door!

380
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,431
Mrs. Kent.

381
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,512
Mrs. Kent. Wake up!

382
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,151
You have to stay awake.

383
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,597
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

384
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,672
No!

385
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,395
Help! Please let me in!

386
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,949
Help!

387
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,394
Get in.

388
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,953
Ron, get us out of here.

389
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,350
- Oh, my God!
- Ron!

390
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,517
Mr. Luthor!

391
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,512
No!

392
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,118
Lex.

393
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,592
You know...

394
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,399
...part of me thought this was
another one of your tests.

395
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,559
You've been abandoned and betrayed
so many times...

396
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,109
...how could you know
that I wouldn't be next?

397
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,398
Well, I'm not. I'm here.

398
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,674
In spite of everything
that's happening out there, I'm here.

399
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,555
I don't know what it is
you and I have...

400
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,753
<i>...but</i> I'm here
because I wanna find out.

401
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,478
Do you?

402
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,151
