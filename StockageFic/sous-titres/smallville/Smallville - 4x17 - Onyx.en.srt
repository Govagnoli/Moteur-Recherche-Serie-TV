1
00:00:06,928 --> 00:00:09,574
Are you sure you've corrected the problem, Dr. Sinclair?

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,458
Absolutely, Mr. Luthor.

3
00:00:12,223 --> 00:00:16,589
The simulations have all been positive.
Increasing thermal variance by 98%

4
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:19,595
should eliminate the separation impurity.

5
00:00:20,044 --> 00:00:22,889
Six months of this,
and all you had to do was turn up the heat?

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,153
Well, it's not that simple, Mr. Luthor.

7
00:00:27,182 --> 00:00:30,433
I mean, the composition of these
meteor rocks is highly unusual.

8
00:00:30,462 --> 00:00:32,984
Calculating the exact temperature was a challenge.

9
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:34,697
One I hope you're up to.

10
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,878
If this works, I'll leave a mark on the world
no one will ever forget.

11
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:40,615
It won't hurt your bank account, either.

12
00:00:44,564 --> 00:00:46,348
Initiating sequence.

13
00:00:48,668 --> 00:00:50,950
Thermal sequence initiating.

14
00:00:57,316 --> 00:00:58,961
Increasing thermal output.

15
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,869
70%.

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,845
Come on, come on...

17
00:01:02,873 --> 00:01:05,747
Approaching optimum thermal reaction.

18
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,704
Opening the irradiation samples.

19
00:01:14,072 --> 00:01:17,428
Subject seeds exposed to radiation.

20
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,685
90%.

21
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,398
Absorption level as expected.

22
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:26,585
Irregular molecular stimulation noted in subject seeds.

23
00:01:26,614 --> 00:01:28,211
95%.

24
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,167
98%. Power objective attained.

25
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:35,483
Molecular activity exceeding control model.

26
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,167
Thermal level continues to accelerate.

27
00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:40,709
- Thermal levels exceeding safety parameters.
- What's happening?

28
00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:43,535
The temperature is climbing past the target range.

29
00:01:43,564 --> 00:01:44,413
Shut it down.

30
00:01:44,432 --> 00:01:45,519
I'm trying, sir. I'm trying.

31
00:01:45,547 --> 00:01:48,638
Thermal levels exceeding safety parameters.

32
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:50,436
Get outta here!

33
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:23,703
Doc, are you okay?

34
00:02:31,906 --> 00:02:33,635
I'm calling this one a failure.

35
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:36,859
Come on Dr. Sinclair, I'll get you in a hospital.

36
00:02:55,509 --> 00:03:00,939

40
00:03:46,964 --> 00:03:48,056
Lex, are you okay?

41
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:48,890
Clark,

42
00:03:49,264 --> 00:03:50,444
I'm fine.

43
00:03:50,632 --> 00:03:52,172
How did you know I was here?

44
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:56,277
One of your EMTs is a friend of mine.
She said there was an explosion at Luthorcorp?

45
00:03:56,295 --> 00:03:57,168
What happened?

46
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:00,212
We were conducting an experiment.

47
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:01,818
Well, I'm guessing it didn't go well.

48
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:05,019
Not exactly as I hoped, but it was worth the risk.

49
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:06,766
I'm sure it was...

50
00:04:07,518 --> 00:04:09,594
To Luthorcorp's bottom line.

51
00:04:09,922 --> 00:04:11,328
To the world, Chloe.

52
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:14,077
Look, why don't the two of you come with me to the lab,

53
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:16,995
and I'll show you what Dr. Sinclair and I
have been working on?

54
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,680
I really think you're gonna like this one.

55
00:04:26,977 --> 00:04:28,399
All right, let's go.

56
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:33,584
Clark, wait, I'm not buying any story
from a Luthor without corroboration.

57
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:37,547
So I'm gonna go talk to Dr. Sinclair
and find out what he has to say about this.

58
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:40,095
Okay. I'll check out the lab with Lex.

59
00:04:40,142 --> 00:04:43,876
Just be careful, okay?
I mean, no matter what he says,

60
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:46,575
Luthorcorp experiments never end well.

61
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,912
Wow...

62
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,917
That looks like it hurts.

63
00:05:04,126 --> 00:05:05,641
What happened?

64
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:09,224
Well, I was hoping you could tell me.

65
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,148
There was an explosion.

66
00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:15,283
Do you remember anything else after the accident?

67
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,534
Anything unusual?

68
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:20,098
Like what?

69
00:05:20,896 --> 00:05:22,834
Like seeing two of me?

70
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,884
What?

71
00:05:25,943 --> 00:05:30,475
I think the explosion caused some kind of separation...

72
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:34,303
A division at the molecular level.
I don't know, but...

73
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,085
I saw myself, Doctor.

74
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,136
I saw another Lex Luthor.

75
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:44,482
My God.

76
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:47,943
What about reversing it?

77
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:51,795
Is there any way to force the two "me"s back together?

78
00:05:52,088 --> 00:05:55,716
My research notes are back in the lab. If...

79
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:58,145
If I had those...

80
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,489
I might be able to find a way to reverse the process.

81
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:09,044
I'm gonna go back to the lab

82
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:11,686
and get the notes.

83
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:17,887
In the meantime,

84
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:23,065
why don't you get some rest?

85
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:45,991
Lex?

86
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:47,776
Chloe.

87
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:49,852
I thought you left for the lab with Clark.

88
00:06:49,981 --> 00:06:52,740
Well, I just wanted to check in on Dr. Sinclair first.

89
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:54,466
Hmm. Was he all right?

90
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:56,556
Not feeling a thing.

91
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,970
Well, I was hoping I could maybe talk to him.

92
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:03,023
Well, he's sleeping now.

93
00:07:04,643 --> 00:07:08,446
Maybe you should come back later...
When he's feeling a little more alive.

94
00:07:08,505 --> 00:07:09,031
Okay.

95
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:13,471
Code blue - room 213.
Code blue - room 213.

96
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:24,790
He's arresting. Fibrillator.

97
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:40,072
This is what your secret experiment was about... Gardening?

98
00:07:40,107 --> 00:07:41,305
No, Clark,

99
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:43,207
it's about the future.

100
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:45,555
These are growing in common sand,

101
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:47,995
with only a few drops of water as irrigation.

102
00:07:49,662 --> 00:07:53,290
If my dad planted a crop of these,
he'd never have to worry about the harvest again.

103
00:07:53,326 --> 00:07:55,228
Until it arrived on your dinner table.

104
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:57,549
Taste it.

105
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,234
Those were grown from irradiated seeds.

106
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,717
- Something's wrong. It tastes...
- ... rotten?

107
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,549
That's what we've been wrestling with.

108
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:11,848
See, we've successfully destroyed the genes
that make a plant weak,

109
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:14,817
giving it the ability to thrive
under the harshest conditions.

110
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:18,562
But the process also affects the fruit it bears,
and not for the better.

111
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:22,429
Is that what you were trying to fix
when the explosion happened?

112
00:08:22,992 --> 00:08:27,501
Dr. Sinclair thought increasing the temperature
of the reaction would solve the problem.

113
00:08:27,994 --> 00:08:32,045
We pushed it further than we ever have, Clark,
but the meteor rock became unstable.

114
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:34,059
What, you're working with meteor rocks again?

115
00:08:34,106 --> 00:08:36,606
If I can find a way to make this work,

116
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:40,117
Luthorcorp could put an end to hunger and famine forever.

117
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:44,688
I'm hoping there's something in Dr. Sinclair's notes
that'll explain exactly what went wrong.

118
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,598
Clark, are you all right?

119
00:08:54,927 --> 00:08:55,768
Yeah, um,

120
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,244
I don't think that apple's sitting very well.
I'll wait for you outside.

121
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:18,402
Lex.

122
00:09:19,928 --> 00:09:22,323
I haven't forgotten. I know I'm...

123
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:26,102
I'm not welcome here,
but I heard there was an accident at Luthorcorp,

124
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,568
and I wanted to be sure you were all right.

125
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,129
I'm fine, dad.

126
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:32,663
Thanks for the concern.

127
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:35,728
Well, I'm...

128
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,037
I'm grateful you're all in one piece.

129
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:43,856
Sorry. I'm sorry for the intrusion.

130
00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:44,948
Dad...

131
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:50,255
Are you still planning on your

132
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,332
charity fundraiser saturday?

133
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:53,224
Yes.

134
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,191
I must say, it's quite an interesting challenge trying to...

135
00:09:58,226 --> 00:10:02,897
Get the deep pockets to show up
for a salad bar and ginger chicken.

136
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:06,948
Would it help if the head of Luthorcorp
promised to make an appearance?

137
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:08,824
Really.

138
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:10,420
You'd do that?

139
00:10:11,231 --> 00:10:12,957
Under one condition.

140
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:14,811
Oh.

141
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:20,950
You hold the event on the top floor
of Luthorcorp plaza in Metropolis.

142
00:10:22,148 --> 00:10:26,234
I'll even reach out to a few of those reluctant deep pockets.

143
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:29,293
That's very generous of you.

144
00:10:29,805 --> 00:10:32,119
Oh, you must be rubbing off on me.

145
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:40,392
I admit, I had my doubts about the motives
behind your sudden philanthropy,

146
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:44,874
but I can see how much joy
helping the less fortunate is bringing you.

147
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:46,462
Dad, I'm...

148
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,053
I'm proud of you.

149
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:58,713
Thank you, Lex.

150
00:11:00,521 --> 00:11:02,247
I'm truly grateful.

151
00:11:04,677 --> 00:11:06,045
For everything.

152
00:11:31,535 --> 00:11:33,754
Amazing work, isn't it?

153
00:11:36,055 --> 00:11:37,229
Hello, me.

154
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,353
Meet the real you.

155
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,064
Well, I can't have you running about, can I?

156
00:12:10,651 --> 00:12:11,861
Who are you?

157
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:16,181
Well, that's a question
I've been struggling with for years.

158
00:12:16,674 --> 00:12:19,410
Hey, remember the last time we were in this room?

159
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,306
Dad told us not to play down here,
but I whispered in your ear to do it anyway?

160
00:12:24,717 --> 00:12:26,505
The door blew shut,

161
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:30,145
locking me in. No one could hear me.

162
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:32,728
You were so afraid.

163
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:35,705
A scared,

164
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:37,948
trembling child.

165
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,118
I hated you for that.

166
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:42,621
My god...

167
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,321
You're me.

168
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:46,212
No, Lex.

169
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:48,454
I'm much, much more.

170
00:12:57,074 --> 00:12:58,847
The explosion in the lab...

171
00:12:58,882 --> 00:13:00,632
freed me from your weakness.

172
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:03,997
At last, I can embrace my true destiny.

173
00:13:08,294 --> 00:13:11,042
Yeah! Come on! Come on! You can do it!

174
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,226
Stop me! Come on!

175
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,223
You disappoint me.

176
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,203
As always.

177
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:26,092
If I'm such a letdown, why don't you just kill me?

178
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:29,664
Nothing would make me happier.

179
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:33,679
Unfortunately, I don't know
what will happen to me if you die.

180
00:13:33,806 --> 00:13:36,095
Are we somehow still connected?

181
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:40,851
Would I cease to exist...
as you gasp your last breath?

182
00:13:43,587 --> 00:13:45,869
I'm not keen on taking that chance.

183
00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:48,805
You can't keep me locked down here forever.

184
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,815
Why?

185
00:13:50,954 --> 00:13:53,760
No one heard our screams when we were a child.

186
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:55,754
No one will hear yours now.

187
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,994
Just like in that Dumas story.

188
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,672
It was always one of our favorites, wasn't it?

189
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,198
King Louis XIV imprisons his twin brother in the bastille,

190
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:08,380
forcing him to live out his final days

191
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:11,480
behind an iron mask.

192
00:14:12,748 --> 00:14:13,488
No.

193
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:18,595
See, most people think Louis did it
to hide his brother's true identity, but...

194
00:14:18,631 --> 00:14:20,028
We know better.

195
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:27,322
He did it because he couldn't stand looking
at such a pale reflection of his own greatness.

196
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:28,603
Don't...

197
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:32,191
No! No!

198
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:42,750
Shh, shh, shh.

199
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,174
It's good to be the king.

200
00:14:57,051 --> 00:15:00,538
I guess it's up to me
to show the world the real Lex Luthor.

201
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:17,002
Chloe.

202
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,047
Hey.

203
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:20,783
It's about time...
Pretty slow for the quarterback.

204
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:23,777
Ex-quarterback. What's so important?

205
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,256
Dr. Sinclair.

206
00:15:25,362 --> 00:15:27,990
Did he say something about the explosion at Luthorcorp?

207
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:29,399
He couldn't.

208
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:31,489
He's dead, Clark.

209
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:33,483
What? What happened?

210
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:34,763
Cardiac arrest.

211
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:37,827
In a guy with no history of heart problems.

212
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,340
Well, I'd better go tell Lex.

213
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,956
He already knows, I think.

214
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,971
I bumped into him coming out
of Dr. Sinclair's room just before he died.

215
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:48,192
When was this?

216
00:15:48,862 --> 00:15:50,640
Right after you left for the lab.

217
00:15:51,286 --> 00:15:53,740
Wha... Chloe, I was with Lex.

218
00:15:53,892 --> 00:15:56,111
We went to the lab together.

219
00:15:56,816 --> 00:16:01,098
Which would be about the same time
I was talking to Lex outside Dr. Sinclair's room.

220
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:02,425
Well, that's impossible.

221
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,994
Not in Smallville.
You of all people should know that.

222
00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:08,542
You know...

223
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:11,597
Because of all the weird stuff you've seen.

224
00:16:13,147 --> 00:16:15,131
Well, there must be a way to figure out the timeline.

225
00:16:15,176 --> 00:16:18,146
Yeah, there is. Smallville medical center
has a surveillance system

226
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:22,690
which, as far as you know, I've never hacked into
because that would be wrong.

227
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:24,989
It's just gonna take a while.

228
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:26,774
Call me if you find anything.

229
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:40,678
Lex.

230
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:44,246
What are you doing here?

231
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:48,801
I got a message on my cell that you wanted to see me.

232
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:52,124
So you just let yourself in?

233
00:16:52,336 --> 00:16:53,519
My bad.

234
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:55,938
Would you like me to go?

235
00:16:56,513 --> 00:17:00,881
No, no, uh, it's okay.
You kinda just surprised me.

236
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:03,991
I've been doing that to a lot of people.

237
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:09,533
So what can I do for miss Lang this afternoon?

238
00:17:09,556 --> 00:17:11,608
I wanted to talk to you about Jason.

239
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:13,757
Oh.

240
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,378
Him.

241
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:22,533
I, uh, I really appreciate everything that
you've already told me about Jason and his mom,

242
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:23,507
um,

243
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:25,480
but do you really think...

244
00:17:25,515 --> 00:17:27,159
What I think, Lana,

245
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:30,177
is you deserve better.

246
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:36,228
You deserve to be with someone who

247
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:40,525
recognizes how extraordinary you are.

248
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:50,784
Lex, what are you doing?

249
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:54,585
What I've always wanted to.

250
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:02,875
Well, I do like them feisty.

251
00:18:03,063 --> 00:18:05,364
Get out of my apartment.

252
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,429
If that's how you want to play it.

253
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,550
Oh, by the way, I'm closing the Talon.

254
00:18:12,873 --> 00:18:13,789
What?

255
00:18:14,141 --> 00:18:15,891
You can't do that.

256
00:18:16,877 --> 00:18:19,742
Hmm... I think I can.

257
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:23,171
Lex, this is my home. Where am I supposed to go?

258
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:25,121
That's really up to you, isn't it?

259
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:29,248
Lana, you could live like a queen by my side,

260
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:32,459
or get tossed out with the rest of the garbage.

261
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,161
Why don't you think about it?

262
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,274
I know I will.

263
00:19:04,398 --> 00:19:05,103
Lex,

264
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,874
what's going on? What the hell are you doing?

265
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,905
Seizing the moment, dad.

266
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:14,131
Just like you taught me.

267
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,442
Same time tomorrow?

268
00:19:27,247 --> 00:19:30,124
Now, what's your problem with me this time, old man?

269
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:33,759
It was your offer to hold the fundraiser
at Luthorcorp plaza,

270
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:37,421
then you go behind my back and cancel the whole thing.
Why would you do that?

271
00:19:37,473 --> 00:19:42,785
"Because helping those who refuse to help themselves
is a waste of time and money, son!"

272
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:46,284
Isn't that what the old Lionel Luthor used to say?

273
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:49,419
I've changed. People change. Lex...

274
00:19:49,548 --> 00:19:53,161
No, they don't.
They just get soft... Like you.

275
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,143
All right, dad,

276
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:58,924
I'll let you have your little blue plate charity soiree.

277
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,943
I'll even make a generous contribution.

278
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:04,326
And what would I have to do in exchange
for this contribution, hmm?

279
00:20:10,713 --> 00:20:11,324
Ah...

280
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:19,241
I want you to prove you're still worthy
to be my father.

281
00:20:19,264 --> 00:20:20,838
Are you insane? Lex...

282
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:23,363
No. Just curious.

283
00:20:23,398 --> 00:20:25,136
I'm not going to fight you!

284
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,388
Lex! Stop it! Lex! Stop it!

285
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:34,385
Is your miraculous transformation
into the man in the white suit genuine,

286
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:35,888
or is it all just an act?

287
00:20:35,924 --> 00:20:39,399
Lex, stop this! Stop it now! Lex, stop it!

288
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:44,269
Do you even know the answer to that question,
or have you been too afraid to ask?

289
00:20:44,305 --> 00:20:48,379
What's inside you, dad? Is it really just puppies
and hugs now, or is there something else

290
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,746
twisting in your gut, squirming to be free again?

291
00:21:01,183 --> 00:21:03,787
I knew you were in there somewhere, father.

292
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:20,307
You should've stayed in prison.

293
00:21:21,903 --> 00:21:23,955
You were safer there.

294
00:21:52,453 --> 00:21:53,322
Lana?

295
00:21:57,255 --> 00:21:58,312
Are you okay?

296
00:21:58,981 --> 00:21:59,756
Yeah.

297
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:04,761
No.

298
00:22:05,313 --> 00:22:06,194
Uh,

299
00:22:07,603 --> 00:22:10,773
did you know that Lex is going to close the Talon?

300
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,053
No.

301
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:14,639
Who told you that?

302
00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:15,895
He did.

303
00:22:16,212 --> 00:22:18,443
Well, I saw him last night. He didn't mention anything.

304
00:22:18,478 --> 00:22:22,327
Clark, when I, um, when I came home,
he was in my apartment.

305
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:24,194
The way he was acting... It was...

306
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:26,930
It was like he was a totally different person.

307
00:22:27,622 --> 00:22:29,064
Maybe he was.

308
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:33,526
Do you think that maybe he's having another psychotic break?

309
00:22:35,158 --> 00:22:37,330
It's more complicated than that.

310
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:41,182
It always is, isn't it?

311
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:44,470
You think you know someone,

312
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:47,311
but there's this side of them that you never see...

313
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,673
Until it's too late.

314
00:22:57,683 --> 00:23:00,123
Well, you've certainly seen me at my worst.

315
00:23:01,097 --> 00:23:02,812
And at your best.

316
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:06,933
Lana...

317
00:23:11,803 --> 00:23:12,684
Hello.

318
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:13,612
Clark,

319
00:23:13,864 --> 00:23:16,527
I found surveillance footage of Lex and me

320
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,239
outside of Dr. Sinclair's room talking.

321
00:23:19,521 --> 00:23:20,754
And

322
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,347
of you and Lex leaving the med center.

323
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:26,049
What about the time stamps?

324
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:30,640
They're identical.

325
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:35,783
Looks like our favorite billionaire
has one hell of a split personality.

326
00:23:36,069 --> 00:23:36,973
Yeah.

327
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:38,829
Thanks.

328
00:23:50,234 --> 00:23:51,103
Lex.

329
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:54,261
I need to talk to you.

330
00:23:55,823 --> 00:23:57,361
This is important.

331
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:02,101
Well, I always have time for a friend, Clark.

332
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,827
What's on your mind?

333
00:24:05,565 --> 00:24:07,174
What did we talk about last night?

334
00:24:08,592 --> 00:24:10,863
We talked about a lot of things...

335
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,449
The future...

336
00:24:14,316 --> 00:24:16,214
Changing the world...

337
00:24:16,261 --> 00:24:18,844
Reshaping it into a better place.

338
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:22,883
And then you started to feel sick.

339
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,243
You said it was from the apple.

340
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:27,935
That's right.

341
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:31,868
Clark, what's this all about?

342
00:24:32,714 --> 00:24:35,027
Well, I had to be sure who I was talking to.

343
00:24:36,996 --> 00:24:37,865
What?

344
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:42,996
Lex, Dr. Sinclair is dead.
Someone murdered him.

345
00:24:46,624 --> 00:24:49,011
Clark, who would do something like that?

346
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:50,396
Well, you would.

347
00:24:52,134 --> 00:24:53,285
Well, I mean...

348
00:24:54,612 --> 00:24:56,504
At least someone who looks like you.

349
00:25:03,162 --> 00:25:04,700
Where did you get these?

350
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:08,571
Chloe pulled them off the surveillance system
at the medical center.

351
00:25:08,617 --> 00:25:10,738
She saw you leaving Sinclair's room

352
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,994
at the same time we were going to Luthorcorp.

353
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,942
How is this possible?

354
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:19,066
Something must've happened
when the meteor rock exploded during your experiment.

355
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,551
What are you saying...

356
00:25:20,624 --> 00:25:23,361
This other Lex is some kind of copy?

357
00:25:23,433 --> 00:25:25,989
I think he's a part of you that split off.

358
00:25:27,204 --> 00:25:30,789
I'm gonna put a security team together.
Get Chloe, and meet me at the lab.

359
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,584
How will I know it's you?

360
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,109
Well, we can always try a secret handshake.

361
00:25:38,326 --> 00:25:41,825
But I like to think you know me better than anyone
after all those years.

362
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:45,106
Clark, this whole mess is my fault.

363
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:47,462
But I'll put an end to all of it tonight.

364
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,858
I want to thank you two for bringing this to my attention.

365
00:25:53,894 --> 00:25:56,349
My security team is working to contain the situation.

366
00:25:56,377 --> 00:25:57,869
Is there anything we can do to help?

367
00:25:57,897 --> 00:25:58,633
Excuse me.

368
00:25:59,455 --> 00:26:00,304
Hello.

369
00:26:01,786 --> 00:26:03,127
I'll be right there.

370
00:26:03,986 --> 00:26:05,817
This could be what I was hoping for.

371
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,935
I'll be right back. Don't worry.
This will all be over soon.

372
00:26:10,181 --> 00:26:12,626
Keep an eye out for the security guard.

373
00:26:16,145 --> 00:26:17,343
Chloe, what are you doing?

374
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:19,514
Snooping where I don't belong.

375
00:26:19,555 --> 00:26:21,308
I'm thinking of making a career out of it.

376
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:23,170
Lex said he was gonna be right back.

377
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,011
How can you be sure it was really him?

378
00:26:26,087 --> 00:26:28,841
I was careful. Besides, I think I know my own friend, Chloe.

379
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:33,769
Clark, how many times has your friend
done something underhanded that you didn't expect?

380
00:26:34,118 --> 00:26:37,723
People have a lot of different sides,
and sometimes, they keep those sides hidden,

381
00:26:37,751 --> 00:26:39,516
even from the ones that they love.

382
00:26:41,489 --> 00:26:44,179
Sometimes you have to, even if that's not what you want.

383
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:48,279
Yeah, but sooner or later, you have to trust someone
with what's in your heart.

384
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:51,111
Otherwise, you're gonna end up going through life alone.

385
00:27:11,945 --> 00:27:12,643
Clark.

386
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,409
Clark.

387
00:27:15,365 --> 00:27:16,677
What'd you find?

388
00:27:33,555 --> 00:27:35,360
Situation contained.

389
00:27:53,712 --> 00:27:54,609
Chloe.

390
00:27:55,116 --> 00:27:56,096
Chloe?

391
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:12,714
We really should get you to the hospital.

392
00:28:12,761 --> 00:28:15,954
Yeah, because that worked out really well for Dr. Sinclair.

393
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,810
Clark, I'm fine, okay?
Although,

394
00:28:19,058 --> 00:28:22,810
I still can't figure out how I survived
the sky falling on my head,

395
00:28:22,845 --> 00:28:23,825
can you?

396
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:30,126
Well, the last thing I remember is I grabbed you
and we dove underneath the lab table.

397
00:28:31,353 --> 00:28:33,607
It must've protected us from the debris.

398
00:28:35,188 --> 00:28:37,934
Good thing our ex-quarterback moves so fast.

399
00:28:38,689 --> 00:28:40,636
Yeah, well, not fast enough.

400
00:28:42,229 --> 00:28:43,091
Clark,

401
00:28:43,704 --> 00:28:47,492
I can live with a couple of bruises,
considering the alternative.

402
00:28:49,365 --> 00:28:51,831
You're always there when I need you, Clark.

403
00:28:53,117 --> 00:28:55,878
I just hope, someday, I can do the same for you.

404
00:28:56,979 --> 00:28:59,268
Right now I just want to make sure you're safe.

405
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:04,447
I can... I can stay with Lois at the military base.

406
00:29:04,482 --> 00:29:06,547
Perfect. Although,

407
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:09,178
getting between her and the general
while they're trying to reconcile

408
00:29:09,218 --> 00:29:11,295
might be just as dangerous.

409
00:29:11,814 --> 00:29:13,348
Watch out, okay?

410
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:17,212
Lex can be devious enough.
There's no telling what his evil twin is capable of.

411
00:29:17,247 --> 00:29:18,368
I'll be on my cell.

412
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:26,273
Okay. But if you see him, call me.

413
00:29:26,312 --> 00:29:27,516
And be careful.

414
00:29:28,035 --> 00:29:29,781
Lex really isn't himself.

415
00:29:29,817 --> 00:29:32,731
He's more dangerous than we thought.
Thanks, Lana.

416
00:29:33,156 --> 00:29:35,272
Is that what you think of me, Clark?

417
00:29:35,755 --> 00:29:36,971
I'm hurt.

418
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:39,012
I thought we were friends.

419
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,449
Where's Lex?

420
00:29:46,095 --> 00:29:47,947
He's standing right in front of you.

421
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,399
No, you're not him.

422
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,604
The real Lex would never try to kill me or Chloe.

423
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,952
Well, you're probably right.

424
00:29:54,988 --> 00:29:56,852
But he's thought about it.

425
00:29:58,374 --> 00:30:02,742
All the times you've meddled in his plans...
derailed his ambitions.

426
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:06,365
He's thought about killing all of you,
just never had the guts to go through with it.

427
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:07,827
What are you?

428
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,521
I was just about to ask you the same question.

429
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:17,963
I dropped half the lab on you and miss Sullivan, and yet,

430
00:30:18,423 --> 00:30:19,906
here you stand.

431
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,707
I was lucky.

432
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:26,497
Don't be modest, Clark.
We both know you're much more than that.

433
00:30:28,763 --> 00:30:30,878
It all makes sense now.

434
00:30:31,173 --> 00:30:34,099
That first day on the bridge when we met...

435
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:37,592
How you were able to save me when my car went into the river.

436
00:30:37,981 --> 00:30:40,698
All of the other miraculous times you appeared

437
00:30:40,746 --> 00:30:43,672
in just the right place at just the right moment...

438
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:48,632
Almost as if you possessed powers and abilities
beyond those of mortal men.

439
00:30:51,062 --> 00:30:53,457
You've lied to me for years, Clark.

440
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:58,149
But now I know your secret.

441
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:01,288
I don't know what you're talking about.

442
00:31:01,323 --> 00:31:02,306
Don't!

443
00:31:03,604 --> 00:31:06,235
I saw you after the explosion.

444
00:31:06,294 --> 00:31:09,893
You lifted a half a ton of concrete
like it was nothing.

445
00:31:11,757 --> 00:31:14,644
I should've figured it out a long time ago.

446
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:17,606
All the pieces were there. I was just...

447
00:31:17,971 --> 00:31:19,930
Blinded by friendship.

448
00:31:20,072 --> 00:31:22,896
A factor that's been removed from the equation.

449
00:31:23,733 --> 00:31:25,421
Whatever you are,

450
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:28,418
whatever you're planning, I'm gonna stop you.

451
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:30,345
No, you aren't.

452
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,024
You're gonna join me.

453
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:33,873
What?

454
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:35,596
Think about it, Clark.

455
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,920
My intellect, your powers.

456
00:31:37,956 --> 00:31:40,272
Together, we could rule this world.

457
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,269
We'll walk as gods among men.

458
00:31:43,753 --> 00:31:46,278
You're not a god. I'm not even sure you're human.

459
00:31:47,104 --> 00:31:48,009
Are you?

460
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:52,375
Is the real Lex still alive?

461
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,912
Oh... You don't get it, do you?

462
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:56,870
I am the real Lex!

463
00:31:56,906 --> 00:31:58,487
Is he still alive?

464
00:31:58,851 --> 00:31:59,961
Sort of.

465
00:32:02,332 --> 00:32:06,427
I mean, I couldn't really be sure what
would happen to me if I killed him, so...

466
00:32:06,462 --> 00:32:08,810
I tucked him away where I can keep an eye on him.

467
00:32:08,963 --> 00:32:11,787
Maybe torture him a little when I'm feeling blue.

468
00:32:13,462 --> 00:32:14,607
Where is he?

469
00:32:14,937 --> 00:32:16,093
Where is he?

470
00:32:20,195 --> 00:32:21,870
What's the matter, Clark?

471
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:24,926
You look a little sick.

472
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,522
Just like in the lab when you were with the other me...

473
00:32:30,124 --> 00:32:33,062
When he opened the safe door
and exposed you to the...

474
00:32:33,711 --> 00:32:35,033
Meteor rock.

475
00:32:44,674 --> 00:32:47,388
Every man has a weakness, Clark...

476
00:32:48,236 --> 00:32:50,808
no matter how superhuman he may be.

477
00:32:51,257 --> 00:32:53,133
I've embraced my destiny.

478
00:32:54,077 --> 00:32:56,071
Now embrace yours.

479
00:32:56,295 --> 00:32:58,856
We could forge a new future together.

480
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:00,767
I'll never join you.

481
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:02,458
Yes, you will.

482
00:33:02,694 --> 00:33:05,667
Or everyone you love will suffer!

483
00:33:17,488 --> 00:33:18,409
Clark!

484
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:19,530
Mom!

485
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,701
Son!

486
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:23,309
Dad!

487
00:33:23,344 --> 00:33:24,559
My god, Clark!

488
00:33:26,436 --> 00:33:27,675
You're bleeding!

489
00:33:28,324 --> 00:33:30,959
I'm guessing that doesn't happen very often.

490
00:33:31,006 --> 00:33:32,080
Lex...

491
00:33:33,543 --> 00:33:34,912
What did you do?

492
00:33:37,389 --> 00:33:39,086
I gotta hand it to you guys.

493
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:41,670
I mean, keeping something like this a secret

494
00:33:41,836 --> 00:33:45,470
must've required an impressive ability to obscure the truth.

495
00:33:46,355 --> 00:33:49,521
Maybe the Kents and Luthors
have something in common after all.

496
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,371
Yeah...

497
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,368
I know about the green meteor rock

498
00:33:57,557 --> 00:33:59,663
and Clark's unique gifts.

499
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,855
What do you want?

500
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,895
The world, Mrs. Kent.

501
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:05,327
And your son is gonna help me bring it to its knees.

502
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:08,772
Now talk some sense into him
before something unfortunate happens!

503
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:11,994
Like that.

504
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,268
Dad?

505
00:34:22,172 --> 00:34:24,709
You were right about me all along, Mr. Kent.

506
00:34:27,611 --> 00:34:30,010
I am the villain of this story.

507
00:34:39,086 --> 00:34:40,537
Two Lexes?

508
00:34:41,127 --> 00:34:43,204
How the hell did that happen?

509
00:34:43,758 --> 00:34:47,440
There was an accident at Luthorcorp,
and I think that Lex was affected...

510
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,236
By black kryptonite.

511
00:34:50,815 --> 00:34:53,116
How did Lex get a hold of black kryptonite?

512
00:34:53,152 --> 00:34:56,691
Well, I don't he knows anythingabout the black K.
I think he accidentally created it

513
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,922
when he was experimenting with the meteor rocks.

514
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:02,061
But that's how I can put the two Lexes back together.

515
00:35:02,096 --> 00:35:02,934
How?

516
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:06,663
The duplicate Lex in the barn...
He said he was keeping the real Lex alive...

517
00:35:06,698 --> 00:35:09,530
Somewhere close to keep him safe...
And if I can find him...

518
00:35:09,695 --> 00:35:10,678
Clark!

519
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:31,023
Lex.

520
00:35:45,814 --> 00:35:46,687
Clark...

521
00:35:46,723 --> 00:35:47,844
Don't try to talk.

522
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:48,622
Get out.

523
00:35:48,658 --> 00:35:50,546
No, you're gonna be okay, all right?

524
00:35:51,796 --> 00:35:52,776
Get out.

525
00:35:58,526 --> 00:36:00,721
The hero comes to the rescue.

526
00:36:01,146 --> 00:36:03,010
How predictable is that?

527
00:36:03,836 --> 00:36:05,480
Leave him alone.

528
00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:08,866
I'm really starting to hate the sound of my own voice.

529
00:36:11,332 --> 00:36:14,970
I offer you a chance at greatness,
and this is what you do with it?

530
00:36:17,082 --> 00:36:18,722
I want you to remember this day, Clark.

531
00:36:19,197 --> 00:36:21,737
I want you to remember that, despite all your amazing powers,

532
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:23,782
there was one man that beat you.

533
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:37,672
Maybe this was always our destiny.

534
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:39,371
How sad.

535
00:36:41,313 --> 00:36:43,945
Let's see what happens to me if you die!

536
00:36:48,015 --> 00:36:49,738
You can't kill me!

537
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,199
I drive you!

538
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,795
I give your life meaning!

539
00:36:55,786 --> 00:36:59,102
I'm your soul, you weak, pathetic, little man!

540
00:36:59,149 --> 00:37:01,430
I'm the real Lex Luthor!

541
00:37:26,315 --> 00:37:27,212
Lex!

542
00:37:30,737 --> 00:37:31,610
Lex.

543
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,813
It's all right. It's over now.

544
00:37:56,843 --> 00:37:59,024
It's not much to look at, is it?

545
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:03,178
Broken dreams seldom are.

546
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,493
Clark...

547
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,851
I want to say thank you for saving me, but...

548
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,930
Words seemed too small.

549
00:38:15,016 --> 00:38:17,086
Without you, I would've been lost.

550
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:19,469
You're a true friend.

551
00:38:20,566 --> 00:38:22,974
It's too bad your other half didn't think so.

552
00:38:23,894 --> 00:38:25,868
I'm sorry for what I...

553
00:38:26,364 --> 00:38:27,933
He put you through.

554
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,992
How much of it do you remember?

555
00:38:32,712 --> 00:38:34,210
Nothing, really.

556
00:38:34,803 --> 00:38:37,564
Once we divided, we were two different people.

557
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,103
Well, you might want to go talk to Lana
when you get a chance.

558
00:38:42,075 --> 00:38:43,664
He didn't hurt her, did he?

559
00:38:43,703 --> 00:38:45,709
Well, I'm not sure what happened, but...

560
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:47,880
She seemed pretty upset.

561
00:38:50,564 --> 00:38:53,319
Don't be too hard on yourself. It really wasn't you.

562
00:38:54,649 --> 00:38:57,670
That's what I've been standing here,
trying to figure out.

563
00:38:59,243 --> 00:39:02,476
Did the accident create an evil Lex...

564
00:39:04,246 --> 00:39:06,441
Or is that what's really inside of me?

565
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:15,555
Hi.

566
00:39:17,466 --> 00:39:18,225
Hey.

567
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,031
As far as awkward moments go, this is definitely memorable.

568
00:39:34,296 --> 00:39:36,479
Chloe filled me in on what happened.

569
00:39:40,636 --> 00:39:43,610
I wish I could remember exactly what my other half did

570
00:39:43,657 --> 00:39:45,922
so I could apologize properly.

571
00:39:47,492 --> 00:39:50,941
I just hope it wasn't anything we can't get past.

572
00:39:51,802 --> 00:39:55,307
Well, as long as you're not closing the Talon
and kicking me out...

573
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,032
I said that?

574
00:40:00,451 --> 00:40:03,696
Along with expressing certain...

575
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,242
desires.

576
00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:09,834
Lana, I'm sorry.

577
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,185
- It wasn't me.
- Are you sure?

578
00:40:16,335 --> 00:40:18,565
Look, whatever my feelings are,

579
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,894
I'd never do anything to jeopardize our friendship.

580
00:40:26,162 --> 00:40:27,071
I know.

581
00:40:41,724 --> 00:40:43,506
I really am sorry.

582
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:57,882
So am I.

583
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:07,446
Planning your next assault, son?

584
00:41:07,835 --> 00:41:08,697
Dad...

585
00:41:09,015 --> 00:41:10,089
Your cheek.

586
00:41:10,207 --> 00:41:10,969
Well,

587
00:41:11,264 --> 00:41:14,249
it's a wake-up call,
and I'm grateful for that.

588
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:15,901
Look,

589
00:41:16,526 --> 00:41:18,981
whatever I've done in the last few days...

590
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,548
Please, no need for an apology.
Quite the contrary.

591
00:41:29,694 --> 00:41:33,646
I must say, you finally proved yourself
to be the son I've always wanted.

592
00:41:33,918 --> 00:41:38,685
And I thank you for showing me so clearly
the error of my ways.

593
00:41:40,887 --> 00:41:42,787
What are you talking about?

594
00:41:47,377 --> 00:41:50,185
I'm closing down the foundation immediately.

595
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:51,795
What?

596
00:41:53,648 --> 00:41:56,043
You can't. The charity is your life.

597
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,264
Ha, ha, ha... Just a foolish dream.

598
00:41:59,312 --> 00:42:00,790
I'm awake now.

599
00:42:05,628 --> 00:42:09,174
A man can't deny his true nature, can he, Lex?

600
00:42:13,351 --> 00:42:14,507
No...

601
00:42:15,073 --> 00:42:16,501
We're Luthors.

602
00:42:23,951 --> 00:42:25,437
We're Luthors.
