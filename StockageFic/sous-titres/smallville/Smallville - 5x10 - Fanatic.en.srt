1
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,232
<i>And now, the next senator</i>
<i>of the state of Kansas...</i>

2
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,311
<i>... Mr. Jonathan Kent.</i>

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,399
Thank you.

4
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,759
Thank you, really.
Thank you.

5
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,999
Thank you all very much
for coming out here this evening.

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,397
I'm sure that many of you had
more important things to do tonight...

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,079
...than listen to some farmer...

8
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,470
...talk about the importance
of corn subsidies.

9
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,870
When I told my family that I had indeed
decided to run against Lex Luthor...

10
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,116
...they were surprised, to say the least.

11
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,588
I don't think they really understood
why I want to run.

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,235
Or why this is
so very important to me.

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,990
But the truth is actually...
It's actually very simple.

14
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,191
The courage to help all Kansans, whether
they're rich or whether they're poor.

15
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,357
And do my very best to put the heart
back in the heartland.

16
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,832
Thank you.

17
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,192
Mr. Luthor,
this is your itinerary for tomorrow.

18
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,079
Push the mayor lunch
and get me a photo op at the hospital.

19
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,074
- Yes, sir.
- The nurses' union is key in the 49th.

20
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,471
One more thing. I need the new
poll numbers from last night.

21
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,278
Yes, sir.

22
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,556
Central Kansas Students
for Lex Luthor, sir.

23
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,474
You have 5 minutes tops.

24
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:38,239
Thucydides said, "We are either kings
among men or the pawns of kings."

25
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,631
The fact that you're here demonstrates
that you strive for the former.

26
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,873
The youth vote is stronger
than we ever expected...

27
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,078
...and I have you to thank for that.

28
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,996
But we cannot afford to be complacent.

29
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,718
Great leaders are forged from those
who see beyond the boundaries...

30
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,157
...who go beyond the extra mile.

31
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,111
They go the extra 10.

32
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,952
Defeat is not an option.

33
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,590
Samantha Drake,
president of Students for Lex Luthor.

34
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,315
Well, then I should thank you personally
for my spike in the MTV vote.

35
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,436
It's such an honor to finally meet you.

36
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,989
I know it is kind of geeky,
but I'd be so <i>psyched...</i>

37
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,878
...if I could get a picture with you.

38
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,713
Well, anything I can do
to keep up morale with the troops.

39
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,432
Excuse me. Thank you.

40
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,959
Could you get the painting
in the background?

41
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,834
That's what your father gave you after
you closed the Metrotech deal, isn't it?

42
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,794
Well, looks like you've done
your homework, Miss Drake.

43
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,472
Thank you very much.

44
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,197
Used to wear a cross.

45
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,833
Sir, the limo is waiting.

46
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,630
Thank you very much.

47
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,836
- This is Lex.
- <i>You wanted a grenade to throw...</i>

48
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,070
<i>.... In the Kent camp.</i>
<i>I got an atomic bomb.</i>

49
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,673
This isn't a secure line.

50
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,871
Just meet me
at Rampart and Broadway.

51
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,952
Atomic warfare?

52
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,594
A little overdramatic
for local politics, isn't it?

53
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,992
I got no problems
ending this conversation right now.

54
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,830
I believe in the political weapons trade...

55
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,156
...the deal usually goes
to the highest bidder.

56
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,039
Thank you.

57
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,313
Is this for real?

58
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,470
Sosnik had it all trucked up
from Metropolis.

59
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,359
I keep expecting some mobster
with a carnation to step out and plug me.

60
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,555
I have to admit, it's not exactly us.

61
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,717
You sure this guy
knows what he's doing?

62
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,916
Clark, Sosnik helped Jack
win five elections.

63
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,992
I'm sure he knows more about this stuff
than we do.

64
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,790
I think he's trying
to turn you into a Luthor.

65
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,709
Is there a problem?

66
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,598
I was just wondering
if you've ever actually met the Kents.

67
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,997
You see someone is gonna vote
for Mr. Kent because they relate to him.

68
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,839
And who is gonna believe
that he supports local farmers...

69
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,151
...when he looks like some business
blowhard... No offense, Mr. Kent.

70
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,594
- Who wants to buy them out?

71
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,548
Yeah, well, that's called
bridging the demo gap, dear.

72
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,513
Does bridging the gap also include
misquoting the candidate?

73
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,757
Wait a minute. It says,
"Jonathan Kent is quoted as saying:

74
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,515
'It's possible to serve corporate interests
and maintain the public welfare.'"

75
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,432
- I never said that.
- I did.

76
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,551
- You did?
- Yes.

77
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,275
Look, this whole John-boy thing...
Don't get me wrong, you're good at it.

78
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,670
You may win the cowpokes,
but there's a pool of <i>voters...</i>

79
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,628
...that are more familiar with lattes
than they are with digging post holes.

80
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,796
What I really need here is somebody...

81
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,555
...who cares about what I believe in
more than they care about winning.

82
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,355
I'm sorry, but you gotta go, Sosnik.
You're fired.

83
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,196
- Pack it up, guys.
- I'll go ahead.

84
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,591
Not that that didn't totally rock,
Mr. Kent.

85
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,274
But I have no idea how you're gonna
find a replacement.

86
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,559
I do.

87
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,909
Oh, me?

88
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,430
What do I know about being
a campaign manager?

89
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,756
What do I know
about being a state senator?

90
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,354
Right.

91
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,952
I'll get it.

92
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,672
Jonathan Kent.

93
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,071
<i>This is your last warning</i>
<i>to drop out of the campaign.</i>

94
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,595
I told you not to call here again.

95
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,316
Hey, what are you doing?

96
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,029
Sorry, but CKU regulations dictate
that all campaign materials...

97
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,237
...can be no larger than 20-by-24.

98
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,353
Okay, I think you're taking this
campus gestapo thing way too seriously.

99
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,438
The state's future depends on it,
Ms. Lane.

100
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,234
How do you know my name?

101
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,034
- Lex says, "Always know your enemy."
- Leave it to Lex...

102
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,589
...to treat this election like
a hostile takeover...

103
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,399
...which is what he's gonna do
to the entire state.

104
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,591
Progress requires sacrifices.

105
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,554
Mr. Kent is neck and neck with
your fascist environmental annihilator.

106
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,630
You heard what Lex said:
"True leaders see beyond boundaries."

107
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,678
He set the bar.
Now we need to raise it higher.

108
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,354
Defeat is not an option.

109
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,839
Coming.

110
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,191
- Hi.
- Hi.

111
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,991
It looks like someone's
had a long day of campaigning.

112
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,232
More like a long day of Lois.

113
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,830
Well, as much as I'd like to make a fool
of myself at the ice rink...

114
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,918
...we could always stay in tonight.

115
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,593
Okay.

116
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,477
What happened? Did I hurt you?

117
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,036
Unless you're the one who assigned
six diagrams on planetary rotation.

118
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,790
On second thought,
maybe we should go.

119
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,234
Okay, this couldn't be more awkward.

120
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,312
But we haven't been together
since I came to Met U.

121
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:54,079
- You mean we haven't <i>had...</i>
- Sex.

122
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,800
Clark, you can't tell me
that you haven't noticed.

123
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,471
Things between us
haven't been the <i>same...</i>

124
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,349
...since you miraculously
came back from the dead.

125
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,118
I know. L...

126
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,558
Lana, I can't explain that anymore.
It changed me.

127
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,669
Maybe I'll never understand
what you went through...

128
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,035
<i>...but</i> you're still the same person,
aren't you?

129
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,231
Clark, I don't know. It's <i>just...</i>

130
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,757
Feels like you're afraid
to touch me anymore.

131
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,313
Did something happen?

132
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,838
Clark?

133
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,870
Okay, is this where
I have to remind you...

134
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,430
<i>...that</i> you said we wouldn't
keep things from each other anymore?

135
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,798
Why is this about me?

136
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,799
You pulled away first.

137
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,032
You moved to Metropolis
two weeks after we got together.

138
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,397
And now you spend every moment
with these books.

139
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,034
- Why astronomy?
- It's homework.

140
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,912
It's an obsession.

141
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,074
And that thing about honesty,
it works both ways.

142
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,397
Nice deflection.

143
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,672
But I don't fall for that anymore.

144
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,199
I'm gonna go get some air.

145
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,872
Now, just who in the hell are you?

146
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,674
Are you the one
that's been calling me?

147
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,277
Hey!

148
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,790
Are you the guy that's been calling me?
Stay away from me and my family.

149
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,440
It's obviously true what they say.

150
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,433
"Behind every great man,
is a great woman."

151
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,948
The campaign must be taking up
a lot of your time.

152
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,835
Yes, it is. But, fortunately,
Jonathan and I have a lot of help.

153
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,157
Unfortunately, not enough to win.

154
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,636
You know, Lex is entering
the last stretch of the campaign...

155
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,268
...with infinite resources.

156
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,270
And I believe you are down, financially,
to nothing.

157
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,279
I'm glad to see you're finally
behind your son.

158
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,870
I thought you knew me better
than that, Lionel.

159
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,230
I would never give up on my husband.

160
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,758
You misunderstand me.

161
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,915
Lex has deep pockets...

162
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,757
...and Jonathan needs at least
the money to match that.

163
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,874
This is more than money to match.

164
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,954
We've run this campaign
on his beliefs...

165
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,680
<i>...and</i> that's what's gonna win him
the election.

166
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,398
Jonathan would never accept this.

167
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,989
I know. I fully expected Jonathan...

168
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,517
...to barrel his way through
the campaign fueled by blind idealism...

169
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,354
...but I was hoping
you'd be more savvy.

170
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,036
Perhaps you have your own personal
reasons...

171
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,875
...for wanting Jonathan not to win.

172
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,070
I know you didn't come by this late
just to drop off this press release.

173
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,514
What happened?

174
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,956
Well, how far do you wanna cross
this friendship boundary?

175
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,112
Since when did we have boundaries?

176
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,358
All right. Why don't you just
leave out the details.

177
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,630
Well, everything was fine
between Lana and I, when I was human.

178
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,711
I mean, it was great.

179
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,118
Okay. Clark?

180
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,839
But now that I have my abilities back,
it's like our sex <i>life...</i>

181
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,759
...has been on hiatus.

182
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:27,159
I know I'm going to regret
asking this question, but why?

183
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,270
Because it just takes some time for me
to adjust my abilities to new situations.

184
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,072
Awkward factor eight.

185
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,953
So basically, what you're saying
is that...

186
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,590
...you're afraid that in the heat
of the moment you might...

187
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,233
Please don't make me finish
this sentence, Clark.

188
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,235
Well, you see, that's the thing.
I'm not sure what would happen.

189
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,116
- Lf I couldn't control myself...
- You know what?

190
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,589
That's something
that can never be unseen.

191
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,189
- It's not funny.
- No, you're right, it's not.

192
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,035
It's just that this conversation definitely
cements me as your krypto-hag.

193
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,316
Look, Clark...

194
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,593
You can shake my hand
without crushing it, right?

195
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,150
And you don't incinerate everyone
you look at with your heat-vision thing.

196
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,238
So it's pretty much
the same thing, right?

197
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,113
I mean, metaphorically.

198
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,998
But you didn't need me
to tell you all this. So, what gives?

199
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,552
I think I got used to lying to Lana
when we were friends.

200
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,951
- Now it's different.
- Yeah.

201
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,793
You know, Clark, I mean,
I'm playing my best on <i>defense...</i>

202
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,428
<i>...but</i> I think you're in denial
about what Lana knows.

203
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,473
I mean, she's studying astronomy.

204
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,519
The meteors, the fact that
the undead topic comes up daily.

205
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,194
- I can't just tell her. It's too risky.
- Okay, fine.

206
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,437
Don't tell her. Your game has
to switch from defense to offense...

207
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,592
...because sooner or later, Lana will ask
all the wrong people...

208
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,113
...all the right questions.

209
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,397
You didn't say much on the ride home.
Are you sure everything's okay?

210
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,235
Yeah, I'm fine. I'll just be glad
when the election is over.

211
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,348
Shelby, hi.

212
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,670
What's the matter?

213
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,757
What's wrong?

214
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,709
I moved the rally to next week
so Mr. Kent can recover.

215
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,194
- Or not.
- Dad, what are you doing?

216
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,713
I can't let them stop me.

217
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,757
I will tell them the rally's a go again.

218
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,558
I thought the doctor said
he was going to keep you overnight.

219
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,228
No, then they'd have
exactly what they want.

220
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,591
It's not the first time they've called,
is it, Dad?

221
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,954
Jonathan, how could you keep this
from us?

222
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,712
We're in this as a family.

223
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,434
Are we? You were never happy
about me running...

224
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,033
...and now you want me to quit.

225
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,358
Maybe you're willing to risk your life
over this, but I'm not willing to watch.

226
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,835
I have got to see this thing through,
Martha.

227
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,792
Do as I say, not as I do, huh, Dad?

228
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,269
Look, I never taught you
to buckle under pressure.

229
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,998
Especially not from Lex Luthor.

230
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,474
Lex?

231
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,839
You think he'd go this far?

232
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,878
There's no limit
to what Lex Luthor would do, son.

233
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,474
Clark, I heard what happened.

234
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,358
I wanna make sure
your father's okay.

235
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,035
Trust me, this is about as close to
my father as you wanna get right now.

236
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,633
He thinks I was behind it?

237
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,035
- What do you expect him to believe?
- The truth.

238
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,470
I issued a press release
denouncing the attack...

239
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,110
...and offered a reward for information
leading to the assailants' capture.

240
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,237
Lex, why is some state senate seat
so important to you?

241
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,270
It's a stepping stone.

242
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,429
To what?

243
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,354
It's like Apollo asking Icarus
why he's building wings.

244
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,314
You have everything you've ever wanted.
I'm sorry if I'm still searching.

245
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,999
What if you don't win?

246
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,789
What if you get to the capitol and
haven't found what you're looking for?

247
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,951
There's always the White House.

248
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,631
Look, I promise you, we're gonna
find out who did this to your dad.

249
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,397
Didn't work. We failed him.

250
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,670
Well, now we know
what we need to do.

251
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,355
- And I already have everything in place.
- Samantha, chill out.

252
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,512
We already went too far,
and it totally backfired.

253
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,591
We need to turn ourselves in...

254
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,194
...before somebody points
the finger at Lex.

255
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,756
Lex asked us to go the extra 10 miles.

256
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,398
- Am I the only one willing to do that?
- What are you saying?

257
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,348
There is one thing
that Kent can't bounce back from.

258
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,472
I'm going to the cops
before this gets any more out of control.

259
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,039
Lex would have never...

260
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,115
...given up that easily.

261
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,598
I waited at the drop-off,
but Griff never showed.

262
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,955
Find out what happened to him.

263
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,111
I didn't recognize you for a moment.

264
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,151
I wanted to show you
how devoted I am to you.

265
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,313
Well, you certainly have.

266
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,751
I have all the enabling devices
I need, thank you.

267
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,229
Though, apparently,
I could use better security.

268
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,314
Don't they always say never use
your birthday as your security code?

269
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,120
Or more specifically...

270
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,673
<i>...your</i> brother's?

271
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,191
Interesting choice of perfume.

272
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,279
Hermes. It's your favorite.

273
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,989
I know everything about you,
Mr. Senator.

274
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,798
Senator.

275
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,030
Now, aren't you
a little ahead of yourself?

276
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,312
Not now. Not with Jonathan Kent
out of the picture.

277
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,670
I would never condone
what happened to Mr. Kent.

278
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,399
Of course not.
You've got to distance yourself.

279
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,516
It's like you said in the <i>Herald</i> article:

280
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,513
"Strike when you can,
but never leave yourself vulnerable."

281
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,679
Please tell me you weren't responsible
for that attack.

282
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,791
It's okay, Lex.

283
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,790
I know what you want me to do...

284
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,554
...and I would never want you
to take the fall for it.

285
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,035
You may have read
everything about me...

286
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,595
<i>...but</i> don't assume you know me.

287
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,751
I would never hurt the Kents.

288
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,669
You're losing your edge, Lex.

289
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,788
And you've clearly gone over it.

290
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,392
My security will escort you
to the police station.

291
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,237
You're just having
a moment of weakness.

292
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,070
That's why you need me.

293
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,071
Lex Luthor going <i>Godfather</i>
on your dad? I don't know, clark.

294
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,437
Lex seems like the guy who lives
for the fight as much as the victory.

295
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,068
Here's a list of the calls
logged on our phone today.

296
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,800
Dad pawned that one off
as a wrong number. It's blocked.

297
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,350
I'll let my fingers do the walking.
Just give me a second.

298
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,272
It's not like your dad
to keep something like this a secret.

299
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,711
He's turned into a different person,
like he's got something to prove.

300
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,751
Maybe just to his son.

301
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,790
What does running for senator
have to do with me?

302
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,912
Think about it, Clark.
It must be hard being a role model...

303
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,595
...for a guy who pulls people out of
a burning building and stops missiles...

304
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,432
...all between chores and dinner.

305
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,631
- No one's expecting him to do that.
- True.

306
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,751
But it's not gonna stop him
from trying.

307
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,435
Oh, here we go.
Let's see what we got.

308
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,439
All right.

309
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,592
The call was made from...

310
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,600
The Students for Lex Luthor office
at CKU.

311
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,871
"...to do my part to put the 'heart' back
in the heartland."

312
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,315
- Great closing line.
- They're Martha's words.

313
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,950
I just hope she shows up in time
to hear me say them.

314
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,599
Are you sure you wanna do this?
We have extra security...

315
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,478
<i>...but</i> it's not too late to postpone.

316
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,150
What kind of leader would I be if I let
some pranksters make me back down?

317
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,798
<i>And now, the next senator...</i>

318
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,190
- Jacket?
- Oh, yeah.

319
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,352
- <i>Mr. Jonathan Kent!</i>
- You look wonderful.

320
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,309
- Knock them dead, boss.
- Yeah.

321
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,517
Thank you.

322
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,556
Thank you. Really, thank you.

323
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,836
- Thank you all very much for...
- Excuse me.

324
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,038
Hey.

325
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,113
When I told my family that I had...

326
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,475
...indeed, decided
to run against Lex Luthor...

327
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,676
...they were surprised,
to say the least.

328
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,477
But their support
has been unwavering.

329
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,910
You see, I've been inspired.

330
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,753
I've been inspired by my son,
whose courage seems to...

331
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,477
- Talk about an initiation gone wrong.
- Get up.

332
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,309
Those basic training skills
are looking a little rusty.

333
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,477
Like I said, know your enemy.

334
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,478
Look, magna cum laude psycho...

335
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,190
...you are not gonna shoot
Jonathan Kent.

336
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,879
You're right.

337
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,991
You are.

338
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,314
In fact, it is because of my family
that I have the courage to run at all.

339
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,193
I don't think they really <i>understood...</i>

340
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,432
...why I want to run or why this is
so very important to me.

341
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,196
But the truth is actually...
It's actually very simple.

342
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,950
The courage to help all Kansans,
whether they're rich...

343
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,714
Nobody will ever believe
I would shoot Jonathan Kent.

344
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,396
Really?

345
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,239
Beautiful girl comes to live
under his roof.

346
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,238
His wife gets a little too busy
at that coffee shop.

347
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,472
Suddenly, he fires
a seasoned political consultant...

348
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,240
...and takes the girl
on the campaign trail.

349
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,630
Until it all goes wrong...

350
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,633
...and the spurned lover
gets her revenge.

351
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,354
Now, just aim
at Jonathan's head and shoot.

352
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,397
Didn't General Lane
teach you anything?

353
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,670
Actually, he did.

354
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,239
Get down, sir.

355
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,189
Martha?

356
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,271
- Lois.
- Don't sweat it, Smallville.

357
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,431
Better late than never.

358
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,276
"Regard your soldiers
as your children...

359
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,432
...and they will follow you
into the deepest valleys."

360
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,239
"Look on them as your own
beloved sons, and they..."

361
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,715
"Will stand by you,
even unto death."

362
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,112
You really don't have to quote
<i>The Art of War</i> to me, Dad.

363
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,431
I read it cover to cover three times
before I finished high school.

364
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,355
Although, I still would have preferred
a bike for my 14th birthday.

365
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,353
Yes. Well, despite
your intense studies...

366
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,472
...it seems Jonathan Kent,
after yesterday's <i>theatrics...</i>

367
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,790
...has surged ahead of you
in the polls.

368
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,276
- I didn't have anything to do with that.
- No, no, of course you didn't.

369
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,358
It looks like your disciples
tried to follow in your footsteps.

370
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,478
They have succeeded
in creating quite a mess.

371
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,838
How does it feel, Lex,
to have people worship you?

372
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,828
Being the idol for a cult of psychopaths
isn't exactly a power trip, Dad.

373
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,912
No, but I suppose being
a state senator would be.

374
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,079
Isn't that why
you're running for office?

375
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,112
You wanna know the truth?

376
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,559
I'm running because it's something
I have to work for.

377
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,477
Yes. And your noble efforts
include employing hired guns...

378
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,269
...to dig up information about the Kents
that could destroy them.

379
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,239
Well, so much for your fatherly pride
and support in this campaign, huh, Dad?

380
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,599
Griff's dead.

381
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,917
His body turned up in the back alley
of Suicide Slums this morning.

382
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,548
And somehow, I don't think
the Kents did it.

383
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,268
Dangerous neighborhood, Lex.

384
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,478
Would it have killed you this one time
to actually be on my side?

385
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,674
You're slipping, son.

386
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,595
First Professor Milton Fine vanishes
from your radar. Now, Griff. It...

387
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,550
It might be time to dust this off.

388
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,592
- All the teachers will be there?
- Yes.

389
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,239
All right. Great.

390
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,119
And here are the talking points
for the teachers' union.

391
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,999
- And don't forget...
- I've got the firefighters' breakfast.

392
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,833
Don't worry, Lois,
I'm not gonna forget.

393
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,389
Firefighters. I might have
to tag along for that one.

394
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,677
- There's gotta be a few perks to this job.
- Good news.

395
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,037
You're up 10 points in the polls
after the rally yesterday.

396
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,232
Looks like we can
win this thing after all, huh?

397
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,437
- I gotta run. Bye.
- Bye.

398
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,269
It's great to see him so optimistic.

399
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,038
Yeah.

400
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,668
I hate to be the one
to burst his bubble.

401
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,434
What do you mean?

402
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,154
Lex is running 800 ads
and dropping three mailers...

403
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,639
...in the next two weeks.

404
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,558
We're ahead,
but that much coverage...

405
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,435
...will make Mr. Kent
a distant memory by election day.

406
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,477
And as far as I can tell...

407
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,914
We're out of money.

408
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,199
I've been trying to figure out
how to tell him for a couple of days.

409
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,078
If we don't find some major <i>green...</i>

410
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,471
...he can kiss that fancy leather chair
at the capitol goodbye.

411
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,877
There is one other option.

412
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,915
But you have to promise me
never to tell Jonathan.

413
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,269
Lana.

414
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,918
I wasn't expecting to see you here.

415
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,998
I wasn't about to leave things
the way they were.

416
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,310
- Look, Clark...
- Look, Lana, l...

417
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,110
You were right.

418
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,430
I was pulling away.

419
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,430
It's because I've been wanting
to be with you for so long.

420
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,634
But I feel like I'd just screw it up.

421
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,157
Clark, I would never
let you go that easily.

422
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:05,148
Maybe we just need to slow down
and try and get back to where we were.

423
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,876
I freak out...

424
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,070
...I screw up and I blame everything
on you, and you forgive me.

425
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,751
No questions asked.

426
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,350
Maybe that's because it's not
all your fault.

427
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,480
What you said about me
running off to Met U...

428
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,949
...and getting all caught up
in my homework.

429
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,317
It's not entirely false.

430
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,750
Clark, I've been studying
the meteor showers.

431
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,314
- You were gonna leave that in the past.
- I know I did, and I tried to.

432
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,792
But those meteors changed my life.
And now with the second shower...

433
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,751
Clark, there is no way
that they're random.

434
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,514
What are you saying?

435
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,759
Okay, well, you know that spacecraft
that I saw during this last shower?

436
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,475
I was looking into the satellite imagery
from the first meteor shower...

437
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,511
The one that happened
when we were kids.

438
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,716
- And there's something
that doesn't <i>crash...</i>

439
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,314
...the way the other meteors do.

440
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,030
It... Well, it kind of lands.

441
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,271
Clark, what if a ship came down
in the first meteor shower as well...

442
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,275
...and whoever was in it
has been here with us this entire time?

443
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,190
- Thank you for coming.
- It's my pleasure.

444
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,873
I'm always here for you, Martha.

445
