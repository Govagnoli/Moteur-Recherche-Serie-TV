1
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,429
Dr. Marcus.

2
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,927
What was so urgent you
needed me here tonight?

3
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:40,172
It's Dr. Walden. There's been a complete
normalization of his higher brain functions.

4
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,332
Considering the source of the trauma,
nothing surprises me.

5
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,844
You mean the Kawatche caves?

6
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:51,811
How does a linguist go into a coma
deciphering a Native American language?

7
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,789
If you had that answer, doctor,
you'd be running the place.

8
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:06,057
The day is coming.
The day is coming. The day is coming!

9
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,149
Lana.

10
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,844
It's almost midnight.

11
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,549
Yeah, I took a chance
you'd still be up.

12
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,885
You getting a head start
on your term paper?

13
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,494
I've gotta give the toast
at Lex's rehearsal dinner.

14
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,097
Makes European history
seem like a breeze.

15
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,233
- Am I supposed to guess what's in the box?
- No.

16
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,607
You're supposed to close your eyes.

17
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,652
Don't peek.

18
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,369
Okay.

19
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,769
I know. It's not your birthday
for another seven minutes...

20
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,968
...but I wanted to surprise you.

21
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,646
You did.

22
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,810
I get the feeling
it's not in a good way.

23
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,953
It's just, it's not really
my birthday.

24
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:46,792
It's just some date my parents picked off
the calendar for the adoption papers.

25
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,847
Maybe some of us want to celebrate
the day you came into our lives.

26
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,184
I never thought of it that way.

27
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,650
Make a wish.

28
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:22,025
I've been wishing for the same
thing ever since I was 5.

29
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,838
And now?

30
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,578
And now I don't have to.

31
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,364
She's standing right here
in front of me.

32
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:24,252
- Good morning, Mom.
- How was your birthday party?

33
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,025
So you're the one who told Lana.

34
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,956
She knows we're not
big on birthdays...

35
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,460
...but wondered if she
could do something special.

36
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,326
Thanks.

37
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,434
I feel bad. We never had parties
when you were little...

38
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,264
...but we were always nervous.
- It's okay, I understand.

39
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,701
I know...

40
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:44,570
...but what mother denies her son a birthday
party? It's a huge part of childhood.

41
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,804
All the mistakes you made with me,
you can correct with the baby.

42
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,609
- Wouldn't want to scar the little one too.
- Thanks a lot.

43
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,248
So, last night?

44
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:01,992
- Are you prying?
- Okay, never mind.

45
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:06,894
- Hello. Look what the cat dragged in.
- Lex, have you had breakfast?

46
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,626
Thanks, but I can't stay.

47
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,396
I just wanted to ask you
and Mr. Kent for a favor.

48
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:18,073
I know we've had our differences,
so this might sound strange...

49
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,235
...but it would mean a lot to me.

50
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:27,476
It's customary for the bride and groom to sit
with their parents at the rehearsal dinner...

51
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,353
...so since mine won't be there,
I was wondering...

52
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,125
...would the two of you
consider standing in?

53
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,359
Lex, we would be honored.

54
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,103
Great. That just leaves one
open seat at the table.

55
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,100
Right next to you, Clark.

56
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,040
Any suggestions?

57
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,349
Chloe.

58
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:08,222
The one name you won't find on the list
for Smallville's biggest event of the century.

59
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:14,094
Don't worry, it's not like I'm holding out for
my fairy godmother to bring glass slippers.

60
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:19,227
I'm still not convinced Lex won't have me in
a headset, running around with ice buckets.

61
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:23,034
Is this what you were doing until
2:00 in the morning last night?

62
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,205
Yeah.

63
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:30,714
Well, I can't vouch for my calligraphy skills,
but if you need any help, just let me know.

64
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:35,087
Hey, you guys.
I'd like a double espresso, please.

65
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:40,790
Were you burning
the midnight oil last night too?

66
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,794
I was just...

67
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,196
...working on a toast
for Lex's dinner.

68
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,443
Chloe, ready to go?

69
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,420
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah.

70
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,685
- Great.
- Perfect.

71
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,089
Just checking.

72
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:21,256
Right. Well...
We better get going.

73
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:26,428
I have ashes to sweep
and wicked stepsisters to undermine.

74
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,509
- You didn't...?
- No.

75
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,216
I had a really good time last night.

76
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:42,685
I was thinking maybe we could go out
after the rehearsal dinner tonight.

77
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,616
Maybe.

78
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,397
Lana, is everything okay?

79
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:03,942
If this is about last night,
we can take it slow.

80
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,509
Clark, I think last night
may have been a mistake.

81
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,215
I'm really busy.
I'll call you later?

82
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,255
Here's the revised seating chart
for the rehearsal dinner.

83
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,230
- Who are the people marked in blue?
- Relatives who still talk to each other.

84
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,663
How about the red?

85
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,998
Family feuds and people who haven't
spoken in at least five years.

86
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:37,006
- And the yellow ones scattered throughout?
- Buffer zones.

87
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:41,203
Relatives who have no particular allegiance
and whose conversation won't incite a riot.

88
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,077
If this medical career doesn't work out,
you should consider the United Nations.

89
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,516
- I'm not done yet.
- By the way, put the Kents at our table.

90
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,987
I asked them to sit with us at the dinner,
fill in for my parents.

91
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,557
Lex.

92
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:57,787
I think it's great that you wanna
make them a big part of this, but...

93
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,027
But what?

94
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:03,860
Don't you think this might be the right
moment to reach out to your father?

95
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,568
Helen.

96
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,572
I'm touched that you
want us to reconcile.

97
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,141
But it's not gonna happen.

98
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,373
Besides...

99
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,177
...the only family I need is you.

100
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,500
I don't believe this.

101
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,477
We should call the police.

102
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,582
Is anything valuable missing?

103
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:06,997
Gosh, I'm sorry to hear that, Helen.

104
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:11,899
- They take anything important?
- The vial of blood I drew from Clark.

105
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,074
Tell me why you
would even still have that.

106
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,177
I thought I might need it someday,
in case he got sick again.

107
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,179
It wasn't labeled. There's no way
anyone could connect it to Clark.

108
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,381
Then why would anybody
wanna steal it?

109
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:30,284
It looks like somebody just broke open the
refrigerator and took whatever was inside.

110
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,126
The police think it may have been
junkies looking for drugs.

111
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,991
Or maybe somebody who wanted
to make it look that way.

112
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,098
Are you saying you think
that I staged this?

113
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,465
We're the only ones who knew
about Clark's blood.

114
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,073
- And you never told anybody else?
- Of course not.

115
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,266
Not even the man
you're about to marry?

116
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,472
Mr. Kent...

117
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,841
Lex is not the man
you think he is.

118
00:11:56,182 --> 00:12:00,016
Considering that you're about to
spend the rest of your life with that man...

119
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,620
...and what you know
about my family...

120
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:05,256
...you had better be right.

121
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,531
I don't think it's a good idea
that you seat Lana next to me.

122
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:19,966
What happened?

123
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,371
I wish I knew.

124
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,203
Clark.

125
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,338
None of us really
understands the fairer sex.

126
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,283
It's why we're so
captivated by them.

127
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,291
I went for it last night.

128
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,791
- Don't tell me she shot you down.
- No.

129
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,990
It was the opposite.

130
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,330
It was like this perfect moment,
and then this morning...

131
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,563
She wanted to pretend
it never happened.

132
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,401
You've upped the stakes, Clark,
and she's scared.

133
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,206
She figures if she folds now,
she'll cut her losses.

134
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,441
We're meant to be together.
I've never been so sure about anything.

135
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,347
Yeah, well, don't tell me, Clark.

136
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,381
Tell her.

137
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,798
- Hey.
- Hey.

138
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,172
Come on.

139
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:47,157
- Lana, last night was a big deal for me.
- Clark.

140
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:51,820
Look, you don't have to avoid calling me
if you don't feel the same way.

141
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,023
No, it meant a lot to me too.

142
00:13:55,467 --> 00:14:00,928
Everything seemed so clear, but today
it just feels a lot more complicated.

143
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,775
Is this about Chloe?

144
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:10,005
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't worried about her...

145
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:14,744
...but there are three friendships at stake
here, and I don't wanna risk losing ours.

146
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:20,688
The friendship isn't gonna go anywhere.
It'll just become something better.

147
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:31,092
And what happens down the road
if things don't work out?

148
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:36,473
- Will our friendship survive that?
- I don't know.

149
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,010
Lana, I've wanted this for so long,
I think it's worth taking the chance.

150
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,788
The day is coming.

151
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,116
Clark?

152
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,425
Are you all right?

153
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,190
The day is coming.

154
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,558
Clark, what is it?

155
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,232
I'm sorry, I have to go.

156
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,369
The day is coming.

157
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,983
The day is coming.
The day is coming.

158
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:23,178
- What do you think it means?
- It's probably just delusional rambling.

159
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:28,554
But your scans say his
brain activity is normal again.

160
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,223
The day is coming.

161
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,692
Does that look normal to you?

162
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,534
The day is coming.
The day is coming...

163
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,174
The cataracts, they're gone.

164
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,572
They faded during
the course of a day.

165
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:50,078
- How do you explain that?
- I can't.

166
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,310
I know you want to see if he says
anything else, but for his own safety...

167
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:57,478
...I need to sedate him.
- The day is coming! The day is...

168
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,862
The day is coming.

169
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,345
I think it says,
"The day is coming."

170
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:36,184
- You learned how to read the symbols?
- No, just an educated guess.

171
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,627
It's what Walden kept
saying before he escaped.

172
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,924
I wonder how he wrote it.

173
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:47,596
Apparently, he's developed the ability to
emit some kind of energy from his hands.

174
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:52,606
I think maybe it has something to do with
whatever happened to him in the cave.

175
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,515
Why are you telling me all this?

176
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,150
You found him, Clark.

177
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,585
Just wondering if you could shed
any more light on the situation.

178
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:07,290
I've already told you
everything I know.

179
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,156
These symbols...

180
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,821
...they look like the one on your barn.

181
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,733
Lex, I told you. I don't know
how to read this language.

182
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,907
I believe you, Clark.

183
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,471
Then what am I doing here?

184
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:29,342
I thought, based on our
mutual interest in the cave...

185
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,983
...we could solve this mystery together.

186
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:36,922
I'm sorry, Lex.
I'm as mystified as you are.

187
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,188
I know who you are.

188
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:52,926
Hey, Helen.

189
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:57,361
Are you planning a rehearsal
dinner or a peace summit?

190
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,835
This whole wedding is starting
to feel just as political.

191
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,237
It's hard to know
what side everybody's on.

192
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,107
You're not having
second thoughts, are you?

193
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,579
Sorry, l...

194
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,778
- It's all gotten very complicated.
- Sounds kind of familiar.

195
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:20,787
You wouldn't be talking about a tall,
dark, handsome best man, would you?

196
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:29,062
If you knew that Lex was
keeping secrets from you...

197
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:32,466
...but he was being truthful
about the important things like...

198
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,270
Like the way he feels about you.

199
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,234
Would that be enough?

200
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,705
I guess you have to decide.

201
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:46,978
Is the part of themselves that
they're willing to share with you...

202
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:50,122
...better than not having
them in your life at all?

203
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,440
You don't really think he's
hidden it in here, do you?

204
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:20,946
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm talking about the valuable object...

205
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,315
...Lex stole from your office.

206
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,423
Lex would never steal from me.

207
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:30,789
If you believe that, what are you doing
rummaging around in here while he's out?

208
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,223
How do I know you didn't
break into my office?

209
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:38,098
Oh, my. It seems I've antagonized
the lady of the house.

210
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:42,641
Please, would you tell my son
I dropped by to offer my best wishes?

211
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,207
Oh, no.

212
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,345
That would be difficult,
wouldn't it?

213
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:50,414
Because we'd have to explain
that we ran into each other...

214
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,417
...when we were in here and
I caught you snooping and...

215
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:58,179
Oh, that could get really messy.

216
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,520
Especially with your
wedding day almost upon us.

217
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,358
Get out.

218
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,336
Can I ask you a question, Helen?

219
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,633
Why are you marrying Lex?

220
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,010
Because I love him.

221
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,983
Dr. Walden?

222
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,559
It's me, Clark Kent.

223
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,029
Dr. Walden.

224
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,256
Are you down here?

225
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:53,103
Interesting, isn't it?

226
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,179
- Mr. Luthor.
- That...

227
00:21:56,348 --> 00:22:00,114
...octagonal recess
in the wall, I mean.

228
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:05,747
I once had what you might call
a keepsake that matched this.

229
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,481
Exactly.

230
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,289
Just disappeared from my office.

231
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:17,366
It was that same day you rescued
your mother and me.

232
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,972
What are you doing down here?

233
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,473
I have taken over
conservatorship of the caves.

234
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:28,342
- Didn't Lex tell you?
- No, he didn't.

235
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:33,575
He just doesn't want to admit defeat,
and he's still fighting me on this.

236
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,380
I ran into some of his
security people down here.

237
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:40,514
They were looking for that doctor.
Dr...?

238
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,058
Dr. Walden?

239
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,429
Dr. Walden was obsessed
with these caves.

240
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:47,964
Well, I could understand why.

241
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,760
Look at this.

242
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,369
These symbols...

243
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:56,839
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
They are...

244
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,842
Are they arranged in a different...

245
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,976
...order than they were before?

246
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,646
That's strange.

247
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,287
Don't you think, Clark?

248
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,348
It's all Kawatche to me.

249
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:19,058
If you see Dr. Walden, be careful.

250
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,592
He could be dangerous.

251
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,643
I don't get it.

252
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:36,974
First the refined kryptonite,
now the caves.

253
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,480
What does Luthor want?

254
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:41,017
I don't know, but I think
we have a bigger problem.

255
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:45,452
Dr. Walden can read the Krypton language.
He wrote it on the ceiling at the hospital.

256
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:49,390
- Do you think he's figured out your secret?
- Is that why you're so worried now?

257
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:52,121
I'm not sure, but something's
going on in that cave.

258
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:54,163
The symbols have changed.

259
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:58,831
- What does it say now, son?
- "The day is coming...

260
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,735
...when the last son will begin
his quest to rule the third planet."

261
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,739
- Clark.
- Don't you see? I'm the last son.

262
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:14,311
Why humiliate yourself
like this, Dad?

263
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:17,182
When are you gonna accept
the fact that you're not invited?

264
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:21,986
You know, Lex, I'm not here to grovel
for a place at your table.

265
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:24,652
I wanted to tell you that...

266
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:30,594
...your restraining order to keep me out of
the Kawatche caves has been rejected.

267
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,566
Flat out.

268
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:37,103
And you couldn't have had your lawyers
tell my lawyers that over the phone?

269
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,474
It's curious, though...

270
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:43,581
...your renewed interest seems to come
right on the heels of Dr. Walden's escape.

271
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,877
And Clark Kent seems
to share your opinion.

272
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:52,683
He was down there too,
looking for your linguist.

273
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,422
Lex!

274
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,290
- I did it, Lex.
- Dr. Walden.

275
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,025
I finally read the wall.

276
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,367
I know what it says.

277
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,336
We'll talk all about it,
but first we need to get you help.

278
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,703
- Let the man tell us.
- Stay out of this.

279
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,868
The wall, doctor,
what does it say?

280
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,906
"The last son will rule the planet."

281
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,377
Don't you see?

282
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,614
It's Clark Kent!

283
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,418
- I think that's a pretty big leap.
- No.

284
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:32,621
I've never seen
more clearly in my life.

285
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:37,491
- I know exactly what has to be done.
- What is that, doctor?

286
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,707
We have to kill Clark Kent.

287
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,165
Before he destroys us all.

288
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,309
Dr. Walden, you're confused.

289
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:13,796
"Dear guests..."

290
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,973
No, it's gotta be something else.

291
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,844
"Friend..."
"Friends and family..."

292
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:21,639
First line's always the hardest.

293
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:25,582
- Hey, Chloe, what's up?
- Big news.

294
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,480
Your friend Dr. Walden woke up.

295
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:31,152
I wouldn't exactly call him
a friend of mine.

296
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:36,193
I was just wondering if you wanted to come
out of retirement and do the story with me.

297
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:39,621
Hey, I appreciate the offer,
but now really isn't a good time.

298
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,632
I didn't mean right this second, Clark.

299
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,672
I wish things could be like they were.

300
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,471
Yeah, me too.

301
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:55,907
I just feel like there's this
huge rift between us...

302
00:26:56,082 --> 00:26:59,677
...and no matter how hard I try,
I can't get back to you.

303
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,345
We'll get there, Chloe.
It's just gonna take a little bit of time.

304
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,653
Well, whatever happens,
let's just...

305
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:10,318
Let's promise to be
honest with each other.

306
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:15,297
I mean, you're a big boy, I'm a big girl.
I think we can handle it.

307
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,367
As long as we tell the truth.

308
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:22,968
Okay, well, I'd better get going.

309
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:27,670
You have your rehearsal dinner,
and I have the Torch. So...

310
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,780
Break a leg, Clark.

311
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:05,049
Sorry I'm late.

312
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:08,516
- Where have you been?
- Business crisis.

313
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,279
Don't worry, I'm all yours now.

314
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:13,186
I need a moment
with the best man.

315
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:15,422
Okay.

316
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:19,822
- Hello, Mrs. Kent.
- Everything is beautiful.

317
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:21,591
Thank you. Thank you very much.

318
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,428
- Hello, Lex.
- Hey.

319
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:27,299
- Mind if I have a word with your son?
- No, go right ahead.

320
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:33,107
- Is everything all right?
- Dr. Walden paid me a visit.

321
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,774
Nobody was hurt.

322
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:38,439
He's on his way back to the hospital.

323
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:41,916
- Well, that's good news.
- Clark, he was ranting about you.

324
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:47,616
- What'd he say?
- That the writing on the cave wall says...

325
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:49,385
...you're going to rule the world.

326
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,655
I'm gonna rule the world?

327
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:54,356
- He's obviously nuts.
- Of course he is.

328
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:57,400
Unfortunately, my father was there.
He heard the whole thing.

329
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,629
He didn't believe him, did he?

330
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:03,238
He quoted one of his
favorite Elizabethan poets.

331
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:07,505
Twixt truth and madness lies
But a sliver of a stream

332
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:10,947
He's not just gonna let this drop.

333
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:12,978
I thought I'd warn you.

334
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:26,125
I certainly do admire
your work ethic, Miss Sullivan.

335
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,330
- Late at night, here you are, still at it.
- Yeah.

336
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:35,167
Well, I wasn't invited
to the rehearsal dinner, so...

337
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:38,242
Yes, we have a lot in common.

338
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:43,975
I spoke to the managing editor
of the Daily Planet. It's all set.

339
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:49,918
A weekly column on current affairs
from the young person's perspective.

340
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,319
I don't know how to thank you.

341
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:59,560
Nurturing a promising
young talent is a reward in itself.

342
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:01,893
And I've got your first assignment.

343
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:08,201
A complete investigative
profile of Clark Kent.

344
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:13,874
What possible interest could the Daily
Planet have in a farm boy from Smallville?

345
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:18,482
This isn't for the Daily Planet. They'll
be in touch with you. No, this is for me.

346
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:23,849
Just combine it with any research
about his family you already have.

347
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:35,524
I blew off my journalistic skepticism...

348
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:40,764
...and allowed myself to actually believe
that you were interested in just helping me.

349
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:45,838
You're playing in the real world now,
Miss Sullivan.

350
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,878
You have to give to get.

351
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:54,076
Mr. Luthor. I don't know
what your interest is in Clark...

352
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:58,849
...but you can take the job offer and shove
it down your thousand-dollar pants.

353
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:03,820
Clark's very lucky
to have a friend like you.

354
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:06,294
All that integrity.

355
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:17,036
I wonder, though, if he had to make
a choice, would he sacrifice his dream...

356
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,200
...out of loyalty to you?

357
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:40,458
Any change?

358
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,994
No, he'll be out for hours.

359
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:04,818
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

360
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:10,388
I think Lex picked me to be
the best man because he knew...

361
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:13,998
...how comfortable I was
speaking in front of people.

362
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:21,964
I've been looking through every book
from Socrates to Shakespeare...

363
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:24,905
...trying to find someone
who can put into words the way...

364
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:28,069
...Lex and Helen
feel about each other.

365
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:31,178
But what I realized is,
there are no words for it.

366
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:35,484
That when you have it,
you trust it.

367
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:37,845
You believe in it.

368
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:40,723
Take a chance on it.

369
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:46,325
You're willing to sacrifice
anything to keep it.

370
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:48,690
No matter what the cost.

371
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,568
- To Helen and Lex.
- To Helen and Lex.

372
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:07,418
Thanks.

373
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:15,125
- Clark, are you all right?
- Yeah...

374
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:18,094
...I just gotta get some air.

375
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,399
- Clark.
- Son.

376
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:33,306
- What's the matter?
- It's the key.

377
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:36,346
There's something wrong at home.
I have to go.

378
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,963
I came looking for you.

379
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,739
And I found the proof.

380
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:07,905
You...

381
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,737
...are the one.

382
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:12,049
Dr. Walden, listen to me.

383
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:15,311
- You need help.
- No.

384
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:16,954
You need to die.

385
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,677
Dr. Walden...

386
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,511
Dr. Walden, no!

387
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:13,912
- Doctor, you're making a mistake.
- No, I'm not. I'm doing this for mankind.

388
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:51,308
With the exception of Clark's migraine...

389
00:35:51,484 --> 00:35:54,681
...I thought the evening
was mercifully uneventful.

390
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:03,190
What's wrong?

391
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,296
Nothing.

392
00:36:06,799 --> 00:36:12,795
If we're gonna spend our lives together,
we need to be honest with each other.

393
00:36:12,972 --> 00:36:15,440
You're always saying that.

394
00:36:20,713 --> 00:36:23,944
I found a file on Mrs. Kent
in your bookshelf.

395
00:36:24,116 --> 00:36:27,051
It contained confidential
medical records.

396
00:36:27,987 --> 00:36:29,614
From my office.

397
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:34,888
I got that from a Disease Control agent
who was investigating Mrs. Kent's case.

398
00:36:35,061 --> 00:36:36,756
You mean you bribed someone for it.

399
00:36:38,397 --> 00:36:40,297
I've told you...

400
00:36:40,466 --> 00:36:45,529
...the Kents are very important to me.
I was concerned about Martha's health.

401
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:53,777
- What were you looking for, anyway?
- Something that was stolen from my office.

402
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,144
Do you think I was involved
in the break-in?

403
00:36:58,718 --> 00:37:00,447
Please tell me you weren't.

404
00:37:05,124 --> 00:37:09,584
If you really believe I'm capable
of that kind of deceit...

405
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:13,663
...maybe you
shouldn't be marrying me.

406
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:19,436
Maybe you're right.

407
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:34,279
I had to pry it from his hand.

408
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:36,914
It wasn't your fault, Clark.

409
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:39,516
The man tried to kill you.
He was delusional.

410
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:44,713
Even the sheriff agreed, son.
Walden was responsible for his own death.

411
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,955
What if he was right?

412
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:52,287
- What if I am a threat to mankind?
- I'll never believe that.

413
00:38:52,464 --> 00:38:53,863
And neither should you.

414
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:58,865
And what does it mean? The day is coming
when I'll begin my quest to rule?

415
00:38:59,038 --> 00:39:00,972
We don't know, son.

416
00:39:01,574 --> 00:39:03,701
But when and if that day does come...

417
00:39:03,876 --> 00:39:07,937
...your mother and I both know
that you'll do the right thing.

418
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:17,516
His entire body's been burned
beyond recognition.

419
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,115
But look.

420
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:26,888
Whatever he was holding here,
it protected the skin it was covering.

421
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:32,604
I've never seen anything like this.

422
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:42,272
Send it to me.

423
00:39:44,817 --> 00:39:47,115
Send you what?

424
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:51,480
The hand.

425
00:40:07,206 --> 00:40:10,664
I never got a chance to tell you
how beautiful you look tonight.

426
00:40:11,143 --> 00:40:13,338
Clark, you scared me.

427
00:40:14,113 --> 00:40:16,138
Surprised me.

428
00:40:17,283 --> 00:40:20,878
Just wanted to see you.
Kind of ran out on dinner.

429
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:26,957
I thought your toast
was really beautiful.

430
00:40:30,396 --> 00:40:32,990
I had a lot of inspiration.

431
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:39,201
Sorry I've been so confused about us.

432
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:41,697
It's just...

433
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:43,902
I'm scared.

434
00:40:45,144 --> 00:40:46,577
So am I.

435
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:49,741
You have so many secrets in your life.

436
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:52,978
I know.

437
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:59,013
I just don't want my feelings
for you to be one of them.

438
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:01,884
Neither do I.

439
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:29,613
Kal-EI, it is time.

440
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:40,890
Kal-EI, it is time.
