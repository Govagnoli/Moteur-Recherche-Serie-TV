0
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:38,365
Ho, ho, ho, Lex.

0
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:40,948
Any reason we couldn't have
met at the mansion?

0
00:00:41,096 --> 00:00:45,876
I don't make house calls.
You wanna utilize my skills,
you come to me.

0
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:50,049
That is, if you really wanna
bring down Jonathan Kent.

0
00:00:51,147 --> 00:00:54,437
Then I'm assuming you have
some kind of grenade to launch at him.

0
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:56,941
Not yet.

0
00:00:58,307 --> 00:00:59,619
But I will.

0
00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:06,650
I'll either find it or create it.

0
00:01:07,722 --> 00:01:10,185
It's the pitfall of being
in the public eye.

0
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,154
See, what's printed
about a man is gospel.

0
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:15,645
Doesn't matter if it's fact or not.

0
00:01:17,432 --> 00:01:19,416
Give me 24 hours.

0
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:25,860
Your old man wouldn't hesitate.

0
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:31,382
Before I go down the path
you're <i>proposing...</i>

0
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,572
...I wanna consider all of my options.

0
00:01:34,853 --> 00:01:39,565
What's the matter, Lex?
Holiday spirit got you all sentimental?

0
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:46,753
My father gets wind that we met...

0
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,156
...you're not gonna make it
to New Year's, Griff.

0
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:03,241
Well, well.

0
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,549
Looks like Santa Claus
came to town after all.

0
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:10,929
- I'm not looking for trouble.
- Come on, man, I ain't playing!

0
00:02:11,103 --> 00:02:13,399
- Give me your keys!
- All right, take it easy.

0
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:14,940
Now!

0
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:17,125
And the watch!

0
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,550
Lana

0
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,355
Breakfast!

0
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:14,171
- Who are you?
- Honey, you promised him.

0
00:03:14,214 --> 00:03:16,997
- Come on.
- I don't remember. What hap...?

0
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:18,471
- Come on, Dad!
- Pancakes.

0
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,128
You promised Alex pancakes.

0
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:22,158
And then you're gonna
go shopping for a tree.

0
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:25,797
- No, don't. Don't complain to me.


0
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:26,916
- Dad. Let's go.

0
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:29,495
You're the one who always wants
to wait until Christmas Eve to get it.

0
00:03:31,313 --> 00:03:34,705
- Lana, you're...
- Alex, come on, let's get you dressed.

0
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:36,381
- Okay.
- What the...?

0
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:39,113
Me and Dad are gonna
get the best tree ever.

0
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,519


0
00:03:57,046 --> 00:03:58,690
What happened?

0
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:01,584
Where am I?

0
00:04:18,012 --> 00:04:19,311
Hello, Lex.

0
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:22,489
Mom?

0
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,355
But you're...
- Am I dead?

0
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:33,320
- No, Lex. You're still very much alive. 

0
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:35,999
Then how is...?

0
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,807
I'm dreaming.

0
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:48,769
It's no dream, Lex. This is your life.

0
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:52,427
But I don't understand. 

0
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:54,616
<i>This...</i>This can't be... This isn't real.

0
00:04:54,623 --> 00:04:59,142
It is real, Lex.
As real as you want it to be.

0
00:04:59,202 --> 00:05:03,110
All of this can be yours,
if you make the right choices.

0
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:06,782
All of this?

0
00:05:07,612 --> 00:05:12,147
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

1
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:23,054
serves you right.
these are for the party.

2
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:24,955
besides, we have
enough politicians

3
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:26,855
with their hands
in the cookie jar.

4
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:29,121
martha...look,
i know you're not sold

5
00:06:29,154 --> 00:06:32,021
on the whole idea
of me running for state senate.

6
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:34,388
"not sold" would be
an understatement.

7
00:06:34,421 --> 00:06:36,922
but it is christmas eve.
see?

8
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:41,855
can we please not talk
about that?

9
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:45,788
please?
come on, please?

10
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,121
please?

11
00:06:47,154 --> 00:06:48,555
hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

12
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:50,088
just one.
you cheater.

13
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:55,855
there.
she's perfect.

14
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:57,488
yes, she is.

15
00:07:04,188 --> 00:07:07,355
it's usually just me and mel
at christmas,

16
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:10,321
lots of tinsel,
and an artificial tree.

17
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:14,855
thank you, clark,
for saving me

18
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:16,688
from anothlastic,
store-bought holiday.

19
00:07:16,722 --> 00:07:18,255
you're welcome.

20
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:30,555
merry christmas, chloe.

21
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:32,154
hi, chloe.

22
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:34,288
clark,
i've got a problem.

23
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:35,855
meet me at <i>the planet.</i>

24
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,154
i need your help.

25
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:46,388
mr. luthor,
can you hear me?

26
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:49,455
mr. luthor, squeeze my hand
if you can hear me.

27
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:02,688
lana:
alexander, hey!

28
00:08:02,722 --> 00:08:05,188
hey,
wait for your father.

29
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:07,154
come on!

30
00:08:12,455 --> 00:08:14,288
try and be back by 6:00

31
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:16,288
so we can make it
to the kents' party.

32
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:19,021
kents?

33
00:08:19,054 --> 00:08:20,755
[ chuckles ]
and this year,

34
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:22,054
try and remember
that we're on a budget.

35
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:24,688
at?

36
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:26,555
w-we have a budget?

37
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:28,255
lex, it's been
seven years

38
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:30,388
since your father cut up
your platinum card.

39
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:32,588
i think it's time to embrace
the middle-class lifestyle.

40
00:08:32,622 --> 00:08:34,355
daddy, daddy,
let's go, let's go.

41
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,889
seven years?

42
00:08:37,622 --> 00:08:38,922
seven years?

43
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:46,021
let me see.

44
00:08:46,054 --> 00:08:48,255
okay, here. you know what?
let me do that, lex.

45
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:49,688
come here.
[ laughs ]

46
00:08:49,722 --> 00:08:51,221
come on.

47
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:54,054
one of these days, you're gonna
figure out how to do this,

48
00:08:54,088 --> 00:08:56,622
and hopefully it's before
your new little girl arrives.

49
00:08:56,655 --> 00:08:59,555
alex, in you go.

50
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:05,455
i'm sorry
about the whole budget thing.

51
00:09:05,488 --> 00:09:07,722
i know
that you only overspend

52
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,188
because you want
the best for us,

53
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:13,121
and that's part
of why i love you so much.

54
00:09:25,688 --> 00:09:29,388
have fun.
[ laughs ]

55
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:12,055
wow!

56
00:10:12,088 --> 00:10:13,621
wow is right,

57
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,855
but lana said --

58
00:10:15,888 --> 00:10:18,355
your mom said --

59
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:19,788
clark?

60
00:10:19,821 --> 00:10:21,755
hey.

61
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,588
oh, you have no idea how happy
i am to see the two of you.

62
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:27,888
are you a father again?

63
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:30,122
uh...

64
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:31,888
no.

65
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:33,921
not yet.

66
00:10:33,955 --> 00:10:35,222
i was just --

67
00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:37,222
uncle clark, uncle clark,
make me fly!

68
00:10:37,255 --> 00:10:38,688
hey!

69
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,688
hey, i missed you,
little guy.

70
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:42,088
come on.
whoosh!

71
00:10:43,788 --> 00:10:46,489
i'm sorry i haven't
been around lately.

72
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,088
things have been crazy
at <i>the planet.</i>

73
00:10:49,122 --> 00:10:51,422
yeah, don't let his "things
have been crazy" line fool you.

74
00:10:51,455 --> 00:10:53,088
he's been promoted.

75
00:10:53,122 --> 00:10:55,188
yeah, now i'm closer to being
a full-fledged reporter.

76
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,788
i've got some
pretty big news, too.

77
00:10:57,821 --> 00:10:58,955
okay.

78
00:10:58,988 --> 00:11:01,322
my book's being published
in january.

79
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:03,788
wow. that's great.

80
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:06,455
yeah, they love the idea
of a luthorcorp expos?

81
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:08,688
complete with an anonymous
tell-all source.

82
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:12,455
thank you so much.

83
00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:14,455
i couldn't have done it
without you, lex.

84
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:17,521
all right,

85
00:11:17,554 --> 00:11:20,055
miss "did i mention my book
is about to be published?"

86
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:22,155
let's get your tree
and get out of here.

87
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:24,188
okay. bye, alex.
bye, lex.

88
00:11:24,222 --> 00:11:25,654
see ya, lex.

89
00:11:25,688 --> 00:11:27,489
see you tonight.

90
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,688
alex: dad!

91
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:34,788
this one's awesome!

92
00:11:49,888 --> 00:11:52,988
what happened?

93
00:11:53,022 --> 00:11:55,122
what's wrong with my son?

94
00:11:55,155 --> 00:11:56,455
nurse: just a minute.

95
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:57,988
where's the doctor?

96
00:11:58,022 --> 00:12:00,255
mr. luthor,
i'm dr. scanlon.

97
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:02,422
what's hpening,
doctor?

98
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,122
your son's been shot.

99
00:12:07,088 --> 00:12:08,955
shot?

100
00:12:08,988 --> 00:12:12,489
fortunately, his life is
no longer in danger.

101
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:16,222
i'm afraid lex is going to be
permanently paralyzed

102
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,755
from the chest down.

103
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:21,654
your son's internal bleeding
created a blood clot

104
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:24,355
that's slowly compressing
his spinal cord.

105
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:27,255
if we could relieve
the pressure, we might --

106
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,621
if?

107
00:12:28,654 --> 00:12:30,489
no.

108
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:34,855
no, we are going to do it,
doctor...

109
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,188
now.

110
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,122
mr. luthor,
lex hasn't stabilized yet.

111
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:39,621
an operation
could kill him.

112
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:44,255
my son is going to walk,
doctor.

113
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:46,955
get me dr. litvack.

114
00:12:46,988 --> 00:12:49,122
chloe: so, then they put me
in charge,

115
00:12:49,155 --> 00:12:51,788
and i've actually gotten
a really great response.

116
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:54,489
i mean, i have doubled
the number of toys for tots

117
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:56,322
 <i>the planet</i> collected
last year.

118
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:58,055
okay,
so what's the problem?

119
00:12:58,088 --> 00:13:00,355
well, the presents
need to be delivered tonight

120
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:02,855
and the teamsters are on strike
on christmas eve.

121
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:05,155
so, instead of calling fedex,
you called me?

122
00:13:05,188 --> 00:13:06,988
i do realize
it's a lot to ask,

123
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:09,821
but, i mean, you do run faster
than a speeding bullet

124
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,022
and i know you don't
want to disappoint

125
00:13:12,055 --> 00:13:14,422
all those underprivileged
children, do you?

126
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:16,255
chloe,
you didn't have to go there.

127
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:17,955
well, you know it's true.

128
00:13:17,988 --> 00:13:20,122
i mean, you'd be helping out
a really great cause,

129
00:13:20,155 --> 00:13:21,888
not to mention
saving my career.

130
00:13:21,921 --> 00:13:23,554
it's just,
i promised lana --

131
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:25,088
i'm sure
she'll understand.

132
00:13:25,122 --> 00:13:26,755
or at least
she'll understand

133
00:13:26,788 --> 00:13:29,422
whatever it is
you make up to tell her.

134
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:30,621
please?

135
00:13:31,988 --> 00:13:33,389
all right.

136
00:13:33,422 --> 00:13:35,654
yay!
i'll deliver a few
on my way to the party.

137
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:38,654
you're my hero.
i knew you'd come through.

138
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:39,821
okay.

139
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:47,788
chloe, this isn't
toys for tots.

140
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:50,222
it's toys "r" us.
how many are there?

141
00:13:50,255 --> 00:13:52,855
uh, a couple thousand,
give or take.

142
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:54,688
now, i mapquested
these addresses.

143
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:57,355
and the sooner you can
get started, the better.

144
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:59,788
here comes santa claus.

145
00:14:43,122 --> 00:14:46,489
you're not santa claus.

146
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:48,888
yes, i am.
i'm, uh...

147
00:14:54,821 --> 00:14:57,255
...i'm the new,
improved model.

148
00:14:57,288 --> 00:15:00,188
liar. you can't be santa.
 <i>he</i> is.

149
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,788
clark:
are you all right?

150
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:26,788
you're a little close
to the edge, aren't you?

151
00:15:26,821 --> 00:15:30,088
makes it easier to jump.

152
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:36,988
yeah, i guess it does,
doesn't it?

153
00:15:40,922 --> 00:15:42,521
mind if i sit?

154
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:44,521
it's a free whatever.

155
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:46,555
you want a drink?

156
00:15:46,588 --> 00:15:49,454
no, thanks.
i'm good.

157
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:54,855
w-why don't you
have a seat?

158
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:57,321
you can always jump later.

159
00:15:57,354 --> 00:15:59,289
yeah,
i guess you're right.

160
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:03,454
after all...

161
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:06,488
it's not like
i've got somewhere to be.

162
00:16:11,955 --> 00:16:14,588
listen, i don't want to
be nosy, but...

163
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:22,855
...i was just wondering,
santa...

164
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:25,289
what are you doing
up here?

165
00:16:25,321 --> 00:16:28,388
i mean,
why are you gonna jump?

166
00:16:32,055 --> 00:16:34,388
give me one good reason
why i shouldn't.

167
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:35,988
you can't, can you?

168
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:41,289
have you had a good look
at the world lately?

169
00:16:43,354 --> 00:16:46,321
it's all take, take, take,
bitch, bitch, bitch.

170
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:52,621
what happened
to christmas?

171
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:56,588
peace on earth?

172
00:16:56,621 --> 00:16:58,955
good will to men?

173
00:16:58,988 --> 00:17:02,222
i'll tell you something.

174
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:10,955
the spirit of christmas
is dead.

175
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:17,255
and it's gonna take
a lot more than santa claus

176
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:18,721
to revive it.

177
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:36,488
increase his liquids

178
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:39,855
and, uh, give him 8 milligrams
of decadron.

179
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:42,888
the only thing you have to give
my son, dr. scanlon,

180
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:45,721
is whatever is medically
necessary to have him moved.

181
00:17:45,755 --> 00:17:47,155
i am having lex airlifted

182
00:17:47,189 --> 00:17:49,122
to the davis clinic
in metropolis

183
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:50,555
for immediate surgery.

184
00:17:50,588 --> 00:17:52,421
their neurosurgeon
is standing by.

185
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:54,655
mr. luthor,
i can't condone this.

186
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:58,788
luckily, doctor,
you don't have to.

187
00:17:58,822 --> 00:18:01,055
listen to me.

188
00:18:01,088 --> 00:18:04,621
you are going to walk, son.

189
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:30,521
mommy, come see.

190
00:18:30,555 --> 00:18:33,354
it's a beauty,
isn't it, dad?

191
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,488
i know
what you're thinking.

192
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:48,388
that you've given in
to your son again,

193
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:50,222
that you're spoiling him?

194
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,755
exactly.

195
00:18:51,788 --> 00:18:54,354
and i can certainly understand
how you reach that conclusion,

196
00:18:54,388 --> 00:18:56,955
but...the thing is...

197
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:00,454
...this tree is for me.

198
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:03,788
i don't know
if i ever told you this,

199
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:07,122
but after my mother died...

200
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:11,688
my father didn't allow christmas
to be celebrated in our house.

201
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:15,621
it was a very bleak,
very lonely time for me.

202
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:20,521
and when i saw this tree

203
00:19:20,555 --> 00:19:23,289
and it was exactly like the ones
i dreamed about

204
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:26,255
all the years
i couldn't have one,

205
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:30,421
somehow it represented
all the christmases i missed.

206
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:38,788
can you understand that?

207
00:19:38,822 --> 00:19:42,321
of course i can, honey.

208
00:19:42,354 --> 00:19:45,688
it's the same thing
that you tell me every year.

209
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:03,055
all right, let me get something
to put on the floor

210
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:04,755
before you get needles
everywhere.

211
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,255
come on, muscles.

212
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,255
do i have to do this
all myself?

213
00:20:13,155 --> 00:20:16,255
hey. what's this?

214
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:21,354
your father's secretary
never does forget us.

215
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,421
no, this is
a corporate gift,

216
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:25,521
not something
from my father.

217
00:20:25,555 --> 00:20:27,721
i don't understand.

218
00:20:27,755 --> 00:20:29,655
lex, you know
that christmas

219
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:32,822
is just another opportunity
for your father to ignore you.

220
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:34,755
it's his way
of reminding you

221
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:36,922
just how disappointed
he is in you

222
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:38,421
for turning your back

223
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:40,855
on what he thinks it means
to be a luthor.

224
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:44,688
but as far
as i'm concerned...

225
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:51,621
...getting shot was the best
thing that ever happened to you.

226
00:20:51,655 --> 00:20:53,555
coming that close
to dying

227
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:56,222
made you realize the things
in your life that are important,

228
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,289
made you the man
that you are today...

229
00:21:00,321 --> 00:21:02,088
the man i married.

230
00:21:08,521 --> 00:21:10,855
man: medevac standing by.
please proceed with patient.

231
00:21:10,888 --> 00:21:12,354
over and out.

232
00:21:12,388 --> 00:21:13,988
man #2: roger that.

233
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,555
santa: now, let me
get this straight.

234
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:19,255
you gave up
your first christmas

235
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:21,655
with the girl
you have loved

236
00:21:21,688 --> 00:21:25,521
since you spied on her
through your telescope

237
00:21:25,555 --> 00:21:30,189
to deliver these?

238
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,621
yeah.

239
00:21:31,655 --> 00:21:34,354
i mean, well,
i wasn't spying on her.

240
00:21:37,855 --> 00:21:39,822
look,
i wasn't the only one.

241
00:21:39,855 --> 00:21:42,655
my friend chloe,
she gave up her plans, too.

242
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:44,721
i mean,
someone had to do it.

243
00:21:44,755 --> 00:21:47,621
otherwise those kids wouldn't
have gotten their presents.

244
00:21:47,655 --> 00:21:49,721
they're the ones
o really need them.

245
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:54,688
so, the two of you decided
to try and play santa claus?

246
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,354
i guess i was wrong.

247
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:04,621
the spirit of christmas
isn't dead, after all.

248
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,122
you sure
you're all right?

249
00:22:14,155 --> 00:22:17,888
i ???

250
00:22:35,255 --> 00:22:37,488
ho, ho, holy cow.

251
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:39,354
merry christmas.

252
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:50,048
we'll begin by collapsing
the left lung,

253
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:52,014
ed by
a left-sided thoracotomy.

254
00:22:52,048 --> 00:22:53,849
merry christmas,
everyone.

255
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:57,148
now, kill the carols.
i'm about to perform a miracle.

256
00:23:00,148 --> 00:23:03,148
the party can officially begin.
the luthors are here.

257
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,415
merry christmas, lana.

258
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,715
merry christmas, clark.

259
00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:08,281
lex, merry christmas.

260
00:23:08,315 --> 00:23:09,448
hey.

261
00:23:22,048 --> 00:23:25,181
lex. just the man
i've been waiting for.

262
00:23:25,215 --> 00:23:27,482
lana,
naeautiful.

263
00:23:27,515 --> 00:23:28,582
thank you.

264
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,348
and just about due,
i might add.

265
00:23:30,382 --> 00:23:32,348
only a few more weeks now,
senator.

266
00:23:32,382 --> 00:23:35,248
martha: merry christmas, lana.
you look so beautiful.

267
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:38,648
lex, merry christmas.
[ chuckles ]

268
00:23:41,382 --> 00:23:44,281
look, i probably shouldn't be
showing you this,

269
00:23:44,315 --> 00:23:47,448
but being a state senator
does have its advantages,

270
00:23:47,482 --> 00:23:50,415
like a little advance notice
from the governor.

271
00:23:59,081 --> 00:24:03,782
lex, i never actually thought
i'd say this.

272
00:24:03,815 --> 00:24:06,648
i couldn't be prouder of you
if you were my own son.

273
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:13,348
mr. kent --
jonathan --

274
00:24:13,382 --> 00:24:15,415
i don't know what to say.

275
00:24:15,448 --> 00:24:18,014
let's tell everybody,
shall we? hmm?

276
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:19,181
come on.

277
00:24:19,215 --> 00:24:21,782
everybody, grab a drink.

278
00:24:21,815 --> 00:24:24,715
come on, grab a glass.
listen up.

279
00:24:24,749 --> 00:24:27,448
here, here, please.
thank you.

280
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:30,582
now, uh...

281
00:24:30,615 --> 00:24:33,448
ladies and gentlemen,
i have it on very good authority

282
00:24:33,482 --> 00:24:36,548
that this year's
kansas humanitarian award

283
00:24:36,582 --> 00:24:40,715
is going to be given
to our very own lex luthor.

284
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:46,782
ladies and gentlemen,
i give you lex luthor,

285
00:24:46,815 --> 00:24:50,248
the finest man i know.

286
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:51,615
cheers!cheers!
cheers!cheers!

287
00:24:56,181 --> 00:25:01,148
lex: i can't remember
ever being this happy.

288
00:25:01,181 --> 00:25:04,081
this has been
the best day of my life.

289
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:06,914
thank you.

290
00:25:06,948 --> 00:25:09,148
it doesn't have to end,
lex.

291
00:25:09,181 --> 00:25:11,648
every day
can be this wonderful.

292
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:14,715
i told you this is the life
you could have,d 

293
00:25:14,749 --> 00:25:16,849
the life
you <i>can</i> have, lex.

294
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:19,048
this is what i want.

295
00:25:19,081 --> 00:25:21,315
what do i have to do?

296
00:25:21,348 --> 00:25:24,148
you just have to make
the right decision, lex.

297
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:26,548
follow your heart,
not your ambition.

298
00:25:26,582 --> 00:25:29,782
what decision?
what are you talking about?

299
00:25:29,815 --> 00:25:34,548
lex...
who are you talking to?

300
00:25:38,515 --> 00:25:43,248
no one...
or possibly myself.

301
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:46,215
i really don't know
anymore.

302
00:25:46,248 --> 00:25:48,715
i guess i'm just feeling
contemplative this evening.

303
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:51,648
yeah, well, the holidays
will do that to you.

304
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:59,382
you know, my life hasn't turned
out at all the way i planned.

305
00:26:01,148 --> 00:26:03,382
and yet,
i've never been happier.

306
00:26:03,415 --> 00:26:05,749
lex, you have
a wonderful life

307
00:26:05,782 --> 00:26:08,081
and every reason
to be happy.

308
00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:12,048
you have a beautiful wife,
great son,

309
00:26:12,081 --> 00:26:14,014
a baby on the way.

310
00:26:14,048 --> 00:26:17,248
something i still
can't quite believe --

311
00:26:17,281 --> 00:26:19,415
me and lana.

312
00:26:19,448 --> 00:26:21,914
now, how the hell
did that happen?

313
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:24,682
well...

314
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:27,548
you became the kind of man
she could love.

315
00:26:27,582 --> 00:26:30,749
you mean the kind of man
you've always been?

316
00:26:34,014 --> 00:26:37,248
and, lex, you offered her
something i didn't.

317
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:41,315
what held you back,
clark?

318
00:26:41,348 --> 00:26:43,382
i mean,
i know you love her --

319
00:26:45,215 --> 00:26:47,181
i don't know.

320
00:26:47,215 --> 00:26:49,382
i guess
i just wasn't ready, lex.

321
00:26:49,415 --> 00:26:51,181
maybe i never will be.

322
00:26:51,215 --> 00:26:55,048
but i am glad that you and lana
ended up together

323
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:58,881
and we've been able to remain
such good friends.

324
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:02,148
thank you.

325
00:27:02,181 --> 00:27:05,448
lex, come quickly.
it's lana.

326
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:13,648
suction.

327
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:16,415
yeah,
i need more suction.

328
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:19,582
and give me
some more exposure.

329
00:27:21,715 --> 00:27:24,081
we're ng him.

330
00:27:24,115 --> 00:27:25,881
come on, people,
get it together.

331
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:32,815
you were great.

332
00:27:37,482 --> 00:27:39,248
merry christmas.

333
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:42,914
you're the parents
of a beautiful baby girl.

334
00:27:45,014 --> 00:27:46,582
wow.

335
00:27:48,315 --> 00:27:50,248
she's perfect.

336
00:27:52,782 --> 00:27:54,749
what an amazing
christmas gift, lana.

337
00:27:54,782 --> 00:27:56,014
thank you.

338
00:27:58,181 --> 00:28:00,615
well,
you did a little bit.

339
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:05,215
hi.
hi, little girl.

340
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,215
you're so beautiful.

341
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:18,315
wow.

342
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:20,115
we did that.

343
00:28:21,782 --> 00:28:23,782
lana, are you okay?

344
00:28:23,815 --> 00:28:25,048
nurse?

345
00:28:25,081 --> 00:28:27,081
hemorrhaging.
we need to start transfusing.

346
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:28,582
what's happening?

347
00:28:28,615 --> 00:28:30,281
someone
get him out of here.

348
00:28:30,315 --> 00:28:31,582
i'm sorry, sir,
you'll have to leave.

349
00:28:31,615 --> 00:28:33,849
lana?

350
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:36,415
nurse, start a drip.

351
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:41,048
let's get her
into the o.r. now.

352
00:28:55,785 --> 00:28:57,151
mr. luthor?

353
00:28:57,185 --> 00:28:58,552
how is she?

354
00:28:58,585 --> 00:29:00,552
i'm sorry, but your wife
has lost a lot of blood.

355
00:29:00,585 --> 00:29:02,318
we're trying to control it,
but --

356
00:29:02,352 --> 00:29:04,752
there's got to be something
you can do.

357
00:29:18,905 --> 00:29:22,439
dad, i --
i, uh, need your help.

358
00:29:22,472 --> 00:29:23,938
i don't doubt it.

359
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,671
why else would you be here
christmas eve?

360
00:29:29,338 --> 00:29:30,771
it's lana, dad.

361
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:33,038
they started transfusions,

362
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:35,771
but we've got to get her
to a specialist.

363
00:29:35,805 --> 00:29:38,771
there's a surgeon in metropolis
at the davis clinic.

364
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:45,638
oh, lex,
what a sorry situation

365
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:48,704
you have gotten
yourself into.

366
00:29:52,638 --> 00:29:56,871
i don't think
you understand.

367
00:29:56,905 --> 00:29:59,805
my wife is dying, and i need
the helijet to save her.

368
00:29:59,838 --> 00:30:02,072
i understand you
perfectly.

369
00:30:02,105 --> 00:30:04,072
you turned your back on me
seven years ago,

370
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:05,704
but now you need my help.

371
00:30:05,738 --> 00:30:07,671
so, now you have no problem
banging on my door,

372
00:30:07,704 --> 00:30:09,704
begging for favors
in the name of family.

373
00:30:09,738 --> 00:30:11,938
i'm talking about lana!

374
00:30:11,971 --> 00:30:14,439
i know we've had
our differences,

375
00:30:14,472 --> 00:30:16,771
but my wife --

376
00:30:16,805 --> 00:30:19,138
she's the mother
of your grandchildren.

377
00:30:20,871 --> 00:30:22,838
how could i
have grandchildren?

378
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:24,771
i don't have a son.

379
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:29,138
you bastard!

380
00:30:31,604 --> 00:30:34,539
you can save her.

381
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:41,505
no, lex.

382
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,472
i'm not gonna do that.

383
00:30:44,505 --> 00:30:47,105
don't you understand
that every decision you've made

384
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:49,072
has brought you
to this very moment,

385
00:30:49,105 --> 00:30:51,405
beginning that day
seven years ago

386
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:52,838
in the hospital

387
00:30:52,871 --> 00:30:55,571
when you decided to fot
the state senate race

388
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,072
to jonathan kent?

389
00:30:58,105 --> 00:31:02,805
i told you
this would happen.

390
00:31:02,838 --> 00:31:06,372
i warned you, but you chose
to give up your family.

391
00:31:06,405 --> 00:31:08,205
and when you made
that decision,

392
00:31:08,238 --> 00:31:10,205
you gave up the money
and the power

393
00:31:10,238 --> 00:31:14,138
that would've enabled you
to save your wife.

394
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,439
pathetic.

395
00:31:32,838 --> 00:31:35,072
you said
you didn't want to be a luthor,

396
00:31:35,105 --> 00:31:37,072
that you wanted instead
to be free

397
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,771
to live
happily ever after.

398
00:31:41,738 --> 00:31:44,005
go on, then, lex.

399
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:51,439
you better get back
to it.

400
00:32:01,172 --> 00:32:05,005
lana...please.

401
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:07,472
don't give up.

402
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:10,138
don't leave me.

403
00:32:14,138 --> 00:32:16,238
lex.

404
00:32:16,272 --> 00:32:19,072
hey.

405
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:28,938
you have to be strong, lex,

406
00:32:28,971 --> 00:32:32,671
for alexander...
for lily.

407
00:32:32,704 --> 00:32:35,472
lana...

408
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:41,372
...i love you.

409
00:32:41,405 --> 00:32:44,871
maybe i tell you that
all the time -- i don't know --

410
00:32:44,905 --> 00:32:47,971
but please listen to me.

411
00:32:48,005 --> 00:32:52,172
i mean it.
i love you.

412
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:56,372
i have always loved you.

413
00:32:56,405 --> 00:33:01,038
i love you, too,
lex luthor.

414
00:33:04,372 --> 00:33:06,671
you're a good man.

415
00:33:10,372 --> 00:33:12,704
don't ever change.

416
00:33:48,972 --> 00:33:51,672
what did you do to her?

417
00:33:51,705 --> 00:33:55,139
why didn't you
stop this?

418
00:33:55,171 --> 00:33:57,605
i thought you were showing me
a better life.

419
00:33:57,638 --> 00:34:00,672
i was, lex. i <i>am.</i>

420
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:04,371
a life
where my wife dies?

421
00:34:04,405 --> 00:34:06,405
a life full of pain?

422
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:08,705
no, lex,
a life full of <i>love.</i>

423
00:34:08,738 --> 00:34:11,139
love?

424
00:34:11,171 --> 00:34:14,371
everyone i've ever loved
has died.

425
00:34:14,405 --> 00:34:19,204
first julian
and then you...

426
00:34:19,238 --> 00:34:22,638
and now lana's dead.

427
00:34:22,672 --> 00:34:25,772
and i couldn't do anything
to stop it.

428
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,872
lex? son...
lana!

429
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:33,772
...i'm here.

430
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:37,171
you're in metropolis, lex,
at the davis clinic.

431
00:34:38,872 --> 00:34:41,838
you've been shot.

432
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:44,538
but you're gonna be
all right.

433
00:35:17,371 --> 00:35:19,705
merry christmas, chloe.

434
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:22,471
santa?

435
00:35:22,504 --> 00:35:25,905
suit gave me away, huh?
[ chuckles ]

436
00:35:27,438 --> 00:35:29,872
uh, what, uh, what --
what do you want?

437
00:35:29,905 --> 00:35:32,404
i met a friend of yours --
young clark kent.

438
00:35:32,438 --> 00:35:34,339
he told me
what you two were doing,

439
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:37,705
how you were giving up
your respective christmas eves.

440
00:35:37,738 --> 00:35:40,038
i figured you could use
a little help.

441
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:41,838
shouldn't you be,
you know,

442
00:35:41,872 --> 00:35:44,105
standing on a street corner
with a bell?

443
00:35:44,138 --> 00:35:46,038
[ laughs ] come on.

444
00:35:46,072 --> 00:35:47,838
let me give you two a hand,

445
00:35:47,872 --> 00:35:50,471
take a little bit
of the pressure off.

446
00:35:50,504 --> 00:35:53,072
i am familiar with the job,
you know.

447
00:35:54,272 --> 00:35:57,339
i don't know.

448
00:35:57,371 --> 00:35:59,105
give me a chance.

449
00:35:59,138 --> 00:36:01,605
worst-case scenario --

450
00:36:01,638 --> 00:36:05,038
i make off
with a few free squirt guns.

451
00:36:07,905 --> 00:36:10,638
well, we definitely could use
all the help we can get.

452
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:13,538
and at least no one's gonna
accuse you of being a scab

453
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,138
in a santa outfit.

454
00:36:16,838 --> 00:36:18,239
all right, um,

455
00:36:18,272 --> 00:36:20,738
i've organized the addresses
from east to west,

456
00:36:20,771 --> 00:36:22,272
so if you just...

457
00:36:42,738 --> 00:36:46,272
lex, you wanted to talk
to me?

458
00:36:49,404 --> 00:36:53,038
whatever it is, son, it can wait
till you're stronger.

459
00:36:53,072 --> 00:36:56,671
you're right.

460
00:36:56,705 --> 00:36:59,404
i should probably
be resting.

461
00:36:59,438 --> 00:37:00,972
after all,

462
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:04,671
i did just undergo
a life-threatening operation.

463
00:37:16,738 --> 00:37:18,972
dr. litvack told me
the odds of survival

464
00:37:19,005 --> 00:37:20,905
i had going into surgery.

465
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:27,438
pretty reckless roll
of the dice, don't you think?

466
00:37:27,471 --> 00:37:29,172
on the contrary, son.

467
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,805
what i did
may appear callous,

468
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:34,905
but opting for my son
to have surgery

469
00:37:34,938 --> 00:37:36,972
was a deliberate decision.

470
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,239
but it wasn't your decision
to make, was it?

471
00:37:41,172 --> 00:37:43,138
you went against
the doctors' advice

472
00:37:43,172 --> 00:37:47,105
not because
you wanted to save me,

473
00:37:47,138 --> 00:37:51,239
but because you couldn't bear
having a cripple for a son.

474
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:57,272
you may hate me
for taking the risk,

475
00:37:57,305 --> 00:37:59,038
but i had to make
a choice.

476
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:05,404
and you're alive...

477
00:38:05,438 --> 00:38:07,072
and you can walk.

478
00:38:07,105 --> 00:38:09,072
i had to give you
that chance.

479
00:38:09,105 --> 00:38:13,305
and what if
i hadn't made it?

480
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:16,105
how would you have justified
your decision then?

481
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:26,872
how dare you play god
with my life.

482
00:38:34,305 --> 00:38:35,972
hey, hey, no!

483
00:38:36,005 --> 00:38:38,504
come on, come on.
outside.

484
00:38:38,538 --> 00:38:39,972
mel.

485
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:41,705
the dog.

486
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:47,938
chloe: so, then
i turn back around

487
00:38:47,972 --> 00:38:50,172
and your tubby,
little miscreant is gone

488
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:52,605
along with all the toys.

489
00:38:52,638 --> 00:38:53,872
yeah, right.

490
00:38:53,905 --> 00:38:55,771
the same guy,
the drunk santa,

491
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:57,905
the guy who i just talked off
the roof of a building.

492
00:38:57,938 --> 00:38:59,838
yes, honestly, clark.

493
00:38:59,872 --> 00:39:02,972
i'm sure that i was tired enough
to have imagined santa,

494
00:39:03,005 --> 00:39:05,538
but there is no way
i could've dreamed away

495
00:39:05,571 --> 00:39:08,504
all of those wiffle balls
and game boys.

496
00:39:08,538 --> 00:39:10,905
maybe he really is...

497
00:39:10,938 --> 00:39:12,239
yeah, right.

498
00:39:12,272 --> 00:39:15,872
come on, clark,
there's a chance.

499
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:19,805
martha: look, everybody,
it's snowing.

500
00:39:21,272 --> 00:39:23,738
oh, we are gonna have
a white christmas.

501
00:39:28,072 --> 00:39:30,205
[ laughing ]
hey!

502
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:36,404
merry christmas, lana.

503
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:38,972
merry <i>first</i> christmas
together, clark --

504
00:39:39,005 --> 00:39:40,905
first of many.

505
00:39:47,538 --> 00:39:51,239
i thought you didn't make
house calls.

506
00:39:53,272 --> 00:39:56,172
given the circumstances,
i made an exception.

507
00:39:58,339 --> 00:40:00,404
oh, not to worry, griff.

508
00:40:00,438 --> 00:40:03,605
we luthors are made
of pretty tough

509
00:40:03,638 --> 00:40:06,705
and definitely expensive
material.

510
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,905
you sure your morphine drip
isn't turned up too high?

511
00:40:09,938 --> 00:40:13,671
it's not every day that one has
a near-death experience.

512
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:17,172
and it's true.

513
00:40:17,205 --> 00:40:19,371
much like ebenezer scrooge,

514
00:40:19,404 --> 00:40:23,938
i realized that what i want
more than anything...

515
00:40:23,972 --> 00:40:26,805
is to live
happily ever after.

516
00:40:34,038 --> 00:40:36,005
and do you know
what the secret

517
00:40:36,038 --> 00:40:38,038
to living
happily ever after is?

518
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:43,738
power.

519
00:40:43,771 --> 00:40:47,105
money and power.

520
00:40:48,805 --> 00:40:51,305
see, once you have
those two things,

521
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:53,471
you can secure
everything else...

522
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:58,371
and keep it that way.

523
00:40:58,404 --> 00:41:01,705
so, what am i
doing here, lex?

524
00:41:07,438 --> 00:41:10,404
i want you to pull the pin
on that grenade.

525
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:16,272
find it, fake it...

526
00:41:16,305 --> 00:41:18,339
do whatever it takes

527
00:41:18,371 --> 00:41:22,438
to knock jonathan kent
out of the race.

528
00:41:22,471 --> 00:41:25,205
i want to be senator.

529
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:30,705
i want it all.

530
00:41:33,005 --> 00:41:34,671
consider it done.

531
00:41:38,138 --> 00:41:39,538
merry christmas.
