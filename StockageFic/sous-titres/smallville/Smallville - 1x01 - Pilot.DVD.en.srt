1
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,838
This has got to stop.
Open your eyes, Lex!

2
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,241
I can't!

3
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,813
Luthors are not afraid!

4
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,817
We don't have that luxury.
We're leaders.

5
00:00:56,456 --> 00:01:01,826
You have a destiny. You'll never
get anywhere with your eyes closed.

6
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,232
Abracadabra.

7
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,338
- Afternoon, Nell.
- Jonathan!

8
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,340
Martha. What a surprise.

9
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,080
What brings the reclusive
Kents to town?

10
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:24,873
Tulips. Red ones, if you have them.

11
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,915
What about a tiger orchid?

12
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,385
No, thanks. Martha has
her heart set on tulips.

13
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,951
Yes, well, they are a very
uncomplicated flower.

14
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,927
That's a beautiful dress, Lana!
Are you a princess?

15
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,136
- I'm a fairy princess.
- Where are her parents?

16
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,466
They're at the homecoming game.
I'm being the good aunt.

17
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,539
Do you want to make a wish?

18
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,210
I would love to make a wish.

19
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,812
Abracadabra.

20
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,787
I know what you wished for.

21
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:16,601
I see a little face.
It's all I ever wanted.

22
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,977
Hey, looks like Smallville won again.

23
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,439
Lex? Son?

24
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:58,508
Now, where do I sign?

25
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,372
Right here, Mr. Luthor.

26
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,025
- Help me.
- Huh?

27
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,889
Help me, please.

28
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,193
Hey, kid...

29
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,696
Help me.

30
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,828
Help me, please.

31
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,203
What on God's Earth...?

32
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,276
Hi, Lana!

33
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,137
Mommy! Daddy!

34
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,335
What's happening, Jonathan?

35
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:56,850
Lex! Lex! Where are you?

36
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,009
Lex? Lex?

37
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,697
Martha?

38
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,824
Kids don't just fall out
of the sky, Martha.

39
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:47,430
- Then where did he come from?
- I don't know.

40
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,464
But he must have parents.

41
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:57,836
If he does, they're
definitely not from Kansas.

42
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,079
Sweetheart, we can't keep him.

43
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:11,017
What'll we say?
We found him in a field?

44
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,123
We didn't find him.

45
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,420
He found us.

46
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,059
Clark, you're gonna be late!

47
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,562
Coming, Mom.

48
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,405
- Ah, ah!
- It tastes better from the bottle.

49
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,736
- Where'd you learn your manners?
- On a farm.

50
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,174
Afternoon, sleepyhead.

51
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,750
I have class tonight so you two are
on your own. And no pizza!

52
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,190
There's food in the fridge.

53
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,391
Hey, what you got there, son?

54
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:22,924
Permission slip.

55
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:28,757
It's for the football team. They're
having tryouts this afternoon.

56
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,198
- You played football, Dad.
- That was different.

57
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,597
- Why?
- You know why.

58
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,700
I'll run at half speed-

59
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,902
Lot of things can happen
in the heat of the game.

60
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,071
Most new guys hardly even play.

61
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:49,085
Chances are I'll ride the bench
half the season. I can be careful.

62
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,953
I know you can be careful,
but what if there's an accident?

63
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:07,268
Look, Clark, I know this has gotta
be really hard for you...

64
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:10,407
...but hang in there like we promised.

65
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,470
I'm sick of hanging in there.

66
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:16,237
All I wanna do is go through high school
without being a total loser.

67
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,167
I can't believe you bet against him.

68
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:48,379
If the clock moved
any slower, he'd be extinct.

69
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,075
Did you hear that?

70
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,790
- So did anyone ask you to the dance?
- Not yet.

71
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,493
If nothing pans out, maybe you...

72
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:42,831
Take a break from your soap opera.
I'm not interested in Clark.

73
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,232
Your vehement denial has
been duly noted.

74
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,635
Maybe you and I could go.

75
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,073
Not as a date thing,
more of a friend thing.

76
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,871
Hi, guys.

77
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,878
Didn't you just-?
Weren't you-?

78
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:02,018
- I took a shortcut.
- Through a black hole?

79
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:08,457
You'll have to excuse our reporter.
Her "weirdar" is on Defcon 5.

80
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,924
She thought the bus was attacked.

81
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,123
Just because everyone ignores
the strange things that go on...

82
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,631
...doesn't mean they don't happen.

83
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,000
We'd love to join you and
Scooby for another zany adventure...

84
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,766
...but we need to hand in these
slips before homeroom.

85
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:30,481
I'm having second thoughts.
I don't think it's a good idea.

86
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,183
This is the only way.

87
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:36,148
Wait. You two are trying
out for the football team?

88
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:40,119
What is this, some
sort of teen suicide pact?

89
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,823
We're trying to avoid
being a scarecrow.

90
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,861
What are you talking about,
and why the whispering?

91
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:53,231
It's tradition. Before the game,
the players pick a freshman...

92
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,565
...take him and paint
an S on his chest.

93
00:12:56,876 --> 00:13:01,006
- String him up like a scarecrow.
- Sounds like years of therapy.

94
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,078
That's why we're trying out.

95
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,840
They won't choose one of their own.

96
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,925
- I'll see you guys in class.
- Bye.

97
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,894
- Give him 10 seconds.
- Five.

98
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:26,264
One, two, three, four, five.

99
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,773
Statistical fact.

100
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,773
He can't get within 5 feet
of Lana Lang...

101
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,411
...without turning into
a freak show.

102
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,614
Nietzsche.

103
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,587
Didn't realize you had
a dark side, Clark.

104
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,055
- Doesn't everybody?
- Yeah, I guess so.

105
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,759
So, what are you, man or superman?

106
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:01,302
- Haven't figured it out yet.
- Lana. There you are.

107
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,538
Hey, Clark.

108
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,111
I was wondering if you
could do me a favor.

109
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:14,580
Could you check my English paper?
I didn't finish until 2 a. m.

110
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:18,948
- I'm not sure about the ending.
- I'll bet it's great.

111
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,957
Dude. Are you feeling all right?

112
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:29,600
- You look like you're about to hurl.
- I'm fine.

113
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,905
You forgot one, Clark.

114
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,624
Payback time.

115
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,062
Thanks, Dad.

116
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:49,809
Ready! Down! Set! Hike!

117
00:15:56,555 --> 00:16:02,687
<i>Red and gold no doubt
We're here to win one out</i>

118
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,971
I knew you could do it, Clark.

119
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:05,287
<i>Clark, Clark, Clark...</i>

120
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,492
Clark! How do I look?

121
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,524
Like a tackle dummy.

122
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,431
Good luck.

123
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,627
Come on, don't die on me!

124
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,607
I could've sworn I hit you.

125
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,678
If you did, I'd be...

126
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,479
I'd be dead.

127
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,430
Clark!

128
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,906
- Son, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

129
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,600
- Who's the maniac driving the car?
- That would be me.

130
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,504
Lex Luthor.

131
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,016
I'm Jonathan Kent. This is my son.

132
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,016
Thanks for saving my life.

133
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,051
I'm sure you'd have done the same.

134
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:58,062
You have an extraordinary boy.
If there's any way I can repay you-

135
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,595
You could drive slower.

136
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,674
My aunt'll be back any minute.

137
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,818
Oh, come on!
We're living on the edge.

138
00:20:56,088 --> 00:21:00,582
If Aunt Nell finds us here,
your life won't be worth living.

139
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:04,990
- Where is she anyway, bridge club?
- Lex Luthor's.

140
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,524
I didn't know your aunt was in
with the Luthors.

141
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,292
She sold them a ton of land.

142
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,905
They own the Metropolis Sharks.
She could put in a good word.

143
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:17,132
If you want a good word, ask Clark.

144
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:21,501
- He saved Lex's life today.
- You're kidding.

145
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:25,305
Sometimes people can surprise you.

146
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,485
I think it's kind of cool.

147
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:33,355
Coach said a scout from Kansas State
is coming to the game on Saturday.

148
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,887
That's great.

149
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,689
I don't want to be a "Remember him?"

150
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,525
Smallville's got enough of those guys.

151
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:50,103
I want you to wear this to the game.

152
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,841
I can't take this.

153
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,606
You can give it back after you win.

154
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:02,009
Is it really made from a piece
of the meteor that, you know...?

155
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:06,055
So much bad luck came out of it...

156
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,758
...there can only be good luck left.

157
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,986
Jeez, kid! Scared the crap out of me.

158
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,601
Don't I know you?

159
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:03,080
You look like that scarecrow kid.
Where the hell you been?

160
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,141
Hey, freakazoid, wake up.

161
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:21,622
That was 12 years ago, man.
That was just a game.

162
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,966
What do you want?

163
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,703
To play.

164
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:50,056
- Hey, Mom, whose truck?
- Yours.

165
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,186
It's a gift from Lex Luthor.

166
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:03,130
"Dear Clark: Drive safely.
Always in your debt...

167
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,037
...the maniac in the Porsche. "

168
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,905
I don't believe it.
Where are the keys?

169
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,411
Your father has them.

170
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:30,994
I know how much you want it, son,
but you can't keep it.

171
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:35,401
- Why not? I saved his life.
- So you deserve a prize?

172
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,971
That's not what I meant.

173
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,944
How about you drive it,
and I'll drive the old one?

174
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:46,310
- Everybody wins.
- It's not about winning, Clark.

175
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:52,154
It's not like the Luthors
can't afford it.

176
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,386
Do you know why that is?

177
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,994
Remember Mr. Bell?
We'd fish on his property.

178
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:02,256
Mr. Guy? He sent us
pumpkins on Halloween.

179
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,964
Lionel Luthor promised to cut
them in on a deal.

180
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,604
He sent them flashy gifts.

181
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:12,273
Once they sold him their property,
he went back on his word.

182
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:13,739
He had them evicted.

183
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,314
You're judging Lex
on what his father did?

184
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,482
No, Clark, I'm not.

185
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,954
I want to make sure you know...

186
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:27,089
...where the money came from
that bought that truck.

187
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:37,501
Clark, I know you're upset, son,
but it's normal.

188
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,100
Normal?

189
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,842
How about this?
Is this normal?

190
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:57,521
I didn't dive in after Lex's car.
It hit me at 60 mph.

191
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:03,019
Does that sound normal to you?
I'd give anything to be normal.

192
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,379
It's time, son.

193
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,492
Time for what?

194
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,488
The truth.

195
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:46,131
I want you to take a look
at something.

196
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:53,033
I think it's from your parents.
Your real parents.

197
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,249
What does it say?

198
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:04,445
I tried to decipher it for years,
but it's not a language known to man.

199
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,084
What do you mean?

200
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:13,758
Your real parents weren't exactly
from around here.

201
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,956
Where are they from?

202
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:29,808
What are you trying to tell me?
I'm from another planet?

203
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:37,118
I suppose you stashed
my spaceship in the attic.

204
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,785
Actually, it's in the cellar.

205
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,296
This is how you came
into our world, son.

206
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,967
It was the day of the meteor shower.

207
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,962
This is a joke, right?

208
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,483
Why didn't you tell
me about this before?

209
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,746
- We wanted to protect you.
- Protect me from what?

210
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,854
You should have told me.

211
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,789
Clark. Clark!

212
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,979
- Who's there?
- It's me.

213
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,915
Clark.

214
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,046
Clark Kent?

215
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,255
What are you doing
creeping around the woods?

216
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,049
You'd never believe me if I told you.

217
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,689
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

218
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,094
Clark, wait.

219
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:59,668
Just wasn't expecting
to see anyone out here.

220
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,100
Are you okay?

221
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,773
I'm hanging out in a graveyard.
Does that strike you as okay behavior?

222
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:10,208
Hey, I'm here too.

223
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,883
Good point. What's your story?

224
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:22,019
Can you keep a secret?

225
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,390
I'm the Fort Knox of secrets.

226
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,563
I...

227
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:32,861
...came out here
to talk with my parents.

228
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:39,868
You must think I'm pretty weird,
conversing with dead people.

229
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:44,177
I don't think you're weird, Lana.

230
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,445
Do you remember them?

231
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,081
They died when I was 3.

232
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,551
I'm sorry.

233
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,883
It's not your fault, Clark.

234
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:59,595
Come on, I'll introduce you.

235
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,925
Mom, Dad?

236
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,468
This is Clark Kent.

237
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,903
Say hi.

238
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,836
Hi.

239
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,207
Yeah, he is kind of shy.

240
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,441
How should I know?

241
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,220
Mom asks if you're upset about a girl.

242
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:31,952
- Dad asks if it's about a guy.
- No, no.

243
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,496
He has a twisted sense of humor.

244
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,130
Seriously, Clark.

245
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,301
Why are you out here?

246
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:49,310
Ever feel like your life was
supposed to be something different?

247
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:56,582
Sometimes I dream I'm at school,
waiting for Nell to pick me up.

248
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,413
But she doesn't come.

249
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,389
My parents drive up and they're
not dead, they're just really late.

250
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:09,534
I get in their car and we drive back
to my real life in Metropolis.

251
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,668
That's when I wake up.

252
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:17,232
And for a minute, I'm totally happy.

253
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:21,201
Until I realize I'm still alone.

254
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,810
What's that, Mrs. Lang?

255
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,619
Yeah, I'll tell her.

256
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:39,128
Your mom wants you to know
you're never alone.

257
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:44,361
That she's always looking over you.
No matter what.

258
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,667
What's that, Mr. Lang?

259
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:55,277
Your dad thinks you're a shoo-in
for homecoming queen.

260
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,777
They really say all that?

261
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:06,449
Oh, they're quite chatty
once you get them started.

262
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,297
Thanks for walking me home.

263
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,729
Beats creeping around the woods.

264
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:22,536
You realize this is the longest
conversation we've ever had?

265
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,042
We should do it again.

266
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,574
Yes, we should.

267
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,073
So are you going to the dance?

268
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,342
Yeah, with Whitney.

269
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,180
Right, of course.

270
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,421
How about you?

271
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,256
No, figured I'd sit it out.

272
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,730
If you change your mind...

273
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,730
...I might save you a dance.

274
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,834
Good night, Clark.

275
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,297
Hello?

276
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,471
Hello?

277
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,727
Clark?

278
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,122
I didn't see you.

279
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,226
I buzzed, but no one answered.

280
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,197
How'd you get through the gate?

281
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,738
Squeezed through the bars.
If this is a bad time-

282
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:09,141
No, I think Heiki has sufficiently
kicked my ass for the day.

283
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,177
This is a great place.

284
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:16,685
- If you're dead and need it to haunt.
- I meant it's roomy.

285
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,787
It's the Luthor ancestral home.

286
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:23,984
So my father claims. He had it
shipped over from Scotland.

287
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:28,426
I remember trucks rolled in
for weeks. No one ever moved in.

288
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:32,296
My father had no intention of living here.
He's never been here.

289
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,801
- Then why ship it over?
- Because he could.

290
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,574
How's the new ride?

291
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,904
That's why I'm here.

292
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:45,138
What's the matter?
You don't like it?

293
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:48,477
No, it's not that.
I can't keep it.

294
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:54,321
Clark, you saved my life.
It's the least I can do.

295
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,021
Your father doesn't like me.

296
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:03,527
It's okay. I've been
bald since I was 9.

297
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:07,397
- I'm used to people judging me.
- It's not personal.

298
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,267
He's just not crazy
about your dad.

299
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:14,209
Figures the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree?

300
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,073
Understandable.

301
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,075
What about you, Clark?

302
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,008
Did you fall far from the tree?

303
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:30,359
I'd better go.
Thanks for the truck.

304
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:33,624
Clark?

305
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,230
Do you believe a man can fly?

306
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,466
Sure, in a plane.

307
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,706
I'm not talking about that.

308
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,708
I'm talking about soaring
with nothing but air beneath you.

309
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:50,973
- People can't fly, Lex.
- I did.

310
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:55,715
After the accident,
when my heart stopped.

311
00:35:55,987 --> 00:36:01,254
It was the most exhilarating
two minutes of my life.

312
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,954
I flew over Smallville.

313
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,062
And for the first time...

314
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,064
...I didn't see a dead end.

315
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,161
I saw a new beginning.

316
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:20,608
Thanks to you,
I have a second chance.

317
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,644
We are the future, Clark.

318
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:29,246
I don't want anything to stand in
the way of our friendship.

319
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:42,957
- That's the third guy.
- And they're all former jocks.

320
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,633
- Who's the weirdo?
- I don't know.

321
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,864
Let's check him out.

322
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:54,202
His name's Jeremy Creek.
This is a picture of him 12 years ago.

323
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:58,107
- This I took four hours ago.
- That's impossible.

324
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,577
He'd be 26.
Must be a kid who looks like him.

325
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:03,982
I thought he was a twin,
until we checked this.

326
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,213
He left the state infirmary.

327
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:11,121
He'd been in a coma for 12 years,
suffering from electrolyte imbalance.

328
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,661
- Hasn't aged a day.
- He just woke up?

329
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,230
There was an electrical storm.

330
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:19,368
The hospital's generator went down,
and when it came back on, he was gone.

331
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,798
Electricity charged him up.

332
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,702
He's back, putting former
jocks into comas. Why?

333
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:30,643
Because 12 years ago today, they chose
Jeremy Creek as the scarecrow.

334
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,078
"Comatose boy found 20
yards from meteor strike. "

335
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:39,413
- The blast must have done something.
- No, this can't be right.

336
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:44,491
- I think you ought to show him.
- Show me what?

337
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:55,930
It started out as a scrapbook
and just mutated.

338
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,369
What is it?

339
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:00,701
I call it the Wall of Weird.

340
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:05,506
It's every strange event that's happened
in Smallville since the meteor shower.

341
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,413
That's when it all began.
The town went schizo.

342
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:16,185
- What do you think?
- Why didn't you tell me about this?

343
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:21,727
Do you tell me everything about
your life? We all keep secrets.

344
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,567
Lana?

345
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:38,344
My fault.

346
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,248
It's all my fault.

347
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:00,094
Chloe, just leave me alone.

348
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:04,170
Congratulations, Clark.
You're this year's scarecrow.

349
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:07,843
- Don't mess with me right now.
- Come on, bring it on!

350
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,085
- What's with you and Lana?
- Nothing.

351
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,960
Like her necklace? Huh?

352
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:32,224
Good, because it's as close
as you'll ever get to her.

353
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,501
Never changes.

354
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,169
Help me.

355
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,234
Hurts, doesn't it?

356
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,016
You're Jeremy.

357
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,379
I thought if I punished
them, it'd stop.

358
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:25,315
But it never stops.

359
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,085
Wait.

360
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:33,591
Where are you going?

361
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:37,561
Homecoming dance.
I never made it to mine.

362
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:41,327
Get me down. Please?

363
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,700
You're safer here.

364
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,954
Help me.

365
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,596
Help me.

366
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,571
Clark?

367
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,919
Oh, jeez.

368
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,381
Who did this to you?

369
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,750
Doesn't matter.

370
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,625
You need to see a doctor.

371
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:50,272
- I'll be okay.
- At least let me give you a ride.

372
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:32,007
Jeremy, you need to stop this.

373
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,418
I don't know how you got here.

374
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:46,660
- You should have stayed away.
- I won't let you hurt my friends.

375
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,559
Those people aren't your friends.

376
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,258
The sprinklers will get them wet.
I'll handle the rest.

377
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:55,801
- They never did a thing to you.
- This isn't for me.

378
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,031
This is for others like us!

379
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:02,775
What happened to you was my fault.
I can understand your pain.

380
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,106
I'm not in pain.

381
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:07,112
I have a gift...

382
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:11,014
...a purpose and a destiny.

383
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:12,619
So do I.

384
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,994
Give it up, Jeremy.

385
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:31,965
Are you okay?

386
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:33,931
Who are you?

387
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,733
Where am I?

388
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:44,107
I'm Clark Kent,
and you're in Smallville.

389
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:48,878
I want to go home.

390
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,209
What is that?

391
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,878
Who did this to my truck?

392
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,662
- The one on top.
- That's cool.

393
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:24,308
Your grandfather gave me
that telescope...

394
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,982
...when I was about your age.

395
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:33,345
I came downstairs for breakfast
one morning, and there it was.

396
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,858
Are you okay?

397
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:50,871
Can I answer that
in about five years?

398
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,240
Yeah.

399
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:04,452
Dad.

400
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:09,483
I'm glad you and Mom are the ones
that found me.

401
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,324
We didn't find you, Clark.

402
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,662
You found us.

403
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:38,512
I didn't see you tonight, Clark.

404
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:41,420
Lana.

405
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,489
What are you doing here?

406
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,267
I saved you that dance.

407
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:16,115
Is everything okay, Clark?

408
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,288
It's perfect.

409
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:48,213
Thanks for the dance, Lana.
