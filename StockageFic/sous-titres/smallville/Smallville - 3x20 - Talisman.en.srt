1
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:11,134
Professor, why did we let Luthor do this?
Look at this place.

2
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,745
He's done nothing but
defile our holy ground.

3
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:16,177
History has taught us to
walk among our enemies.

4
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,283
Yeah, while they walk all over us?

5
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,011
I understand your anger, Jeremiah...

6
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:25,089
...but we have no access to these
caves without his permission.

7
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:35,323
Professor Willowbrook, thank you for
coming on such short notice.

8
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:41,270
I didn't realize you'd be bringing
someone with you, though.

9
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,899
This is Jeremiah Holdsclaw, future
leader of the Kawatche people...

10
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:48,205
...and one of my brightest
graduate students.

11
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:50,213
-Oh.
-He may be able to help...

12
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,442
...identify the artifact.

13
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,287
Jeremiah, it's an honor to meet you.

14
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,493
Perhaps you could show us what you found.

15
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,231
Yes, of course. Miriam.

16
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,932
What do you...?

17
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,401
What do you make of this, professor?

18
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,075
Incredible. Palak.

19
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,373
Palak.

20
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:26,849
What is Palak?

21
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,488
Ancient traditional cookware.

22
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,316
Cookware?

23
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,456
Beautiful example.

24
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,493
Jeremiah, what do you think it is?

25
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,464
I think the professor is right.

26
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,829
I think we should take it back to the
museum to properly study it.

27
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,997
Oh, no. It can't leave the cave.

28
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,110
Not until I've had it
thoroughly analyzed. Miriam.

29
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:57,315
If you are the friend of the Kawatche
that you claim to be...

30
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,475
...then why won't you let us take it now?

31
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:04,713
Professor, would you give
me the artifact, please?

32
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,891
Jeremiah, you're embarrassing me.

33
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:13,863
Professor, this is ancient Kawatche soil.

34
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,231
Everything in here belongs to us.

35
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,337
No! No!

36
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,250
Give it to me.

37
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:46,094
Give me the knife, Jeremiah.

38
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,668
Find him.

39
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,469
And bring me that knife.

40
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,088
Professor Willowbrook?

41
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,718
Those are a lot of steps for
an old man to climb.

42
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,786
I'm sorry I haven't seen you lately.

43
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:01,093
-Between the farm and school, l--
-No need to make excuses, Naman.

44
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,833
Don't worry.

45
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,562
Your secret is safe with me.

46
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,231
I'm not Naman.

47
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,138
It's just a story on a cave wall.

48
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,114
Until last night, I believed that too.

49
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,279
What happened last night?

50
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,884
Your destiny was revealed.

51
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,446
It's called Palak...

52
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,821
...the Star Blade. It's been missing
for 500 years.

53
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,791
Until Lionel Luthor unearthed it.

54
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:33,357
It shines a light on Sageeth
so Naman can identify and destroy...

55
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,761
...his greatest enemy.

56
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,402
And Willowbrook came because
he thinks you are Naman?

57
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,806
Dad, you should've seen the way he looked
at me. It was kind of overwhelming.

58
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,875
Well, Clark, he thinks you're
the savior of his people.

59
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,512
That's a lot to shoulder.
Even-- Even for you.

60
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,908
Yeah, but I'm not.

61
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,846
-I mean, I can barely take care of myself.
-Sit down.

62
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:57,984
Look, you can't allow yourself to get all tied
up in prophecies written on a cave wall.

63
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,191
Except some of the prophecies
are starting to come true.

64
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,589
What?

65
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:06,459
One of Willowbrook's students got ahold
of the blade, and it's given him powers.

66
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,623
What exactly are we talking about here?

67
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,702
So far, strength, speed
and he's bulletproof.

68
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,469
How is that possible?

69
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,101
The Kawatche were charged
with its safe keeping.

70
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,709
Holding it, they're given
the power to protect it...

71
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,346
...until they can deliver
it to the true Naman.

72
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,205
Clark...

73
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,042
...I had your abilities for a short time...

74
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,984
...but, believe me, having all
that power was intoxicating.

75
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,484
You don't think Jeremiah's
gonna give it back.

76
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,120
No.

77
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:39,628
Clark, you've got to find him and stop him
before Lionel Luthor gets ahold of it.

78
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,572
Why won't you listen to me? I told
you I don't wanna talk about it!

79
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,140
Note to self, forward all
telemarketing calls to Pete.

80
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,675
You wanna tell me what that was about?

81
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,779
It was nothing.

82
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:58,710
Did you pull an all-nighter, or do you
just find changing clothes too cliche?

83
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,013
I was a little laundry-impaired this morning.

84
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,880
How bohemian of you.

85
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,525
Hey, do you want to cover
the gymnastics tryouts?

86
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,556
I'm sorry, can you find someone else?

87
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:14,325
Pete Ross passing up the opportunity to
ogle Smallville High's women in spandex?

88
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,866
Look, I just can't do it, okay?

89
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,532
I gotta get to class.

90
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,470
Well, hang on a second,
and I'll walk with you.

91
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,347
Or not.

92
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,421
-Dad, I came as soon as I heard.
-Lex, l--

93
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:42,822
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

94
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:47,989
Would you excuse us, please?
Yeah, I'm fine, son. I just...

95
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,466
...bruised a few ribs, that's all.

96
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:55,496
The rumor's floating around that
the person who attacked you...

97
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,075
...was holding an ancient
Kawatche artifact...

98
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,805
...that supposedly gave him
superhuman strength and speed.

99
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:06,578
Well, if that were true,
wouldn't that be a prize?

100
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,114
Is that why you've come?

101
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,086
I don't live in the past anymore, Dad.

102
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,786
Someone told me it was a weakness.

103
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,029
Given your recent mishaps in the cave...

104
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,134
...maybe you should start
following your own advice.

105
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,434
Dad...

106
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,941
...why don't you let me use some law
enforcement relationships to track this guy.

107
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,604
Considering what you and I have
been going through recently...

108
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:39,842
...this filial concern of yours is...

109
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,647
...touching and a little surprising.

110
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,855
Who are you, Lex?

111
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,286
Dad...

112
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,162
...no matter what our differences...

113
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,030
...I'm always gonna be concerned
about your well-being.

114
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,099
You know, Lex, the only thing more
bruised than my ribs is my ego.

115
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,645
Any more publicity
would only embarrass me.

116
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,510
So the cave....

117
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:15,916
What do you say? Let's let
the matter drop, all right?

118
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,198
You didn't get in?

119
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,639
No, no. I got accepted.

120
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,540
They turned down my financial aid,
which means I can't go.

121
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,243
Well, wait a minute.

122
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:51,484
Before you commit yourself to pouring
lattes in the Sunflower State...

123
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,182
...why don't you talk to Lex?

124
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,828
Chloe, I am not asking Lex for a loan.

125
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,430
Why not? You know he would
happily lend it to you.

126
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,561
But I wanted to do this on my own.

127
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,930
Well, selfishly, I would be
glad if you decided to stay.

128
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,166
But if Lex were in your shoes,
do you think...

129
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:13,335
...that he would let one bump in the road
deter him from pursuing his dreams?

130
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,139
Call him.

131
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,530
Here for the prospective-students tour,
Clark?

132
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,542
Did you do this?

133
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:48,070
Now, what possible reason would
I have to ransack the office...

134
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,908
...of an obscure teaching assistant?

135
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,384
Then tell me why you're here.

136
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,416
You first.

137
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,649
Jeremiah was gonna help
me with a term paper.

138
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,921
Term paper.

139
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:08,561
Your visit doesn't have anything to do with
the fact that he went ballistic last night...

140
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,897
...and absconded with a
sacred Kawatche artifact.

141
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,334
I didn't know.

142
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,602
Well, I'm surprised.

143
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:23,112
I mean, you usually keep such a close eye
on everything that happens in the caves.

144
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:27,150
-For those papers you're always writing.
-You still haven't told me why you're here.

145
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,254
Well, according to the legend
of Naman and Sageeth...

146
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,222
...this missing artifact bestows
extraordinary abilities...

147
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,758
...on whoever possesses it.

148
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,293
You don't really believe that.

149
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:41,489
I like to keep my mind open
to extreme possibilities.

150
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,867
You're starting to sound like your father.

151
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,011
I guess I should be offended...

152
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,708
...but it looks like he's beaten
us both to the punch.

153
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,121
Tell me something, Clark.

154
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,027
Do you have any idea what this might be?

155
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,273
Oh...

156
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,104
...if you find your friend,
tell him I'd like to meet him.

157
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,769
And good luck with your term paper.

158
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,822
Even if I knew where he was,
what makes you think he'd listen to me?

159
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,019
But as I understand it,
you're not only his academic adviser...

160
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,925
...but you're his...

161
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,332
...spiritual counselor as well.

162
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,027
-Yes?
-So why not just explain to him...

163
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,229
...that the Star Blade isn't his to keep?

164
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:58,433
-What do you know about it?
-I've read your writings, professor.

165
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,772
It doesn't belong to you either.

166
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,972
You know, I have a considerable
amount of influence around here.

167
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,380
-Yes?
-ls that a threat?

168
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,247
No. Of course not.

169
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,513
But I'm fascinated by your work.

170
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:14,090
I'm thinking about giving your
department a sizable grant...

171
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,990
...so you can continue your research.

172
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:21,629
Don't tell me an educated man like you
puts stock in old lndian legends.

173
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,735
Look, professor...

174
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:28,602
...you and I both saw what
Jeremiah did in the cave.

175
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,266
I've suspected for some
time that there are...

176
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:36,380
...special human beings who are
capable of feats like that.

177
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,811
Now I know I'm right.

178
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,446
If you've read my work...

179
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:44,578
...then you also know that the blade will
crumble if the wrong person touches it.

180
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,657
Yes.

181
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,618
Sageeth.

182
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:55,700
-Who is he?
-According to legend...

183
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,496
...he's the bearer of darkness.

184
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:05,676
Clark. Well, this is a coincidence.

185
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,012
Nice to see you.

186
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,147
Professor.

187
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,943
What did he want?

188
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,589
The same thing you do, Naman.

189
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,788
Professor, please stop calling me that.

190
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,353
One who denies his destiny...

191
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,021
...can bring about as much pain and
suffering as your greatest enemy.

192
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,191
Please, professor, I'm just here to help.

193
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:34,500
I don't want Jeremiah to hurt
anyone, including himself.

194
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,665
This mural was painted on
the blinds in his office.

195
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,367
I tried drawing it.

196
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,814
Clark, that's the slumbering place.

197
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,480
The burial ground where the ancient
Kawatche used to perform death rituals.

198
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,959
Jeremiah's writing his dissertation about it.

199
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,029
Does it still exist?

200
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,452
Jeremiah.

201
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,261
Jeremiah doesn't exist anymore, professor.

202
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:36,592
You can't allow the power of the
blade to cloud your judgment.

203
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,902
It's made things very clear.

204
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,874
Your duty is to protect the blade
for Naman. He's Naman.

205
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,437
Him? He's not even Kawatche.

206
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,185
Look, it doesn't really matter who I am.

207
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,418
The blade is dangerous, Jeremiah.

208
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,417
It's given me the strength of 1 0 men.

209
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,389
I can shoot fire from my eyes.

210
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,791
Don't you see, professor?

211
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,857
I am Naman.

212
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:11,128
You're misinterpreting
the prophecy, Jeremiah.

213
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,901
All these years, I've listened to you.

214
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,477
But now I can see you've held me back.

215
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:27,084
You're afraid that I've become
more powerful than you.

216
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:31,655
Jeremiah, it's the blade.
It's corrupting you. Just put it down.

217
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,457
I don't take orders from anyone.

218
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,360
I will be the savior of my people.

219
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,863
I will bring Sageeth here and kill him!

220
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,797
You don't even know who Sageeth is.

221
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,766
You could kill an innocent person.

222
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,504
The man I want...

223
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,401
...is far from innocent.

224
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,364
Stay out of my way, false prophet.

225
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,304
Clark, do you have any idea
where he went?

226
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,573
I'm pretty sure he's
going after Lionel Luthor.

227
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,467
Because he thinks Lionel is Sageeth.

228
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,170
I remember when you first
learned about this from Kyla.

229
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:06,477
She said-- Thanks. She said Sageeth was
supposed to start as one of the good guys.

230
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,415
But the prophecy isn't written down.

231
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:13,318
It's an oral tradition, so it's open
to a million different interpretations.

232
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,982
What's your interpretation?

233
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,754
I don't know. Professor Willowbrook...

234
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,158
...thinks that I'm Naman.

235
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,225
And Jor-El wants me to be some
sort of Kryptonian warrior...

236
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,936
...but I just want to be Clark Kent.

237
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:30,669
Well, you are Clark Kent, and like it or not,
you're the only one who can stop this kid.

238
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,002
-We need to warn Lionel.
-No.

239
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,612
Jonathan, you just said--

240
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,115
I don't want to give him information...

241
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,277
...that can help him find this weapon
before Clark does.

242
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:47,450
Son, what you need to do is, you need to
find Jeremiah before he kills Lionel.

243
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:52,593
Dad, even if I do find Jeremiah, I don't
know how to get the knife away from him.

244
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,467
If he does have your abilities, there's a
good chance that he has your weakness.

245
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:11,507
Now, I know what you're going to say.
This faux Egyptian decor is terribly tacky.

246
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:15,483
So I'm gonna need you to just use your
imagination and you will see the potential.

247
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,088
And keep in mind,
location, location, location.

248
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,122
-Hi, can I help you?
-Yes.

249
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,624
Earl Grey, please.
And whatever my client wants.

250
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:26,389
Take a look up on the second floor.
There's a very nice living space--

251
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,229
Miss, I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

252
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,669
The Talon's not for sale.

253
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,965
Well, it is, dear.
Lex Luthor hired me to sell it.

254
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,599
Excuse me.

255
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:42,411
-I'm part-owner. You can't just--
-Take it up with him.

256
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:54,084
You can't just sell the Talon
without consulting me.

257
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,360
I thought that's what you wanted
so you could afford to go to Paris.

258
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,363
No, I asked you to buy me out of my share.
I didn't ask you to sell the building.

259
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,228
Either way, you get the money.

260
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,927
I put my heart and soul into that place, Lex.

261
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:11,167
My friends hang out there, it's a sanctuary.
I do not want it turned into a Kinko's.

262
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:15,177
Lana, this may come as a shock to you,
but the Talon's not exactly a cash cow.

263
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:19,113
And personally, I have no
interest in the coffee business.

264
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,145
It's much more profitable
to sell the building.

265
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:27,390
If the Talon is such a terrible investment,
then why'd you keep it this long?

266
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,423
I thought that was obvious.

267
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,499
I did it for you.

268
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,702
I spend so much time swimming
with Wall Street sharks...

269
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,535
...and boardroom barracudas...

270
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,135
...that it's been nice to come up for air...

271
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,145
...with someone as honest
and pure-hearted as you.

272
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:54,081
In some ways, you're the
best partner I've ever had.

273
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,912
Thank you, Lex.

274
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:02,318
But you're leaving, and you're irreplaceable.

275
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,194
So why hang on to something that's over?

276
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,605
Unless, of course, this is really
about you having second thoughts.

277
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,767
What? No, l--

278
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,605
Because you've got to ask
yourself, Lana, who are you?

279
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:27,947
Are you a small-town girl
content to spend her days...

280
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,418
...gossiping in a coffee shop
with her friends?

281
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,556
Or are you the girl who goes to Paris?

282
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,911
What do you want?

283
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,816
The same thing as you.

284
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:11,156
To insure the well-being
of the Kawatche people.

285
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,794
Then stop pillaging their caves.

286
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:18,493
But who rightfully owns the cave, Clark?

287
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:22,606
Your family? They seem to believe they do.

288
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,439
That's funny. I could say
the same thing about you.

289
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,243
You want me to leave the Kawatche alone?
Deliver a message for me.

290
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,316
Tell them to return the stolen artifact.

291
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,180
Well, I'd be careful if I were you.

292
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,788
They say that artifact is dangerous.

293
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:42,825
Acquiring anything valuable always
involves a certain amount of risk...

294
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:47,124
...and I believe that that knife is valuable...

295
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,665
...in more ways than one.

296
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,796
-What are you talking about?
-We'll have to run tests to be sure.

297
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,566
But I believe that that Star Blade...

298
00:22:56,742 --> 00:23:00,109
...is forged from the same metal
as the octagonal key.

299
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:05,648
It might be possible to use the metal
from the knife to create a duplicate.

300
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:11,322
-I thought the original was in the cave wall.
-My scientists haven't been able to find it.

301
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,559
You honestly believe that I'd help you?

302
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,160
Why are we playing games, Clark?

303
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:21,231
You're as eager as I am to unlock
the mysteries of the cave.

304
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:25,294
Even if I wanted to help you, the
Kawatche don't take orders from me.

305
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,267
Don't be modest.

306
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,408
I'm sure they believe, as I do,
you're a very...

307
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:35,303
...special young man. They'll believe you.

308
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:44,347
You can also tell the professor
that I can turn...

309
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:49,222
...from being a loyal ally to
his very formidable nemesis...

310
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,026
...in a heartbeat.

311
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,523
The friend who becomes the enemy.

312
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,969
I beg your pardon?

313
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:06,034
Mr. Luthor, those caves may not belong to
my family, but this barn does. So get out.

314
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,783
Professor.

315
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,926
Have you found Jeremiah?

316
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,857
Not yet, but I have an idea.
I need your help.

317
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,021
I'm at your service, Naman.

318
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:30,032
I know you want to believe it,
but I'm-- I'm not your savior.

319
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,796
I mean, did you ever think
that Jeremiah really is Naman?

320
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,371
He has all the abilities
foretold in the prophecy...

321
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,667
...and he's gonna try and kill Sageeth.

322
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:42,610
True, but he did not fall from
the sky in a rain of fire.

323
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:46,249
Jeremiah is desperate
to be someone he's not.

324
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:50,320
And you are desperate
not to be someone you are.

325
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:59,829
Professor, I may be confused about who
I am, but one thing I'm not is a killer.

326
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,593
You'd be surprised what you're
capable of when the time comes.

327
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:06,032
Now, how can I help you?

328
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,297
Well, if I can't find Jeremiah...

329
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,941
...maybe I can get him to come to me.

330
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,441
Do you have any way to contact him?

331
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:17,070
I could try to pass him a message
through other members of the tribe.

332
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:21,643
But after last night,
I doubt if he'll listen to me.

333
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,618
That depends on the message.

334
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,136
What are you doing here?

335
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:46,933
Professor Willowbrook sent me a message.

336
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:51,515
He told me that after he saw what
I could do, he knew he was wrong.

337
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,647
-I'm the true Naman.
-I never claimed to be Naman.

338
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,081
Liar.

339
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,620
Willowbrook says you're a false prophet.

340
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,985
That before I kill Sageeth, I have to kill you.

341
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,668
What's this?

342
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,573
Danny, what's--?

343
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,407
What's happening?
Danny, why have we stopped?

344
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,228
Danny?

345
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:57,138
Hey, I thought I had the monopoly
on burning the candle at both ends.

346
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:01,503
Actually, I was just heading to
the Torch to print out my term paper.

347
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,379
Oh, yeah. What good are extracurriculars
if you can't milk them for office supplies.

348
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:09,884
Just lock up when you're done
and try to turn everything off, okay?

349
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,420
-Okay.
-Oh, hey.

350
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:15,286
I saw your mom at the courthouse. You
didn't tell me she was up for a judgeship.

351
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,160
Actually, she doesn't have the job yet.

352
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,594
With her record, she's a shoo-in.
I was talking to a couple people--

353
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:25,862
You don't stop until you
get your scoop, do you?

354
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:32,064
I was just trying to show
a little interest in your life.

355
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,575
I'm your friend.
I'm not just some random reporter.

356
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,715
Oh, you see, that-- That's the problem.

357
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,676
You're both.

358
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:42,285
And it's pretty obvious
which one comes first.

359
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:46,955
-What's with you, Pete?
-Not everything is public domain, Chloe!

360
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:54,158
Now I understand why Clark gets so mad
at you for trying to bust into his private life.

361
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,229
Here.

362
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,943
-Clark!
-Clark!

363
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,343
Clark!

364
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,855
Jonathan, he barely has a pulse.

365
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,515
Help me get him over.

366
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,992
Oh, God.

367
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:34,494
Martha, why don't you go get something
to help stop the bleeding, sweetheart.

368
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:53,455
You better-- You better hurry, sweetheart.

369
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,822
Come on, Clark.

370
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:26,418
Jonathan, how did you...?

371
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,422
I have no idea.

372
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,005
Mom? Dad?

373
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,113
Sweetheart, thank God.

374
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,251
-What happened?
-We found you bleeding to death.

375
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:07,326
Blade must've been made
of Kryptonian metal.

376
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:09,464
I guess my body healed itself.

377
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,595
Actually...

378
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,735
...your father did it.

379
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,768
How?

380
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:19,102
I have no idea, Clark.

381
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:23,980
One minute I was trying to stop the blood,
and the next minute you were healed.

382
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,145
You saved my life.

383
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,879
I didn't save your life, son.

384
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,224
I was just the vessel.

385
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,122
For Jor-El?

386
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:42,062
Well, however it happened,
we should be grateful.

387
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,796
He's not done with either of us, is he?

388
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,133
Clark, Lex called last night.

389
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,839
Jeremiah has Lionel.

390
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,342
-I know where they are. I'll go.
-Clark...

391
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,311
...Jeremiah tried to kill you.

392
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,574
Martha...

393
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:02,749
...Iet him go.

394
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,605
Now, Sageeth...

395
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,551
...you'll bring no more darkness
to my people.

396
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,633
I don't know how you survived.

397
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,418
But you won't do it twice.

398
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,235
Dad!

399
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,510
Lex, it's Jeremiah.

400
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,012
-Where's--? Where's Jeremiah?
-I don't know, Dad.

401
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,616
I'm gonna get you out of here
before he comes back.

402
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,275
Where's...?

403
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,006
Come on!

404
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,913
According to Chloe's sources...

405
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:49,349
...the doctors at Belle Reve think that
Jeremiah may never come out of his coma.

406
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:55,085
I guess having all those abilities
really took a toll on his body.

407
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:02,364
Well, son, at least we know that the knife
won't ever hurt you or anybody else again.

408
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:06,165
It also means the prophecy came true.

409
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:13,266
The blade glowed and then disintegrated
when they touched it...

410
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,906
...which means either Lionel or Lex
is my greatest enemy.

411
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,777
Did you see which one grabbed it first?

412
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:27,116
No. But I don't need a blade to tell
me that Lionel Luthor's a bad person.

413
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,452
If you're gonna believe this legend...

414
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,994
...you have to face the possibility
that it could be Lex.

415
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,068
I'm not ready to do that.

416
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,570
Clark...

417
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,902
...the Kawatche think that you're a savior.

418
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,578
Jor-El wants you to be a conqueror. Now...

419
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:53,979
...knife or not, you can't let
other people tell you what to be.

420
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,086
Who do you think I'll become?

421
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,983
I don't know.

422
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,717
You could be the world's greatest hero.

423
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,855
Or its most mild-mannered citizen...

424
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:08,997
...but the only person who
can write your story...

425
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:11,996
...is you.

426
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,242
Is this where they're holding
the partnership meeting?

427
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,047
We got another offer.

428
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,352
Chloe and her dad.

429
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,260
I never would have predicted that one.

430
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,121
They want to keep the place
exactly as it is...

431
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,825
...and let me stay on as part-owner...

432
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:48,403
...so I can go back to work
when I get home from school in Paris.

433
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:53,138
Sounds too good to pass up.

434
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,441
I turned them down.

435
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,619
Without consulting me?

436
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:07,724
I don't think Chloe was ever really
interested in running the place anyway.

437
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:12,557
I think she was just having some
trouble letting go of the past.

438
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:16,993
But I don't want anything
pulling me back to Smallville.

439
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:23,137
I thought about what you said, Lex.
About who I am...

440
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:26,401
...and I decided...

441
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,740
...I'm the girl who goes to Paris.

442
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,201
Chloe, what are you doing here?

443
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,838
I think I should be asking you that.

444
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,836
Just give me a minute,
and I'll get out of your way.

445
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:04,305
You know, when my parents split,
I hid out in the garage.

446
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,007
I didn't have my driver's license yet.

447
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:11,748
Your mom called today. She asked
me if I'd seen you, and I said I hadn't.

448
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,856
She tried to brush it off.

449
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:17,051
She said you were probably
hanging out with Clark.

450
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,060
But you weren't.

451
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,464
Mystery solved.

452
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:29,169
Yeah.

453
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,138
I'm guessing you didn't tell me
about your mom's job offer...

454
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,710
...because it wasn't a good thing, was it?

455
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,041
I thought she'd turn it down right away.

456
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:42,409
But it doesn't look like
that's gonna happen.

457
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:55,095
Well, having been through my
own version of divorce court...

458
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,791
...I know how difficult it can be.

459
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:03,772
Do you think there's any chance
that they'll work it out?

460
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,111
My dad's helping her move to Wichita.

461
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:13,706
I guess I just didn't realize
how bad it was between them.

462
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,678
This just seems like an
excuse for her to leave.

463
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:25,353
It just feels like it's somebody
else's life and not mine.

464
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,212
Surprise.

465
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:55,751
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about this prophecy.

466
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,229
I've got a new interpretation.
Wanna hear it?

467
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,789
Sure.

468
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:04,959
May l?

469
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:19,705
This Naman guy is supposed
to come from the stars...

470
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:24,378
...have the power of 1 0 men
and shoot fire from his eyes, right?

471
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,455
It's just an allegory, Lex.

472
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,251
I know.

473
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,995
But if one person could do all that...

474
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,126
...he would be a formidable enemy.

475
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,796
He could conquer the world.

476
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:44,497
He could become a tyrant
if nobody kept him in check.

477
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,203
So I've been thinking...

478
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,910
...anybody who'd be willing to fight him...

479
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,518
...would have to be pretty brave.

480
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,686
Clark...

481
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:05,592
...did it ever occur to you that maybe
the hero of the story...

482
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,426
...is Sageeth?

483
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
