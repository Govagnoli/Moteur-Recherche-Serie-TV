1
00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:08,335
How much will you give me for it?

2
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,542
Fifty bucks.

3
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:12,410
It's made out of gold.

4
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:15,714
-Who told you that?
-My mother.

5
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:19,415
Tell her it's a fake.

6
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,887
I can't.

7
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,022
She's dead.

8
00:00:29,998 --> 00:00:32,023
I'll give you sixty bucks.

9
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:01,395
So, what's the deal?

10
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:05,328
-I told you, I don't want to do this anymore.
-Oh, this is our last job.

11
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:07,464
Liar.

12
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,838
We're all you've got, kid.

13
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,973
Tell me the combination.

14
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:20,842
25-13-29.

15
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,040
Good boy.

16
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:30,522
Okay, you know the drill, right?

17
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:35,922
-Let's do this.
-Get the bag. Let's go.

18
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:38,894
Don't forget my angel.

19
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:08,826
What's going on here?
Hey, who are you people?

20
00:02:08,997 --> 00:02:11,329
Oh, my God, no! No!

21
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:16,030
Oh, my God, I think he's dead.

22
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:18,971
-Let's go!
-No. What did you do that for?

23
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,075
It was him or us, baby. We gotta go!

24
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:23,870
Come on.

25
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,778
Where's he going? Go.

26
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,447
Ryan!

27
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:54,571
Oh, my God.

28
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,611
Are you all right?

29
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:06,319
-Are you all right?
-I lost my shoe.

30
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:09,888
I'm taking you to the hospital. Come on.

31
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:24,295
He checks out physically,
just scrapes and bruises.

32
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,558
Have you managed
to contact his parents yet?

33
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:30,200
Other than knowing his name,
Ryan claims to have no memory.

34
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,929
Are you saying he has amnesia?

35
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:35,439
True amnesia is extremely rare.
It's most likely post-traumatic shock.

36
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:39,911
His memory will probably return
within 24 to 48 hours.

37
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:42,242
What if it doesn't?

38
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:43,780
Martha, Jonathan.

39
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,426
It's unlikely all Ryan's cuts and bruises
were caused by the accident.

40
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:58,088
-You think he's been abused?
-He may not want to remember.

41
00:04:58,533 --> 00:04:59,795
What will happen to him?

42
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,333
We've called Child Services,
but they're understaffed...

43
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,664
...and can't come
until tomorrow at the earliest.

44
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:08,741
So the only place for Ryan to stay
is at the juvenile cell at the sheriff's station.

45
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,277
-That's no place for a child.
-Why can't he come home with us?

46
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,740
-That's a great idea.
-Can we do that?

47
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:17,840
I'll have to make some calls,
but I don't see why not.

48
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:21,416
It'd be a big help to us,
and I'm sure Ryan would appreciate it.

49
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:32,499
-Clark?
-It's me, Mrs. Kent.

50
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:37,036
-Ryan, did you do all this?
-I hope you don't mind. I couldn't sleep.

51
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:43,133
-Hey, what's the occasion?
-I wanted to make myself useful.

52
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:46,442
-Thanks for letting me stay here.
-Stay as long as you want.

53
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:49,344
Maybe some of you
will rub off on Clark.

54
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:52,618
What does everybody want?
Let me guess...

55
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:54,379
...pancakes...

56
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,951
...with powdered sugar...

57
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,493
...not syrup.

58
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,723
-How did you know that?
-I saw you eyeing them when you came in.

59
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:09,098
Scrambled eggs...

60
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:10,961
...bacon...

61
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:14,539
...coffee with milk
and a little bit of honey.

62
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:18,538
Well, that is some trick there, kiddo.

63
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,004
-Hey, Mom.
-Hi.

64
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:22,012
Going all out for the new kid, huh?

65
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:24,913
Actually, Clark,
Ryan took care of all this himself.

66
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:26,678
You're making me look bad.

67
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:29,185
What do you want for breakfast?

68
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,424
-Don't you want anything, Clark?
-I'm just gonna have some pancakes.

69
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,397
Ryan, you okay?

70
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:45,802
Ryan, are you sure you don't remember
anything about last night?

71
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,100
You see, because I still can't figure out...

72
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:51,439
...why you were out on Route 90
at 10:00 at night.

73
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,239
I said I don't remember.

74
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:00,752
I'm not hiding anything.

75
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:05,285
No one said you were, buddy.

76
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:21,134
Guess your parents want me to leave now.

77
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,408
-Why would you think that?
-Because they don't believe me.

78
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:29,913
-We just want to help you get home.
-What if I don't have a home?

79
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:33,880
What if you found out I did bad things?
What would happen?

80
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:37,388
Ryan, everything's
gonna work out. I know it.

81
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:41,319
You like comics?

82
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,392
I like this one.

83
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,157
<i>Warrior Angel. Why him?</i>

84
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:49,828
Because he protects people
who can't protect themselves.

85
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:56,937
I like being around you, Clark.

86
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,739
It's peaceful.

87
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:06,411
Why don't you get your head out
of that comic and play a little ball?

88
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:29,039
-I know what you're thinking. I really suck.
-Nothing a little practice can't cure.

89
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,373
Go ahead. Get your hand up,
keep your elbows straight...

90
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:35,982
...just guide the ball with your fingers.

91
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:39,679
-He shoots, and he scores!
-Yeah.

92
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,185
Nice.

93
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,218
Excuse me.

94
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:51,556
-Yes.
-I'm looking for the boy from the paper.

95
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,859
You know, the one who lost his memory.

96
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,195
-And you are?
-A private detective.

97
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,203
I work for a couple who lost their son.

98
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,207
Is Ryan still around?

99
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:03,202
No...

100
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:07,643
...but if you just wait, I'll get Dr. Harden.
I know she'd like to speak with you.

101
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,918
All right.

102
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:28,095
That's a great sound, isn't it?

103
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:31,438
Yeah, it is.

104
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:41,181
Do you ever think we made the wrong
decision, not adopting another child?

105
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:44,815
Maybe sharing his secret
with a younger brother would have helped.

106
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,476
He seems to really like Ryan.

107
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:50,180
I don't think he's the only one.

108
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:55,920
-You've always had a soft spot for strays.
-Well, the last one turned out all right.

109
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:58,828
Here you go. One more.

110
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:02,632
Oh, nice.

111
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,632
I thought you were still in Monaco.

112
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:13,075
"The backbone of surprise
is fusing speed with secrecy."

113
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:15,977
<i>Von Clausevitz, On War.</i>

114
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,311
Isn't that a little '80s, Dad, even for you?

115
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:22,752
I never give my plant managers
a heads-up before a spot inspection.

116
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,619
What could you possibly have
to complain about now?

117
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:28,626
The plant's doing well,
LuthorCorp stock is up....

118
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,923
I'm not here to complain, Lex.

119
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:34,295
On the contrary.
Your performance lately has been...

120
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:39,330
...more than adequate.

121
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:43,304
That sounds dangerously like a compliment.

122
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,336
I push you, Lex, I don't deny it.

123
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:51,474
Greatness is a rarefied air
one has to be taught to breathe.

124
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:57,852
Philip of Macedonia raised his son
among lions to instill fearlessness in him.

125
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:01,256
Didn't he also try
to impale the kid with a spear?

126
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:03,692
In an aborted coup attempt...

127
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:07,630
...but history remembers that boy
as Alexander the Great.

128
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:11,065
You didn't come all this way
to lecture me on Greek history.

129
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:16,074
No. I want you to come back to Metropolis...

130
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:21,875
...where you will hold the position
"special advisor to the chairman emeritus."

131
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,517
That would be me.

132
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:28,519
-At least the title sounds important.
-It's more than a title. It's an opportunity.

133
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:32,056
It's what you've been waiting for
ever since you came to Smallville.

134
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:33,853
I'll think about it.

135
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:39,427
You want to keep me dangling,
so it looks like you're granting me a favor...

136
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,194
...instead of receiving one?

137
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,867
We don't need to play games, son.

138
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:52,672
Dad, games are all we've got.

139
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:59,919
-Wow, you're a modern-day Kaspar Hauser.
-Who's that?

140
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:03,079
Don't worry. Chloe's the queen
of obscure and irrelevant references.

141
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:05,848
He's a kid from the 19th century
with amnesia.

142
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,927
He showed up in a German town
without a memory of who he was...

143
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:11,360
...all he could remember was his name.

144
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:14,634
-What happened to him?
-Well, his story spread throughout Europe...

145
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:17,862
...and people from all over came to see
if he was their missing child.

146
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,836
Some people thought
he was the lost son of the grand duke.

147
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:25,202
-Did he ever find his parents?
-You know....

148
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:30,773
Yeah, he did.

149
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:37,282
He found his parents,
and they lived happily ever after.

150
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,395
Why didn't you just say he was murdered?

151
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,954
How did you know that?

152
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,969
You know, why don't we take that picture?

153
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,265
What picture?

154
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:56,334
You're not putting me
on that freak wall, are you?

155
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,307
It's called the Wall of Weird,
and no...

156
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:01,915
...this picture is just to check against
missing persons.

157
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:07,151
Okay, I'm gonna go download this.
I'll be there in a sec.

158
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,457
-She likes you.
-Yeah, we're friends.

159
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,360
She wants to be more than just friends.

160
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,057
-She wants you to ask her to the prom.
-Chloe?

161
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,861
-Yeah, right.
-No, really.

162
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,133
She already picked out a dress. It's pink.

163
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:32,369
Ryan, you just met Chloe,
and she hates dresses...

164
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,446
...and she's not exactly the prom type.

165
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:36,776
Maybe she has a romantic side
you never knew about.

166
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,477
Or maybe my mom hit you harder
than I thought.

167
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:43,949
Let's get a picture of my boys.

168
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:52,054
So how does it feel having
a little-brother-type figure in your life?

169
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:55,292
-It's pretty cool.
-I dreamed of having a brother or sister...

170
00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:57,630
...someone to talk to,
help fill the silence.

171
00:13:57,805 --> 00:14:00,774
Someone you can totally trust
and would always be there for you.

172
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,842
That's just how I see you, Clark.

173
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,572
Thanks.

174
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:17,155
<i>Warrior Angel. I'm a fan myself.</i>

175
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:20,788
-You must be Ryan. I'm--
-Lex Luthor.

176
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,356
Clark told me all about you.

177
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,125
-You know, I have one of the--
-First-edition panels framed in your house.

178
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:30,828
-How did you know that?
-You're rich.

179
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,302
That's what rich people do, collect stuff.

180
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:36,008
I see you've met Ryan.

181
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,576
<i>Apparently, we're both big
Warrior Angel fans.</i>

182
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:41,347
I didn't know you liked comic books.

183
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:45,076
A strange visitor from another planet
who protects the weak?

184
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:48,354
When I was young, he was my idol,
not to mention he's bald.

185
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:51,013
I have the whole collection.

186
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:53,983
-Maybe we'll come by later and check it out.
-Yeah.

187
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:57,790
-Would you like that, buddy?
-Whatever.

188
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:00,166
Whatever.

189
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:04,433
That was kind of rude.

190
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:08,905
-Lex is my friend.
-Don't worry about him. He's going to leave.

191
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,237
Lex's father offered him a new job.

192
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:15,245
You don't know Lex's father.
He would never do that.

193
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,945
You have to stop making up
stories about people.

194
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,454
I'll see you in a minute.

195
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,242
Ryan?

196
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,970
Ryan just took off out the back.
He looked scared, Clark.

197
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:36,657
Ryan?

198
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:17,497
Help!

199
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:19,330
Help!

200
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,803
Help!

201
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,824
You're safe now.

202
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:52,701
Clark, where's your young sidekick?

203
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,500
Sleeping.

204
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,339
He thinks you're his big brother.

205
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:02,107
Yeah, well, I guess I am, till tomorrow.

206
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:06,081
-The kid is growing on you.
-You know how it is.

207
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,813
Being an only child, no one else around.

208
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:11,480
Don't you ever wish you had a sibling?

209
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,555
I had one, Clark.

210
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:15,319
Really? I didn't know.

211
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,794
When I was 11,
my mother got pregnant again.

212
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:25,234
It was a total surprise.
I've never seen my father happier.

213
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,473
The day Julian was born
was the only time...

214
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:30,132
...I felt like I was part of a real family.

215
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,301
And what happened?

216
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,342
The morning of his baptism,
my mother went to his nursery...

217
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:40,111
...found him in his crib,
he had stopped breathing.

218
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:46,085
My mother was never the same after that,
and my father got even more distant.

219
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:50,857
I think he saw Julian as his second chance.

220
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:54,558
A chance for him to have a son
he could truly love.

221
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:57,201
I'm sorry.

222
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,902
It's in the past, Clark.

223
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:05,206
We would have ended up
hating each other, anyway.

224
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:08,280
My father would have seen to that.

225
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:14,509
But I didn't come over
to recount my family's tragic history.

226
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:18,086
My father has offered me a chance
to return to Metropolis.

227
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,627
Did you tell Ryan about that?

228
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:28,792
I haven't told anyone, Clark.

229
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:32,161
Well, that's what you always wanted.

230
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,102
I used to think it was.

231
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:37,036
Now I'm not so sure.

232
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:40,310
I was a different person there.

233
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,677
A different person around my father.

234
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:48,680
He wants an answer tomorrow night.
We're having dinner in Metropolis.

235
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,387
If anyone can choose
who they want to be, Lex...

236
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,222
...it's you.

237
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,598
-Knock, knock.
-Mr. Kent, this is a surprise.

238
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:11,574
Yeah, Ryan's been doing chores with me
all day, so I figured he deserved a break.

239
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:14,305
I'd like a cup of coffee,
give him whatever he wants...

240
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:17,814
...and if you can point me to a phone,
I'll see if Martha wants anything.

241
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:21,643
-All right, it's in the back.
-All right. Enjoy.

242
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:24,919
-So how you feeling today?
-Much better, thanks.

243
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,882
Good.

244
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,855
Do you think it's okay
if friends have secrets?

245
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:33,966
Strange question. Why do you ask?

246
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:37,326
Because I think
Clark is hiding something from me.

247
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,529
Everybody has secrets, Ryan.

248
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,936
Really? What's yours?

249
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,940
If I told you, then it wouldn't be a secret.

250
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,273
I guess you're right.

251
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:58,189
-Thanks, Skye, you're a lifesaver.
-You're welcome.

252
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:07,597
-Why the frown?
-She's not a good person, Lana.

253
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,796
You should fire her.

254
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,871
Ryan, why would you
say something like that?

255
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,473
Because it's the truth.

256
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,542
How do you know?

257
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:21,271
It's a secret.

258
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,258
Thanks for the hot chocolate, Mr. Kent.

259
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:49,669
Looks like Ryan
has found himself a new family.

260
00:21:55,282 --> 00:21:59,241
-It's time to get back to work.
-When do we get the kid?

261
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,054
When we're ready.

262
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:07,422
My mom hit him somewhere around here.

263
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:09,494
Thanks for helping with the clue hunt.

264
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:12,063
And help solve the riddle of Ryan?
It's my pleasure.

265
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:14,564
There really is a riddle.

266
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,133
I'm starting to think
he may not have amnesia.

267
00:22:17,304 --> 00:22:19,864
Clark, the kid adores you, why would he lie?

268
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:22,767
Because he's running from somebody.

269
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,407
I found something.

270
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:36,883
We got comic books...

271
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:38,718
...and Twizzlers.

272
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:42,020
Something every growing boy needs.

273
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:52,764
What? It's where I would hide something.

274
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,103
If you were a CIA operative.

275
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,503
Who do you think it is?

276
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:03,609
I don't know.... Mom, aunt?

277
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,876
And the mystery deepens.

278
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:09,249
I still can't figure out how he knew
that Kaspar Hauser was murdered.

279
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:12,755
Well, you weren't exactly
wearing a poker face.

280
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:15,520
Ryan does say weird things.

281
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:20,155
He even said that you wanted me to ask you
to prom and that you'd bought a dress.

282
00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:23,694
It's not pink, is it?

283
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:33,139
Okay, you know, I was just looking at it,
it's not like I actually bought it.

284
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:35,873
How would Ryan know that?

285
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:43,551
I don't know. Maybe he's an alien, or maybe
he called Miss Cleo. You know, I don't know.

286
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,425
Clark's the best thing
that ever happened to you.

287
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,031
Yeah, he is.

288
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,128
He makes up for not being able
to have your own kids.

289
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,062
He does.

290
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,138
-Has he always been so strong?
-What do you mean?

291
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:09,278
The way he tore off the back panel
of the garbage truck and saved me.

292
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,815
Don't be silly, he couldn't do that.

293
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,254
If you say so.

294
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:25,130
What's your greatest fear?

295
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:28,929
That I won't get this pie done
by the time you have to leave.

296
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:34,896
Why don't you go outside
and shoot some hoops?

297
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:17,973
-What are you doing down here?
-Clark, don't be mad.

298
00:25:18,318 --> 00:25:19,876
How'd you know about this?

299
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:23,255
I heard about it in your mom's mind.

300
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:30,763
I wanted to see it for myself.

301
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:36,133
Can you hear everything people think?

302
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:39,130
Only what's on the surface.

303
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:42,205
What they're thinking at that moment.

304
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:44,636
Except for you.

305
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:48,970
I can't read your mind.
That's how I knew you were different.

306
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:51,916
Now I know why.

307
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:55,418
I can't believe you'd do this.

308
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:59,521
I'll never tell.
You keep my secret, I'll keep yours.

309
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,124
-It's not that simple.
-Sure it is.

310
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:06,194
I know your dad's worried
that people are going to find out.

311
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:09,460
I can tell him
when someone's getting close.

312
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,033
I told you about Chloe.
I can tell you about Lana.

313
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:14,639
-You want to know her secret?
-No.

314
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:16,207
No, Ryan, I don't.

315
00:26:17,277 --> 00:26:18,676
Why not?

316
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:20,938
It's about you.

317
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:22,809
Look, you can't do this.

318
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:26,543
You don't understand
what it's like to be different.

319
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:31,656
What it's like to have to hide
so people won't think you're a freak.

320
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:35,019
Everywhere I go...

321
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:37,993
...I hear people's thoughts.

322
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,462
I can't block it out anymore.

323
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:48,937
Is this your mother?

324
00:26:53,246 --> 00:26:54,873
She died.

325
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,073
Why didn't you tell me?

326
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:01,017
I was hoping I could start over
with your family.

327
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:06,857
They were so nice.
I wanted them to adopt me like they did you.

328
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:09,690
So I'd be safe.

329
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:15,325
-Who's chasing you?
-My stepfather and his new wife.

330
00:27:16,536 --> 00:27:18,663
They've been using me.

331
00:27:19,272 --> 00:27:21,570
My abilities.

332
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:25,006
To steal.

333
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:30,814
I wanted to stop...

334
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,448
...but they threatened me.

335
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:37,248
They hit me.

336
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,223
You have to protect me, Clark.
You're the only one that can.

337
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,507
I'll get it.

338
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:14,118
You say anything, and I'll kill them.

339
00:28:16,963 --> 00:28:19,488
You know I will.

340
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,669
-So you must be Ryan.
-Can I help you?

341
00:28:23,937 --> 00:28:27,668
Mr. Kent, Child Services.
I'm here to pick up Ryan.

342
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,365
You're early. We weren't
expecting you for an hour.

343
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:33,311
We can't thank you enough
for taking Ryan in.

344
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:36,207
It's our pleasure.
He's welcome to stay longer.

345
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:39,442
Oh, I'm afraid that's impossible.
I need to put him in foster care.

346
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:41,814
That's the law.

347
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:44,479
Let's get your stuff.

348
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:53,957
We think Ryan might be running away
from his stepfather, so we alerted the police.

349
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:57,534
Don't worry, we'll keep him safe.
Ready to go?

350
00:28:58,972 --> 00:29:02,430
Could he wait and say goodbye
to our son, Clark? He'll be home any minute.

351
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:04,804
Oh, I'm sorry.

352
00:29:04,978 --> 00:29:07,242
It's okay, Mrs. Kent.

353
00:29:09,382 --> 00:29:11,316
Just tell him thanks.

354
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:14,647
If you need anything, just call us, okay?

355
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:31,596
Dad, what's wrong?

356
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:35,904
Child Services came and took Ryan away
about 15 minutes ago.

357
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,542
What?

358
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,042
Why didn't he wait for me?
I wanted to say goodbye.

359
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:42,374
I don't know, son...

360
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:45,540
...they said they were in a hurry.
I'm sorry.

361
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:06,628
On your way to Metropolis.

362
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:10,773
Yeah, for the big dinner.

363
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:12,274
I....

364
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:13,878
I wanted you to have something.

365
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:21,781
-A sword?
-It's a foil. Every hero should have one.

366
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:28,254
I guess this means
you've decided you're leaving.

367
00:30:28,428 --> 00:30:30,953
I haven't made up my mind
one way or the other.

368
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,759
If you haven't made up your mind,
why are you giving me a going-away present?

369
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:37,232
Keep that away from the kid.

370
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:40,770
-He's already gone.
-I'm sorry.

371
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,965
I know how much you liked him.

372
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:45,872
For what it's worth, I hope you stay.

373
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:39,457
Driver? Hey, what's going on?

374
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:41,757
Driver?

375
00:31:42,702 --> 00:31:44,636
-Inside, come on!
-What are you doing?

376
00:31:45,538 --> 00:31:47,529
Get in.

377
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,103
Mr. Luthor.

378
00:31:55,848 --> 00:31:58,715
-Ryan?
-Shut up.

379
00:31:59,652 --> 00:32:01,210
Okay, go. Go.

380
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:10,862
Getting the account number
to your trust fund was easy...

381
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,395
...now give me the password.

382
00:32:12,565 --> 00:32:15,398
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Tell me what it is.

383
00:32:15,568 --> 00:32:17,297
My father has it, I don't.

384
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,898
He's lying.

385
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:28,745
Password. Now.

386
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:37,279
You got it?

387
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,932
-Hey, Zorro, what's with the sword?
-It's a foil.

388
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,695
I'm guessing it's a gift
from our favorite millionaire playboy.

389
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:55,102
He's thinking of moving back to Metropolis.

390
00:32:55,575 --> 00:32:58,408
Well, I'm still here, Clark.
I'm not going anywhere.

391
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:06,417
Sources at the sheriff's office have given me
a heads-up on Ryan's stepdad.

392
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:10,586
-You have sources.
-Yeah, a cute officer in Traffic.

393
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,582
I talked my way out of a speeding ticket,
he told me I was plucky.

394
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,751
Maybe I'll ask him to prom.

395
00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:24,598
So Ryan's stepdad is a real catch.
He's a career criminal.

396
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:29,104
This is Lex's limo driver.

397
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:46,315
Give me the password.

398
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:52,155
Don't make me ask again.

399
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:56,124
It's "Julian."

400
00:34:09,749 --> 00:34:13,708
-Lex, are you okay?
-Yeah, I think so.

401
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:15,649
Which way did they go?

402
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:20,758
Straight down Route 90.
Clark, they've got Ryan. Get some help.

403
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:40,972
Get out. Torch the limo, baby!

404
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:46,850
Julian. Julian.

405
00:34:53,893 --> 00:34:56,919
Give me the real password.
Don't mess with me.

406
00:34:57,096 --> 00:35:00,190
-I'm not gonna tell you!
-I swear to God, I'll drop him right now.

407
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:02,857
Once he gets the money,
he's gonna kill you.

408
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,837
Don't listen to him.
He's talking trash to pull us apart.

409
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:13,602
We're just about to hit the jackpot, baby.
All we've gotta do is trust each other.

410
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:16,173
You know, this kid has always
freaked me out...

411
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:19,841
...but the one thing I'll say about him
is he never lied.

412
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:25,015
You know what?!

413
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:28,183
That's true...

414
00:35:28,828 --> 00:35:30,386
...he didn't.

415
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:36,531
Ryan!

416
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,900
-Hey, kid, where are you going?
-Call the police!

417
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,181
Ryan!

418
00:36:01,894 --> 00:36:03,987
You can't hide forever.

419
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:18,109
You know, your mother really hated you.

420
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:21,440
Couldn't stand having a freak for a son.

421
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:25,576
Come to think of it,
I wasn't that crazy about you either.

422
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:02,937
-Clark!
-It's okay, buddy.

423
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:13,718
You're safe now.

424
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:27,865
-Hi, Lana.
-Hey.

425
00:38:28,274 --> 00:38:30,868
-Ryan would like to say goodbye.
-Where are you going?

426
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:32,806
Edge City.

427
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:37,078
Chloe's research turned up an aunt there.
She's coming by this afternoon.

428
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:39,809
I wanted to thank you
for your advice on Skye.

429
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:43,785
You were right.
She was stealing from the till.

430
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,952
-Hey.
-Wow.

431
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:52,263
Thank you.

432
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:56,425
I think you made his year.

433
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,639
So you recover yet?

434
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:07,675
I don't know, but I'm definitely in love.

435
00:39:09,982 --> 00:39:12,280
Join the club.

436
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:21,382
Shouldn't you be packing?

437
00:39:23,062 --> 00:39:26,327
I'm not going back to Metropolis.

438
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:30,665
Come on, Lex, that's all you wanted
ever since I assigned you...

439
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:34,203
...to what you so eloquently refer to
as the "crap factory."

440
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:37,035
I know why you want me back.

441
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:39,609
I'm driving you crazy, aren't I?

442
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:45,375
I'm not clubbing till 6:00 a.m.,
not getting arrested. I'm on track.

443
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:47,280
That's what scares you.

444
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:50,650
You want me back where you can
keep an eye on me.

445
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:54,115
You're making a mistake, Lex.

446
00:39:56,228 --> 00:40:01,165
You know what those emperors you're so
fond of talking about were really afraid of?

447
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:03,499
That their sons would become successful...

448
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:06,433
...and return to Rome
at the head of their own army.

449
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:09,403
You think you can find
your future in Smallville.

450
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:13,477
I'm your future.

451
00:40:13,646 --> 00:40:16,638
Join me, Lex. Join me in Metropolis.

452
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:20,012
How long have you been waiting
to hear me say those words?

453
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:23,882
I've waited to hear other things
from you for a lot longer.

454
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:29,859
-I'll return to Metropolis when I'm ready.
-At the head of an army?

455
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:45,875
We're really going to miss you, Ryan.

456
00:40:46,045 --> 00:40:49,742
It gets cold in Edge City,
so I packed some of Clark's old jackets...

457
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:52,713
-...something for you to grow into.
-Thanks, Mrs. Kent.

458
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:56,018
You're welcome around here
any time you want.

459
00:40:57,523 --> 00:41:00,390
I know what you're worried about,
but don't be.

460
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:03,353
I'll keep Clark's secret.

461
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:07,695
I know what it's like to have to hide
who you are from the world.

462
00:41:14,273 --> 00:41:15,740
There she is.

463
00:41:19,278 --> 00:41:21,712
You sure you're gonna be all right?

464
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:25,481
She's a nice person.

465
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:27,911
She's just as nervous as I am.

466
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:36,961
Are you sure you don't want to know
how Lana feels about you?

467
00:41:37,129 --> 00:41:39,154
I prefer to find out on my own.

468
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:44,459
Clark....

469
00:41:46,138 --> 00:41:47,730
Be careful of Lex.

470
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:49,498
I know you like him...

471
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:52,143
...but there's a lot of darkness
he keeps from the world.

472
00:41:52,411 --> 00:41:54,902
I've seen it in his head.

473
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:58,646
I like to believe in people's best.

474
00:42:01,053 --> 00:42:03,419
I want you to have something.

475
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:11,155
-I can't take those.
-I don't need them anymore.

476
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:13,457
I have you.

477
00:42:27,413 --> 00:42:29,404
See you.

478
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:34,243
Bye.

479
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:49,329
Okay.

480
00:43:53,165 --> 00:43:54,154
