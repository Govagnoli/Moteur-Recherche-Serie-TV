1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,337
Advanced economics.
Smallville High's best and brightest.

2
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:07,870
Welcome to LuthorCorp.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,374
Now, you're all here
to learn something about business.

4
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:16,308
The most important element
in anything to do with economic theory...

5
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:17,949
...is the individual.

6
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:19,882
Yes...

7
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:21,644
...you.

8
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:26,417
Traditional rules, supply and demand,
they're secondary...

9
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:30,025
...but to rise above those rules,
to know when to break them...

10
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,632
...requires absolute personal commitment.

11
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:37,894
I consider it a prerequisite for success.

12
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:43,897
And I consider it despicable,
immoral and possibly illegal.

13
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:46,567
I'm sorry. Do you have a question?

14
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,108
No? Anybody else?

15
00:00:51,283 --> 00:00:55,845
No? All right, then, I'll hand you
back over to Mr. Simms.

16
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:58,216
All right, group, follow me.

17
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,086
-lt was a pleasure meeting you.
-Thank you.

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,125
Miss Sullivan, Mr. Kent.

19
00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:07,493
Well, it's nice to see you both
looking to the future.

20
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,636
Want to make a break for the fire escape?

21
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:18,539
I'd crawl down all 39 stories if this field trip
didn't count toward our final grade.

22
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,702
Welcome to the Lionel Luthor eXhibit.

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,849
Next floor: victims, sycophants
and hatchet men.

24
00:01:24,016 --> 00:01:26,814
How about I split up
this jaded little fan club?

25
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,853
Mr. Kent, take the neXt car.

26
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,562
Elevators.

27
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:50,367
Too much demand, not enough supply.

28
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,169
Oh, my God.

29
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:56,707
What did you just do?

30
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:59,940
Please, don't tell anyone about this.

31
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:04,047
Hello! Hello! Is anybody in there?

32
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:06,741
This is LuthorCorp security.
Remain calm.

33
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:11,418
If anybody's in there,
we're working to get you out!

34
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:13,284
Hang on!

35
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:28,204
What did you just do?

36
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,636
You didn't want to get caught,
and I wanted to help, so....

37
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:40,084
Clark, now you know my secret too.

38
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,887
You can't tell anybody.

39
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,489
-Please.
-Are you two all right?

40
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:51,195
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we're okay.

41
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:54,662
The elevator crashed
just as we got out of the doors.

42
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,264
-Sounded like the cable broke.
-How?

43
00:03:57,903 --> 00:03:59,632
I don't know, Chloe.

44
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:01,796
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

45
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,299
Thank you.

46
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,674
Alicia, hold on!

47
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,312
I didn't get a chance
to thank you yesterday.

48
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,278
Oh, it was my pleasure.

49
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:22,477
It was actually kind of a relief to be able
to share my ability with someone.

50
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:26,885
Is that what it takes
to be friends with you?

51
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,291
I guess I deserved that.

52
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:33,829
I'm not really as stuck-up
as everyone thinks.

53
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:38,430
What, you think I don't know
what people say about me?

54
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,272
It doesn't bother you, huh?

55
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,203
I'm always so afraid that if I get
too close to people...

56
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:49,336
...they'll find out about me,
realize that I'm a freak.

57
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:54,919
I just figure it's better to be alone,
even if people think I'm a snob.

58
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:59,721
You don't mind if I ask....
Have you always been able to...?

59
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,489
No. It was the meteor shower.

60
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:07,826
One minute I was swinging on the swing set,
next I'm in the middle of a corn field.

61
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,592
Do you know how it happened?

62
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:13,602
Sort of. I mean, once I was old enough
to realize I was different...

63
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:17,833
...I did some research and--
Thank you.

64
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:24,274
I don't know. There's a complicated
explanation about quantum physics.

65
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,544
-You'd probably be bored.
-No.

66
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,957
Try me.

67
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:38,291
Basically, the meteor shower
affected my body...

68
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,592
...and allowed me to teleport myself.

69
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:43,834
And anything you touch.

70
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:48,500
And anything I touch
I want to take with me. Yes.

71
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,113
What about you?
Was it meteor eXposure too?

72
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:03,479
Everything's pretty much connected
to the meteor shower.

73
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:05,122
Right?

74
00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:07,448
Right.

75
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,522
I just can't believe you're like me.

76
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,725
I mean, not eXactly like me, but just...

77
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:21,433
...Iike me.

78
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,631
You know?

79
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:26,670
Yeah. I do.

80
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:31,782
Bye.

81
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:42,551
Adam?

82
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,597
Lana.

83
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,262
What are you doing?

84
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,232
-Adam, what is this?
-It's private. Give it back to me.

85
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,067
No.

86
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,606
"January 1 1 th. Lana evasive
about her relationship with Clark.

87
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:41,745
January 1 7th. Clark is at the scene
of another accident."

88
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:46,251
You've been spying on me,
and you've been spying on Clark.

89
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,892
Look who's talking.

90
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,156
No, you threatened me, and now I find out
you've been keeping tabs on me?

91
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,492
I want you to leave.

92
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,140
Guess you haven't checked tenant laws.

93
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,413
It's not that easy to evict someone.

94
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:13,242
I'm not going anywhere.

95
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:29,529
Alicia.

96
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:31,467
Hey.

97
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:33,568
I've been looking all over for you.

98
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,299
Yeah, you figured teleporting girl,
physics lab.

99
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,740
It makes sense.
That's a pretty good deduction.

100
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,805
But I should warn you, Clark,
I'm not always that easy to pin down.

101
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,644
So I've seen.

102
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:52,817
But since I've been this lucky...

103
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,391
...I was just wondering if you'd like...

104
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:58,828
...to get together,
you know, for the econ test.

105
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,365
Are you asking me out on a date?

106
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:06,369
A date? No.

107
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,735
Not that I wouldn't, but....

108
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:11,773
Clark...

109
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:15,371
...would you like to go out
on a date with me?

110
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,653
Did you just win the lotto?

111
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,325
What?

112
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:37,193
No, it's just-- I haven't seen you
smile like that in a long time.

113
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:42,370
Look, l-- I don't want to spoil your mood...

114
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,601
...but I wanted to tell you
something about Adam.

115
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,842
What is it?

116
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:52,583
He's been keeping a journal about me.

117
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:57,955
And you. And I don't know if it's because
he's jealous or he's obsessed with us...

118
00:10:58,123 --> 00:10:59,886
...or if....

119
00:11:00,058 --> 00:11:02,026
If it's more about you.

120
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:06,289
-Well, I'll go talk to him.
-Clark, no, I'm gonna have him evicted.

121
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:10,196
I don't think he'll bother
either of us anymore. I just...

122
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,496
...wanted to give you a heads up.

123
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,364
See you at 7?

124
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:22,742
Hey, Lana.

125
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,278
We're in the same econ class.

126
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:45,401
According to the Greeks...

127
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:51,600
...Orion the Hunter is greater in strength
and stature than any other mortal.

128
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,111
I thought I was the only one
who knew astronomy.

129
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,747
I'm a science geek.

130
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,080
You don't look like one.

131
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,154
Thanks.

132
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:12,023
So I spent the whole movie wondering
what else you can do...

133
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:14,688
...other than punch through steel.

134
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,201
What do you mean?

135
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:22,438
Come on, Clark.

136
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:27,306
I know you managed to fry
that security camera. I just....

137
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:31,210
I can't figure out eXactly how.

138
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,920
With my eyes. They give off heat.

139
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:43,222
That's incredible.

140
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,128
Have you ever shown Lana
what you can do?

141
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,994
No.

142
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,203
It's actually one of our issues. I didn't feel
I could be completely honest with her.

143
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,037
Like you are with me?

144
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:10,820
So how about you?

145
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,423
Any boyfriends or...?

146
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:17,056
There was this boy,
and I really liked him...

147
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:23,458
...but then he found out what I can do,
and he totally freaked.

148
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:29,306
What he thought...

149
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:31,608
...doesn't matter.

150
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,240
Looks like someone stayed up.
I hope they didn't worry.

151
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,338
Yeah, my parents are a little...

152
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:08,001
...overprotective.

153
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:09,441
Really?

154
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:14,142
Yeah, they don't really understand
everything about my abilities.

155
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,648
For a while, they tried
to keep me from doing it.

156
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:20,620
How?

157
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,491
I don't really want to talk about it.

158
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:27,962
Okay.

159
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,599
What about your parents?

160
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,794
My parents are great.

161
00:14:33,972 --> 00:14:38,272
They worry about me, that someone might
find out, but they don't try to change me.

162
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:43,807
Well, maybe that's why you're so special.

163
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:48,913
Clark...

164
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:53,021
...I just want you to know...

165
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:55,751
...that I had a really good time tonight.

166
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:57,189
Me too.

167
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,859
Yeah.

168
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:19,139
Okay.

169
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:25,984
I guess....

170
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:27,988
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

171
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,854
Okay.

172
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:27,179
Alicia.

173
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:30,753
Sorry. I didn't want to scare you. I just...

174
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:34,517
-...wanted to surprise you.
-What are you doing here?

175
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:38,720
When you dropped me off, I could tell
that you didn't want the night to end...

176
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:42,632
...and neither did l, so....

177
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,307
Alicia, l....

178
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,901
I know you wanted to kiss me, Clark.

179
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,877
-Alicia....
-Just kiss me.

180
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,006
Hey, what'd you do, fall out of--?

181
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,440
Dad.

182
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,791
I don't know, Martha, it's what we've
always discussed. We have rules...

183
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:46,453
...boundaries, limitations.

184
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:49,191
Clark knows that. I don't understand--

185
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:51,631
Jonathan.

186
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,339
She's gone.

187
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,305
What did she do, Clark,
climb out the window?

188
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,836
Actually, she teleported out.

189
00:18:01,012 --> 00:18:04,140
You're gonna have to run that
by me one more time.

190
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,619
Alicia was infected by the meteor shower.

191
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,121
She can transport herself
wherever she wants.

192
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,691
Including boys' bedrooms.

193
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:18,686
Look, Alicia saved me.

194
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:22,264
We were trapped in the LuthorCorp
elevator, and the cable broke...

195
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:25,027
...and I had to stop it.

196
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,971
So Alicia saw you use your powers?

197
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,805
Yes.

198
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:34,478
How much does she know
about you, Clark?

199
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:37,172
She knows about the strength...

200
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:45,316
...and the heat vision.

201
00:18:46,257 --> 00:18:50,717
I suppose the next thing you'll tell us is she
knows you get sick around meteor rocks.

202
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:52,863
No, I didn't tell her that.

203
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,268
She didn't have to help me.

204
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:03,532
She was willing to expose
her own secret to protect mine...

205
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:07,236
...and I think that's why I feel
such a connection to her.

206
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:11,444
Look, you guys don't get this.

207
00:19:12,116 --> 00:19:14,277
We're a lot alike.

208
00:19:15,386 --> 00:19:17,911
You really like this girl,
don't you, honey?

209
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:19,488
Maybe I do.

210
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:25,024
I think I found someone I could
actually have a relationship with.

211
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:35,463
Clark, I know we've had
our differences lately.

212
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:40,608
-But I can't believe you didn't tell me.
-Tell you what?

213
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:44,441
That your dad caught you and Alicia
in your bedroom, that's what.

214
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,077
The only people who knew about that
were me, my parents and Alicia.

215
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,847
Well, I guess she's not
as secretive as you are.

216
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:55,117
Anyway, man, that girl is on fire.

217
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:57,625
Congratulations.

218
00:19:58,029 --> 00:19:59,758
Later, stud.

219
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:01,796
Yeah.

220
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:16,644
Good morning, gorgeous.

221
00:20:16,814 --> 00:20:19,476
Alicia. Look, we need to talk.

222
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:21,374
What's wrong?

223
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:25,113
Well, last night in my room,
and these pictures....

224
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:26,756
Don't you like them?

225
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:29,989
No, I do. It's just....

226
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:34,029
I just think we're moving a little too fast.

227
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:43,367
You said you had a great time last night.

228
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,267
You kissed me.

229
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,845
No....

230
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:52,743
I did, and I did.

231
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:58,348
I just think that maybe
we need to set some boundaries...

232
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:01,048
...you know, maybe some limitations.

233
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:03,693
We're special, Clark.

234
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:09,794
People like us don't have
boundaries and limitations.

235
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:13,865
I'll see you later, sweetie.

236
00:21:15,873 --> 00:21:17,363
Yeah.

237
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:20,676
I'll be thinking about you.

238
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:25,442
You go on one date with this girl...

239
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:28,210
...and already she's sneaking
into your bedroom...

240
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:31,150
...putting sexy pictures
of herself in your locker...

241
00:21:31,322 --> 00:21:34,553
...practically asking her parents
to book the wedding chapel.

242
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,694
What's your secret, Clark?

243
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:40,057
This isn't funny, LeX.

244
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:44,397
We barely know each other.
She's already acting like we're soul mates.

245
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:48,369
Look, in my experience, a person doesn't
develop this kind of fixation...

246
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:52,134
...unless she's been led to think
the relationship is more than just casual.

247
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,405
You're saying I led her on.

248
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,672
I'm saying I've been there.

249
00:21:59,183 --> 00:22:03,085
She's smart, she's pretty,
and you want her to like you...

250
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:05,722
...so you tell her things
she wants to hear.

251
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:09,923
I'm curious. What exactly did you do
to make her feel this way?

252
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:17,192
You're making my point for me.

253
00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:27,640
So, what do I do now?

254
00:22:36,854 --> 00:22:39,880
You must be Clark. Come in, come in.

255
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,083
Alicia's not here right now.

256
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,225
Honey.

257
00:22:44,762 --> 00:22:46,992
Look who's here. It's Clark.

258
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,360
Clark.

259
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:52,699
She's-- She's told us so much about you...

260
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:57,136
...and, well, we're just thrilled
that's she's dating such a nice young man.

261
00:22:57,408 --> 00:23:02,107
Actually, that's why I'm here.
I think she has the wrong idea about us.

262
00:23:02,613 --> 00:23:07,175
No, I'm pretty sure that you're mistaken.

263
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:10,445
-She said you're her boyfriend.
-That's the thing. I'm--

264
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:13,146
No, if she says you're dating...

265
00:23:13,324 --> 00:23:15,315
...well, just go along with it.

266
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,125
Alicia's a special girl.

267
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:23,589
I know about Alicia. Her ability....

268
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,630
She said you tried to stop her
from using it. How?

269
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:33,636
We kept her in a special room.

270
00:23:33,811 --> 00:23:36,541
But she begged us to let her out.

271
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:39,274
She promised she wouldn't
abuse her power.

272
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:43,045
Now we never know where she is
or what she'll do.

273
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:47,388
Please, Clark, just try
to go along with her.

274
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:50,993
If you see Alicia,
please tell her I'm looking for her.

275
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:53,725
Clark.

276
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:00,901
There was another boy
that Alicia liked a lot.

277
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,040
It didn't end well.

278
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:05,639
Be careful.

279
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:14,917
Alicia.

280
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,479
You shouldn't have said that, Daddy.

281
00:24:24,695 --> 00:24:28,028
I'm sorry to bother you with this,
but I didn't know where else to turn.

282
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:31,134
It's all right, Lana.
I trust your instincts.

283
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:35,295
Look, if you're nervous about Adam,
I'm sure it's with good reason.

284
00:24:35,673 --> 00:24:38,005
Is there anything concrete
you can tell me?

285
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:43,478
No, not really. Just the journal
that I told you about and his attitude.

286
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:47,915
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

287
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,581
I checked the laws...

288
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,985
...and it can take up
to six months to get him out...

289
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:55,785
...and I'm not willing to wait that long.

290
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,191
Believe me, there are definitely ways
of getting rid of someone...

291
00:24:59,363 --> 00:25:01,024
...a lot faster than that.

292
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,751
-Hey.
-Alicia.

293
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:31,595
What's going on?

294
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:34,788
I got your message.
My parents said you wanted to see me.

295
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,797
So here I am.

296
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:40,904
Well, that wasn't an invitation
to redecorate or to go through my stuff.

297
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:44,303
I thought you'd like what I did
to the loft. It's--

298
00:25:44,475 --> 00:25:46,739
It's more us now.

299
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:49,541
What's this all about?

300
00:25:49,747 --> 00:25:52,648
Clark, it's time to move on.

301
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:56,480
I know you used to go out with Lana,
but now you're with me.

302
00:25:58,055 --> 00:25:59,852
There's no us.

303
00:26:00,024 --> 00:26:02,288
Of course there is.

304
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,057
We're special.

305
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,756
We're made for each other.

306
00:26:07,064 --> 00:26:09,897
You didn't tell Lana your secret.
You told me.

307
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:18,198
You and I are meant to be together.

308
00:26:26,717 --> 00:26:27,843
Hello.

309
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,810
Yes.

310
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:35,524
It's my father.

311
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:38,290
He's at the hospital.

312
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,421
He fell down the stairs.

313
00:26:58,215 --> 00:26:59,910
Miss Baker...

314
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:02,380
...may I have a word?

315
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,156
What is it?

316
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:11,728
Can you think of anyone
who would want to hurt your father?

317
00:27:13,364 --> 00:27:14,956
I thought it was an accident.

318
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,998
There was a suspicious-looking
blunt trauma...

319
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,866
...to the back of Mr. Baker's head.

320
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:24,670
It's possible there was an assailant.

321
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,172
Possible?

322
00:27:27,745 --> 00:27:30,043
The basement was locked from the inside.

323
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:35,213
I'm sorry.

324
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,515
It's fine.

325
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:48,057
Alicia, listen to me.

326
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:50,860
I need to know. Did you have
anything to do with this?

327
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:53,833
How could you think that?

328
00:27:54,004 --> 00:27:56,700
Who else could escape
from a locked basement?

329
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,149
I did it for us.

330
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,054
He was trying to keep us apart.

331
00:28:16,927 --> 00:28:18,622
You need to talk to the sheriff.

332
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,925
No.

333
00:28:36,113 --> 00:28:38,547
Clark. Hi.

334
00:28:39,483 --> 00:28:42,577
I stopped by to see you, and your mom
asked me to stay for dinner.

335
00:28:45,322 --> 00:28:46,949
What are you doing here?

336
00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:49,524
I'm just getting to know your family.

337
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:51,388
You need to turn yourself in.

338
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,829
You're my boyfriend.

339
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:57,957
You're supposed to be protecting me.
Like I protected you.

340
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:05,241
As long as you do that,
your secret's safe.

341
00:29:05,943 --> 00:29:09,470
-And so are the people you care about.
-ls that a threat?

342
00:29:15,686 --> 00:29:18,416
Tell your mom I'm sorry I couldn't stay.

343
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,890
I'm really sorry she
went all Glenn Close on you.

344
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:30,295
I should've told you about Alicia's ability
before, but she asked me to keep it secret.

345
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:33,265
Yeah, and I respect you
for keeping her confidence...

346
00:29:33,437 --> 00:29:36,895
...but once she went psycho,
all bets are off.

347
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:42,742
So how do you look for someone
who can disappear in the blink of an eye?

348
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,281
Well...

349
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:49,781
...we know that Alicia has
at least one weakness.

350
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:52,521
You.

351
00:29:55,826 --> 00:29:57,919
She may have one more.

352
00:29:58,095 --> 00:30:00,290
Chloe, I have an idea.

353
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:02,360
I'm gonna need your help.

354
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:08,829
Mrs. Baker? I'm Chloe Sullivan.
I need to speak with Alicia, please.

355
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:11,736
-It's urgent.
-What's wrong?

356
00:30:11,942 --> 00:30:14,843
It's her boyfriend, Clark. He's in trouble.

357
00:30:15,746 --> 00:30:17,646
What do you mean?

358
00:30:23,754 --> 00:30:25,187
What is it?

359
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:29,391
Sheriff Adams suspects he may have had
something to do with your father's accident.

360
00:30:30,227 --> 00:30:32,661
-Alicia--
-Mother.

361
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,900
Why would the sheriff suspect Clark?

362
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:50,242
She has this theory that Clark was angry
with your father...

363
00:30:50,414 --> 00:30:52,575
...for not allowing you guys
to be together.

364
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,183
Is he under arrest?

365
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,315
No, he's in hiding.

366
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:59,081
He asked me to find you
and tell you he needs help.

367
00:30:59,256 --> 00:31:01,622
I don't understand why...

368
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:04,454
...but he said you were his only chance.

369
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:12,392
Where is he now?

370
00:31:21,111 --> 00:31:22,942
Clark?

371
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,183
Clark?

372
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:43,461
Alicia?

373
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,463
Clark, are you okay?

374
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:51,096
They're after me. The sheriff thinks
I tried to kill your father.

375
00:31:51,508 --> 00:31:53,135
I know.

376
00:31:54,144 --> 00:31:58,046
-You have to tell them the truth.
-No, I can't do that.

377
00:31:59,283 --> 00:32:00,750
Alicia....

378
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,448
-We'll disappear.
-What?

379
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,987
We'll go somewhere
where no one will find us.

380
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:16,027
Yeah. I guess that's the only way.

381
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,203
Come on.

382
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:32,343
Quick, someone's coming. Come on.

383
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:49,255
Lead paint?

384
00:32:51,268 --> 00:32:53,600
Are you trying to trap me...

385
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:58,002
...Iike my parents did, in that little room?

386
00:32:58,175 --> 00:33:00,700
Alicia, what you did
to your father was wrong.

387
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:04,645
You're just trying to get me out
of the way so you can be with Lana.

388
00:33:04,848 --> 00:33:07,043
Alicia, you need help.

389
00:33:07,217 --> 00:33:09,947
Don't you understand?

390
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:14,048
I'm the one that's right for you.

391
00:33:14,224 --> 00:33:16,055
No, I'm sorry.

392
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:18,754
The police are already on their way.

393
00:33:19,663 --> 00:33:21,995
Just because I can't teleport
out of this room...

394
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,396
...doesn't mean that I can't walk out.

395
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:37,374
I overheard you talking to your parents.

396
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:41,780
I hoped that I wouldn't have to use it,
but you broke the rules first.

397
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,682
Please.

398
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:47,255
Alicia, don't do this.

399
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:51,350
Come here.

400
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,460
Once Lana's out of the way...

401
00:33:55,632 --> 00:33:58,829
...you'll realize we
were meant to be together.

402
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,477
We can still be great together, Clark.

403
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:12,604
We're soul mates,
and nothing can stop that.

404
00:34:22,392 --> 00:34:24,622
What is it about you, Lana?

405
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:26,285
EXcuse me?

406
00:34:26,463 --> 00:34:29,830
What is it that Clark Kent is so in love with?

407
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,460
I mean, what have you got
that I haven't got?

408
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:37,040
I have no idea what you're talking about.

409
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:44,738
I think you do.

410
00:34:59,296 --> 00:35:01,628
Tell me, Lana.

411
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:04,893
What's your secret?

412
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:10,997
You're not prettier than I am.

413
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,873
And you're definitely not smarter.

414
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:25,185
And you certainly
don't have my abilities.

415
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:29,317
Alicia, there is nothing going on
between me and Clark.

416
00:35:32,863 --> 00:35:34,694
Oh, yes, there is...

417
00:35:34,865 --> 00:35:38,392
...because Clark is still in love with you.

418
00:35:39,469 --> 00:35:41,596
But now it's my turn.

419
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:46,906
He told me the truth about himself.

420
00:35:48,612 --> 00:35:50,876
The things that he wouldn't tell you.

421
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,115
And now you'll never know.

422
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:37,117
Alicia!

423
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:17,292
Lana. Lana.

424
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:18,966
Clark.

425
00:37:21,004 --> 00:37:22,995
Why, Clark?

426
00:37:23,173 --> 00:37:25,004
Why?

427
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:35,483
-Hey.
-Hi.

428
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:39,146
-Can I come in?
-Yeah, come on in.

429
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,016
I just wanted to thank you.

430
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:48,590
You know, I think I should apologize.

431
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:53,828
-lf I never got involved with Alicia--
-Alicia said that you....

432
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:56,529
You told her the truth about yourself.

433
00:37:58,475 --> 00:38:01,035
Stuff you never told me.

434
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,806
What did she mean by that?

435
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,984
You know, Alicia said
a lot of crazy things.

436
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:14,617
She also said that you
were still in love with me.

437
00:38:15,525 --> 00:38:19,655
But that was crazy too, right?

438
00:38:22,766 --> 00:38:24,233
Right.

439
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:29,433
Lana, hi.

440
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:33,773
Would you like to stay for dinner?

441
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:37,175
Thanks, Mrs. Kent, but....

442
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:41,281
But I can't.

443
00:38:42,786 --> 00:38:45,380
-Well, bye.
-Bye.

444
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:59,027
Clark, honey, someday, you'll find
the person who's right for you.

445
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:09,269
For a while, I thought that person was Lana,
but I could never be honest with her.

446
00:39:09,446 --> 00:39:12,244
And then I thought it was Alicia
because she was like me--

447
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:16,750
Sweetheart, there's nobody
like you. You're....

448
00:39:21,725 --> 00:39:24,319
Maybe that means I'll always be alone.

449
00:39:34,237 --> 00:39:37,138
Hello? Adam?

450
00:39:42,112 --> 00:39:44,273
Lana.

451
00:39:46,716 --> 00:39:48,843
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

452
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,987
They told me you were up here.

453
00:39:51,154 --> 00:39:54,954
Lex, thank you. I feel like
this huge burden's been lifted.

454
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,786
What do you mean?

455
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,757
Well, Adam's gone.

456
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:01,397
I really appreciate your help.

457
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:05,558
Lana, as much as I'd like to take credit
for getting him out of your life...

458
00:40:05,735 --> 00:40:07,430
...I can't.

459
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:11,072
My security people haven't been able
to track him down.

460
00:40:11,241 --> 00:40:14,733
Well, if you didn't get rid of him,
then where is he?

461
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,221
Adam.

462
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,330
Hello?

463
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,560
Why did I send you to Smallville?

464
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:43,032
To become the best friend of Lana Lang.

465
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:47,842
To find out everything she knew
about Clark Kent. Wasn't that it?

466
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:54,047
Instead, you have alienated her completely.

467
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,979
Mr. Luthor, his medication is ready.

468
00:40:57,287 --> 00:40:59,949
That won't be necessary, Dr. Teng.

469
00:41:00,557 --> 00:41:04,323
-He needs the serum, or he'll die.
-I'm sorry. I've already made my decision.

470
00:41:04,494 --> 00:41:08,055
This patient is no longer a participant
in our research program.

471
00:41:14,337 --> 00:41:15,599
Help me.

472
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,435
Please.

473
00:41:21,144 --> 00:41:22,611
Help me.

474
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,914
No!

475
00:41:32,355 --> 00:41:33,617
No.

476
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,088
No!

477
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,059
Help me!

478
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,255
Help me!

479
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
