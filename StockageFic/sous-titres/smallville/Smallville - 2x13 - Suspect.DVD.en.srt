1
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:11,075
That which is done out of love
always takes place beyond good and evil.

2
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,486
Yeah. Have my helicopter ready
first thing in the morning.

3
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:28,627
I'm going back to Metropolis.

4
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:32,026
No, no, I'll be alone. I suspect...

5
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:36,100
...Martha Kent is no longer in my employ.

6
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:47,837
Who's there?

7
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:53,018
If this is someone's idea of a joke,
I'm not amused.

8
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,385
Is that you?

9
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,023
Didn't I make it clear,
the conversation is over.

10
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,319
Jonathan Kent...

11
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,053
...put the gun down
and step out of the truck.

12
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,428
Keep your hands where I can see them.

13
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,030
Drop it.

14
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,026
Away from the vehicle, sir.

15
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,795
Away from the vehicle!

16
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:28,277
Everything's gonna be fine. Just keep
your hands where we can see them.

17
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,311
Ethan.

18
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,214
- What's going on?
- Jonathan...

19
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:38,881
...as a friend, don't say another word
until you get yourself a lawyer.

20
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,763
You have the right to remain silent
and refuse to answer questions.

21
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,665
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

22
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,934
You have the right to consult an attorney
and to have an attorney present...

23
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,566
Dad, how are you doing?

24
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,903
I'm fine, other than a splitting headache.

25
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,942
Any word on how Lionel Luthor's doing?

26
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:09,707
He was rushed into surgery, Jonathan.
He may not make it.

27
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,578
How about the gun they found
in my truck?

28
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:16,449
Well, the police are testing it now.
It's the same caliber Lionel was shot with.

29
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,784
Clark, that was not my gun.

30
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,324
I have no idea how it wound up
in my hands.

31
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:26,694
- Dad, what happened last night?
- Well, I was out running some errands.

32
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,164
I stopped by the Wild Coyote for a beer.

33
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,837
When I got in my truck,
everything started to go woozy on me.

34
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,042
How many did you have?

35
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,806
Martha, I had half a beer.

36
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,974
I promise, but...

37
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,613
...next thing I know, I'm out on the side
of Highway 91. I got...

38
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,484
...the police spotlight shining
in my face, it's raining.

39
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:55,924
We need to get a lawyer. I'm going to call
my father and ask him to take your case.

40
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:59,963
Martha, that man has never believed
in me before. I don't see why...

41
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,034
...an attempted-murder charge
is gonna change that.

42
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,595
Well, Lana told me Henry Small
used to be a criminal attorney.

43
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:12,069
Well, he certainly wouldn't be
intimidated by the Luthors.

44
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:17,080
Sorry, Martha, but you and Clark
are gonna have to leave now.

45
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:31,386
Dad, no matter what it takes,
I'm gonna find out who did this.

46
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,891
Yeah.

47
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,775
I just got in from Metropolis.
Where is he?

48
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:57,047
In surgery. He's still in critical condition.

49
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:01,284
If the downstairs maid hadn't been
awakened by the shot, he'd be dead.

50
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,919
I want round-the-clock security.
Whoever shot him might still be out there.

51
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:09,000
You can save the concerned-son routine,
Lex. I have everything under control.

52
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:15,800
The loyal lap dog sitting watch at master's
door, secretly hoping he doesn't make it?

53
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:20,207
As I recall, you almost let him die once.

54
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,814
Who's to say you didn't
try to finish the job?

55
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,742
God knows, after yesterday...

56
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,245
...you'd have enough reason
to want him dead.

57
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:36,158
You know what I find so amusing, is you
actually believe my father is grooming you.

58
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,128
It's unfortunate that they already
have a suspect in custody.

59
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:51,268
I can't think of a person with a better
motive for killing your father than you.

60
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,217
I'm sorry about your father, Clark,
but I'm afraid I can't represent him.

61
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,379
I don't understand. Why?

62
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,821
I'm not the right man for this case.

63
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,019
From everything I know about you,
you're perfect for this case.

64
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,790
- I can make some referrals.
- They don't need a list of names.

65
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,694
They need someone they can trust.

66
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,698
I'm sorry, Lana.

67
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,369
My decision's final.

68
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,338
Just when I thought I was
getting to know him.

69
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,744
Looks like we need to find another lawyer.

70
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,346
Clark...

71
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,014
...there's something I have to tell you.

72
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:45,125
I went by the mansion yesterday to drop off
the Talon's quarterly tax bills, and...

73
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,026
...your dad was there.

74
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,196
What was he doing?

75
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,359
Yelling at Lionel Luthor.

76
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,903
No, I want you out of our lives,
once and for all.

77
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:58,100
You're jumping to conclusions, Mr. Kent.
It was simply a token of appreciation.

78
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,245
I think it was quite a bit more than that.

79
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,176
It's all relative, isn't it?

80
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:06,011
I mean, a Roger Dubuis watch
from me is equivalent...

81
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,380
...to a Whitman's Sampler from you.

82
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,050
Condescending son of a...

83
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,683
The worst thing that happened to my family
was getting involved with yours.

84
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:20,959
Oh, now, I seem to recall that the benefits
to our families were mutual.

85
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,795
Are you forgetting the circumstances
of Clark's adoption?

86
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,932
You poison everything you touch.

87
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,537
This town would be better off
if you weren't in it.

88
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,144
But you're as much to blame for that
as I am, aren't you?

89
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,310
Martha was worried about that.

90
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:40,316
She thought you wouldn't be big enough
to let her live her own life.

91
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,545
You stay away from Martha...

92
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,486
...or I promise you, you will regret it.

93
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,686
He threatened him, Clark.

94
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:53,289
My dad told me he was running errands.
Why would he lie to me?

95
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,629
Look, the sheriff came by earlier...

96
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,336
...I told him what I just told you.

97
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,404
I didn't want to, but I couldn't lie.

98
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,509
It's okay. I mean, you know my dad
would never try to kill anybody.

99
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,011
Right?

100
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:13,618
He was angry, Clark, but I know him.
And there's no way.

101
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,754
Thanks.

102
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,234
Mom?

103
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,238
What's going on?

104
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,441
They have a search warrant.

105
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,546
- Martha, can I have a word with you?
- Yeah.

106
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,185
Found this watch on your bedroom floor.
Is it yours?

107
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,879
It was a gift.

108
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,284
From who?

109
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,363
Lionel Luthor.

110
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:06,671
"To Martha, with deepest affection, L.L."

111
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,500
I was gonna give it back.

112
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,170
I knew if Jonathan saw it,
he would be furious...

113
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,679
...so I hid it in my dresser.
- Well, looks like he found it.

114
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:22,244
Ethan, you've known Jonathan
since high school.

115
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:25,022
I can't let my friendship
interfere with my job.

116
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:30,485
- You gotta admit, this looks like motive.
- He found a watch and smashed it.

117
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,153
That doesn't mean he's a killer.

118
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,166
He also had an argument
with Lionel yesterday.

119
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,234
- What?
- Yeah.

120
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,836
Lana was there. She saw it.

121
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:43,032
It was so heated, one of Lionel's assistants
called about getting a restraining order.

122
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,941
Way I figure, he was still hot under the
collar when he got to the Wild Coyote.

123
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,877
Bartender told me he got pretty drunk.

124
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,251
Hey, Mike...

125
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,052
...why don't you give me a double shot
of that tequila?

126
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,030
Wait a minute, Dad said
he only had one beer.

127
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,797
I administered his blood-alcohol
test myself, son.

128
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,043
He was at 2.0.

129
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,577
That's quite a bit more than one beer.

130
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,848
From the sound of things,
he was really spoiling for a fight.

131
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,146
Lionel Luthor's a lying, miserable
son of a bitch.

132
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,989
You won't get any arguments here.

133
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,930
- Again.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

134
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,999
All right, then why don't you
sell me the whole bottle.

135
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:52,574
- I'm not supposed to do that, Jonathan.
- Come on, Mike.

136
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,940
I know we've been friends a long time.

137
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:57,843
Nobody's gonna know.

138
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,278
Is that you?

139
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:38,051
Didn't I make it clear?
The conversation is over.

140
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,335
We have eyewitnesses...

141
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,915
...who saw Jonathan's truck leaving
the mansion after they heard gunshots.

142
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,049
Forensics found powder residue
on Jonathan's hand.

143
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,189
I wish there were another explanation.

144
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,857
But now he's our only suspect.

145
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,035
What exactly are we looking for?

146
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,898
The police already checked this whole area.

147
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,737
Yeah, we have an advantage they don't.

148
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,946
Are you doing the eye thing?

149
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,450
Hey, I need you to check
my back yard sometime.

150
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,919
I buried a jar of quarters when I was 10.
Never could find it.

151
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,786
They found my dad's truck
right about here.

152
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,936
Did you find something?

153
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,541
Yeah, it's a bullet.

154
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,272
We need to get the sheriff
out here to dig it out.

155
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,648
I don't mean to rain on
your CSI parade...

156
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,720
...but the only thing that proves
is that somebody shot a shed.

157
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:20,256
The sheriff said he found powder residue
on my dad's hand.

158
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,860
My dad said he'd never
seen that gun before.

159
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,825
So? What does that mean?

160
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:28,626
Whoever shot Lionel drugged my dad
and followed him until he pulled over.

161
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,206
If that bullet came from the gun
that shot Lionel...

162
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,902
...maybe we can convince the police
that my dad is being framed.

163
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:52,051
Even though we removed the bullet,
the kidney damage slowed his metabolism.

164
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,953
He's in a coma.

165
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,354
What are his chances?

166
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,688
His higher brain functions
are shutting down.

167
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,928
If he doesn't regain consciousness
in the next 24 hours...

168
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,126
...he won't make it. I'm sorry.

169
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,838
Sheriff Ethan...

170
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,375
...can I talk to you for a minute?
- Excuse me, sheriff.

171
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,476
What is it, Clark?

172
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,746
I found a bullet in the shack
where you arrested my father.

173
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,281
My men went over that area
with a microscope.

174
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,150
Well, they must have missed it.

175
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,885
Someone put that gun in my dad's hand
and fired it.

176
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,996
Or he squeezed off a round while he was
parked there drinking...

177
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,132
...or it could be from a different weapon.

178
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,565
Whoever's trying to set up my dad
doesn't want you to find that bullet.

179
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,432
I don't know what it'll prove,
but I'll have it tested.

180
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,507
Sheriff, I was wondering if we could talk.

181
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,474
My name's Dominic Santori.
I work for Lionel Luthor.

182
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,009
- Clark, would you excuse us?
- It's okay. He can stay.

183
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,184
I don't think his father shot Mr. Luthor.

184
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,456
But I'm pretty sure I know who did.

185
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,450
All right, Lex...

186
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,961
...what's so urgent that you insisted
I fly in for a face-to-face.

187
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,292
I'm missing Domingo's La Boheme.

188
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,865
Well, consider this a curtain call
on our own private opera, Dad.

189
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,103
Would you ask your Seeing Eye dog
to wait outside?

190
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:20,538
Anything you have to say,
you can say in front of Dominic.

191
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,508
A representative from
an offshore shell company...

192
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,884
...who bears an uncanny resemblance
to Mr. Santori here...

193
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:32,888
...has been quietly approaching LexCorp
employees and buying their voting shares.

194
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,193
Is that so?

195
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,259
I was under the impression
they had no intention of selling.

196
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,659
What'd you get on them?

197
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,631
Now, now, Lex, don't be a sore loser.

198
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,370
I'm just realigning your priorities.

199
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:50,133
Your attempt to build LexCorp
was at the expense of our mutual goals.

200
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,712
The only thing we share
is a mutual enmity.

201
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:02,153
This father-son reconciliation act was just
a smoke screen to buy out my company.

202
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:06,451
If you were ready to run LexCorp, there's
no way I could have taken it from you.

203
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:11,191
Look at this as an opportunity for us
to work together again, father and son.

204
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,264
When I broke away, I swore I'd
never be under your thumb again.

205
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,869
It was my hope that you'll stay
and rise to the challenge.

206
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,001
Your ego wouldn't allow it.

207
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,037
I'll fight you on this, and I'll win.

208
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,699
You better have something stronger
than words to back up those threats...

209
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:30,611
...because as of this moment,
you are just another employee.

210
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:38,053
All Lex had to do
was wait until Lionel was alone.

211
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,952
Didn't I make it clear?
The conversation is over.

212
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:53,699
After he shot him,
Lex could have framed Mr. Kent.

213
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:58,707
And then he drove his girlfriend
to Metropolis, a convenient alibi.

214
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,445
Thank you, Mr. Santori.
I'll certainly look into that.

215
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,582
Excuse me.

216
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,577
I know Lex and his dad have problems,
but it's hard to believe he'd do that.

217
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,551
Face it, Clark, in your heart...

218
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,750
...you've always known
what Lex is capable of.

219
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,377
Hey.

220
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,109
Are you okay?

221
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:43,381
Sometimes being an objective journalist
really sucks.

222
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,656
I can imagine.

223
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,459
I still can't believe
Henry didn't take Mr. Kent's case.

224
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:56,629
Okay, usually when I do this,
people seem to get really mad at me.

225
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,636
But I found it odd that your dad passed up
an opportunity to take on a Luthor...

226
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,298
...so I ran a search on his legal history.

227
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:08,308
And since you don't seem to be
freaking out, I guess I should continue?

228
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:12,645
If it helps explain why he won't
defend Mr. Kent, then I wanna know.

229
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:19,018
Okay, it turns out that Mr. Small was
a top white-collar criminal defense lawyer.

230
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:24,125
He and his firm did a lot of business
with, surprise, surprise, LuthorCorp.

231
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,657
Maybe he considered the Kent case
a conflict of interest.

232
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:31,500
As opposed to all the other times
he's taken on Lionel and his buddies?

233
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,537
This is interesting, though.

234
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:39,405
LuthorCorp filed a complaint against
Henry Small that got him fired from his firm.

235
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,103
Okay, so that explains why
he might hate the Luthors...

236
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,681
...but it doesn't explain
why he won't take the case.

237
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,877
You know, Lana, my computer
only spits out cold, hard facts.

238
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,990
If you want explanations,
you're gonna have to go to the source.

239
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,324
I understand.

240
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,852
Very well, doctor, keep me posted.

241
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:03,163
Dominic told me you got in a fight
with your father before he got shot.

242
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,132
Why didn't you tell the police?

243
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,698
So now you're implying I pulled the trigger?

244
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,533
It's not like I haven't seen you
shoot someone before.

245
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,705
Get out of here before you
say something you'll regret.

246
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,475
I'm not going anywhere,
not until I get some answers.

247
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,277
Are you trying to frame my dad?

248
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:25,717
After all this time, I thought you knew me
better than the average tabloid reader.

249
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,519
If you don't start trusting me,
what else am I to think?

250
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,218
Stay out of it, Clark.

251
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:34,422
- My dad's life is at stake here.
- So is my father's!

252
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,433
Goodbye, Clark.

253
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,362
Sweetheart...

254
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,089
...how are you holding up?

255
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:13,202
You know, it's funny
how being locked up can...

256
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,432
...give you time to reflect
on all the mistakes you've made.

257
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,934
Why didn't you tell me
you had a fight with Lionel?

258
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,146
- Because I was angry.
- At me?

259
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,811
No, at myself.

260
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,145
I was jealous.

261
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,617
When I found that watch...

262
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,488
...it reminded me of all the things
I couldn't give you.

263
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,563
For the first time,
it felt like I was losing you.

264
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,461
Martha, I am so sorry.

265
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,363
For what?

266
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,047
I'm sorry for not having faith in us.

267
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:03,218
I'm sorry for giving in to my own petty fears.

268
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,851
And all it takes is one...

269
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,788
...reckless moment to ruin everything.

270
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,690
Jonathan, you didn't shoot Lionel.

271
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,096
No, I didn't shoot Lionel.

272
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,070
But I...

273
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,668
I let my anger get the best of me.

274
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:29,246
I haven't exactly kept it a secret how
Jonathan Kent feels about the Luthors.

275
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,276
What jury could possibly believe me now?

276
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,516
I know this place.

277
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:45,424
My brother used to come here all the time.
Word was they never checked IDs.

278
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:46,928
How'd they keep it open?

279
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,361
Good luck.

280
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,932
Connections.

281
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:54,932
Well, if someone did drug my dad, this
would have been the only place to do it.

282
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,478
I don't know what you kids heard,
but we don't serve minors in here.

283
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:13,488
I just want to ask a few questions.
My name's Clark Kent, Jonathan's son.

284
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,216
Jonathan.

285
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,059
Listen, I'm sorry about what happened.

286
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:23,260
Do you remember if he was
talking to anyone the other night?

287
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,268
He was talking to everybody,
blowing off steam.

288
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,896
Sounded like he had a major run-in
with Lionel Luthor.

289
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,505
Sheriff said he bought
a bottle of tequila from you.

290
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,211
Yeah, I wish I hadn't done it now.

291
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,714
The cops want me to testify.

292
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,117
I could lose my liquor license.

293
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:48,225
He never drinks more than one or two beers.
Did someone put something in his drink?

294
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:52,352
Nobody had to put anything in his drink
the way he was knocking them back.

295
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,435
Listen, I know you don't
wanna hear this...

296
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:01,060
...but Jonathan said he was gonna
take care of Lionel, once and for all.

297
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,799
- He'd never say that.
- I've known him since high school.

298
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,602
He's always had a temper.

299
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,041
There's no doubt in my mind he did it.

300
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,442
You're just as bad as your old man.

301
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,245
Clark, let him go, man.

302
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,322
Clark, let him go! Be cool.

303
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,333
The guy's lying. He's involved. I think
he's the one who spiked my dad's drink.

304
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:36,974
Clark, look, I'm on your side...

305
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,600
...but putting a bartender through
spin cycle isn't the thing to do now.

306
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,713
I know. I'm sorry.

307
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,078
Pete, look out!

308
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:36,692
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

309
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,671
But you must have definitely
ticked someone off.

310
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:06,059
Clark, I heard you had a narrow escape.

311
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,459
What do you care?

312
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,100
I think this may be connected
to my father's shooting.

313
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,498
- I warned you to stay out of this, Clark.
- Why?

314
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:15,401
- To control the situation?
- I'm not controlling anything.

315
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,508
I don't know who to believe anymore.

316
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,746
- Dominic made quite an impression.
- This isn't about Dominic.

317
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:27,181
He's asked the hospital staff
to keep me away from my father.

318
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,820
- Why do you think that is?
- Probably to protect him.

319
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,386
Or himself.

320
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:36,918
If my father regains consciousness,
he may be able to identify who shot him.

321
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,794
You think Dominic's involved?

322
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,989
Why would he turn against Lionel?

323
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:45,762
Because the decision to buy out LexCorp
affects him as much as it does me.

324
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,635
- Something stronger than words
to back up those threats, son...

325
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:54,177
...because as of this moment,
you are just another employee.

326
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,904
I'm going to Metropolis.

327
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:00,518
When I get back, I want you gone.

328
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,868
You never told me you wanted Lex back.

329
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,599
I thought it was assumed.

330
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:30,011
You know I care about this company. I can't
believe you're giving Lex another chance.

331
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,149
I gave Lex a taste of independence...

332
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,911
...to demonstrate the futility
of working against me.

333
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:39,318
But I always intended to bring him
back into the fold.

334
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,018
You made promises to me,
promises that I expect you to keep.

335
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,262
You've been loyal, Dominic...

336
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:49,264
...but Lex is blood.

337
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:53,234
I've worked too long to let you
take everything away from me now.

338
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,544
I forgot my keys.

339
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,039
He was angry enough to shoot your father?

340
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:11,152
Seizing the reins of a billion-dollar
corporation is a powerful incentive.

341
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,415
All he needed was
someone to take the blame.

342
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,638
Why didn't you tell anyone about this?

343
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:33,107
My father was shot the same day
he bought my company out from under me.

344
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:36,872
While you were playing it close to the vest,
my father was in jail.

345
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:41,712
- How long would you let him stay there?
- Until I knew for sure he didn't do it.

346
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,114
Now I do.

347
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,654
Look, the shooting is related
to the buyout.

348
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,258
I needed the guilty party to make a mistake.

349
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,892
Like trying to kill me and Pete?

350
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:00,565
So, what now?

351
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,737
Lana...

352
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,435
...I got your message.
What's the urgency?

353
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:13,011
I know about the complaint
Lionel Luthor filed against you.

354
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,118
Have you been snooping into my past?

355
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:21,485
I was curious to find out why you wouldn't
help one of my closest friends.

356
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,524
And that gives you the right to pry?

357
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:27,456
I'm your daughter. If we're gonna have
more than the same DNA in common...

358
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:31,659
...we have to be honest with each other.
- I didn't ask you to barge into my life.

359
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:38,437
Don't worry. You know,
I won't be imposing on you again.

360
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:50,685
- Lionel Luthor has nothing to do with this.
- I saw the complaint.

361
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:56,384
Payback after I refused to go along
with one of his ethically dubious schemes.

362
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:59,223
Business as usual for LuthorCorp.

363
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,566
You should have kept on digging.

364
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,697
And what would I have found?

365
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,496
Kansas v. Sutton,
a murder trial back in the early '90s.

366
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,140
I don't understand.

367
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:19,541
I was defense counsel, court-appointed,
which meant I didn't give a damn.

368
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:24,416
Five years after conviction, his family has
evidence retested, proving he was innocent.

369
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:28,157
So you were still able
to get him out, right?

370
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,917
By then it was too late.

371
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:33,696
He had been executed
three months before.

372
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,767
After that, I hung it all up.

373
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:41,235
Now I try to save the world
from my living room.

374
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,708
But at least I know
nobody's gonna die because of me.

375
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,310
I know you can't undo the past...

376
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:52,178
...but you can't hide from it, either.

377
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,758
Lana? What are you doing here?

378
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,417
Just offering some moral support.

379
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,894
Brought some reinforcements.

380
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:10,000
- I'd like to handle your father's case.
- Of course.

381
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:13,433
We need all the help we can get.
Thank you.

382
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,935
How'd you get him to change his mind?

383
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:21,272
We set the ground rules for our relationship,
and we promised to be honest...

384
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,107
...no matter what.

385
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,776
I've got a bail hearing set this afternoon.

386
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:31,945
I'm sure with Jonathan's standing in the
community, we can have him out by supper.

387
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,614
I just got good news from Lex.
His dad's doing better.

388
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,451
- He's expected to regain consciousness.
- Oh, thank God.

389
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,061
Dad, and if he does,
maybe he can ID the shooter.

390
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,096
That's a big "if," given his blindness.

391
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,099
Look, we're not out of the woods yet.

392
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:49,334
Lex Luthor's alibi checks out,
but Dominic Santori's is flimsy.

393
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,236
That should be good news for me.

394
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,776
The bartender who could corroborate
his involvement has disappeared.

395
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:58,609
Now, without him, it's gonna be hard
to keep your case from going to trial.

396
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,192
Breaking and entering really necessary?

397
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:12,152
- Thought the police checked this place out.
- Yeah.

398
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,561
They checked out the area
where my dad was arrested too.

399
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,963
I'm gonna look over here.

400
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,179
Pete!

401
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,130
Oh, man, talk about sleeping
with the fishes.

402
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,437
I think I know who shot Lionel Luthor.

403
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,386
Lex had his father moved to another floor.

404
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,295
We put the word out
that Lionel was getting better...

405
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:56,365
...guessing it would draw you out.

406
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,065
Kept hoping I was wrong.

407
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:12,612
- What the hell?
- You went to high school with my dad.

408
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,547
So did Mike the bartender.

409
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,882
You and Mike were more than friends.
You had a business arrangement.

410
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,614
Clark, I can explain.

411
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,954
Explain how a bar with
repeated violations stays open?

412
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:26,563
Or how all the evidence conveniently
pointed toward my dad?

413
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,632
You found out about my dad's fight,
and it all came together.

414
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,867
Is that you?

415
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:11,270
Didn't I make it clear?
The conversation is over.

416
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:29,221
You faked my dad's blood-alcohol test...

417
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:32,453
...and when I started to check out
your story, you came after me.

418
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,791
My dad trusted you.
How could you do that?

419
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,393
Don't you see, Clark? It's not just about me.

420
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,897
It's the Luthors. They're like a cancer...

421
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,769
...destroying everything they touch.

422
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,773
The Luthors didn't kill anyone.

423
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,572
The Luthors didn't frame my dad.

424
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,884
What have I done?

425
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,473
Just wanted to make sure
your dad was doing all right.

426
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:18,770
He says he is.

427
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,502
You don't sound too convinced.

428
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,243
I found this in the house.

429
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,281
It's my dad's high-school yearbook.

430
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,348
Him and Ethan were in the same class.

431
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,184
"To Jonathan...

432
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,225
...a great quarterback,
a better friend, Ethan."

433
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,322
You grow up with someone,
you think you know them, but...

434
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,663
...I mean, darkness like that
just doesn't come out of nowhere.

435
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,970
I'm sorry about your company.

436
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,406
What's gonna happen next?

437
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,051
My father thinks
I'll go back to work for him.

438
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,484
Will you?

439
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,123
It's hard to imagine working for a man...

440
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:11,785
...who can enrage four people to the point
where any of them had motive to kill him.

441
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:15,627
Even you.

442
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,840
You know that darkness
you were talking about?

443
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:28,342
I'm not sure we're born with it. People
like my father find a way to bring it out.

444
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,181
So are we okay?

445
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,420
I wish I could help you with your father.

446
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,988
I can take him.

447
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,845
Dad.

448
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,744
Son.

449
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,749
I understand you've had a busy few days.

450
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:12,520
In case you hadn't heard...

451
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:16,956
...Ethan has been charged in the murder
of the bartender and the attempt on you.

452
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:26,199
It truly is a sad day in Smallville.

453
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:32,003
I'm sure some version of the truth
will come out sooner or later...

454
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:34,269
...but I was hoping to hear it
from you first.

455
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,914
The sheriff and I simply...

456
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:45,984
...had a misunderstanding.

457
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,893
Sheriff.

458
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,901
You have something for me?

459
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:07,542
These are good people who happened
to make mistakes.

460
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:11,011
Yes, well, we're, all of us,
only human, sheriff.

461
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:14,274
These particular people sit on the board
of my son's company...

462
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:17,819
...so they need a little incentive
to sell their voting shares to me.

463
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,391
- Goodbye, Mr. Luthor.
- I hope this will be...

464
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,688
...the beginning of a long
and profitable relationship.

465
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:31,499
Our arrangement was for this one time only.

466
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:39,265
Now, did that proviso come before
or after you insisted on cash in advance?

467
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,312
I was strapped.

468
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,947
But don't think you own me.

469
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,345
I've documented your backroom deals.

470
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,384
You push me, and I just have
to make one call.

471
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,453
Would that be to your attorney?

472
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:52,917
He...

473
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:56,789
...passed along your documented evidence.

474
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,857
Along with his best wishes.

475
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:03,365
You know...

476
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:06,662
...my reputation in Smallville is...

477
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,664
...of no importance to me...

478
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,273
...but yours...

479
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:15,070
...it's your lifeblood, sheriff.

480
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:21,011
Sheriff? That's an elected position,
isn't it?

481
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:25,213
Don't threaten me, you son of a bitch.

482
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,850
Good evening, sheriff.

483
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:48,344
So you took an honest man
and destroyed him...

484
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:52,107
...and by proxy
almost ruined Jonathan Kent.

485
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,116
How does it feel, Dad,
knowing you brought this on yourself?

486
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,454
But I didn't, Lex.

487
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,714
You did...

488
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:04,918
...engineering your
ill-advised employee coup.

489
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,794
And you actually believe that?

490
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,003
It's all right, son.

491
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,572
I forgive you.

492
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:22,111
Now it's time to look to the future.

493
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,813
Together.

494
