1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,600
- Okay, here we go, nice and wet.
- Oh, yeah.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,680
Calm down, now, calm down.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,680
Sorry, guys, but the coffee here
is strictly non-Irish.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,360
- Come on, loosen up.
- Yeah, have a drink.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,520
If that's what I think it is,
you'll have to take it outside.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,640
Besides, we're closing.

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,720
- Can I get you anything else?
- Just a boyfriend who can keep a date.

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,360
You're definitely talking
to the wrong person.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,080
Dr. Bryce, are you sure you're okay?

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,840
Yeah, I just thought
I saw someone I knew.

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,400
But it's late. I better be going.
Thanks, Lana.

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,040
No problem. Bye.

13
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,120
- Go get her, Andy.
- Hey.

14
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,280
We heard this place had
the friendliest service in town.

15
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,320
Just leave.

16
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,040
That's no way to talk to a customer.

17
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,840
Hey!

18
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,920
Why don't we take this into the back
and have a private party.

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,600
Stop. Get away from her.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,800
Isn't it past your bedtime?

21
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,320
Look, the police are on their way.
Right now.

22
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,120
Come on, let's go.

23
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,040
Lana, are you okay?

24
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,600
Yeah.

25
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,200
Did you see the stupid look on her face?

26
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,840
Check out Speedy Gonzales.

27
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,920
I don't want to see any of you
in the Talon again. Got it?

28
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,840
Listen, John Boy.
We'll do whatever the hell we want.

29
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,720
Matter of fact, we were thinking
about stopping by tomorrow.

30
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,240
- I won't tell you again.
- Oh, I get it.

31
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,000
You got the hots for that bitch manager.

32
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,080
It's too bad she's a real dirty slut.

33
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,200
All right, you want to try it on, farm boy?
Let's see what you're made of.

34
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,120
Get your coffee somewhere else.

35
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,920
On your knees.

36
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,080
Hands behind your head. Now.

37
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,440
Now!

38
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,960
So you're the new sheriff in town.

39
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,800
You writing a book, Mr. Kent?

40
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,160
No, ma'am.

41
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,000
Then keep the chitter-chatter to yourself.

42
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,640
Flying boys.

43
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,360
Flying boys aren't something
you see every day.

44
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,400
That young man told me
you attacked him and his friends...

45
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,200
...then threw him 30 feet onto my car.
- That's crazy.

46
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,160
How come the paramedics are all over
them and there's not a scratch on you?

47
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,280
What about you, Miss Lang?

48
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,520
What'd you see?

49
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,560
Nothing.

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,440
- You're lying, you know.
- Excuse me?

51
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,200
You said you made a good cappuccino.

52
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,760
This is a great cappuccino.

53
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,240
- Looks like we're done here.
- No, Mr. Kent.

54
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,560
We are just getting started.

55
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,760
Sheriff, we know our son, and Clark
would never deliberately hurt anybody.

56
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,720
I'm sure, whatever he did,
he did it because he thought he had to.

57
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,360
By throwing another young man
across my police car?

58
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,600
I ran a complete check
on your son, Mr. Kent.

59
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,880
He's been at more crime scenes
than Eliot Ness.

60
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,040
If Clark's been involved with police
business, he was trying to help people.

61
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,280
Or he's got some kind of hero complex.
Even heroes gotta play by the rules.

62
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,880
That's why I'm charging him
with misdemeanor battery.

63
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,600
What exactly does that mean?

64
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,160
Could be a $ 1500 fine,
depends on the judge.

65
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,960
I'm sorry, but we can't afford that.

66
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,400
Clark. Sit down.

67
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,240
Well, I'll make you a deal, Mr. Kent.

68
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,040
I won't charge you if you are willing
to do the community service.

69
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,480
And then you can keep the world safe
from roadside litter.

70
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,280
Wait just a minute. Who...?

71
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,240
Your former sheriff, he may have looked
way the other way on these matters...

72
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,600
...but I'm here to tell you,
those good-old-boy days are over.

73
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,320
Nighty-night.

74
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,120
Metropolis Flower Show, 1999.
You couldn't take your eyes off of them.

75
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,680
Paul?

76
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,840
Dr. Bryce.

77
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,520
I thought I saw you last night.

78
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,320
You did. And I was gonna say hi...

79
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,520
...but it was really late and you didn't
look like you wanted any company.

80
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,200
- What are you doing in Smallville?
- I'm here on business.

81
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,000
And I read that you were
getting married.

82
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,960
You shouldn't believe
everything you read.

83
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,440
Right now Lex and I are married
to our careers.

84
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,960
At least, that's what we tell each other.

85
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,680
Lex! I'd like you to meet
an old friend of mine...

86
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,680
...Paul Hayden.

87
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,160
Hey.

88
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,840
I take it you two knew each other
from Metropolis.

89
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,720
Well, we actually dated
for a while in med school.

90
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,200
Until we realized we weren't
gonna live happily ever after...

91
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,840
...at least not with each other.

92
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,520
Well, Paul, it was nice seeing you.

93
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,240
- Lex and I are on our way to lunch, so...
- Actually...

94
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,200
...I stopped by to tell you
I can't make it. I'm sorry.

95
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,480
Well, maybe I could fill in,
you know, if it's okay with Lex.

96
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm sure you two have
a lot of catching up to do.

97
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,240
Patient emergency. I'll have to take
a rain check on that lunch.

98
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,280
Give Lex the number where you're
staying, and we'll plan to get together.

99
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,720
Yeah, sounds great.

100
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,520
Same old Helen.

101
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,040
One minute she's here,
the next she's gone.

102
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,760
Hang on to her, Lex...

103
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,320
...if you can.

104
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,480
- Clark Kent, convict.
- Yeah, I know.

105
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,880
When do you get fitted for
that orange jumpsuit?

106
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,720
Or is it one-size-fits-all?

107
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,760
Forty hours of community service
is not funny.

108
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,640
- It's an orange vest.
- Oh, no, it's gonna clash with the plaid.

109
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,920
Welcome to Smallville, where you stop
the crime, you do the time.

110
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,920
Very pithy.

111
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,400
Maybe I should use that
as my campaign slogan, huh?

112
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,840
We're gonna see you bright and early
tomorrow, Mr. Kent.

113
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,440
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Yeah.

114
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,760
All right.

115
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,080
Good luck on the chain gang.

116
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,160
- Hey.
- Hey.

117
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,440
Hey, Lana, what's wrong?

118
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,280
According to the sheriff, I don't have
a case that'll hold up in court.

119
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,960
It's all hearsay.

120
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,960
At least you were there, Clark.

121
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah, look where it got me.

122
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,960
I'm sorry.

123
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,560
So how'd you do it, Clark?

124
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,800
I know you can take care of yourself,
but there were three of them.

125
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,160
They were drunk.

126
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,760
And I was highly motivated by
the thought of someone hurting you.

127
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,840
You can't keep your eye
on me every second.

128
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,040
I can try.

129
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,600
You're always there to save me.

130
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,440
I just wish for once
I could have saved myself.

131
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,000
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

132
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,320
No, it's okay.
Guess I'm still a little jumpy.

133
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,920
It's understandable.
You had quite an ordeal.

134
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,840
I just feel so stupid.
It's not like I was even hurt.

135
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,440
No, this place has always been
a safe haven for you.

136
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,080
Now that's been violated.

137
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,960
So now what, I become a shut-in?

138
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,280
Lana, I know what it's like
to feel vulnerable.

139
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,600
You?

140
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,040
Trust me, eccentric bald kids sit
pretty low on the prep-school totem pole.

141
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,200
I was bullied for years...

142
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,880
...till one day I decided I'd had enough.

143
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,760
What'd you do?

144
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,280
One of my father's chauffeurs
was an ex-Navy SEAL.

145
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,920
I convinced him to teach me to fight.

146
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,120
The next time I was cornered,
the guy ended up needing dental work.

147
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,120
- I could never hurt anybody.
- It's not about hurting people.

148
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,880
It's about reclaiming
your sense of control over your life.

149
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,960
Isn't that what you want?

150
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,400
One million dollars.

151
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,800
The sheriff said
he had a few cuts and bruises.

152
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,000
Now he claims
to have "severe neck injury."

153
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,000
Punitive damages, pain and suffering,
loss of future earnings.

154
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,680
They're saying Andy's mobility
may be permanently limited.

155
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,560
They hired the best
personal-injury attorney in the state.

156
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,120
You did throw him into that car, Clark.

157
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,680
Maybe this is where it starts.
Remember what it said in the spaceship?

158
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,520
"They're a flawed race,
rule them with strength."

159
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,320
Son...

160
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,640
...I got into a lot of fights
when I was your age, believe me.

161
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,360
But, Clark, these are not alien feelings.

162
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,960
What you have to remember
under these circumstances...

163
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,720
...is that there are consequences.

164
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Your father's right.

165
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,520
You'll make decisions in a split second
you have to live with the rest of your life.

166
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,480
Clark, it's true.
We are a flawed race, sure...

167
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,240
...but we're a flawed race
that raised you.

168
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,680
You're a lot more human than you think.

169
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,120
Lex, it still won't start.

170
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,520
How far away are you?

171
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,720
Okay. I'll see you in a sec.

172
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,400
You always had
the worst luck with cars.

173
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,400
Paul.

174
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,320
- What are you doing here?
- It must be kismet.

175
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,360
I dropped my cell phone,
came back to get it, and here you were.

176
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,920
- How about I give you a ride?
- Lex is on his way.

177
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,520
Come on, Helen, why wait?

178
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,560
Same old Helen.

179
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,120
Never wanted my help.
Must be different with Lex, huh?

180
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,640
Yes. It is.

181
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,640
Here comes Prince Charming now.

182
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,600
Helen. Is everything all right?

183
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,800
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah?

184
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,440
Hey.

185
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,880
Hello, Paul.

186
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,720
- I didn't expect to see you here.
- Happened to be in the neighborhood.

187
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,920
Twice in one day.
Three times if you count last night.

188
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,040
Careful, I might think you're
stalking my girlfriend.

189
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,760
- Come on, let's go.
- Why would I wanna do that?

190
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,840
You're not over her.

191
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,440
I was just trying to be a Good Samaritan.

192
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,640
So when my mechanic looks
over this car, he's not gonna...

193
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,440
...find missing spark plugs
or sugar in the gas tank?

194
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,480
Lex, enough.

195
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,840
You really are paranoid.

196
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,320
No.

197
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,160
I'm just a frighteningly
good judge of character.

198
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,560
I strongly suggest
you stay away from Helen.

199
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,680
Is that a threat?

200
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,800
You seem like a simple guy, Paul.

201
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,200
I'd hate for your life to get complicated.

202
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,400
He's back at the motel, Mr. Luthor.

203
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,040
You know I love you, Helen.

204
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,680
And you know that
I would do anything to be with you.

205
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,520
I do mean anything.

206
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,800
- Paul.
- Helen.

207
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,600
What happened to you?

208
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,120
Lex.

209
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,720
Lex did this to me.

210
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,200
Lex, we need to talk.

211
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,200
- What's going on?
- Paul claims you had him beaten up.

212
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,520
From the tone in your voice
it sounds like you believe him.

213
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,480
For two weeks you've been ignoring me.
Suddenly Paul shows up, you're jealous.

214
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,720
I'm not jealous, I'm concerned.

215
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,320
Especially about someone who's
unhinged enough to do that to himself.

216
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,800
Helen, he's clearly stalking you.

217
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,160
I don't understand it.
I mean, we were never that serious.

218
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,920
It was a relationship of convenience.
There was no emotional involvement.

219
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,000
Could have fooled him.

220
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,840
- Who broke it off?
- I did.

221
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,160
One of his ex-girlfriends
warned me to stay away from him.

222
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,720
She claimed that he beat her up.

223
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,240
She ever report him to the police?

224
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,800
No, but I wasn't gonna wait around
to see if history repeated itself...

225
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,240
...so I broke it off
and we never spoke after that.

226
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,160
Three months later
he dropped out of school.

227
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,160
Mr. Luthor...

228
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,520
...just the man I was looking for.

229
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,720
I didn't have Paul Hayden beaten up.

230
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,840
I usually like to ask the questions
before I get the answers.

231
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,520
A natural flow of things.

232
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,160
- Where were you earlier this evening?
- At home, a fact my staff can confirm.

233
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,440
You didn't threaten Paul Hayden
in the medical center parking lot?

234
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,880
He's stalking my girlfriend.

235
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,680
According to him, he offered her a ride.
That's not exactly criminal behavior.

236
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,000
Sheriff, if you want to play
letter of the law, you go right ahead.

237
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,720
I just hope your professional instincts
lead you back in the right direction.

238
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,400
Don't worry, they always do, Mr. Luthor.

239
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,880
I'll stay in touch.

240
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,000
- Morning, Clark.
- Look, don't even start.

241
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,520
I've had half of Smallville High out here
already giving me a hard time.

242
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,640
Would it be violating your parole
to take a coffee break?

243
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,000
That'd be the least of my problems.

244
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,120
That kid who harassed Lana is suing us.
He could literally take the farm.

245
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,640
It's hard to believe someone could
come into your life and screw it up.

246
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,080
Lana's a wreck, I'm picking up trash,
and this guy's walking around free.

247
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,280
I wouldn't worry too much about Lana.

248
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,680
Why's that?

249
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,480
Let's just say the crouching tigress is
about to find her hidden dragon.

250
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,000
I can't even get the bag to move.

251
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,520
I don't see how I can take on
a guy twice my size.

252
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,800
Lana, getting the upper hand
isn't about size...

253
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,800
...it's about decisiveness and speed.
You have to commit.

254
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,600
You're only putting part of yourself
into it. If you want to be effective...

255
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,640
...you have to put
your whole body into it.

256
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,040
- Okay?
- Okay.

257
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,760
There you go, that's it.

258
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,400
Now channel all your anger.

259
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,360
Some of us aren't as angry
as you are, Lex.

260
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,160
Of course not.
And what's to be angry about?

261
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,040
It's not like a bunch of frat boys came
into your own place and harassed you.

262
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,360
It's not like you felt helpless
when that guy shoved you.

263
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,160
And I know it doesn't make you mad that
you needed Clark Kent to save you again.

264
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,720
Better.

265
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,080
Andy.

266
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,000
Restraining order says you can't come
within 500 feet of me, Kent.

267
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,440
I just want to talk.

268
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,520
Anything you gotta say,
say to my lawyer.

269
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,080
- Let me apologize.
- Yeah, it's too late. What?

270
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,040
We both made mistakes
the other night...

271
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,760
...and I understand you're mad at me,
but this lawsuit could ruin my family.

272
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,280
Just leave them out of it.

273
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,280
I'll see you in court.

274
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,640
If you break this restraining order again,
I'll have the sheriff all over your ass.

275
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,640
Yo, Joe Millionaire, what's up?

276
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,920
Easy, man, don't hurt yourself.

277
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,520
- What's up?
- Andy Connors is faking his injuries.

278
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,480
Well, that's an intriguing claim,
but as the defendant...

279
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,600
...I doubt your case holds much water.
- I followed him home.

280
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,360
I saw him take his neck brace off.

281
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,160
I was trying to gather some evidence
so I could nail him.

282
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,920
I'm always up for a good conspiracy.

283
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,000
- Thanks, Chloe.
- Or if all else fails...

284
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,120
...we could send Lana out
to beat the confession out of him.

285
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,320
It was a joke, Clark.

286
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,600
Why do I get the feeling
you're not impressed...

287
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,960
...with Lana turning
all Charlie's Angels on us?

288
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,280
I know Lex's intentions are good...

289
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,280
...but what if she gets overconfident...

290
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,800
...finds herself in a situation
she can't handle?

291
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,040
Clark, as a 6-foot-whatever guy...

292
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,080
...you don't know how it feels
to cross the street at night...

293
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,840
...when you hear footsteps.

294
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,520
If getting a little girl-power makes
Lana feel like less of a victim...

295
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,800
...then you should be all for it.

296
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,840
I guess.

297
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,200
Or are you secretly worried
that if Lana learns to defend herself...

298
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,840
...she won't need a knight in
shining armor to rescue her anymore?

299
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,560
Doctor?

300
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,040
Paul.

301
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,480
What are you doing here?

302
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,400
I had to see you alone.

303
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,600
All right, why don't we go upstairs
and we can talk about it over coffee.

304
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,720
No, we can't go and have coffee,
thank you very much.

305
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,840
When you broke up with me,
I thought that it was because...

306
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,760
...you knew I was never gonna be
a great doctor.

307
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,960
You were right, that's why I quit.

308
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,800
If you can't be great, why bother at all?
That's what you used to say, right?

309
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,720
- Paul.
- I was working on becoming successful...

310
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,240
...so that I could have you back.

311
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,080
Then I found out
that you were with Luthor...

312
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,520
...and I knew
I had to save you from that fraud.

313
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,920
I don't want you to save me.

314
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,440
Look, I broke up with you
because you beat your ex-girlfriend.

315
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,400
No, no, no! She was so beneath me.

316
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,640
That's not the case with you and I.
You and I were meant for each other.

317
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,800
I love Lex.

318
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,440
No, you don't.

319
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,480
You love me, you just don't know it yet.

320
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,120
Get away from me, Paul!

321
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,520
- Hello?
- Helen, it's me.

322
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,320
Look. You're right, I've been distant
the last few weeks...

323
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,960
...but that's gonna change.
I'm on my way over so we can talk.

324
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,080
- Helen?
- I'm busy with a patient.

325
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,120
In the pathology lab.

326
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,960
- Helen?
- That was him, wasn't it?

327
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,120
It was him, wasn't it?

328
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,720
He doesn't love you.
Can you see that?

329
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,720
Helen, what's going on?

330
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,080
Get up here. Get up here, come on!

331
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,880
Helen!

332
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,000
Paul, no! Help!

333
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,160
Helen!

334
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,160
Helen!

335
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,760
Helen!

336
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,720
Helen!

337
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:15,320
Get her to ER.
I need 2 cc's epi and an IV push. Stat!

338
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,480
Stat!

339
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,240
Helen. No.

340
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,560
Smallville is officially litter-free.

341
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,360
- You must be exhausted.
- Well, frustrated and humiliated, yes...

342
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,640
...exhausted, no.

343
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,320
I can stick around for a little while
if you want.

344
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,960
I'm fine, Clark.

345
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,880
I know, I just thought
you might want some company.

346
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,120
Karate class?
I take it the meeting with Lex went well.

347
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,920
Lex has a way of bringing out a side
of me that's both scary and liberating.

348
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,560
But you know the first rule
of self-defense is to avoid conflict.

349
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,400
Relax, Clark, I'm not about to go
prowling the night fighting crime.

350
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,880
I'll leave that to the expert.

351
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,160
Trust me, there's no future in fighting
crime unless you enjoy being sued.

352
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,200
You know the worst part? I know
he's faking, I just don't have proof.

353
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,880
I was gonna follow him with a camera,
but I'd be violating the restraining order.

354
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,920
Well, what about me?

355
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,160
What about you?

356
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,560
I wanna see him go down
as badly as you do. Let me help.

357
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,440
No, that'd be too dangerous.

358
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,040
Clark, the law's not on our side.
What are we supposed to do?

359
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,400
Meacham, where the hell are you?

360
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,840
- I need to know where Hayden is, now.
- Mr. Luthor...

361
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,920
...I am sorry about Dr. Bryce.

362
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,560
But I hope you are not planning
to take the law into your own hands.

363
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,000
The woman I love is fighting
for her life, sheriff, so...

364
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,360
...you'll have to excuse my lack of faith
in Smallville's finest.

365
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,000
I have roadblocks up
across every major highway...

366
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,320
...I have deputies canvassing the area...

367
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,840
...and I'm waiting for a warrant
on his motel room.

368
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,920
- How long will it take?
- A little while...

369
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,400
...but I have rung every judge's bell
in Lowell County.

370
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,440
I'm certainly glad you're doing
everything humanly possible.

371
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,840
Mr. Luthor, where are you going?

372
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,240
If I find you tampered
with the investigation...

373
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,600
You'll what?

374
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,840
You'll arrest me
and make me pick up trash?

375
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,640
You are not above the law, Mr. Luthor.

376
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,400
Thank you for that bracing insight.
Am I free to go now?

377
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,360
Meacham!

378
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,080
Lex?

379
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,680
Sheriff, I heard about Dr. Bryce.
Is she okay?

380
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,720
- Still touch-and-go.
- Was it Paul Hayden?

381
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,720
Mr. Kent, do I have to remind you about
involving yourself in police business?

382
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,520
Where are we on the warrant
for Hayden's room at the Heartland?

383
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,160
Twenty minutes.
We have a car standing by.

384
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,040
- Clark, how did you...?
- Same way you did.

385
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,640
What are you doing here, Lex?

386
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,880
- Look, stay out of this.
- They know you want to nail this guy.

387
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,400
What, I should leave it to the pros?

388
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:05,880
Hayden's car is still here, okay?
I had a guy on him, now he's no...

389
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,480
Son of a bitch. He's got Meacham's car.

390
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,800
Lex, we've got company.

391
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,120
LoJack system said the car was here.

392
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,000
I thought only the police
had access to LoJack.

393
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,440
- Let's split up.
- We should wait for Sheriff Adams.

394
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,960
You wait, I'm gonna go look around.

395
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,200
If you pull that trigger,
you'll be the one going to prison.

396
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,160
Not if it's self-defense.

397
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,840
I guess I forgot to load it.

398
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,240
You're just full of surprises today,
aren't you?

399
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,160
Goodbye, Paul.

400
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,200
Lex!

401
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,160
Hands up.

402
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,560
Get rid of that gun.
Put that gun on the table right now.

403
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,680
Put it on the table now!

404
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:02,640
Last time I checked,
citizen's arrests are still legal in Kansas.

405
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,920
Oh, man.

406
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,160
I'm telling you...

407
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:17,600
...if I catch you meddling
in a police investigation again I swear...

408
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,840
...heaven help you.

409
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,000
Thanks for coming.

410
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,760
Well. This better be good,
to get me out of bed so early.

411
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,320
Listen, Andy...

412
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,880
...I'm really sorry about
what happened the other night.

413
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,000
But I think this has gotten
a little out of hand. The lawsuit...

414
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,120
Don't worry about it.
It's Kent's problem.

415
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,000
I know you're faking your injuries.

416
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,920
I think you should drop the suit
before you get caught.

417
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,720
You didn't call me here
to talk about the lawsuit, did you?

418
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,520
Touch me again and you'll
have some real soft-tissue injury.

419
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,400
You can play hard to get,
but we both know you want me.

420
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,840
So why don't we take this
into the back?

421
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,520
Hi, Clark.

422
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,760
I just got a phone call saying
that Andy dropped the lawsuit.

423
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,680
Any idea what could have
made him do that?

424
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,800
Maybe he just realized
that you were trying to help a friend.

425
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,880
Sheriff told me you have
quite a spin kick.

426
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,960
I'm sorry I missed it.

427
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,080
So you heard about that.

428
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,680
- Lana...
- Clark, I know what you're gonna say...

429
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:31,240
...I shouldn't have gotten involved, but...
- I just wanted to say thank you.

430
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:41,240
You've been there for me so many times,
I just wanted to repay you.

431
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:51,320
Besides, it's not every day that Lana Lang
gets a chance to save Clark Kent.

432
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,560
Yeah.

433
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,480
I thought you had a board meeting.

434
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,880
I cancelled it for personal reasons.

435
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,600
That's a first.

436
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,680
My lawyer told me that...

437
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,160
...Paul is pleading temporary insanity.
- Lex, l...

438
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,720
I told him not to fight the plea.

439
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,800
Paul needs help.

440
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,400
I wanted to kill him, Helen.

441
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,720
I wanted to kill him
for what he did to you.

442
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,440
I probably could have gotten away
with it in everyone's eyes...

443
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,320
...but one person would
have known the truth.

444
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,280
Clark.

445
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,840
You.

446
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,120
Clark didn't save me
in that moment, Helen.

447
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,280
You did.

448
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,400
And that's when I knew.

449
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,320
So, what do you say, Dr. Bryce?

450
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,400
Will you marry me?
