1
00:00:02,697 --> 00:00:06,324
I don't even know where to start.
I know you must have...

2
00:00:06,402 --> 00:00:10,186
a million questions, but I don't know
how many answers I can give you.

3
00:00:10,615 --> 00:00:14,164
If you're watching this,
it means I'm probably dead.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:21,178
You were always the one good thing in my life, and if I didn't
tell you enough, I care about you more than you'll ever know.

5
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:24,572
Please find out who did this, clark.

6
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:28,902
You're the only one who can.

7
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:48,171
K-E-N-T.

8
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:52,563
Kent. It's a farm.
Do they even have addresses?

9
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,881
look, the last super genius I had on the line
told me to turn right on route 31.

10
00:01:01,947 --> 00:01:04,484
Now I'm totally lost.

11
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,848
Oh, about a billion stalks of corn.

12
00:01:12,137 --> 00:01:14,391
That's just great.

13
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,110
Okay, if you smoke this, you are going to spend
the rest of the night hating yourself.

14
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:19,046
Oh, my god.

15
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:33,924
Are you... are you okay?

16
00:02:37,145 --> 00:02:38,680
What's your name?

17
00:02:40,053 --> 00:02:41,643
I don't know.

18
00:02:42,144 --> 00:02:44,609
I need to get you to a hospital.

19
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:46,482
I am fine.

20
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,157
You've just been hitby lightning,

21
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,214
you're stark naked, and, uh, and you
don't even remember your own name.

22
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:57,647
You have a fairly loose definition of "fine. "

23
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:02,078
Look at his face.

24
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,497
I have a blanket in the trunk.

25
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:12,025
Don't move. I'll be right back.

26
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,741
Wait.

27
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:16,925
Who are you?

28
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:19,384
Lois.

29
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:21,662
Lois lane.

35
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:42,879
Allah ho akbar!
Allah ho akbar!

36
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:22,485
Try and keep up.

37
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:24,315
Why are we here?

38
00:05:24,688 --> 00:05:27,678
- To get you checked out.
- I am fine.

39
00:05:27,934 --> 00:05:31,041
Do you know how many people are struck
by lightning every year? Hardly any.

40
00:05:31,116 --> 00:05:33,141
You know how many survive? Even less.

41
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,169
And the number who get
picked up by lost drivers? Zero.

42
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:40,653
So far you're 3-for-3, so how about a little less
complaining and a little more forward motion?

43
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:44,438
Excuse me. Got a guy here
who needs immediate attention.

44
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:49,158
- Fill out these admission forms and include proof of insurance.
- Slight problem...

45
00:05:49,238 --> 00:05:51,456
I don't know who he is, and...

46
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:52,773
neither does he.

47
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:56,192
He's got amnesia. So,
I'm turning him over to you.

48
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:58,158
You can keep the blanket.

49
00:05:59,532 --> 00:06:00,889
Whoa, whoa,

50
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,558
does this look like an animal shelter?

51
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,496
Now, you have to stay with him until
we find someone who can I.D. Him.

52
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,439
It's hospital policy.

53
00:06:09,774 --> 00:06:10,954
Look,

54
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:14,297
I did the good samaritan thing,
but I can't be responsible for this guy.

55
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:15,965
You already are.

56
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:18,640
Now I have to call a deputy to get your statement.

57
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,953
I think you might want to get him some clothes first.

58
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:53,415
Merci.

59
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:05,100
Ooh, sorry.

60
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:07,465
- You're american, right?
- Yes.

61
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:09,608
Great. Can I ask you a big favor?

62
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:11,968
Sure... as long as it doesn't get me arrested.

63
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:16,195
No, I'm supposed to meet my girlfriend here.
Well, she's not really my girlfriend...

64
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:18,142
even though we spend
every waking moment together.

65
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:23,610
See, we met two months ago today on this exact street corner, and
I bought her something to mark the occasion. I wanted to get your opinion.

66
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,839
All right.

67
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:35,967
Well, uh, I think that would probably be
the last thing she would be expecting.

68
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:38,228
It doesn't really scream "romance," does it?

69
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:43,519
But, see, the first time we met, I was driving by on my vespa,
and I clipped her. She thought I was going to steal her purse.

70
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:45,167
So she kicked me off my bike,

71
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:49,160
I messed up an old football injury, and then she spent
five hours with me at the hospital, and we just clicked.

72
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,480
Well, it sounds like love at first crash.

73
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:55,744
Yeah. Well, for me it was, anyway,
but I'm just an impulsive kind of guy.

74
00:07:55,804 --> 00:07:57,396
Well,how does she feel?

75
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,939
I don't know. She doesn't really
talk about it. I think she.. uh..

76
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,070
she got hurtby somebody, but...
maybe she needs to talk about it.

77
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:10,210
Well, nothing says "I love you"
like a motorcycle helmet.

78
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:13,021
Yeah,

79
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:16,086
it's for a weekend trip to nice... if she's...

80
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:17,895
if she's interested.

81
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:23,284
If a guy did something that romantic for me,

82
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:25,716
- I think I'd have to kiss him.
- Yeah?

83
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,974
Yeah.

84
00:08:34,427 --> 00:08:37,160
I'd love to go to nice with you, jason.

85
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:39,914
Happy anniversary, lana.

86
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:47,878
After breakfast, I wanted
to talk about the dead man

87
00:08:47,957 --> 00:08:50,946
and guess how he come to be killed.
But jim didn't want to.

88
00:08:51,222 --> 00:08:56,362
He said it would fetch bad luck, and besides,
he said, he might come back to haunt us

89
00:08:56,854 --> 00:08:58,958
Huck finn.

90
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,003
Jonathan's favorite.

91
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:06,054
Martha, I wanted to know
if you thought about what we discussed.

92
00:09:06,084 --> 00:09:08,838
I'm not pulling the plugon my husband.

93
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:14,341
It's been three months,
and there's been no change.

94
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:18,392
Jonathan is brain-dead.

95
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:20,919
Your insurance is already capped out.

96
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:22,811
You need to think about the future.

97
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:25,648
My future is lying in that bed.

98
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:27,909
I will not give upon him.

99
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,441
Okay,

100
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:52,100
we need to stay in the room.
I'm not supposed to be here.

101
00:09:52,188 --> 00:09:53,741
Yeah, well,

102
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:56,259
that makes two of us.

103
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,567
Stay. Good.

104
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:02,853
I came to smallville to investigate
my cousin's death.

105
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:05,526
Her name was chloe sullivan.
Heard of her?

106
00:10:06,943 --> 00:10:08,787
Of course you haven't.

107
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:12,879
Nicorette.

108
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,202
I've given up smoking. These are the only
things that get me through the day.

109
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:18,872
It started when I was 15.
It's my father's fault. He said if he

110
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:23,415
ever caught me smoking, he'd kill me, so in a fitof
teenage rebellion... I started,then I couldn't stop.

111
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:25,421
Now I've got a gum addiction.

112
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:27,125
You talk a lot.

113
00:10:27,164 --> 00:10:33,556
Well, I'm just notvery comfortable with uncomfortable silence,
and you're not exactly keeping up with your end of the conversation.

114
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:42,550
45 minutes, and still no doctor?

115
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:46,326
You know, if this isn't an indictment
of small town medicine, I don't know what is.

116
00:10:46,975 --> 00:10:47,807
Whoa!

117
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:49,208
Where are you going?

118
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,507
I'm leaving.

119
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,028
Well, you're gonna have to get through me first.

120
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:09,556
Hey!

121
00:11:13,262 --> 00:11:14,776
Wait! Wait!

122
00:11:15,268 --> 00:11:16,763
Wait, clark!

123
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:18,356
Okay, stop!

124
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:20,107
What was that?

125
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,493
It is you! I can't believe it!

126
00:11:24,532 --> 00:11:26,832
I thought I'd lost you forever.

127
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:28,347
Who are you?

128
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,809
It's me mom.

129
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:37,973
Don't take it personally. He doesn't
even remember his own name.

130
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:39,192
Lois lane.

131
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:41,827
I found him lying in a field near route 31.

132
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:43,495
Thank you for helping him.

133
00:11:43,555 --> 00:11:46,702
Guess I'm a sucker for stray dogs and naked guys.

134
00:11:48,197 --> 00:11:50,360
Okay, that didn't come out right.

135
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,070
It's been a long night, and I am nicotine deprived.

136
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,548
Come on, sweetheart. Let's get you home.

137
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:57,652
I'm waiting for the sign.

138
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:02,717
I think you should have a doctor take a look at him.
I'm starting to think the lightning fried his brain.

139
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:04,373
Um... lois?

140
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:06,242
I'm so grateful, but...

141
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:08,395
this is a family matter.

142
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:09,432
Okay.

143
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:11,970
Here's me backing away.

144
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:18,696
I don't know what's going on, but you need
to come home with me right now.

145
00:12:22,172 --> 00:12:24,945
I can help you find the sign,

146
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,130
but I need to get you out of here, okay?

147
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:29,503
Come on.

148
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:38,546
I passed amnesia boy off to his mother.
I didn't catch her name.

149
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,618
Yeah, martha kent. She's in here all the time.

150
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:43,990
Kent?

151
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:46,705
As in clark kent?

152
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:48,966
Wait a minute! I have to talk to...

153
00:12:49,753 --> 00:12:51,130
you.

154
00:13:06,734 --> 00:13:09,663
Heat too much for you, mr. Luthor?

155
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:12,377
I don't want any record that I was here.

156
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:21,051
Bury everything.

157
00:13:30,865 --> 00:13:34,148
We will be like footprints in the sand.

158
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:01,309
You're two hours late.

159
00:14:01,349 --> 00:14:03,630
I'm well aware of my tardiness, doctor.

160
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:05,479
But some things are worse the risk.

161
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,564
What's more important than your life?

162
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:09,074
The truth.

163
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:14,345
Your body survive da massive chemical on slaught
that would've killed 99.9% of people.

164
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:16,902
That in itself is a miracle.

165
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,896
Spare me the lecture.

166
00:14:19,397 --> 00:14:26,752
I told you, if your blood isn't purified every 72 hours,
your internal organs will start to shut down.

167
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:30,603
You're living on borrowed time, lex.

168
00:14:32,491 --> 00:14:34,418
Stop trying to borrow more.

169
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:51,900
What is this place?

170
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:54,901
Well, your dad calls it your fortress of solitude.

171
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:58,284
It's where you come to think and look at the stars.

172
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:08,406
Well, here's some pictures.

173
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:10,726
Maybe they'll jog your memory.

174
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:16,646
Who are these people?

175
00:15:17,158 --> 00:15:18,888
People who love you.

176
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:25,851
Do you remember anything about where you were
before you showed up in that field?

177
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,528
I was in a place that felt like home.

178
00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:31,338
No, clark,

179
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,811
this is your home.

180
00:15:40,381 --> 00:15:42,583
- I recognize this man.
- Good.

181
00:15:43,301 --> 00:15:45,700
That's your dad.
You're starting to remember.

182
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,474
He's not my father. He tried to
prevent me from being reborn.

183
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,023
No, clark.

184
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:54,547
He loves you, He tried
to save you from jor-el.

185
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,067
Either way, he's dead.

186
00:16:15,986 --> 00:16:17,736
Better buckle up, dr. Vaughn.

187
00:16:17,824 --> 00:16:19,338
We're about to hit some turbulence.

188
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:23,485
Oh, no!

189
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:26,750
Lex, no, wait! I'll get it for you!
I'll get it for you! Sit down!

190
00:16:58,905 --> 00:17:01,147
I am kal-el of krypton.

191
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:04,126
It is time to fulfill my destiny.

192
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,570
Destiny?

193
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:08,793
That's jor-el talking!

194
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,977
He did this to you!

195
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:14,374
I want my son back! Give me my son back!

196
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,597
Clark kent is dead.

197
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:07,636
Jason, stop it. We are in a church,
and I have an art history project to finish.

198
00:18:07,676 --> 00:18:12,726
Okay, when my girlfriend invites me to some old crypt for some
brass rubbing, I thought that was code for something else.

199
00:18:12,786 --> 00:18:14,713
Mr. Teague, you have a dirty mind.

200
00:18:14,773 --> 00:18:16,759
But I have a pure heart.

201
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:20,463
Wait, wait,

202
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:22,880
Come on, I've already scoped out our victim.

203
00:18:24,718 --> 00:18:26,287
Meet your art project

204
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:29,403
countess margaret isabelle theroux.

205
00:18:29,797 --> 00:18:33,273
It says here she was a warrior princess who...

206
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:36,272
kicked a lot of ass and broke a lot of hearts.

207
00:18:36,488 --> 00:18:39,222
Is that a direct translation?

208
00:18:39,655 --> 00:18:44,583
No, I just... I figured you guys had a lot in common.
You know, you're both, uh, you're both strong and, uh,

209
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:48,202
both uncompromising. Both beautiful.

210
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:51,525
We should get to work.

211
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:53,374
- The church closes in an hour.
- Not me.

212
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:55,750
I have a hot date to plan for tomorrow.

213
00:18:57,835 --> 00:19:00,057
Somebody failed to mention it was their birthday.

214
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:01,547
Who told you?

215
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:03,671
Sources at the high estlevel of government.

216
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,877
All right, I slipped the admissions clerk 20 euros.

217
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,193
Look, jason, I don't expect

218
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,828
stop talking. Start rubbing.

219
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:12,950
By the way,

220
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,611
festivities begin at 10 A.M. Tomorrow
at the cafe de fleurie.

221
00:19:20,388 --> 00:19:21,567
All right.

222
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:24,494
Okay.

223
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:36,700
No, it can't wait a couple of days.
I need to speak with him now.

224
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:38,268
Look, just

225
00:20:38,328 --> 00:20:41,809
tell him it's regarding my son clark kent.

226
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:43,223
Hey.

227
00:20:43,888 --> 00:20:46,562
I tried calling earlier,
but I kept getting a busy signal.

228
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:48,990
I don't know how you survive without call waiting.

229
00:20:49,226 --> 00:20:50,602
Where's clark?

230
00:20:52,098 --> 00:20:53,435
Upstairs.

231
00:20:53,494 --> 00:20:54,241
Great.

232
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:55,912
Um... sleeping.

233
00:20:57,605 --> 00:21:01,314
Is that fresh coffee?
I have been waiting for a cup all day.

234
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:04,598
I can't believe this is the town
that starbucks forgot.

235
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:09,141
I heard the only decent
coffee shop in town shut down.

236
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:10,735
The falcon or something?

237
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:14,807
Uh, lois, I really appreciate
everything you did for clark, and

238
00:21:14,846 --> 00:21:16,674
I don't mean to be rude, but

239
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:18,209
look,

240
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,431
I didn't come here fishing for thanks.

241
00:21:21,627 --> 00:21:25,539
I think clark might know something
about my cousin chloe's death.

242
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:28,943
I'm so sorry for your loss.

243
00:21:29,482 --> 00:21:30,779
Yeah.

244
00:21:31,803 --> 00:21:33,926
Were she and clark ever an item?

245
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:38,289
- Uh, I think for a minute, but...
- that's funny. I never thought she'd fallfor the farm boy type.

246
00:21:38,367 --> 00:21:41,415
Trust me, that can happen to the best of us.

247
00:21:41,455 --> 00:21:44,070
Not me. Give me a nerd with glasses any day of the week.

248
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,546
Clark has many sides.

249
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,065
Yeah, I've seen several of them already.
Speaking of clark,

250
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,779
- do you think he'll be upany time soon?
- I... I doubt it.

251
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:03,398
Right now he is my only chance
to get justice for chloe.

252
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,250
The fbi inquest closed last week.

253
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:09,102
They've ruled the explosion an accident.

254
00:22:09,318 --> 00:22:12,935
I mean, how many gas leaks
do you know of in safe houses?

255
00:22:13,683 --> 00:22:17,400
And in two weeks,
lionel luthor is going to walk free.

256
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:22,017
And chloe's death...

257
00:22:22,923 --> 00:22:25,145
it will have been for nothing.

258
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,254
I'll have clark call you
if he remembers anything.

259
00:22:32,969 --> 00:22:34,935
You know, chloe said in her notes

260
00:22:34,975 --> 00:22:36,940
that you used to work for lionel.

261
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:41,328
And I'm trying to get in to see him,
but he keeps refusing me.

262
00:22:41,602 --> 00:22:43,214
Any advice?

263
00:22:43,766 --> 00:22:45,221
Stay away.

264
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:48,074
You don't want to get pulled into lionel's web.

265
00:22:49,195 --> 00:22:51,141
How did you escape unscathed?

266
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:52,559
I didn'T.

267
00:22:59,516 --> 00:23:01,088
Goodbye, lois.

268
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:04,471
Bye.

269
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,742
Check this out.

270
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,220
What is it?

271
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,522
A bird, a plane?

272
00:24:19,047 --> 00:24:22,843
I'm afraid that the answers
that you're searching for

273
00:24:22,902 --> 00:24:25,182
won't be found in this barn.

274
00:24:27,162 --> 00:24:31,075
I'm bridgette crosby.
Dr. Swann sent me.

275
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:37,955
- You'll have to forgive me. I was.
- you were expecting to speak to dr. Swann personally.

276
00:24:38,192 --> 00:24:42,574
The matter I need to discuss with him
can't exactly be relayed through someone else.

277
00:24:42,632 --> 00:24:45,307
I can understand your hesitancy,

278
00:24:45,366 --> 00:24:47,898
discussing kal-el with a complete stranger.

279
00:24:47,939 --> 00:24:51,597
Dr. Swann promised clark that no one else knew.

280
00:24:51,636 --> 00:24:56,923
He promised that your son's secret would not leave
the confines of the foundation, and it hasn't.

281
00:24:56,982 --> 00:25:02,483
This was a mistake. I never should've called. I wish that
clark hadn't contacted dr. Swann in the first place.

282
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:07,006
Your son's destiny was set in motion

283
00:25:07,322 --> 00:25:09,328
long before their paths crossed.

284
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:13,100
You don't know anything about my son.

285
00:25:16,424 --> 00:25:17,761
You're right.

286
00:25:19,903 --> 00:25:21,495
You're right. I don'T.

287
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:28,144
But I do know what it's like to love somebody
whose calling is greater than your own.

288
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:32,398
You and dr. Swann?

289
00:25:33,363 --> 00:25:35,467
In a different lifetime.

290
00:25:37,631 --> 00:25:41,631
Martha, I can help you if you'll let me.

291
00:25:41,689 --> 00:25:45,760
- Now, where's your son?
- I don't know.

292
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:50,476
He flew.

293
00:25:50,713 --> 00:25:52,522
He flew away.

294
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:54,547
So he's...

295
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:58,540
he has completely embraced
his kryptonian destiny.

296
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:03,020
Do you know what that destiny is?

297
00:26:03,135 --> 00:26:05,022
No, but the symbol

298
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:07,277
burned into your field three months ago...

299
00:26:07,344 --> 00:26:11,336
that's the kryptonian symbol for "crusade. "

300
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:14,755
I don't know what jor-el did to him, but

301
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,956
I know, deep down, clark is still in there.

302
00:26:17,016 --> 00:26:21,908
Martha, the only challenge to a father's will...

303
00:26:22,843 --> 00:26:25,267
is a mother's love.

304
00:26:27,946 --> 00:26:31,696
I... I can't possibly face clark alone.

305
00:26:33,072 --> 00:26:35,196
You don't have to. Look.

306
00:26:40,117 --> 00:26:42,595
It's black kryptonite,

307
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:46,194
You're his only hope.

308
00:26:56,118 --> 00:26:58,262
Wow, dad, you are in great shape.

309
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:01,483
Lex, I've been reading about you.

310
00:27:01,523 --> 00:27:03,823
Interesting article.

311
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:11,899
You know, they, uh,

312
00:27:12,725 --> 00:27:15,576
they dubbed mussolinia savior.

313
00:27:18,074 --> 00:27:20,665
And look what happened to him.

314
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:26,034
Dad, if you want to blame someone
for luthorcorp's woes,

315
00:27:26,094 --> 00:27:28,218
why don't you lookin the mirror?

316
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:32,188
A ceo on trial for murder
usually erodes consumer confidence.

317
00:27:32,247 --> 00:27:35,964
Yeah... to go gallivanting around
the world on a fool's errand

318
00:27:36,082 --> 00:27:39,189
ain't gonna win any points with shareholders, either.

319
00:27:40,764 --> 00:27:42,651
I'm in a cage, lex.

320
00:27:42,711 --> 00:27:44,422
I'm not dead.

321
00:27:47,136 --> 00:27:49,516
Think I haven't been keeping tabs on you?

322
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:53,252
- Then how'd you do it?
- Do what?

323
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,458
Break into my jet at 20,000 feet.

324
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,223
You look pale, lex. Are you all right?

325
00:28:06,445 --> 00:28:07,802
Where is it?

326
00:28:09,927 --> 00:28:13,170
Honestly, lex, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

327
00:28:13,211 --> 00:28:15,944
Well, then perhaps I can refresh your memory.

328
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,812
Three artifacts

329
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:22,336
hidden around the world by scientifically
advanced ancient cultures

330
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:25,004
legend has it that, when united, they

331
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:30,373
they point the way to a treasury of knowledge
that puts the library of alexandria to shame.

332
00:28:36,685 --> 00:28:39,517
You're chasing a fairy tale, lex.

333
00:28:40,206 --> 00:28:45,076
A fairy tale you believed in enough to finance
six expeditions over the last two years.

334
00:28:45,158 --> 00:28:49,205
I funded several educational digs
through the luthorcorp foundation. So?

335
00:28:49,245 --> 00:28:50,444
So?

336
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:55,773
so they all focused on sites that unearthed
the same symbols as those on the cave wall.

337
00:29:01,611 --> 00:29:05,524
You think those artifacts can save your life, dad?

338
00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:14,179
I don't have time for foolishness, lex.
I'm about to stand trial for murder.

339
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:21,387
And when I'm cleared, those responsible for
putting me here will certainly feel my wrath.

340
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,921
Like chloe did?

341
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:27,132
Chloe sullivan

342
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:31,007
was killed in a tragic accident.
She didn't deserve to die.

343
00:29:31,046 --> 00:29:32,520
But I did?

344
00:29:34,094 --> 00:29:36,355
Is that why you poisoned my brandy?

345
00:29:36,415 --> 00:29:43,436
- Oh, what kind of a monster do you think I am?
- I lay there for 10 minutes before the paramedics came, dad, 10 minutes.

346
00:29:43,494 --> 00:29:48,022
They said that dosage would kill an ordinary man,
but apparently, I'm not ordinary.

347
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:50,146
No, you're not.

348
00:29:51,229 --> 00:29:52,860
You're my son.

349
00:29:54,316 --> 00:29:55,747
God help me.

350
00:30:00,095 --> 00:30:03,080
You shouldn't wound what you can't kill, dad.

351
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,556
What's going on? You were supposed to meet
me at 10:00. It's now 12:00.Are you okay?

352
00:31:45,622 --> 00:31:46,798
Yeah,

353
00:31:47,053 --> 00:31:48,745
I don't know how I got here.

354
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,850
I must've passed out.

355
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:52,639
I'll meet you downstairs.

356
00:32:16,732 --> 00:32:19,068
You shouldn't have come here, martha kent.

357
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,211
Clark...

358
00:32:24,355 --> 00:32:27,167
if you're still in there, I love you.

359
00:32:52,243 --> 00:32:54,111
Humanity has made you weak.

360
00:32:54,564 --> 00:32:55,763
Clark!

361
00:33:21,754 --> 00:33:22,914
Clark?

362
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,214
Clark?

363
00:33:30,086 --> 00:33:32,662
It's me, mom. I'm back.

364
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:57,288
What'd the doctors say?

365
00:33:58,685 --> 00:34:02,087
Well, she said that your father is A...

366
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:04,566
walking, breathing miracle.

367
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:08,224
And that's thanks to you.

368
00:34:08,912 --> 00:34:10,741
The real hero's mom.

369
00:34:12,728 --> 00:34:15,280
If it wasn't for her, I'd still be kal-el.

370
00:34:18,506 --> 00:34:20,000
Son...

371
00:34:22,204 --> 00:34:24,904
do you remember anything
that happened after you...

372
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:27,008
got pulled into that wall?

373
00:34:27,015 --> 00:34:29,375
I just remember that last couple of days.

374
00:34:30,005 --> 00:34:32,184
Even that'sa little jumbled.

375
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:33,560
Clark...

376
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,947
your mother tells me you...

377
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:39,874
can fly?

378
00:34:41,198 --> 00:34:42,870
Kal-el can fly.

379
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:45,485
Clark kent is still earthbound.

380
00:34:46,882 --> 00:34:48,494
How did that feel?

381
00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:52,802
Amazing.

382
00:34:54,264 --> 00:34:56,132
And scary...

383
00:34:56,979 --> 00:35:00,067
because if I can do that,
maybe I'm capable of anything.

384
00:35:00,102 --> 00:35:01,596
You are.

385
00:35:04,133 --> 00:35:05,981
No, that's you, mom.

386
00:35:07,162 --> 00:35:13,413
Cause I don't know if I would've had the strength to hold on for
three months, not knowing where I was and if dad would pull through.

387
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:16,540
Well, my father used to tell me,

388
00:35:16,596 --> 00:35:19,879
life asks of you what it thinks you can handle.

389
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:23,066
There were days

390
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:25,973
when I thought that it had asked too much.

391
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:28,018
But then I would think about

392
00:35:28,058 --> 00:35:30,260
this family and...

393
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,210
all the things we've endured

394
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,782
and the good things ahead of us.

395
00:35:36,362 --> 00:35:40,335
And I found the strength to keep going because...

396
00:35:41,495 --> 00:35:44,896
I knew the three of us would be together again.

397
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,636
You're not martha kent.

398
00:37:18,893 --> 00:37:21,743
Would you have seen me
if they said it was lois lane?

399
00:37:21,803 --> 00:37:24,241
Lois lane. Yes.

400
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,928
You're chloe sullivan's cousin.

401
00:37:33,575 --> 00:37:35,463
What a loss.

402
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:39,101
You bite your nails. Bad girl.

403
00:37:39,339 --> 00:37:42,225
But getting through the door
doesn't mean I'll talk to you.

404
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:43,524
Guard?

405
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,594
I don't believe that safe house
explosion was an accident.

406
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:51,184
Of course you don't.
You believe I'm responsible.

407
00:37:51,584 --> 00:37:52,764
No.

408
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:55,595
A stunt like that is...

409
00:37:55,635 --> 00:37:57,976
thuggish and obvious.

410
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:00,669
It smacks of desperation

411
00:38:01,555 --> 00:38:04,040
all the things you aren't.

412
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:08,072
All right, miss lane, you have my attention.
What's your theory?

413
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,822
I don't have one.

414
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:13,692
Then why are you here?

415
00:38:15,483 --> 00:38:21,048
Because I wanted to look into the face of the son of
a bitch who's responsible for my cousin's death.

416
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,401
You may not have blown her up,

417
00:38:25,815 --> 00:38:27,644
but you're the reason she's gone.

418
00:38:27,703 --> 00:38:34,023
Before you begin to anoint her for sainthood,
let's get some of the facts straight, all right?

419
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:36,815
The simple truth is,

420
00:38:36,855 --> 00:38:38,940
I made her an offer, she took it.

421
00:38:38,979 --> 00:38:42,067
I kept my end of the bargain, she didn'T.

422
00:38:43,527 --> 00:38:49,446
She's dead as a result of her own actions.
I had nothing to do with it.

423
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:56,775
And the next time you come at me with accusations,
try to have a little more than righteous indignation.

424
00:39:00,374 --> 00:39:03,816
Zoo hours are over, miss lane. Good day.

425
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:13,101
You know,

426
00:39:14,675 --> 00:39:18,705
it must kill you that somebody has given you this gift.

427
00:39:18,764 --> 00:39:21,930
And you don't know who
and you don't know why, but

428
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:26,570
without chloe's testimony, you're probably
gonna walk out of here a free man.

429
00:39:28,654 --> 00:39:30,995
Or are you being set up?

430
00:39:55,884 --> 00:39:57,650
I have a confession to make.

431
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,400
I didn't go to your funeral.

432
00:40:00,207 --> 00:40:01,937
I hate funerals.

433
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,359
Dad says everybody does,

434
00:40:06,812 --> 00:40:11,059
but it's a way of paying tribute to a life well-led.

435
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:24,765
I hate myself for being weak.

436
00:40:26,128 --> 00:40:29,137
I just knew that, the moment I came here,

437
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:31,399
it would make it real.

438
00:40:33,858 --> 00:40:36,910
I promise I'll find out who did this to you...

439
00:40:37,964 --> 00:40:40,717
even if I have to do it alone.

440
00:40:41,092 --> 00:40:42,625
You're not alone.

441
00:40:45,172 --> 00:40:49,262
A fact you could've shared before
you were breathing down my neck.

442
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:52,291
I'm sorry, lois. I didn't know you were out here.

443
00:41:02,925 --> 00:41:07,626
Glad to seewe've moved beyond the
clothing-optional stage of our relationship.

444
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:10,714
I'm surprised you even
remember who I am.

445
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:12,917
Chloe's cousin.

446
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:18,086
Nicorette addiction,
can't stand uncomfortable silences...

447
00:41:18,441 --> 00:41:22,080
I guess this means your
synapses are all firing again.

448
00:41:24,852 --> 00:41:28,784
Look, I can't
explain my actions over the past few days.

449
00:41:31,814 --> 00:41:33,918
But chloe was my best friend.

450
00:41:34,547 --> 00:41:36,710
You're not the only one who misses her.

451
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:39,948
I'm just the only one doing
something about it.

452
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:43,743
I get the feeling you like to do things yourself.

453
00:41:44,157 --> 00:41:46,930
My dad raised me to be independent and self-sufficient.

454
00:41:46,989 --> 00:41:49,207
That would be one way to describe you.

455
00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:52,964
You know, the only thing I like about you
at the moment is your mom.

456
00:41:53,062 --> 00:41:57,083
You can't possibly beas weird as I think
you are with a mom that cool.

457
00:41:58,952 --> 00:42:02,059
Look, why don't you let me help,
find out who did this to chloe?

458
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:04,537
Come on, you can stay
at our house while you're in town.

459
00:42:06,977 --> 00:42:09,418
It beats living out of your car.

460
00:42:13,345 --> 00:42:14,288
Thanks.

461
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:20,023
But you should know I don't pay attention
to curfews, and I never make my bed.

462
00:42:20,398 --> 00:42:22,167
I'll give you some time alone.

463
00:42:52,968 --> 00:42:54,187
Lois!

464
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,377
Chloe's still alive.

465
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:03,476
