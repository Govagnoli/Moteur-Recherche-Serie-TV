1
00:00:23,212 --> 00:00:25,976
Mr. Luthor, what can I
do for you today?

2
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:28,378
I want to close all my accounts.

3
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:31,610
May I ask why?

4
00:00:31,787 --> 00:00:35,348
-Is there a problem?
-No. No, of course not.

5
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:40,393
It's just that the Luthors
have been banking here for 12 years.

6
00:00:40,563 --> 00:00:44,590
-It's quite a shock.
-I'd like it all in cash.

7
00:00:46,102 --> 00:00:48,036
We'll do our best.

8
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:53,633
-Can I get your signature?
-Certainly.

9
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:19,893
Mr. Luthor...

10
00:01:21,404 --> 00:01:24,396
...may I see your driver's license, please?

11
00:01:25,174 --> 00:01:26,903
Why?

12
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:30,773
This signature doesn't match our records.
I just need to verify your ID.

13
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:33,882
I'm standing right here in front of you.
What more do you need?

14
00:01:34,617 --> 00:01:36,278
I'm sorry. It's bank policy.

15
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:38,787
I need the money now.

16
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,817
Fill the bag!

17
00:01:54,737 --> 00:01:55,897
Lex, what's going on?

18
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:57,767
Get out of my way!

19
00:02:32,608 --> 00:02:35,042
Tina, where did you get this?

20
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:37,871
Promised I'd solve all of our problems.

21
00:02:38,047 --> 00:02:41,244
Please tell me
you didn't rob the bank yesterday.

22
00:02:41,684 --> 00:02:42,946
I didn't.

23
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:51,386
Lex Luthor did.

24
00:02:52,428 --> 00:02:55,864
Stop it. Stop it, Tina. You promised
that you wouldn't do that anymore.

25
00:02:56,032 --> 00:02:58,933
-I did it for us.
-Somebody could have gotten hurt!

26
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:02,400
Mom, I'm fine. Now we can
afford to have the perfect life.

27
00:03:02,571 --> 00:03:06,007
-Tina, nobody's life is perfect.
-Lana's is.

28
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:08,773
Stealing isn't the way
to solve our problems.

29
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:11,506
I'm taking it back.
I'll say I found it in a dumpster.

30
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,978
No, Mom, come on!
We deserve to be happy!

31
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,310
Come on!

32
00:03:21,991 --> 00:03:23,015
Mom!

33
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:46,806
<i>911 emergency.</i>

34
00:03:48,684 --> 00:03:49,878
<i>Hello, is anyone there?</i>

35
00:03:50,686 --> 00:03:53,621
<i>Hello. Hello, is anyone there?</i>

36
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:55,552
Sorry.

37
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,217
It's nothing.

38
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,742
This is incredible. Why would
Lex Luthor need to rob a bank?

39
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,981
I've seen some pretty strange things
in my day, but this definitely takes the cake.

40
00:05:02,158 --> 00:05:03,147
Well, almost.

41
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:05,657
He got away with $ 100,000.

42
00:05:05,828 --> 00:05:07,489
I know Lex. It wasn't him.

43
00:05:07,663 --> 00:05:11,258
Clark, I know that he's a friend of yours,
but you saw him with your own eyes.

44
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:12,923
I don't know what I saw.

45
00:05:13,102 --> 00:05:16,401
There must be some kind of reasonable
explanation for this, I hope.

46
00:05:16,572 --> 00:05:19,700
Me too. I'd hate to think
I have an evil twin.

47
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,668
Lex, we didn't hear you pull up.

48
00:05:22,845 --> 00:05:25,871
May I come in?
I promise I'm not packing heat.

49
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:28,342
Lex, how come you're not in jail?

50
00:05:28,517 --> 00:05:32,681
Because I was hosting a reception
for 200 fertilizer distributors in Metropolis...

51
00:05:32,855 --> 00:05:35,688
-...at the time of the robbery.
-The police have any leads?

52
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:39,487
None. That's why I wanted to talk to you.
Your name was on the witness list.

53
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:43,063
-Did you actually see this person?
-Yeah, he looked just like you.

54
00:05:43,232 --> 00:05:45,928
Except his fingerprints and signature
didn't match mine.

55
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:49,035
Are you sure your eyes
weren't playing tricks on you?

56
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:51,268
What's gonna happen now?

57
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,271
Hopefully, the money will turn up.

58
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:55,976
In the meantime,
the tabloids will have a field day.

59
00:05:56,145 --> 00:06:00,741
I'm sure certain people's opinions of me
will be cemented in stone.

60
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,383
I gotta get to work.

61
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:08,614
I'm sorry you got thrown
through that window.

62
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,988
-I promise, I'm not a criminal mastermind.
-I know.

63
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:14,823
A criminal mastermind
would have worn a mask.

64
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:26,998
Come on. Move it. That's the stuff.
Come on, you can do it. Hustle.

65
00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:31,237
Get on up there. Get on up there.
You can do it. That's the stuff.

66
00:06:31,413 --> 00:06:33,074
Let's go. Come on.

67
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:39,185
Let's go. Hustle, hustle, hustle.

68
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:41,823
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

69
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,889
Keep your eyes in your head, man.

70
00:06:46,028 --> 00:06:47,461
Kent!

71
00:06:47,663 --> 00:06:49,255
Are we boring you?

72
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:52,656
I'm sorry. My head hurts.

73
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:54,530
You need to get some blood pumping.

74
00:06:54,703 --> 00:06:56,830
You and Ross are next.
Come on down, boys.

75
00:06:57,473 --> 00:06:59,373
Come on. Put a little muscle into it.

76
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,475
Ross beats you, it's 10 laps.

77
00:07:01,844 --> 00:07:04,870
Come on, Clark. Let's go.
Move it, move it.

78
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:06,844
Looks like someone's doing laps.

79
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:12,515
Clark, man, what's wrong?

80
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:16,454
Clark, man, what's wrong?

81
00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:18,215
Clark!

82
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:22,453
Kent, are you all right?
Kent, what happened up there?

83
00:07:48,691 --> 00:07:53,060
So when you have these flashes, you can
see through anything? People, objects?

84
00:07:53,228 --> 00:07:55,924
Sometimes I see through things.
Other times, it's like an x-ray.

85
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:57,827
There's no warning?
This just happens?

86
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,025
Well, I get a headache,
and then it hits me.

87
00:08:00,202 --> 00:08:03,035
The first time, I thought I was hallucinating.
Then it happened again.

88
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:05,503
Clark, I'm sure there's some way
to control this.

89
00:08:05,674 --> 00:08:09,166
You guys, I can see through things.
How do you control that?

90
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:12,610
You gotta practice, Clark. Your eyes
have muscles just like your legs.

91
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:14,772
Your mom is right, son.

92
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,578
All you have to do is
you have to figure out a way...

93
00:08:17,753 --> 00:08:20,551
...to condition them so that
you don't get these random flashes.

94
00:08:20,723 --> 00:08:22,350
That sounds great.

95
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:24,491
How am I gonna do that?

96
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,901
Lana, you have a visitor.

97
00:08:34,536 --> 00:08:35,730
Hey, Lana.

98
00:08:35,904 --> 00:08:38,600
Tina, I didn't see you at school today.
Is everything okay?

99
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:41,671
Yeah. My mom's not feeling well.

100
00:08:41,844 --> 00:08:43,937
But she's better, so....

101
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:50,041
So you quit cheerleading
and Nell banishes you to the garage.

102
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:53,552
She's got clutter issues.
I'm trying to help resolve them.

103
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:56,816
-Has she forgiven you for quitting the squad?
-Not yet.

104
00:08:56,992 --> 00:09:01,292
Well, at least now you have some more
time for your unpopular friends.

105
00:09:01,497 --> 00:09:03,897
Tina, you're not unpopular.

106
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,661
What happened to the girl who didn't
care what people thought about her?

107
00:09:08,837 --> 00:09:10,304
She went to high school.

108
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,272
At least your mom doesn't try
to run your life.

109
00:09:15,611 --> 00:09:18,808
You know, you're lucky
that Nell cares about you.

110
00:09:18,981 --> 00:09:21,711
If something were to happen to my mom...

111
00:09:21,884 --> 00:09:23,351
...nobody would take me in.

112
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,716
I'd probably be shipped off
to a foster home or something.

113
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:30,825
-Thanks for that burst of cheer.
-Well, what do you want me to say?

114
00:09:30,993 --> 00:09:33,086
You have the perfect life.

115
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:35,355
You want it? You can have it.

116
00:09:36,598 --> 00:09:38,964
I'd settle for the outfit.

117
00:09:40,736 --> 00:09:43,296
Wouldn't it be cool if we were sisters?

118
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:49,377
If anything happened to my mom,
do you think that Nell would adopt me?

119
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:51,706
Tina, nothing's gonna happen
to your mom.

120
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,884
Did it happen again?

121
00:10:30,486 --> 00:10:33,319
-Let's go home.
-No, I'm okay.

122
00:10:34,223 --> 00:10:36,418
Didn't you need to go to the antique store?

123
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:41,153
Hello?

124
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:49,028
Mrs. Kent-- I mean, Martha.
How are you?

125
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:51,866
-Good. How's business?
-Couldn't be better.

126
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,271
I'm doing so many estate sales in Metropolis,
I'm thinking of selling the place.

127
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:58,038
That would be a shame.
I thought you loved this store.

128
00:10:58,213 --> 00:11:01,512
Not really. I never wanted this life.
It just kind of happened.

129
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:03,412
Is Tina around?
I thought I saw her come in.

130
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:06,418
She's at Lana's.
They're inseparable these days.

131
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:09,883
-Really? I could have sworn that--
-You must be seeing things.

132
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,824
I need some air.
I'm gonna go for a walk.

133
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:19,195
-I came by to pick up the lamp.
-Lamp?

134
00:11:20,102 --> 00:11:22,627
The one you were restoring for Jonathan?

135
00:11:22,804 --> 00:11:26,103
Oh, yes. Silly me. It's in the back.

136
00:11:48,196 --> 00:11:50,289
It's not quite ready, it's--

137
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:53,795
I found this under the chest.

138
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:57,264
I'm such an airhead.

139
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,405
A client paid me in cash.
I've been looking for this all day.

140
00:12:01,577 --> 00:12:03,772
That's a lot of money.
You should be careful.

141
00:12:03,946 --> 00:12:08,383
Thanks. Why don't you stop by next week,
it'll be ready then.

142
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:15,415
Mrs. Kent, you forgot your purse.

143
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:18,082
Looks like we're both airheads today.

144
00:12:20,128 --> 00:12:21,618
Bye.

145
00:12:58,667 --> 00:12:59,964
Clark!

146
00:13:10,646 --> 00:13:12,580
Mom, are you all right?

147
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:14,847
Clark!

148
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:28,090
Police found the truck.
Abandoned out by the Stewart farm.

149
00:13:28,263 --> 00:13:30,754
-Did anybody else see the driver?
-No.

150
00:13:30,932 --> 00:13:32,763
I could have sworn it was you, Clark.

151
00:13:32,934 --> 00:13:34,868
I guess I'm not the only one
with a vision problem.

152
00:13:35,037 --> 00:13:37,301
I don't understand.
How did they get your keys?

153
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:40,168
I have no idea.
I only went into the antique--

154
00:13:41,343 --> 00:13:42,469
What is it, Mom?

155
00:13:42,844 --> 00:13:46,575
Nothing. It's just that Rose Greer
was acting very strange.

156
00:13:46,748 --> 00:13:49,478
I found $5000 in cash under a dresser.

157
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:55,021
It had a Smallville Savings and Loan band
on it. She said a customer paid her, but--

158
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,681
-You think it's from the robbery?
-It crossed my mind.

159
00:13:57,859 --> 00:14:01,522
Wait. Rose took your keys, turned into Clark,
and then tried to run you down?

160
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,161
-You're right, it's crazy.
-I don't think so.

161
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:07,223
What?

162
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:10,204
I saw a flash of Tina Greer's skeleton.

163
00:14:10,372 --> 00:14:12,203
It was weird and green.

164
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:15,901
It didn't look human. You know,
like the ones you see in anatomy books?

165
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:20,139
That's probably because Tina
was born with a soft-bone disease.

166
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:25,412
They had her on all these experimental drugs.
Doctors didn't believe she'd see first grade.

167
00:14:25,587 --> 00:14:28,385
She did get better,
right around her 3rd birthday.

168
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:31,325
Right after the meteor shower,
wasn't it?

169
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,649
Yeah.

170
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:38,295
-Clark, what do you think Tina's doing?
-I don't know.

171
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:43,165
I saw the same weird skeleton flash
just after the robbery...I think.

172
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:46,073
I just wish I could control this.

173
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:50,041
What if you try focusing it,
you know, like a telescope?

174
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:54,242
You could start with something small.

175
00:14:56,718 --> 00:15:00,119
Try to tell me what I have
in my hand right now.

176
00:15:02,057 --> 00:15:03,388
It's your pocketknife.

177
00:15:05,827 --> 00:15:08,057
You could see through my hand.

178
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,926
No, you always carry your knife
in that pocket.

179
00:16:15,864 --> 00:16:17,559
Sweetie, what's wrong?

180
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:20,764
You lied to me about my mother.

181
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:33,973
<i>-May I help you?
-Roger Nixon, Metropolis Inquisitor.</i>

182
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:35,616
Get off my car.

183
00:16:35,784 --> 00:16:38,685
It's a hell of a picture, Lex.
It really boosted our sales.

184
00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:41,345
I've read comic books
with less fiction than your rag.

185
00:16:41,523 --> 00:16:43,718
Well, how about this?
Is this fiction?

186
00:16:43,892 --> 00:16:46,360
It's your juvenile record.
Fascinating reading.

187
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:49,793
Must have taken a truck of your dad's
money to keep those people quiet.

188
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:51,227
Those records are sealed.

189
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,730
I'm a resourceful guy.

190
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:58,196
I saw that picture yesterday,
and it got me to thinking of a follow-up.

191
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:03,374
"Lex Luthor's Wild Youth in Metropolis."
Does the name Club Zero ring a bell?

192
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:06,946
-You print one word about that, I'll sue.
-Lawsuits take years.

193
00:17:07,115 --> 00:17:10,482
The genie will be out of the bottle,
and all the people will know...

194
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:14,418
...that the new and improved Lex Luthor
is nothing but a facade.

195
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:17,223
You know what I think, Rog?

196
00:17:17,726 --> 00:17:21,127
If you wanted to print that,
it would already be in the paper.

197
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:25,229
-I think you're looking for a payoff.
-It's a business proposition.

198
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,834
$ 100,000 and these records
will disappear forever.

199
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:30,995
I'd question your integrity,
but you're a journalist.

200
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,903
Did your father really think
he could hide you here forever?

201
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:37,576
You've got 24 hours,
and this hits the front page.

202
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:51,318
Lana, I didn't lie to you.

203
00:17:51,493 --> 00:17:54,826
I told you your mother would have been
proud of you, and she would have.

204
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:56,653
She loved you.

205
00:17:57,832 --> 00:18:01,131
You told me a fairy tale
about a woman who led the perfect life.

206
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:03,066
Bu that life was a lie.

207
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:07,197
You said she loved cheerleading.
She hated it, but was afraid to quit.

208
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:10,435
She didn't want to stay in Smallville.
She wanted to see the world.

209
00:18:10,612 --> 00:18:12,876
Should I have told you
your mother was unhappy?

210
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:14,712
I would have liked the truth.

211
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:17,374
I told you what I thought
you could handle.

212
00:18:18,186 --> 00:18:21,622
Your mother was like any other teenager.
She had her ups and her downs.

213
00:18:21,856 --> 00:18:26,691
I feel like I spent my entire life trying to
measure up to a Laura Lang who didn't exist.

214
00:18:26,861 --> 00:18:30,194
You're reading the diary
of a 17-year-old girl.

215
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:33,300
It's a snapshot.
It's one time in her life.

216
00:18:33,468 --> 00:18:35,766
It's like I wrote this myself.

217
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,940
The truth is, your mother was the brightest,
most beautiful girl in her class.

218
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:44,135
Do you know she was picked
to give the graduation speech?

219
00:18:44,813 --> 00:18:47,748
I guess the diary ended
before that happened.

220
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,682
You should have heard the speech
she gave that day.

221
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:52,977
What did she say?

222
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:57,315
Everything that had been bubbling up
inside her for 18 years.

223
00:18:57,592 --> 00:19:00,720
She said she felt suffocated in Smallville.

224
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,324
-Do you have a copy?
-No.

225
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:07,265
But I'll never forget the first line.

226
00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:10,064
"I never made a difference here...

227
00:19:10,605 --> 00:19:13,267
...but maybe my children can."

228
00:19:46,808 --> 00:19:48,537
Hello, Clark.

229
00:19:50,712 --> 00:19:52,407
Is everything okay?

230
00:19:52,614 --> 00:19:55,310
You guys ever notice anything strange
about Tina Greer?

231
00:19:57,352 --> 00:20:01,015
Nothing that would require the intense
concentration you're exerting to look at her.

232
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:05,585
The only thing weird about Tina is the
amount of time she spends idolizing Lana.

233
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,819
She's practically her clone.

234
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,389
Come on. Let's go.

235
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:24,340
Lana!

236
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:28,046
-I swear, that girl's got you LoJacked.
-How do you like the sweater?

237
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:31,185
It's great. I've got one just like it.

238
00:20:31,352 --> 00:20:34,685
I know. I got it at the same store.
I've been going on a shopping spree.

239
00:20:34,856 --> 00:20:38,724
Look, I even found this emerald necklace
in the antique store.

240
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:40,554
Why am I not surprised?

241
00:20:42,964 --> 00:20:44,591
See you at lunch.

242
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:46,994
Hey, are you okay?

243
00:20:47,168 --> 00:20:50,934
I stopped by your house earlier and Nell
said you weren't in the best mood, so....

244
00:20:51,106 --> 00:20:54,735
-I'm fine. Don't worry about it.
-Good, because I need a favor.

245
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:59,608
My mom's moving to Metropolis full-time,
but she doesn't wanna pull me out of school.

246
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:03,217
So I was thinking I can move in
with you and Nell.

247
00:21:03,952 --> 00:21:05,544
For how long?

248
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,315
I don't know. A couple months.
I mean, my mom would pay you guys.

249
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:12,824
Trust me, money is not a problem.
Just name your price.

250
00:21:12,994 --> 00:21:15,724
I could even get a horse.
We could go riding together.

251
00:21:15,897 --> 00:21:17,489
I mean, wouldn't that be cool?

252
00:21:17,665 --> 00:21:20,930
Yeah. Just give me some time
to think about it.

253
00:21:21,703 --> 00:21:25,264
-Are you sure your mom's okay with this?
-Of course.

254
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,408
She knows that we're best friends.

255
00:21:27,775 --> 00:21:29,709
It was her idea.

256
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:32,641
Just let me run it by Nell first.
She's kind of particular--

257
00:21:32,814 --> 00:21:34,509
Nell loves me.

258
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:38,077
Look, I don't understand.
I thought that you'd be happy.

259
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:41,279
People even say that we look alike.
We could be sisters.

260
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:44,524
I'm just not sure it's such a good idea.

261
00:21:45,426 --> 00:21:47,656
Okay, I see. So it was all a lie?

262
00:21:47,829 --> 00:21:50,297
You were pretending to like me,
then when I come to you...

263
00:21:50,465 --> 00:21:52,330
...in my hour of need,
you blow me off?

264
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:55,325
-Tina, calm down.
-You should have said yes, Lana.

265
00:21:56,137 --> 00:21:58,105
It would have been perfect.

266
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:51,083
What's your glitch, huh?
Why do you keep staring at me?

267
00:22:51,993 --> 00:22:53,358
I don't know.

268
00:22:54,963 --> 00:22:56,396
Sorry.

269
00:23:02,637 --> 00:23:06,368
-What are you doing home so early?
-Having more vision problems?

270
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:08,065
I controlled it.

271
00:23:08,276 --> 00:23:11,245
Once. Sort of.
I concentrated, and it worked.

272
00:23:11,412 --> 00:23:12,936
-Great!
-What'd you concentrate on?

273
00:23:13,114 --> 00:23:15,878
-Tina Greer's locker.
-What did you see?

274
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,608
The money from the bank robbery.

275
00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:40,131
I was just locking up, deputies.
How can I help you?

276
00:23:40,642 --> 00:23:42,542
We're looking for your daughter.

277
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,042
She hasn't come home yet.
What's the problem?

278
00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:49,773
The stolen money was recovered
in her school locker this afternoon.

279
00:23:49,951 --> 00:23:51,578
You're kidding.

280
00:23:51,753 --> 00:23:53,186
My Tina?

281
00:23:53,354 --> 00:23:55,379
How could she be involved in this?

282
00:23:55,556 --> 00:23:57,524
That's what we'd like to ask her.

283
00:23:57,692 --> 00:24:00,217
Would you bring her to the station
when she gets home?

284
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:03,387
Certainly. We'll cooperate
in any way we can.

285
00:24:03,564 --> 00:24:07,000
By the way, who told you
the money was in her locker?

286
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,432
Some kid with an anonymous tip.

287
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:19,610
Clark, what are you doing?

288
00:24:19,781 --> 00:24:22,716
I'm just trying to figure out
how much change I have inside.

289
00:24:22,884 --> 00:24:25,614
You could always take it out
and count it.

290
00:24:27,155 --> 00:24:29,123
Where's the fun in that?

291
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,948
Did you hear about Tina?

292
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:33,889
They found the money
from the robbery in her locker.

293
00:24:34,062 --> 00:24:35,552
Really?

294
00:24:35,863 --> 00:24:40,357
She actually cornered me today and asked
if she could come live with me and Nell.

295
00:24:40,535 --> 00:24:42,594
Just what you need,
a bank-robbing roommate.

296
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,670
I told her it wasn't such a good idea.

297
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:48,104
I've got enough problems with Nell
without adding more to the mix.

298
00:24:48,276 --> 00:24:50,710
I always thought you and your aunt
were really close.

299
00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:54,104
She wants me to be something I'm not.

300
00:24:56,284 --> 00:24:58,252
It's like having a dual identity.

301
00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:01,411
There's the person
that everybody sees...

302
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:04,023
...and the person that you wanna be.

303
00:25:08,162 --> 00:25:10,130
I know the feeling.

304
00:25:10,298 --> 00:25:12,357
That's why I came here.

305
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:16,560
I think you're the only person
who sees me for who I truly am.

306
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:20,137
I want to thank you for that.

307
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:26,379
-What about Whitney?
-Forget Whitney.

308
00:25:28,182 --> 00:25:32,915
I've had my eye on you,
just like you've had your eye on me.

309
00:25:39,927 --> 00:25:42,191
I don't know how you found out
about that money...

310
00:25:42,363 --> 00:25:45,196
...but you should have stayed
out of my life, Clark.

311
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:05,611
Well, there's no sign
of Tina or Lana or....

312
00:26:05,787 --> 00:26:08,847
Are you positive you saw her
turn back into Tina?

313
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,858
I think the meteor shower
did something to her bones.

314
00:26:12,026 --> 00:26:16,360
-So she can change appearance at will?
-Yeah, and it gives her strength.

315
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:18,499
-What should we tell the police?
-Nothing.

316
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,424
Tina can turn into whoever she wants...

317
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:22,967
...and I'm the only one
who can tell the difference.

318
00:26:27,008 --> 00:26:30,842
Pete, you throw that rubber spider again
and I'm going for my staple gun.

319
00:26:31,012 --> 00:26:32,707
Mind if I come in?

320
00:26:33,347 --> 00:26:37,443
The girl who writes for the pom-pom
parade is, no surprise, out with mono.

321
00:26:38,753 --> 00:26:40,380
This week's editorial?

322
00:26:41,422 --> 00:26:45,256
My semiannual
"Where are our priorities?" rant.

323
00:26:45,426 --> 00:26:49,487
For what it's worth, I really like what
you've done with the paper this year.

324
00:26:49,764 --> 00:26:52,562
Well, that puts you
in the majority of one.

325
00:26:54,402 --> 00:26:56,029
I'm sorry about the pom-pom crack.

326
00:26:56,204 --> 00:26:59,139
Once I hit take-no-prisoners mode,
it's hard to shut it off.

327
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:00,968
Actually, I admire it.

328
00:27:02,477 --> 00:27:04,377
You know who you are,
and you go for it.

329
00:27:05,546 --> 00:27:07,741
Well, I appreciate the compliment.

330
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:11,407
However, I know you haven't come down
to this hole to give me a pep talk.

331
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:14,885
<i>The Torch prints the graduation speech
every year, right?</i>

332
00:27:15,056 --> 00:27:18,389
Having transcribed last year's snore-fest,
that's an unfortunate yes.

333
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,289
-What year?
-1977.

334
00:27:22,163 --> 00:27:23,528
That's P.C.

335
00:27:23,698 --> 00:27:26,360
-P.C.?
-Pre-computer. When disco ruled the earth.

336
00:27:26,534 --> 00:27:28,297
Anything before then is gonna be H.C.

337
00:27:28,469 --> 00:27:31,165
-Hard copy.
-You catch on fast.

338
00:27:31,973 --> 00:27:33,736
Let's see.

339
00:27:33,941 --> 00:27:35,272
'77, here we go.

340
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:43,348
"Saturday Night Fever" was their prom
theme. Styx won group of the century....

341
00:27:43,518 --> 00:27:47,750
Wow. Someone got in the administration's
collective face.

342
00:27:47,922 --> 00:27:50,857
"Due to the controversial nature
of this year's graduation address...

343
00:27:51,025 --> 00:27:54,722
<i>...the editors have elected not to run
the text in this issue of the Torch."</i>

344
00:27:54,896 --> 00:27:58,263
Meaning, ironically, it's probably
the only one worth reading.

345
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:02,826
Maybe I could track something down for you.
Do you know who gave this speech?

346
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:07,068
My mother.

347
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:25,491
Can I fix you a drink?

348
00:28:25,826 --> 00:28:28,192
I'd just as soon get my money
and get out.

349
00:28:28,663 --> 00:28:30,153
Of course.

350
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:31,992
I assume I don't have to count it?

351
00:28:33,067 --> 00:28:34,625
I've even supplied the bag.

352
00:28:40,174 --> 00:28:43,610
You're feeling pretty good
about yourself right now, aren't you?

353
00:28:45,146 --> 00:28:49,242
You'd think with all the money my father
spent, he could make things disappear.

354
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,514
Maybe he's not as smart as he thinks.

355
00:28:54,722 --> 00:28:56,713
The original.

356
00:28:57,658 --> 00:28:59,216
Have a nice life.

357
00:28:59,827 --> 00:29:02,694
If you walk out that door,
I will make you disappear.

358
00:29:04,832 --> 00:29:08,165
What are you going to do?
You gonna have me killed?

359
00:29:09,003 --> 00:29:12,029
No, you'll be very much alive.

360
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,534
But there won't be any evidence
of your existence.

361
00:29:15,776 --> 00:29:17,243
What are you talking about?

362
00:29:17,411 --> 00:29:22,110
Driver's license, passport, social security
number, bank account, will all be erased.

363
00:29:22,483 --> 00:29:26,783
With one call, I can ensure that there will be
no record that you actually walked this earth.

364
00:29:28,322 --> 00:29:29,619
You're bluffing.

365
00:29:31,258 --> 00:29:34,421
Call your bank.
See if your account still exists.

366
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,356
That is, if your cell phone
hasn't already been disconnected.

367
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:46,431
What did you do?

368
00:29:46,641 --> 00:29:50,202
Don't worry, Roger.
I'm gonna give you a new identity.

369
00:29:50,378 --> 00:29:53,006
One that's a little less upstanding.

370
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:55,144
Maybe a murderer.

371
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:56,543
Maybe a drug dealer.

372
00:29:56,717 --> 00:29:59,652
Either way, you lose your job,
your house and your family.

373
00:30:02,823 --> 00:30:04,654
I'll give the money back.

374
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,821
Then we'll be even.

375
00:30:07,995 --> 00:30:09,428
No, we won't.

376
00:30:09,697 --> 00:30:13,394
Because I also know your brother
works for Juvenile Court.

377
00:30:13,701 --> 00:30:18,161
What'd you tell him? Steal the records
and you can make some quick cash?

378
00:30:18,372 --> 00:30:21,239
-He could do time for that.
-Leave him out of this.

379
00:30:21,942 --> 00:30:25,844
I didn't get him involved, Roger.
You did.

380
00:30:27,014 --> 00:30:30,177
You came into my life
thinking you could shake me down...

381
00:30:30,351 --> 00:30:33,752
...because I was some spoiled, rich brat
who needed his daddy's protection.

382
00:30:36,057 --> 00:30:39,959
Trust me, when I make things disappear,
they stay buried.

383
00:30:40,861 --> 00:30:42,522
What do you want from me?

384
00:30:44,098 --> 00:30:45,463
Your help.

385
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:49,469
<i>My father's obsessed
with the Daily Planet.</i>

386
00:30:50,004 --> 00:30:54,100
<i>But I know the Inquisitor's read by the
people. They're the ones I'm interested in.</i>

387
00:30:54,608 --> 00:30:56,633
I will feed you stories.
You will print them.

388
00:30:56,811 --> 00:31:01,214
Any negative stories about me, you will kill.
You will be at my disposal, 24/7.

389
00:31:01,382 --> 00:31:03,009
Follow me.

390
00:31:16,497 --> 00:31:21,093
-What happened to your car?
-I drove it off a bridge at 60 miles an hour.

391
00:31:21,702 --> 00:31:23,897
How are you still alive?

392
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:26,869
That's the mystery I need your help solving.

393
00:31:51,098 --> 00:31:52,565
Clark, what's wrong?

394
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:55,099
Why are you looking at me like that?

395
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:58,167
Sorry, it's nothing.
I wasn't sure it was you.

396
00:31:59,473 --> 00:32:02,340
-This is a bad time.
-No.

397
00:32:05,146 --> 00:32:09,207
I was out jogging, didn't wanna go home,
kind of ended up here.

398
00:32:10,351 --> 00:32:12,376
You and Nell are still fighting.

399
00:32:12,787 --> 00:32:13,947
How'd you know?

400
00:32:15,422 --> 00:32:17,754
Just perceptive, I guess.

401
00:32:18,526 --> 00:32:20,653
Found my mother's diary.

402
00:32:21,195 --> 00:32:25,131
Discovered that a lot of the things
that I've been feeling, she felt too.

403
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:26,557
That's great.

404
00:32:29,203 --> 00:32:31,068
Isn't it?

405
00:32:31,705 --> 00:32:35,232
It's great and it's frustrating
and it's scary.

406
00:32:35,576 --> 00:32:38,010
Like she could see right through me.

407
00:32:38,813 --> 00:32:40,405
Do you ever feel like that?

408
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:43,247
More than you know.

409
00:32:45,786 --> 00:32:50,621
When I was reading her words,
it was like she was talking to me.

410
00:32:51,158 --> 00:32:53,251
And then she was gone.

411
00:32:54,395 --> 00:32:57,523
Well, you're lucky.
You're lucky you got at least that.

412
00:32:58,432 --> 00:33:02,869
Have you ever tried to find your parents?
Your biological parents, I mean?

413
00:33:03,037 --> 00:33:07,474
Not really. I figure they're a million years
away from my life now.

414
00:33:08,342 --> 00:33:11,402
If you could ask them a question,
what would you ask?

415
00:33:13,647 --> 00:33:17,481
What happened?
Why'd they let me go?

416
00:33:18,118 --> 00:33:22,680
How do I make sense
of all the strangeness in my life?

417
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:28,655
I guess neither of us
will ever get a straight answer.

418
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:36,469
I hope you find what you're looking for.

419
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:43,674
I thought you were working on a project.

420
00:33:43,844 --> 00:33:48,679
I finished early. I thought I'd spend some
time with the best boyfriend in the world.

421
00:33:48,849 --> 00:33:51,443
I'd love to, but I've got
that trig test tomorrow.

422
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:53,587
Right. I forgot.

423
00:33:53,754 --> 00:33:57,155
That's okay.
We've got the rest of our lives.

424
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,487
What's gotten into you?

425
00:34:01,662 --> 00:34:02,993
It's the new me.

426
00:34:03,163 --> 00:34:04,152
You like?

427
00:34:04,331 --> 00:34:08,495
I definitely could get used to it.
Do you need a ride home?

428
00:34:08,669 --> 00:34:10,136
I'm covered.

429
00:34:10,771 --> 00:34:12,966
Can I borrow your jacket?
It's a little cold.

430
00:34:13,407 --> 00:34:15,500
Yeah, sure.

431
00:34:16,777 --> 00:34:18,677
I'll see you tomorrow.

432
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,660
So Tina Greer can bend her bones like a
contortionist and become anyone she wants?

433
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,297
I saw it with my own eyes.

434
00:34:38,465 --> 00:34:40,797
I'm sorry.
This is usually Chloe's territory.

435
00:34:40,968 --> 00:34:43,300
I cover girls, football
and general guy stuff.

436
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:46,462
She does the tales of the unexplained.
Why not give her a call?

437
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,699
I did. She said she's busy
with something else.

438
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:51,470
<i>That's like getting turned down
by The National Enquirer.</i>

439
00:34:51,645 --> 00:34:52,669
Why are we friends?

440
00:34:53,013 --> 00:34:55,948
Because even when I think you're whacked,
I show up ready to rumble.

441
00:34:56,116 --> 00:34:57,674
Great, it's closed.

442
00:35:05,225 --> 00:35:07,785
<i>Clark, man,
haven't you ever watched Cops?</i>

443
00:35:07,962 --> 00:35:10,863
The last place Tina will hide out
is in her mom's store.

444
00:35:21,575 --> 00:35:23,440
Earth to Clark.

445
00:35:25,846 --> 00:35:28,110
-Is everything okay?
-We need to get in here.

446
00:35:28,282 --> 00:35:31,774
-Why?
-Just-- It's a hunch.

447
00:35:36,557 --> 00:35:38,582
Hey, Clark, what are we looking for?

448
00:35:45,766 --> 00:35:48,326
-Who's that?
-It's Tina's mom.

449
00:35:48,502 --> 00:35:50,902
Damn. How'd you know she was in there?

450
00:35:51,071 --> 00:35:54,905
-Because I can see right through the door.
-Very funny, Sherlock.

451
00:35:55,075 --> 00:35:57,566
-How do you think she died?
-Broken neck.

452
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:02,605
I'm guessing.

453
00:36:03,384 --> 00:36:05,750
My call, Tina's already
on a bus to Metropolis.

454
00:36:09,156 --> 00:36:10,851
I don't think so.

455
00:36:15,996 --> 00:36:17,588
Why's she writing Lana's signature?

456
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:20,256
You said Tina was obsessed with her.

457
00:36:20,434 --> 00:36:24,165
-She's gonna take it to the next level.
-She wants to kill Lana?

458
00:36:24,338 --> 00:36:26,568
Worse. She wants to become Lana.

459
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:35,479
Found your journal, Mom.
The one you kept in high school?

460
00:36:36,283 --> 00:36:40,185
Suddenly all these conversations
don't seem so one-sided.

461
00:36:41,255 --> 00:36:45,453
Tried to find your graduation speech,
but they didn't print it.

462
00:36:45,626 --> 00:36:50,120
Every time I get closer to you,
something pulls me away.

463
00:36:51,331 --> 00:36:52,889
Lana.

464
00:36:53,434 --> 00:36:56,801
-Whitney, what are you doing here?
-Your aunt said you went riding.

465
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,403
I just followed the path.

466
00:36:58,872 --> 00:37:01,102
Just talking to my parents.

467
00:37:01,442 --> 00:37:03,273
They're dead, Lana.

468
00:37:04,645 --> 00:37:07,375
You have this great life,
and you can't even see it.

469
00:37:07,548 --> 00:37:10,881
You have no right to be unhappy.

470
00:37:11,151 --> 00:37:14,985
They're not coming back, Lana.
Deal with it.

471
00:37:15,155 --> 00:37:16,850
What are you saying?

472
00:37:18,225 --> 00:37:20,819
I'm saying
you don't deserve your life.

473
00:37:24,731 --> 00:37:25,720
I do.

474
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:09,732
What are you doing here?

475
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,310
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

476
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,447
-Where's Lana?
-I don't know.

477
00:38:16,817 --> 00:38:20,309
Nell said she came out here,
but I can't find her.

478
00:38:24,391 --> 00:38:26,018
What's the matter, Clark?

479
00:38:26,193 --> 00:38:27,455
Not feeling well?

480
00:38:34,434 --> 00:38:37,562
-Tina, where's Lana?
-Tina doesn't exist anymore!

481
00:38:44,344 --> 00:38:47,108
I know what it's like to live with a secret.

482
00:38:47,981 --> 00:38:50,074
I know what happened to your mother.

483
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,842
That was a lifetime ago.

484
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:55,318
And don't worry about Lana.
You'll be joining her very soon.

485
00:38:59,593 --> 00:39:03,996
I thought I killed you once.
I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.

486
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:08,430
Where's Lana?

487
00:39:15,275 --> 00:39:16,367
Who are you?

488
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:21,970
Where is she?

489
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,540
She's dead.

490
00:39:42,436 --> 00:39:44,336
Lana!

491
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,924
Hey, I heard what happened.

492
00:40:39,092 --> 00:40:41,151
Did you come by to see if I was okay?

493
00:40:41,328 --> 00:40:44,126
As concerned as I always am
about your personal well-being...

494
00:40:44,298 --> 00:40:46,266
...I'm not here to see you.

495
00:40:48,835 --> 00:40:50,029
I did some digging.

496
00:40:55,142 --> 00:40:56,507
How did you find this?

497
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,637
If I told you, I'd have to kill you...

498
00:40:58,812 --> 00:41:01,645
...and it looks like you've had
enough trauma for one night.

499
00:41:02,249 --> 00:41:05,241
-Chloe, thank you.
-No problem.

500
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,714
-How's Tina?
-She won't be able to hurt anyone else.

501
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:12,120
I don't understand
why a girl would do all that.

502
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:13,824
I do.

503
00:41:13,994 --> 00:41:17,327
You go through life
with a gift you have to keep a secret.

504
00:41:17,497 --> 00:41:20,933
When you see everyone around you
being normal, you get jealous.

505
00:41:21,101 --> 00:41:22,591
You just wanna be somebody else.

506
00:41:37,517 --> 00:41:39,849
You really like her, don't you?

507
00:42:12,352 --> 00:42:14,616
Mom, if you could see anything,
what would you do?

508
00:42:15,522 --> 00:42:17,490
Learn to close my eyes.

509
00:42:42,649 --> 00:42:46,551
<i>As principal of Smallville High,
I would like to introduce...</i>

510
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,851
<i>...the valedictorian of the class of 1977,
Miss Laura Potter.</i>

511
00:42:56,763 --> 00:43:00,893
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
graduating seniors, good evening.</i>

512
00:43:01,067 --> 00:43:05,504
<i>Those familiar words open every
graduation address at Smallville High...</i>

513
00:43:05,672 --> 00:43:10,974
<i>...and I use them deliberately, because the
rest of my speech will not be so reassuring.</i>

514
00:43:11,144 --> 00:43:15,808
<i>I never made a difference here,
but maybe my children can.</i>

515
00:43:16,049 --> 00:43:19,348
<i>When I first came to Smallville High,
I was full of hope.</i>

516
00:43:19,686 --> 00:43:22,883
<i>I thought the world was gonna be....</i>

517
00:44:18,545 --> 00:44:19,534
