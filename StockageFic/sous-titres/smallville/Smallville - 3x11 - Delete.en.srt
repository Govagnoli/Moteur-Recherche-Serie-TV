1
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,359
Not even a goodbye?

2
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:51,728
Come on in.

3
00:00:55,971 --> 00:00:59,498
Blacklisted before I even graduate.
That's got to be a record.

4
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:02,537
I don't know who you ticked off
around here...

5
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:04,508
...but you sure ruffled some feathers.

6
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:07,977
I have enemies in high places.

7
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:11,310
Well, we're gonna miss you.

8
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:14,479
Yeah, right. You're just gonna miss
the free proofreader.

9
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:17,386
Max, your wife's called
three times about dinner.

10
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,627
Tell her I'm on my way.

11
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:25,390
-lf there's anything I can ever do--
-Actually....

12
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:28,931
A few stories I've been working on.
I'd love for you to look at them.

13
00:01:29,238 --> 00:01:32,696
I couldn't print your name
in the classifieds without catching hell.

14
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:35,666
Well, what about a pseudonym?

15
00:01:36,578 --> 00:01:39,240
She's my cousin.
She won't mind at all.

16
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:41,508
She's not interested in journalism.

17
00:01:44,586 --> 00:01:46,076
Lois Lane.

18
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:20,350
I was looking for the on-call tech guy.

19
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:22,254
Well, you found her.

20
00:02:22,658 --> 00:02:24,649
You work in the tech department?

21
00:02:25,027 --> 00:02:28,724
You'd rather have a PlayStation-addicted
dork wearing a Star Wars T-shirt?

22
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:34,601
-Molly.
-Lex.

23
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:38,165
So, what's the crisis, Lex?

24
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,835
Well, I'm trying to finish a presentation,
my program keeps crashing, and...

25
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:46,207
...I don't have time to deal with it.

26
00:02:46,782 --> 00:02:48,511
Probably a virus.

27
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:50,208
I would assume so.

28
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,866
I've only been back a few weeks,
but I'm surprised I haven't seen you.

29
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:11,236
Back from where?

30
00:03:12,074 --> 00:03:15,840
-It's a long story.
-l.e., none of my business.

31
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:19,977
There we go.

32
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:24,986
This should scan for any viruses.

33
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:29,086
Are you a do-it-yourselfer,
or do you need me to do it for you?

34
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:34,156
I think I can handle it.

35
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:32,048
Welcome to the Torch...
unplugged.

36
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:34,051
What happened to my computers?

37
00:04:34,556 --> 00:04:36,786
Bunch of deliverymen
stopped by this afternoon.

38
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,950
LuthorCorp took the computers back.

39
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:41,588
But they were donated.

40
00:04:41,763 --> 00:04:44,823
Yeah, well,
I guess the Grinch changed his mind.

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,060
Oh, yeah, some girl stopped by.
Didn't leave a name.

42
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:50,928
Thanks, Pete.

43
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:05,606
Chloe?

44
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:12,145
Last thing I remember, I was in the library
working on my history paper.

45
00:07:12,314 --> 00:07:13,872
Stone sober.

46
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:16,677
Miss Sullivan, would you care
to shed any light...

47
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:19,480
...on Mr. Kent's version of the incident?

48
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:22,885
What do you mean,
the part where I wasn't eating pavement?

49
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:26,026
I don't know.

50
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:33,190
It just....
It looked like he lost control of his truck.

51
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:41,005
Well, Mr. Kent, your family sure has its way
of going through vehicles.

52
00:07:42,577 --> 00:07:45,171
-Chloe?
-ls that all you need from Clark?

53
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,511
Why don't you go on home.

54
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:54,212
I got a few more questions
for our Miss Sullivan.

55
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:14,537
Well, I'm glad you're feeling better, Adam.

56
00:08:19,514 --> 00:08:22,347
Clark, are you okay?
I just heard about the accident.

57
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:25,748
I'm okay, but Chloe's a little scraped up.

58
00:08:30,392 --> 00:08:32,053
Clark, this is Adam.

59
00:08:33,094 --> 00:08:35,028
Nice to finally meet you.

60
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:39,525
So you're Clark. Heard a lot about you.

61
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:42,261
Didn't realize there was that much to say.

62
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:47,303
-How'd you get here so quickly?
-I was just visiting Adam.

63
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:49,602
-Physical therapy.
-That's where you met?

64
00:08:50,111 --> 00:08:52,875
Yeah, I thought I'd see you
when you visited Lana, but...

65
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:56,283
...I guess you got busy.

66
00:08:57,352 --> 00:09:00,082
Looks like we've all been busy.

67
00:09:06,795 --> 00:09:11,459
Since Lex gave me this thing, it's like no
one can change a coffee filter on their own.

68
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,277
Mr. Luthor.

69
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:33,012
-Where's Molly?
-Molly?

70
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:35,713
She was working here last night.
She loaned me this.

71
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:37,950
I've been looking for that.

72
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:39,821
We don't have a Molly.

73
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:42,987
I was the one on call last night.
From home.

74
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:46,099
She was here unpacking
these computer boxes.

75
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:52,935
Huh. Well, that might explain
how all those hard drives got wiped out.

76
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:07,085
There is a lot going on in that cup.

77
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:08,722
It's your first time here...

78
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,654
...and I'm trying really hard
to get the thumbs-up.

79
00:10:13,528 --> 00:10:16,224
This place has really been a refuge for me.

80
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:17,797
Refuge from what?

81
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,827
Oh, just everything.

82
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:22,469
It was interesting meeting Clark.

83
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:27,770
We're just friends.

84
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:30,172
Just friends?

85
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:34,109
For friends, you're very
uncomfortable around each other.

86
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,516
Yeah, well, we've got a lot of history.

87
00:10:38,186 --> 00:10:40,746
I saw the way he looked at you.

88
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:46,289
Clark doesn't know what he wants.

89
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:50,490
Besides, I can't control the way he feels.

90
00:10:53,535 --> 00:10:55,730
And...you?

91
00:10:57,372 --> 00:11:01,866
Clark will always be
a very important part of my life...

92
00:11:02,644 --> 00:11:06,410
...but whatever there was between us,
it's gone.

93
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:27,933
If you're looking for signs of tampering,
I'll save you some time.

94
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:30,833
There's nothing wrong with it.
I asked the mechanic.

95
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:33,099
There's gotta be some explanation.

96
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:36,636
As to why you tried to mow me over?

97
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:40,376
I'm ready and waiting.

98
00:11:40,682 --> 00:11:42,877
Didn't you tell the sheriff I lost control?

99
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:46,884
I was covering for you, Clark.
You chased me onto the sidewalk.

100
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:51,354
I know you're still upset
about the whole Lionel thing...

101
00:11:51,526 --> 00:11:54,893
...but don't you think manslaughter
is beyond "eye for an eye"?

102
00:11:55,296 --> 00:11:57,230
You don't think I tried to hurt you?

103
00:11:57,432 --> 00:12:01,562
I don't know,
but the way you've been acting lately....

104
00:12:01,736 --> 00:12:05,331
I don't know, Clark.
I can only apologize so many times.

105
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:10,035
I have been having a hard time
getting over this.

106
00:12:10,445 --> 00:12:13,642
Every time I see you, I can't help
picturing you and Lionel talking.

107
00:12:16,284 --> 00:12:17,979
You're not the same person you were.

108
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:21,580
Like if I moved to Metropolis,
became a biker party animal...

109
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:25,089
...and told you to get out of my life.
Like that, right?

110
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,730
Look, you know what?

111
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:33,161
As much fun as this guilt trip is...

112
00:12:33,334 --> 00:12:37,430
...I came here to see if you put any more
pieces together from last night.

113
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:41,741
What happened after the library?

114
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:45,980
I don't even remember leaving the library.

115
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:49,605
The last thing I do remember,
I was working on my laptop.

116
00:13:06,768 --> 00:13:09,532
Well, the computer recovered your paper.

117
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:13,638
That's an interesting take
on General Sherman.

118
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:19,142
I didn't even finish my sentence.

119
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:27,814
It says I downloaded an e-mail
before the accident, but it won't open.

120
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:32,655
Who's Brainwave?

121
00:14:03,892 --> 00:14:07,225
Remind me again
what your school mascot is.

122
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:10,223
Wait, it's a bird.

123
00:14:11,232 --> 00:14:15,794
Okay, it's a small town.
We take our school spirit very seriously.

124
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,335
I forgot my history book.

125
00:14:17,505 --> 00:14:19,803
-Meet you outside?
-Okay.

126
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:18,961
Lana. I've been looking for you.

127
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:31,371
-Lana, what are you doing?
-Killing Chloe Sullivan.

128
00:16:49,624 --> 00:16:51,023
What happened?

129
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:03,395
We can rule out paranoia.
Someone is trying to kill me.

130
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:05,232
Not just someone.

131
00:17:05,406 --> 00:17:07,874
Either way,
it still doesn't look great for me.

132
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:09,873
Chloe, I'm so sorry.

133
00:17:10,044 --> 00:17:12,877
-I can't believe I went after you like that.
-Yeah.

134
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:17,077
I can't believe you got us suspended.

135
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:19,242
Thankfully, Adam was there.

136
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,651
Those were some really nice moves.
Was that, kung fu, judo?

137
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:25,387
I don't know.

138
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:29,496
I guess I watched a few
too many Jackie Chan movies.

139
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:34,164
Who'd have thought it'd come in handy
in the halls of Smallville High?

140
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:39,065
Just before this,
did you get any weird e-mails?

141
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,730
Let me check.

142
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:44,111
I did, but I don't remember opening it.

143
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:50,682
The same thing happened to both of us.
It's like we were hypnotized.

144
00:17:51,252 --> 00:17:52,617
A subliminal message?

145
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:55,415
Maybe something hidden
in the binary codes.

146
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,251
Well, how did I snap out of it?

147
00:17:57,425 --> 00:18:02,089
I'm more concerned with what triggered
the "Kill Chloe" impulse in the first place.

148
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,792
It's Brainwave again.

149
00:18:12,206 --> 00:18:17,166
Every computer online has an lP address.
We should be able to track the message...

150
00:18:17,345 --> 00:18:19,779
...to the computer that it was sent from.

151
00:18:19,947 --> 00:18:21,505
You can do that?

152
00:18:21,682 --> 00:18:23,809
We'll see.

153
00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:26,010
If this Brainwave person
wanted me dead...

154
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:30,089
...why didn't they just send me
a message saying to off myself?

155
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:32,317
The brain's hardwired to stay alive.

156
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:36,122
Not even hypnotic messages
can override our survival instincts.

157
00:18:36,397 --> 00:18:38,831
What, did you just pick that up somewhere?

158
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:41,834
I was in physical rehab for months.

159
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:44,494
What else is there to do but read?

160
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,772
Chloe, the message came
from your computer.

161
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,544
I thought Lionel took back
all of your computers.

162
00:18:58,986 --> 00:19:02,581
Why would anyone at LuthorCorp
want to attack you?

163
00:19:05,026 --> 00:19:07,290
I hate to think
you wasted a trip here...

164
00:19:07,462 --> 00:19:10,124
...but I doubt my father's
trying to kill Chloe.

165
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:13,927
Why? He was willing to put
his own son in a mental institution.

166
00:19:14,602 --> 00:19:16,661
You know what he's capable of.

167
00:19:16,838 --> 00:19:21,571
Clark, what reason would he have to go
after a high school reporter from Smallville?

168
00:19:23,211 --> 00:19:25,679
Is there something you're not telling me?

169
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,713
Does this have to do with
the seven weeks I can't remember?

170
00:19:29,884 --> 00:19:32,819
All I know is that Lionel asked you
to fire Chloe's dad.

171
00:19:32,987 --> 00:19:35,080
Look, Clark, that was business.

172
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,190
Contrary to common perception...

173
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:41,692
...my father isn't behind
every nefarious activity in Smallville...

174
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:43,964
...and he'd never be that circuitous.

175
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:49,233
Those e-mails came from Chloe's computer
after it was shipped to LuthorCorp.

176
00:19:50,137 --> 00:19:51,900
Who else would have access?

177
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:02,638
Dr. Garner.
How are things at Summerholt?

178
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:04,409
Is everything okay?

179
00:20:04,585 --> 00:20:06,280
No.

180
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:09,222
I wish I could say it was.

181
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,726
A reporter from the Daily Planet
stopped by today.

182
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:16,890
His name was Max Taylor.

183
00:20:17,331 --> 00:20:20,198
About that horrible article that girl wrote?

184
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:22,932
Unfortunately.

185
00:20:23,838 --> 00:20:27,035
I just don't know what I'm going to do
if they shut me down.

186
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:30,337
Think about all the people that I've helped.

187
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:33,242
Where will they go?

188
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:36,409
That's never going to happen.

189
00:20:36,584 --> 00:20:38,347
I don't know.

190
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:41,848
I just can't seem to get them
to leave us alone.

191
00:20:42,924 --> 00:20:44,755
How can I make them understand?

192
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:47,227
You can't.

193
00:20:47,395 --> 00:20:49,590
They'll never understand.

194
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:53,632
I'm just glad
I was able to help you so much.

195
00:20:57,705 --> 00:21:00,572
But if these reporters have their way...

196
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:04,672
...other patients may not be so lucky.

197
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,286
Are you leaving?

198
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:23,462
Paroled. Good behavior.

199
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:28,859
So are you heading back to Metropolis?

200
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,467
Well, I was...sort of thinking about...

201
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,505
...staying in Smallville.

202
00:21:36,577 --> 00:21:38,272
Why?

203
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:43,907
-That hurt.
-No. I just meant, you know...

204
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:47,054
...after what I did at the school....

205
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:51,852
Smallville doesn't seem like the type
of place you'd go to if you could...

206
00:21:52,026 --> 00:21:53,960
...go anywhere.

207
00:21:54,228 --> 00:21:56,822
Actually, it's about
as close to a home as I have.

208
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:04,197
I was hoping I could spend more time
with a certain coffee shop owner who...

209
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:08,331
...just happens to have
the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.

210
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:14,715
Adam, we don't really know each other.

211
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:19,384
Wasn't that the point of me staying?

212
00:22:21,322 --> 00:22:23,449
What's the problem?

213
00:22:31,098 --> 00:22:36,627
No one knows martial arts
without remembering where they learned it.

214
00:22:37,204 --> 00:22:39,468
Chloe can't hack a computer
like you can...

215
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,872
...and if you got it all from reading,
then where are the books?

216
00:22:47,715 --> 00:22:50,980
Clark must've really
messed with your head.

217
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,944
Yeah, he did.

218
00:22:56,957 --> 00:23:01,223
-And I won't let that happen again.
-Look, Lana, I like you...

219
00:23:01,395 --> 00:23:03,363
...and I've told you that.

220
00:23:04,699 --> 00:23:08,658
Whatever your problems are, I'm not
gonna stick around to be one of them.

221
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:16,175
I think you should go.

222
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:50,070
Chloe.

223
00:23:50,478 --> 00:23:52,639
Clark, don't sneak up on me like that.

224
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,815
Lex told me they found
your old computer at LuthorCorp.

225
00:23:55,983 --> 00:23:58,474
But the hard drive is gone.

226
00:23:58,652 --> 00:24:03,487
-lncluding all of my e-mail addresses.
-He thinks this is who took it.

227
00:24:03,657 --> 00:24:05,887
She may work for Lionel.
Her name's Molly--

228
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,757
Griggs. Yeah, I know,
and for once, the connection isn't Lionel.

229
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,660
I interviewed her for a story I did
a month ago.

230
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,095
About what?

231
00:24:14,268 --> 00:24:16,600
Summerholt Neurological lnstitute.

232
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:18,762
Summerholt?

233
00:24:18,939 --> 00:24:20,770
Isn't that where Ryan used to be?

234
00:24:21,075 --> 00:24:24,306
Yeah, to study his ESP.
That's why I looked into the place.

235
00:24:24,478 --> 00:24:27,914
He isn't the only patient
held against their will.

236
00:24:28,082 --> 00:24:30,983
His methods
are right out of the Mengele handbook.

237
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:34,121
-Why was Molly there?
-MlT recruited her at 1 5.

238
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:38,520
She was a total engineer whiz kid until
she went homicidal on another student.

239
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:40,717
After her breakdown,
she went to Summerholt.

240
00:24:40,928 --> 00:24:45,126
-But Summerholt isn't a psych ward.
-For megalo-brainiacs, it is.

241
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:49,168
Why would she want to kill you?

242
00:24:49,336 --> 00:24:53,432
When I talked to her, she was adamant
that Dr. Garner had given her a new life.

243
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:56,936
I had enough in that article
to shut him down in a second.

244
00:24:57,478 --> 00:24:59,571
Who else knows about this article?

245
00:25:01,248 --> 00:25:02,545
Max.

246
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:07,050
Chloe, I've seen your Summerholt story.
I think you've got something here.

247
00:25:09,123 --> 00:25:11,421
Slow down.
Threats are a part of the job...

248
00:25:11,592 --> 00:25:13,822
...but I appreciate the heads up.

249
00:25:17,231 --> 00:25:19,290
You'll get used to it.

250
00:25:22,837 --> 00:25:25,032
You need something, Maureen?

251
00:25:29,844 --> 00:25:31,209
Max?

252
00:25:35,616 --> 00:25:37,208
Max?

253
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:39,716
Max?

254
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,253
Max! No!

255
00:25:46,227 --> 00:25:47,956
Max!

256
00:25:54,535 --> 00:25:57,231
Thanks for letting Chloe stay here, Lex.

257
00:25:58,072 --> 00:26:00,267
Whatever I can do to help.

258
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:03,309
This is the last place
anybody would look for me.

259
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:09,043
Chloe, I'm sorry about what happened
to your friend at the Daily Planet.

260
00:26:11,518 --> 00:26:13,577
You must've had Garner over a barrel.

261
00:26:15,556 --> 00:26:19,549
I obviously didn't know
what I was getting myself into.

262
00:26:20,828 --> 00:26:23,592
It just seems to be a nasty habit
I've picked up lately.

263
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:27,129
So your theory is that...

264
00:26:27,301 --> 00:26:31,169
...Garner has turned Molly
into his own e-mail assassin...

265
00:26:31,338 --> 00:26:32,896
...using hypnotic suggestion?

266
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:35,098
It's not that far of a stretch.

267
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:38,245
Summerholt goes from studying the brain
to controlling it.

268
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:43,214
A pretty amazing breakthrough,
despite the application.

269
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:47,787
There's no question. When it comes to
brain-warping, Garner's definitely the guy.

270
00:26:48,989 --> 00:26:51,321
-I'm gonna go talk to Garner.
-Clark, don't.

271
00:26:51,492 --> 00:26:54,017
-It's too dangerous.
-I'm not the one he's looking for.

272
00:26:54,194 --> 00:26:56,594
It'll be all right.
Just don't leave the mansion.

273
00:26:56,764 --> 00:26:59,289
I'll call you if I find anything.

274
00:27:01,335 --> 00:27:04,736
Chloe, I have my tech guys
trying to track her.

275
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:06,964
I'm gonna go see what they've got.

276
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:09,302
Make yourself at home.

277
00:27:34,668 --> 00:27:36,135
Clark Kent.

278
00:27:36,303 --> 00:27:38,703
You here to abduct
another one of my patients?

279
00:27:39,773 --> 00:27:43,106
I think you'll find security's
increased since your last visit.

280
00:27:43,277 --> 00:27:47,441
-I know what you and Molly are doing.
-Molly.... Griggs?

281
00:27:47,614 --> 00:27:49,343
She left us months ago.

282
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,381
She's sending out hypnotic e-mails.

283
00:27:51,552 --> 00:27:54,146
Not the kind of technology
you get at RadioShack.

284
00:27:54,355 --> 00:27:57,290
Nor Summerholt,
if that's what you're implying.

285
00:27:58,525 --> 00:28:02,461
Molly already killed one reporter who was
about to expose what you're doing here...

286
00:28:02,629 --> 00:28:05,689
...and she's going after another.
It's quite a coincidence.

287
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,668
Mr. Kent, this is a serious
research institute.

288
00:28:10,838 --> 00:28:15,366
I'm not going to involve Summerholt in
some imaginary high school investigation.

289
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:18,371
I don't think the police
are gonna see it that way.

290
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,109
Dr. Garner?

291
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:25,516
Cornell, could you show our friend
to the door?

292
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:54,712
Centennial Tower Apartments.
How may I direct your call?

293
00:28:58,218 --> 00:29:00,277
Apartment 927, please.

294
00:29:01,922 --> 00:29:03,287
Hello?

295
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,219
Molly, something else has come up.

296
00:29:15,235 --> 00:29:17,362
Library.

297
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:21,674
That's where you'll find
all the books I was reading.

298
00:29:22,976 --> 00:29:25,171
I thought you'd be
on your way to Metropolis.

299
00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:28,439
I was, but I didn't want to
leave things the way we did.

300
00:29:28,882 --> 00:29:31,009
I can be a little abrupt.

301
00:29:31,185 --> 00:29:33,244
That's one way of putting it.

302
00:29:34,455 --> 00:29:36,548
You are driving me nuts!

303
00:29:36,723 --> 00:29:39,920
I can see how strong you are,
then for some stupid reason...

304
00:29:40,094 --> 00:29:44,053
...you retreat into this hurt-little-girl facade.
It's ridiculous.

305
00:29:44,665 --> 00:29:47,065
This is your way of ending things
on better terms?

306
00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:50,397
People here don't say what they think.

307
00:29:51,138 --> 00:29:53,402
I wasn't trying to hide anything from you.

308
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:57,608
-Then why are you so guarded?
-You have to understand.

309
00:29:57,811 --> 00:30:02,441
There are patches of my life
that I just can't piece back together.

310
00:30:02,883 --> 00:30:06,910
And everyone that could answer
those questions is gone.

311
00:30:08,288 --> 00:30:10,313
It's kind of scary.

312
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:18,961
Smallville just seemed a little less terrifying
than going to Metropolis on my own.

313
00:30:25,572 --> 00:30:27,699
Crazy ninja girls and all?

314
00:30:30,777 --> 00:30:33,803
Crazy ninja girls and all.

315
00:30:36,683 --> 00:30:40,619
I guess I just was moving a little too fast,
so I'm sorry...

316
00:30:40,787 --> 00:30:44,188
...if I read something
in our friendship that wasn't there.

317
00:30:45,225 --> 00:30:48,661
I think it was a little too early
to tell what was there.

318
00:30:51,198 --> 00:30:52,825
Yeah.

319
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:58,969
I'm gonna miss my bus.

320
00:31:09,483 --> 00:31:11,678
Lana, l....

321
00:31:11,985 --> 00:31:15,148
I really hope
you find a way to trust people again.

322
00:31:17,891 --> 00:31:21,156
Because you're a really amazing person,
and...

323
00:31:21,328 --> 00:31:24,525
...it'd be a shame not to let someone
get close enough to see that.

324
00:31:33,707 --> 00:31:35,106
Adam, wait.

325
00:31:40,314 --> 00:31:42,680
Were you serious about staying?

326
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:01,933
I'm starting to get a complex.

327
00:32:02,102 --> 00:32:06,471
Seems all the women I find even remotely
appealing turn out to be psychopaths.

328
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,105
Birds of a feather.

329
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:16,613
What did Garner do to you?

330
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:29,425
Lex, what are you doing here?

331
00:32:29,963 --> 00:32:32,090
My tech guy traced her.

332
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,499
And you would be...?

333
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:40,764
This is what you're using
to hurt my friends?

334
00:32:40,941 --> 00:32:42,135
Get away from that.

335
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:45,107
Don't protect Garner.
We know he's controlling you.

336
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,079
There's only one person with that ability.
Me. Get away from the computer!

337
00:32:49,249 --> 00:32:50,682
Looking for this, Clark?

338
00:32:52,286 --> 00:32:53,913
How'd you get that?

339
00:32:55,422 --> 00:32:57,117
Birds of a feather.

340
00:33:01,495 --> 00:33:03,588
It wasn't Garner.

341
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:06,289
You're the one
who developed the program, huh?

342
00:33:08,502 --> 00:33:10,402
I pulled it from your disk drive.

343
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,538
You don't understand.

344
00:33:13,974 --> 00:33:16,670
You don't know what it's like
to be so different...

345
00:33:16,843 --> 00:33:18,936
...to see things other kids can't see...

346
00:33:19,112 --> 00:33:22,479
...to feel and to think about things
they can't even imagine.

347
00:33:25,686 --> 00:33:28,018
Molly, Garner's not helping you.

348
00:33:28,188 --> 00:33:32,318
He made me feel normal,
and I never thought that could happen.

349
00:33:37,531 --> 00:33:41,126
Now, if someone gave you that chance,
wouldn't you protect them too?

350
00:33:44,838 --> 00:33:47,671
Clark, she sent an e-mail
right before we got here.

351
00:33:47,974 --> 00:33:50,465
You recognize the address?

352
00:33:54,481 --> 00:33:56,210
Mom.

353
00:33:57,551 --> 00:33:58,984
Mrs. Kent?

354
00:34:00,787 --> 00:34:02,687
Mrs. Kent, I got your call.

355
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:06,816
What did Clark find out?

356
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:39,448
Chloe.

357
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:42,524
Are you all right?

358
00:34:48,702 --> 00:34:49,964
Clark!

359
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,201
Mom.

360
00:35:28,008 --> 00:35:29,839
What happened?

361
00:35:31,178 --> 00:35:33,146
Are you okay?

362
00:35:57,204 --> 00:35:59,604
Okay, just keep an open mind.

363
00:36:08,415 --> 00:36:11,384
So? What do you think?

364
00:36:11,551 --> 00:36:12,813
I think...

365
00:36:12,986 --> 00:36:16,547
...Norman Bates
would be right at home here.

366
00:36:16,723 --> 00:36:19,988
Not exactly the tenant I had in mind.

367
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,391
Is that an offer?

368
00:36:22,562 --> 00:36:26,896
If we clear out all this junk and paint,
it could be a really cool space.

369
00:36:27,067 --> 00:36:30,559
I negotiated a good deal
on the rent with the owner.

370
00:36:32,205 --> 00:36:35,697
Well, I guess an upside would be
I wouldn't need an alarm clock.

371
00:36:37,611 --> 00:36:39,875
The smell of fresh coffee
would wake me up.

372
00:36:40,046 --> 00:36:42,344
Yeah, unless you're making it.

373
00:36:42,516 --> 00:36:45,747
If you stick around long enough,
I might just put you to work.

374
00:36:50,657 --> 00:36:52,522
I appreciate you doing this for me...

375
00:36:52,692 --> 00:36:55,752
...but I don't want you to do it
because you feel sorry for me.

376
00:36:56,062 --> 00:36:58,963
No. No, that's not what this is about.

377
00:36:59,132 --> 00:37:00,599
Trust me.

378
00:37:03,937 --> 00:37:06,167
I'm just trying to help out a friend.

379
00:37:19,386 --> 00:37:20,876
New computers?

380
00:37:21,054 --> 00:37:23,579
The same old computers. New Luthor.

381
00:37:23,757 --> 00:37:26,692
Lex returned them to me,
no strings attached.

382
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:30,352
I guess he felt guilty about firing my dad.

383
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,191
At least you're up and running.

384
00:37:32,899 --> 00:37:36,357
-Sans cyber stalker.
-Your soul is still intact.

385
00:37:36,603 --> 00:37:38,230
Yeah.

386
00:37:40,974 --> 00:37:43,670
You know, with all this stuff with Molly...

387
00:37:43,843 --> 00:37:47,040
...there's a part of me
that feels like maybe I deserved it.

388
00:37:47,414 --> 00:37:49,609
-Now, Chloe--
-No, like it was my penance.

389
00:37:49,783 --> 00:37:51,910
For what I did to you.

390
00:37:54,754 --> 00:37:57,120
You can't take all the blame.

391
00:37:59,192 --> 00:38:02,127
You went to Lionel
because I pushed you away.

392
00:38:02,295 --> 00:38:04,559
Seems to be
one of my hidden talents lately.

393
00:38:05,231 --> 00:38:07,165
It's not so hidden.

394
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:13,862
You know, I never set out
to investigate you, Clark.

395
00:38:14,374 --> 00:38:16,137
It just....

396
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:21,309
It was so flattering that someone like that
would be interested in my work.

397
00:38:22,215 --> 00:38:25,776
-lt made you feel like you mattered.
-Yeah.

398
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:30,212
And then Lionel, like, set my dream out
right in front of me, and I just....

399
00:38:30,924 --> 00:38:34,985
I don't know.
I gave in to all my worst instincts.

400
00:38:35,161 --> 00:38:38,619
Chloe, he caught you at a weak moment,
and we all have them.

401
00:38:39,366 --> 00:38:42,028
When you found me at mine in Metropolis...

402
00:38:42,569 --> 00:38:45,094
...you didn't turn your back on me.

403
00:38:45,271 --> 00:38:49,332
You gave me a second chance,
and I at least owe you the same.

404
00:38:50,176 --> 00:38:52,371
I'd like that.

405
00:38:55,615 --> 00:38:59,984
So, what now? I mean, we can't just forget
about everything that's happened.

406
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:08,659
Well, you have to understand, there are
some things about me that'll never add up.

407
00:39:09,729 --> 00:39:11,856
I know that.

408
00:39:14,768 --> 00:39:17,259
Are you willing to stop digging?

409
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,906
Yeah. I mean, I figure you'll just...

410
00:39:23,076 --> 00:39:25,237
...tell me when you think it's right.

411
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:29,808
I'll see you tomorrow.

412
00:39:29,983 --> 00:39:31,245
Okay.

413
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,471
Mr. Luthor.

414
00:39:58,945 --> 00:40:03,507
I should've known when Clark stopped by
that you wouldn't be far behind.

415
00:40:04,017 --> 00:40:07,578
Any more attempts
on Chloe Sullivan's life would be...

416
00:40:09,222 --> 00:40:10,883
...ill-advised.

417
00:40:12,292 --> 00:40:15,625
Molly seems to have vanished into thin air.

418
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:18,763
I don't suppose you'd know
anything about that.

419
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:22,359
Molly's in the care of people
who will help her...

420
00:40:22,535 --> 00:40:24,366
...not exploit her.

421
00:40:24,938 --> 00:40:26,906
Lex, you're a smart man.

422
00:40:27,073 --> 00:40:32,010
You know that the line has to be bent
now and then in order to make progress.

423
00:40:32,712 --> 00:40:36,375
I believe there's a difference
between bent and broken.

424
00:40:38,985 --> 00:40:41,249
You've never been so close
to making a discovery...

425
00:40:41,421 --> 00:40:45,323
...that you'd be willing to do almost
anything to see it through?

426
00:40:46,392 --> 00:40:50,726
My work could change the way
the world views intelligence, thought.

427
00:40:50,897 --> 00:40:54,094
Your research isn't worth
the cost of innocent lives.

428
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:58,629
And I don't have time for a morality lesson.
Excuse me.

429
00:41:01,574 --> 00:41:04,873
Chloe's article is a real page-turner.

430
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:11,749
Almost worth killing over.

431
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,648
Wouldn't you say, doctor?

432
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:23,592
What do you want, Lex?

433
00:41:25,165 --> 00:41:26,860
Your help.

434
00:41:33,807 --> 00:41:35,399
A few months ago...

435
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:39,939
...I had an unfortunate session
of shock therapy that...

436
00:41:40,113 --> 00:41:43,514
...basically erased
seven weeks of my life.

437
00:41:48,154 --> 00:41:51,317
I want those seven weeks back.

438
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
