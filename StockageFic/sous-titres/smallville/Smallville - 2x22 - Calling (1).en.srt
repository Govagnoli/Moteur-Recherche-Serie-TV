1
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,640
Dr. Marcus.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,120
What was so urgent you
needed me here tonight?

3
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,360
It's Dr. Walden. There's been a complete
normalization of his higher brain functions.

4
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,560
Considering the source of the trauma,
nothing surprises me.

5
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,000
You mean the Kawatche caves?

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,000
How does a linguist go into a coma
deciphering a Native American language?

7
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,960
If you had that answer, doctor,
you'd be running the place.

8
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,280
The day is coming.
The day is coming. The day is coming!

9
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,320
Lana.

10
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,040
It's almost midnight.

11
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,720
Yeah, I took a chance
you'd still be up.

12
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,040
You getting a head start
on your term paper?

13
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,720
I've gotta give the toast
at Lex's rehearsal dinner.

14
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,280
Makes European history
seem like a breeze.

15
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,440
- I'm supposed to guess what's in the box?
- No.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,760
You're supposed to close your eyes.

17
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,880
Don't peek.

18
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,560
Okay.

19
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,960
I know. It's not your birthday
for another seven minutes...

20
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,160
...but I wanted to surprise you.

21
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,800
You did.

22
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,040
I get the feeling
it's not in a good way.

23
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,160
It's just, it's not really
my birthday.

24
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,960
It's just some date my parents picked off
the calendar for the adoption papers.

25
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,040
Maybe some of us want to celebrate
the day you came into our lives.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,400
I never thought of it that way.

27
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,800
Make a wish.

28
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,240
I've been wishing for the same
thing ever since I was 5.

29
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,040
And now?

30
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,800
And now I don't have to.

31
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,520
She's standing right here
in front of me.

32
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,120
- Good morning, Mom.
- How was your birthday party?

33
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,920
So you're the one who told Lana.

34
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,840
She knows we're not
big on birthdays...

35
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,320
...but wondered if she
could do something special.

36
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,200
Thanks.

37
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,280
I feel bad. We never had parties
when you were little...

38
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,120
...but we were always nervous.
- It's okay, I understand.

39
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,600
I know...

40
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,480
...but what mother denies her son a
birthday party? It's a part of childhood.

41
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,680
All the mistakes you made with me,
you can correct with the baby.

42
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,480
- Wouldn't want to scar the little one too.
- Thanks a lot.

43
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,160
So, last night?

44
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,880
- Are you prying?
- Okay, never mind.

45
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,800
- Hello. Look what the cat dragged in.
- Lex, have you had breakfast?

46
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,480
Thanks, but I can't stay.

47
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,280
I just wanted to ask you
and Mr. Kent for a favor.

48
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,960
I know we've had our differences,
so this might sound strange...

49
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,120
...but it would mean a lot to me.

50
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,520
It's customary
for the bride and groom to sit...

51
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,360
...with their parents
at the rehearsal dinner...

52
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,240
...so since mine won't be there,
I was wondering...

53
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,000
...would the two of you
consider standing in?

54
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,240
Lex, we would be honored.

55
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,000
Great. That just leaves one
open seat at the table.

56
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,000
Right next to you, Clark.

57
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,920
Any suggestions?

58
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,200
Chloe.

59
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,880
The one name you won't find
on the list...

60
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,080
...for Smallville's biggest event
of the century.

61
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,880
Don't worry,
it's not like I'm holding out...

62
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,960
...for my fairy godmother
to bring glass slippers.

63
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,160
I'm still not convinced Lex
won't have me in a headset...

64
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,120
...running around with ice buckets.

65
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,920
Is this what you were doing until
2:00 in the morning last night?

66
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,080
Yeah.

67
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,880
Well, I can't vouch
for my calligraphy skills...

68
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,560
...but if you need any help,
just let me know.

69
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,960
Hey, you guys.
I'd like a double espresso, please.

70
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,680
Were you burning
the midnight oil last night too?

71
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,680
I was just...

72
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,080
...working on a toast
for Lex's dinner.

73
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,320
Chloe, ready to go?

74
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,280
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah.

75
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,560
- Great.
- Perfect.

76
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,960
Just checking.

77
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,120
Right. Well...
We better get going.

78
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,280
I have ashes to sweep
and wicked stepsisters to undermine.

79
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,400
- You didn't...?
- No.

80
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,120
I had a really good time last night.

81
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,560
I was thinking maybe we could go out
after the rehearsal dinner tonight.

82
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,480
Maybe.

83
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,280
Lana, is everything okay?

84
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,840
If this is about last night,
we can take it slow.

85
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,400
Clark, I think last night
may have been a mistake.

86
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,080
I'm really busy.
I'll call you later?

87
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,160
Here's the revised seating chart
for the rehearsal dinner.

88
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,120
- Who are the people marked in blue?
- Relatives who still talk to each other.

89
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,520
How about the red?

90
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,880
Family feuds and people who haven't
spoken in at least five years.

91
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,080
And the yellow ones
scattered throughout?

92
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,600
Buffer zones.

93
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,840
Relatives who have no
particular allegiance...

94
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,080
...and whose conversation
won't incite a riot.

95
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,960
If this medical career doesn't work out,
you should consider the United Nations.

96
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,400
- I'm not done yet.
- By the way, put the Kents at our table.

97
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,880
I asked them to sit with us at the dinner,
fill in for my parents.

98
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,440
Lex.

99
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,680
I think it's great that you wanna
make them a big part of this, but...

100
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,880
But what?

101
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,720
Don't you think this might be the right
moment to reach out to your father?

102
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,440
Helen.

103
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,440
I'm touched that you
want us to reconcile.

104
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,040
But it's not gonna happen.

105
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,240
Besides...

106
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,080
...the only family I need is you.

107
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,400
I don't believe this.

108
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,360
We should call the police.

109
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,440
Is anything valuable missing?

110
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,880
Gosh, I'm sorry to hear that, Helen.

111
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,800
- They take anything important?
- The vial of blood I drew from Clark.

112
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Tell me why you
would even still have that.

113
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,040
I thought I might need it someday,
in case he got sick again.

114
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,040
It wasn't labeled. There's no way
anyone could connect it to Clark.

115
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,280
Then why would anybody
wanna steal it?

116
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,160
It looks like somebody just broke open the
refrigerator and took whatever was inside.

117
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,000
The police think it may have been
junkies looking for drugs.

118
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,880
Or maybe somebody who wanted
to make it look that way.

119
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,000
Are you saying you think
that I staged this?

120
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,320
We're the only ones who knew
about Clark's blood.

121
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,960
- And you never told anybody else?
- Of course not.

122
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,160
Not even the man
you're about to marry?

123
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,320
Mr. Kent...

124
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,720
Lex is not the man
you think he is.

125
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,880
Considering that you're about to spend
the rest of your life with that man...

126
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,520
...and what you know
about my family...

127
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,160
...you had better be right.

128
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,400
I don't think it's a good idea
that you seat Lana next to me.

129
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,880
What happened?

130
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,240
I wish I knew.

131
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,080
Clark.

132
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,200
None of us really
understands the fairer sex.

133
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,160
It's why we're so
captivated by them.

134
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,160
I went for it last night.

135
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,680
- Don't tell me she shot you down.
- No.

136
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,880
It was the opposite.

137
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,240
It was like this perfect moment,
and then this morning...

138
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,440
She wanted to pretend
it never happened.

139
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,280
You've upped the stakes, Clark,
and she's scared.

140
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,080
She figures if she folds now,
she'll cut her losses.

141
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,320
We're meant to be together.
I've never been so sure about anything.

142
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,240
Yeah, well, don't tell me, Clark.

143
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,240
Tell her.

144
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,680
- Hey.
- Hey.

145
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,080
Come on.

146
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,040
- Lana, last night was a big deal for me.
- Clark.

147
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,720
Look, you don't have to avoid calling me
if you don't feel the same way.

148
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,920
No, it meant a lot to me too.

149
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,800
Everything seemed so clear, but today
it just feels a lot more complicated.

150
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,640
Is this about Chloe?

151
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,880
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't worried about her...

152
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,640
...but there are three friendships at stake
here, and I don't wanna risk losing ours.

153
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,560
The friendship isn't gonna go anywhere.
It'll just become something better.

154
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,000
And what happens down the road
if things don't work out?

155
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,320
- Will our friendship survive that?
- I don't know.

156
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,880
Lana, I've wanted this for so long,
I think it's worth taking the chance.

157
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,680
The day is coming.

158
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,000
Clark?

159
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,320
Are you all right?

160
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,080
The day is coming.

161
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
Clark, what is it?

162
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,120
I'm sorry, I have to go.

163
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,240
The day is coming.

164
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,880
The day is coming.
The day is coming.

165
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,040
- What do you think it means?
- It's probably just delusional rambling.

166
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,440
But your scans say his
brain activity is normal again.

167
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,080
The day is coming.

168
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,560
Does that look normal to you?

169
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,400
The day is coming.
The day is coming...

170
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,080
The cataracts, they're gone.

171
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,440
They faded during
the course of a day.

172
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,960
- How do you explain that?
- I can't.

173
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,200
I know you want to see if he says
anything else, but for his own safety...

174
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,360
...I need to sedate him.
- The day is coming! The day is...

175
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,760
The day is coming.

176
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,640
I think it says,
"The day is coming."

177
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,480
- You learned how to read the symbols?
- No, just an educated guess.

178
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,920
It's what Walden kept
saying before he escaped.

179
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
I wonder how he wrote it.

180
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,880
Apparently, he's developed the ability to
emit some kind of energy from his hands.

181
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,880
I think maybe it has something to do with
whatever happened to him in the cave.

182
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,800
Why are you telling me all this?

183
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,440
You found him, Clark.

184
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,880
Just wondering if you could shed
any more light on the situation.

185
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,560
I've already told you
everything I know.

186
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,440
These symbols...

187
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,120
...they look like the one on your barn.

188
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,040
Lex, I told you. I don't know
how to read this language.

189
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,200
I believe you, Clark.

190
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,760
Then what am I doing here?

191
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,640
I thought, based on our
mutual interest in the cave...

192
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,240
...we could solve this mystery together.

193
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,240
I'm sorry, Lex.
I'm as mystified as you are.

194
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,480
I know who you are.

195
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,200
Hey, Helen.

196
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,680
Are you planning a rehearsal
dinner or a peace summit?

197
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,160
This whole wedding is starting
to feel just as political.

198
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,520
It's hard to know
what side everybody's on.

199
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,400
You're not having
second thoughts, are you?

200
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,840
Sorry, l...

201
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:15,080
- It's all gotten very complicated.
- Sounds kind of familiar.

202
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,080
You wouldn't be talking about a tall,
dark, handsome best man, would you?

203
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,360
If you knew that Lex was
keeping secrets from you...

204
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,760
...but he was being truthful
about the important things like...

205
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,560
Like the way he feels about you.

206
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,560
Would that be enough?

207
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,000
I guess you have to decide.

208
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,280
Is the part of themselves that
they're willing to share with you...

209
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,400
...better than not having
them in your life at all?

210
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,760
You don't really think he's
hidden it in here, do you?

211
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,280
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm talking about the valuable object...

212
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,600
...Lex stole from your office.

213
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,720
Lex would never steal from me.

214
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,120
If you believe that, what are you doing
rummaging around in here while he's out?

215
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,520
How do I know you didn't
break into my office?

216
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,400
Oh, my. It seems I've antagonized
the lady of the house.

217
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,960
Please, would you tell my son
I dropped by to offer my best wishes?

218
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,480
Oh, no.

219
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,640
That would be difficult,
wouldn't it?

220
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,720
Because we'd have to explain
that we ran into each other...

221
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,720
...when we were in here and
I caught you snooping and...

222
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Oh, that could get really messy.

223
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,800
Especially with your
wedding day almost upon us.

224
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,640
Get out.

225
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,640
Can I ask you a question, Helen?

226
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,960
Why are you marrying Lex?

227
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,320
Because I love him.

228
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,280
Dr. Walden?

229
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,840
It's me, Clark Kent.

230
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,320
Dr. Walden.

231
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,560
Are you down here?

232
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,400
Interesting, isn't it?

233
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,480
- Mr. Luthor.
- That...

234
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,400
...octagonal recess
in the wall, I mean.

235
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:05,040
I once had what you might call
a keepsake that matched this.

236
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,800
Exactly.

237
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,600
Just disappeared from my office.

238
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,680
It was that same day you rescued
your mother and me.

239
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,240
What are you doing down here?

240
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,760
I have taken over
conservatorship of the caves.

241
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,640
- Didn't Lex tell you?
- No, he didn't.

242
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,880
He just doesn't want to admit defeat,
and he's still fighting me on this.

243
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,680
I ran into some of his
security people down here.

244
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,800
They were looking for that doctor.
Dr...?

245
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,360
Dr. Walden?

246
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Dr. Walden was obsessed
with these caves.

247
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,240
Well, I could understand why.

248
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,080
Look at this.

249
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,680
These symbols...

250
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,120
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
They are...

251
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,120
Are they arranged in a different...

252
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,240
...order than they were before?

253
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,920
That's strange.

254
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,600
Don't you think, Clark?

255
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,640
It's all Kawatche to me.

256
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,360
If you see Dr. Walden, be careful.

257
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,920
He could be dangerous.

258
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,960
I don't get it.

259
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,280
First the refined kryptonite,
now the caves.

260
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,800
What does Luthor want?

261
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,280
I don't know, but I think
we have a bigger problem.

262
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,760
Dr. Walden can read Krypton language.
He wrote it on the ceiling at the hospital.

263
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,680
- You think he's figured out your secret?
- Is that why you're so worried now?

264
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,440
I'm not sure, but something's
going on in that cave.

265
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,480
The symbols have changed.

266
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,160
- What does it say now, son?
- "The day is coming...

267
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,040
...when the last son will begin
his quest to rule the third planet."

268
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,040
- Clark.
- Don't you see? I'm the last son.

269
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,640
Why humiliate yourself
like this, Dad?

270
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,480
When are you gonna accept
the fact that you're not invited?

271
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,280
You know, Lex, I'm not here to grovel
for a place at your table.

272
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,960
I wanted to tell you that...

273
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:29,880
...your restraining order to keep me out of
the Kawatche caves has been rejected.

274
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,840
Flat out.

275
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,400
And you couldn't have had your lawyers
tell my lawyers that over the phone?

276
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,760
It's curious, though...

277
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,840
...your renewed interest seems to come
right on the heels of Dr. Walden's escape.

278
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,200
And Clark Kent seems
to share your opinion.

279
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,000
He was down there too,
looking for your linguist.

280
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,720
Lex!

281
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,600
- I did it, Lex.
- Dr. Walden.

282
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,320
I finally read the wall.

283
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,680
I know what it says.

284
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,640
We'll talk all about it,
but first we need to get you help.

285
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,000
- Let the man tell us.
- Stay out of this.

286
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
The wall, doctor,
what does it say?

287
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,240
"The last son will rule the planet."

288
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,680
Don't you see?

289
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,880
It's Clark Kent!

290
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,720
- I think that's a pretty big leap.
- No.

291
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,920
I've never seen
more clearly in my life.

292
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,800
- I know exactly what has to be done.
- What is that, doctor?

293
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,000
We have to kill Clark Kent.

294
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,480
Before he destroys us all.

295
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,600
Dr. Walden, you're confused.

296
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,920
"Dear guests..."

297
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,080
No, it's gotta be something else.

298
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,920
"Friend..."
"Friends and family..."

299
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,760
First line's always the hardest.

300
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,680
- Hey, Chloe, what's up?
- Big news.

301
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,600
Your friend Dr. Walden woke up.

302
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,240
I wouldn't exactly call him
a friend of mine.

303
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,720
I was just wondering if you wanted
to come out of retirement...

304
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,280
...and do the story with me.

305
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,720
Hey, I appreciate the offer,
but now really isn't a good time.

306
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,720
I didn't mean right this second, Clark.

307
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,760
I wish things could be like they were.

308
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,560
Yeah, me too.

309
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,000
I just feel like there's this
huge rift between us...

310
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,800
...and no matter how hard I try,
I can't get back to you.

311
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,440
We'll get there, Chloe.
It's just gonna take a little bit of time.

312
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,760
Well, whatever happens,
let's just...

313
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,440
Let's promise to be
honest with each other.

314
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,400
I mean, you're a big boy, I'm a big girl.
I think we can handle it.

315
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,480
As long as we tell the truth.

316
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,040
Okay, well, I'd better get going.

317
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,760
You have your rehearsal dinner,
and I have the Torch. So...

318
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,880
Break a leg, Clark.

319
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,160
Sorry I'm late.

320
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,600
- Where have you been?
- Business crisis.

321
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,360
Don't worry, I'm all yours now.

322
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,280
I need a moment
with the best man.

323
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,520
Okay.

324
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,920
- Hello, Mrs. Kent.
- Everything is beautiful.

325
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,720
Thank you. Thank you very much.

326
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,520
- Hello, Lex.
- Hey.

327
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,360
- Mind if I have a word with your son?
- No, go right ahead.

328
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,200
- Is everything all right?
- Dr. Walden paid me a visit.

329
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,880
Nobody was hurt.

330
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,560
He's on his way back to the hospital.

331
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,000
- Well, that's good news.
- Clark, he was ranting about you.

332
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,720
- What'd he say?
- That the writing on the cave wall says...

333
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,480
...you're going to rule the world.

334
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,720
I'm gonna rule the world?

335
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,440
- He's obviously nuts.
- Of course he is.

336
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,480
Unfortunately, my father was there.
He heard the whole thing.

337
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,720
He didn't believe him, did he?

338
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,320
He quoted one of his
favorite Elizabethan poets.

339
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,560
Twixt truth and madness lies
But a sliver of a stream

340
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,040
He's not just gonna let this drop.

341
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,080
I thought I'd warn you.

342
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,240
I certainly do admire
your work ethic, Miss Sullivan.

343
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,440
- Late at night, here you are, still at it.
- Yeah.

344
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,280
Well, I wasn't invited
to the rehearsal dinner, so...

345
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,320
Yes, we have a lot in common.

346
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,080
I spoke to the managing editor
of the Daily Planet. It's all set.

347
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:49,000
A weekly column on current affairs
from the young person's perspective.

348
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,400
I don't know how to thank you.

349
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,640
Nurturing a promising
young talent is a reward in itself.

350
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,960
And I've got your first assignment.

351
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,320
A complete investigative
profile of Clark Kent.

352
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,960
What possible interest could the Daily
Planet have in a farm boy from Smallville?

353
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,560
This isn't for the Daily Planet. They'll
be in touch with you. No, this is for me.

354
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,960
Just combine it with any research
about his family you already have.

355
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,640
I blew off my journalistic skepticism...

356
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,120
...and allowed myself
to actually believe...

357
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,840
...that you were interested
in just helping me.

358
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,920
You're playing in the real world now,
Miss Sullivan.

359
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,960
You have to give to get.

360
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,200
Mr. Luthor. I don't know
what your interest is in Clark...

361
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,960
...but you can take the offer and shove
it down your thousand-dollar pants.

362
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,920
Clark's very lucky
to have a friend like you.

363
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,360
All that integrity.

364
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,120
I wonder, though, if he had to make
a choice, would he sacrifice his dream...

365
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,280
...out of loyalty to you?

366
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,560
Any change?

367
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,080
No, he'll be out for hours.

368
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,920
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

369
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,480
I think Lex picked me to be
the best man because he knew...

370
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,080
...how comfortable I was
speaking in front of people.

371
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,080
I've been looking through every book
from Socrates to Shakespeare...

372
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,000
...trying to find someone
who can put into words the way...

373
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,160
...Lex and Helen
feel about each other.

374
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,280
But what I realized is,
there are no words for it.

375
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,560
That when you have it,
you trust it.

376
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
You believe in it.

377
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,800
Take a chance on it.

378
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,440
You're willing to sacrifice
anything to keep it.

379
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,800
No matter what the cost.

380
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,640
- To Helen and Lex.
- To Helen and Lex.

381
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,480
Thanks.

382
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,200
- Clark, are you all right?
- Yeah...

383
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,160
...I just gotta get some air.

384
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,520
- Clark.
- Son.

385
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,400
- What's the matter?
- It's the key.

386
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,440
There's something wrong at home.
I have to go.

387
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,040
I came looking for you.

388
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,840
And I found the proof.

389
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,000
You...

390
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,840
...are the one.

391
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,120
Dr. Walden, listen to me.

392
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,400
- You need help.
- No.

393
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,040
You need to die.

394
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,760
Dr. Walden...

395
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,600
Dr. Walden, no!

396
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,000
- Doctor, you're making a mistake.
- No, I'm not. I'm doing this for mankind.

397
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,000
With the exception of Clark's migraine...

398
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,360
...I thought the evening
was mercifully uneventful.

399
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,880
What's wrong?

400
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,960
Nothing.

401
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,480
If we're gonna spend our lives together,
we need to be honest with each other.

402
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,080
You're always saying that.

403
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,600
I found a file on Mrs. Kent
in your bookshelf.

404
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,720
It contained confidential
medical records.

405
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,280
From my office.

406
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:33,560
I got that from a Disease Control agent
who was investigating Mrs. Kent's case.

407
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,520
You mean you bribed someone for it.

408
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,040
I've told you...

409
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,280
...the Kents are very important to me.
I was concerned about Martha's health.

410
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,600
What were you looking for, anyway?

411
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,560
Something that was stolen
from my office.

412
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,880
Do you think I was involved
in the break-in?

413
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,200
Please tell me you weren't.

414
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,360
If you really believe I'm capable
of that kind of deceit...

415
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,400
...maybe you
shouldn't be marrying me.

416
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,200
Maybe you're right.

417
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,040
I had to pry it from his hand.

418
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,640
It wasn't your fault, Clark.

419
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,280
The man tried to kill you.
He was delusional.

420
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,480
Even the sheriff agreed, son. Walden
was responsible for his own death.

421
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,720
What if he was right?

422
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,040
- What if I am a threat to mankind?
- I'll never believe that.

423
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,640
And neither should you.

424
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,640
What does it mean? The day is coming
when I'll begin my quest to rule?

425
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,720
We don't know, son.

426
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,480
But when and if that day does come...

427
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,680
...your mother and I both know
that you'll do the right thing.

428
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,280
His entire body's been burned
beyond recognition.

429
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,840
But look.

430
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,640
Whatever he was holding here,
it protected the skin it was covering.

431
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,360
I've never seen anything like this.

432
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,040
Send it to me.

433
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,880
Send you what?

434
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,240
The hand.

435
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,400
I never got a chance to tell you
how beautiful you look tonight.

436
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,080
Clark, you scared me.

437
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,920
Surprised me.

438
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,640
Just wanted to see you.
Kind of ran out on dinner.

439
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,720
I thought your toast
was really beautiful.

440
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,760
I had a lot of inspiration.

441
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,920
Sorry I've been so confused about us.

442
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,440
It's just...

443
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,640
I'm scared.

444
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,320
So am I.

445
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,480
You have so many secrets in your life.

446
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,760
I know.

447
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,800
I just don't want my feelings
for you to be one of them.

448
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,640
Neither do I.

449
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,400
Kal-EI, it is time.

450
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,640
Kal-EI, it is time.
