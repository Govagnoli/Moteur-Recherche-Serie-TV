1
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:51,041
Hello? Is someone there?

2
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:52,135
- Damn it, boy, what were you thinking?
- I'm sorry, Father. It won't happen again.

3
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,810
What is the one rule
we live by in this house?

4
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,482
Byron stays in the cellar.

5
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,015
And why is that?

6
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,246
Because Father knows
what's best for Byron.

7
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,554
How the hell did you get out?

8
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,991
I swear, you'd better give me
an answer right now, or I'm gonna...

9
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,564
I pried open the lock.

10
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,830
Get out again, boy, there will be
more than a tranquilizer in that gun.

11
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,682
The sentiment's nice...

12
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,411
...but the fact that you found this
in a graveyard seems a little Amityville.

13
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:45,183
I think it's romantic. I haven't
gotten a love letter since third grade.

14
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,417
- Seems like a lost art.
- Not true, not true.

15
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:51,291
This morning in trig, I intercepted
a note from a wrestler to a cheerleader.

16
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:55,195
It wasn't exactly poetic,
but he definitely got his point across.

17
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,734
- Who do you think wrote it?
- I have no idea.

18
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,303
Hey, guys.

19
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:05,470
- So, what's going on?
- Lana has a secret admirer.

20
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,948
- It's nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

21
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,346
What happened to romantic?

22
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,008
Just let the boy read it.

23
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,587
- It's a little mushy.
- I almost forgot.

24
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,995
Clark Kent, the man of steel.

25
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,433
I'll see you guys later.

26
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,636
- Bye.
- Bye.

27
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:44,141
If you ask me, it sounds more
like a stalker than a secret admirer.

28
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,456
- Thanks.
- No problem.

29
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,564
That's kind of personal.

30
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,272
Go ahead and read it. You'll probably
agree with Clark that it's sappy.

31
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,745
The imagery's a little naive, but the meter's
actually quite sophisticated.

32
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,216
Who wrote this?

33
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:58,221
Either an admirer or a psychopath,
depending on who you ask.

34
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,019
That had a little edge to it,
is everything all right?

35
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:06,560
Everyone's giving me a hard time about
the poem. I guess I'm just a little defensive.

36
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,895
Take me to you

37
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,897
Imprison me

38
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:17,302
For I never shall be free
Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me

39
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,241
John Donne.
He's one of my favorites.

40
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,980
If I didn't know better,
I'd say I found your Achilles' heel.

41
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,652
I didn't realize you were so into poetry.

42
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,224
Anyone who doesn't appreciate poetry...

43
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,885
...doesn't understand
that it's all about seduction.

44
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,930
It's nice some people
appreciate artistic expression.

45
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:52,766
It kind of raises the bar for
any other contenders, doesn't it, Clark?

46
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,750
- I know things aren't great between us...
- I'm fine, Clark.

47
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,695
Lana, I want to apologize
for ragging on the poem.

48
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:13,229
Guess poetry's not for everybody.

49
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:18,297
I was just surprised that you would show
Pete and Chloe and not show it to me.

50
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:22,838
You can't expect me to share everything
if you're not going to be open with me.

51
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,142
Don't you think it's weird? This guy's
sneaking around watching you.

52
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:34,713
Come on, Clark. Tell me you've never
watched somebody from afar.

53
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,188
So as you can see, sir...

54
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,424
...or maybe not
actually see in your case...

55
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,034
...it was an honest mistake...

56
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:55,470
...and one that I promise won't ever happen
again as long as I'm working for you.

57
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,072
Thank you, Tad.

58
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:03,739
That was a very heartfelt, if
not interminably long-winded, apology.

59
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,246
And I'm going to help
you keep that promise.

60
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,012
Tad...

61
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:13,181
...your things will be mailed to you.

62
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,357
Are you letting me go?

63
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:20,564
Never lose that grasp of the obvious, Tad.
It's one of your strongest attributes.

64
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,002
That's the fourth one
you've devoured this month.

65
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:34,776
- Where you finding these people, Lex?
- Little schools, like Harvard and Yale.

66
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,848
I spent hours going over resumes,
looking for the perfect fit.

67
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,448
You mustn't be fooled by a resume, Lex.

68
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:45,751
You have to look into their eyes
to see if they're up to the challenge.

69
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,519
I need your eyes to look for me, son.

70
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:52,560
I see. So somehow the failure
of your assistants is my fault.

71
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:57,066
Forget the self-pity, Lex,
I wasn't criticizing. I was critiquing.

72
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,805
There's a difference.

73
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,038
And if I recall, I didn't
ask for help. You offered.

74
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,576
I'm glad to see your condition
hasn't softened your paternal side.

75
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,807
My condition has nothing to do with it.

76
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:14,180
You're not the master of your universe
anymore, and it's killing you.

77
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,514
Just get me an assistant
who meets my criteria.

78
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:21,922
- I don't think I would fit your criteria.
- Probably not, but nobody's perfect.

79
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:33,664
At the sound of the opening bell on the
stock exchange floor Monday morning...

80
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,108
...LuthorCorp stock adjusted dramatically
after weeks of speculation as to...

81
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:45,044
I couldn't listen to another word
of that droning either.

82
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,577
- Who is that?
- It's Martha Kent.

83
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,989
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

84
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,857
No, no. It's a welcome interruption.

85
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,964
I came by to pick up the produce check
from Lex. He usually leaves it out for me.

86
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:07,096
I'm afraid my presence here has thrown
Lex's regimented routine into a mild chaos.

87
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:12,242
Well, I'm sure he's happy to have you here,
even if he doesn't know how to say it.

88
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:15,306
Your assumption's very generous.

89
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,697
"The plummeting stock sent a ripple
through investment houses.

90
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:38,701
CEO Lionel Luthor attributed the drop
to this quarter's anticipated deficit."

91
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,304
It's a smoke screen, isn't it?

92
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:44,068
To make investors nervous so when
LuthorCorp posts less impressive gains...

93
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:48,771
...the stock will have already adjusted.
- I had no idea Martha Kent...

94
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,075
...had such keen business acumen.

95
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:57,181
I wonder if your talents aren't
being wasted on organic produce.

96
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,721
I'm going to take that as a compliment.

97
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,726
You should.

98
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:43,527
I bought you this. At the used bookstore.

99
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,134
Edgar Allan Poe.

100
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,208
You really know
how to pick them, Mother.

101
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:55,905
Well, I read a couple of pages.
I couldn't make heads or tails.

102
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,711
I'm surprised.

103
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,989
He writes about pain and suffering...

104
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,489
...and people being buried alive.

105
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:12,730
Byron, I know you're upset,
but things are better this way.

106
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,059
How can you let him do this to me?

107
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,830
You have put your father
through enough.

108
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,996
Just be glad things are back to normal.

109
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,839
Normal kids aren't hunted
by their fathers.

110
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:28,739
I don't want to hear another word.
You just stick to your books...

111
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,542
...and keep your mouth shut.

112
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:33,617
Everything will be fine.

113
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,200
What am I doing? This is crazy.

114
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:02,006
Wait! I got your other poem.

115
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,835
It was beautiful.

116
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,602
You really think so?

117
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,877
What's your name?

118
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,381
Byron.

119
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:22,959
- Like the poet?
- Like my great-uncle.

120
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,556
But there's nothing poetic about him.

121
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,493
Why do you leave me these poems?

122
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,126
Because you inspire me.

123
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,003
No, don't!

124
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,641
Get away from her!

125
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,369
Clark!

126
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,912
Oh, my God.

127
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,611
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

128
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,146
Fine.

129
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,342
I can't believe I passed out.

130
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,938
I'm sorry I scared you.

131
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,441
It's okay, Clark.

132
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,142
You were protecting a beautiful young lady.

133
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,151
It was chivalrous.

134
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,857
You're lucky to have a boyfriend
who cares so much about you.

135
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,092
Clark's just a friend.

136
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,161
An overprotective one.

137
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,929
If I could write the beauty of your eyes

138
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,935
And number all your graces

139
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,944
The age to come would say
"This poet lies

140
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,580
Such heavenly touches
Ne'er touched earthly faces"

141
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,252
That was beautiful.

142
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,284
Which poet wrote that?

143
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,155
Shakespeare.

144
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,997
I can't imagine being home-schooled
and never seeing anybody.

145
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,602
You don't miss what you never had.

146
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,773
Seems like you don't get out much.
Are your parents pretty strict?

147
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,978
They only want what's best for me.

148
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,518
Oh, my God.
That's our milk delivery.

149
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,989
- What time is it?
- Quarter to five.

150
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,387
If my parents wake up...

151
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,504
Do you want us to tell
your parents what happened?

152
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,404
No, I'll be fine.

153
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,111
Byron, hurry!

154
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,543
I warned you not to leave, boy.

155
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,017
No! No!

156
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,454
Byron!

157
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,788
- Go away!
- Come on!

158
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,227
I'd better not catch you
around my son again!

159
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,603
Get out before I shoot you
for trespassing!

160
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:38,118
- Lionel Luthor offered you a job?
- I was just as surprised as you are.

161
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,727
- What'd you tell him?
- That I wanted to discuss it with you.

162
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,434
You know I've been thinking
about going back to work for a while.

163
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,801
Why with him? You know
he's got an ulterior motive for everything.

164
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:59,569
I know all about Lionel Luthor,
but we could use the money.

165
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,181
And I could use
a bigger challenge in my life.

166
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,840
Oh, I understand. Farm life's gotten
a little too boring for you, hasn't it?

167
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,180
I didn't mean it like that.

168
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,656
This is a chance for me
to put my education to use.

169
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,259
Even at the risk of losing
our privacy here?

170
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,223
You don't trust me to make that call?

171
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,758
I want to do this.

172
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:21,991
Martha...

173
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,201
Clark?

174
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,565
Lana, you two been out all night?

175
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,101
No, it's not what you think.

176
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,910
We met this kid and we think
his parents are abusing him.

177
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,974
Mrs. Moore?

178
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,814
I'm sorry to disturb you,
but I'd like to speak to your son.

179
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,621
- I'm afraid that's not possible, sheriff.
- Where is he?

180
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,122
Clark, let the sheriff handle this, please.

181
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,722
He's not in any trouble.

182
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,798
Look, I don't know what the hell's
going on here, sheriff...

183
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,558
...but our son is dead.

184
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,828
He drowned out
in Crater Lake eight years ago.

185
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,670
We just met him last night.

186
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,969
My son says that you threatened him.

187
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,841
I've never seen
these kids before in my life.

188
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,483
Look, it's taken all these years
to get past this...

189
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,951
...and then you show up
and pull a prank like this.

190
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:54,889
What kind of parent would raise a child
to do a wicked thing like that?

191
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,723
We're awfully sorry.
Look, Jonathan, I think we should go.

192
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,136
- They're lying.
- We saw him go in that house.

193
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,568
- This is a very awkward situation.
- I know it is, Ethan.

194
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,938
But if that young man's in trouble,
we wouldn't want that on our conscience.

195
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,904
I'll get a warrant.

196
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,998
It looks like your tortured artist is
a member of the dead poets society.

197
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,767
The certificate of death was signed
by Dr. Emil Jenkins.

198
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,307
It's gotta be fake.

199
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,914
Not that I don't trust your judgment,
but could it be possible that goth boy is...?

200
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,984
I don't think a ghost could polish off
three pieces of cake and two cappuccinos.

201
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,845
I was just checking.
I mean, this is Smallville.

202
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:02,153
I ran Dr. Jenkins' name through the
computer and found something interesting.

203
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:06,787
Eight years ago, he supervised a medical
trial over at Metron Pharmaceuticals.

204
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,728
Let me guess, Byron was a participant.

205
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,734
Yeah, they were all kids who
had exhibited antisocial behavior.

206
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,270
But that doesn't sound like Byron,
he's so gentle.

207
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,399
Could it be that our new Shakespeare has
stirred the heart of our young Juliet?

208
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:24,675
It's nice to meet someone so honest,
I don't have to guess what they're thinking.

209
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,684
- We have to start looking for Byron.
- No, we should see what the sheriff finds.

210
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:41,531
Chopin? I always thought you found him
to be too sentimental.

211
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,660
No, Lex, I find that he
sometimes lacks subtlety.

212
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,198
Sometimes.

213
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:53,268
I take it from your tone
you're angry with me.

214
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,640
What transgression
have I committed now?

215
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,806
I wasted yesterday
interviewing more prospects...

216
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,919
...only to find you've hired Mrs. Kent.

217
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,953
- What's your angle, Dad?
- Angle?

218
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:09,924
Martha Kent is a very capable woman.

219
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,825
Unshakable honesty like hers...

220
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,057
...it's hard to come by.

221
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:19,135
She just happens to be one of the few
pillars of this community who could...

222
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:23,934
...ingratiate a despised tycoon
to the citizens of Smallville.

223
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,737
I hadn't thought of it in those terms.

224
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,642
I suppose that is an unexpected benefit.

225
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,409
I don't know what your sudden interest is
in the Kents...

226
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,553
...but I want you to stay away from them.
They mean a lot to me.

227
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:41,381
And I wonder what they would think
of your trying to meddle in their affairs.

228
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,395
You think if you're a very good boy,
they'll welcome you into their family?

229
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:50,361
Well, it would certainly be a step up.

230
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,839
You know, Lex, Zeus had a son...

231
00:22:56,007 --> 00:23:01,946
...an adopted son, who thought
he could find a home among mortals.

232
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,049
You know what happened
to the well-intentioned Prometheus?

233
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:10,180
His dad had him chained to a rock
and his liver was eaten by vultures. Why?

234
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,217
Prometheus was immortal, Lex.

235
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,691
No matter how much he wanted
to escape the world he was born into...

236
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,797
...the world of the gods, he
never could. It wasn't possible.

237
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:23,025
If I find out that you have any agenda
that could hurt the Kents...

238
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:26,261
...this amiable father-son detente
will come to an abrupt end.

239
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,433
What happened to waiting
for the sheriff?

240
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,297
I need to know if Byron's in here.

241
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:13,343
You're a regular Dr. Doolittle.

242
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,489
This place is like an NRA petting zoo.

243
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,072
There's something under this rug.

244
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,716
It's lead, that's why
I couldn't see through it.

245
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:49,718
That's good to know. You ought to think
about publishing an instruction manual.

246
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,981
Watch the door.

247
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,873
Byron, what did they do to you?

248
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,068
It's not what you think.

249
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:16,009
I have to get you out of here.

250
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,378
- How did you do that?
- Rusty lock. Come on!

251
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:25,216
Don't! Last time I went out
during the day, I hurt my dad!

252
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,324
No one deserves
to be locked up like this.

253
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:28,720
You don't understand!

254
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,988
Trust me, Byron.
I understand more than you know.

255
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,493
No!

256
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,692
Leave me alone!

257
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,704
Byron, you okay?

258
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,112
You should have listened to me.

259
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:03,886
What are you looking at?

260
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:06,390
- Byron, it's okay.
- Get away from me!

261
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,241
Pete?

262
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:37,558
Pete, I saw your mom downstairs,
are you all right?

263
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,195
Yeah.

264
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,991
The doctors say
it's a hairline fracture...

265
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:45,933
...which is ironic because it hurts
everywhere else except my hairline.

266
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,594
Oh, sweetie.

267
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:52,465
Being part of this family should come
with its own group health insurance.

268
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:56,042
I thought we agreed you were gonna
wait for Sheriff Ethan.

269
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:59,240
Dad, they had Byron locked in
the basement, chained to the wall.

270
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:02,147
When Clark carried him out,
he went Jekyll and Hyde on us.

271
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,016
- I tried to stop him.
- You tried?

272
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,420
How big of a change
are we talking about here?

273
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,486
You really shouldn't be here.

274
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:17,431
My husband is out looking for Byron,
but he'll be back soon.

275
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,866
My son feels responsible.

276
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,540
We want to help.

277
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:23,731
You just...

278
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:27,742
You can't imagine how hard it was
for both of us.

279
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,180
You probably think we're
horrible parents.

280
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:40,285
When I took Byron out into the light,
why did he change?

281
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,317
It was one of the side effects
of the drug.

282
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,521
He can't be out in the sun.

283
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,757
I wish we'd never gotten
involved in that mess.

284
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,362
They promised...

285
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,702
...that the drug
would make him better...

286
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,205
...would make him normal.

287
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:00,911
There's gotta be somebody somewhere
that can help your son.

288
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,047
We tried everything.

289
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:07,014
Dr. Jenkins watched six other boys die...

290
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,847
...trying to reverse the side effects.

291
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:12,988
They had Byron hooked up
to all those machines...

292
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,924
...like he was some sort of alien.

293
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,221
Is that why you faked
his death certificate?

294
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:23,130
We didn't know what to do.

295
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,628
Finally, we locked him
in the cellar.

296
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:30,404
He cried, for days.
He didn't understand...

297
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:33,274
...why we had to keep him down here.

298
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,048
We felt like the monsters.

299
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:42,012
If I get Byron out of the sun,
will he change back?

300
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,181
Yeah.

301
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:48,348
He's so strong now,
I don't know how anybody could do that.

302
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:04,673
I just got back from seeing Pete. He told
me what happened. Thanks for the call.

303
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,676
- Look, Lana, l...
- Why did you lie to me, Clark?

304
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,406
Byron's my friend, and I wanted to help.
You cut me out.

305
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:14,278
- I didn't want you to get hurt.
- Is that it, or don't you trust me?

306
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,491
- You haven't seen Byron, have you?
- No.

307
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,787
But if I had, you'd know already.
I'd have been honest with you.

308
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:29,332
Okay, I think I figured out why our would-be
Shakespeare went all pro-wrestler on you.

309
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,535
Jeez, is it just me,
or did it get cold in here?

310
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:37,736
What'd you find?

311
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:42,811
The drug that Byron was given during the
medical trials targeted his adrenal system.

312
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:46,414
It says they were looking for a cure.
We need to track down the company.

313
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:50,213
It's too late. Metron was shut down
before they even finished their research.

314
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,855
Why would they do that?

315
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:54,753
I don't know. Maybe Clark
should ask his mom's new boss.

316
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,889
Lionel Luthor owns Metron.

317
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:02,396
Just one of the many LuthorCorp
subsidiaries that promises a brighter future.

318
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,864
I'll talk to Lex.

319
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:09,573
I'd love to help you, but Pete just sent out
an SOS for his PlayStation 2, so good luck.

320
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,145
- Where are you going?
- To look for Byron.

321
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:19,147
Wait, Lana. My dad, Mr. Moore and half
the sheriff's department are out searching.

322
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,946
- So I should just stay here and pour coffee?
- I'm saying you should be careful.

323
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:26,579
Byron's not the same guy.
If you see him, don't get too close.

324
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,459
Call someone.

325
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,845
Byron.

326
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,954
It's me, Lana.
I want to help you.

327
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:06,625
I was down there for eight years,
I'm not going back.

328
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,724
You could hurt people like this.
The Byron I met wouldn't want that.

329
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,930
I know who did this to you.
It was LuthorCorp.

330
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:16,801
Clark's talking to Luthor's son.
They can find a cure.

331
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,670
There is no cure!

332
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,637
- Byron, no!
- I want you!

333
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,817
They made me into someone
no one can love.

334
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,278
Not even you!

335
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,064
Another mark on the Luthor name.

336
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,133
My father's leaving me quite a legacy.

337
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,537
You might give your mom a heads up.

338
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,043
If she's gonna work for my father,
this is what she's getting into.

339
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,148
My mother can take care of herself, Lex.

340
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:02,218
Besides, I haven't seen her
this excited in a long time.

341
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,885
To tell you the truth, Clark,
I was a little surprised...

342
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:09,254
...considering my offers to ease
your family's financial situation...

343
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,827
...have been
met with a resounding no...

344
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:14,897
...it stung a little to see her name
on my father's payroll.

345
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:19,230
Well, to be honest, it wasn't exactly a
unanimous decision at the Kent household.

346
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,237
My father's the poster boy
for family strife.

347
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,466
I'm sorry it's spreading.

348
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:28,203
Look at it this way, Lex, at least
my father's not upset with you this time.

349
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,940
I'll look into Metron, see where my
father's hiding the proverbial bodies.

350
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:37,144
Now, I have to head over to the plant. Some
Luthors actually have to work for a living.

351
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:46,558
Wow, I didn't realize the traffic
in Smallville had gotten so bad.

352
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:50,030
It's my father.
I hope your mom likes helicopters.

353
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,964
My family doesn't fly much.

354
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,594
Trust me, that's about to change.

355
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,669
I'll talk to you later, Clark.

356
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,145
Watch your head.

357
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:12,980
All right!

358
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,853
- It's this one here.
- What?

359
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,019
This one.

360
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,058
First time in a helicopter, Martha?

361
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:26,203
I wasn't expecting a trip to Metropolis
on my first day.

362
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,866
All right, Bob, we're off!

363
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,302
Yes, sir.

364
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:42,784
- What's happening, Bob?
- I don't know!

365
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,085
What's happening?

366
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:51,486
Bob?

367
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,304
Oh, my God!

368
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,328
- What is it?
- We have to get out of here! Come on!

369
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:29,488
Martha!

370
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,706
- Luthor!
- Who the hell are you?

371
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,569
Oh, no!

372
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:42,979
You did this to me!

373
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,912
Did what?

374
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,580
What are you talking about?

375
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,166
I don't want to have to hurt you, Byron.

376
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:09,329
- We gotta get you out of the light.
- No! You can't stop me!

377
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:13,871
Clark!

378
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:54,979
Clark?

379
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,579
It's okay, Byron.

380
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,348
You're gonna be all right.

381
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,367
Clark.

382
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,175
Hey, I brought you some light reading.

383
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,347
They're a lost art form.

384
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:32,889
I don't remember our fight,
but I cannot believe I didn't hurt you.

385
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,416
Some people are just lucky.

386
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:43,196
- Hey, how's the wrist?
- It'll be better in a couple of days.

387
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:48,734
- I can't believe l...
- Hey, don't worry about it.

388
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,134
I know it wasn't you.

389
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,143
You were brave to come and find me.

390
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:58,612
A friend warned me to be careful.
I should have listened to him.

391
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:04,950
Let me see your hand.

392
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:36,249
- Dad, I heard what happened. Are you okay?
- I'm relatively unscathed...

393
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,980
...thanks to Martha and Clark.

394
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:40,785
Clark?

395
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,460
He's a rather extraordinary young man,
don't you think?

396
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:50,398
Hi, Lex. I spoke to the foundation...

397
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:53,128
...and they can transfer the funds
into the new account.

398
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:58,838
Seven hours on the clock, and you're
already laundering money for my father?

399
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:04,346
I'm convincing him to fund new research
into Byron Moore's condition. You okay?

400
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:08,652
I'm sure my father informed you
LuthorCorp is not in the charity business.

401
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,821
I did, I did.

402
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:14,651
Then I explained that he'll spend less
helping this boy live a normal life...

403
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:19,421
...than he would on advertising to restore
consumer confidence in LuthorCorp.

404
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,558
The papers will be here tomorrow
for you to sign.

405
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,692
- See you in the morning.
- All right.

406
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,833
Lex...

407
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:37,176
...I can feel your smirk from here.

408
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,847
Better watch it, Dad...

409
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:43,646
...or your new executive assistant
might start rearranging all your priorities.

410
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:55,431
You pulled one of your trademark
disappearing acts last night.

411
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:59,463
I figured you could use
some time alone with Byron.

412
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:09,476
Sonnets? Not exactly your usual reading.

413
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,740
Byron was really into them.
I thought maybe I could learn something.

414
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,682
What'd you think?

415
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,586
They really weren't for me.

416
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:27,156
An honest answer. I like that.

417
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:31,897
I'm sorry for not being straight with you
from the beginning.

418
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,502
It's okay.

419
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:38,467
When I confronted Byron,
I got so scared.

420
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:41,110
First person I thought of was you.

421
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,607
Really?

422
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,114
I thought, "If Clark was here,
he'd know what to do."

423
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:53,085
Thought I could save him.
I just ended up making things worse.

424
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,917
You were trying to help a friend,
there's no harm in that.

425
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,392
I hope Byron's gonna be okay.

426
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,865
It doesn't bother you that he's so...?

427
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,761
Different?

428
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,803
If you really like someone,
you accept every part of them.

429
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:19,541
But you can't do that until they're willing
to share every part with you.

430
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:26,218
I think people like Byron...

431
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:30,918
He keeps a part of himself hidden
so he doesn't scare people away.

432
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:34,924
If you want to get close to someone,
you have to take that risk.

433
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,831
What if the risk is too big to take?

434
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:45,141
Then you might miss out on something
that could be pretty amazing.
