1
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,829
You're late.

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,558
Was there a problem
with the cash?

3
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,076
No, the money wasn't the problem.
I had to ditch my roommate.

4
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,958
You don't know my roommate.

5
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,677
Here, $2000, the rest of my savings.

6
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,270
No worries, Lana,
we're just about fixed for your fix.

7
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,398
This is not a drug trip.

8
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,996
Relax, Lance,
just a little syringe-speak humor.

9
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,230
I wasn't implying
that it's a hallucination.

10
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,400
Damn straight. This little cocktail
is my lock on a Nobel Prize.

11
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,792
And a big fat deal
with the pharmaceutical company.

12
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,872
I wanna stay down longer this time.

13
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,957
- Two minutes.
- Forget it.

14
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,988
- It's too dangerous.
- Come on, Lance.

15
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,630
It's only 20 seconds longer
than last time, and I almost found them.

16
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,199
What could it hurt?

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,312
I've been down almost as long.
You know you can bring her back.

18
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,271
Mom. Dad. Oh, my God.

19
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,273
I never thought I'd see you again.

20
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,150
- I've missed you so much.
- Oh, we've missed you too, honey.

21
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,678
I've just been so confused,
I didn't know where to turn.

22
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,391
- We know how hard it's been.
- I loved him so much.

23
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,548
- I thought I could handle it.
- We're here for you, Lana.

24
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,829
No! No! No...

25
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,319
- I got her.
- Lana, chill, you're good.

26
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,114
Back among the living.

27
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,840
You were gone too long.
We almost didn't get you back.

28
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,358
Wait. It wasn't long enough.
I have to go back.

29
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,110
Clark? We've got a problem.

30
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,597
Fast, but oddly formal.
Usually when I say it's <i>urgent...</i>

31
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,513
...you rip in here without the least regard
for my privacy.

32
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,389
- I didn't wanna disturb you.
- Don't worry, Lana's not here.

33
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,836
Actually,
she didn't come home at all last night.

34
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,591
It's not another guy. She's been
hanging out with these med students...

35
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,716
...and they keep really wicked hours.

36
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,793
But you know, Clark, it will happen.
Eventually she will find someone else.

37
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,997
Yeah, she deserves to be happy.
What's our crisis?

38
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,720
Mass destruction and death
in Central America.

39
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,475
And the possibility that your former
professor, Milton Fine, is involved.

40
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,791
- No, he's dead.
- I know we thought we saw him die.

41
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,871
But the only thing
we're really sure <i>of...</i>

42
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,589
...is that he disappeared,
and so did that ship.

43
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,154
- Where'd you get this?
- A source tipped me off.

44
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,918
- Catch you later, Lana.
- Yeah.

45
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,189
I'll call you later.

46
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,349
- Sorry.
- You guys are friends.

47
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,750
It was bound to happen sometime,
right?

48
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,835
I didn't think you'd be back.

49
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,231
So should I even bother asking
what you were up to last night?

50
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,039
Just hanging out, Chloe,
it was no big deal.

51
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,672
Maybe not, but it doesn't really look like
all nighters agree with you.

52
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,877
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

53
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,996
Because you don't look okay.

54
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,397
Lana, I know that clark's breakup's
been really difficult, but...

55
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,870
chloe, it's not like someone died.
All right? People break up every day.

56
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,110
It's not a big deal. I'll get over it.

57
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,598
In short, this minor tax increase...

58
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,149
...can make a major difference
in our public schools.

59
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,834
Senator, how do you feel
about clayton's <i>allegations...</i>

60
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,719
...that your proposal will drain money
from constituents...

61
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,199
...failing to help schools?

62
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,397
I'd be more than happy to respond
to the congressman's <i>concerns...</i>

63
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,120
...should Congressman Clayton
care to ask me in person.

64
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,989
- Thank you very much for coming.
- Well, thank you, senator.

65
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,392
Nice strategy, senator.

66
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,150
When attacked, don't hesitate,
come out fighting.

67
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,039
I meant what I said.
A public debate is what I'm hoping for.

68
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,316
I'd hate to have to go through this
every time.

69
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,951
You won't. It'll get easier once you've
made it clear you're a player.

70
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,190
I've... I brought you something.

71
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,875
Something that just might
give you a bit of an edge.

72
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,270
We're both going to that dinner
tomorrow night...

73
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,877
<i>...at</i> the governor's mansion.
A copy of my research.

74
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,793
Everything there is to know
about our dinner companions.

75
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,190
Believe it or not, Lionel,
I've done my homework.

76
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,352
I know each person's position
and what their voting record is.

77
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,636
What I don't know is
why you're doing this.

78
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,150
I am not trying to manipulate your vote,
Martha. Look at it.

79
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,589
- Congressman Clayton plays polo?
- His passion.

80
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,952
- His daughter's a gymnast.
- Olympic standard.

81
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,953
Look, it may be a political function,
but in my experience...

82
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,510
...the last thing anyone wants to do
over dinner is talk shop.

83
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,036
Just... It's another way
to connect with your colleagues.

84
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,997
Why don't we go together
tomorrow night?

85
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,628
I'll help you navigate
the rough waters.

86
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,471
Thank you.

87
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,199
But, Lionel, I hope you're not
expecting something on a personal level.

88
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,232
The two of us will never be
anything more than friends.

89
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,230
I understand.

90
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,472
Excuse me. Have you seen this man?

91
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,512
Can I see that?

92
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,711
Between the two is the labrum,
or articular cartilage.

93
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,714
Divide the deltoid and its attachments,
then you'll cut through the humerus.

94
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,111
Okay, you need to come through
the bone two inches below the joint.

95
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,271
- Lance.
- What are you doing here?

96
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,108
I have to do it again soon.

97
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,794
You keep your voice down.
You could get us expelled.

98
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,190
- Get out of here.
- No, wait.

99
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,672
I have to go back there again.
I have to see my parents.

100
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,831
All right, but it's gonna cost you.

101
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,391
- Five grand this time.
- No problem.

102
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,035
Don't move.

103
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,713
Lana?

104
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,433
My God, Lana, l...

105
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,592
I had no idea it was you.
I could have killed you.

106
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,070
If you needed money,
all you had to do was ask.

107
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,198
I know. Lex, I'm really sorry.

108
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,314
I didn't wanna have to lie to you.

109
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,948
- Just tell me what's wrong.
- There's nothing wrong with me.

110
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,919
You didn't wanna lie to me,
but you broke into my house...

111
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,752
...and tried to steal from me.

112
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,560
You're acting like a junkie
trying to find her next fix.

113
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,468
There's this guy at school.

114
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,679
- He's created these chemicals.
- So it is drugs.

115
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,477
No. It's not what you think.

116
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,428
They kill you,
and then they bring you back.

117
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,036
Lex, I died. I died and I came back.

118
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,110
I'm telling the truth.

119
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,355
I went to the other side...

120
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,917
...and I saw my parents.

121
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,393
It was beautiful.

122
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,077
No one understands the loss of a parent
more than I do.

123
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,355
And for you,
growing up without a mother or father...

124
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,715
...I can even understand taking whatever
chance you did to see them again.

125
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,599
But you have to look at yourself.

126
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,871
Look at what you've become.

127
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,518
This isn't what your parents
would have wanted for you.

128
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,476
Lex, I'm sorry. I just...

129
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,552
I wanted to see them so badly.

130
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,598
I'm just so alone.

131
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,034
I think maybe it's <i>time...</i>

132
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,671
...we both stop trying to hold on
to the people we've <i>lost...</i>

133
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,395
...and start turning to the ones
we still have in our lives.

134
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,589
Yeah, I think you're right.

135
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,955
- You're freezing.
- Oh, no, I'm okay.

136
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,270
No, I'm gonna get you a blanket.

137
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,475
- Senor Fine?
- Senor Fine.

138
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,919
Hello?

139
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,638
Lex?

140
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,710
No. No, I don't know where she is,
but I can find out.

141
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,269
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.

142
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,238
We need to talk.

143
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,039
Lana warned us
her roommate was nosy.

144
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,475
You look worse than Lana.

145
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,796
So you're gonna go all Mrs. Brady
on me? Bring me some chicken soup?

146
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,396
No. I'm here because
I'm worried about my friend.

147
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,189
Lana's boyfriend just broke up with her.
She's really vulnerable and depressed.

148
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,433
The last thing she needs is to flunk out
of school because she's out partying.

149
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,632
- And you think it's your business?
- I know it's my business.

150
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,439
If you don't tell me
what you guys are taking all night...

151
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,670
<i>...I'll</i> make it
the university's business too.

152
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,115
Chill. Lana hasn't been <i>partying...</i>

153
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,431
<i>...and</i> she isn't moping around,
mourning her high-school sweetheart.

154
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,591
Well,
she isn't exactly acting like herself.

155
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,877
The two of you look like poster children
for the Betty Ford Clinic.

156
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,238
Look, I told you to let it go.
Now I'm done talking with you.

157
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,039
No. What is she taking? Drugs?

158
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,469
You're so small-minded.
No wonder Lana came to us.

159
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,834
Came to you for what?

160
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,393
That's between Lana
and her loved ones.

161
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,238
Alley, what is it? What's happening?

162
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,959
Near-death experience.

163
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,919
It's a compound, meteor rock.

164
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,195
Oh, my God.

165
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,312
I need an ambulance, please. It's an
emergency. At Poss House, room 1170.

166
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,914
Please, I don't wanna die.

167
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,152
Oh, God.

168
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,992
Lance?

169
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,518
- What are you doing?
- Getting rid of the evidence.

170
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,395
Evidence?

171
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,995
Alley, she's dead.

172
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,834
What? What happened to her?

173
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,154
I warned her there's only so many times
you could die before you stay that way.

174
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,594
Did your serum kill her?

175
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,316
My serum didn't do anything.
She did it to herself.

176
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,873
Well, I'm willing to take my chances.
I need you to send me back.

177
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,359
Are you out of your mind?

178
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,318
The police could be here any minute.
I gotta get out of here.

179
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,075
- Then we better hurry.
- What the hell is this?

180
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,637
Those are the keys to a very expensive
Porsche, parked outside.

181
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,837
Figured they'd cover the cost
for one more trip to the other side.

182
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,310
- You stole a Porsche?
- No. I borrowed it from a friend.

183
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,550
And he wants it back.

184
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,629
Lex.

185
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,476
Cool thing about expensive cars,
they all come with GPS tracking.

186
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,232
Lex, I can explain.

187
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,355
Lex? Lex Luthor?

188
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,310
Dumb bitch.
I never should have let you in on this.

189
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,277
- Lance, please wait.
- I'm out of here.

190
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,351
You're not going
till the authorities get...

191
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,754
Lana!

192
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,876
Say goodbye, jackass. I'm gone.

193
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,433
Mom?

194
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,433
I used to practice this for hours
when you were young.

195
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,397
Before Julian was born.

196
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,792
You'd sit next to me, quiet as a mouse.
Such a good little boy.

197
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,116
Never could get that part right.

198
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,839
I was injected with a hypodermic
full of some kind of chemical.

199
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,908
- I must have gone into shock and...
- Now you're dead.

200
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,675
This is just a delusion.

201
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,598
Like last time?

202
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,910
What was it then
that brought you to me?

203
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,798
Oh, yes.

204
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,349
You were shot after meeting
with the man you hired...

205
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,035
...to destroy
Jonathan Kent's <i>reputation...</i>

206
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,555
...so you could become senator.

207
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,194
How'd that turn out, by the way?

208
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,430
If you're my dead mother,
wouldn't you know?

209
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,996
It was a rhetorical question, Alexander.
Of course I know.

210
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,630
You ignored everything I showed you.

211
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,995
The life you could've had,
if only you had made a different choice.

212
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,915
And what choice is that?

213
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,232
You think the path you've chosen
isn't going to hurt? It will.

214
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,558
More than you can ever imagine.

215
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,555
You're not the only one
that's going to suffer.

216
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,751
Feel the beautiful flowers, laid barren
by an emptiness that can never be filled.

217
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,315
Unless I keep you here.

218
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,355
Stay with me, Alexander.

219
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,870
Don't let the blood wash away
what's left of your soul.

220
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,235
What are you talking about?
What blood?

221
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,153
Of all the people
you're going to murder.

222
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,074
No!

223
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,718
My God, this stuff's got a kick.

224
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,956
- What happened?
- I was looking for Lana...

225
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,348
...and I found your body.

226
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,149
I figured, if the green stuff killed you,
the other one would bring you back.

227
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,318
What? You were already dead.
I figured I'd take a chance.

228
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,875
- We have to help Lana.
- Lana was here?

229
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,749
Where is she, Lex?

230
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,471
Chloe, I got your message.
What happened?

231
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,914
- Lex died.
- What?

232
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,877
Don't worry,
I brought him back to life.

233
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,919
He said Lana's about to take a cruise
down the river Styx if we don't find her.

234
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,469
- Chloe, what's happening?
- You want the short story?

235
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,717
Lana and her friends have been
taking trips to the great beyond.

236
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,718
They're using a meteor-rock cocktail
to prolong their near-death experience.

237
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,752
But if we don't find her in <i>time...</i>

238
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,354
...she may never come back
from her next little jaunt.

239
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,355
So they kill themselves
and come back to life?

240
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,592
- Yeah.
- Why would Lana do something like that?

241
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,239
Because she's hurting, clark.

242
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,197
I mean,
she won't talk to you or to me.

243
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,352
Maybe she seeks comfort from
the people who care about her most.

244
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,875
The two people she knows
love her unconditionally.

245
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,638
- Her parents.
- Yes.

246
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,514
How are we gonna find her?

247
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,439
Well, thanks to Homeland Security...

248
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,388
...being on a college campus is akin
to wearing an electronic ankle bracelet.

249
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,630
A student ID can be tracked
anywhere, anytime.

250
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,396
All we have to do is find out where she's
been using it and hope she's still alive.

251
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,036
Figured I'd find a junkie
where needles are.

252
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,672
Let me help.

253
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,836
Tell Alley I said hi.

254
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,279
Lana, are you okay?

255
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,359
Clark, please help me.
I need them. I need them.

256
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,673
Lana.

257
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,310
Please. Clark!

258
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,159
Clark!

259
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,275
Do you know how much trouble
you caused me? You freshmen...

260
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,394
We need to help him.

261
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,157
Or choice B.

262
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,957
I take care of both of you.

263
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,829
Clark.

264
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,038
Clark.

265
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,713
Dad.

266
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,593
Hello, son.

267
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,271
I can't believe it's you.

268
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,429
You don't belong here, clark.
You have to go back.

269
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,791
Dad, you don't know
how hard it's been.

270
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,599
All I've done is hurt everyone
that's close to me.

271
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,557
That's not true, son.

272
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,515
You died because of me.

273
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,549
When Jor-El brought me back to life
and restored my powers...

274
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,391
<i>...he</i> told me there'd be a price:

275
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,116
The life of someone I love.

276
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,911
I'm sorry, Dad.

277
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,270
- I'm so sorry.
- Clark...

278
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,512
...believe me,
you have nothing to be sorry about.

279
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,188
I lived a... A full, wonderful life.

280
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,990
I had everything that a husband
or a... A father...

281
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,913
...could ever possibly dream of.

282
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,115
I am so very proud...

283
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,636
...that I died protecting you.

284
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,752
Protecting me from what?

285
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,876
Lionel Luthor, Clark.

286
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,633
He knows your secret.

287
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,911
He knows everything.

288
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,629
You can't stay here, son.

289
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,315
You've gotta keep your mother safe.

290
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,470
You've gotta keep the whole world safe.

291
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,914
- No, Dad.
- Clark...

292
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,275
Not without you. Dad, I need you.

293
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,793
I cannot do this without you.

294
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,831
Yes, you can.

295
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,715
This is your destiny, son.

296
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,437
You are going to touch the lives
of so many people.

297
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,837
Not just as a man, but as a...
As a symbol.

298
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,475
You're a symbol of peace.

299
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,110
You're a symbol of justice.

300
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,031
And now it's time for you to go.

301
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,314
<i>Clark.</i>

302
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,230
- No, not yet!
- I'll always be with you, son.

303
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,197
- <i>Clark!</i>
- Always.

304
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,118
Clark, please.

305
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,119
Clark!

306
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,359
Clark.

307
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,278
Mom?!

308
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,833
- Mom!
- Clark.

309
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,596
Just the man I was looking for.

310
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,399
What do you think?

311
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,596
You look amazing.

312
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,030
Well, if I can avoid dumping soup
in my lap in front of the governor...

313
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,596
No, you'll do great.

314
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,874
What's wrong?

315
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,754
Mom, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

316
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,633
He's early. I'm sorry.

317
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,554
Well, don't you look dashing.

318
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,110
Next to you, I'm a man in rags.

319
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,396
You should always wear that color,
Martha.

320
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,795
Doesn't she look beautiful, clark?

321
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,797
We'll talk tomorrow, sweetie.

322
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,108
- Your carriage awaits, senator.
- Good night, Clark.

323
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,791
Good night, Clark.

324
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,196
So apparently, actually dying neutralized
the kryptonite in your system.

325
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,839
- That's good to know.
- Yeah.

326
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,195
Although,
it's nothing I ever plan to try again.

327
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,679
Wise decision.

328
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,592
Did you find out about your professor?

329
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,358
Has Milton Fine been resurrected?

330
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,473
Fine was definitely in Honduras with
the black ship. I just don't know how.

331
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,116
Well, I'll reach out to my source
and see if they know anything else.

332
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,110
Don't worry, you won the first fight.
My money's on you in the rematch.

333
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,188
Fine's not the only thing
we need to worry about.

334
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,595
When I was injected with the serum
and died, I saw my father.

335
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,437
Oh, my God. Clark.

336
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,235
Yeah, he told me that there's
someone else who knows my secret.

337
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,119
Lionel Luthor.

338
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,191
Well, you can't be sure.
What you saw...

339
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,396
...it could have been a hallucination.

340
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,950
You know, a manifestation
of your desires and fears.

341
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,396
Chloe, I could feel my father.
It was real.

342
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,392
I know it in my heart.

343
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,792
Well, the source that led me to Fine
was Lionel.

344
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,670
- What? Why didn't you tell me?
- He made me promise to keep quiet...

345
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,311
...under the umbrella
of a reporter-source confidentiality.

346
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,755
He knew exactly how to play me.

347
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,669
He may be playing all of us.

348
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,317
It's beautiful.

349
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,518
It's my favorite.

350
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,633
- Lex...
- Is this gonna be another apology?

351
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,071
Well, they don't make a card for
"Sorry I got you killed."

352
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,637
You weren't yourself.

353
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,189
I know what that's like. Trust me.

354
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,874
I'm glad you're all right.

355
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,670
That I didn't end up like Alley.

356
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,756
I have to admit...

357
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,230
...crossing over
was a very enlightening experience.

358
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,197
What did you see?

359
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,394
My mother.

360
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,318
What'd she say?

361
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,237
She said that...

362
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,039
She's very proud
of the man I'm becoming.

363
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,753
She should be.

364
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,997
Clark, hi.

365
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,514
How you doing?

366
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,910
Well, to be honest,
I've felt a lot better.

367
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,874
I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna hurt anyone.

368
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,511
Except yourself.

369
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,158
No, that's...

370
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,112
I didn't want that, either.

371
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,756
Well, then, why were you doing it?

372
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,433
It wasn't because of us, clark.

373
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,999
It was...

374
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,753
Well, it was a lot of things.

375
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,317
I've felt alone for a very long <i>time...</i>

376
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,755
...even when I was around other people.

377
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,870
Even when I was with you.

378
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,591
I guess I just wanted
to feel their arms again.

379
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,157
Feel their warmth.

380
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,639
Did you?

381
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,277
Almost.

382
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,236
But it'll have to do.

383
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,317
Because I won't let myself
be that dependent again.

384
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,793
No matter what I'm searching for.

385
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,712
I hope so.

386
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,873
Lana?

387
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,914
All I want is for you to be happy.

388
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,391
I will be.

389
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,831
