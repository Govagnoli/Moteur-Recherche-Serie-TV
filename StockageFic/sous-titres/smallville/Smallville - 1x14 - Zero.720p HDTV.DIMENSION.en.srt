1
00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:07,509
The world moves so fast today.

2
00:00:09,334 --> 00:00:12,711
People forget how much
better they had it as kids...

3
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:16,601
when hours seemed like days

4
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:20,000
and a favorite toy could
be a child's best friend.

5
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,133
Toys are powerful things, you know.

6
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:34,230
They are vessels for the
imagination imbued with life...

7
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:39,634
through the simple act of play.

8
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:52,000
Mercer is taking too many risks.

9
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:54,883
Lex took a gamble with
her, and it's paying off.

10
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:57,501
Look at the success she's
had with the Daily Planet.

11
00:00:57,621 --> 00:01:00,399
Lex didn't know she was funneling
all of Luthorcorp's holdings

12
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:05,057
into one highly experimental bioweapon.
And now she's lost the prototype.

13
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:08,200
I move for a vote of no confidence.

14
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:11,080
- Yeah, I second the motion.
- All those in favor of making a change.

15
00:01:11,677 --> 00:01:13,234
Aye.

16
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:15,334
That is, I agree it's time for a change,

17
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,701
but not quite how you mean it.

18
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:21,234
Oliver Quenn. What are
you doing in enemy camp?

19
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:24,167
I'm actually the one
who called this meeting.

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,701
Tess sends her regrets. But

21
00:01:26,398 --> 00:01:30,188
she's on her way to dubai, overseeing
some of our international interests.

22
00:01:30,308 --> 00:01:32,033
What do you mean "our"?

23
00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:35,840
With Tess' cooperation,

24
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,834
I've purchased controlling
interest in Luthorcorp.

25
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:45,739
If that barracuda went behind our backs
and helped you with a hostile takeover...

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,848
you know, I really don't think that the Luthorcorp
board should be lecturing me on ethics, ma'am.

27
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:54,414
After all, you've been using the world as
your own personal playground for way too long.

28
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:57,100
The world is much better
off because of the Luthors,

29
00:01:57,133 --> 00:02:00,200
and no pampered playboy is
going to destroy their legacy.

30
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:06,400
Everybody down!

31
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:18,968
Smallville 814

32
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:29,100
Synchro : Flolo

33
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:00,767
For seriessub.com

34
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:14,522
please tell me that the
bed was already wobbly.

35
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:16,133
Lana, it's made of solid oak.

36
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:18,739
Oh, god.

37
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:27,000
What do you say we find
out how strong the floor is?

38
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:29,367
Where do you get all the energy?

39
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:33,167
How would you like
to see another sunset?

40
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,767
We could start our night all over again.

41
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:38,834
Head west, find a sandy beach.

42
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:44,066
I love you being so romantic, Clark.

43
00:03:44,186 --> 00:03:48,419
But there's something that I would love
even more than a trip to the tropics.

44
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:51,746
Just ask, and it's yours.

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,352
I want to help you when you're
out patrolling Metropolis.

46
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:06,244
Lana, I'm not so sure that ...

47
00:04:06,364 --> 00:04:08,579
when I stopped that bullet
and saved dr. Groll's life,

48
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:11,868
it was the most amazing
feeling I have ever had.

49
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:15,133
I got to use my new powers
the way I always planned to.

50
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:17,667
Lana, even with your strength and speed,

51
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:20,142
it's still dangerous out there.

52
00:04:20,703 --> 00:04:23,934
You've protected me for years.

53
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:26,267
But this is who I am now.

54
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,402
It's the life I want.

55
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:32,496
And I want to share it with you.

56
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:46,543
All I've ever wanted was
someone to share my life with.

57
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,654
To work with me, side by side...

58
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:55,461
just like my mom and dad did.

59
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,299
- With my abilities, I never thought...
- Clark, stop.

60
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,945
I'm right here.

61
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,774
Hey. There was some sort of
an explosion at Luthorcorp.

62
00:05:23,774 --> 00:05:25,465
The news was saying it was a bomb.

63
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:27,400
- Oh, my god.
- Was anyone hurt?

64
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:30,031
Apparently, everyone on the
board of directors was killed.

65
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:33,044
Oliver was there. He's in the hospital.

66
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:12,968
Well, if it isn't Metropolis'
newest power couple.

67
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,791
How you doing, Oliver?

68
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:18,164
I'm all right. Nothing
a dry martini can't cure.

69
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:22,033
Were there any other survivors?

70
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:24,451
You were the only one.

71
00:06:24,571 --> 00:06:27,067
They said the table
protected you from the blast.

72
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,400
Oliver, do you have
any idea who did this?

73
00:06:30,868 --> 00:06:32,733
Angry shareholder, maybe?

74
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:35,898
I just bought a controlling
stake in Luthorcorp.

75
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:38,747
I was meeting with the
board to announce it.

76
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:41,534
If you're trying to erase
the "Luthor" from Luthorcorp,

77
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,534
then there's one obvious choice
for who was behind this attack.

78
00:06:48,318 --> 00:06:52,057
You know, if he was gonna come after
anyone, Lana, I would assume it would be you.

79
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:54,701
You were the one that
really got under his skin.

80
00:06:55,442 --> 00:07:00,192
Or should I say into it. That biotech that
you commandeered, that was his lifeline.

81
00:07:00,312 --> 00:07:02,822
It was his last chance at recovery.

82
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:05,903
Thing probably meant more to
him than his entire company.

83
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,133
Do you remember anything
before the blast?

84
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:12,653
Something that could help us
figure out if Lex is behind this?

85
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,300
No.

86
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:19,534
No, I didn't see anything.

87
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,590
All right. Don't worry, Oliver.

88
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,364
I promise we're gonna
find out who did this.

89
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:56,852
Oliver's lucky to be alive.

90
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:04,067
Looks like the bomb went off over here.

91
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:08,400
Must be pieces in the walls everywhere.

92
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:12,711
Clark. Are you okay?

93
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:15,608
There's kryptonite.

94
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,934
Looks like this silver shard
was part of the bomb, but...

95
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:32,755
why would they use meteor rock?

96
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:36,388
It's not the first time it's been
used to make a bomb more powerful.

97
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:41,356
What was that?

98
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:45,434
Whatever it was, Lana, I don't
feel the kryptonite anymore.

99
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:49,260
Maybe it was treated with something that
lost its charge when I moved the chip.

100
00:08:52,868 --> 00:08:54,868
Quenn industries.

101
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:58,251
Clark, I think that Oliver
knows more than he's saying.

102
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,103
Lana, it's a big company. They
make thousands of chips a year.

103
00:09:01,223 --> 00:09:03,334
Why would you think Oliver
would be responsible?

104
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:07,200
I don't, but doesn't it seem
like he's covering something?

105
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:09,801
But why would he hide anything from me?

106
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:12,191
He's done it before, Clark.

107
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,620
When I tracked Lex to
cuba, Oliver showed up.

108
00:09:17,901 --> 00:09:20,234
He was there to kill Lex.

109
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,434
Why didn't you tell me about this?

110
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:27,929
I thought that I'd talked him down,

111
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:30,814
but obviously, he still
has his own agenda.

112
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:36,148
I think that you should show him the
chip and give him a chance to explain.

113
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:37,982
No, we can't trust him anymore.

114
00:09:38,102 --> 00:09:41,346
If he's so obsessed with killing
Lex that he went behind my back,

115
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:43,488
i don't want to pull him in any deeper.

116
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,749
Whatever Oliver is hiding,
we'll figure it out on our own.

117
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:57,634
The game has begun.

118
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:06,095
Although, even the finest plan
can't guarantee a flawless execution.

119
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:15,144
Apparently...

120
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,484
miss Mercer wasn't in the room.

121
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,778
And Oliver Quenn survived.

122
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,901
But don't you worry.

123
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:32,452
I'll be sure to tie up
any loose ends, mr. Luthor.

124
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:39,744
Meanwhile, we've
already begun round two.

125
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:46,701
Time for our next move.

126
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,471
Your heart rate's a little
higher than normal, mr. Quenn.

127
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:23,164
Really?

128
00:11:23,164 --> 00:11:26,771
I'm sure the view has that
effect on all your patients.

129
00:11:27,883 --> 00:11:30,167
Well, with the pain meds you're on,

130
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:34,334
I'm afraid this is the only
view you're getting tonight.

131
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:35,730
Rest.

132
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:40,533
Looks like someone's
making a speedy recovery.

133
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,301
Yeah, not quick enough. Trust me.

134
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,896
Well, I'm guessing you didn't get me
over here to spoon you chicken soup.

135
00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:50,380
No. Listen, I need you to pull an
address off of Quenn industries' database.

136
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,081
It's an engineer that I fired six
years ago. His name's winslow schott.

137
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:57,101
And you think this
ex-employee is behind the bomb?

138
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,867
I hired him right out of m.i.t.

139
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,062
Developed explosives ... anything from

140
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:03,700
blowing out tunnels to
breaking up kidney stones.

141
00:12:03,734 --> 00:12:07,346
That's pretty high praise for
someone you handed a pink slip to.

142
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:10,770
- What happened? -
High-pressure job.

143
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,468
He snapped.

144
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,301
He started bringing toys to work.

145
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,600
Whatever, right?

146
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:20,392
But then he started...

147
00:12:20,512 --> 00:12:23,767
hiding explosives inside the toys.

148
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,533
And that's when I realized
winslow was thinking

149
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:29,001
a little bit too far
outside the toy box.

150
00:12:31,173 --> 00:12:33,401
Why are you telling
me this when you have

151
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:35,867
your very own personal bomb
squad in Clark and Lana?

152
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,959
Look, give me 10 minutes with one of your
satellites, and I'll get them to go and get him.

153
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,468
No, Chloe, we can't tell Clark.

154
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:49,447
Winslow could have attacked me any
time he wanted in the past six years.

155
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:52,517
He chose the night I took
over Luthorcorp to do it.

156
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:55,612
The toy boy may have pulled the pin...

157
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:58,600
but I think he's working for Lex.

158
00:12:59,224 --> 00:13:02,767
So, you're not actually interested
in tracking this winslow guy down.

159
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:05,067
You just want him to lead you to Lex.

160
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:10,800
And you want Clark to
stay out of your way.

161
00:13:11,962 --> 00:13:13,967
Chloe, you know Clark would never agree

162
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,583
to do what needs to be done
to get rid of Lex forever.

163
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,234
You're talking about killing a man.

164
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:26,127
I'm talking about ending this reign of
terror that's been consuming us all lately.

165
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:30,101
No. I can't lie to Clark.

166
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:32,859
You want to tell him the truth,
or you want to protect him?

167
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,101
Lex tried to kill me. You know
he's coming after Clark next.

168
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:40,867
Chloe, he knows his secret.

169
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,600
Could you honestly live with yourself
if you let something happen to Clark?

170
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:06,334
What are you doing here?

171
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:09,134
You know Oliver.

172
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:12,251
Even the blast of a bomb
won't rattle his work ethic.

173
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:15,970
He asked me to come in and pull some
of the files from the Luthorcorp deal.

174
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,195
That's funny.

175
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,388
Because I would think that Quenn industries
could free up at least one employee

176
00:14:21,508 --> 00:14:23,219
to run his errands for him.

177
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,234
Yeah, well, I'm not exactly
a brink's security truck,

178
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:28,434
but Oliver knows he can trust me.

179
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,543
I thought I could, too.

180
00:14:33,134 --> 00:14:36,202
You're chasing down a lead on
the bombing for him, aren't you?

181
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,880
Sorry, Clark.

182
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,034
Chloe, you don't understand.

183
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:45,800
Lana told me about Oliver's
vendetta against Lex.

184
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:47,896
He knows that I would try to stop him.

185
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:49,866
That's why he would lie, but
i don't know why you would.

186
00:14:49,986 --> 00:14:52,428
Because I don't want to lose you, Clark.

187
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:56,900
Lex knows that the meteor rocks
are poisonous to kryptonians.

188
00:14:56,934 --> 00:14:59,700
He knows your weakness.
He could kill you.

189
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:02,434
That doesn't mean I'm supposed
to kill him first, Chloe.

190
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,594
No matter what Oliver said to you, Lex
and I are not in a battle to the death.

191
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:07,867
Open your eyes, Clark.

192
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,734
Lex declared war on you years ago.
He's known your secret for months.

193
00:15:11,854 --> 00:15:15,281
- Why have you not done anything yet?
- I'm focused on the future ...

194
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:17,934
on using my abilities to help people.

195
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,360
I don't want to live in the past.

196
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,500
But that's exactly what you're doing.

197
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:28,044
You think that Lex is still that same man
you saved on the bridge eight years ago?

198
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:31,401
You're not recognizing
the monster he's become.

199
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:34,332
So because I'm not gonna
kill someone, I'm in denial?

200
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,767
When you were taken over by brainiac,

201
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,220
you could have destroyed
the world, Chloe.

202
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:43,368
But I refused to kill you.

203
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:54,555
Here.

204
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:58,401
It's Oliver's top suspect
... winslow schott.

205
00:15:58,434 --> 00:16:00,612
He used to work at s.t.a.r. Labs.

206
00:16:03,034 --> 00:16:05,949
Oliver thinks he would lead us to Lex.

207
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,900
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

208
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:36,741
Can I help you?

209
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,738
I certainly hope so.

210
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:42,195
Could you direct me to Oliver Quenn's
room? I have a delivery for him.

211
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:05,539
You found your necklace.

212
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:08,481
After all the pain I caused you,
I'm surprised you still have it.

213
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,991
How could I throw away
something that means so much?

214
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:20,085
I still remember seeing you
wear this in high school.

215
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:24,593
I couldn't get within 5 feet
of you without falling over.

216
00:17:24,713 --> 00:17:27,540
And even after your ship
got rid of the kryptonite,

217
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,649
there always seemed to be
something standing in our way.

218
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:34,031
Not anymore.

219
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:37,234
We're together now, Lana.

220
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:40,612
And I'm not gonna let anyone
take that away from us.

221
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,341
Clark, I talked to dr. Groll about
what happened with the kryptonite.

222
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,034
It wasn't the chip.

223
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,607
It was me.

224
00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:58,467
So, besides strength and speed,
you can destroy kryptonite.

225
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:02,780
No Groll says I absorbed
it. But I'm worried, Clark.

226
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:08,267
If Lex built this as a weapon,
what if you were the target?

227
00:18:09,134 --> 00:18:12,534
But Lex isn't wearing
it, Lana ...  you are.

228
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:14,641
Look, we're gonna figure this out.

229
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:19,060
But we need to stay focused on tracking down
this bomber before he causes any more damage.

230
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:22,735
Did you find anything?

231
00:18:22,855 --> 00:18:24,167
Yeah.

232
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:29,530
You were right ... Oliver
was hiding something.

233
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,134
He thinks the bomber is someone
who used to work for him.

234
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,627
I went to that address listed there,
but he doesn't live there anymore.

235
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:42,247
According to this, mr. Schott
is a pretty prolific inventor.

236
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:45,568
He filed a lot of
patents for s.t.a.r. Labs.

237
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:49,832
A guy like this, he wouldn't
just stop registering his research

238
00:18:49,952 --> 00:18:51,491
because Oliver let him go.

239
00:18:51,611 --> 00:18:54,434
So maybe the patent office
has a current address for him.

240
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:58,514
If this guy's working for Lex, we're dealing
with a lot more than just some toy maker.

241
00:18:58,634 --> 00:19:02,546
If Lex put things in motion, he
has planned three moves ahead.

242
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:05,800
And now that he has nothing to lose,

243
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,234
he's more dangerous than ever.

244
00:19:24,082 --> 00:19:25,913
What the hell?

245
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:29,301
How does it feel to not
be in control for once?

246
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,334
Untie me right now.

247
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:36,477
That wouldn't be very much fun.

248
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:45,772
I get it. I get it.

249
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:48,811
The children's ward's
two floors up, you know.

250
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:52,788
-  Excuse me?
- The balloons, the monkey,

251
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:55,564
the ridiculous costume you're
wearing ... you're a clown, right?

252
00:19:55,684 --> 00:19:57,284
Aren't you a clown?

253
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,194
I am winslow schott.

254
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:08,274
You called me one of s.t.a.r. Labs'
greatest minds, and then you fired me.

255
00:20:09,934 --> 00:20:11,934
Winslow.

256
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:15,568
Of course, yeah. Yeah,
i remember you now.

257
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:18,795
Well, it's good to see you're
still playing with toys.

258
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:21,201
Come on, man.

259
00:20:21,234 --> 00:20:23,350
How much for the ape?

260
00:20:28,668 --> 00:20:31,606
I don't need your money
anymore, mr. Quenn.

261
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:35,601
I found someone new to work with...

262
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,624
someone who appreciates my genius.

263
00:20:40,434 --> 00:20:43,900
None other than Lex Luthor himself.

264
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:47,234
Well, that's impressive.

265
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:49,465
I thought he was dead.

266
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:53,628
You are the one who's
supposed to be dead.

267
00:20:53,748 --> 00:20:57,115
You should have died in that
explosion, like everyone else!

268
00:20:57,235 --> 00:21:01,168
You seem like you're getting angry, winslow.
Maybe you should take your toys and go home.

269
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:04,422
Actually...

270
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,501
...i made a toy just for you.

271
00:21:16,814 --> 00:21:20,968
After this little fella Langs
his cymbals together 53 times...

272
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:24,847
it'll be the last sound you ever hear.

273
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:27,617
53, huh?

274
00:21:29,193 --> 00:21:31,900
Seems a little arbitrary, doesn't it?

275
00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:35,134
I filed 53 patents working for you.

276
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:38,780
Quenn industries made
millions, and I got nothing.

277
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,601
I bet you wish you
appreciated my artistry

278
00:21:49,634 --> 00:21:52,385
just a little bit more now, don't you?

279
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:57,740
Unlock the other cuff.

280
00:21:58,182 --> 00:22:02,207
Come on! 28 and counting! Bobo's
not gonna slow down any time soon.

281
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:13,862
I swear, I'll break every one
of your artistic little fingers.

282
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:17,111
Now, tell me ... where can I find Lex?

283
00:22:29,201 --> 00:22:32,514
This is the last known address
the patent office had for him.

284
00:22:33,016 --> 00:22:35,808
Chloe mentioned this winslow
guy had a thing for toys.

285
00:22:35,928 --> 00:22:38,202
I'm guessing he still lives here.

286
00:22:50,634 --> 00:22:53,601
There's a wireless
camera inside this doll.

287
00:22:56,467 --> 00:22:59,780
- Someone's watching us.
- I can guess who it is.

288
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,134
Lex likes to keep an eye on
the people that work for him.

289
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:13,700
Lana, look at this.

290
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:19,167
It's Metropolis.

291
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:22,886
Winslow must have played out the
bombing here before the attack.

292
00:23:23,006 --> 00:23:26,178
If that's the case, then daily
planet is Lex's next target.

293
00:23:34,634 --> 00:23:36,733
Excuse me, mr. Quenn?

294
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:39,501
It's time for your medicine.

295
00:23:42,934 --> 00:23:45,038
Oh, my god!

296
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:48,267
Where's mr. Quenn?

297
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,832
Just delivered a balloon-o-gram,
and the guy attacked me.

298
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:53,601
Here. Let me help you.

299
00:23:53,634 --> 00:23:56,134
Thank you. Thank you so much.

300
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:57,934
You.

301
00:23:57,967 --> 00:24:01,205
You're winslow schott!
No, don't untie him!

302
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:19,100
I win.

303
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,041
I just picked Chloe up from
the hospital. She's okay.

304
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:33,997
But this Toyman guy got away.

305
00:24:34,117 --> 00:24:36,025
Keep looking, Lana.

306
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:41,267
Call me crazy, Clark, but isn't
there a bomb you should be finding?

307
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:44,134
Chasing that camera's signal may
be our only chance to find Lex.

308
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:46,734
And Lana's already searching
foror the bomb at the Daily Planet.

309
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:48,089
Have you had any luck?

310
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:52,480
The feed to the camera's been cut, but it was
definitely broadcasting to a single receiver.

311
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,267
You found Lex.

312
00:24:54,301 --> 00:24:57,553
Well, I managed to sneak past
the latest gaggle of ghost routers

313
00:24:57,673 --> 00:25:00,217
and ping the original i.p. Address
that winslow was sending to.

314
00:25:00,337 --> 00:25:01,651
Where is he?

315
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:04,023
"Where" sort of depends
on "when," Clark.

316
00:25:04,143 --> 00:25:06,697
Lex has been on the
move this whole time.

317
00:25:07,116 --> 00:25:09,201
I thought Lex was immobilized.

318
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:10,867
Lex may have been immobilized,

319
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:16,014
but his i.p. Address is still leaping
tall wireless towers in a single bound.

320
00:25:16,134 --> 00:25:19,600
Now, I programmed the signal
into one of Oliver's satellites

321
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:21,533
and synched it with my pda.

322
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:23,923
I made you a Lex tracker.

323
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:27,955
Now, Oliver's satellite is
about to pass out of range.

324
00:25:28,075 --> 00:25:31,665
You only have 10 minutes before the
signal is gone and Lex disappears again.

325
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:42,480
Clark, I searched every room, and
i can't find the bomb anywhere.

326
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,533
Like you said, we're a team.

327
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:04,507
It's on the roof.

328
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:31,101
Clark, that much kryptonite
could take out half the city.

329
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:38,380
Clark Kent and Lana Lang,
welcome to your destiny.

330
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,397
You've destroyed me in every way,

331
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:46,186
so now I'm going to take
away what matters most to you.

332
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:53,918
Do you know what people remember about
the greatest star-crossed romances?

333
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:56,334
Not how the lovers met,

334
00:26:56,368 --> 00:26:59,860
but the way the
relationship tragically ends.

335
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:06,143
The skin Lana's wearing was
designed to absorb enough meteor rock

336
00:27:06,263 --> 00:27:09,577
that you'll never be
able to go near her again.

337
00:27:10,491 --> 00:27:12,800
You're a coward, Lex.

338
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:14,719
Come out here. Face us!

339
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,403
No, Clark.

340
00:27:16,523 --> 00:27:19,624
It's time for you to
face your defining moment.

341
00:27:19,744 --> 00:27:21,621
You can walk away,

342
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:24,877
sacrificing innocent
lives to stay together,

343
00:27:24,997 --> 00:27:29,874
or defuse the bomb and
sacrifice your love forever.

344
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,668
You have to.

345
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:49,706
You'll never hurt
anyone else ever again.

346
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:58,401
I know how much it
hurts right now, Clark,

347
00:29:58,434 --> 00:30:01,667
but if you go after Lex
like this, you will kill him.

348
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,434
After what he's done to us,
Lana, he needs to be stopped.

349
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:12,073
I promise you... I will
help you to punish Lex.

350
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:17,234
But if you kill him,

351
00:30:17,267 --> 00:30:21,134
you will lose so much more
than just us being together.

352
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:28,134
You'll lose yourself.

353
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:27,334
Lex deserved to die, Chloe.

354
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:33,100
You certainly made sure
he got what he deserved.

355
00:31:33,134 --> 00:31:35,801
They identified the remains as Lex's.

356
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:40,234
And what does Clark think?

357
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,367
That winslow turned on Lex.

358
00:31:44,401 --> 00:31:47,868
Pieces of a toy bomb were
found in the wreckage.

359
00:31:56,234 --> 00:31:58,701
Yeah, well, that makes sense.

360
00:31:58,734 --> 00:32:01,467
Wouldn't be like winslow
to play a game he can't win.

361
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:06,549
Are you seriously gonna let another man

362
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:09,364
take the blame for something you did?

363
00:32:10,501 --> 00:32:13,848
Chloe, winslow was already a killer.

364
00:32:13,968 --> 00:32:16,593
He blew up all those
people at Luthorcorp.

365
00:32:16,713 --> 00:32:20,067
He was about ready to take
down the entire Daily Planet.

366
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,483
One more death's not
gonna make a difference.

367
00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:25,100
Are you listening to yourself?

368
00:32:25,134 --> 00:32:27,283
Oliver, you've really
crossed a line here.

369
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,967
Lex is dead.

370
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,996
The world is safer because
of it. Clark is safe again.

371
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,634
This is murder.

372
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:35,644
This is justice.

373
00:32:35,911 --> 00:32:38,467
Although Clark may not
be able to accept that,

374
00:32:38,501 --> 00:32:41,367
you know what I did was right.

375
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:48,088
And please don't stand
there and look so innocent.

376
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:51,967
You know, I did a little
video viewing of my own.

377
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,575
Seems a certain meteor
freak named sebastian kane

378
00:32:55,695 --> 00:32:59,152
died at the hospital
right after he got a visit

379
00:32:59,272 --> 00:33:01,771
from somebody who looked
an awful lot like you.

380
00:33:04,267 --> 00:33:07,670
That was brainiac... not me.

381
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:09,775
Was it?

382
00:33:11,967 --> 00:33:15,491
Because it seemed like a pretty
natural instinct to protect Clark.

383
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:21,658
Now that Lex is gone...

384
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:25,029
you can't tell me you're not relieved.

385
00:33:31,334 --> 00:33:35,449
Ever fiber of my conscience
wants to say that's not true.

386
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:38,196
- But...
- then...

387
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:42,234
you can't tell Clark what I did.

388
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:49,448
Lex just ripped the
man's heart out, Chloe.

389
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:53,500
He's gonna need his friends around
him right now more than ever.

390
00:36:58,264 --> 00:37:00,445
Clark, please.

391
00:37:00,565 --> 00:37:02,727
I don't want to hurt you.

392
00:37:05,801 --> 00:37:08,401
Lex already took care of that.

393
00:37:14,554 --> 00:37:16,799
Did you talk to dr. Groll?

394
00:37:18,691 --> 00:37:20,698
Can he help us?

395
00:37:24,597 --> 00:37:25,868
No.

396
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:37,098
I'm gonna do everything
i can to fix this, Lana.

397
00:37:37,218 --> 00:37:39,997
I will find a way for us to be together.

398
00:37:40,516 --> 00:37:42,765
Clark, he tried everything.

399
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,333
He can't reverse the process.

400
00:37:55,078 --> 00:37:56,776
I love you.

401
00:37:58,183 --> 00:38:00,064
I always will.

402
00:38:02,023 --> 00:38:05,068
I know what I need to
do with my life now.

403
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:09,801
Life is...

404
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:12,334
so precious...

405
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:14,868
so beautiful.

406
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,964
And to be able to protect
that, that's an amazing gift.

407
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:23,206
I know you feel the same way.

408
00:38:26,074 --> 00:38:28,502
What we have is beautiful.

409
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:35,367
Clark, we made our choice on that roof.

410
00:38:35,401 --> 00:38:38,067
And I know we would do it again.

411
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,464
Because both of us are driven to do
this, even if we can't do it together.

412
00:38:43,734 --> 00:38:45,634
Don't leave.

413
00:38:46,305 --> 00:38:48,466
Don't leave again, Lana.

414
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:55,381
Even if we can't be together,
i want you in my life.

415
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,567
That's where you're stronger than me.

416
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:02,370
To...

417
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,601
to see you...

418
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:07,772
on the street every day...

419
00:39:08,067 --> 00:39:11,308
and not be able to touch you...

420
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,684
stay.

421
00:39:14,804 --> 00:39:16,734
No.

422
00:39:20,868 --> 00:39:23,024
Clark, don't.

423
00:40:17,801 --> 00:40:20,295
Goodbye, Clark.

424
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:37,400
That night at the cemetery, when
i introduced you to my mom and dad,

425
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,768
you told me that i
would never be alone...

426
00:40:40,801 --> 00:40:44,006
that my mom would always
be watching over me.

427
00:40:44,595 --> 00:40:48,109
If we're in each other's hearts, Clark,

428
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:51,014
i will always be with you.

429
00:40:52,734 --> 00:40:55,167
No matter what.

430
00:40:58,434 --> 00:41:00,467
I love you.

431
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:29,434
I love you.
