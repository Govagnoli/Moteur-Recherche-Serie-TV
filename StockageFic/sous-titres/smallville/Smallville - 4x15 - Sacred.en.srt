1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,441
Decision, Clark.

2
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:07,273
They are on the top of my to do list.

3
00:00:07,302 --> 00:00:10,170
With lois out of town,
you don't have any excuses.

4
00:00:10,195 --> 00:00:13,345
These college application deadlines
are coming up soon, clark.

5
00:00:13,364 --> 00:00:15,714
I know how hard it was giving up
those football scholarships,

6
00:00:15,742 --> 00:00:19,151
but we have to start making
some decisions about your future.

7
00:00:21,462 --> 00:00:22,615
I'll get it.

8
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:27,993
Clark kent?

9
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,023
Yes.

10
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:30,256
Sign here.

11
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:38,325
What is it?

12
00:00:40,393 --> 00:00:42,203
It's from dr. Swann.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,276
Clark, martha.

14
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:46,344
I think you should see this.

15
00:00:48,473 --> 00:00:50,334
We have breaking news from new york.

16
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:53,343
Here is our correspondent ron florence.

17
00:00:53,592 --> 00:00:54,972
Thank you, Carla.

18
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,842
We've just confirmed that dr. Virgil
swann passed away this morning.

19
00:00:59,962 --> 00:01:02,856
No details are being released.

20
00:01:02,905 --> 00:01:08,512
The reclusive billionaire will be remembered as one
of the leading philanthropists of his generation.

21
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,999
Along with starting the virgil
swann charitable foundation,

22
00:01:12,046 --> 00:01:15,028
I don't understand.
I just talked to him last week.

23
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,635
I'm sorry, clark.

24
00:01:17,752 --> 00:01:19,337
I truly am.

25
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:20,932
We both are.

26
00:01:22,388 --> 00:01:26,791
There was still so much I needed to
learn from him about krypton and jor-el.

27
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:30,710
We can be thankful for everything
he did pass on to you.

28
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:50,548
"Kal-el, I wish I could
continue this journey with you.

29
00:01:51,522 --> 00:01:54,105
But now you must seek out your father.

30
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,954
If I sheltered you from him
for too long, forgive me.

31
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:00,431
Jor-el sent you here on a mission.

32
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:04,111
He's the only one
who can help you finish it.

33
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:08,174
I am returning something
that is rightfully yours.

34
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:11,286
I know it will lead you
to your destiny. "

35
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:39,302
...searching for intelligent
life in the universe.

36
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:43,153
The world will remember
his many contributions,

37
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:46,184
and men will benefit
from his gifts

38
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:48,121
for generations to come.

39
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,560
I knew you would return, my son.

40
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:28,383
Why did you send me to find this?

41
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:32,598
Because you may be the last
survivor of a great civilization.

42
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:35,545
A great civilization
that destroyed itself!

43
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,558
As will yours, if you continue
to refuse your mission.

44
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:43,409
The knowledge of our civilization
was encoded in three stones

45
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:47,202
brought to earth and hidden
at the far reaches of the world.

46
00:03:47,484 --> 00:03:50,314
Greed will drive others
to hunt the stones.

47
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:53,496
But if the humans should
unite them before you,

48
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:56,466
they will not be able
to withstand the temptation

49
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:59,669
and will drive the world
to famine, war,

50
00:03:59,704 --> 00:04:02,053
and the earth's
ultimate destruction.

51
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,295
You must find
the other two stones.

52
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:07,336
The fate of the world
lies in your hands...

53
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,900
kal-el.

58
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:11,972
- Hello?
- Hey, it's jason.

59
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:13,801
Jason who?

60
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:15,386
Very funny.

61
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:18,345
Well, it doesn't sound like kansas.
Where are you?

62
00:05:19,296 --> 00:05:20,632
Uh, metropolis.

63
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:23,603
I have to stay here for a few days,
oversee some things for lex.

64
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:26,266
I didn't realize that your job
required any overseeing.

65
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:29,647
Yeah. Listen, I can't really talk right now.
I just stepped out of a meeting, but I...

66
00:05:29,683 --> 00:05:32,841
wanted to call 'cause
I didn't get a chance to before I left.

67
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:35,440
Is lex with you?

68
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:36,908
No, I'm solo.

69
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:38,634
Well, you'd better stay that way.

70
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:41,358
I know what happens to people
when they run off to metropolis.

71
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:46,686
What was that?

72
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:48,894
Nothing. Um,

73
00:05:48,926 --> 00:05:51,956
listen, I've gotta go. I'll call you
tomorrow, okay? Good night.

74
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:56,759
Good night.

75
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:16,585
Hello.

76
00:06:16,773 --> 00:06:19,532
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you skipped out on me.

77
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:20,460
Lex.

78
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:24,346
Yeah, uh... I was going to call you. Something
came up. I had to leave work early.

79
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:27,044
To what, catch the next flight to shanghai?

80
00:06:27,725 --> 00:06:28,441
What?

81
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:30,696
Why don't you turn around?

82
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:40,675
You didn't really think I'd hire you, bring you into
my life, and not follow every step you take, did you?

83
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,310
Lex...

84
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:43,563
I know my father
gave you a map, jason,

85
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:46,842
and I know you've figured out that
it leads to a temple just outside the city,

86
00:06:46,877 --> 00:06:50,957
but if you think you're gonna find that
stone without me... you're mistaken.

87
00:06:55,118 --> 00:06:56,128
Let's go.

88
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:09,654
I thought we agreed that you would
not go back down into the caves.

89
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:11,625
Dad, I couldn't just
ignore swann's message.

90
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,386
I know that you trust him, but...

91
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:15,922
clark he doesn't know jor-el
the way we do.

92
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:17,973
Dad, it's not like I've forgotten
who we're dealing with here.

93
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:20,427
I'm just afraid of what's going to happen
if we continue to ignore him.

94
00:07:20,475 --> 00:07:23,559
Listen, I realize that he's your
birth father, all right, but he...

95
00:07:23,594 --> 00:07:25,923
he's never had your
best interests at heart.

96
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:28,713
Maybe, but he's never lied to me, either.
And the trials that he's put me through...

97
00:07:28,737 --> 00:07:31,942
maybe they're not all random. Maybe he's
trying to prepare me to find these stones.

98
00:07:31,977 --> 00:07:34,981
Are you really sure you want
to open all this up again?

99
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:38,374
The last few months, ever since
you walked away from jor-el,

100
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,863
it's like we got the old clark back.

101
00:07:42,177 --> 00:07:46,603
Well, mom, as much as I like playing football
and trying to be normal, the truth is, I'm not.

102
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:48,447
We all know that.

103
00:07:50,548 --> 00:07:53,483
Look, I've already let one of these
stones slip through my hands.

104
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:58,379
Even if you were to find the stones...
son, we have no idea what's gonna happen

105
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:00,622
- if you bring 'em all together.
- I know, dad.

106
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:05,086
But if I don't find them,
someone else will.

107
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:17,727
Miss lang.

108
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:21,473
Please, don't be shy.

109
00:08:21,754 --> 00:08:26,034
You are looking for your elusive
boyfriend, I assume.

110
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:30,249
Uh, yeah, I was hoping that lex
could get in touch with him for me.

111
00:08:30,296 --> 00:08:34,288
He sent him to go catch up on this project,
and I can't seem to reach him on his cell.

112
00:08:34,324 --> 00:08:38,706
Well, I would imagine the reception
would be rather shoddy in china.

113
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:44,389
Lex is in shanghai. If I had to guess, I would
say that your boyfriend is there with him.

114
00:08:46,303 --> 00:08:49,853
I'm sorry, I thought jason would've
told you what's happening...

115
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:54,186
considering you are the one
born right into the middle of all this.

116
00:08:54,609 --> 00:09:00,664
You should know, miss lang, how thoroughly lex and jason have been studying isabelle theroux, your...

117
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:03,106
your rebellious ancestor.

118
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:06,499
Looks like they aren't the only ones.

119
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:14,248
Isabelle's arch rival was... a duchess

120
00:09:14,565 --> 00:09:16,421
gertrude who was...

121
00:09:16,585 --> 00:09:20,156
obsessed with finding
three mythical stones.

122
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:26,238
She sent ships to the far ends
of the known earth, but all her agents

123
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:28,105
could discover

124
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,831
was this map...

125
00:09:29,878 --> 00:09:31,745
somewhere in china.

126
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:35,961
Well, what does this treasure map
have to do with isabelle?

127
00:09:35,996 --> 00:09:39,002
The map never made it
into the hands of the duchess.

128
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,078
Isabelle stole the document and hid it.

129
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:47,377
Gertrude had the exquisite
young sorceress executed.

130
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:50,923
Isabelle's looking for them, too.

131
00:09:51,064 --> 00:09:53,340
And she's working through you...

132
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:56,169
using you as a vessel.

133
00:09:56,439 --> 00:10:01,124
I gave a copy of the map
to jason, as well.

134
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,391
I'm not surprised
he didn't tell you about it.

135
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,935
Your kinship with...

136
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,279
isabelle may not be a secret,
but are you aware

137
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:16,459
that jason is a direct
descendant of the duchess...

138
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:18,373
Gertrude.

139
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,334
Going somewhere?

140
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,818
China.

141
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,742
China? Are you serious?

142
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,100
And freaked out and mad and just about
everything else you can possibly imagine.

143
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,645
Lana, what's going on?

144
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:37,393
Which part... the immaculate tattoo,

145
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:40,461
the fact that I seem to be
harboring a 16th-century witch,

146
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:44,934
or that jason and lex took off with a map
to uncover it all behind my back?

147
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:45,970
Why would they do that?

148
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:48,927
I don't know, but jason said that we
were gonna figure this out together,

149
00:11:48,962 --> 00:11:52,943
But it turns out he has a rather
limited definition of "we. "

150
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:56,806
Well, maybe he has a good reason
why he's not being open with you.

151
00:11:58,955 --> 00:12:00,622
Don't you think you owe him
a chance to explain?

152
00:12:00,646 --> 00:12:03,746
Clark, you know that I don't give up
on someone that easily.

153
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,558
But I'm not gonna just
let him lie to me...

154
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:11,519
even if it is for a good reason.

155
00:12:11,543 --> 00:12:14,396
So you're gonna take off and fly halfway
around the world just like that?

156
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:17,132
Lionel luthor made all the arrangements,
and I'm taking the luthorcorp jet.

157
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:20,643
And I know, clark,
that I can't trust him.

158
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:25,034
But he gave me the name of this
professor that might be able to help.

159
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,581
Well, then I'm going with you.

160
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:34,969
I'm not gonna drag you into this.

161
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:37,307
I'm not letting you go alone.

162
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:43,519
Jason...

163
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:45,973
you can't trust my father.

164
00:12:46,553 --> 00:12:49,172
He gave you that map for a reason, and
now you're leading him right to the stone.

165
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:51,614
I'm not working for
your father or anyone else.

166
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,704
Then why does the stone
even matter to you?

167
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,592
'Cause until I find out,
lana's not gonna be safe.

168
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:56,566
Safe from what?

169
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:57,752
From my mom,

170
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:00,711
from lionel, from you.
I don't know, lex. You tell me.

171
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,435
Look, unless you hired
your own chinese security,

172
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,536
I think we've hit a bit of a snag.

173
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:06,933
Run!

174
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:32,310
What is this?

175
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,612
How did lionel know
these symbols were about you?

176
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,876
There are two answers to that question.

177
00:14:10,923 --> 00:14:13,632
And they're both three time zones way.

178
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:20,313
Clark, um, I'm sorry.
I feel like...

179
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:24,582
you're the only person in my life right
now who doesn't have an agenda.

180
00:14:28,304 --> 00:14:31,604
Lana, whatever their motives are,
I'm sure they still care about you.

181
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:37,137
That still doesn't change the fact that everybody
seems to know more about me than I do.

182
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:42,162
It must be scary to think that someone out there
has a plan for you, but you don't know what it is yet.

183
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:48,561
Ever since that tattoo appeared,
I feel like I've been

184
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,473
walking around with this huge secret.

185
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,350
Like, everybody only knows
what's on the surface, but

186
00:14:54,397 --> 00:14:57,872
there's something inside of me
that's so much more powerful.

187
00:14:57,921 --> 00:15:00,480
And you're afraid if people
know about that part of you,

188
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,195
they'll see you differently.

189
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:03,737
How could they not?

190
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:12,100
So, um,

191
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:15,447
what did your parents say
about coming to china?

192
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,137
Nothing.

193
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:25,709
I didn't tell them.
I left them a message.

194
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:32,064
It's funny...

195
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,925
the two people I ended up trusting are...

196
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:39,344
lionel luthor

197
00:15:39,611 --> 00:15:40,879
and you.

198
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,794
Well, boss,

199
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,164
got any idea what we're doing here?

200
00:15:58,397 --> 00:16:02,087
Well, since they took the map
and brought us to the temple,

201
00:16:02,134 --> 00:16:05,175
I'm guessing they're after
the same thing we are.

202
00:16:08,287 --> 00:16:10,905
You're pretty anxious to make me
your sidekick, aren't you?

203
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:14,168
Don't you think it's time we dropped
the stalemate of who knows what,

204
00:16:14,215 --> 00:16:15,967
and do whatever we can
to get out of here?

205
00:16:16,012 --> 00:16:18,255
If you want us to start
spilling our guts,

206
00:16:18,642 --> 00:16:20,086
you go first.

207
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,390
Okay.

208
00:16:26,748 --> 00:16:32,032
We both know my father had every inch of
this place scoured, and he didn't find the stone.

209
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,761
Come on, jason.

210
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:40,221
You wouldn't have lied to lana and come all the way here unless you knew the secret to reading that map.

211
00:16:40,257 --> 00:16:42,112
No, I lied to lana to protect her.

212
00:16:42,147 --> 00:16:43,436
Oh, right...

213
00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:46,912
I forgot. Lana's new
self-appointed hero.

214
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,495
She seems to have a way
of attracting them.

215
00:16:51,197 --> 00:16:52,677
Yeah, it looks that way.

216
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:01,896
I don't believe you're that naive.

217
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:06,281
You're either being used
by my father or your mother.

218
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:10,625
Who's ever pulling the strings... don't think
for a second they wouldn't sacrifice lana.

219
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:15,954
In the end, I have a feeling I may be
the one protecting lana from you.

220
00:17:28,293 --> 00:17:29,491
Okay, okay.

221
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:33,154
You can't do this.

222
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,043
Where are you taking me?

223
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:39,814
Where are you taking me?

224
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:53,125
It's hard to believe we were driving
by cornstalks this morning.

225
00:17:53,149 --> 00:17:56,177
We are definitely
not in kansas anymore.

226
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:03,445
So how are we supposed
to find this professor sen?

227
00:18:08,068 --> 00:18:08,897
Um...

228
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,763
lionel said to just take this street, uh,

229
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,006
until we finda green rooster.

230
00:18:17,151 --> 00:18:20,439
You know, lana, I'm not sure
we should trust this woman.

231
00:18:20,861 --> 00:18:22,716
Maybe we can do this on our own.

232
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:28,139
I'm sorry, I didn't realize that you spoke fluent
mandarin and knew your way around shanghai.

233
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:32,683
Miss lang, mr. Kent.

234
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,679
I'm glad you guys made it here safely.

235
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:36,381
Do you have the map?

236
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:42,170
Oh, I never really believed this existed.

237
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:45,493
You have no idea how many fortune
hunter shave searched for this map.

238
00:18:46,868 --> 00:18:49,486
The temple seems to be
located at the fork of a river.

239
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,518
That's odd. There's no river there.

240
00:18:51,553 --> 00:18:53,925
But these symbols... they match
those on the temple walls.

241
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,451
So you know where it is.

242
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:59,077
I know the place well.
There's no mistaking that symbol.

243
00:18:59,124 --> 00:19:02,071
Are you sure this is the only temple
with these kind of markings?

244
00:19:02,106 --> 00:19:03,809
On this continent, anyway.

245
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:05,864
That's all part of the temple's mystique.

246
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:09,034
There's a myth that claimed
an all-powerful god

247
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:12,193
that came from another world
and hid a treasure there.

248
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,576
The god left some kind of map to it,

249
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:18,711
but the map was stolen centuries
ago by european bandits.

250
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,539
As far as we know,
they never found the treasure.

251
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:25,014
Can you take usto it?

252
00:19:25,061 --> 00:19:25,988
Of course.

253
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:28,301
But don't show this to anyone.

254
00:19:28,489 --> 00:19:31,307
As long as the stone is still out there,

255
00:19:31,354 --> 00:19:34,537
there are fortune seekers
who are willing to kill for it.

256
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,242
We need to be carefull.

257
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,191
Other people may know you are here.

258
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,209
Lex.

259
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:00,757
No! Lex...

260
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:02,823
look, tell them whatever
they want to know!

261
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,926
This isn't worth dying over!

262
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,691
Just scare him.

263
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:20,012
Find out what he knows,
but don't hurt him.

264
00:20:20,764 --> 00:20:22,819
I'm sorry, mr. Luthor.

265
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:25,180
I can't make such a promise.

266
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:30,182
We had an agreement.

267
00:20:30,217 --> 00:20:32,974
There are people who have
more money than you.

268
00:20:39,056 --> 00:20:41,396
I never wanted anyone harmed!

269
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:55,439
During the cultural revolution,

270
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:58,374
the gouvernement destroyed
most of the ancient temples.

271
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,406
But for some reason,
they protected this one.

272
00:21:01,617 --> 00:21:04,881
Maybe because it's always
been shrouded in superstition.

273
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:07,873
Villagers have refused
to cross the threshold,

274
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,337
fearful that the god will one
day return as he promised.

275
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,634
Clark, did you find something?

276
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,934
Just more symbols.

277
00:21:44,227 --> 00:21:47,479
Why don't you two keep searching
around? I'll look more in here.

278
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:49,730
This way.

279
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:54,497
This is an other chamber in the east wing.

280
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,044
What was that?

281
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:56,283
Run, lana!

282
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:51,000
Enough!

283
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:57,237
Tell me...

284
00:23:57,272 --> 00:23:59,233
where this leads to.

285
00:24:09,243 --> 00:24:12,695
Do you really think your friend
will have such strong will?

286
00:24:27,462 --> 00:24:28,886
Where is the stone?!

287
00:24:29,324 --> 00:24:30,763
Where is the stone?!

288
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,844
Where is the stone?!

289
00:24:40,107 --> 00:24:43,348
I hope your young friend
will have more sense than you.

290
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,048
Lana.

291
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:53,512
No... don't.

292
00:24:54,498 --> 00:24:56,424
- Don't!
- No, no, no!

293
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:04,170
No, I don't know anything!

294
00:25:04,205 --> 00:25:06,060
She has nothing to do with this!

295
00:25:06,107 --> 00:25:07,939
Maybe not.

296
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:09,875
Wait!

297
00:25:11,953 --> 00:25:13,010
No!

298
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:22,874
Stop!

299
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:38,743
Mitare me us animame.

300
00:25:41,692 --> 00:25:42,960
Liberare!

301
00:26:06,254 --> 00:26:10,328
Did you really think I would let any harm
come to this body I've possessed?

302
00:26:11,244 --> 00:26:12,865
You two again.

303
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,109
Isabelle.

304
00:26:14,896 --> 00:26:17,925
You are a resilient lad, aren't you?

305
00:26:18,195 --> 00:26:22,791
So earnest, and yet so tragically doomed
to pay for the sins of your ancestors.

306
00:26:22,838 --> 00:26:24,493
Lana, if there's any part
of you in there...

307
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:26,947
and you, greedy boy...

308
00:26:28,075 --> 00:26:33,640
I can only imagine what mischief you would cause
were you to unite the stones of knowledge.

309
00:26:37,186 --> 00:26:41,002
Too bad that neither of you could see
what was right in front of you all along.

310
00:26:43,783 --> 00:26:45,709
It was never a map.

311
00:27:15,976 --> 00:27:16,810
Clark!

312
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:27,267
You put up a better fight last time.

313
00:28:03,912 --> 00:28:05,368
Clark, what are you doing here?

314
00:28:07,094 --> 00:28:08,268
I could ask you the same thing.

315
00:28:08,315 --> 00:28:10,367
How could you put lana
in the middle of this?

316
00:28:10,403 --> 00:28:12,058
I swear, clark, if anything happens to her

317
00:28:12,093 --> 00:28:13,514
she's here because you lied to her!

318
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:15,769
I get the feeling that lana
can handle herself right now!

319
00:28:15,804 --> 00:28:18,845
If isabelle gets her hand on that stone,
there's no telling what's gonna happen to lana.

320
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,575
Clark, if there's anything
you know that we don'T...

321
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,992
I think I found something.

322
00:28:35,827 --> 00:28:40,946
Clark, how did you just stumble on this when my
father had this place searched from top to bottom?

323
00:28:41,392 --> 00:28:43,107
What do you want me to say, lex?

324
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:47,474
It's obviously been here a long time.

325
00:28:53,136 --> 00:28:54,897
Don't you want to look at this?

326
00:29:03,037 --> 00:29:04,141
Hang on...

327
00:29:04,928 --> 00:29:06,219
let me see the map.

328
00:29:07,347 --> 00:29:08,580
Let me see it.

329
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:21,692
Well?

330
00:29:21,733 --> 00:29:24,174
Guys, this isn't a map to the temple.

331
00:29:25,268 --> 00:29:27,898
It's a drawing of the temple through the tree.

332
00:29:35,197 --> 00:29:37,381
That's why no one could find the stone here.

333
00:29:37,604 --> 00:29:41,655
But from this perspective... the background
goes on for miles. It could be anywhere.

334
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:45,671
What if it's not in the background?

335
00:29:45,703 --> 00:29:48,733
Think about it. The artist would've
been standing right where you are.

336
00:29:49,202 --> 00:29:52,337
What if it's located there
at the base of the tree?

337
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,749
Spectaculum lapis.

338
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,528
Nobody has sacrificed as
much as I have for these stones.

339
00:31:53,572 --> 00:31:54,797
They don't belong to you.

340
00:31:54,841 --> 00:31:57,143
And you think they were meant for you?

341
00:31:57,675 --> 00:31:59,532
They were left for nobody.

342
00:31:59,945 --> 00:32:03,266
The god of this temple
hid them for his return.

343
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:15,302
Penetrare eims corpus.

344
00:33:26,877 --> 00:33:29,150
How'd we get away from the guards?

345
00:33:35,688 --> 00:33:37,031
It was isabelle.

346
00:33:39,594 --> 00:33:41,232
What'd I do?

347
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:53,541
Did you find the stone?

348
00:34:01,524 --> 00:34:02,719
It's gone.

349
00:34:32,963 --> 00:34:37,975
Kinda hard to take a college application essay
seriously after the last couple of days, isn't it?

350
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,503
I was just trying to figure out if hidden
temples and body-snatching witches

351
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:44,690
fits under "community service"
or "extracurriculars. "

352
00:34:46,373 --> 00:34:50,054
Did I come at a bad time? You seemed
kind of startled when you saw me.

353
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:52,637
No, I just, um...

354
00:34:54,157 --> 00:34:58,584
I thought maybe you were my parents. I've
been avoiding them ever since we got back.

355
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:02,038
And the real reason would be?

356
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:05,707
Seeing you speak latin and throw
those guys around the roomlike

357
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:07,699
toothpicks is kind of weird.

358
00:35:09,987 --> 00:35:12,259
And even when isabelle's gone,

359
00:35:12,496 --> 00:35:16,685
sometimes I look at you, and there's a part
of you that I don't recognize anymore.

360
00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:21,378
What?

361
00:35:21,422 --> 00:35:24,477
I'm sorry. It's just that...

362
00:35:25,951 --> 00:35:29,346
do you know how funny
that sounds coming from you?

363
00:35:35,264 --> 00:35:39,544
Somehow, I think that the only way
that I'm going to put isabelle and

364
00:35:39,577 --> 00:35:44,403
all of this other stuff behind me
is if I find all three of those stones.

365
00:35:46,542 --> 00:35:48,564
I'm sure they'll end up in the right hands.

366
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:50,439
I hope so...

367
00:35:50,985 --> 00:35:56,159
because right now I kinda feel like some random
piece of a puzzle I'll never understand.

368
00:35:56,218 --> 00:35:58,934
Well, maybe we're not supposed
to understand it just yet.

369
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,743
I get the feeling that our lives
are a lot less random than we think.

370
00:36:11,993 --> 00:36:13,085
Maybe.

371
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,797
Good night, clark.

372
00:37:04,866 --> 00:37:06,534
How was china?

373
00:37:06,578 --> 00:37:08,423
Full of surprises.

374
00:37:09,409 --> 00:37:10,560
Lex, what happened?

375
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:13,999
Even though getting pistol-whipped
wasn't exactly my idea of fun,

376
00:37:14,043 --> 00:37:16,862
I have to admit, it's good
to have the old dad back.

377
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:21,083
No, I had nothing to do with
what happened to you in china, son.

378
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:23,707
I have abandoned my search for the stones.

379
00:37:23,766 --> 00:37:25,121
Come on, dad,

380
00:37:25,165 --> 00:37:29,534
you stole copies of my map and gave
them to lana and jason. You used them.

381
00:37:29,593 --> 00:37:32,205
No, lex. It was you who was using them.

382
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:35,467
And you'll do far worse to find those stones.

383
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:42,644
You have a ferocious desire to find
all the answers, son, but don't...

384
00:37:42,688 --> 00:37:48,016
let your search for those stones
turn into your personal tower of babel.

385
00:37:49,138 --> 00:37:52,147
I'm not trying to get closer to god, dad.

386
00:37:52,368 --> 00:37:55,497
I'm trying to solve the riddles he's laid out for me.

387
00:37:56,279 --> 00:37:59,098
Did you ever think there might be a reason
why we weren't given the answers?

388
00:37:59,142 --> 00:38:00,397
To challenge us?

389
00:38:00,441 --> 00:38:02,360
Or maybe to humble us.

390
00:38:02,404 --> 00:38:05,058
Knowledge comes from finding the answers,

391
00:38:05,102 --> 00:38:09,043
yes, but understanding
what the answers mean...

392
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:11,507
is what brings wisdom.

393
00:38:11,876 --> 00:38:15,182
Men who didn't understand the
difference have been the ruin of...

394
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:18,043
some of the world's greatest civilizations.

395
00:38:20,596 --> 00:38:23,294
Is that why you stopped
looking for the stones?

396
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,010
Because you're afraid?

397
00:38:28,297 --> 00:38:32,769
No. No, I stopped because I realized
that even if I find the three stones,

398
00:38:33,035 --> 00:38:35,745
I'm not gonna find
what I'm really looking for.

399
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:39,848
Neither will you.

400
00:38:48,734 --> 00:38:50,299
Can I at least come in?

401
00:38:58,298 --> 00:39:02,488
I guess I don't have to ask why I haven't heard
from you since we got back from shanghai.

402
00:39:07,904 --> 00:39:09,675
I'm sorry I lied to you.

403
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:12,686
I don't even know which lie
you're apologizing for.

404
00:39:12,727 --> 00:39:15,531
That you said you were in metropolis
when you really were in china,

405
00:39:15,575 --> 00:39:18,188
or that you've been working
with your mom all along?

406
00:39:18,926 --> 00:39:22,851
I wasn't honest about going to china because
I didn't want to put you into danger.

407
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:27,485
If you remember a certain torture chair,
I'd say that's pretty decent foresight.

408
00:39:30,274 --> 00:39:32,045
You have to believe me.

409
00:39:33,403 --> 00:39:35,233
Give me one good reason.

410
00:39:36,355 --> 00:39:37,417
Okay.

411
00:39:45,377 --> 00:39:46,661
Is that good enough?

412
00:39:50,277 --> 00:39:52,048
Jason, how did you...

413
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:56,318
I got there right before lex.
I saw you and clark knocked out.

414
00:39:56,481 --> 00:39:58,547
And there it was... right in front of me.

415
00:39:59,728 --> 00:40:04,111
I didn't want lex or clark to know about it,
so I mailed it to myself from china.

416
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,930
Did you tell your mom?

417
00:40:07,397 --> 00:40:08,961
I got it for you.

418
00:40:10,156 --> 00:40:14,805
All I care about is protecting you, okay?
You're the only one in my life that matters to me.

419
00:40:21,021 --> 00:40:23,072
Blink twice if you can understand me.

420
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,357
Well,

421
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:52,703
I do hope you brought us a souvenir.

422
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:57,234
I know that going to china is grounds
for a serious lecture, but I didn't have a choice.

423
00:40:57,278 --> 00:40:58,621
All right, clark.

424
00:40:59,345 --> 00:41:03,220
At least please tell us that the stone
is safe in the cave with the other one.

425
00:41:04,873 --> 00:41:09,743
Look, even though there was kryptonite
guarding the original map, I got the stone in my hand.

426
00:41:11,529 --> 00:41:12,798
But I lost it.

427
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:14,655
Clark, I don't understand.

428
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:18,684
If these stones were intended for you to find,
why would they be surrounded by kryptonite?

429
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:21,252
That makes me wonder if
they really were meant for me.

430
00:41:22,093 --> 00:41:24,307
But right now we have another problem.

431
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,422
Before he died,
dr. Swann sent me one last e-mail.

432
00:41:27,467 --> 00:41:29,506
He said he'd been searching
for the stones for years,

433
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:31,900
and even with the vast resources at his disposal,

434
00:41:31,983 --> 00:41:35,023
it was futile. I was his last hope.

435
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:39,672
And that's why he asked bridgette crosby
to give me the one stone he did find.

436
00:41:40,705 --> 00:41:42,063
Which stone?

437
00:41:42,122 --> 00:41:43,420
That's the thing.

438
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:45,856
I called her numbers.
They were all disconnected.

439
00:41:45,915 --> 00:41:47,877
No one even claims to have known her.

440
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,885
It's like she never existed.

441
00:42:10,801 --> 00:42:12,203
kal-el.

442
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,568
You must write your own destiny...

443
00:42:35,792 --> 00:42:39,792
