1
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,006
You know, it belonged
to Alexander the Great.

2
00:00:32,182 --> 00:00:35,174
They say the design symbolizes
strength and courage.

3
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:38,377
Can't exactly see myself going into battle
with that on my chest.

4
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:42,548
Darker times call for darker methods.
His opponents thought he was invincible.

5
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:45,854
-I didn't know you were a history buff.
-I'm not. I'm interested in people...

6
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:50,432
-...who ruled the world before they were 30.
-Don't worry, Lex, you have a few years.

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,568
Lana, I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

8
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:54,796
Didn't Lex tell you?

9
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,030
Must've slipped my mind.

10
00:00:59,242 --> 00:01:01,870
Why don't I leave you two alone?

11
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,307
Having fun?

12
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,315
Yeah, well, I'm feeling
a bit underdressed.

13
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:12,319
If it makes you feel any better,
Whitney is just as uncomfortable.

14
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,723
Whitney came too.

15
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:20,158
Why don't you join us? I'm gonna yank Nell
away from the jewelry exhibit so we can eat.

16
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,491
Yeah, sure.

17
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,504
Clark, where are you going?

18
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,771
I'm gonna get some air.

19
00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:41,576
You know, you're never gonna get her
if you keep running away from your enemy.

20
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,341
Whitney's not my enemy.

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,547
Yes, he is. And the sooner you realize that,
the sooner you'll find a way to win Lana.

22
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:50,522
Remember, keep your friends close
and the quarterback closer.

23
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,854
Always the hopeless romantic, Lex.

24
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:55,025
Victoria?

25
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,928
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?

26
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:02,862
Clark Kent, this is Victoria Hardwick,
a very old friend.

27
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,233
Hi.

28
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,203
Champagne?

29
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,537
How close are you gonna keep her?

30
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,544
I'll catch up with you later, Clark.

31
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,417
Want a private tour?

32
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,479
I thought you'd never ask.

33
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:32,527
You see this? I'm the only reason
you're not in a cage right now.

34
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:35,637
Now you get into the IA,
and you get me those files.

35
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:37,272
Why, is one of them yours?

36
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:44,303
You've got 24 hours to get creative.
Start thinking.

37
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:51,086
Well, welcome to Metropolis.

38
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,926
More or less.

39
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:28,573
Dad, let me help you.

40
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:37,749
Don't break a sweat.

41
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,946
So, night owl, how was Metropolis?

42
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:42,557
-Fine.
-Come on...

43
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:45,125
...a reception at the Metropolis Museum,
and it was fine?

44
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:48,286
The museum was amazing.
It's just....

45
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:49,829
It's just what?

46
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,423
Something happened.

47
00:05:55,172 --> 00:05:58,600
It could've been worse. I stopped
the bus before anyone was hurt.

48
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,141
-Clark, are you all right?
-I'm fine.

49
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,609
-What if somebody'd seen you do it?
-Everyone was still in the museum.

50
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,841
I think it's fine. There's no mention
of witnesses in the paper.

51
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:10,910
I'd better get to school.

52
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:16,948
Hey, Clark, look, I am real proud
of what you did.

53
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,151
We both are.

54
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,711
Did you bring them?

55
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,311
You know I'm not supposed to do this.

56
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,007
And I'm not the one with the DUI
on my record.

57
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:44,346
You wouldn't believe
how many rent-a-cops...

58
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,150
...forget to fill out the previous
criminal-record section on their job apps.

59
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:14,005
So, what do you think of Smallville?

60
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:18,017
It reminds me of the village
where my grandparents live in Wales.

61
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:22,180
Very quaint. Very safe.

62
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:26,158
And the last place I expected
to find Lex Luthor.

63
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:28,923
My father'll bring me back
to Metropolis in a few years.

64
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:31,191
-He's lying.
-I know.

65
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,164
You deserve something better.

66
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:35,770
And you crossed the pond
to tell me what that is.

67
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:38,429
Catching up with an old friend
isn't reason enough?

68
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:41,042
As much as I'd like to flatter myself...

69
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,771
...the daughters of multinational
industrialists usually don't...

70
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:48,439
...fly around the world
to rekindle old flames.

71
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:51,052
Neither do executive vice presidents.

72
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,053
-Then you've heard.
-That you're working for your father?

73
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,351
I keep up. How is Sir Harry?

74
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:01,924
Distant, inaccessible and rich.

75
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:04,896
-I believe you know the type.
-What's he want with me?

76
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:10,198
He understands you may have certain
negative feelings towards your father.

77
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:13,433
Sir Harry has always had
an incredible grasp of the obvious.

78
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:17,545
He was hoping those feelings might work
to our mutual advantage.

79
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:21,308
He'd like you to reconsider
your position with LuthorCorp.

80
00:08:21,484 --> 00:08:23,714
So he sent you here as an incentive.

81
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,278
I've missed you, Lex.

82
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,414
I'm touched.

83
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,416
Do you have a proposal?

84
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:38,094
First, I think I'd like something else.

85
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:45,768
-Another scathing editorial?
-Is there any other kind?

86
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,934
Clark, what happened to you last night?

87
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:53,104
I wasn't feeling well.
Guess I'm not much of a city guy.

88
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:58,185
You can take the boy off the farm,
but you can't take the farm out of the boy.

89
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:02,787
Sullivan, is this your idea of a joke?

90
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:06,186
-Parents have been calling all morning.
-What are you telling them?

91
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:09,297
What the EPA and other
environmental groups said years ago:

92
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,955
The meteor rocks are harmless.

93
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,193
People should know about
the strange things happening in this town!

94
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,601
<i>The Torch is a school paper.
It's not your own personal tabloid.</i>

95
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:18,933
Are you censoring me?

96
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:23,636
I'm requiring you to do your job, which is
to report on relevant school events:

97
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,840
Sports. Dances. Clubs.
I'm relieving you of your duties.

98
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,377
<i>The Torch is suspended
until I can appoint a new editor.</i>

99
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,658
-Okay, what just happened?
-I think you were fired.

100
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:41,826
Chloe, I'm sure we can do something.

101
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,363
Let me talk to Kwan.

102
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:45,966
Not to sound ungrateful,
but what can you do?

103
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:48,035
I don't know, but let me give it a shot.

104
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,073
Afternoon, Lex.

105
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,080
Or is it Mr. Luthor here in Smallville?

106
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,048
Phelan...

107
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:09,350
...isn't Smallville a couple of counties
outside your jurisdiction?

108
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,586
Well, I don't need jurisdiction
to look up an old friend.

109
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:15,526
We were never friends.

110
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:18,900
If you want to see me, call my office.

111
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:22,196
-When does it happen, Lex?
-When does what happen?

112
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,498
When do you turn on the people
that help you?

113
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,741
How many times did I pull you back
from the edge?

114
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,901
You'd be dead right now
if it wasn't for me.

115
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,708
You were on my father's payroll,
his go-to guy in the department.

116
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,717
You got paid to fix situations, so don't
try and pretend it was anything else.

117
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,718
You have a good life here, Lex.

118
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,221
I'd sure hate to see that get compromised.

119
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,360
You can't touch me, and you know it.

120
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:47,723
I'm looking for a witness.

121
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,957
I think he saw last night's accident
outside the museum.

122
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:52,725
And this concerns me why?

123
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,771
Sorry, I don't know who that is.

124
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,066
I'd have pegged you for buddies.

125
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:06,442
Guess you're losing your instinct.
Maybe you should think about retiring.

126
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,819
Hello?

127
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,921
Hello?

128
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,929
Anybody home?

129
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,874
Dad?

130
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:39,170
Is that you?

131
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,189
Metropolis Police.

132
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:10,076
Kid, I don't know
what they've been feeding you...

133
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:12,680
...but that was pretty impressive.

134
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:16,340
Not quite as exciting as last night,
but I wanted to be sure.

135
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,214
Who are you?

136
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:21,481
I am your new best friend, Clark.

137
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:24,484
How do you know my name?

138
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,820
I asked around.

139
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:30,830
That's the beauty of a small town,
everybody's just so eager to help.

140
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,464
Far cry from Metropolis.

141
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:36,303
-What do you want with me?
-Your help.

142
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:40,731
You see, Clark, I'm in a battle
that I can't afford to lose...

143
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,368
...because if I do, well, the bad guys win.

144
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:48,415
And you have this gift that I need.

145
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,376
I'll never help you.

146
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,256
You have a secret you don't want
the world to know about.

147
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:03,223
I'm guessing that's why you didn't stick
around for the TV cameras last night.

148
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:08,094
You want to keep things that way,
you'll do like I say.

149
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:13,033
Drop by that overpriced coffee shop
tomorrow afternoon...

150
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,508
...and we'll talk about your future.

151
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,942
Nice catch.

152
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,222
So he just dropped the generator
right on top of you?

153
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,387
How did he know it wouldn't kill you?

154
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,492
He saw me stop the bus last night.

155
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,928
Maybe we should call the police.

156
00:13:43,105 --> 00:13:46,233
He is the police. I saw his badge.

157
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,773
Metropolis P.D.

158
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,306
Dad.

159
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,350
I didn't mean for this to happen.

160
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:02,787
Clark, you didn't do anything wrong, okay?

161
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,261
He told me to meet him
at the Beanery tomorrow.

162
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,093
I don't want you going
anywhere near this guy.

163
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,203
I'll talk to him,
and I'll find out what he wants.

164
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:16,360
Until then--

165
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:19,269
Until then, you live your life,
you see your friends.

166
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,001
Now, we're not gonna let
this thing change us.

167
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,596
You look like you're carrying
the weight of the world.

168
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:45,791
I'm sorry if I surprised you,
but there's really nowhere to knock.

169
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:50,467
It's okay. Thanks again for last night.

170
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:55,307
Your first visit to Metropolis, and you're
involved in a police investigation?

171
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,404
That has to be some kind of record.

172
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:01,675
-How'd you know about that?
-The detective came to see me first.

173
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,839
What'd he tell you?

174
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:04,849
Not much.

175
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:07,215
Maybe that's what's bothering me.

176
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:08,512
What do you mean?

177
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:13,754
Metropolis Police usually don't send
detectives to investigate traffic accidents.

178
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:19,663
So I made a call. Turns out the official
investigation is already closed.

179
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,930
Clark, you really don't want
Sam Phelan in your life.

180
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,240
You know him.

181
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,699
Unfortunately.

182
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:31,004
I had my share of legal problems
while I was in Metropolis.

183
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,343
-Serious?
-Expensive.

184
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,952
Phelan was the kind of officer
my father felt we could turn to for help.

185
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,212
He's a dirty cop.

186
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:41,856
He'll do whatever it takes
to get the job done.

187
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,516
Plant evidence. Falsify reports.
Anything is fair game.

188
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,095
And if he's got something on you,
Clark, he'll use it.

189
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,928
He just wanted to talk.

190
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:53,898
Then you've got nothing to worry about.

191
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,033
Hey, Mr. Kent.

192
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,475
Mr. Kent?

193
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,074
Sam Phelan, Metropolis P.D.

194
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:08,940
I figured you'd be the one to show.

195
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:11,382
-What do you want?
-We're both rational adults.

196
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,215
-Let's sit down, talk--
-I don't think a rational adult...

197
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,621
...drops a generator on top
of a teenage boy, do you?

198
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:20,159
Well, we both know it wouldn't hurt him.

199
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:33,907
All right, what do you want?

200
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,805
I just want Clark's help.

201
00:16:35,978 --> 00:16:37,138
With what?

202
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:40,907
Look around you, Mr. Kent.
You know what you see?

203
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:45,315
The veneer of safety. Now, people like me
are sworn to protect that.

204
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:49,651
I'm the guy standing between the criminals
and respectable citizens like yourself.

205
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:54,922
Now, Clark has a gift...

206
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:59,431
...and I would like to use his talents
to further my cause.

207
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:04,202
I will not let you exploit my son.

208
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,642
I've spent the morning going
through the local police files.

209
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:14,082
Clark's name comes up quite a bit.

210
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:16,513
Clark has never been in trouble
a day in his life.

211
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:21,452
No arrests, but he's been
around a lot of crime scenes.

212
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,614
Now, maybe that's coincidence...

213
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:27,956
...or maybe it's just his natural instinct
to get involved.

214
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:39,536
Okay, I will give you whatever you want.
You just stay away from my family.

215
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,344
I want your son.

216
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:48,713
No.

217
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,020
I'll be in touch.

218
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:04,557
Of course, if you don't agree,
I will tell the world what I know.

219
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:09,830
Best case, Clark's under a microscope.
Worst case, he's a freak in a jar.

220
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:14,339
Either way, his normal life is over.

221
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:18,609
Do not push me!

222
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:21,511
Easy there, Mr. Kent.

223
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:30,691
We were just talking.

224
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:34,896
You know, if I were you,
I'd learn to keep that temper in check.

225
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:37,691
It could get you in a lot of trouble.

226
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:52,207
Hey, Clark, you okay?

227
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,282
Fine, just doing a little research.

228
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,680
Have you heard about
Lana's meeting with Kwan?

229
00:18:57,853 --> 00:18:59,286
Chloe, I'm sure it'll work out.

230
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,147
Hey.

231
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:05,054
-So how'd it go?
-Well, it's interesting.

232
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,218
When can we send out the next issue?

233
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,227
Day after tomorrow.

234
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,422
Cool.

235
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,567
Except...

236
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:15,565
...Kwan made me the new editor.

237
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,404
Okay, rewind. I need you to say
that last part again.

238
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,605
After I made my case, Kwan said
that if I had that much passion...

239
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:29,148
...I should be in charge.

240
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,245
I don't believe this!

241
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,355
It's the only way he'd reopen the paper.

242
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:36,385
So, what? Cheerleading's not enough?

243
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:40,119
Maybe the editor of a school newspaper
looks better on a college application.

244
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,590
That isn't it! I figured
you could ghostwrite...

245
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,665
-...until we got you reinstated.
-So then I would work for you.

246
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:48,598
-The paper would still be yours.
-Wait, wait.

247
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,795
Chloe, think about it. It's not a bad idea.

248
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:54,099
It figures you'd side with her.

249
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,675
-I'm not taking sides.
-Right.

250
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:59,007
You're completely objective
in all things Lana.

251
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,513
-Gotta go.
-No, please, Clark, stay!

252
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,616
-Take my desk!
-Chloe...

253
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:09,120
-...this isn't what you think.
-You know what the weirdest part is?

254
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,852
For a millisecond, I almost thought
you were my friend.

255
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,003
Get in, kid.

256
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:37,383
-What do you want?
-Your father came to see me.

257
00:20:37,552 --> 00:20:40,885
He seemed like a really good man,
always putting his family first.

258
00:20:41,723 --> 00:20:45,250
You know, if I were you,
I'd start thinking like him.

259
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,395
I assume you've had a chance to read
my father's proposal.

260
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,057
I didn't have to.

261
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:58,506
So you've added mind reading
to your many abilities.

262
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,835
I know why you're here, Victoria.

263
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,672
Sir Harry wants to take over LuthorCorp,
and he needs my shares to do it.

264
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,213
Your father didn't dream up
this little plan, did he?

265
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,513
Do you think if you take over LuthorCorp...

266
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,953
...Daddy will finally give you
the respect you deserve?

267
00:21:16,124 --> 00:21:17,682
He won't, Victoria.

268
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,190
So, what are you suggesting?

269
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,691
You came to play on
my hatred of my father.

270
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,729
Now I'm going to play on yours.

271
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,597
Why take one company,
when you can take two?

272
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,937
You know they'd probably kill us.

273
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:32,698
Probably.

274
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:36,210
But that's what makes
life interesting.

275
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,829
What are we doing here?

276
00:22:03,005 --> 00:22:05,735
You want to know the biggest obstacle
to my job, Clark?

277
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,808
It's not the perps. It's the bureaucracy.

278
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:12,845
How am I supposed to fight crime
with one hand tied behind my back?

279
00:22:13,015 --> 00:22:14,812
You said we were going after bad guys.

280
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:18,817
We are. They're called Internal Affairs.

281
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,688
In fact, the head of the IA division...

282
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:25,258
...lives right up there on the fifth floor.

283
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,586
I'm not gonna hurt anybody!

284
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,700
Relax, you're just gonna help me
retrieve some files.

285
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:37,769
See, these IA types, they have
a real trust problem.

286
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:42,774
Well, it turns out the deputy chief keeps
all his most sensitive case files at home.

287
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,607
The man's got a safe, so you find it.
You open it...

288
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,512
...and you bring me whatever's inside.

289
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,653
You do this one thing for me,
and I'll never trouble you again.

290
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:58,016
I know what you're about, Phelan.
Lex Luthor told me.

291
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:04,293
Yeah, well, your friend Lex isn't exactly
on the side of the angels.

292
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:07,798
He's got his secrets, just like you.

293
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,400
It's apartment 517.

294
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:04,748
Hey, Phelan!

295
00:24:08,096 --> 00:24:10,064
Want your file?

296
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,364
It's all yours.

297
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:17,037
Did you call them?

298
00:24:17,939 --> 00:24:21,875
You're making a big mistake, kid.

299
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:39,120
Morning, guys.

300
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:42,786
What time did you get in last night?
I didn't hear you.

301
00:24:42,964 --> 00:24:44,522
Late.

302
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:47,224
I was helping Lana at the Torch.

303
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,632
I sort of lost track of time.

304
00:24:49,804 --> 00:24:52,864
Clark, has Phelan tried to contact you?

305
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:56,442
Dad, don't worry, I think
he's out of our lives forever.

306
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:02,378
Ethan, Bob...

307
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:04,348
...what's going on?

308
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,919
We got a warrant.

309
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,580
It's a warrant to search
your property, Jonathan.

310
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,091
A warrant? Come on in.

311
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:16,087
What for?

312
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,858
We got a tip from Metropolis P.D.

313
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,397
You'd better come and take a look at this.

314
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,674
Looks like he was shot in the heart.

315
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,781
You wanna explain what a dead body's
doing in your barn?

316
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:44,983
-I've never seen that man before.
-Ethan, we found this...

317
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,459
...hidden under the seat in the truck.

318
00:25:49,197 --> 00:25:52,166
That is not my gun,
and I have no idea how it got in my truck.

319
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:54,734
I'm sorry, but we
have to place you under arrest.

320
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:56,029
Dad.

321
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:58,138
It's all right.

322
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,798
Call Bill Ross and have him
meet me at the jail.

323
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,711
You're not taking him!

324
00:26:06,881 --> 00:26:12,012
Clark. Clark, I need you to stay here.

325
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,349
And I need you to be strong.

326
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,162
I'll follow in the car.

327
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:47,145
That's what you get for trying
to be a hero, Clark.

328
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:51,253
You're a pretty smart boy,
but you forget...

329
00:26:51,426 --> 00:26:54,361
...l've been doing this a long time.

330
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,463
-Who's that man?
-Did you really think...

331
00:26:56,631 --> 00:27:02,297
...that you could double-cross me?
Clark, my job is about scenarios.

332
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,529
You never enter a crack house
with one plan.

333
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:08,540
You go in with 10.
That's how you survive.

334
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:13,204
The truth is, kid, you didn't leave me
with a lot of options!

335
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,542
-I want my dad out of jail.
-You complicate my life?

336
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,151
I'm gonna complicate yours!

337
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,345
Call them now and tell them what you did!

338
00:27:22,123 --> 00:27:25,183
What is it, Clark? You wanna kill me?

339
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,723
You think that's the answer
to your problems?

340
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,057
I want him out!

341
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,722
Well, then, we both want something...

342
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,837
...only you have a lot more to lose.

343
00:27:44,646 --> 00:27:47,945
I don't want any more surprises.

344
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,518
I'm gonna let you think about last night.

345
00:27:57,325 --> 00:28:00,123
Stay close. I'll be in touch.

346
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,573
Clark, what are you doing here?

347
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:23,510
Hiding out.

348
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:27,645
I heard about your dad.
I know it isn't true.

349
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:30,616
Thanks.

350
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,951
How are you doing?

351
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,224
To be honest, I'm in way over my head.

352
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,759
All I wanted to do is help Chloe, and
now I feel like I've screwed up everything.

353
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:47,268
Guess that's what you get
when you try to be a hero.

354
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,342
I know the feeling.

355
00:28:53,047 --> 00:28:56,813
You ever think your aunt's life would be
simpler if she hadn't adopted you?

356
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,116
Clark, what's going on?

357
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:05,587
Just seems like all I ever do is
complicate my parents' lives.

358
00:29:06,728 --> 00:29:10,494
You can't blame yourself
for what's happening with your dad.

359
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:13,333
Every family goes through rough times.

360
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,732
When I was 10,
I tried to run away to Metropolis.

361
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:19,669
Nell found me at the bus stop.
It was freezing.

362
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:23,605
As she was driving me home,
I asked her if she regretted adopting me.

363
00:29:24,245 --> 00:29:27,510
She stopped the car.
I remember because it started snowing.

364
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,579
She looked me in the eye.

365
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:34,350
She said it was the best thing
she had ever done.

366
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:38,185
She didn't love me any less
because I was adopted...

367
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,123
...but she worried about me more.

368
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:45,965
I've gotta go.

369
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,932
Don't worry, Clark.

370
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,895
It'll all work out.

371
00:30:00,615 --> 00:30:03,709
Right here.

372
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,860
Hi, son. Where's your mother?

373
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:24,402
The police are questioning her.

374
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:28,169
I lied to you.

375
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,578
-What do you mean?
-I did see Phelan again.

376
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,977
When?

377
00:30:40,154 --> 00:30:43,612
Last night. I went with him to Metropolis.

378
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:48,251
I broke into an apartment,
found a safe with confidential files.

379
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,756
Oh, Clark.

380
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,228
I didn't have a choice.

381
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:54,732
That's what he wanted you to think,
but you always have a choice.

382
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:56,427
I was protecting you and Mom.

383
00:30:56,604 --> 00:31:00,768
You can not protect your mother and I
by lying to us. Come on!

384
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,341
Dad, there's more.

385
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,541
Phelan came back after you were arrested.

386
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:13,886
I got so angry that I grabbed him...

387
00:31:14,188 --> 00:31:17,351
...and for a second, I wanted to--

388
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,985
I wanted to kill him.

389
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,562
But you didn't, right?

390
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:29,265
Yeah, but I was close.

391
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:43,073
Believe me, son, I know all there is
to know about losing your temper.

392
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:45,815
But you can't afford to do it.

393
00:31:46,387 --> 00:31:50,551
This is Phelan's game,
and he will play your fear and your anger.

394
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:52,818
But you cannot let him get to you.

395
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,895
I don't care. I won't let anybody hurt
you and Mom.

396
00:31:56,064 --> 00:31:57,656
And he knows that.

397
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,666
But once you've crossed that line,
there's no going back.

398
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:22,187
Clark, I just heard about your dad.
Is he all right?

399
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,346
He's hanging in there.

400
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,854
This is crazy.
Your father didn't kill anyone.

401
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,861
Give me five minutes, I'll get
the 10 best lawyers in the state.

402
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,056
I don't think lawyers are gonna help.

403
00:32:34,102 --> 00:32:35,330
It's Phelan, isn't it?

404
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:41,765
-What's he got on you, Clark?
-Just stay out of it, all right? Please.

405
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:44,411
Listen to me.

406
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:47,738
You may think you know
how Phelan works, but you'd be wrong.

407
00:32:47,915 --> 00:32:49,405
Sounds like you're an expert.

408
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:53,543
-I understand his world.
-Yeah, he told me you have secrets.

409
00:32:56,457 --> 00:32:59,221
There are parts of my life
I'm not proud of, Clark...

410
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,885
...but I don't want to see you
or your family hurt.

411
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,724
Now, let me help.

412
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,264
You can't, Lex.

413
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,465
I gotta handle this on my own.

414
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:28,515
You busy, Clark?

415
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:33,517
-What do you want from me?
-That's complicated.

416
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:36,994
After last night, I've got
Internal Affairs asking me...

417
00:33:37,165 --> 00:33:39,099
...more questions than I want to answer.

418
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,291
That's your problem!

419
00:33:40,468 --> 00:33:43,096
No, it's our problem.

420
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:46,872
But our next bit of business
is gonna be our last.

421
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:50,169
Look, I don't care.
You can tell the whole world about me.

422
00:33:54,515 --> 00:33:58,611
Clark, you may not care about yourself,
but think about your parents.

423
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,921
Now, your father's in jail
on a murder charge.

424
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:06,789
And whether he beats it or not, he's
gonna lose this farm just paying legal fees.

425
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:10,192
I can still make all that go away.

426
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,661
So, what's it gonna be?

427
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,728
What are we doing here?

428
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:50,530
Since I couldn't pick up
my Internal Affairs records...

429
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,400
...I figured it was time to pick up
my retirement package.

430
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:59,573
The breastplate. You want me
to steal it for you.

431
00:34:59,747 --> 00:35:01,840
I don't give a damn about the breastplate.

432
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,850
I just want the 10 million dollars
worth of jewels that are on it.

433
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:09,951
Come on.

434
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,157
So we're just gonna bust in?

435
00:35:14,328 --> 00:35:19,265
Not quite. Metropolis P.D. keeps blueprints
on the high-security buildings in the city...

436
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:21,526
...so I know this place better
than the architect.

437
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:25,263
The security system all runs
through this junction box.

438
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,175
-Open it up.
-Isn't it alarmed?

439
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,741
They only alarm things they think
somebody could get through.

440
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,041
And, Clark, I'm getting pretty bored
with this.

441
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,517
You want your old life back, you do it.

442
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,700
Camera's are one thing.
What about the guards?

443
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:04,575
They're about to get real busy.

444
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,641
Yeah, Metropolis Museum? You have
two minutes to leave the building.

445
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:12,047
There's a bomb outside.

446
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,524
There's a bomb out here!

447
00:36:31,505 --> 00:36:34,201
Cameras are all dead in Luthor Hall.

448
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:01,859
Kid, show me the magic.

449
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,718
Standing by. Standing by.

450
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:42,503
We are gonna make a great team.

451
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,425
We'll never be a team.

452
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,771
You might be able to explain the safe,
but your prints are all over that breastplate.

453
00:38:16,944 --> 00:38:21,381
You might be strong,
but you're not bulletproof!

454
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,825
What are you?

455
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:16,263
In there!

456
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,667
Get down! Get down!

457
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,582
Phelan, where's Clark?
I know he came with you.

458
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:36,319
Just tell me what you had on him.

459
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:43,624
Go to hell, Luthor.

460
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,537
All the charges have been dropped.

461
00:40:00,948 --> 00:40:03,815
With apologies from the state
and Metropolis Police departments.

462
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,815
Then it's finally over.

463
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,476
Well, this time.

464
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,852
Unfortunately, there's more than
one Phelan out there in the world.

465
00:40:11,025 --> 00:40:12,390
What do we do next time?

466
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,653
I don't know, son.

467
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,059
We'll have to deal with it
when the time comes.

468
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:20,325
Maybe I should stop using my gifts.
That would solve our problems.

469
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,162
No, it wouldn't, Clark.

470
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:26,397
Your gifts are who you are.
You can't live in fear.

471
00:40:26,574 --> 00:40:28,735
Although a little caution wouldn't hurt.

472
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:38,140
Clark, are you sure
nobody saw you last night?

473
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,586
I'm positive, Mom.

474
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:56,594
Miss Lang, what's this?

475
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:01,331
-It's a news story.
-It's totally unacceptable.

476
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:03,568
Why? It covers all of your criteria.

477
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,212
It deals with a student
and a school-sponsored club...

478
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,008
...and there are no mutants in sight.

479
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,743
Did you do this because you thought
I'd reinstate Miss Sullivan?

480
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,388
I did this
because it's the right thing to do.

481
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,285
Chloe was born for this job.

482
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:20,552
Although I do admire her passion,
her reporting lacks accuracy.

483
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,219
I can work on that.

484
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:28,425
If you want your job back, Miss Sullivan,
don't print what you can't prove.

485
00:41:28,602 --> 00:41:31,628
-Do we have a deal?
-Yeah. Thank you, Principal Kwan.

486
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:36,902
Don't thank me. Thank Miss Lang.

487
00:41:43,484 --> 00:41:45,918
Congratulations. You deserve it.

488
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,644
Thanks.

489
00:41:47,821 --> 00:41:51,279
You know, Lana, I'm sorry I flipped out
at you the other day.

490
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:54,757
I just-- You know, the paper's
kind of my identity...

491
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,329
...and it's the only thing
Clark and I do together.

492
00:41:57,498 --> 00:41:59,090
And so when I saw you here--

493
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,925
You thought I was trying
to cut Clark out of your life?

494
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,832
Nobody ever said I was rational.

495
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:09,041
I want to be friends with you, Chloe...

496
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,576
...but I don't want to stand
between you and Clark.

497
00:42:12,513 --> 00:42:17,109
Oh, no. Don't worry,
there's nothing between us.

498
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,115
We're just good friends.

499
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,782
How about you?

500
00:42:23,857 --> 00:42:27,657
Same thing. We're just friends.

501
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,292
Good. I'm glad we got that out of the way.

502
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:38,132
Now, let's see what you've messed up
since I've been gone.

503
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,889
Lex, are you gonna come to bed?

504
00:42:58,058 --> 00:43:00,219
In a minute.

505
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,216
