1
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,485
Hi, Clark.

2
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,523
Lana. I didn't think anybody else
was out here.

3
00:00:39,394 --> 00:00:42,124
Well, it looks like we had
the same idea for cooling off.

4
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:44,729
Yeah, it's a scorcher.

5
00:00:50,705 --> 00:00:52,764
You know, I'll come back.

6
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:55,136
Oh, no, why? It's a big lake.

7
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,039
There's enough room for both of us.

8
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:01,211
I'm game if you are.

9
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,051
No peeking.

10
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:41,980
Your turn, Clark.

11
00:01:42,157 --> 00:01:43,920
I promise I won't peek.

12
00:02:05,814 --> 00:02:07,076
Clark?

13
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:16,318
Clark!

14
00:02:21,463 --> 00:02:22,930
Boo.

15
00:02:23,765 --> 00:02:25,562
Don't do that.

16
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:34,571
You're...not funny.

17
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:45,678
I always said there should be
nothing between us.

18
00:02:46,388 --> 00:02:47,912
Now there's not.

19
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:53,160
Help!

20
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:56,464
Help me!

21
00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:15,244
What's wrong?

22
00:03:23,124 --> 00:03:25,558
He's here. Run.

23
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:27,194
Run!

24
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:29,560
No!

25
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:33,734
No! Don't let him take me!

26
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:43,437
I dug holes. I used my x-ray vision,
but it's like she just vanished.

27
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:45,698
Was anybody else out there with you?

28
00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:47,808
No. Just me.

29
00:04:48,076 --> 00:04:50,067
You were skinny-dipping alone?

30
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:54,878
Well, it was kind of
a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.

31
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:57,483
All right, son,
I'll give the sheriff a call.

32
00:04:57,719 --> 00:04:59,710
Maybe I should skip school
and look for her.

33
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:03,148
Clark, it's not your
responsibility to save everybody.

34
00:05:03,324 --> 00:05:05,019
Besides...

35
00:05:05,326 --> 00:05:07,590
...right now, we have a surprise for you.

36
00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:09,725
Outside.

37
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:18,734
Wow, I didn't know
you got a new truck.

38
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:21,141
It's not mine, Clark.

39
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:22,571
It's yours.

40
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:25,144
What? Oh, my God.

41
00:05:25,313 --> 00:05:26,575
Wait till I tell Pete.

42
00:05:26,748 --> 00:05:30,514
It's not just for fun, son. We needed
a new truck around here anyway.

43
00:05:30,685 --> 00:05:32,846
Well, how can we afford it?

44
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:35,182
Well, the extra money
Lex gave us came in handy.

45
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:39,917
Considering the source,
I'm surprised you used it.

46
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:43,791
Yeah, I know. But I finally realized
that I wasn't giving him a fair shake.

47
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:47,196
After all you've been through
the last couple of months...

48
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:50,064
...we're really happy to have you home.

49
00:05:51,306 --> 00:05:53,103
I don't know what to say.

50
00:05:53,274 --> 00:05:55,469
Say that you will take good care of her?

51
00:05:56,177 --> 00:05:58,270
I'll take good care of her.

52
00:05:58,947 --> 00:06:00,209
-Thanks.
-All right.

53
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:04,078
You better get to school. If Sheriff Adams
finds out anything about that girl...

54
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:06,413
-...we'll let you know.
-Okay.

55
00:06:31,512 --> 00:06:32,843
Hey, Clark.

56
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:35,273
Lana.

57
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,647
-Look, about yesterday....
-Oh, it's okay.

58
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:40,684
You're not mad?

59
00:06:40,855 --> 00:06:42,948
About you running off?

60
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:45,684
No, I had a good view when you left.

61
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:47,652
So who was screaming?

62
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:50,754
-Some girl.
-ls she okay?

63
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:54,161
I don't know.
She just kind of disappeared.

64
00:06:55,503 --> 00:06:57,471
I'm really sorry I just left you.

65
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,901
Again.

66
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:03,299
Well, it's not like we had a date
or anything.

67
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:04,911
But I had fun.

68
00:07:08,383 --> 00:07:10,317
So did l.

69
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:14,251
Our relationship has always
been about pain and angst.

70
00:07:14,422 --> 00:07:16,390
I guess a little levity is refreshing.

71
00:07:19,127 --> 00:07:22,824
Maybe after a while, you'll stop
torturing yourself and realize...

72
00:07:22,997 --> 00:07:26,160
...that there's no reason
why we shouldn't be together.

73
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,438
It's okay, Clark.

74
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:37,439
I'm willing to wait as long as you want.

75
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:49,814
Hey.

76
00:07:51,426 --> 00:07:54,827
Hey, wait.
Hey, who are you?

77
00:07:55,596 --> 00:07:58,258
What happened? I saw
you get pulled into the ground.

78
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:00,734
At least tell me your name.

79
00:08:01,336 --> 00:08:02,826
Sara.

80
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:04,528
Sara Conroy.

81
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,774
Okay, Sara, what's going on?

82
00:08:08,776 --> 00:08:11,643
-He's after me.
-Who?

83
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:14,479
He's always after me.

84
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:25,651
-Clark. Where were you?
-Pete, did you see that guy?

85
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,521
-What guy?
-How could you miss him?

86
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:31,256
He had a big red cape on.
He was standing right there.

87
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:32,865
Sara, you must--

88
00:08:36,804 --> 00:08:38,101
Who's Sara?

89
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:40,001
She was right there.

90
00:08:40,174 --> 00:08:43,268
The insanity defense.
It's working. I get it.

91
00:08:44,112 --> 00:08:45,807
I'm not insane.

92
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,676
What do you call skipping an exam
worth 50% of your grade?

93
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,182
-That's today?
-That was today.

94
00:08:51,652 --> 00:08:53,210
You flunked.

95
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:02,619
Chloe, I need your help.

96
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:04,697
Something came up
at the lake yesterday.

97
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:06,925
Yeah, I heard.

98
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:09,194
You are referring
to the Blue Lagoon moment...

99
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,964
...with a certain
former girlfriend, right?

100
00:09:12,707 --> 00:09:17,076
-You know about that?
-This is high school. Everybody knows.

101
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:20,577
The only--

102
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:23,640
Did Sara Conroy tell you?

103
00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:26,480
Doubtful, since I've never
met anyone with that name.

104
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:29,389
Well, she's a new student.
I think.

105
00:09:29,624 --> 00:09:32,286
I saw her in the woods,
and I just saw her in the hallway.

106
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,690
She's definitely a candidate
for Wall of Weird.

107
00:09:34,862 --> 00:09:38,320
Well, that's too bad,
since the Wall of Weird has been retired.

108
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:43,868
-Chloe, who did this?
-I did.

109
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:46,737
It's time to leave childish
pursuits behind.

110
00:09:46,908 --> 00:09:48,341
You're not the only one who grew up.

111
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:51,569
Besides, the Daily Planet was beginning
to frown on my obsession.

112
00:09:51,913 --> 00:09:54,279
-But we know these stories are true.
-Do we?

113
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:57,941
-People have died because of that wall.
-And people have been saved too.

114
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:00,078
I'm done chasing windmills, Clark.

115
00:10:00,254 --> 00:10:04,088
From now on, it's hard news
that can be backed up with facts.

116
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:16,429
Lex, your message sounded urgent.

117
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:18,265
Is something wrong?

118
00:10:18,973 --> 00:10:20,941
I'm not really sure.

119
00:10:21,108 --> 00:10:23,235
I'm having a rather strange day.

120
00:10:24,312 --> 00:10:26,075
Join the club.

121
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:29,911
I was hoping you could help me
with a problem, Clark.

122
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:32,482
What do you need?

123
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:35,113
Would you hand me that sword?

124
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:45,860
-ls this new?
-Depends on your definition.

125
00:10:47,468 --> 00:10:52,633
It was a ceremonial weapon used by
a group of 1 6th-century samurai warriors.

126
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:54,331
The Katai.

127
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:55,908
Ever heard of them?

128
00:10:56,978 --> 00:10:59,674
Japanese history
really isn't my strong suit.

129
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:03,174
Let me give you your first lesson.

130
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:10,857
Legend has it this sword was forged
in the fires of Mount Fuji.

131
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,284
The blade can cut through anything.

132
00:11:17,498 --> 00:11:19,659
The Katai never took it into battle.

133
00:11:21,402 --> 00:11:23,063
They never had to.

134
00:11:24,305 --> 00:11:27,638
Till the day the strongest Katai
turned on his own.

135
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:30,870
One by one, the Katai fell at his hand.

136
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,350
Nothing left to lose...

137
00:11:37,518 --> 00:11:40,919
...the last of the Katai lunged
at the warrior with this sword...

138
00:11:42,323 --> 00:11:44,188
...the blade cut him clean in two.

139
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:47,192
But when the warrior's armor fell away...

140
00:11:48,796 --> 00:11:51,560
...the Katai saw he wasn't even human.

141
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:07,810
Just like you, Clark.

142
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,012
See, I've always been honest with you.

143
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:15,883
But it turns out you've been lying to me
from the first day I laid eyes on you.

144
00:12:18,926 --> 00:12:22,225
-No, Lex, I can explain.
-Too late!

145
00:12:23,864 --> 00:12:27,265
The irony is, all you had to do
was come to me, Clark.

146
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:29,867
I was your friend.

147
00:12:30,338 --> 00:12:33,796
I would've protected your secret.
I would've protected you.

148
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:35,840
But I couldn't be trusted.
I'm a Luthor.

149
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,444
-No, that's not it.
-I don't care!

150
00:12:39,313 --> 00:12:41,281
I'm going to dedicate myself
to ensuring...

151
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:43,883
...the whole world knows
who Clark Kent really is.

152
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:46,713
Life as you know it is over.

153
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:53,050
Lex.

154
00:12:54,395 --> 00:12:55,794
Lex!

155
00:13:06,974 --> 00:13:10,307
Mom! Dad! We got a big problem!

156
00:13:14,815 --> 00:13:16,646
Sara?

157
00:13:18,886 --> 00:13:20,217
What are you doing here?

158
00:13:20,388 --> 00:13:24,188
Lilacs. I haven't seen lilacs in years.

159
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:27,452
They're my favorite.
My mother used to grow them for me.

160
00:13:28,696 --> 00:13:30,664
Where is your family?

161
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:33,366
Listen.

162
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:35,766
Please don't let him
take me again.

163
00:13:36,804 --> 00:13:38,066
Who?

164
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,564
The Traveler, Clark.

165
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:43,475
How do you know my name?

166
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:51,978
Sara, you cannot escape me.

167
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:06,132
No matter where you hide,
I will always find you.

168
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:11,471
No! Please! No!

169
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,368
Clark!

170
00:14:20,481 --> 00:14:22,381
No!

171
00:14:27,288 --> 00:14:30,519
Clark. Thank God,
we've been so worried.

172
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:33,318
-What happened?
-You fell asleep...

173
00:14:33,494 --> 00:14:36,054
-...studying for your history exam.
-That was a day ago.

174
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,256
-We've been trying to wake you since.
-You must've been dreaming.

175
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:41,458
It was so real.

176
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:45,727
I met this girl Sara Conroy,
and she was in trouble.

177
00:14:45,906 --> 00:14:48,898
Conroy. That's the name
of our new next-door neighbor.

178
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:51,237
He has a teenage daughter.

179
00:14:51,946 --> 00:14:54,312
They moved into Lana's old house?

180
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:57,007
There's been a moving truck
there since yesterday.

181
00:14:58,452 --> 00:15:01,182
How could I dream about someone
I've never even met?

182
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:25,703
Wow.

183
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,747
-Somebody's sure up early.
-Clark, have you been up all night?

184
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,680
I was kind of afraid to go to sleep.

185
00:15:31,852 --> 00:15:33,945
I can't get over
how real that dream was.

186
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:36,851
-I feel like checking on the Conroys.
-What would you say?

187
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:39,322
-Sara was in danger in your dreams?
-Be careful.

188
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:43,020
-Yeah. I gotta be careful when I'm sleeping.
-You weren't just asleep, son.

189
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:44,459
You were out for 36 hours.

190
00:15:44,632 --> 00:15:47,999
That just happens to coincide
with that girl moving in next door?

191
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:50,865
-You think she's keeping me asleep?
-I don't know, Clark.

192
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:53,939
But with all the weird things going on,
you need to be careful.

193
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:58,067
So, look, I'm asking you,
you stay away from the neighbors.

194
00:16:07,922 --> 00:16:10,220
Missed you at school
the last few days.

195
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:15,186
I haven't been feeling so good.

196
00:16:16,163 --> 00:16:18,154
To be honest,
you look a little tired.

197
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:20,163
-Maybe you should get some sleep.
-No.

198
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:25,270
-I'll be fine.
-Okay.

199
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:30,409
Well, I brought you your homework.

200
00:16:30,578 --> 00:16:33,240
Mr. Blair said that you could
make up your history exam...

201
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:36,212
...as long as you have
a note from your parents.

202
00:16:37,451 --> 00:16:38,884
You're the best.

203
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,718
-Can I tell you something?
-Sure.

204
00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:53,926
I had this dream,
and it's really freaking me out.

205
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:55,591
What was it about?

206
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:58,329
A lot of things. This girl.

207
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:02,539
No, Lana, it's not like that.

208
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,837
She needed help.

209
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:07,344
Let me guess.
You had to save her.

210
00:17:07,514 --> 00:17:09,243
Except I couldn't.

211
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,941
Her name's Sara,
and she moved into your old house.

212
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,611
-When did you meet her?
-That's the thing. I haven't.

213
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:17,916
How could I be dreaming about her?

214
00:17:19,894 --> 00:17:21,885
Maybe if you walked me
through the dream...

215
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:24,121
...we could figure it out together.

216
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:25,731
You don't think I'm nuts?

217
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:29,698
Clark, I think you have a lot of issues...

218
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,839
...but I do not think
you have lost your mind.

219
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:38,909
-Okay, so where did you see her first?
-Crater Lake.

220
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:42,913
-You were there.
-Really? What were we doing?

221
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,017
Nothing.

222
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:47,676
It's really hazy.

223
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:52,217
Okay. Well, I have a better idea.

224
00:17:52,393 --> 00:17:55,123
Why don't we go see Sara in person?

225
00:18:07,107 --> 00:18:09,098
Wow, she seemed so....

226
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:15,841
Do the doctors
think she'll come out of it?

227
00:18:16,016 --> 00:18:17,950
Well, there's always hope.

228
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:25,319
It must be really hard
to see your daughter like this.

229
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:27,483
Oh, Sara's my niece.

230
00:18:28,095 --> 00:18:31,258
So this is your old house, Lana.

231
00:18:32,132 --> 00:18:35,124
And you're the boy from next door.

232
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:36,792
-What exactly happened?
-Clark.

233
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:39,565
It's okay. It's no secret.

234
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,332
It was a car accident.

235
00:18:41,508 --> 00:18:43,806
Sara and her parents
went off the Loeb Bridge...

236
00:18:43,978 --> 00:18:46,208
...on their way home
from a soccer game.

237
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,714
The paramedics say Sara was asleep,
which is probably why she survived.

238
00:18:51,085 --> 00:18:53,781
-Sara's from Smallville?
-Grandville.

239
00:18:53,954 --> 00:18:55,717
Just over the county line.

240
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:58,483
Lilacs. Those are Sara's favorite.

241
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:02,460
Yes.

242
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:06,029
How did you know that?

243
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:09,060
They're my favorite too.

244
00:19:09,236 --> 00:19:12,171
It must be kismet,
living in the same house.

245
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:22,974
That's an interesting medal.

246
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:24,846
This?

247
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:29,750
-Well, it's just good old St. Christopher.
-The patron saint of travelers, right?

248
00:19:30,591 --> 00:19:34,925
Yes, I say his prayer every night
in the hopes that Sara's journey will end...

249
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:37,655
...and she'll come back to us.

250
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:42,761
Look, I'm sorry.
You'll have to excuse me.

251
00:19:42,936 --> 00:19:45,268
It's time for Sara's medication.

252
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:48,968
Thank you for stopping by.

253
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:12,692
Dad, I thought I made it clear...

254
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:16,427
...that I'm back, fully committed
to LuthorCorp and to you.

255
00:20:16,603 --> 00:20:18,662
And I'm delighted...

256
00:20:20,374 --> 00:20:22,171
...to hear it.

257
00:20:26,146 --> 00:20:28,637
Now, what's the problem?

258
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:32,547
I've been blocked out of half
the computer files I need to do my job.

259
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:34,846
Insufficient security clearance?

260
00:20:36,857 --> 00:20:38,449
Thank you, Meli.

261
00:20:42,563 --> 00:20:43,860
These...

262
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:50,300
...security measures, Lex, are a necessary
evil. You should know that.

263
00:20:51,004 --> 00:20:53,529
-We have to protect our assets.
-From me?

264
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:57,571
I applaud your renewed commitment
to LuthorCorp.

265
00:20:57,744 --> 00:21:02,044
After what you've been through,
it's remarkable.

266
00:21:02,216 --> 00:21:04,810
But you think I might betray you again.

267
00:21:06,553 --> 00:21:09,249
Betray me?
That's an interesting notion.

268
00:21:10,891 --> 00:21:12,518
Might you?

269
00:21:14,995 --> 00:21:16,758
I want this to work.

270
00:21:18,365 --> 00:21:20,333
I want us to be a family again.

271
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:23,061
You have nothing to fear from me.

272
00:21:24,505 --> 00:21:28,168
Why have you refused to complete
the psychological profile?

273
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:32,808
Come on, Dad. You've never believed
in that psychobabble, and neither do l.

274
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,110
I believe that personal,
emotional problems...

275
00:21:37,284 --> 00:21:39,411
...may affect day-to-day decision-making.

276
00:21:39,586 --> 00:21:44,546
I think that dreams can often reveal
hidden dangers, serve as a warning--

277
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:46,488
Spare me the Jungian cliff notes, Dad.

278
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,958
It's five sessions, Lex. That's all.

279
00:21:49,963 --> 00:21:52,932
I thought you wanted
to reestablish our bond.

280
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:55,399
I do.

281
00:21:55,569 --> 00:22:01,201
Then do it. Prove that my total
confidence in you is justified.

282
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,448
Clark Kent dreaming of the girl next door.

283
00:22:08,615 --> 00:22:10,742
Isn't it nice to know
some things never change?

284
00:22:10,918 --> 00:22:12,545
Now I'm just trying to stay awake.

285
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:17,088
Yeah, even Red Bull has its limits.
Trust me. I've tested them.

286
00:22:17,257 --> 00:22:20,090
I think Sara's reaching out
to me for help.

287
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,160
Entering your dreams to communicate?

288
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:26,163
How else would I know these details
of her life? Like the lilacs.

289
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:29,894
There is a theory that telepathic
receptivity is increased during REM sleep.

290
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,935
It has to do with frontal lobe activity.

291
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:34,437
My frontal lobe is acting as a beacon.

292
00:22:34,608 --> 00:22:38,408
Well, I've never seen a case this dramatic,
but we all know that your brain...

293
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:41,309
...is wired a little differently
than the rest of ours.

294
00:22:41,481 --> 00:22:45,417
Add that the river where she crashed
is a source for our favorite green stuff...

295
00:22:45,586 --> 00:22:48,851
...and you have the perfect Smallville
cocktail for weirdness.

296
00:22:49,022 --> 00:22:51,684
You think the meteor rocks
gave her this ability.

297
00:22:51,858 --> 00:22:53,655
Once she's in, she can keep you asleep.

298
00:22:53,827 --> 00:22:57,627
It certainly explains
the day-and-a-half snore-a-thon.

299
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:00,892
I didn't wake up
until the Traveler appeared.

300
00:23:01,702 --> 00:23:02,930
And I think it's her uncle.

301
00:23:03,103 --> 00:23:05,663
Or a manifestation of fear
that she has for her uncle.

302
00:23:08,075 --> 00:23:11,101
Sorry. I didn't mean to get
all Freudian on you.

303
00:23:11,778 --> 00:23:14,941
No. Her uncle is all-powerful in her life.

304
00:23:15,115 --> 00:23:18,516
-Why wouldn't he be in her dreams?
-You're not buying the altruism angle?

305
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:22,380
My faith in human kindness
is not what it used to be.

306
00:23:22,556 --> 00:23:26,322
Wanna go to the courthouse to see what
public records say about Uncle Nicholas?

307
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:28,484
I have a deadline for the Daily Planet.

308
00:23:28,662 --> 00:23:31,722
And a Wall of Weird story doesn't
take precedence in their mind.

309
00:23:31,898 --> 00:23:34,765
-No time for childish pursuits anymore.
-Hey, that's not fair.

310
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:36,527
You know that if I had a choice...

311
00:23:36,703 --> 00:23:40,161
...I would definitely be down there
pulling dusty records with you.

312
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,604
I doubt that.
It's okay, I'll grab Lana.

313
00:23:42,776 --> 00:23:46,109
Yeah, at least she can provide
a constant source of caffeine.

314
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,650
Now I know why
public records are public.

315
00:24:01,828 --> 00:24:03,455
They're incredibly boring.

316
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,222
Not all of them.

317
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:07,367
Take a look at this.

318
00:24:08,602 --> 00:24:11,366
Wow. Sara's parents were rich.

319
00:24:11,538 --> 00:24:13,403
When they died,
she inherited everything.

320
00:24:13,573 --> 00:24:15,768
One guess who's in control of the money.

321
00:24:15,942 --> 00:24:17,432
Uncle Nicholas.

322
00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:22,144
As long as she stays in a coma,
he controls the wealth.

323
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,415
But he still hasn't done anything wrong.

324
00:24:25,585 --> 00:24:30,045
I mean, taking care of your niece and living
a nice life isn't exactly a smoking gun.

325
00:24:30,223 --> 00:24:32,714
Then why is Sara so scared of him?

326
00:24:32,893 --> 00:24:36,556
-I just don't get it.
-Hey, you're tired.

327
00:24:37,631 --> 00:24:39,997
I'm afraid to close my eyes.

328
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:43,663
I'll go put on another pot of coffee.

329
00:24:46,506 --> 00:24:48,269
You don't have to stay.

330
00:24:49,443 --> 00:24:51,001
I want to, Clark.

331
00:25:10,897 --> 00:25:12,489
That was fast.

332
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:16,029
-Sara.
-Hi.

333
00:25:17,671 --> 00:25:19,298
I must've fallen asleep.

334
00:25:20,107 --> 00:25:23,304
-Yeah.
-How do you get into my dreams?

335
00:25:24,444 --> 00:25:26,241
I don't know, Clark.

336
00:25:26,413 --> 00:25:29,473
This has never happened to me before.
I mean, just the other day...

337
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:34,677
...suddenly I was in the woods and then
at school and then at your house....

338
00:25:34,855 --> 00:25:38,382
I realized what happened when
you and Lana came to see me.

339
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:40,458
You can hear us?

340
00:25:41,228 --> 00:25:44,823
Yeah. It's like being
in a long, dark tunnel.

341
00:25:44,998 --> 00:25:48,900
I mean, sometimes it's open,
but sometimes it's not.

342
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:50,900
I tried to reach out to you.

343
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:54,006
You don't know what it's like
to be locked in your own body...

344
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:56,074
...never any contact.

345
00:25:58,145 --> 00:26:00,613
Sara, who's the Traveler?

346
00:26:00,781 --> 00:26:03,909
Oh, we shouldn't talk about him.
He'll find us.

347
00:26:04,584 --> 00:26:05,846
Is it your uncle?

348
00:26:07,587 --> 00:26:10,579
Why are you so afraid of him?
What does he do to you?

349
00:26:10,757 --> 00:26:14,625
I don't know. I used to be able
to hear the doctors talking...

350
00:26:14,795 --> 00:26:16,922
...and they said I should've woken up.

351
00:26:17,097 --> 00:26:21,124
But every time I do feel just
a little bit better, he does something...

352
00:26:21,301 --> 00:26:23,792
...and I get sent back to a deep,
dark place...

353
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,767
...that's like the bottom of the ocean.

354
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,267
I almost woke up once.

355
00:26:29,643 --> 00:26:32,077
That's when he moved us here.

356
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:34,770
Sara....

357
00:26:34,948 --> 00:26:36,779
God, he's here.

358
00:26:52,866 --> 00:26:54,766
Interesting theory, Clark.

359
00:26:54,935 --> 00:26:57,199
I know it sounds crazy,
but that's what happened.

360
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,736
Now you're saving people
in your dreams too.

361
00:26:59,906 --> 00:27:01,806
A shrink would have
a field day with that.

362
00:27:01,975 --> 00:27:04,170
-You don't believe me?
-I believe you believe it...

363
00:27:04,344 --> 00:27:06,107
...and that's enough for me.

364
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:10,272
You'll have to forgive me. I have
a personal bias against psychotherapy.

365
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,918
You don't like
letting people in your head.

366
00:27:13,086 --> 00:27:14,348
Something like that.

367
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:17,684
Well, this girl's in my head
until I figure out a way to help her.

368
00:27:17,858 --> 00:27:20,349
I made a few calls to Metropolis General.

369
00:27:20,527 --> 00:27:22,586
It's true. Sara was supposed to wake up.

370
00:27:22,762 --> 00:27:25,322
So her uncle is drugging her.

371
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:27,558
They didn't have evidence of foul play...

372
00:27:27,734 --> 00:27:30,202
...but they've only performed
routine blood tests.

373
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,431
Maybe the drug's untraceable.

374
00:27:32,606 --> 00:27:34,597
It doesn't appear
he's done anything wrong.

375
00:27:34,774 --> 00:27:37,709
We both know appearances
can be deceiving, Lex.

376
00:27:37,878 --> 00:27:40,176
Hearing it in a dream
won't get him arrested.

377
00:27:40,347 --> 00:27:42,144
I appreciate your help.

378
00:27:42,315 --> 00:27:43,782
Anytime.

379
00:27:48,622 --> 00:27:50,419
I always liked this sword.

380
00:27:51,124 --> 00:27:55,584
What is it, some sort of legendary
samurai antique?

381
00:27:55,762 --> 00:28:00,961
Hardly. It's a prop
from my favorite Kurosawa movie.

382
00:28:01,935 --> 00:28:03,527
Throne of Blood.

383
00:28:03,904 --> 00:28:05,838
I bought it at auction.

384
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,606
Relax, Clark.
It can't hurt you.

385
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,212
It's not real.

386
00:28:15,148 --> 00:28:16,775
Right.

387
00:28:17,617 --> 00:28:20,882
You've got to learn the difference
between reality and fantasy.

388
00:28:23,123 --> 00:28:24,750
Get some sleep.

389
00:28:31,731 --> 00:28:34,495
Clark. This is a pleasant surprise.

390
00:28:35,335 --> 00:28:38,065
I thought I'd bring Sara
some fresh flowers.

391
00:28:39,172 --> 00:28:40,537
Come in.

392
00:28:47,847 --> 00:28:49,678
This is real nice of you, Clark.

393
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,048
Would you mind
if I sit with her for a while?

394
00:28:54,554 --> 00:28:56,249
Not at all.

395
00:29:00,894 --> 00:29:03,226
Can I get you something to drink?

396
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,664
Anything with caffeine.

397
00:29:05,832 --> 00:29:07,823
I think I might have some soda.

398
00:30:04,758 --> 00:30:07,056
-Clark.
-Sara.

399
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:09,888
He's so angry.

400
00:30:11,965 --> 00:30:15,765
Wait, if you're here, that means I'm....

401
00:30:37,957 --> 00:30:40,824
-Hello?
-Lana, hi. Come on in.

402
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:43,061
I was looking for Clark.

403
00:30:43,229 --> 00:30:44,628
I brought him a pick-me-up.

404
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:48,029
He's not back from Lex's,
but you're welcome to wait.

405
00:30:48,201 --> 00:30:49,463
Thanks.

406
00:30:51,638 --> 00:30:55,335
-So you finally have new neighbors.
-Yeah, not as good as the old ones.

407
00:30:58,178 --> 00:31:00,669
Mrs. Kent, could I ask you something?

408
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:02,712
Of course, Lana.

409
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,559
Do you know why
Clark pushed me away?

410
00:31:18,164 --> 00:31:20,359
Metropolis changed Clark.

411
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:25,235
He's not the same boy he was
when he left this spring.

412
00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:27,566
Jonathan and I are trying
to figure it out too.

413
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:31,268
I guess I just feel like...

414
00:31:31,678 --> 00:31:34,340
...if I stay in his orbit long enough...

415
00:31:34,514 --> 00:31:37,642
...he'll finally decide to open up.

416
00:31:39,252 --> 00:31:42,653
Martha! Come quick, it's Clark!

417
00:31:49,095 --> 00:31:50,619
Oh, my God!

418
00:31:50,797 --> 00:31:52,230
Jonathan!

419
00:31:53,266 --> 00:31:56,235
-What happened?
-He must've fallen asleep at the wheel.

420
00:31:56,402 --> 00:31:57,699
I'll call an ambulance.

421
00:31:57,871 --> 00:32:00,066
No, I think he just hit his head.
He'll be fine.

422
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,175
Where was he coming from?
Lex's mansion is the other way.

423
00:32:03,343 --> 00:32:06,471
Oh, Clark, I told you
not to go to the Conroys.

424
00:32:06,646 --> 00:32:09,513
He was worried about Sara.
He kept seeing her in his dreams.

425
00:32:09,682 --> 00:32:11,115
It's my fault.
I took him there.

426
00:32:11,284 --> 00:32:15,186
Sweetie, don't blame yourself.
Clark will be fine.

427
00:32:15,688 --> 00:32:19,249
-What about Sara?
-I'm worried about her too.

428
00:32:32,305 --> 00:32:33,567
Sara, wait!

429
00:32:38,411 --> 00:32:41,073
-Sara!
-No!

430
00:32:41,414 --> 00:32:44,611
-We have to get away from him!
-You can't keep running.

431
00:32:45,785 --> 00:32:48,583
-I just want to be free!
-You can.

432
00:32:48,755 --> 00:32:51,656
In the real world.
You just have to face him.

433
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,593
-I'm afraid.
-Sara, you're keeping us in this dream.

434
00:32:56,763 --> 00:32:59,960
I can't help you until I wake up.
I have no power.

435
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:02,067
I'm sorry, Clark.

436
00:33:05,071 --> 00:33:06,333
Sara!

437
00:33:21,821 --> 00:33:24,585
How did he know about this?

438
00:33:25,992 --> 00:33:28,460
How did he know about the lilacs?

439
00:33:31,097 --> 00:33:35,158
I don't know what's going on
in there, but it's gonna stop.

440
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,504
Don't put that needle in her.

441
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,777
How did you get in here?

442
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:49,413
We know you've been drugging Sara.

443
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:51,282
Really.

444
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:56,580
You and your boyfriend are a little
too neighborly for your own good.

445
00:33:56,756 --> 00:33:59,020
if you kill her, there's no more money.

446
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:02,056
Who said anything about killing her?

447
00:34:29,822 --> 00:34:31,221
Sara, are you okay?

448
00:34:31,391 --> 00:34:33,518
I'm all right, Clark.

449
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:35,320
She's in trouble.

450
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:38,962
-Who?
-Lana.

451
00:34:44,504 --> 00:34:46,028
No.

452
00:35:01,721 --> 00:35:06,715
I warned you, Sara.
This is a fight you'll never win.

453
00:35:06,893 --> 00:35:09,191
-It's too late.
-Sara, we have to save Lana.

454
00:35:09,362 --> 00:35:12,490
He's too strong.
You can't stop him.

455
00:35:16,502 --> 00:35:18,993
Death will follow those who trespass.

456
00:35:19,172 --> 00:35:21,538
Sara! You have to help me!

457
00:35:28,081 --> 00:35:31,448
Sara, you cannot escape me.

458
00:35:32,785 --> 00:35:34,878
-Return with me.
-No.

459
00:35:35,054 --> 00:35:37,488
You're stronger than he is, Sara.
You know you are.

460
00:35:37,657 --> 00:35:39,124
-He cannot save you.
-Fight it!

461
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:41,192
He did this to you.

462
00:35:41,361 --> 00:35:45,320
-Get angry. He took six years of your life.
-I control your destiny, Sara.

463
00:35:45,498 --> 00:35:49,298
Close your eyes
and return to your slumber.

464
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:51,403
Don't be afraid, Sara.

465
00:35:52,338 --> 00:35:56,832
The more you resist, Sara,
the more you will suffer.

466
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:59,808
I will not warn you again.

467
00:36:13,926 --> 00:36:15,450
Clark.

468
00:36:15,628 --> 00:36:17,687
Mom. Lana' s in trouble.

469
00:36:31,611 --> 00:36:32,600
Lana.

470
00:37:05,978 --> 00:37:07,639
Looking for this?

471
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,594
Lex?

472
00:37:33,406 --> 00:37:35,237
What's so urgent?

473
00:37:35,408 --> 00:37:37,876
-I decided to do it.
-Do what?

474
00:37:39,112 --> 00:37:43,742
Meet with the psychiatrist,
submit to a full battery of mental tests.

475
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:45,508
Curious.

476
00:37:46,786 --> 00:37:48,378
Tell me, what changed your mind?

477
00:37:48,554 --> 00:37:51,250
Because I was dealing
from a position of fear.

478
00:37:51,424 --> 00:37:54,951
If there's one thing you can sniff
out like a bloodhound, it's that.

479
00:37:55,128 --> 00:37:58,359
It's a gift, Lex, and it's useful.

480
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,627
I know the only way I'm gonna
prove to you that I'm your rightful heir...

481
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:07,364
...is to deal from a position of strength.

482
00:38:07,773 --> 00:38:09,070
I have nothing to hide.

483
00:38:11,744 --> 00:38:13,405
That would mean a lot to me, son.

484
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:18,612
I figured, you're my father, and you
only have my best interests at heart.

485
00:38:18,784 --> 00:38:21,082
-Who's the good doctor?
-Claire Foster.

486
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:25,691
Highly credentialed.
She's published a couple of books.

487
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:28,588
She'll be able to help you
work through any problems.

488
00:38:31,197 --> 00:38:35,531
-That island didn't make me crazy, Dad.
-Crazy? No.

489
00:38:35,701 --> 00:38:37,635
Of course not.

490
00:38:40,173 --> 00:38:43,438
But it'll be good to have that
in writing, won't it?

491
00:38:49,348 --> 00:38:50,713
Lex.

492
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:57,152
When you're rich, you're not crazy.

493
00:38:57,323 --> 00:38:58,915
You're eccentric.

494
00:39:22,782 --> 00:39:25,580
-Hi, Sara, how you doing?
-Hi.

495
00:39:28,187 --> 00:39:31,588
I brought you some fresh lilacs.
I know they're your favorite.

496
00:39:33,793 --> 00:39:35,852
It's Clark, isn't it?

497
00:39:36,262 --> 00:39:38,093
I didn't think you'd remember me.

498
00:39:38,264 --> 00:39:41,461
Yeah. We've been through
so much together...

499
00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:44,569
...even though we've never officially met.

500
00:39:44,737 --> 00:39:47,297
I still don't know
how I got in your dreams.

501
00:39:47,707 --> 00:39:50,801
The important thing is, you're safe.
And you're awake.

502
00:39:52,144 --> 00:39:54,942
You're obviously a special guy.

503
00:39:56,315 --> 00:39:59,443
I saw some of the things
you're able to do.

504
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,186
Well, in our dreams, we're all super.

505
00:40:03,356 --> 00:40:04,618
I just....

506
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:09,488
I know it's none of my business.
I know dreams are usually private.

507
00:40:10,696 --> 00:40:12,323
No.

508
00:40:16,435 --> 00:40:18,869
I'm curious to hear your perspective.

509
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:21,132
What did you see?

510
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:24,600
Someone who's clearly in love...

511
00:40:24,777 --> 00:40:26,938
...but who resists it.

512
00:40:27,713 --> 00:40:29,613
Lana, right?

513
00:40:33,786 --> 00:40:37,620
Clark, take it from someone
who's been trapped for six years.

514
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:41,248
If you love her that much,
don't push her away.

515
00:40:43,362 --> 00:40:46,092
It's a long and complicated story, Sara.

516
00:40:46,265 --> 00:40:48,893
I only know what I saw.

517
00:40:49,068 --> 00:40:51,468
I may have been there...

518
00:40:53,506 --> 00:40:56,066
...but Lana's the girl of your dreams.

519
00:41:11,257 --> 00:41:13,521
Burning the midnight oil?

520
00:41:13,693 --> 00:41:18,027
I finally got some sleep.
My makeup history exam is tomorrow.

521
00:41:18,197 --> 00:41:22,463
-How are you feeling?
-Pretty stupid.

522
00:41:22,635 --> 00:41:24,102
Why?

523
00:41:24,537 --> 00:41:27,028
What you did was really brave.
You saved Sara's life.

524
00:41:27,206 --> 00:41:29,731
Yeah, and it almost cost me mine.

525
00:41:29,909 --> 00:41:31,433
It's lucky you got there.

526
00:41:32,278 --> 00:41:34,838
You believed in me when I thought
I was losing my mind.

527
00:41:35,014 --> 00:41:37,175
It was the least I could do.

528
00:41:38,551 --> 00:41:41,918
So I finally met Sara.

529
00:41:43,155 --> 00:41:45,589
All she could talk about was you.

530
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:48,589
I told her I'd love to switch places.

531
00:41:48,761 --> 00:41:51,423
You know, find out what goes on
inside your head.

532
00:41:51,597 --> 00:41:53,224
It's not that exciting.

533
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:57,667
Still, you know, maybe it would explain
why things between us....

534
00:41:58,738 --> 00:42:01,764
Lana, if I had the answers up here,
you'd be the first to know.

535
00:42:02,742 --> 00:42:06,838
You know, it's just the last few days
I felt like the girl next door again.

536
00:42:07,012 --> 00:42:08,479
And it was nice.

537
00:42:10,483 --> 00:42:12,451
Even though it almost got you killed?

538
00:42:16,489 --> 00:42:17,979
Lana.

539
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:21,282
You'll always be the girl next door.

540
00:42:28,367 --> 00:42:31,598
So any chance we could
do something this weekend?

541
00:42:31,771 --> 00:42:33,170
You know, as friends?

542
00:42:34,273 --> 00:42:35,706
What did you have in mind?

543
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:38,866
Well, it's been like an oven outside...

544
00:42:39,044 --> 00:42:42,343
...so I was thinking we could
go swimming at Crater Lake.

545
00:42:43,549 --> 00:42:47,280
I really don't think
skinny-dipping is a good idea.

546
00:42:49,021 --> 00:42:51,512
Who said anything
about skinny-dipping?

547
00:42:55,261 --> 00:42:57,752
Maybe in your dreams, Clark.

548
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
