1
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,994
You're putting a lot of time into
this equestrian show.

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,763
I didn't realize its importance.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,535
I'm inviting the Smalls to come watch me
ride in this weekend's competition.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,202
Oh. Well, I take it everything's good
on the father-daughter front.

5
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,906
Actually, they're great.

6
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,547
Well, this could actually work out, then.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,419
Let's just say I'm cautiously optimistic.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,286
I keep living my life
waiting for the other shoe to drop.

9
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,620
You deserve to be happy.

10
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,930
Thanks, Clark.

11
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,999
Clark, what happened to you?

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,367
Story deadline...?

13
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:44,910
- Stop me when I'm getting warm.
- My article about the debate team. Chloe...

14
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,342
...I'm really sorry.
I got caught up helping Lana.

15
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,573
I'll get it to you first thing tomorrow.

16
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,944
Well, unfortunately, Clark,
I needed it tonight.

17
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:55,576
To fill in the hole, I had to blow up
the lunch menu to a 60-point type.

18
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:59,156
- I'm sure that'll be fascinating.
- Chloe, it's my fault.

19
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:02,783
- I asked Clark to help me.
- No, Lana, I don't blame you.

20
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,962
Well, I'm gonna go lock up in the back.

21
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:12,127
- Thanks again for your help.
- Yeah.

22
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,005
Chloe, I'll make it up to you. I promise.

23
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:21,079
I can't say that makes me feel any better,
given your track record on promises.

24
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,315
It's one story, what's the big deal?

25
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,509
That you couldn't give up
one riding practice to do.

26
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:30,247
- Don't make this about Lana.
- I'm not. This is about you.

27
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,449
And your perennial inability
to be there when I need you.

28
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:36,789
- Don't you think you're being a little harsh?
- No. I don't.

29
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:41,324
I'm never a priority in your life, I'm always
just your backup plan and I'm tired of it.

30
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,163
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

31
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,466
If that's the way you feel,
maybe I should quit.

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,130
Maybe you should.

33
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,471
Fine. I quit.

34
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,299
Help me get this stuff out of the back!

35
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,944
Right.

36
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,820
Hey!

37
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:12,391
- What do you think you're doing?
- Get out of here!

38
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,992
Hey!

39
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,597
Hurry up, dude. Hurry up.

40
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,073
Okay, let's go. Let's go!

41
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,173
I got it. I got it.

42
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,748
- How could they do it?
- What, beat the crap out of me?

43
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,747
I'm sorry, Dad, it just... It hurt.

44
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:49,113
It actually hurt.

45
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:52,119
- What'd you tell the police?
- I left beforehand.

46
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,020
You witnessed a crime.
You have an obligation to report it.

47
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:58,128
And put myself back on
Sheriff Adams' radar? I don't think so.

48
00:04:58,396 --> 00:05:01,297
What could I tell her,
I used my x-ray vision to see the plate?

49
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:04,663
All right, I understand. Just calm down,
what else did you see?

50
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:08,270
He was wearing a class ring.

51
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:11,068
I think he goes to Smallville High.

52
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:20,349
Just because he has a class ring
doesn't necessarily mean he goes here.

53
00:05:20,518 --> 00:05:23,487
I mean, he could be a graduate.

54
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:30,594
Meanwhile, in Lana-land,
looks like your ship's finally come in.

55
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:33,526
- Oh, I mean, we're...
- "Just friends."

56
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:37,099
You better invest in a new set of cue cards.
I've never seen her so happy.

57
00:05:37,268 --> 00:05:41,932
Well, I wish it was just me, but Lana's been
walking on air since her dad stepped up.

58
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,170
Pete, who's that guy?

59
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:51,747
You mean Eric Marsh?

60
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,384
You really need to pick up a sports page.

61
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,958
All right, Eric, show us what you got.

62
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,201
Let's go, Eric. Step up.

63
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:15,066
All right, give me some heat.

64
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,772
- Nice swing.
- Yeah.

65
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:27,111
Eric's got the highest batting average
in Smallville High history.

66
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:29,446
He really put the team on the map.

67
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:33,580
Rumor has it they're getting sponsorship
for equipment and uniforms because of him.

68
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:37,785
Not to mention the scouts that have
suddenly added a detour to Smallville.

69
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:39,953
Funny thing, though...

70
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:42,232
...he used to suck.

71
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,958
What do you mean?

72
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:46,933
We played on the same
Little League team for five years.

73
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:49,437
He was always a benchwarmer.

74
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:51,404
When did he go from zero to hero?

75
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,407
Not sure.

76
00:06:53,578 --> 00:06:55,978
Sometimes you work hard enough,
you get your dream.

77
00:06:56,147 --> 00:06:58,809
Or he's under some
pharmaceutical enhancement.

78
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:00,914
You thinking steroids?

79
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:04,012
Right now, I don't know what to think.

80
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:34,512
Lex.

81
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:39,981
It's been too long.

82
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:43,792
And I thought we agreed to keep
face-to-face contact to a minimum.

83
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:46,453
For business, perhaps. This is a social call.

84
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:49,998
I've come to offer my congratulations
on your engagement.

85
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:52,636
Though I admit, I...

86
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:55,568
It hurt that I had to learn
of your pending nuptials...

87
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,039
...via the gossip pages of the Inquisitor.

88
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:00,505
Come on, Dad.

89
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:05,138
Since when has my personal happiness
ever been of the slightest interest to you?

90
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:08,048
And where is...

91
00:08:08,686 --> 00:08:11,246
- Helen?
...Helen.

92
00:08:11,956 --> 00:08:14,447
Helen's out of town at a medical seminar.

93
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:18,995
I suspect your visit would be putting her
anger management techniques to the test.

94
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:25,234
But then we both know you're not here
to discuss my wedding plans.

95
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,935
Oh, what is this?

96
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,309
Oh, Lex, I'm surprised that you would...

97
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:35,446
...put stock in the reportage
of a high-school newspaper.

98
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:38,175
I usually don't...

99
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,080
...but I did some checking of my own
and Io and behold, it's true.

100
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:46,050
What are you moving in the middle
of the night in unmarked trucks?

101
00:08:46,324 --> 00:08:47,757
Nothing out of the ordinary.

102
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:55,426
I'd hate to think that you'd stoop to use
common thuggery to get back at me, son.

103
00:08:57,368 --> 00:08:59,268
Wait a minute.

104
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:03,764
Are you insinuating that I had something
to do with robbing your truck?

105
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:05,666
Dad.

106
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:07,071
That would be illegal.

107
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:11,045
Legalities are inconsequential.
I would want my property returned.

108
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:15,377
For what it's worth...

109
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:20,354
...I had nothing to do with it. But the fact
that you came this far to ask intrigues me.

110
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:24,522
What's in there that's so important to you?

111
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,337
Give my regards to...

112
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:37,799
...your fiancee.

113
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:48,413
Enjoy.

114
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:51,415
Henry. This is a surprise.

115
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:53,113
Well, I was in the neighborhood.

116
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:57,057
Regular coffee, no additives. And when
you come by three times a week...

117
00:09:57,228 --> 00:09:58,695
...you don't need the excuse.

118
00:09:59,897 --> 00:10:03,628
I guess some small part of me
is still getting used to all this.

119
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:06,998
What, dropping by for a casual visit
with your daughter?

120
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:12,666
No, entering a business co-owned
by Luthor without an injunction in my hand.

121
00:10:15,113 --> 00:10:17,377
Thanks. But it's been worth it.

122
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:20,312
I feel the same way.

123
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,987
- What's this?
- The seating chart for this weekend's show.

124
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:27,852
They set aside a section
for riders' families.

125
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:31,325
I took a leap and reserved
a couple of seats for you and Jennifer.

126
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:33,660
Lana, that was thoughtful.

127
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:35,458
Yes, I'll definitely be there.

128
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,665
But Jennifer won't.

129
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:42,332
She's never really accepted me, has she?

130
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,104
She just doesn't know you like I do.

131
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:47,369
Give her some time, she'll come around.

132
00:10:54,952 --> 00:10:57,944
Pete, check this out.
Before Eric's sudden sports career...

133
00:10:58,122 --> 00:11:01,455
...he was an honors chemistry student
with a straight-A average.

134
00:11:01,993 --> 00:11:04,723
Guess you don't get the babes
and the free Nikes for that.

135
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:07,228
It says here he was in
a chemistry lab explosion...

136
00:11:07,398 --> 00:11:10,333
...at Kansas State University
last summer during chemistry camp.

137
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:13,231
That's probably why
he's got the plate in his head.

138
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:16,430
Yeah, but what's he doing
knocking over a LuthorCorp truck?

139
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:18,773
I thought you quit the Torch.

140
00:11:18,943 --> 00:11:20,501
Just clearing out my desk.

141
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:22,669
Wait a minute, you quit?

142
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:25,274
Apparently I can't be counted on.

143
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:28,815
I didn't even know quitting was an option.

144
00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:30,317
Funny.

145
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:34,825
Tough crowd.
Hey, I'll catch up with you later.

146
00:11:34,992 --> 00:11:37,426
- Keep me posted on Eric.
- Yeah.

147
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,657
Marsh? Why are you guys interested in him?

148
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:46,492
Doesn't matter.

149
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:49,705
Clark, I didn't ask you to quit the Torch.

150
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:52,240
Yeah, but all I do is disappoint you.

151
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,638
I didn't say that.

152
00:11:53,811 --> 00:11:58,441
I just said it seems like you drop everything
for Lana with no regard for anyone else.

153
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:00,446
I thought this wasn't about Lana.

154
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:02,210
It's not.

155
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:05,320
- It's not.
- Every time you see us together...

156
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,254
...you look at me like I'm cheating on you.

157
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,458
I'm sorry, but if that's the way you feel...

158
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:13,529
...maybe we shouldn't hang out anymore.

159
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,166
Tell me it's working, boys.

160
00:12:57,608 --> 00:12:59,075
This stuff's incredible.

161
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:01,734
Another score
and we'll take it out on the street.

162
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:04,245
Yep, as long as there's enough for me.

163
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:07,042
I got a major league scout
coming to watch me next week.

164
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:09,982
Then you can make the next batch, champ.

165
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:48,325
- Who do we have here?
- Hold him.

166
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:52,652
You're not going anywhere.

167
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,496
Were you following me, Kent?

168
00:13:57,902 --> 00:13:59,597
I know you robbed that truck.

169
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:02,571
You're pretty smart.

170
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:16,212
But you see, I'm smart too.

171
00:14:19,123 --> 00:14:21,819
I finally found a way
to have everything I wanted...

172
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:24,054
...and nobody is gonna mess that up.

173
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:30,797
You don't know what you're doing.

174
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:32,959
Looks like you know about the meteor rock.

175
00:14:33,137 --> 00:14:36,106
It's dangerous. I've seen
what it can do to people.

176
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:39,368
Like get me a multimillion-dollar
contract in the majors?

177
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:43,070
He knows too much.

178
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:46,344
All right, get up.

179
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:51,519
If he goes, our problem goes with him.

180
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,464
We don't know who else he told.
Let's pack up and get out of here.

181
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:16,979
Let's go, man. Put this in the back.

182
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:58,220
- Clark. Oh, my God, what happened?
- I saw one of the hijackers.

183
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:02,482
He goes to our school. I followed him
to the old foundry. They jumped me.

184
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,628
Clark, you still couldn't stop them?

185
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:07,593
No, I think it has to do with
refined kryptonite.

186
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:11,030
They had kryptonite bars,
the same ones that were in Lionel's safe.

187
00:16:11,202 --> 00:16:13,329
That's what they stole from the truck.

188
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:16,567
Clark, what would they be doing
with kryptonite?

189
00:16:16,741 --> 00:16:20,871
Melting it down and inhaling it. That's
what's giving them incredible strength.

190
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:23,570
- Jonathan, we have to bring in the police.
- Yeah.

191
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:25,773
- The police can't do anything.
- Clark.

192
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,852
Dad, they threw me into a blast furnace.
They overpowered me.

193
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:33,047
If there was kryptonite in there,
I wouldn't be here now.

194
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:37,655
We can't let our concern
about your secret intimidate us into silence.

195
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:42,559
Maybe there is another way.

196
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:46,964
Marsh, drop the bat.

197
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:50,972
- What is this?
- I don't wanna tell you again. Drop the bat.

198
00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:53,736
You're under arrest
for assault and armed robbery.

199
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:57,278
- What are you talking about?
- We got a tip, looked through your locker.

200
00:16:57,448 --> 00:16:58,972
You can't without a warrant.

201
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,916
Guess again. We don't need a warrant
to look through a student's locker.

202
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:08,616
The driver, he came to long enough to tell
us about the aliens that trashed his truck.

203
00:17:08,793 --> 00:17:12,388
Don't worry, now.
You can use your one call to phone home.

204
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:23,470
Okay, the only time you're ever this quiet
is when you're sleeping. What's up?

205
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:29,041
Clark and I decided to put our friendship
on an indefinite hiatus.

206
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:33,816
Over one newspaper story?

207
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,053
Let's just say that
certain insurmountable forces...

208
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:41,783
...finally made us raise the white flag.

209
00:17:41,992 --> 00:17:45,223
I'm sorry. If there's anything
I can do to help...

210
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:57,197
Who is that?

211
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,338
Jennifer Small.

212
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:18,786
Thanks.

213
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:23,365
- Mrs. Small.
- It's not what you think, Lana.

214
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:26,101
I don't know what you mean.

215
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,130
I am not cheating on my husband.

216
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:32,465
I know that's what you thought.

217
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:35,043
But the man you saw me with was just...

218
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:37,510
...an old friend of mine from college.

219
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:39,478
Why are you telling me this?

220
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,746
- I wasn't gonna say anything to Henry.
- He also happens to be my divorce attorney.

221
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:46,013
Divorce?

222
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:48,688
Henry never mentioned anything.

223
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:53,195
That's because he doesn't know.
At least, not yet.

224
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:57,029
Why are you divorcing him?

225
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:03,440
Lana, I've learned to handle
a lot in this marriage...

226
00:19:03,607 --> 00:19:07,270
...but that's because through it all,
I knew I was Henry's priority.

227
00:19:07,444 --> 00:19:09,503
Since he met you...

228
00:19:10,114 --> 00:19:12,275
...I am not sure that's true anymore.

229
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:18,685
- I never meant to come between you.
- But you did.

230
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:22,217
Lana, you are all he talks about.

231
00:19:22,626 --> 00:19:26,289
You're a window to a happier time.

232
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:31,792
I guess I am telling you this
because I'm admitting defeat.

233
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:33,630
You win.

234
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:38,808
Mrs. Small, I don't want to win.

235
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:42,642
Goodbye, Lana.

236
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:21,142
- So much for an interview.
- I admire your dedication.

237
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:27,982
Though I suspect the hospital
might not be quite so understanding.

238
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:30,786
Mr. Luthor.

239
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:32,257
What are you doing here?

240
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:36,032
Paying a bedside visit to a loyal employee.

241
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,791
It's Miss Sullivan, isn't it?

242
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,037
You know who I am?

243
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:44,140
I've followed your work
at the Torch for some time.

244
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:48,369
Given today's front-page scoop,
I assume you came...

245
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:51,805
...hoping Mr. O'Connor would confirm...

246
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,346
...his connection with LuthorCorp.

247
00:20:56,787 --> 00:20:58,618
I think you just did that for him.

248
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:07,520
It was never a secret.

249
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:17,765
Unlike the now-missing
contents of your truck.

250
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:22,476
On or off the record?

251
00:21:24,214 --> 00:21:27,980
The police report says robbery,
but no one's been able to find anything.

252
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:31,485
We were moving some industrial material.
It's nothing important.

253
00:21:31,655 --> 00:21:34,123
Somebody sure went to
a lot of trouble to get to it.

254
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,623
Oh, it's a competitive world, you know that.

255
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:41,390
Corporate sabotage is just
one of the costs of doing business.

256
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:45,467
- Mr. Luthor...
- Miss Sullivan, I admire your zeal...

257
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:48,070
...and your work at the Torch
is exemplary...

258
00:21:48,238 --> 00:21:50,229
...but trust me.

259
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:53,535
You're looking for a mystery
where there's none to be found.

260
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:05,619
Clark.

261
00:22:07,157 --> 00:22:09,125
Are you okay?

262
00:22:09,293 --> 00:22:13,662
I got blind-sided yesterday by a couple
of guys. Guess I'm still a little shaken up.

263
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:15,560
What happened, did you get hurt?

264
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:20,227
I'll survive. It was more of a wrong place,
wrong time kind of thing.

265
00:22:20,971 --> 00:22:25,305
I know the feeling,
at least metaphorically speaking.

266
00:22:26,076 --> 00:22:29,102
I ran into Jennifer Small today.

267
00:22:29,813 --> 00:22:32,976
Found out that she's filing
for divorce from Henry...

268
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,549
...and I'm the reason.

269
00:22:36,553 --> 00:22:38,111
That's intense.

270
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:42,425
- Have you talked to Henry about it?
- What can I do without making it worse?

271
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,620
He should know what's going on, there
might be a chance to salvage his marriage.

272
00:22:47,998 --> 00:22:50,466
Sounds like you should be
taking your own advice.

273
00:22:52,102 --> 00:22:54,263
I hear you and Chloe are calling it quits.

274
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,105
That's different.

275
00:22:58,275 --> 00:22:59,640
- Why?
- I can't just sit here...

276
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:03,507
...and watch Chloe get hurt over and over
when I can't do anything about it.

277
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:06,942
What's so bad that's come
between you two like this?

278
00:23:11,021 --> 00:23:12,613
Well...

279
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,751
I wish I could make it go away.

280
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:21,057
- You can't.
- You and Chloe have been friends forever.

281
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:23,961
You can't just let that go without a fight.

282
00:23:26,503 --> 00:23:28,937
At least the Clark Kent I know wouldn't.

283
00:23:49,093 --> 00:23:52,062
If your father sent you,
I had nothing to do with the robbery.

284
00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:54,561
No, no, my father doesn't know I'm here.

285
00:23:54,731 --> 00:23:57,222
I'm sure his representatives
will be around, though.

286
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:59,460
No, I came to talk about your future.

287
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,906
- What do you care?
- I checked into your baseball career.

288
00:24:04,074 --> 00:24:06,736
I understand there's interest
from some big league scouts.

289
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,673
Yeah, there's more than just interest.

290
00:24:08,846 --> 00:24:11,713
All right?
There's college reps, there's agents.

291
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,340
This is just a bump in the road.

292
00:24:14,518 --> 00:24:19,012
Two felony charges with bail set
at a quarter of a million dollars.

293
00:24:19,556 --> 00:24:21,683
I'd say more like a brick wall,
wouldn't you?

294
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:24,327
- Why, do I look scared?
- You look guilty.

295
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:28,595
And if a jury agrees, you can kiss
all that talent and promise goodbye.

296
00:24:31,201 --> 00:24:33,897
Like I told the cops, I didn't do it.

297
00:24:38,475 --> 00:24:41,342
Well, I guess you have
nothing to worry about.

298
00:24:41,512 --> 00:24:43,412
But if the charges stick...

299
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:46,839
...you might need a friend.

300
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,688
All right, what is it that you want?

301
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,157
I want to know what you stole
out of my father's truck.

302
00:25:02,332 --> 00:25:06,530
Well, assuming that I even have a clue
what you're talking about...

303
00:25:08,872 --> 00:25:11,067
...what's in it for me?

304
00:25:29,593 --> 00:25:31,288
Chloe, what happened?

305
00:25:31,562 --> 00:25:32,790
Go away, Clark.

306
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:35,062
Are you okay?

307
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:37,023
Physically, yeah, I'm fine.

308
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:39,135
Emotionally...

309
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,767
...what do you care?

310
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:43,167
I want to help.

311
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:46,904
We'll get the Torch back on its feet.

312
00:25:47,077 --> 00:25:49,841
There is no "we" anymore, Clark.
There's only me.

313
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,610
And this paper was my whole life.

314
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:56,984
It was the one place I could come to when
everyone and everything let me down...

315
00:25:57,154 --> 00:25:59,122
...and now I don't even have that anymore.

316
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:02,053
- Where are you going?
- To find a friend.

317
00:26:07,097 --> 00:26:08,325
Chloe.

318
00:26:08,498 --> 00:26:11,661
Hey, Kent, I heard the paper's
not gonna press.

319
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:13,902
Did you do this?

320
00:26:15,005 --> 00:26:19,499
I don't know how the hell you got out
of that fire, but you'd better back off.

321
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,943
What are you doing out of jail?

322
00:26:22,112 --> 00:26:25,604
Seems I've got friends in higher places
that I didn't even know about...

323
00:26:25,782 --> 00:26:27,682
...and suddenly you're not so anonymous.

324
00:26:27,851 --> 00:26:29,876
I'll testify to put you away.

325
00:26:30,053 --> 00:26:31,884
Oh, no, I'd think about that, Kent.

326
00:26:32,055 --> 00:26:34,888
I know you're unbreakable,
but people that you care about...

327
00:26:35,058 --> 00:26:37,219
...aren't. I'd sure hate to think...

328
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:40,158
...something happened
to those wholesome parents of yours.

329
00:26:48,572 --> 00:26:50,005
Clark.

330
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:52,907
Clark.

331
00:26:54,111 --> 00:26:55,840
Your mother.

332
00:27:06,123 --> 00:27:07,613
How's Mom doing?

333
00:27:08,692 --> 00:27:10,182
She's got some...

334
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:13,956
...minor cuts and bruises.
I still want to get her checked out.

335
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:17,464
This pregnancy doesn't need
any more complications.

336
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:20,566
I should've been there, Dad.

337
00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:22,763
- You couldn't have done anything.
- Still.

338
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,238
I'm not gonna let you
beat yourself up about this.

339
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:27,707
What happens if they come back?

340
00:27:27,878 --> 00:27:30,472
You and Mom should go away,
until this settles down.

341
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:34,846
I have never run away from a single thing
in my life and I'm not about to start now.

342
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:37,146
Look around,
look what they did to this place.

343
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:38,754
You said I can't protect you.

344
00:27:38,922 --> 00:27:41,117
You have to think about Mom,
about the baby.

345
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:44,260
I am thinking about Mom,
I am thinking about the baby.

346
00:27:44,428 --> 00:27:46,191
I'm also thinking about you.

347
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,393
Dad, please.

348
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:50,962
Please.

349
00:27:58,976 --> 00:28:01,342
I'll take your mother to a doctor
in Metropolis...

350
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:04,174
...and maybe stay with your grandfather
for a couple days.

351
00:28:06,717 --> 00:28:10,380
Son, I'd feel a whole hell of a lot better
if you'd agree to come with us.

352
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,657
I can't.

353
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:20,496
I'm not gonna stand here
and ask you to do nothing...

354
00:28:20,664 --> 00:28:23,531
...because you and I both know
that I would not do nothing.

355
00:28:24,968 --> 00:28:27,334
But I want you to
remember something, son.

356
00:28:27,971 --> 00:28:29,495
They have your strength...

357
00:28:29,673 --> 00:28:32,608
...but they don't have
any of your other abilities.

358
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:36,202
You make sure you give yourself
a fighting chance.

359
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:53,026
- Lex.
- I gotta let you go.

360
00:28:53,197 --> 00:28:55,597
I just found out that you visited
Eric Marsh in jail.

361
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:57,700
Were you the one to bail him out?

362
00:28:57,868 --> 00:28:59,961
I wasn't aware my visit
was public knowledge.

363
00:29:00,137 --> 00:29:01,798
What's Marsh have to do with you?

364
00:29:01,972 --> 00:29:04,998
I was the one who phoned
in the anonymous tip.

365
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:08,334
Him and his buddies nearly
killed my parents yesterday.

366
00:29:08,512 --> 00:29:12,744
- Are they all right?
- They're in Metropolis, it's not safe at home.

367
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,478
I heard your father's back.

368
00:29:14,651 --> 00:29:17,643
- Lf this is some sick game between you...
- It's no game.

369
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:22,287
Clark, that truck was carrying a load
of highly refined meteor rocks.

370
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:26,919
If I'm not mistaken, I think my father's
resumed his Level 3 experiments.

371
00:29:28,098 --> 00:29:29,827
What does that have to do with Marsh?

372
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,468
Look, I bailed him out,
hoping he'd provide answers.

373
00:29:32,636 --> 00:29:34,763
Maybe he'd lead me to the meteor rock.

374
00:29:34,938 --> 00:29:36,462
Where is he?

375
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:38,207
I don't know.

376
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:41,572
He beat up a security guard I had on him.

377
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:44,611
There's gotta be a way to draw him out.

378
00:29:45,182 --> 00:29:47,878
Clark, I don't have anything Marsh wants.

379
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:51,948
Except for the meteor rocks.

380
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:57,292
Marsh has a connection inside LuthorCorp
that tells him when the shipments go out.

381
00:29:57,461 --> 00:30:00,259
If he thinks your father's bringing
another load out...

382
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,797
I still have contacts at my father's firm.
They could let the word out.

383
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:07,664
The truck will be empty when Marsh hits.
My security team will be all over them.

384
00:30:07,838 --> 00:30:10,807
I've seen what Eric can do.
You have to get the police on this.

385
00:30:10,974 --> 00:30:12,566
Just go home, Clark.

386
00:30:12,743 --> 00:30:16,201
I don't want you or your parents involved
any more than they already are.

387
00:30:24,788 --> 00:30:27,882
Once Marsh and his friends have the truck,
give them a lot of room.

388
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:30,754
Nobody does anything
until they lead us to the meteor rock.

389
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:33,191
We're set, Mr. Luthor.

390
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:36,327
The truck's getting ready to move.

391
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,627
Wait for my signal
before you start following.

392
00:30:38,802 --> 00:30:40,702
Nobody moves without my direct order...

393
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,811
Change of plans.

394
00:30:58,522 --> 00:31:01,889
Okay, I've got the van.
Get ready to make the switch.

395
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,611
Anybody follow you?

396
00:31:25,315 --> 00:31:29,251
I didn't see anyone, but we'd better hurry.
Luthor's bound to have it bugged.

397
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:19,127
How's it feel, Clark?

398
00:32:47,597 --> 00:32:49,758
Eric, don't do this.

399
00:32:52,035 --> 00:32:54,265
You don't understand, Kent.

400
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:56,466
It's done.

401
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:33,039
That's all of it.

402
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,541
At least for now.

403
00:33:45,956 --> 00:33:47,389
Hey, Lex.

404
00:33:47,824 --> 00:33:50,122
Clark, how are your parents doing?

405
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:53,262
Just fine. They got home
from Metropolis last night.

406
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,421
- That must be a relief.
- Yeah.

407
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,625
Eric's arrested, so it looks like
your plan came off without a hitch.

408
00:33:58,802 --> 00:34:00,360
So it seems.

409
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:03,768
The intriguing thing is,
my people had nothing to do with it.

410
00:34:04,408 --> 00:34:07,172
- Then who did?
- No one knows.

411
00:34:07,344 --> 00:34:09,608
Marsh and his friends aren't talking...

412
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,274
...but they were found unconscious and
the meteor rocks are still unaccounted for.

413
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:16,442
Who do you think has them?

414
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:20,585
I have my suspicions.

415
00:34:27,397 --> 00:34:28,796
Lana.

416
00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:31,763
- Hey.
- Hey, Henry. Thanks for coming.

417
00:34:31,935 --> 00:34:34,529
Your message said something
regarding the horse show.

418
00:34:34,704 --> 00:34:36,569
I hope you're still planning to ride.

419
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,038
To be honest, I'm not sure.

420
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:42,804
I don't understand, I thought you were
really looking forward to this weekend.

421
00:34:42,979 --> 00:34:45,948
I was. Believe me.

422
00:34:48,285 --> 00:34:52,244
But I think it's more important
that you spend this time with Jennifer.

423
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:59,228
Lana, she told me you two talked.
If this is because of something she said...

424
00:34:59,396 --> 00:35:05,062
No, I came into your life out of nowhere
and dropped a bomb on your family.

425
00:35:05,802 --> 00:35:10,535
I didn't know how our relationship was
going to work out, but after a rocky start...

426
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:14,473
...I finally know that you love me.

427
00:35:17,013 --> 00:35:19,413
I don't want to lose that.

428
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:26,180
I don't know what Jennifer told you,
but things between us aren't that bad.

429
00:35:29,259 --> 00:35:31,193
Henry, she's hiring an attorney.

430
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:35,926
What?

431
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:41,500
You need to talk to her,
tell her how you feel.

432
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:46,206
Whatever happens after that is up to you.

433
00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:55,617
You're my daughter,
I just can't walk away from that.

434
00:35:56,086 --> 00:35:59,419
You're not.
I'll always be here.

435
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:07,060
But right now,
I think Jennifer needs you more.

436
00:36:34,157 --> 00:36:36,250
Hey, Dad, how's Mom?

437
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:40,863
You'll be happy to know that both
mother and child got a clean bill of health.

438
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:44,467
- Good.
- Look, son, I wanted to tell you...

439
00:36:46,269 --> 00:36:47,896
Hi, Lana.

440
00:36:49,706 --> 00:36:52,004
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

441
00:36:52,175 --> 00:36:53,767
- Miss Lang.
- Mr. Kent.

442
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,669
You must be here for Donatello.
I'll saddle him up.

443
00:36:56,846 --> 00:36:59,440
No, I'm not practicing, Clark.

444
00:36:59,616 --> 00:37:02,016
In fact, I think I might
drop out of the show.

445
00:37:02,752 --> 00:37:05,084
I take it things with Henry didn't go so well.

446
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:07,786
I told him I'd always be his daughter...

447
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:12,986
...but we should put our relationship on
hold until his marriage gets back on track.

448
00:37:13,797 --> 00:37:16,163
- Wow.
- Yeah.

449
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:19,701
How are things with Chloe?

450
00:37:21,137 --> 00:37:24,766
I went to go talk to her but this whole
Torch thing put her over the edge.

451
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:27,307
She told me to go away.

452
00:37:28,211 --> 00:37:30,475
You two will work through this, Clark.

453
00:37:32,182 --> 00:37:33,740
I hope so.

454
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:37,414
- I miss her already.
- I know what you mean.

455
00:37:37,587 --> 00:37:39,851
I think we should remain
cautiously optimistic...

456
00:37:40,023 --> 00:37:42,457
...that each of us will get a second chance.

457
00:37:44,661 --> 00:37:47,323
You know who's really the loser in all this?

458
00:37:47,497 --> 00:37:48,964
Donatello.

459
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:52,326
Poor horse worked so hard
and now he can't even strut his stuff.

460
00:37:55,405 --> 00:37:57,396
I guess I can't disappoint him.

461
00:37:58,074 --> 00:38:02,238
Besides, I wanted to share this
with someone special and I still am.

462
00:38:05,482 --> 00:38:07,780
You're still going, aren't you, Clark?

463
00:38:11,955 --> 00:38:14,014
You can count on me.

464
00:38:24,267 --> 00:38:25,996
Miss Sullivan.

465
00:38:27,103 --> 00:38:30,595
- Mr. Luthor.
- Your principal told me you might be here.

466
00:38:30,774 --> 00:38:33,038
I hope I'm not interrupting you.

467
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:36,201
No. No, I mean...

468
00:38:37,013 --> 00:38:40,449
...I've never entertained a billionaire before.

469
00:38:41,451 --> 00:38:43,385
You'll have to excuse the destruction.

470
00:38:43,553 --> 00:38:47,011
- I was recently vandalized.
- So I heard.

471
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:50,489
By the same men
who hijacked my truck, I think.

472
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,321
Actually there's still a question.

473
00:38:52,495 --> 00:38:56,625
Eric Marsh owned up to the robbery
of the truck and the assault...

474
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,963
...but he said he didn't have
anything to do with the Torch.

475
00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:03,469
I mean, why confess
to the heavy crimes and deny that?

476
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,134
Well, it's not easy
to understand the criminal mind.

477
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:11,010
What's this?

478
00:39:18,388 --> 00:39:21,255
This is an interesting display.

479
00:39:21,424 --> 00:39:23,085
I call it the Wall of Weird.

480
00:39:25,228 --> 00:39:28,629
I'll come to the point, Miss Sullivan.
I'd like to help you rebuild.

481
00:39:28,998 --> 00:39:33,094
I've instructed the LuthorCorp foundation
to make a donation to your school...

482
00:39:33,269 --> 00:39:35,999
...the fund specifically
earmarked toward rebuilding...

483
00:39:36,172 --> 00:39:39,835
...and updating the journalism department.

484
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:44,436
Mr. Luthor, I'm confused.

485
00:39:46,182 --> 00:39:50,380
I mean, the struggling editor in me
wants to just leave it at "thank you"...

486
00:39:50,553 --> 00:39:52,919
...but the journalist in me has to ask, why?

487
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,854
I'm impressed with your...

488
00:39:56,326 --> 00:40:01,263
...willingness to explore
alternative ideas, options.

489
00:40:02,198 --> 00:40:05,292
You interned at the Daily Planet
this summer, didn't you?

490
00:40:05,468 --> 00:40:06,765
Yeah.

491
00:40:06,936 --> 00:40:08,733
I have a little influence there.

492
00:40:08,905 --> 00:40:11,931
They certainly could use some new blood.

493
00:40:12,876 --> 00:40:14,673
Maybe...

494
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:17,641
...a column...

495
00:40:19,649 --> 00:40:22,516
...to introduce your unique point of view.

496
00:40:27,657 --> 00:40:31,024
I don't want to look a gift horse
in the mouth...

497
00:40:31,394 --> 00:40:35,524
...but I don't understand why the most
powerful man in this city is helping me.

498
00:40:35,698 --> 00:40:39,190
We're after the same thing, Miss Sullivan.
The truth.

499
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:45,339
You know, journalists are
the midwives of history.

500
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:49,075
Perhaps with my help, we could...

501
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:53,945
...make history together.
