1
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,746
Let's do this

2
00:00:19,124 --> 00:00:20,517
uh-huh

3
00:00:30,426 --> 00:00:32,100
Be right with you

4
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:44,296
Hello...?

5
00:00:55,113 --> 00:00:56,574
Hey, fellas.

6
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:24,668
Hercules.

7
00:02:29,869 --> 00:02:31,358
What happened in there?

8
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:33,951
I don’t know. Get him inside.

9
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:39,034
Load up!

10
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,408
Where the hell’s Einstein?

11
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:50,887
Call him back.

12
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,320
Hey, this is Chloe. I’m not in right now, so leave
a message and I’ll get right back to you.

13
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:05,634
Hey, Chloe, it’s Lo.

14
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:08,434
I’m officially out of the dorm and on
my way back to the Kents’.

15
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:11,288
But I realized I’m still getting my mail at your place.

16
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,956
Can you bring it by in the morning?

17
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,299
Okay, thanks. Bye.

18
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:29,187
Oh, my God. What have I done?

19
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:39,180
Oh my God

20
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:42,491
Ok... I didn't see you. Ok...

21
00:03:42,538 --> 00:03:44,746
We’re gonna get you out of here.

22
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:49,997
Ok

23
00:03:51,723 --> 00:03:54,515
You’re gonna be fine.
I know you’re gonna be fine.

24
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,910
Everyone I’ve ever hit was all right.

25
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:05,221
Smallville - Season 4 Episode 14
"Krypto"

26
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:24,664
Hey.

27
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:27,259
I was just getting in. What are you guys doing?

28
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:29,596
We seem to have a visitor.

29
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:31,381
A hungry visitor.

30
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:34,161
Hey, he’s supposed to be tied up in...

31
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,110
the barn

32
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:41,121
I chained him to a post for a second so that I could get my stuff
out of the car and well...

33
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:44,408
Yeah.

34
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:54,258
I had him chained right there.

35
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:57,942
Okay, that’s just bad wood.

36
00:05:57,989 --> 00:05:59,433
That’s not my fault.

37
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,768
How’d that post break?

38
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:10,725
Oh, my allergies...

39
00:06:10,778 --> 00:06:12,909
Where did you say you found him?

40
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,439
Actually, I kind of...

41
00:06:16,813 --> 00:06:17,916
hit him.

42
00:06:18,186 --> 00:06:20,546
You hit him? With your car?

43
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:22,956
No, with my fist.

44
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:26,625
I was gonna call the vet, but when I got in just now

45
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:27,638
he seemed fine.

46
00:06:27,697 --> 00:06:29,896
I think you need to make some fliers in the morning.

47
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,074
That way, maybe we can figure out who he belongs to.
He’s got a collar. I’m sure somebody’s missing him.

48
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,926
Fine with me.

49
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:44,058
Actually, it might be fun to have a dog around.

50
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:51,455
Maybe if we can’t find out who owns him, we can keep him.

51
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:53,847
Why don’t we just see what happens tomorrow, Clark?

52
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:56,899
Yeah, don’t get too attached.

53
00:06:57,545 --> 00:06:59,292
I’m going to bed.

54
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:03,266
We should all get some sleep.

55
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,407
You know, I’m gonna do my chores.

56
00:07:06,612 --> 00:07:08,491
It’s three o’clock in the morning.

57
00:07:08,755 --> 00:07:14,063
Dad, since Lois is staying here, if I’m gonna do my work at
super speed, I have to do it when she’s not looking.

58
00:07:14,697 --> 00:07:16,884
All right, then why don’t you start with that?

59
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:18,528
Come on.

60
00:07:45,143 --> 00:07:48,211
Well, at least I don’t have to hide anything from you.

61
00:08:07,474 --> 00:08:09,008
- Hey, Chloe.
- Hey.

62
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:12,398
Lois, uh, had her mail forwarded to my apartment.
Is she around?

63
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:15,290
Yeah, she’s probably still in the, uh...shower.

64
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:16,464
Who’s the puppy?

65
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:18,486
We don’t know his name. Lois found him.

66
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,319
She’s bringing home strays now, huh?

67
00:08:22,332 --> 00:08:24,064
How is the new tenant?

68
00:08:24,114 --> 00:08:25,135
Lois?

69
00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:27,942
Well, she, uh, re-recorded our answering machine...

70
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:30,932
...uses all the hot water, oh,
and she took over my bedroom.

71
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:32,634
- She’s doing great.
- Ok.

72
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:34,161
How are you?

73
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:38,811
I don’t know. It’s just kind of hard to be
myself with her around.

74
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:42,899
Yeah, but now you got this guy.

75
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:45,447
You can be yourself around him, right?

76
00:08:48,746 --> 00:08:50,571
And I’m always around.

77
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:57,463
Ooh, it’s cold.

78
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,070
I’m gonna go see if I can find her.

79
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:01,661
All right. I’ll be right in.

80
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,547
Ok

81
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:03,880
Come on.

82
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,927
We’ll see if this’ll hold you.

83
00:09:18,895 --> 00:09:19,987
Good boy.

84
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,609
Stay.

85
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:54,425
Holy...

86
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:57,645
Hey

87
00:09:58,174 --> 00:10:00,745
Looks like you got a secret too.

88
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:02,741
Where are you from?

89
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:05,559
Good boy.

90
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:21,253
- What did you do?
- What?

91
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,165
Oh, I, um... it must have rolled.

92
00:10:24,377 --> 00:10:25,643
Through a fence?

93
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:28,626
Yeah, weird, huh?

94
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:30,457
Yeah.

95
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:31,747
Yeah, weird.

96
00:10:33,543 --> 00:10:35,492
But, I mean, it happens, you know?

97
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:38,625
The emergency brake must’ve slipped or something.

98
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,515
It’s old, you know? It’s an old tractor.

99
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,818
It is old.

100
00:10:42,957 --> 00:10:44,883
Anyway, I’m gonna get going.

101
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:46,994
- I’ll see you guys around.
- Bye.

102
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:52,829
Just playing with Skippy here.

103
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,116
We’re not gonna call him Skippy.

104
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:58,252
Okay, Lois, what would you like to call him?

105
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:03,960
Let’s see. He’s annoying, and I can’t seem to get within
ten feet of him without getting sick...

106
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:06,227
I think we should call him Clarkie.

107
00:11:06,943 --> 00:11:09,221
Come here, Clarkie! Come here, boy!

108
00:11:09,338 --> 00:11:12,379
I made him some fliers.
He can be somebody else’s allergy now.

109
00:11:12,426 --> 00:11:16,066
You know what? I don’t think we’re gonna have to use those.
I found one of those microchip ID tags under his skin.

110
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:18,318
I think they can scan it at the animal shelter.

111
00:11:18,354 --> 00:11:20,256
I spent all morning on these

112
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:27,116
I’ll be right back. I have to tell my parents something.

113
00:11:30,885 --> 00:11:32,529
Don’t give me that look.

114
00:11:34,748 --> 00:11:35,655
Clarkie.

115
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:46,626
We should probably get your mom a new pot
roast while we’re out.

116
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:48,639
Sit, Clarkie.

117
00:11:49,461 --> 00:11:50,682
Good dog.

118
00:12:04,115 --> 00:12:05,383
Hey, Shhh

119
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:10,526
Hi

120
00:12:11,008 --> 00:12:12,370
How can I help you guys?

121
00:12:12,405 --> 00:12:14,105
- We found this dog.
- Actually,

122
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:15,796
I found him.

123
00:12:15,831 --> 00:12:17,992
Well, hit him actually.

124
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:19,835
Not hard.

125
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:21,256
We call him Clarkie.

126
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:22,592
We don’t call him Clarkie.

127
00:12:22,627 --> 00:12:24,858
Is it the “ie” part you don’t like?
Because...

128
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:29,541
we could always just make it Clark.
But then that would get really confusing, and hey...

129
00:12:29,576 --> 00:12:32,182
maybe you should consider changing your name.

130
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,367
You could be Skipper.

131
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:39,434
Anyway, uh, we think he might have an ID chip.
We were wondering if you could scan it for us.

132
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,993
If it’s not too much trouble.

133
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:47,721
Um, well, sure, I guess.

134
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:52,427
Whoa! Easy, boy.

135
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,527
Yeah. He doesn’t seem to have a lot of love for you.

136
00:12:55,562 --> 00:12:57,112
Maybe I should do that.

137
00:13:01,952 --> 00:13:03,243
Bless you.

138
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:05,392
Thanks

139
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:12,358
Luthorcorp?

140
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:13,685
You’re kidding.

141
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:14,825
Huh.

142
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,858
It must be one of those lab dogs or something.

143
00:13:17,907 --> 00:13:19,222
Lab dogs?

144
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:23,334
I’d be happy to take him off your hands
and return him for you.

145
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,448
Actually, you know what?

146
00:13:26,587 --> 00:13:29,276
Um, that’s okay. We’ll take care of it.

147
00:13:29,323 --> 00:13:30,554
Thanks.

148
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,160
Come on, boy. Come on.

149
00:13:33,336 --> 00:13:35,614
I should probably get your name and address, though...

150
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:38,007
in case someone from LuthorCorp calls.

151
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,815
It’s policy.

152
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,453
Would you mind taking him back to the farm?
I’m gonna go talk to Lex.

153
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:46,461
Terrific.

154
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:49,291
Come on. Let’s go sneeze a while.

155
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:51,158
Heel, Clarkie.

156
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,326
Thanks

157
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:07,785
Hey, Josh

158
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:10,556
Guess who just showed up?

159
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:13,938
Einstein

160
00:14:14,924 --> 00:14:15,805
Yeah,

161
00:14:15,852 --> 00:14:18,778
Some guy named Clark Kent’s keeping him out on his farm.

162
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,134
That’s good news little brother.

163
00:14:26,152 --> 00:14:30,467
‘Cause I was thinking that we were gonna have to rob
that truck tomorrow with just this dummy.

164
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,549
Why do you have to do that?

165
00:14:39,498 --> 00:14:40,907
What do you care?

166
00:14:44,406 --> 00:14:46,038
It’s just a dog.

167
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,122
How’s he doing, anyway?

168
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:55,363
It can still hold a few hours,
He’s got a couple hours left in him

169
00:14:55,398 --> 00:15:00,058
long enough to help us get Einstein back.
And then we can shoot them both up and...

170
00:15:01,022 --> 00:15:03,053
get their strength back for tomorrow.

171
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,732
So how come you guys couldn’t get the effect
to last longer anyway?

172
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,237
I don’t know, Zack. I was just a trainer.

173
00:15:22,325 --> 00:15:24,462
The plan’s back on, little brother.

174
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,655
Let’s close up shop, huh?

175
00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:29,086
Yeah sure.

176
00:15:39,643 --> 00:15:40,911
Genevieve...

177
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:43,694
What a surprise.

178
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:47,721
If you’re looking for Jason, I sent him
to Metropolis on a business errand.

179
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:50,236
Actually, I came here to see you, Lex.

180
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,489
Oh, I didn’t realize we had any more business to discuss.

181
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:55,966
Drink?

182
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:03,040
I take it my son has proven to be a good hire.

183
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:04,390
Excellent.

184
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:07,734
He’s taken a real passion for the project I’ve given him.

185
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:13,886
I gather this project does not require him
to relocate out of Smallville.

186
00:16:13,945 --> 00:16:15,692
Highly doubtful.

187
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:20,271
I underestimated you, Lex.

188
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:22,596
Well, that’s a common mistake.

189
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,045
But not one I usually make.

190
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,200
Seems that headstrong young men have...

191
00:16:31,728 --> 00:16:33,783
become my blind spot.

192
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:36,553
Ask Jason.

193
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,301
And now you.

194
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:44,596
You asked me to give Jason a position at LuthorCorp.

195
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,239
I’m not sure I understand your problem.

196
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:52,394
You know exactly why I wanted you to hire Jason.

197
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:55,421
Get him away from Lana Lang.

198
00:16:56,219 --> 00:17:00,752
But instead, you decided to co-opt him for
your own purposes.

199
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:03,685
Genevieve...

200
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,250
paranoia is not a very attractive quality in a woman.

201
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:13,947
I’m just trying to protect my son.

202
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:19,301
Well, maybe you should get together with my father and
write a parenting book.

203
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:21,685
I bet it’d be a bestseller.

204
00:17:25,676 --> 00:17:30,667
Then you’re no longer interested in how your
father was released from prison?

205
00:17:31,712 --> 00:17:35,346
I’ve chosen to believe my father truly is reformed.

206
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:39,397
Therefore, the question of his guilt or innocence
no longer bothers me.

207
00:17:40,136 --> 00:17:42,860
But it’s great seeing you again, Genevieve.

208
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:48,037
And you too, Lex.

209
00:17:50,843 --> 00:17:53,203
Give my best to Jason.

210
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:59,189
It’s a shame he won’t be able to help you...

211
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:01,761
find what you’re looking for.

212
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,751
It’s hard to believe he’s as strong as Clark says he is.

213
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:41,009
He certainly is a beautiful dog.

214
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,309
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I know what you’re thinking.

215
00:18:44,344 --> 00:18:48,471
Well, it might be nice for Clark to have a dog.
It’s been kind of a lonely year for him.

216
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:52,628
Well, wait a minute. What happens when Clark
goes off to college next year, huh?

217
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:55,783
Who winds up having to take care of that dog? Me.

218
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:59,071
Lois, it’s time for dinner!

219
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:08,279
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

220
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:10,533
You see?

221
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:11,543
Well,

222
00:19:11,578 --> 00:19:14,831
remember when Clark did that? He was only three.

223
00:19:14,864 --> 00:19:16,707
It’s not funny. Hey!

224
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:24,549
What happened?

225
00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:27,648
That’s my T-bone!

226
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:31,582
Oh, bad dog.

227
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,668
Clark

228
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:40,087
Grab a stick. I was just about to break.

229
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:43,243
Lex, is LuthorCorp doing experiments on dogs?

230
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,308
I’m not really sure that’s any of your business.

231
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:49,900
Lois found a stray dog. It has a LuthorCorp ID tag.

232
00:19:51,782 --> 00:19:52,909
Are you?

233
00:19:53,978 --> 00:20:00,307
Clark, when I took over the company, I found quite a few
irregular experiments being conducted at my father’s request.

234
00:20:00,342 --> 00:20:02,802
One of them involved animal testing.

235
00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:09,295
What were they doing?

236
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:14,717
If I remember correctly, they were...

237
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:19,366
mixing meteor rock with a steroid to
enhance canine strength.

238
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:23,427
Why would your dad be interested in making
super-powered dogs?

239
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:30,563
If I understood my father’s insanity, Clark,

240
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:32,876
I’d be a much happier man.

241
00:20:33,768 --> 00:20:37,549
But I suppose in this case, there were
military applications.

242
00:20:38,383 --> 00:20:42,170
I guess I’ll never really know for sure.
The results were inconclusive.

243
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:46,620
I had animal rights activists picketing the site
so I closed it down.

244
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,286
I was told the dogs were destroyed.

245
00:20:49,603 --> 00:20:51,227
Evidently not all of them.

246
00:20:53,646 --> 00:20:56,288
Is it exhibiting any problems?

247
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,031
Is that your way of asking me if it has super strength?

248
00:21:01,068 --> 00:21:02,378
No

249
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,838
No, I assume you’d tell me that because...

250
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:09,348
I’d have quite a liability on my hands if he did.

251
00:21:13,478 --> 00:21:15,638
The dog’s perfectly healthy.

252
00:21:16,998 --> 00:21:19,668
Well, then I’m sure the Kent farm will be...

253
00:21:19,698 --> 00:21:21,778
a perfect home for him.

254
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,538
Sorry about dinner.

255
00:21:36,638 --> 00:21:39,338
I guess it’s just sandwiches tonight.

256
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,308
Jonathan?

257
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:16,758
Jonathan!

258
00:22:16,828 --> 00:22:18,228
Stay back

259
00:22:20,968 --> 00:22:22,388
Jonathan!

260
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,568
- Oh my god, Jonathan!
- Stay back

261
00:22:26,118 --> 00:22:27,188
Martha...

262
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:29,468
- Get away!
- No!

263
00:22:29,508 --> 00:22:31,818
Get away!
Get away from him.

264
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:54,968
Sweetheart.

265
00:22:55,258 --> 00:22:56,578
Are you ok?

266
00:22:58,708 --> 00:22:59,898
Are you all right?

267
00:23:00,108 --> 00:23:01,468
That's ok.

268
00:23:05,508 --> 00:23:09,268
Lois, get the car keys. We have to take
him to the hospital.

269
00:23:24,516 --> 00:23:26,606
Dad, what’d they say?

270
00:23:26,846 --> 00:23:30,736
Well, the doctor said he’d never seen a dog that
could bite clean through bone before.

271
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:32,496
Look at this.

272
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,306
The store owner’s in a coma.

273
00:23:35,356 --> 00:23:37,946
He was attacked by something that could pulverize
a steel door.

274
00:23:37,986 --> 00:23:39,856
Now the police think it’s a bear, but...

275
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:41,106
You think it was the dogs.

276
00:23:41,126 --> 00:23:44,016
Someone’s obviously controlling these dogs and using them.

277
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:47,966
Look, the only people that knew we had the dog were
Lex and that guy at the animal shelter,

278
00:23:47,996 --> 00:23:51,696
and since the boy billionaire probably doesn’t go
around robbing convenience stores...

279
00:23:51,716 --> 00:23:52,636
We should check it out.

280
00:23:52,676 --> 00:23:54,666
Well, let’s do that first thing in the morning, all right?

281
00:23:54,706 --> 00:23:59,176
Um, Clark, would you give me a hand signing out, would you?

282
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,776
Look, son, I know that you’re...

283
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:05,936
really attached to this dog, but I’m worried he
could be dangerous, even to you.

284
00:24:05,976 --> 00:24:08,136
I know, that’s why I have to find out
who’s doing this and stop them.

285
00:24:08,176 --> 00:24:09,476
No, Clark...

286
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,856
son, it won’t make any difference.

287
00:24:11,906 --> 00:24:14,626
If they had anything to do with putting that man in a coma...

288
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,246
then they’re gonna have to be put down.

289
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:21,696
Dad, when you and mom found a super-powered
boy in a cornfield,

290
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:24,646
you didn’t give up on me just because I might be dangerous.

291
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:27,126
You raised me. You gave me a chance.

292
00:24:28,236 --> 00:24:30,136
He’s a good dog, Dad.

293
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:33,226
Someone’s just using him to do bad things.

294
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:35,306
We should give him a chance.

295
00:24:39,726 --> 00:24:42,616
I want you to leave here with me tonight.

296
00:24:43,196 --> 00:24:44,266
Why?

297
00:24:45,556 --> 00:24:48,886
Because of Countess Marguerite Isobel Theroux?

298
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:53,136
You know that name, don’t you?

299
00:24:53,436 --> 00:24:55,726
Is this what Lex has you doing?

300
00:24:56,306 --> 00:24:59,296
Researching 17th century witches?

301
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:02,936
You’re incapable of giving a straight answer, you know that?

302
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:08,376
So apparently when Isobel was condemned to die,

303
00:25:08,766 --> 00:25:11,376
she vowed to rise again through one of her descendents.

304
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:14,226
You knew that that was Lana, didn’t you?

305
00:25:14,266 --> 00:25:17,856
That’s why you had me bring her to Isobel’s tomb in Paris

306
00:25:18,176 --> 00:25:22,146
because you knew that if she received the mark
then she was the one.

307
00:25:23,476 --> 00:25:25,736
Which means it’s-- it’s my fault...

308
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:27,206
that everything’s happening to her.

309
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,000
You can’t blame yourself.

310
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,766
How could you use me like that?

311
00:25:36,306 --> 00:25:38,776
Look, it’s not safe for you to stay here.

312
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,716
Well, I’m not leaving Lana.

313
00:25:42,326 --> 00:25:45,776
Well, perhaps you’ll change your mind when
you hear the rest of the story.

314
00:25:47,276 --> 00:25:50,586
Isobel was condemned by a woman named Gertrude.

315
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:52,486
Isobel vowed...

316
00:25:52,526 --> 00:25:56,996
that when she rose from the dead, that she would
wipe out all of Gertrude’s heirs.

317
00:25:57,716 --> 00:26:00,186
We’re Gertrude’s ancestors, Jason.

318
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,726
So you think that Lana is going to kill you?

319
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:04,006
No

320
00:26:04,686 --> 00:26:07,586
But Isobel will, and who knows when she’ll return?

321
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:10,406
Mother, I walked out on Lana once before.

322
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:13,456
I’m not gonna do it again.

323
00:26:13,536 --> 00:26:15,906
Then you’re in love with a girl...

324
00:26:17,426 --> 00:26:19,846
that may kill our entire family.

325
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:37,326
What is it, an obstacle corse?

326
00:26:48,276 --> 00:26:50,406
Oh, crap!

327
00:26:57,976 --> 00:27:00,346
You see him anywhere? Come here, Clarkie!

328
00:27:00,466 --> 00:27:01,736
Come here, boy!

329
00:27:04,716 --> 00:27:08,016
Wow. Could the dander get any thicker in here?

330
00:27:08,286 --> 00:27:09,706
You know, I’ve been thinking.

331
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:13,066
Clarkie might’ve had something to do with what
happened at that convenience store,

332
00:27:13,106 --> 00:27:16,366
but I don’t think he hurt that guy.
There wasn’t any blood on him when I found him.

333
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:19,756
We’re not gonna call him Clarkie, okay?
We’re gonna call him Bear

334
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,096
or Bandit or something.

335
00:27:21,146 --> 00:27:22,906
Uh, no and no.

336
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:49,226
What is all this?

337
00:27:49,306 --> 00:27:52,836
It’s LuthorCorp payroll.
They’re gonna hit an armored truck.

338
00:27:52,866 --> 00:27:56,416
And it’s happening right now. Lois, call the police.
I’m gonna see if I can catch up with these guys.

339
00:27:56,456 --> 00:27:59,086
Hold on there, Forrest Gump.
What are you gonna do, run?

340
00:27:59,116 --> 00:28:00,356
We brought my car, remember?

341
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:01,656
Lois, look--

342
00:28:01,696 --> 00:28:03,436
Unh-unh. We can call the cops on the way.

343
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,466
You are so weird sometimes.

344
00:28:18,256 --> 00:28:20,176
You know, can you go a little bit faster?

345
00:28:20,216 --> 00:28:23,446
Hey, you were gonna be hoofing it about ten minutes ago.
Besides...

346
00:28:23,476 --> 00:28:25,236
I don’t want to hit anything.

347
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:33,726
It should be right here.

348
00:28:34,076 --> 00:28:35,646
Well, it’s not.

349
00:28:41,976 --> 00:28:44,126
Let’s go, let’s go, come on!

350
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:46,046
Get the money. Grab the money, come on!

351
00:28:46,106 --> 00:28:48,416
Stop yelling at me. I dropped the bag, okay?

352
00:28:50,836 --> 00:28:52,166
Wait, turn left, turn left.

353
00:28:52,226 --> 00:28:52,846
Why?

354
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:54,366
Just do it!

355
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,726
What is this, another one of your famous hunches,
or are we just on a little scenic route here?

356
00:29:05,756 --> 00:29:07,516
- Okay, stop here.
- Wha-- where?

357
00:29:07,556 --> 00:29:09,936
- Here ! Stop here!
- Okay!

358
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:20,476
Go, go

359
00:29:27,276 --> 00:29:28,946
Grab the bags, let's go!

360
00:29:28,986 --> 00:29:29,816
I am.

361
00:29:29,846 --> 00:29:31,376
Come on, faster!

362
00:29:32,316 --> 00:29:34,286
Those guys back there don’t look so good.

363
00:29:34,546 --> 00:29:36,206
Forget these screwed-up guards.

364
00:29:36,996 --> 00:29:39,076
Get the money. Let’s go!

365
00:29:44,426 --> 00:29:45,816
All right. Come on.

366
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,086
Buckle up, little brother.

367
00:29:53,316 --> 00:29:54,526
Come on.

368
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,076
Can you go see if you can help those guys?

369
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:12,366
It’s all right, buddy. We’ll get you out of here.

370
00:30:30,376 --> 00:30:31,326
Clark?

371
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:06,855
What’s he barking about?

372
00:31:07,585 --> 00:31:10,085
I don’t know, but in five minutes it won’t matter.

373
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:12,615
We burn the truck, the dogs, everything.
All the evidence.

374
00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:13,615
What--

375
00:31:14,545 --> 00:31:17,545
We’re gonna be in the Keys before anyone knows we’re gone.

376
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,785
Where’s Einstein?
- What the hell?

377
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:33,635
It’s that guy from the animal shelter.

378
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:35,115
Well, well, well.

379
00:31:35,155 --> 00:31:38,175
Looks like someone has some explaining to do.

380
00:32:16,815 --> 00:32:17,875
Oh Well

381
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:20,195
you just had to be a hero, didn’t you?

382
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:23,665
Sometimes heroes get burned.

383
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:42,165
Are you sure about this?

384
00:32:42,195 --> 00:32:44,045
He saw our faces. We can’t let him walk.

385
00:32:44,085 --> 00:32:45,555
This wasn’t part of the plan.

386
00:32:45,595 --> 00:32:47,515
The plan is working, okay?

387
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,325
We got the money and we’re almost out of here.

388
00:32:50,855 --> 00:32:53,195
You’re not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? Huh?

389
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:00,505
No

390
00:33:01,785 --> 00:33:03,185
I didn’t think so.

391
00:33:03,225 --> 00:33:04,275
Come on.

392
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:17,805
Make a wish, little brother.

393
00:34:42,995 --> 00:34:44,445
Going somewhere?

394
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:53,551
This guy’s quite a hero from what I understand.

395
00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:56,571
Yeah, I hope my dad lets me keep him.

396
00:35:57,821 --> 00:36:02,201
Doctor, you didn’t notice anything unusual about any tests you ran on him, did you?

397
00:36:02,241 --> 00:36:03,491
Like what?

398
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:07,701
Well, he just seems really strong sometimes and
he likes to get into things.

399
00:36:07,731 --> 00:36:11,181
Well, if anything, I’d say his strength is a little below average.

400
00:36:11,231 --> 00:36:14,051
You’ve got a perfectly normal, healthy dog here.

401
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:15,631
You thought of a name yet?

402
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:17,961
I was thinking of calling him Krypto.

403
00:36:18,321 --> 00:36:19,781
Interesting name.

404
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:24,071
Well,

405
00:36:24,131 --> 00:36:25,211
I better be going.

406
00:36:25,241 --> 00:36:26,601
Thanks, Dr. Klein.

407
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:27,681
You’re welcome.

408
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:32,381
Krypto

409
00:36:34,731 --> 00:36:36,261
What does it mean?

410
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:39,771
Friendly.

411
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:43,821
It’s because his background is so... cryptic.

412
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:47,731
Speaking of his background,

413
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:51,441
I went out to the scene of the robbery and
saw my armored truck.

414
00:36:51,771 --> 00:36:57,251
From the look of the back doors, I can only
assume it was the handiwork of some very strong dogs.

415
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:00,741
Lex, you told me I could keep him back
when you thought he was a failed experiment.

416
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:04,031
But Clark, if the experiment didn’t fail,
this dog could be dangerous.

417
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:05,741
But he’s not dangerous now.

418
00:37:06,511 --> 00:37:07,941
He saved my life.

419
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:10,961
I’ll take my chances on his loyalty.

420
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:26,841
So do you mind telling my why I was up until
two in the morning researching Jason’s family tree?

421
00:37:27,131 --> 00:37:31,311
I mean, not that it wasn’t, you know,
halfway interesting, it’s just...

422
00:37:31,371 --> 00:37:36,171
you definitely got your place in the Guinness Book of Strangest Last-Minute Requests.

423
00:37:36,201 --> 00:37:37,201
I, uh,

424
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:40,511
saw him downstairs talking to his mom.

425
00:37:40,701 --> 00:37:43,041
It was obviously a heated discussion, but uh...

426
00:37:43,071 --> 00:37:45,901
when he came up to the apartment, he didn’t
even mention it to me.

427
00:37:45,941 --> 00:37:47,571
Well, did you hear what they were talking about?

428
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:48,381
No

429
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:51,631
But it clearly rattled him.

430
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:55,071
Chloe, he’s keeping something from me.

431
00:37:56,111 --> 00:38:00,021
You know, I don’t even know who I can trust anymore.

432
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:03,351
Did you find anything?

433
00:38:04,421 --> 00:38:06,161
Not much.

434
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:09,931
I mean, I can only go back as far as his mom’s grandmother.

435
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:14,771
After that, it’s like someone just chopped off a
part of his family tree. There’s nothing there.

436
00:38:14,831 --> 00:38:20,381
I can tell you that she comes from a town called
Castelnois de Montmiral.

437
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,011
That’s all I know. Well, except that...

438
00:38:24,341 --> 00:38:25,951
Lana, are you okay?

439
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:27,711
Chloe...

440
00:38:28,581 --> 00:38:31,581
this is the town that my ancestors come from.

441
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:33,971
And Isobel Theroux.

442
00:38:36,151 --> 00:38:39,361
Well, on a scale of weird to ten...

443
00:38:39,721 --> 00:38:45,081
Genevieve’s grandmother is the one who moved Isobel’s
tomb into that church in Paris.

444
00:38:45,111 --> 00:38:48,821
Why would anyone move a witch’s tomb into a church?

445
00:38:49,141 --> 00:38:51,531
I think that’s something you need to ask Jason.

446
00:39:03,151 --> 00:39:06,411
If you’re looking for my son, he’s not here.

447
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:08,911
I’m just returning something.

448
00:39:08,961 --> 00:39:11,941
Yes, yes. How’s the research coming?

449
00:39:13,511 --> 00:39:15,121
I’m not sure I know what you mean.

450
00:39:15,161 --> 00:39:17,331
Yes, you do. I mean Isobel.

451
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:25,171
I understand your hesitation.
When I found out that you’d been...

452
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:30,361
hired by my son, I put a few of the pieces
together and saw a connection.

453
00:39:31,761 --> 00:39:33,121
You, hmm..

454
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:36,761
you’re Genevieve Teague’s boy.

455
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:42,081
Yes

456
00:39:42,741 --> 00:39:44,301
Of course

457
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:51,821
You can’t trust her, Jason.

458
00:39:53,451 --> 00:39:57,061
Of course, you can’t trust my son either, but I
think you know that.

459
00:39:57,631 --> 00:40:00,341
And I suppose you’re gonna tell me I can trust you, though.

460
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:06,551
What’s this?

461
00:40:06,591 --> 00:40:07,781
Open it.

462
00:40:34,261 --> 00:40:36,061
I think it might help you.

463
00:40:43,631 --> 00:40:44,651
Done.

464
00:40:45,961 --> 00:40:48,161
Well, took you long enough.

465
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:52,711
Now you just have to fix the dining room table,
the window, the fence, and...

466
00:40:59,481 --> 00:41:02,841
I thought bathing him was supposed to help
with my allergies.

467
00:41:02,871 --> 00:41:05,091
Well, maybe you’re allergic to the soap too.

468
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:07,181
Maybe I’m allergic to you.

469
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,271
Can you grab me a towel please?

470
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:16,101
Thanks.

471
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:21,251
So, what are we gonna call him?
And don’t give me any of this Skipper crap.

472
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:23,521
I was thinking we could call him Krypto.

473
00:41:23,561 --> 00:41:26,151
Why, because he’s so cryptic like you?

474
00:41:26,191 --> 00:41:27,501
I don’t think so.

475
00:41:27,841 --> 00:41:28,991
Why not?

476
00:41:29,471 --> 00:41:31,331
Because I think it’s dumb.

477
00:41:31,381 --> 00:41:33,941
You can call your next dog Krypto.

478
00:41:34,121 --> 00:41:38,211
Look, it’s not that hard. Max, Lucky, Rocky, Bailey,

479
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:40,211
Scamp, Monty, Bud?

480
00:41:40,241 --> 00:41:41,361
Hey,

481
00:41:41,411 --> 00:41:43,861
you’re gonna have to pick one of those if
you want to keep him.

482
00:41:47,861 --> 00:41:48,711
Really?

483
00:41:56,191 --> 00:41:59,851
You know, when I was a little girl, we had a dog
that looked just like this one.

484
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:02,091
Maybe that’s why I liked him so much right away.

485
00:42:02,131 --> 00:42:03,791
His name was Shelby.

486
00:42:06,761 --> 00:42:08,271
I can live with that.

487
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:09,971
Well, it beats Clarkie.

488
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:12,971
yeah...

489
00:42:14,251 --> 00:42:16,851
Come on, Shelby! Let’s go outside.

490
00:42:30,491 --> 00:42:32,921
Nice catch!

491
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:34,301
Come on, boy!

492
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
