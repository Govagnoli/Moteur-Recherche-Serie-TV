1
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:05,474
France, 1604

2
00:00:05,474 --> 00:00:08,301
It won't open!

3
00:00:08,606 --> 00:00:12,414
We must escape before we reach the fields.
Isabelle?

4
00:00:12,476 --> 00:00:16,133
They've taken the book, and with it our
powers. What would you have me do?

5
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:20,473
- Anything, we're running out of time!
- Time is the one thing we do have.

6
00:00:20,677 --> 00:00:23,144
If we fall this night, I promise you...

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,974
We will rise again to finish our quest.

8
00:01:23,524 --> 00:01:25,775
Magistrate Wilkins...

9
00:01:25,893 --> 00:01:28,267
Come to enjoy your handywork?

10
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:33,350
Give me the 3 stones of power, countess.

11
00:01:33,572 --> 00:01:36,538
You may yet escape the pyre's flames.

12
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:41,341
My book.
There's a page marked.

13
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:49,275
What means this?

14
00:01:51,627 --> 00:01:54,992
It means that the stones of power
shall be mine.

15
00:01:55,096 --> 00:01:58,647
And once I possess them, you shall
tremble at my feet.

16
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:01,622
And never again persecute my kind.

17
00:02:03,963 --> 00:02:06,396
[Latin]

18
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:17,880
Demon.
Join your confederates.

19
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:23,137
Please. Have mercy.

20
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:27,747
No, please... Have Mercy!

21
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:31,192
Madeline Evans.
Brianna Withridge.

22
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:34,263
Countess Marguerite Isabelle Thoreaux.

23
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:40,353
You have been found guilty of committing
the darkest art... Witchcraft.

24
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:45,416
For this affront against God, I hereby
condemn you to burn in the fires of hell.

25
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:49,164
Of which you so eagerly
seek communion.

26
00:03:01,044 --> 00:03:04,339
You think this ends with a lick of flame?

27
00:03:05,257 --> 00:03:07,158
I sleep but a while...

28
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,756
And when the time is appointed,
my heir will awaken me...

29
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:14,759
And I will have vengeance!

30
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:39,234
So, you found it on 'E-bay'?

31
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,438
Yeah, this old guy in Nice was
auctioning it off.

32
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:46,433
I had to max-out my entire credit card
to get it...

33
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:49,908
But I couldn't resist, it was like
it was calling to me.

34
00:03:56,394 --> 00:04:00,789
The spell-book of Countess Isabelle
Marguerite Thoreaux.

35
00:04:00,937 --> 00:04:03,756
Those look like the same symbols
in the cave.

36
00:04:03,947 --> 00:04:05,246
Yeah.

37
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:09,062
Maybe it will help explain what happened
in Paris when I touched Isabelle's tomb.

38
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:12,508
And the tattoo,
and the missing 12 hours...

39
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:16,611
So, how's your Latin?

40
00:04:16,753 --> 00:04:20,668
About as good as my Italian, which...
I don't speak.

41
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:31,097
Oh, I'll get it.

42
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:34,768
- Oh my God...
- What?

43
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:38,226
This is the symbol from Isabelle's tomb.

44
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:40,230
That's kind of spooky.

45
00:05:03,623 --> 00:05:05,297
You O.K.?

46
00:05:17,953 --> 00:05:20,414
Never been better.

47
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,421
Hey Lois, what are you doing here,
why aren't you in school?

48
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,400
We're having a surprise party for Chloe's
18th birthday in your barn, remember?

49
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:38,561
No, I remember telling you you couldn't
have it here.

50
00:06:38,575 --> 00:06:41,316
Too late now! Everyone's already been
invited, and you

51
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:44,258
really don't want it getting back to Chloe
that you rained on her shindig,

52
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:45,731
That would hurt her feelings.

53
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,931
- What?
- Then I'd have to hurt you.

54
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,339
- Listen, Lois, I don't wanna.
- Would you give me a hand with these,

55
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:54,627
I have to get the wheels back to my dad
before he realizes they're missing.

56
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,371
Lois, we can't do this tonight, the guy
from Princeton's coming to meet me.

57
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:02,358
- Besides, my parents are out of town.
- Relax, 'Smallville. ' It's just going

58
00:07:02,364 --> 00:07:05,203
to be a couple of people, standing around
singing 'Happy Birthday. '

59
00:07:05,263 --> 00:07:08,590
It's not going to be Sodom and Gomorrah.
Mr. Ivy League won't even know we're here.

60
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:09,899
Trust me.

61
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:34,220
Hair of 2 virgins.

62
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,158
Ha, we've been a good little
girl, haven't we?

63
00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:48,896
Hello? Oh, you are home. I've been
calling, but no one answered.

64
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:56,047
Well, I've been kind of preoccupied.
Science project.

65
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,533
From what century?

66
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:04,207
It's a whole retro thing. Trying to
recreate some stuff they did in the 1600s.

67
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,262
Oh.

68
00:08:08,393 --> 00:08:12,066
I really think you two are going
to like it.

69
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:15,248
Damn. I left my phone in your
car. Do you mind?

70
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,695
Oh no, no worries. This smell of science
is making me crave

71
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,626
and aromatic latte anyway, so I'll just
meet you downstairs with your cell phone.

72
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,108
- Bye.
- Bye. Thanks!

73
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:31,400
What's the matter with you? You were
supposed to take Chloe shopping,

74
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:33,588
so that I could finish everything
with the party?

75
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:35,942
Right. Must have slipped my mind.

76
00:08:35,977 --> 00:08:40,247
Wow. Get some traction. 'Little Miss
Reporter' there? She can smell a ruse

77
00:08:40,335 --> 00:08:44,235
a mile away. I'm going to need some
serious help to keep her from ferretting

78
00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:46,741
out whatever it is we're planning tonight.
Ow!

79
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:55,300
- Oh no, no, that's no good.
- Well yeah, not since you pulled it out!

80
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,926
- It was grey.
- I don't have grey hair.

81
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:07,703
I'm just going to use your
bathroom for a second.

82
00:09:19,027 --> 00:09:22,872
7. Hair of 2 virgins
8. Oil of Mushroom

83
00:09:37,906 --> 00:09:40,682
Maybe you need a woman's touch.

84
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:44,766
Hey. Lana.

85
00:09:45,102 --> 00:09:46,796
Hello Clark.

86
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:51,030
It's a big box.

87
00:09:53,738 --> 00:09:57,136
It's a gift for Chloe. Lois and I
got it for her.

88
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,500
I'm sure that she'll love it.
Especially if it's from you.

89
00:10:03,013 --> 00:10:07,478
Look, I'm glad you're here. I wanted to
talk to you about what happened with Jason.

90
00:10:07,497 --> 00:10:10,122
Oh don't worry about it.

91
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:16,507
It's water...
under a very tall bridge.

92
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:23,515
Are you feeling O.K.?

93
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,008
You seem a little...
different.

94
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:30,881
Maybe it's the company.

95
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:39,679
Jason's my friend.

96
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:44,932
Well, he doesn't think so...

97
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,032
- Hey! What you doing?

98
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:55,700
I wanted a lock of your hair for a
scrapbook I'm making for Chloe's birthday.

99
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:58,800
Well all you had to do was ask!

100
00:10:58,835 --> 00:11:01,132
Well where's the fun in that?

101
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:06,150
What happened to these?

102
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:08,956
They were broken already.

103
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:12,589
Here, is that enough?

104
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,908
It's perfect.

105
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,311
Thanks, handsome.

106
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:56,955
You play beautifully.

107
00:11:57,646 --> 00:12:00,793
Thanks, but I'm afraid
I'm a little rusty.

108
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:03,627
Well I hate to interrupt, but...

109
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:06,123
I wanted to ask you for a favor.

110
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,200
Have I ever been able to refuse
Lana Lang?

111
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,249
What do you need?

112
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,514
Oh, a good bottle of wine for
Chloe's birthday.

113
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:20,040
The last time I checked, she wasn't
turning 21 yet.

114
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:24,963
I know, but I thought it'd be nice to raise
a glass with her and Lois to celebrate.

115
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:29,951
I promise I won't tell anyone
where I got it from.

116
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,700
It'll be our little secret.

117
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:41,779
Well, I think I might have a light Riesling
that won't do too much damage.

118
00:12:45,451 --> 00:12:50,229
Actually I was looking for more a vintage
Merlot from the South of France.

119
00:12:50,258 --> 00:12:54,162
Something from the vineyard in the Londoc
or possibly the Doldogne,

120
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,070
that should do in a pinch.

121
00:12:56,357 --> 00:13:00,368
Well, your tastes have certainly matured
from a summer in Paris.

122
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,821
Just give me a second.

123
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:13,689
1902, from the Salgier vineyards
in Londoc.

124
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:16,647
It should make quite
the birthday present.

125
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,257
What is this?

126
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:22,746
Just a little something I picked up in
St. Petersburg.

127
00:13:22,763 --> 00:13:25,167
It's an illuminated manuscript, depicting
the ancient...

128
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:26,060
You're lying...

129
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,661
What?

130
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:33,796
You know its true nature, but the map
was not meant for you.

131
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,621
Lana, how did you know there's a
map hidden under the page?

132
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:39,382
Because...

133
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,159
- [Latin]
- Lana, what did you do?

134
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:54,873
You seek the stones, don't you?

135
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:02,256
Well, we can't have that.

136
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:07,911
I think that you're right, Alexander,
you do need more practice.

137
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:12,761
Keep playing... 'Infinitas'.

138
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,519
[Latin]

139
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:08,963
O.K. What are we doing in the woods?
Chloe's right behind me, and the moonlight

140
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,890
nature hike, it's making her
a little suspicious.

141
00:15:11,938 --> 00:15:14,951
I thought it'd be nice to get together
with my girls before the party.

142
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:16,720
What party?

143
00:15:17,102 --> 00:15:19,331
Way to ruin the surprise.

144
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:23,239
Oh you mean the party that you've been
planning for the last month?

145
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,790
You knew about that?

146
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,219
'Hello!' Investigative Reporter, nothing
gets past me! Except...

147
00:15:29,282 --> 00:15:34,286
why we're playing 'Wood Nymph' when there's
a party waiting for me with my name on it.

148
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:37,331
Then we'd better hurry.

149
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:47,478
A toast. In honor of this special night.

150
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,478
Alright. This is getting better.

151
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:56,862
No matter how much time passes...
old friends are never forgotten.

152
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,239
I'll drink to that.

153
00:16:01,506 --> 00:16:03,157
Cheers.

154
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:29,463
Madeline?

155
00:16:31,806 --> 00:16:33,629
Brianna?

156
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:38,443
Welcome to the 21st century.

157
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,187
How did we come to be here?

158
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:44,383
The last spell I cast before Wilkins
condemned me to the Pyre.

159
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:48,372
My blood entwined with a symbol in the
book which called to my heir.

160
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:53,374
And when she touched it, I gained
possession of her body.

161
00:16:54,356 --> 00:16:56,282
And brought you back.

162
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:59,525
I'm gorgeous! Look at these!

163
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:03,001
Yes, they're very nice.

164
00:17:03,015 --> 00:17:07,937
Ah, the woods of France.
I'd know them anywhere.

165
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:10,798
We're in Kansas, Madeline.

166
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,384
- Where?
- The Americas.

167
00:17:13,402 --> 00:17:18,551
I am unsure as to why I was resurrected
here, it was not my intention, but...

168
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:21,552
The book! Do you have it?

169
00:17:28,718 --> 00:17:32,976
It is ours once again.
And with it our magics...

170
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,999
Now we may continue our quest
for the stones...

171
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:40,219
Is that the same quest that got us
burned at the stake?

172
00:17:40,254 --> 00:17:42,150
That was not pleasant.

173
00:17:42,155 --> 00:17:45,460
A small toll to travel the road of
ultimate power.

174
00:17:47,427 --> 00:17:51,533
You have your hosts' memories, use
them to navigate this world...

175
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:54,868
And help us to seize the power!

176
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:05,571
HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHLOE

177
00:18:15,614 --> 00:18:18,100
Hey, Jason, do you know where the girls are,
they were supposed to be here 1 hour ago.

178
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:19,526
No I'm sorry.

179
00:18:22,823 --> 00:18:25,902
- Look, Jason.
- Clark, I'm only here because Lana

180
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:27,975
wants me to be here.

181
00:18:28,031 --> 00:18:30,985
Because I'm her boyfriend.
Whether you like it or not.

182
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:55,400
We don't have time for this.

183
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,864
Time is the only thing we do have.

184
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:00,792
Isn't that what you said before the angry
mob set us on fire?

185
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,682
You're really not going to let
that go, are you?

186
00:19:08,295 --> 00:19:10,800
The guy from Princeton's going to be
here any minute,

187
00:19:10,836 --> 00:19:12,511
why are you so late?

188
00:19:12,522 --> 00:19:14,538
I took the scenic route.

189
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,683
Love the view.

190
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,349
Have you been drinking?

191
00:19:26,204 --> 00:19:30,593
So, I don't want to be rude but I think
I'm just going to tell Chloe Happy Birthday

192
00:19:30,654 --> 00:19:33,743
and take off.
- You're a big boy. You can do what you want.

193
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:37,330
- You're the one who wanted me here.
- Well, things change.

194
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:41,524
Why are you acting like this?
And why are you dressed like that?

195
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,505
Because it makes me feel sexy.

196
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,411
Weren't you leaving?

197
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:04,446
- The food is so good in this century!
- And the men actually bathe.

198
00:20:05,753 --> 00:20:09,009
And the bodies are so hard!

199
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:13,128
But we have definitely had better
celebrations. This is appalling.

200
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:14,969
We could change that.

201
00:20:17,364 --> 00:20:22,271
Well it has been 400 years. Perhaps a
little fun before we continue our quest.

202
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:29,574
[Latin]

203
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,273
Clark?

204
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:12,409
Where's Clark Kent?

205
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:17,993
Clark!

206
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,657
Clark!

207
00:21:23,122 --> 00:21:26,221
Mr. Jacobs. Princeton University?

208
00:21:27,256 --> 00:21:30,988
Hey, come on in, join the party!
Woooo!

209
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,175
Hey, mom!
How was Metropolis?

210
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:11,774
Really. I'm glad you're having
a great time.

211
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,294
What?

212
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:18,384
Oh yeah, the guy from Princeton.

213
00:22:18,913 --> 00:22:21,220
I met him last night. I, uh...

214
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:26,362
Don't worry...
I think I made an impression.

215
00:22:30,997 --> 00:22:34,791
Lex. Can I talk to you for a second?
I've got a big problem.

216
00:22:34,815 --> 00:22:38,298
I was supposed to meet this alumni from
Princeton last night, but then...

217
00:22:38,307 --> 00:22:42,629
Lois wanted to throw a party for Chloe in
the barn, the party kind of got out of hand,

218
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,616
then the guy from Princeton showed up, and
I think I blew it. Look, I hate to ask you,

219
00:22:47,652 --> 00:22:50,093
but do you have any connections
at Princeton?

220
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:56,345
Lex?

221
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:05,454
Lex, what are you doing?

222
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:12,983
Stop!

223
00:23:13,368 --> 00:23:15,815
- Stop it!
- I can't!

224
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:22,227
- Lex, what happened?
- Lana...

225
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:38,243
You really shouldn't play with that.

226
00:23:38,341 --> 00:23:40,669
You might hurt yourself.

227
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:43,990
I heard you and the girls were the
life of the party last night.

228
00:23:44,014 --> 00:23:48,716
One last fling before I finish what
I started a long time ago.

229
00:23:50,455 --> 00:23:53,135
You don't want to get in my way.

230
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:54,951
Who are you?

231
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:57,578
[French]

232
00:23:58,852 --> 00:24:02,971
- Isabelle?
- In the new flesh.

233
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:07,386
What did you do with Lana?

234
00:24:07,452 --> 00:24:09,859
She's in here somewhere.

235
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,813
Could you let her out?

236
00:24:14,374 --> 00:24:17,989
Now why on Earth would I
ever do that?

237
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,472
You know all this started when Lana
found this book.

238
00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:29,530
So I'm guessing if anything happens
to this book...

239
00:24:32,445 --> 00:24:36,283
You have no idea what you're dealing
with, Little Man...

240
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:37,722
[Latin]

241
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:45,668
So now you begin to understand...

242
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:48,728
You're not but an insect in my path...

243
00:24:48,793 --> 00:24:52,788
One to be crushed on the journey
toward greater things.

244
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,867
Lana, no!

245
00:25:06,732 --> 00:25:09,244
Jason! Are you O.K.?

246
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:19,829
THE BARN... MIDNIGHT

247
00:25:30,674 --> 00:25:32,731
You're early.

248
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,047
Not planning something devious,
are you Clark?

249
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:38,299
What did you do to Lex and Jason?

250
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:42,296
Nothing, compared to what we're going
to do to you...

251
00:25:42,871 --> 00:25:44,671
[Latin]

252
00:26:01,758 --> 00:26:05,754
I don't know what's going on, but this
needs to stop, before it gets out of hand.

253
00:26:05,812 --> 00:26:08,073
So, you're more than just fast.

254
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,707
That will make this
a whole lot more exciting.

255
00:26:16,046 --> 00:26:17,805
[Latin]

256
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:33,959
I don't want to hurt anyone.

257
00:26:34,525 --> 00:26:37,148
Your magics are impressive.

258
00:26:37,351 --> 00:26:38,812
Magic?

259
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:41,668
But so are mine.

260
00:26:41,824 --> 00:26:43,927
[Latin]

261
00:26:50,106 --> 00:26:54,497
We have travelled through the ages to
complete our quest.

262
00:26:54,502 --> 00:26:59,853
I wouldn't doubt this now - We will not
be undone my a farm boy with a few tricks.

263
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:07,911
He's not what he seems, Isabelle.

264
00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:12,226
- I can feel his power.
- Then perhaps we should rid him of it.

265
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:16,820
Chloe, you've got to help.

266
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:21,412
- I know you're in there.
- Clark?

267
00:27:21,484 --> 00:27:23,988
Listen to me, you've got
to help me.

268
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:41,781
[Latin]

269
00:28:02,341 --> 00:28:04,314
It is done.

270
00:28:04,411 --> 00:28:07,266
His powers are gone.

271
00:28:29,898 --> 00:28:32,082
He awakens.

272
00:28:34,444 --> 00:28:35,964
What have you done to me?

273
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:39,075
We made sure you're no longer a
threat... Sorcerer.

274
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:41,518
I'm not a sorcerer.

275
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,234
You're not?

276
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:45,258
Are you sure?

277
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:48,716
No. He's something else.

278
00:28:49,218 --> 00:28:51,619
Something special.

279
00:28:52,525 --> 00:28:56,871
I could sense it when your magics
were ripped from your body.

280
00:28:58,814 --> 00:29:01,795
I can taste it on you.

281
00:29:03,142 --> 00:29:05,736
The 3 stones of power...

282
00:29:06,816 --> 00:29:09,682
You know of them, don't you?

283
00:29:09,752 --> 00:29:11,881
I've never heard of them.

284
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:18,459
You've done more than hear them...

285
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:20,423
You've touched them.

286
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,667
We can feel it.

287
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:24,803
There's more.

288
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:28,618
You know where one of them is hidden.

289
00:29:29,592 --> 00:29:31,990
Tell us where it is, Clark.

290
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:35,229
Please tell us.

291
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:37,814
I don't know what you're talking about.

292
00:29:38,497 --> 00:29:41,066
Let me cut it out of him...

293
00:29:41,135 --> 00:29:42,836
No!

294
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:50,008
There are easier ways
to get what we want.

295
00:29:54,324 --> 00:29:57,472
This body I inhabit...

296
00:29:58,228 --> 00:30:01,957
You have desires for it, don't you?

297
00:30:06,031 --> 00:30:09,526
Well it desires you too, Clark.

298
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:13,437
Very...
very much.

299
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:23,833
[Latin]

300
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:43,325
THE... CAVE...

301
00:30:47,503 --> 00:30:51,949
Thank you, Clark.
You've been very helpful.

302
00:30:54,046 --> 00:30:55,366
[Latin]

303
00:30:58,804 --> 00:31:00,185
Clark?

304
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:13,566
You alright? What happened?

305
00:31:16,247 --> 00:31:17,800
Did Lana do this to you?

306
00:31:17,864 --> 00:31:20,406
Take it easy... Where is she,
I need to find her.

307
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:23,510
She's with Lois. And Chloe, but they're
different they're not themselves

308
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:25,044
it's like their bodies have
been taken over.

309
00:31:25,122 --> 00:31:27,587
They have. In fact this is going to sound
kind of 'out there'...

310
00:31:27,644 --> 00:31:29,583
let's get you up...

311
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:33,544
Lana has been researching a 17th century
witch. She tracked down her spell-book,

312
00:31:33,624 --> 00:31:35,296
and when she touched her hand to the page...

313
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:38,338
Wait a second, Lana's been possessed
by the spirit of an evil witch?

314
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:41,581
Yes. Isabelle got into Lana by using the
book. So we've got to find her and

315
00:31:41,586 --> 00:31:44,592
destroy the book. Any idea where
they went?

316
00:31:45,393 --> 00:31:47,408
I'm not sure.

317
00:31:47,468 --> 00:31:50,301
Why don't you check the school?
I'll go to the Talon.

318
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,977
Alright.

319
00:31:52,855 --> 00:31:56,107
Clark. Call my Cell if you find them,
don't...

320
00:31:56,153 --> 00:31:58,506
Don't try anything alone.

321
00:31:58,524 --> 00:32:01,273
Just be careful, O.K.?

322
00:32:07,597 --> 00:32:09,914
Begins to make sense...

323
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:14,940
Why I was ressurrected here, in this
time, 1000 leagues from my home.

324
00:32:15,373 --> 00:32:17,639
It was destiny.

325
00:32:21,528 --> 00:32:23,786
Can you feel it?

326
00:32:23,903 --> 00:32:25,859
Calling to us.

327
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:30,299
The 1st stone of power lies behind
this wall.

328
00:32:31,332 --> 00:32:36,059
And with it, our magic shall
increase ten-fold.

329
00:32:36,293 --> 00:32:39,644
And when we possess all the stones,

330
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:45,464
we shall walk on Earth as Gods among men.
Reach out, and seize what was meant to be!

331
00:32:55,522 --> 00:32:57,871
[Latin]

332
00:33:03,243 --> 00:33:06,447
[Latin]

333
00:33:19,235 --> 00:33:23,868
All of our suffering, all of our pain and
persecution...

334
00:33:23,925 --> 00:33:25,943
It ends tonight.

335
00:33:26,132 --> 00:33:30,807
- And our future begins.
- Take it Isabelle, lead us to glory!

336
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,929
The 1st stone.

337
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:38,189
How I've dreamed of this moment.

338
00:33:38,471 --> 00:33:43,416
And at last, it has arrived...

339
00:33:47,436 --> 00:33:49,319
Not quite.

340
00:33:53,436 --> 00:33:56,367
You shouldn't have come, Clark.

341
00:33:57,199 --> 00:33:59,104
Silly boy.

342
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:03,566
We owe you a debt for revealing this
chamber to us.

343
00:34:04,226 --> 00:34:06,244
We were going to let you live.

344
00:34:06,267 --> 00:34:08,772
I'm sorry Lana, but I can't
let you do this.

345
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:17,021
Bear witness, Clark Kent...
to the dawn of a new age!

346
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,310
- His powers are restored.
- How?

347
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:40,789
I'm not from around here.

348
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:44,649
It doesn't matter. We took them from
you once before.

349
00:34:44,712 --> 00:34:48,202
Do you really believe that this time
will be any different?

350
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:51,009
I'm counting on it.

351
00:34:57,801 --> 00:35:00,891
No!

352
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,456
Why are we lying in the dirt?

353
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:30,947
And what the hell are we wearing?

354
00:35:34,855 --> 00:35:36,707
Are you O.K.?

355
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,909
Clark, what happened?

356
00:35:44,265 --> 00:35:48,778
Let's just say that,
you haven't been yourself lately.

357
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,932
- Look who's finally awake.
- Mom!

358
00:36:03,052 --> 00:36:05,660
- When did you guys get home?
- This morning. Your dad is out there

359
00:36:05,758 --> 00:36:08,505
doing your chores.
- Sorry.

360
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,951
I guess I overslept.

361
00:36:12,768 --> 00:36:14,256
Hey dad.

362
00:36:15,213 --> 00:36:16,867
Hey Clark.

363
00:36:17,504 --> 00:36:22,468
Son, is there maybe a little something
you'd like to tell your mother and me?

364
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:26,354
Where did that come from?

365
00:36:26,425 --> 00:36:28,950
From out in the barn.
In the hay.

366
00:36:29,007 --> 00:36:31,545
- Clark!
- It was magic.

367
00:36:31,602 --> 00:36:35,005
- I'm sure it was.
- No, I mean... it really was!

368
00:36:35,094 --> 00:36:38,898
Look I should not have thrown this party
without talking to you guys, I know that.

369
00:36:38,992 --> 00:36:42,054
But, it's the way things spun out of control.

370
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:44,856
It was Lana, well it wasn't Lana
exactly...

371
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:48,833
She was possessed by a witch, who then
cast a spell on us, and...

372
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,870
That's how that happened.

373
00:36:50,956 --> 00:36:55,501
Son, I realize that after all, this is
Smallville, but witches and spells...

374
00:36:55,552 --> 00:36:58,614
and... Magic?

375
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:01,509
Dad, magic exists...
I saw it.

376
00:37:02,496 --> 00:37:05,250
And worse, it can hurt me.

377
00:37:20,565 --> 00:37:23,408
You leave quite a path
of destruction.

378
00:37:23,478 --> 00:37:26,990
Lex! I was going to come see you.

379
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,753
Pre-emptive strike.

380
00:37:28,782 --> 00:37:32,632
Just in case there was any
'Evil Dead' action still brewing.

381
00:37:33,214 --> 00:37:36,571
Apparently, I have been exorcised.

382
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:40,856
I didn't do anything to you, did I?

383
00:37:41,473 --> 00:37:43,484
Nothing permanent, but...

384
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,863
you did display some
intriguing abilities.

385
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,259
I don't remember anything.

386
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:52,959
I don't think I really want to.

387
00:37:53,211 --> 00:37:55,202
I'm just glad you're alright.

388
00:37:55,271 --> 00:37:57,154
Thanks to Clark.

389
00:37:57,535 --> 00:38:00,041
I don't remember what he did, but...

390
00:38:00,094 --> 00:38:02,692
Isabelle's back to being history.

391
00:38:02,768 --> 00:38:05,561
I guess we all owe Clark our gratitude.

392
00:38:05,941 --> 00:38:07,897
Yeah.

393
00:38:08,115 --> 00:38:12,158
You know, I really don't understand him.

394
00:38:12,352 --> 00:38:16,496
He can be so selfless, risking his
life for his friends and...

395
00:38:17,072 --> 00:38:21,325
then he turns around, and gets
Jason fired.

396
00:38:21,513 --> 00:38:24,844
Because what, he jealous?

397
00:38:29,785 --> 00:38:31,359
Lana.

398
00:38:33,867 --> 00:38:36,646
Clark didn't get Jason fired.

399
00:38:38,374 --> 00:38:39,775
I did.

400
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,674
You what?

401
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:48,042
Look, no matter how mature you may
think you are, the fact is you're still

402
00:38:48,068 --> 00:38:50,013
in high school, and...

403
00:38:50,032 --> 00:38:53,448
I wasn't going to sit idle while someone
in a position of authority coerced you

404
00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:55,396
into a relationship.

405
00:38:55,928 --> 00:38:58,689
What are you doing Lex?

406
00:39:00,668 --> 00:39:03,096
I'm trying to protect you.

407
00:39:03,102 --> 00:39:05,996
Do you really think that's what I need?

408
00:39:06,065 --> 00:39:08,383
Lana, I know you're upset.

409
00:39:09,058 --> 00:39:12,303
But I only had your best
interests at heart.

410
00:39:12,591 --> 00:39:16,022
My interests are none of your
concern, Lex.

411
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:20,755
I'm old enough to decide who I want
in my life.

412
00:39:20,763 --> 00:39:23,093
And who I don't.

413
00:39:42,365 --> 00:39:44,626
At least those aren't mine.

414
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:46,993
Hey... Lana.

415
00:39:48,846 --> 00:39:51,140
I wanted to thank you.

416
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,534
Once again, you managed to
come to my rescue.

417
00:39:56,414 --> 00:39:58,368
Well it's good to have the old Lana back.

418
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:00,586
Isabelle was...

419
00:40:01,722 --> 00:40:03,854
Aggressively sexy.

420
00:40:03,892 --> 00:40:07,685
Oh great.
Possessed by an evil slut.

421
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:18,068
Look, I found out the Lex was the one
that got Jason fired.

422
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:22,325
I should have known that you would
never do anything like that.

423
00:40:23,014 --> 00:40:26,850
Look, I wasn't thrilled when I heard
about you and Jason.

424
00:40:27,316 --> 00:40:31,997
But I realize that the way I acted when
we were together didn't make you happy.

425
00:40:32,108 --> 00:40:36,026
I always resented you for keeping secrets
from me.

426
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:40,645
And I don't want to do the same
thing to you.

427
00:40:41,966 --> 00:40:44,840
Clark, there's a reason that I came
back to Smallville.

428
00:40:44,887 --> 00:40:49,505
When I was in Paris, I touched Isabelle's
tomb, and there was this flash of light,

429
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:53,481
and the next thing I remember is
waking up in my apartment.

430
00:40:53,502 --> 00:40:55,607
And I had this.

431
00:41:03,702 --> 00:41:06,446
I've seen this before.

432
00:41:07,428 --> 00:41:09,454
On the cave wall.

433
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:15,202
I should have told you this months
ago, but I was too scared.

434
00:41:15,819 --> 00:41:18,546
Clark, you know those caves better than
anyone else...

435
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:21,382
Do you know what this symbol means?

436
00:41:24,145 --> 00:41:28,416
No. I'm sorry.
