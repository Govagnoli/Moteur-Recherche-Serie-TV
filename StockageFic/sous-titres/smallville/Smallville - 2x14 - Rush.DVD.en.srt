1
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,211
They're inside already.

2
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:32,057
- I don't believe this.
- I know. Isn't it awesome? A rave in a cave.

3
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,029
Why didn't you tell me it was here?

4
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,033
I didn't know.
I just downloaded the directions.

5
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,966
Clark's gonna go crazy.

6
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,300
What is his obsession with these caves?

7
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,874
I don't know.
I think Kyla really got to him.

8
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,879
- I better give him call, give him a heads-up.
- These caves survived hundreds of years.

9
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,212
I don't think a little Moby's gonna
hurt them. Okay?

10
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,478
Let's go.

11
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,219
Come on!

12
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,313
Excuse me.

13
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,710
Hey, excuse me.

14
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:28,686
Can you please step off the walls.
The paintings.

15
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,356
Pete, I really don't think
they care about the cave paintings.

16
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,930
Yeah, but, Chloe, these
pictographs are sacred.

17
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,301
I'm sorry, do you guys know that
the clay doesn't wash out of your clothes?

18
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,711
Just gotta hit them where it hurts.

19
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,659
Travis, what are you doing?

20
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:13,390
Taking my shot.
I always thought you were hot.

21
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,830
I think you're kind of wasted.

22
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,994
No, I'm just high on life.

23
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:30,043
Chloe, did I just see you making out
with your chem-lab partner?

24
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,580
- Travis!
- Hey, get down from there!

25
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,491
Hey, get down from there!

26
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,965
This is hopeless.

27
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:19,429
I'm invincible!

28
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,613
Pete!

29
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,453
What are you doing? You nuts?

30
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,529
- Just out taking a little spin.
- Without your helmet, like a wild man.

31
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,129
You could have hurt someone,
most likely yourself.

32
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,667
Yeah, that's a rush.

33
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,842
Chloe told me what happened.
Sorry I wasn't there to back you up.

34
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:13,342
Hey, you're never more alive
than the moment before you die.

35
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,810
At least Travis had that.

36
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,013
- Hey, you feeling okay?
- I feel great.

37
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,884
If you want to talk about what happened,
I'm here for you.

38
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,089
Clark, all you ever do is talk.

39
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,726
For a guy who can't get hurt,
you never take any risk.

40
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,996
That's not true.

41
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,723
What about with Lana?
Now that Fordman's toast...

42
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,233
...when are you gonna
take your shot with her?

43
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,400
Come on, Pete, Whitney was your friend.

44
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,872
Besides, it's not that easy.

45
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,308
Why? Because you can't share
your secret?

46
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,779
- You shared it with me, and we're still cool.
- That's different.

47
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,215
You're just afraid she'll shut you down.
You only go around once.

48
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,945
Forget about the past.

49
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,118
Focus on the future.

50
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,058
Hey.

51
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,722
Hey.

52
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,889
Did you hear about Travis?

53
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,590
Yeah, pretty sad, huh?

54
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,498
Yeah. The police think he might
have been on something...

55
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,631
...which is the only explanation.

56
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:52,506
I mean, we always assume that we have all
the time in the world, but we never know.

57
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:03,013
The school counselor told me I need to
look forward, embrace living, carpe diem.

58
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:07,216
At first I thought it sounded corny,
but the more I think about it, she's right.

59
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:10,191
You know, I just don't want to be
a spectator in my own life.

60
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,321
Yeah, me neither.

61
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,527
We should go on a date, together.

62
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,172
In the near future.

63
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,341
Are you serious?

64
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,103
I was.

65
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,841
- But if you don't want to go...
- When?

66
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,476
You mean you'll go?

67
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,683
Yeah.

68
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,157
I assume that was the answer
you were looking for.

69
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:47,295
- Yeah. I just didn't think it'd be that easy.
- Well, all you had to do was ask.

70
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:53,130
- Well, how about tomorrow?
- Sounds like fun.

71
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,868
- Right, it's a date.
- Okay.

72
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,868
Don't bother.
I've got a maintenance crew coming.

73
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,568
- Lex, I didn't see you there.
- I was just checking for damage.

74
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,412
Looks like it was quite a bash.

75
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,941
Pete tried to break it up.

76
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,519
Oh, I'm sure it was a noble effort...

77
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:47,625
...but not many teenagers are interested
in 500-year-old cave paintings.

78
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:52,258
- What's your interest, Clark?
- What do you mean?

79
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:57,164
When I fired the security guard, I asked
him who else he let in these caves.

80
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,634
He told me you were down here
almost every day.

81
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,570
Now, you wouldn't be keeping secrets
from me, would you, Clark?

82
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,144
Kyla gave her life for these caves.

83
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,282
I'm doing a term paper on the drawings.

84
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:19,117
"Deciphering the Mysteries
of Hieroglyphics...

85
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,226
...by Dr. Fredrick Walden."

86
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:24,255
Sounds like a real page-turner.

87
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,325
Lex, why'd you start
the preservation project?

88
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,662
It's not like there's big business in caves.

89
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,801
I like a good mystery.

90
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,207
This one promises to be fascinating.

91
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,574
Wouldn't you agree?

92
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,515
I better get going.

93
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,984
I told the new security men nobody comes
down here without my permission.

94
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,955
Nobody except for Clark Kent, of course.

95
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,380
- Hey, I didn't hear you leave this morning.
- Oh, I had to be here first thing.

96
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,019
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were avoiding me.

97
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,781
Don't take it personally.
It's just how I cope.

98
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,718
I don't want to be one of those
annoying people that says:

99
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,224
"I'm here if you need to talk,"
but I am.

100
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,658
I appreciate it.

101
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,831
Listen, if you don't feel like talking...

102
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:37,628
...I thought we could go to Metropolis
tomorrow and do some serious shopping.

103
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,830
My dad said that he would join in on the
conspiracy and get us out of school early.

104
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,143
Thanks, and I'd love to.

105
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,178
But, you know,
I already have plans with Clark.

106
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,413
- What kind of plans?
- Well...

107
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,882
...he asked me out on a date.

108
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,655
I thought you were giving up
on the mating dance.

109
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,385
Yeah, yeah, me too.

110
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,689
But you still said yes.

111
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,495
- Look, if this is gonna be too weird for you...
- No.

112
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,996
My feelings for Clark are so ancient...

113
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,608
...they're... They're fossilized.

114
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,247
Seriously, you should go for it.

115
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,747
Are you sure?

116
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,483
Lana, does it really matter how I feel?

117
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,218
If I was in your position,
I'd do the exact same thing.

118
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,086
Don't let me be your excuse.

119
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,092
Okay.

120
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,964
I'm glad we cleared the air.

121
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,004
Me too.

122
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,972
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

123
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,550
- Loans are expensive.
- He might get a scholarship.

124
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,247
- That would be great, especially with...
- What's all this?

125
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:08,917
We've got our finances under control.
We're trying to get a head start on college.

126
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,461
If you ever graduate from high school.

127
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,892
What do you mean?

128
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:17,297
Principal Reynolds called this morning.
It seems you've been chronically late.

129
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:21,896
He asked me if we had some emergency
here at the farm we needed your help with.

130
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,602
I've just been spending
more time in the caves.

131
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,245
Listen, son, we know how much
they mean to you...

132
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,109
...but until you get on track,
I don't want you down there.

133
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,806
- No, Dad...
- Don't argue with me.

134
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,179
Once things get straightened out,
we can talk...

135
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:38,084
...but until then I want your butt
in this house every day after school.

136
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,588
- Give me until tomorrow.
- No.

137
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,283
It's really important.

138
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,060
What is it?

139
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,225
I've got a date...

140
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,796
...with Lana.

141
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,261
A study date?

142
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,730
An actual date.

143
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,702
Jonathan, you have to let him go.

144
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,503
Please. Come on.

145
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,144
Promise me you'll get your
homework and chores done...

146
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,145
...before you set
one foot outside of that door?

147
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,873
Absolutely.

148
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,420
- Okay.
- Thanks, Mom.

149
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,315
When you see Pete, tell him to stop
cutting doughnuts in the field.

150
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,254
He's scaring the cattle.

151
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,900
I appreciate you coming on short notice,
Professor Walden.

152
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,299
Yeah, normally I wouldn't.

153
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,965
It's not often that I'm offered my
weekly rate for a 10-minute consultation.

154
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:35,239
As I told your associate, I'm not able
to take on any new endeavors at this time.

155
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,879
Then when can you start?

156
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,376
- Next year.
- I was thinking more like tomorrow.

157
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,543
I leave for Chile on Tuesday.

158
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,255
I'm sure you can postpone your trip.

159
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:46,886
It's out of the question.

160
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:53,756
If you want the foremost authority
in a field, Mr. Luthor, you learn...

161
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,299
...to wait.
- In my experience...

162
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,995
...when you want the best,
you simply pay them what they're worth.

163
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,469
Rich men with delusions of grandeur...

164
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,670
...rarely sway me with a checkbook.

165
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,554
Does this sway you?

166
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,932
That is quite unique, I can tell you that.

167
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:33,872
Doesn't appear to be Native North American
or even Mayan, for that matter.

168
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,704
These are amazing.

169
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,818
Hey, Chloe, have you seen Pete today?
I think he skipped school.

170
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:53,721
I asked him to help me with the memorial
issue, but he totally blew me off. Why?

171
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,021
He's just acting strange.
I think Travis' death really got to him.

172
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,529
Well, Pete did try and save him,
but he just couldn't get there in time.

173
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:04,567
- Maybe, you know, he feels guilty.
- Definitely isn't acting that way.

174
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,772
Different people deal with grief
in different ways.

175
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,308
Any big plans for the weekend?

176
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,082
Do you know if they found drugs
in Travis' system?

177
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,017
The autopsy report was inconclusive.

178
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,419
They found a small puncture wound
on his neck...

179
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,753
...and his adrenal gland was
unusually enlarged.

180
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,554
Adrenaline gives you a rush.
Maybe that's why he jumped.

181
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,322
Yeah, but he wasn't the only one.

182
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,866
Two others at the rave, one from
Grandville, the other from Smallville...

183
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,369
...turned up dead. One took
a swan dive into an empty pool...

184
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,871
...and the other wrapped
his Corolla around a tree.

185
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,470
Same puncture wound...

186
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:50,046
...same enlarged adrenal gland
and same extreme behavior.

187
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,044
Yeah, it's like they all had a death wish.

188
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,618
- What do the police think?
- Somebody sticking them...

189
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,847
...with a new designer drug.

190
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,591
You think they got Pete?

191
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,957
I don't know, but I know I need to
get him to a doctor. See you later.

192
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,372
Yo, Clark!

193
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,342
What's up?

194
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,676
Pete, get down from there.

195
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,810
Pete, I have to get you to the hospital.

196
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,851
Something happened to you at the rave.

197
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,657
Sure, man, I'll be right there.

198
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,720
No!

199
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,165
You all right? You okay?

200
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,565
Oh, yeah!

201
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,402
That was amazing! Let's do it again.

202
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,805
- I'm getting you to a doctor.
- No! I feel great!

203
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,002
- You're coming with me.
- No, I'm not.

204
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:59,310
And if you take one more step,
I'm gonna tell all these people your secret!

205
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,650
I dare you.

206
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:06,288
He's an alien! He's an alien!
I'm not lying! He's an alien!

207
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,449
I'm telling the truth!

208
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,026
Look out, my best friend's an alien!

209
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,667
Whatever happened to Pete
started in this cave.

210
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,864
Have you gotten him to a doctor,
or is he as needle-phobic as you?

211
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:27,502
I haven't been able to find him. My dad
called the Rosses. They haven't seen him.

212
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,643
So, what exactly are we looking for?

213
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,112
I don't know.

214
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:35,617
A certain reporter friend of mine
always said to explore all options.

215
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,319
In that case, I'll look over here.

216
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,517
Okay. I'll check out the other chamber.

217
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,416
Hey!

218
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:11,217
This cave is off-limits. Why don't you find
somewhere else to make out?

219
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,057
You all right?

220
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,656
Yeah, I'm fine.

221
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,997
As for your snide remark...

222
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,533
...people haven't made out
in this cave since the 20th century.

223
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,103
Now, back off.

224
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,570
Hey, you're Fredrick Walden, the linguist.

225
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,338
- You wrote that book.
- I've written many books.

226
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:39,148
- Did Lex Luthor hire you?
- Thanks to you, Clark.

227
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,412
I'm counting on Professor Walden
to translate these pictographs.

228
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:46,718
- It'll help the preservation effort.
- Rule one, no guided tours.

229
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,986
They're friends of mine.
I didn't realize you'd accepted my offer.

230
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,630
I have, but we do things on my terms.

231
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,766
I don't allow anybody except for staff.

232
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,367
With all due respect, professor,
I found the caves.

233
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,868
I don't care if you discovered
the Shroud of Turin.

234
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:03,439
If you're unhappy with my method,
I can take the first flight to Chile.

235
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,539
- I'm sorry.
- Lex, you can't do this.

236
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,547
He's one of the most renowned linguists
in the world. If that's the way he works...

237
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,412
...we have to respect that.

238
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,681
Hey!

239
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,617
You get down from there.

240
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,553
Come on, Chloe, let's go.

241
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,660
What are you smiling at?
I want those photographs.

242
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,130
- Take your own.
- I'm serious, young lady.

243
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,862
You're the cunning linguist.
Why don't you translate this:

244
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:37,007
Kiss my ass.

245
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,193
Why did your dad call my parents?

246
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,665
- Pete, calm down.
- "Pete, calm down."

247
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,467
I thought you were my friend.

248
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:11,870
Pete, I think you're sick.

249
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:16,140
For a guy who likes privacy, you sure stick
your nose in other people's business.

250
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,548
- You x-raying me?
- There's something in you.

251
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,853
You need to come
to the medical center with me.

252
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,461
Try and touch me, you freak.

253
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,359
You're coming with me!

254
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,558
You think because you have those powers,
you always get your way.

255
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,896
News flash, I know your weakness.

256
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,705
Feels good, doesn't it?

257
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,376
Pete...

258
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,847
...how could you do this?

259
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,248
Back off, if you know
what's good for you.

260
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,590
Pete, come back!

261
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,251
I'm serious!

262
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,864
Come near me again, and I'll start
selling tickets to your storm cellar.

263
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,945
Run the new pigment sample
with the base-line chromatography.

264
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,945
Yes, doctor.

265
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:30,447
- I came as soon as I got your message.
- You need to see it with your own eyes.

266
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,182
We think it's some kind of parasite.

267
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,628
Found a nest of them
behind one of the glyphs.

268
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,994
It gets better.

269
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,466
- You know what it says?
- Not yet.

270
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,934
My people are working on it right now.

271
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:56,569
But I think it's meant
as some kind of warning against intruders.

272
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,150
- Are they poisonous?
- I wasn't gonna take any chances.

273
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,288
We destroyed the nest
with liquid nitrogen.

274
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,549
I wonder if the Kawatche tribe put
them here to protect the drawings.

275
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,659
Somebody did.

276
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,857
Do you have any live specimens left?

277
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:16,501
I want them sent to
Cadmus Labs in Metropolis.

278
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,999
Hey, Chloe, I need the...

279
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,110
Don't worry, Clark. We're done.

280
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,285
Can I get your number?

281
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:40,084
Why? The thrill is gone.

282
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,699
- Who was that?
- I don't know. I met him in the hall.

283
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:54,362
Thought he was cute. Asked him if he
wanted to do some investigative reporting.

284
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,171
Chloe, what's going on? Are you okay?

285
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:01,369
Oh, Clark, don't tell me you're jealous.
Thought you only had eyes for Lana.

286
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,210
Oh, I heard about your date...

287
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,277
...but, of course, it's not like
you have the guts to tell me.

288
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,052
Is that what this is about?

289
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,951
Don't flatter yourself, Clark.

290
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:15,753
I just wanted to explore my options,
take a risk.

291
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,824
So, what can I do for you?

292
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:25,027
Remember you said there was this
weird hole in the back of Travis' neck?

293
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,194
I was wondering if it could be from...

294
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,669
...some kind of parasite.

295
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,577
What orifice did you pull that one from?

296
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:39,083
- That's kind of harsh, isn't it?
- Come on, Clark.

297
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:43,153
It's not like you hit the mute button
on your skepticism when I take a logic leap.

298
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,811
It's just a hunch.

299
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,821
Travis' adrenal gland was abnormal.

300
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:50,553
Maybe the parasite was feeding off
his adrenaline, making him want more.

301
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:54,596
Don't you think they would have found
the parasite during the autopsy?

302
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,530
Not if it burrowed
out of that hole after he died.

303
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,862
All right, so, what do you need me for?

304
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:03,371
I can't get within 50 feet of Pete.
I figured you could talk to him.

305
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,042
Chloe, I'm sorry you're angry with me
about this date.

306
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,273
I thought we knew where we stood.

307
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,611
But the only thing I can think
about is Pete.

308
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,285
Sure, Clark.

309
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,254
I'll do it for you.

310
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,683
Just get him to your house.
I'll see you there.

311
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,454
It's a date.

312
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:46,646
Hey, you're early.
Wasn't expecting you for another hour.

313
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:50,046
Not that I mind.
I'm really excited about our date.

314
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,118
So was I.

315
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,817
Why are you speaking in the past tense?

316
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,387
Lana, I can't go out with you tonight.

317
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:03,397
If it wasn't a life-and-death situation,
I wouldn't break this date for anything.

318
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,464
What's going on?

319
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:10,767
It's Pete. Something happened to him. If
I don't get him to the hospital, he could die.

320
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,241
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- Chloe and I have it covered.

321
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:16,641
Okay.

322
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:21,115
I've done this to you in the past, and
I wanted you to have a reason this time.

323
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,922
It's not a problem.

324
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,456
We've waited this long,
what's another day?

325
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,833
Hey, lovebirds, look who I found.

326
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,163
Chloe, we were supposed
to meet at your house.

327
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:44,272
- Pete, how are you feeling?
- Awesome. I've never felt better in my life.

328
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,371
It sounded like you were
on your deathbed.

329
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,169
And you believed him?

330
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,372
Haven't you learned by now?

331
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,781
That's just Clark being Clark.

332
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,220
I guess not.

333
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,557
Pete, I need to get you help.

334
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:12,100
Whoa, Clark,
I know you're worried about me.

335
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:16,070
You're my boy. You always have been,
but I figured it out.

336
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,573
In your world, green means stop.

337
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,644
And red, red means go.

338
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,122
We're gonna have some fun now.

339
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,195
- Where are your parents?
- Looking for you.

340
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,956
- So, what's the plan?
- I don't know.

341
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:44,465
I was thinking maybe we go down
to Saunder's Gorge and jump the quarry.

342
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,900
- Lf we miss, Clark can catch us.
- Let's do it.

343
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,699
Yeah, right.

344
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,773
I'm serious.

345
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,408
Can we tell her?

346
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,780
I'm surprised she hasn't figured it out.

347
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:57,576
Figured out what?

348
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:02,751
Hey, Pete, you do the honors?

349
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:04,617
With pleasure.

350
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:15,560
It gets better.
Clark, it's a little dark in here.

351
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,410
- How did you...?
- Do that?

352
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,276
What are you?

353
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,415
Let's just say I'm not from around here.

354
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,689
- You knew about this?
- He's my brother...

355
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,085
...from another planet.

356
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,951
You should see the look
on your face right now.

357
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,425
Oh, my God.

358
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,499
This is so cool.

359
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,100
Can you fly?

360
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,636
Whoa, wait a minute.

361
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,435
I may be an alien, but I'm not a cartoon.

362
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,337
So if I fall...

363
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,841
...would you catch me?

364
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,016
Go for it.

365
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,894
My own personal superhero.

366
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:26,003
I always knew there was something
special about you, Clark Kent.

367
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,662
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

368
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:31,907
You are.

369
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:34,608
- Does he know?
- No.

370
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:38,180
I tell people who don't go around
stabbing me in the back and lying to me.

371
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,181
Clark, can I have a word with you?

372
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,712
- Alone?
- I'm busy.

373
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,913
Don't even worry about it, Clark.

374
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,148
It's cool.

375
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,221
We'll meet you in the car.

376
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,998
You know, I always wondered...

377
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:01,502
...for a boy who has
all the money in the world...

378
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,164
...you'd think he could afford
a good toupee.

379
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,317
What's going on, Clark?

380
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:19,146
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were on something.

381
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:22,782
We're just having a good time,
not that it's any of your business.

382
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:26,692
Ever heard of a phone? You come barging in
like you own the place. It's really...

383
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:30,357
I came here to tell you, Clark,
I talked to Walden.

384
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,437
- He won't budge.
- Or you don't want me in the cave?

385
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,802
Don't lie to me. You're Lex Luthor.

386
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:39,171
You pay a guy, he does what you tell him.
Isn't that the way it works?

387
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:42,541
- Clark...
- I'm gonna go in those caves when I please.

388
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,240
I dare you to stop me.

389
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,044
Is this really about a term paper?

390
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,752
You'd love to know, wouldn't you?

391
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:56,218
I'm gonna go. So are you.

392
00:29:56,594 --> 00:30:00,086
I like to see you standing up for yourself,
Clark, I really do.

393
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,431
Be careful not to cross the line.

394
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,866
Is that a threat?

395
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,797
- Just giving you friendly advice.
- Let me give you some back.

396
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,875
If you know what's good for you,
stay the hell away from me.

397
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:26,452
- Come on, Pete, go faster.
- I'm driving, I'm driving.

398
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:34,156
Hey, Clark, what other
superpowers you got?

399
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,425
Why don't you come back here
and find out.

400
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,566
Hey, hey, hey, this isn't a pimp-mobile.

401
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:44,168
- Dang, Chloe, never knew you had all that.
- Just keep your eyes on the road, Pete.

402
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,313
Guys, get a room.

403
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,711
Where's the fun in that, Pete?

404
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,486
I want you to make a quick
pit stop before we go to the gorge.

405
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,121
- Where?
- The Talon.

406
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,092
Oh, man.

407
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,193
Excuse me.

408
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,194
Hello!

409
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,297
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

410
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,705
- We're not going anywhere.
- Yeah, why don't you go get your manager.

411
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,780
So, what do you wanna do next?

412
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:29,411
- How about we play a game of strip poker?
- We don't have any cards.

413
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:30,918
Sure we do.

414
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,095
Full house.

415
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,289
Royal flush.

416
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,620
Chloe, we can't do this.

417
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,988
What...? What happened?
Why the sudden Jekyll and Hyde?

418
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,555
Don't tell me you're thinking about Lana.

419
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,255
This has nothing to do with Lana.

420
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,665
You don't have any real feelings for me,
do you?

421
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,336
Every time we hang out,
it's just to get answers.

422
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,936
Chloe, why don't you research this
or why don't you look up that?

423
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:29,102
I'm nothing more to you than your own
personal search engine, and I'm sick of it.

424
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,717
I want you, Clark.

425
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:43,788
- Chloe, you have the parasite.
- Well, I love the way I feel.

426
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,055
So maybe this is exactly what I need...

427
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:51,691
...to spend more time actually living life
and less time reporting it.

428
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,766
Lana, this is not what it looks like.

429
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,347
Yeah, it is, Lana.
It's exactly what it looks like.

430
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:06,312
Oh, and guess what,
Clark told me everything.

431
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:12,049
And I mean everything.

432
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:19,625
Lana, I can explain.

433
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:32,205
Chloe, you don't understand.
You're not yourself. You need a doctor.

434
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:35,107
What's all this doctor talk again?

435
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,440
What happened to my little red rock?

436
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,942
Pete, how could you do that to me?

437
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,347
Relax, you needed it.

438
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,489
Now, let's go jump the gorge.
You guys can suck face later.

439
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:48,454
No, Pete, I'm taking you
to an emergency room.

440
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,657
I don't care what you tell people about...

441
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,965
How'd you do that?

442
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,294
Clark's Achilles' heel.

443
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,765
He may be a boy scout,
but I'm always prepared.

444
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,375
Let's go.

445
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,956
Lana.

446
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,460
- Where's Chloe and Pete?
- I don't know.

447
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,625
And to be honest, I really don't care.

448
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,519
- Look at that drop.
- It'll be like flying.

449
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,353
- Who needs Clark?
- Yeah, screw Clark!

450
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,239
- We've got ignition!
- What are we waiting for? Blastoff!

451
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,028
- That was awesome!
- One more time, Clark!

452
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,790
- Oh, my God.
- Joy ride's over.

453
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,079
Hey.

454
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,517
Hey.

455
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,315
How you feeling?

456
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,321
Finally made the Wall of Weird.

457
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,185
Congratulations.

458
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:07,627
I heard about that thing
they extracted from me.

459
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,390
Did they get a picture I could see?

460
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,031
You don't need to see it.

461
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,100
It's gross?

462
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,535
- Pretty bad.
- How's Pete?

463
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,499
Pete's okay. He'll be fine.

464
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,075
Good.

465
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,269
So, what do you remember
about what happened?

466
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:26,179
Well, let's see, we were...

467
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,281
We were in the cave
talking to that obnoxious professor...

468
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,249
...and then...

469
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:34,880
...I was coming out of surgery.
Everything else is just blank.

470
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,959
Why? Did I miss anything exciting?

471
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,163
No...

472
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,800
...nothing exciting.

473
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,401
I'm glad you're okay.

474
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:49,972
Me too.

475
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,670
I'll just come back later.

476
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:58,740
It's okay, Lana. I was just leaving.

477
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,909
- I'll catch up with you later, okay?
- Promise?

478
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:04,577
Yeah.

479
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,620
Lana, I'm sorry.

480
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:18,531
I didn't come here to see you, Clark. I came
here to see my roommate. She's been ill.

481
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,169
- Hi.
- Hey.

482
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,736
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

483
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,071
Not that I really remember
everything that happened...

484
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,440
...but I have a feeling I should
be apologizing.

485
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:32,775
Oh, let's just say, you weren't yourself.

486
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,452
So I guess your date
with Clark was kind of a bust.

487
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,750
Did I screw it up?

488
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:43,817
Trust me, Clark screwed it up
all by himself.

489
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,394
What'd he do this time?

490
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,327
Well...

491
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,992
...I caught him making out
with another girl.

492
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,828
- Really?
- Yeah.

493
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,435
Who was the girl?

494
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,144
I didn't recognize her.

495
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:15,283
Clark, are you sure that Chloe
doesn't remember anything?

496
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,825
I can't believe Pete slipped you
a red meteor rock.

497
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:22,563
It wasn't entirely his fault.

498
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,428
Son, that's exactly the point.

499
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:28,402
He knew exactly what to do to control you,
and that's what scares us.

500
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,199
It scares me too, Mr. Kent.

501
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,003
Pete, hi. You're out.

502
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:37,978
Yeah, back to normal, whatever that is.

503
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,578
Listen, I'm really sorry
about what happened.

504
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:44,585
I don't even remember what I did.
Clark filled me in.

505
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:48,191
I just want to say that if you guys
never want to speak to me again...

506
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,759
...I'll understand.
- Pete...

507
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,197
...we knew the risks
when Clark told you his secret.

508
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,596
Our concern was always that it was
an unfair burden on you.

509
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:02,102
And as much as we'd like
to take it off your shoulders, we can't.

510
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:03,672
Besides...

511
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,274
...everybody stumbles.

512
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:09,168
The important thing is
you're safe, you're alive...

513
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,713
...and you're still a member of this family.

514
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,749
Whether you like it or not.

515
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,710
Thank you.

516
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,790
Professor.

517
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,961
I just got off the phone
with Cadmus Labs.

518
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,862
The dissection is done, I take it.

519
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:35,963
The creature's physiology
is completely unique.

520
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,574
Its DNA is unlike anything on this Earth.

521
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:44,077
Are you suggesting that these parasites
are somehow alien in origin?

522
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:47,149
I'm hoping the symbols on the walls
might answer that question.

523
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:50,446
- Then I'd better get to work.
- Before I allow you to continue...

524
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,613
...I'm afraid you're gonna have
to make a few concessions.

525
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:58,251
- We've already negotiated my fee.
- This isn't about money.

526
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:01,262
You're gonna give Clark Kent
unfettered access to the cave.

527
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:04,060
Just what exactly is your fascination
with this boy?

528
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:10,063
My instincts tell me Clark knows a lot more
about that cave than he's letting on.

529
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,762
What's this?

530
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,567
My pathetic attempt at an apology.

531
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,673
I plead temporary insanity.

532
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:52,205
It doesn't take a genius to see that you
and Chloe still have feelings for each other.

533
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,512
Lana, Chloe and I are just friends.

534
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,687
Obviously closer friends than we are.

535
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,822
Lana, that's not true.

536
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:05,519
Clark, you can't lie to me about something
I saw with my own eyes.

537
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:07,888
For once, just be honest with yourself.

538
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:12,061
I know why Chloe was kissing you.

539
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:13,999
But why were you kissing her back?

540
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,637
I have to lock up.

541
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
