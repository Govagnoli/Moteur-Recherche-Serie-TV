1
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:13,906
Twenty-four hour plumbing is a myth.

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,607
I've called every plumber in town.
No one can come before tomorrow morning.

3
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:21,117
By that time you'll need a snorkel.
Let me see what I can do.

4
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,681
Oh, wrong way.

5
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,190
The threads are history.
I need a wrench!

6
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:46,869
How did you do that?

7
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,914
I just kept twisting and turning
and it stopped.

8
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:01,287
Maybe one day I'll figure out how
Clark Kent does the things he does.

9
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,630
You know the people
who moved into your house?

10
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:11,693
They have this orange cat
that comes by the loft sometimes.

11
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:15,272
I try to talk to him, but he's not
half the conversationalist you are.

12
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,002
I have to admit,
I do miss those sunsets.

13
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,540
Yeah.

14
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,480
The sky's not really the same
when you see it alone.

15
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,519
It's getting late.

16
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,349
Yeah.

17
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,458
I should go put this back.

18
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,706
Any news from the military?

19
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:56,375
I'm really worried.
Whitney's been missing for over a month.

20
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,041
The military even sent back
his personal effects to his mom.

21
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,248
She gave me my necklace back.

22
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,171
You gonna start wearing that again?

23
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,035
Doesn't feel right.

24
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,178
Have to know he's safe first.

25
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,884
If anyone can get through it, Whitney can.

26
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,646
Thank you.

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,829
Aceh Province, Indonesia

28
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:56,172
This is pointless, Fordman.
They think we're dead.

29
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,367
We're gonna make it back home,
you hear me?

30
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,206
I'm gonna get back to see...

31
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,541
Lana? I know.

32
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,149
If I have to hear about Lana,
or Smallville...

33
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,583
...or horseback riding in the
freaking meadow one more time...

34
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,282
Move it! Move it!

35
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:25,167
- Keep moving!
- We're not gonna make it!

36
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,902
I got one flare left!
We just gotta make it to that ridge.

37
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,636
The scouts'll see it from there.

38
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,011
You all right?

39
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,982
Oh, my goodness!
You're okay. You're okay.

40
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,549
Come on, get up.

41
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,491
Come on, keep moving. Come on.

42
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,624
- You're okay, bud.
- I don't want to die, I don't want to die.

43
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,599
No one's gonna die. I promise.

44
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,893
Don't you guys think you're
overreacting a bit?

45
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,662
Not really. You spend your life thinking
you know the truth about someone...

46
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,964
...only to find out
that it may be a total lie.

47
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,473
They named the phone company after him.
Now Miss Biserri's telling us...

48
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,043
...Alexander Graham Bell
snaked somebody else's invention?

49
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,680
I haven't been this
disillusioned since I found out...

50
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,248
...that Betsy Ross didn't
design the American flag.

51
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,409
I mean, she was my role model.

52
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,520
Betsy Ross was your role model?

53
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,384
Yeah. In first grade.

54
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,583
I mean, one day she was a pioneer
for women, and then the next...

55
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,352
...she's a glorified seamstress.

56
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,589
One by one, our heroes are being defrocked.

57
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,899
You know, Lana, there's a winter festival
in Grandville this weekend.

58
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,541
My mom's gonna have
a booth there for her produce.

59
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,200
I was thinking maybe
we could go and hang out.

60
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,346
I'm not sure.

61
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,676
I have to take a couple of
extra shifts at the Talon.

62
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,546
I know you're worried...

63
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:56,052
...but working yourself to the bone
won't bring Whitney back any faster.

64
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,315
It's okay to have a little fun.

65
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,017
You're right.

66
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,662
So you'll go.

67
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,798
Yeah. Yeah, count me in.

68
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,973
Whitney.

69
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,748
I missed you so much.

70
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,185
I can't believe you're here.
I can't believe you're back.

71
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,611
Wow. It certainly is nice to hear
some good news for a change.

72
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,772
Mrs. Fordman must be so relieved.
That's wonderful.

73
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,508
Yeah.

74
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:36,378
Why do I get the impression that you
won't be the grand marshal...

75
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,787
...at Whitney's homecoming parade?
- I'm happy he's okay, I really am.

76
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,593
It's just...

77
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,162
I know this sounds selfish...

78
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,397
...but things were just starting
to get better between me and Lana...

79
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,595
...and now he's back.
- I thought Lana and Whitney had broken up.

80
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:56,208
So did I. But now she's throwing
him a party tonight at the Talon.

81
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,869
And you're going, right?

82
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,309
I don't know if I can stomach
seeing them together again.

83
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,280
Clark.

84
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,577
You need to put your
personal feelings aside, son.

85
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:12,918
Whitney risked his life for this country,
and he deserves a hero's welcome.

86
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,293
It's so nice to have things back to normal.

87
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:27,269
My son and the prettiest girl
in school together.

88
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,606
I bet you thought you'd never see me again.

89
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,349
I never gave up hope.

90
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,650
When I was out there, lost...

91
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:46,781
...the thought of seeing you again
was the only thing that kept me going.

92
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,560
What is it? What's wrong?

93
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,636
Whitney, you know
that video letter I sent you?

94
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,272
Video letter? What did it say?

95
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,241
Lana, there's something
you need to know about me.

96
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,548
When my platoon was ambushed...

97
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,485
...I was caught in an explosion...

98
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,285
...and when I woke up,
some of my memory was wiped out...

99
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,156
...and the doctors don't know
if I'll ever get it back.

100
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,356
Whitney, it's okay.

101
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:31,767
The one thing that I'll never forget
is how much I care for you.

102
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:35,305
I just want things to be
like they used to be.

103
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,754
Sorry I'm late.
I had a patient go into cardiac arrest...

104
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:59,023
...and saying "Sorry, I have a date"
might have come off as slightly insensitive.

105
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,861
Patient's fine now,
thanks for asking.

106
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:08,006
You told me you never met my father.

107
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,040
- Who took these photographs?
- A private investigator.

108
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,740
You had me followed?

109
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,818
No. I had my father followed.

110
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,547
Unless you both share
a passion for feeding pigeons...

111
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,850
...there must be a reason for your meeting.

112
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,583
How long have you been working for him?

113
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:33,729
Took me five dates to figure it out...
You're delusional.

114
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,892
A hundred thousand dollars wired into your
account from LuthorCorp. Is that a delusion?

115
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,164
- You checked my bank account?
- After I discovered you were having...

116
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,900
...tete-a-tete with my father,
I ran a background check.

117
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:47,842
I imagine those two weeks a year you spend
in Rwanda treating orphan children...

118
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,448
...does wonders for your conscience.

119
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,413
Who are you?

120
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,913
Someone who's been burned
by the opposite sex...

121
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,920
...more times than he cares to admit.

122
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,853
So tell me.

123
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,256
Why does a Harvard-educated physician...

124
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,521
...a woman of supposed integrity...

125
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:09,634
...accept a six-figure sum to spy on a man
she claims to have feelings for?

126
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,633
First of all...

127
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,568
...I don't recall claiming
anything of the sort.

128
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,641
And second of all,
if you think I'm gonna put up...

129
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,371
...with your pathetic, paranoid attempts
at invading my privacy...

130
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:24,812
...you're even more arrogant
than everyone said you were.

131
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,865
Unless the bathrobe passes for
haute couture these days...

132
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,303
...I'm guessing someone's
not ready for the party.

133
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,670
I don't know how this day
slipped by so fast.

134
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,243
I was over at Whitney's...

135
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:57,439
...Iooking at some old photos,
trying to refresh his memory.

136
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,611
How's he doing?

137
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:03,619
You know, surprisingly well,
considering everything he's been through.

138
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,657
Did he mention your
award-winning Dear John video?

139
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,761
He doesn't remember ever seeing it.

140
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,521
He thinks we're still a couple.

141
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,165
Well, that's got to be awkward.

142
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,998
I can't turn my back on him now.

143
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,869
He needs me more than ever.

144
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,134
Could Lana Lang be falling
for the man in uniform?

145
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,834
Why would you say that?

146
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:30,311
I don't know. I just sense that this
may not be just a Florence Nightingale...

147
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,077
...nursing a wounded soldier.

148
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,078
I don't know how to feel, you know?
It's happening so fast.

149
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,349
But seeing him again...

150
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:43,791
...a lot of those feelings came back,
feelings I thought were long gone.

151
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:47,231
Hence the 45-minute wardrobe crisis.

152
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:53,865
The thing with Whitney
is that what you see is what you get.

153
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,406
There are no mysteries.
No deep, dark secrets.

154
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,807
Unlike someone we know.

155
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:19,493
Catch any tape-delayed Sharks games?
They're burying the entire league.

156
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,963
I'm not that interested
in football these days.

157
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:26,161
If you're up for it, I'd love to set up an
exclusive interview with you for the Torch.

158
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,863
I actually don't remember that much...

159
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,340
...and what I do remember,
I'd rather not talk about.

160
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:36,775
Now that I'm back home, I'd rather
focus on the more important things in life.

161
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:38,978
Great.

162
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,283
Hey, Clark.

163
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,583
- Whitney, good to have you back.
- Hey, Fordman!

164
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,785
- Yeah.
- Hey, dude, how you been, man?

165
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,793
Listen, Clark, about Saturday.

166
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,694
No, it's okay. I understand.

167
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,428
What's going on this Saturday?

168
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,432
Nothing.

169
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,503
I take it you two saw a lot
of each other while I was gone?

170
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,107
No, not especially.

171
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,078
Clark and I are just friends, Whitney.

172
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,053
I'm gonna get some punch.

173
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,667
How could I have been so stupid?

174
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,649
Whitney, what's going on?

175
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,513
What's going on with you and Lana?

176
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,313
Nothing.

177
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,922
I kept my promise.
I looked out for her, that's it.

178
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,355
Oh, yeah, you're a real class act, Kent.

179
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:57,461
I go off and fight for my country
and you stab me in the back...

180
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,326
...by trying to steal my girl.
- That's not what happened.

181
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,099
How'd you do that to the door?

182
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:08,471
I'm a trained U.S. Marine, Clark.
There's a lot of things I can do.

183
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,801
Stay away from Lana.

184
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,588
Lana? We need to talk.

185
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,226
About what happened in the Talon?

186
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,955
- Could have apologized over the phone.
- What are you talking about?

187
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,725
Whitney said he walked in on you
wrecking the bathroom.

188
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,561
He said you were in a jealous rage.

189
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,703
No, he was the one
tearing up the bathroom.

190
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,032
He said you told him
to stay away from me.

191
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,835
What? I didn't say that. He's lying.

192
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:48,044
After everything he's been through,
now you're calling him a liar?

193
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,607
I can't believe you.

194
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:30,020
Ma'am, I'm Lieutenant McNulty,
United States Marine Corps. May I come in?

195
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,783
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

196
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,729
Are you here to see Whitney?

197
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,231
I beg your pardon?

198
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,632
Hey, what's up, lieutenant?

199
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,196
There must be some mistake.

200
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,239
Mistake? What do you mean?

201
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,242
Ma'am, according to my superiors,
your son is actually...

202
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,223
I haven't seen Heisman in so long.

203
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:16,060
You know what I miss the most?

204
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,303
Times like this when it's just the two of us.

205
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,536
Hey, you're wearing your necklace.

206
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,304
Whenever I pictured you in my mind,
you always had it on.

207
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,970
I haven't worn it since they sent it back.

208
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,845
I wanted to know that you were safe first.

209
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,713
Sent back?

210
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,580
Oh, I gave it to you
when you left for basic training.

211
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:41,692
They sent it back to your mom
when you were listed as missing.

212
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,588
Why can't I remember?

213
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:50,501
I know how hard this must be for you. But
isn't the important thing that you're alive?

214
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,797
You know, that you're back
with people that care about you?

215
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,803
Lana, I've been thinking.

216
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,374
Now that Nell's gone, maybe...

217
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,215
Maybe we should move in together.

218
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,553
Whitney, we...

219
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,212
We can't move in together.

220
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,851
This is about Clark, isn't it?

221
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,555
- I told you, Clark and I are just friends.
- He's got secrets, Lana.

222
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,164
- What kind of secrets?
- You should be careful.

223
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,596
He's not what he seems.

224
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,261
- How do you know?
- Can we just not talk about Clark?

225
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,336
Lana, I'm sorry. I didn't...

226
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,469
I didn't mean to freak you out with
that whole moving-in thing. I just...

227
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,445
I just want to be with you all the time.

228
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,914
It's okay.

229
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,523
Who knows what kind of inside information
she's given him about my company.

230
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,939
Lex, you've been dating Helen for a while.

231
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:04,906
Nothing you ever told me would lead me
to believe she's the espionage type.

232
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,880
I'm afraid one day you'll learn
the frustrating truth.

233
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,744
People are seldom whom they appear to be.

234
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,951
Did she give you any kind of explanation?

235
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,112
Didn't get that far. When she learned
that I had her investigated...

236
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,053
...she turned hostile and stormed out.

237
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:23,956
If I knew someone was investigating me,
I'd be a little ticked off too.

238
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,990
You want to know
the most pathetic part about it?

239
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:33,104
The first time I actually pictured a
future with a woman beyond two months.

240
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,002
Did you ask her to explain
her side of the story?

241
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,439
May not be what it looks like.

242
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,545
I wish I shared your eternal optimism, Clark.

243
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,448
I'm not sure how much
of an optimist I've been lately.

244
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:51,052
Now that the quarterback's returned, you're
back at your own one-yard line with Lana?

245
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,290
Be patient.

246
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,892
Most quarterbacks' careers
don't last that long.

247
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,864
It's not just that.

248
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:04,165
I mean, I'm worried about him.
Since he's been back, he's been acting...

249
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:07,328
...bizarre. Like he's someone else.

250
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,667
He might be suffering from
post-traumatic stress.

251
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,036
Some employees
went through it after the tornado.

252
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,203
I sent them to a specialist in Metropolis.
They're doing better.

253
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,577
- Maybe this specialist could help Whitney.
- It's worth a try.

254
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,548
If you want, I can get him
an appointment this week.

255
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,278
Yeah, thanks.

256
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,486
What happened to you?

257
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,750
Answer the question!

258
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,791
What is my favorite radio station?

259
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,429
I don't know.

260
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:36,694
When I get in the car with Lana,
that radio has to be on the right station.

261
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,665
What is it?

262
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,539
It's the one that plays the loud rock.

263
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:47,839
I think that there's a sticker
on one of your old schoolbooks.

264
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,004
Please...

265
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,792
What do you want now, Kent?

266
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,169
Look, Whitney, I know
we've had our differences in the past...

267
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,067
...but before you left,
I thought we had an understanding.

268
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,003
- I'm worried about you.
- About what?

269
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,267
You've been through a lot.

270
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,503
Lex told me about this doctor
who deals with post-traumatic stress.

271
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,672
If you're trying to break me and Lana up,
it's not gonna work.

272
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,717
I know you've had a thing for her.
You always have.

273
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,354
It's one of Clark Kent's many secrets.

274
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:33,514
Whitney, this has nothing to do with Lana.
You need help.

275
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:36,820
What I need
is for you to stay out of my life.

276
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,153
Shut up!

277
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,223
Clark, what's going on?

278
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,801
I know this may sound crazy,
but Whitney may not be Whitney.

279
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,962
Are you getting existential on us,
or is this Wall of Weird material?

280
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,471
I think he's Tina Greer.

281
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,269
The mighty morphing power girl?

282
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,344
- What?
- The girl who was Lex, then Lana...

283
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,743
...and then locked up.
- I know who she is, but it's impossible.

284
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,781
Why? She was obsessed with Lana,
remember?

285
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:36,352
Maybe she escaped to see her.
Who better to impersonate than Whitney?

286
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,318
She couldn't pull a Martin Guerre.

287
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,821
- Why not?
- Because she's dead.

288
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,050
- What?
- She committed suicide last week.

289
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,457
I'm running a story on it on page two.

290
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,494
- What happened?
- The authorities said...

291
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:50,931
...she went into the art-therapy room at the
hospital, doused herself in paint thinner...

292
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,162
...and lit a match.
- Okay, now that's nasty.

293
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,931
I know. Tina wrote a note saying...

294
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:59,009
...she didn't know who she was anymore.
She couldn't take it.

295
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,011
Did they ID her dental records?

296
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,480
There's something else about Tina.

297
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,749
I think she may know about my abilities.

298
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,087
- You think?
- I had to use them to stop her.

299
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:20,095
Once she was declared insane,
I figured I didn't have to worry.

300
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,630
Well, you gotta worry now.

301
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,893
What about the meteor rocks?
Does she know?

302
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,594
Yeah, she used
Lana's necklace against me.

303
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,069
You better be careful, man.

304
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,140
I'm gonna go find Tina. You warn Lana.

305
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,242
Warn me about what?

306
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,609
Lana, this may be hard
for you to understand, but...

307
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,316
...we may think that
Whitney's actually Tina Greer.

308
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,052
Why would you say that?

309
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,914
- You just have to believe me.
- This is just insane.

310
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,229
I know it's a lot to process, but it's true.

311
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,964
I'm going to the Fordmans',
you stay here with Pete till I get back.

312
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,070
I need some time alone.

313
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,607
I understand, Lana,
but that freak is dangerous.

314
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,408
I know.

315
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,120
You're Tina.

316
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,241
Who you calling a freak?

317
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,474
Mrs. Fordman?

318
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,551
Mrs. Fordman?

319
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,561
Are you okay?

320
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,633
- Where's Whitney?
- I don't know.

321
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,433
Whoever it is, it is not my son.

322
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,137
That girl, she's some kind of monster.

323
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:14,938
Okay.

324
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,507
Lana, we have to talk.

325
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,708
Could you give me a second?
It's kind of...

326
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,218
It can't wait. Sit down.

327
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,215
Lana...

328
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,723
...will you marry me?

329
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,763
I understood why you didn't
want to move in together...

330
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:40,166
Now it'll be legal,
and we can elope and get out of Smallville.

331
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:43,933
Whitney, this is crazy.
You know I'm still in high school.

332
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:48,546
My mom was only 16 when
she married my dad. This is her ring.

333
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,718
I'm sorry.

334
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,944
I can't accept it.

335
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,850
Why not?

336
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,356
Whitney, that...

337
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,392
That video letter I sent you.

338
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:07,965
There were some things that I said...

339
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,158
...that I can't keep from you anymore.

340
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,893
Like what?

341
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:15,063
I said that I...

342
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,240
I told you I thought we should
go our separate ways.

343
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,576
I didn't want to say anything
when you said you couldn't remember.

344
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:28,913
You've been through so much,
and I didn't want to hurt you like that.

345
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,256
I will always...

346
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,755
...care about you, Whitney.

347
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:37,156
- But you care more about Clark.
- This has nothing to do with Clark.

348
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,093
Don't lie to me.

349
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:44,926
Look me in the eye and tell me
you don't have feelings for him.

350
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,769
I have to get back to work.

351
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,438
It's okay.

352
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,170
It's okay.

353
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:58,746
Thing that combat taught me is how to...

354
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,080
...deal with loss...

355
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:03,117
...and move on.

356
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,750
I'm sorry.

357
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,459
If I could just ask you for one thing.

358
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,761
Of course.

359
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,163
Your necklace...
Do you think I could have it? L...

360
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:22,938
It's just something to remember you by.
I know it means a lot to you.

361
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,574
It does.

362
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,209
That's why I want you to have it.

363
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,361
Hey, Dad.

364
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,229
Oh, hi, Clark.

365
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,871
Say, how's Mrs. Fordman doing?

366
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,269
They're gonna keep her overnight.

367
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,800
She's pretty freaked out
by this whole thing.

368
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:00,672
Who could blame her, right?

369
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,349
Any idea where Tina is now?

370
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,984
No.

371
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,546
She could be anyone.

372
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,887
You're right about that.

373
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,965
I always wondered
how you beat me, Clark.

374
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:30,900
You should be dead, but you're not.

375
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,940
The meteor shower must have
done something to you too.

376
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,939
Looks painful.

377
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,054
Tina, don't do this.

378
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,418
If I want to be with Lana...

379
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:49,617
...I don't have a choice.

380
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,897
Last year...

381
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,463
...you threatened to kill her.

382
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:58,261
Yeah. It was the worst mistake of my life.

383
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,564
She rejected me,
and I acted without thinking.

384
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,308
But I love her...

385
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,808
...and I'll do anything to be with her.

386
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:13,114
And I finally figured out
who Lana wants to be with.

387
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,154
It's gonna be easy to become you, Clark.

388
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,847
No. Stay away from her.

389
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,889
You have the perfect life.

390
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,453
Great parents, good friends.

391
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:30,567
And most importantly, the girl of our dreams
waiting for you to finally make a move.

392
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,404
No!

393
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:52,453
I'm not used to people ignoring my calls.

394
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,390
- I have to get to work.
- Look, you can at least...

395
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,962
...offer me some kind of explanation.

396
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,928
Your father did approach me, Lex.

397
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,568
He did offer me money,
but not to spy on you.

398
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,101
Then what did he want?

399
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,034
He wanted me to dump you.

400
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:12,108
Even after I told him to go to hell,
he wired the money anyway.

401
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,445
So I guess he succeeded
in exactly what he set out to do.

402
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,171
Break us up.

403
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:21,079
You're telling me my father offered you
$ 100,000 against your will?

404
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,549
Why would he do that?

405
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,178
I can't even begin to fathom the depths
of the Luthor family pathology.

406
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:29,087
- You could have told me.
- I was about to...

407
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,560
...but before I could say a word, I realized
I was in the middle of an interrogation.

408
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,863
Helen.

409
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,734
- Lf I had known...
- No, no, no.

410
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,737
I'm glad that this happened.

411
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:46,706
It showed me
who I was really dealing with.

412
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:50,637
You know, I've done some
pretty stupid things in my life...

413
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:54,342
...but this could possibly win
the Nobel Prize for stupidity.

414
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:57,849
I fell for someone
who never really existed.

415
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,981
Hey.

416
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:37,246
Sorry. I hope you don't mind. I...

417
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,285
I need... I'm sock-deprived.

418
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,550
All my clothes are stuck on spin.

419
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:45,856
Well, go ahead.
I've gotta go to the Talon and close out.

420
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,897
I bumped into Whitney.
He told me what happened.

421
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,267
Is he okay?

422
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,040
Well, he said you're not
an easy girl to get over...

423
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,200
...but he knows you'll be happy with Clark.

424
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,006
I told him this has nothing to do with Clark.

425
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,446
Come on, Lana,
it's obvious you two belong together.

426
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:11,046
Okay, now you're starting to act strange.

427
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,220
- Why?
- Well, given your past history with Clark...

428
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:19,886
...I'm surprised you're so eager
to play matchmaker.

429
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,803
Don't think it's easy for me, Lana.

430
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:33,106
I just don't want to stand in the way
of what's meant to be.

431
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,078
Sorry.

432
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:48,518
Clark!

433
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,659
He's down here!

434
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,593
Clark! Son.

435
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:58,331
- Are you all right? What happened?
- The ship saved me.

436
00:33:58,503 --> 00:33:59,765
How'd it do that?

437
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,667
I don't know,
but look what it did to the necklace.

438
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,806
Oh, my God.

439
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,604
I have to save Lana.

440
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,713
Wait, Clark.

441
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:33,066
- Hey.
- Sorry. Did I scare you?

442
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,637
No, I just... I wasn't expecting
to see anyone this late.

443
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,371
Lana, there's something I should tell you.

444
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,345
When I saw you with Whitney,
I realized that...

445
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:49,247
...if I didn't act on my true feelings,
I could lose you forever.

446
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,553
Did someone put something
in the water supply?

447
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:55,214
Because everyone's
acting really strange today.

448
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,692
I'm acting the way I should have
acted the first time I met you.

449
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,630
Lana, I love you.

450
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,137
Clark.

451
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,759
- Get away from her!
- What's going on?

452
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:31,053
I'll explain everything when
I get you away from Tina.

453
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,760
- Tina?
- No, Lana. That's Tina.

454
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,595
- Lana, it's me, Clark.
- Don't listen to him. He's lying.

455
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:40,430
The guy who fixed the leaky drain pipe.

456
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:46,505
- No, we're supposed to be together.
- Stay away from me, you freak!

457
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,144
No!

458
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,974
You ruined everything!

459
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,889
I'm gonna kick your ass, Kent.

460
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,333
Bring it on.

461
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:49,701
Tina! Listen to me.

462
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,705
You don't have to do this.
You can stop.

463
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,571
I can help you.

464
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,949
Why don't you just die?

465
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,087
Tina.

466
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:21,229
Take care of Lana.

467
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,058
How's Mrs. Fordman?

468
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:48,025
The military officer that Tina murdered...

469
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:52,192
...was coming to tell Mrs. Fordman
that they had found Whitney's body.

470
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:57,196
- Whitney died in combat.
- Oh, my God!

471
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:00,640
- Oh, that's horrible.
- Yeah.

472
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,010
Clark?

473
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,547
Have you seen Lana?

474
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,713
Chloe said she's not ready
to see anyone yet.

475
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,119
Sweetheart, are you all right?

476
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,457
I just can't help thinking that...

477
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:20,996
...Whitney's skin wasn't bulletproof.

478
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:24,498
His bones weren't unbreakable,
but he still put himself in harm's way...

479
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,637
...so the world could be safer.

480
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:31,531
I wonder if I didn't have my abilities,
if I'd have the same kind of courage.

481
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,844
Son, there is no doubt...

482
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,284
...in our minds...

483
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,219
...that you would.

484
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,614
Lex.

485
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:17,850
What I did was inexcusable.

486
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:21,656
I violated your privacy.
I should have trusted you.

487
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,953
It's a little late for apologies.

488
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:25,595
From the time I was born...

489
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:28,926
...I was raised in an environment
of suspicion and distrust.

490
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,031
My father taught me to regard everyone
as an adversary, no matter who they are.

491
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,695
I'm sorry you had to grow up like that,
I am, but...

492
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,966
When my mother died...

493
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:41,111
...I began to build a wall around my heart.

494
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:45,247
Every year that wall grew
taller and more fortified...

495
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:48,283
...till eventually it became impenetrable.

496
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:52,418
I want to tear the wall down,
Helen, I do. I just...

497
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,115
I don't have the slightest clue
how to do it.

498
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:02,992
Lex...

499
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:07,801
I've never once asked anyone for help,
but I'm asking you now.

500
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,870
Help me, Helen.

501
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,443
I don't want to become my father.

502
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,356
I called your house.

503
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,965
Your mom said you were down here.

504
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,559
I am so sorry.

505
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:16,569
I never should have sent that video.

506
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,733
Don't do that to yourself.

507
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,376
He was missing in action...

508
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:25,674
...fighting for his life,
thinking that I wasn't there...

509
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,681
...that I didn't care.

510
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,376
It's not your fault.

511
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,590
Seems like...

512
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:39,491
...every person that I've ever
gotten close to just leaves.

513
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:44,089
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it is.

514
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,830
My parents, Nell...

515
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,472
...now Whitney.

516
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:58,770
I know I haven't been a good friend.

517
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:04,581
- You've been a great friend.
- No, I have doubted you...

518
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:08,919
...accused you of things,
and still you're here, protecting me.

519
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:15,429
I don't care if you have secrets, Clark.

520
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:21,730
You are the one good, constant thing
in my life, and I don't want to lose you too.

521
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:28,410
I'm not going anywhere.

522
