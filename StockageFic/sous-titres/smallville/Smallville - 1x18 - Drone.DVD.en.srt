1
00:00:28,514 --> 00:00:32,416
Hey, Sasha,
say something presidential.

2
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:37,715
Whoa, Chloe, slow down.
The election hasn't even started yet.

3
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:41,357
What do you think Sasha's chances are?

4
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:45,190
Well, she knows the most about student
government, she's worked her way up...

5
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:49,825
...she's on a ton of committees,
but she's more of a worker than a leader.

6
00:00:50,803 --> 00:00:52,270
How about Paul?

7
00:00:52,438 --> 00:00:54,406
He's certainly the most qualified...

8
00:00:54,574 --> 00:00:57,975
...but elections aren't about merit,
they're about popularity.

9
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:00,703
Which brings us to Felice.

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,144
Head cheerleader and president
of the drama club.

11
00:01:03,316 --> 00:01:06,717
That definitely gives her an edge,
not to mention that she's really hot.

12
00:01:06,886 --> 00:01:10,151
Yeah, but her name rhymes with
the French word for luggage.

13
00:01:10,323 --> 00:01:14,589
Okay, glad to see you're not
reaching for reasons to hate her.

14
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:21,064
I saw you taking Sasha's picture.

15
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:24,362
Why haven't you taken mine?
That qualifies as biased.

16
00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:29,804
I plan on running photos and bios of all
the candidates, including you, Felice.

17
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:33,073
Hey, Chloe, what about the editorial?

18
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:35,806
You can only endorse one candidate,
so who's it gonna be?

19
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:39,844
Who cares? No matter what she says,
people are gonna vote for me.

20
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:44,422
Never underestimate the need for the
clinically ambitious to pad their resumes.

21
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:49,852
You want to avoid
the pain and humiliation of losing?

22
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:52,462
Drop out now.

23
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:48,551
Ow!

24
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,166
That's gotta be my all-time
worst nightmare.

25
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:46,897
I get stung by one bee, I swell up
like a grapefruit, but over a hundred....

26
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:49,007
How'd they get into Paul's bathroom?

27
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:51,143
The Center for Environmental Protection...

28
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,778
...is sending a team
from Metropolis to investigate.

29
00:04:53,946 --> 00:04:56,073
Guess that's gonna
shake up our class election.

30
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:59,218
Not really. I mean, Paul's name
is still on the ballot...

31
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:02,513
...and he wouldn't take office until fall.
He could recover by then.

32
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:04,679
Out of sight, out of mind.

33
00:05:04,857 --> 00:05:07,087
My call, he gets a few sympathy votes.
That's it.

34
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,922
-Nice to see the softer side of Pete.
-Seriously.

35
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:14,226
Anyway, there's a new candidate on the
horizon who is gonna make things interesting.

36
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,334
Oh, yeah, who's that?

37
00:05:20,873 --> 00:05:24,070
-What have you done?
-I see a big future ahead of you in politics.

38
00:05:24,243 --> 00:05:26,040
You're straightforward.
People like you.

39
00:05:26,912 --> 00:05:29,437
-No way. Definitely not.
-You've got the whole package:

40
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:32,175
Looks, brains, and that whole
farm-boy charm.

41
00:05:33,352 --> 00:05:34,979
Did I mention the perks of power?

42
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:38,419
-lf it was so great, why didn't you run?
-I know my strengths.

43
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:41,253
I'm more the power behind the throne.

44
00:05:41,427 --> 00:05:44,555
The guy behind the guy.
The one who makes it all happen.

45
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,698
-Pete Ross, the kingmaker.
-Exactly.

46
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:50,632
All you gotta do is show up, shake
a couple hands, give a speech. It's easy.

47
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:53,863
And we wonder why our politicians
aren't great leaders.

48
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,771
<i>Clark, Clark, Clark, Clark....</i>

49
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:33,873
-You look like you could use some help.
-No, I'm fine.

50
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:38,005
Hans, I need you out on Route 90,
two miles east of the mansion.

51
00:06:38,184 --> 00:06:41,210
-A red Mustang with engine trouble.
-What are you doing?

52
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:43,082
Calling my mechanic.

53
00:06:43,255 --> 00:06:47,783
Not that I don't appreciate your attempt
at postmodern chivalry, but I said I was fine.

54
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,758
Dolce & Gabbana and a vocabulary?

55
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,525
You've got Metropolis written all over you.
What brings you to Smallville?

56
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,861
You're the sheriff
come to run me out of town?

57
00:06:57,036 --> 00:07:00,699
Did the attitude come with the couture,
or was it an accessory?

58
00:07:00,873 --> 00:07:03,398
If you must know,
I'm thinking about moving here.

59
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:07,171
I'd ask you what it's like,
but you don't look like a local.

60
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:11,976
I've lived here since last fall. I couldn't
wait to get out, but it's growing on me.

61
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:15,780
Well, why the change?
The Norman Rockwell ambiance seduce you?

62
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:19,322
Appearance is deceptive.
Nothing around here is what it seems.

63
00:07:19,492 --> 00:07:22,518
I'm intrigued. What do you mean?

64
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:26,358
All these questions. This is
beginning to sound like an interview.

65
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:36,039
-Who do you work for?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

66
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:40,838
If I toss these into the woods,
you really are gonna need a tow truck.

67
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:46,182
<i>Carrie Castle. I'm a staff reporter
for the Metropolis Journal.</i>

68
00:07:46,786 --> 00:07:48,754
I don't grant interviews, Ms. Castle.

69
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:52,550
I've spent most of my life taking
back entrances to avoid people like you.

70
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:55,717
Wait. Just listen.
I want to write an article about you.

71
00:07:57,897 --> 00:08:01,025
That's your pitch? There are articles
written about me all the time.

72
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,000
But you're either dismissed as a wild child
or the spoiled son of Lionel Luthor.

73
00:08:05,304 --> 00:08:07,431
<i>You've gotten some good press
in the Inquisitor...</i>

74
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:12,509
<i>...but the Journal is not a tabloid. It's
respected. It could help change your image.</i>

75
00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:16,045
-What did you have in mind?
-A cover profile on your work in Smallville.

76
00:08:16,215 --> 00:08:17,739
It will be fair and accurate...

77
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:21,284
...and will give you the legitimacy you need
to get out of your father's shadow.

78
00:08:21,454 --> 00:08:23,547
Launching my career
and conveniently your own.

79
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:28,916
I admire the effort, Ms. Castle,
but I have to decline.

80
00:08:31,497 --> 00:08:33,988
You get points for style, though.

81
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:48,406
I can't believe Pete did this.

82
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:52,517
Some men are born to greatness, others are
dragged into it, kicking and screaming.

83
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:55,119
Clark? What's going on?
Why are you running?

84
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:57,585
You've never shown interest
in student government.

85
00:08:57,756 --> 00:09:00,122
Don't worry, it's just a gag.
Pete nominated me.

86
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:02,419
-So you're taking your name off the ballot?
-Yeah.

87
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:06,087
Well, good, because this election
is way too important to turn into a joke.

88
00:09:06,265 --> 00:09:07,857
It's bad enough with Felice.

89
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:11,594
I hear she's throwing a pre-election bash
with a band and catering.

90
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:17,507
She is trying to buy this election
like one of her Prada bags!

91
00:09:18,744 --> 00:09:21,406
Talk about tightly wound.

92
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,640
Not that I'm planning to, but if I ran,
you think I'd have a shot?

93
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,251
Yeah, right after I'm elected
head cheerleader.

94
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,852
Clark Kent for president?

95
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:39,156
Oh, don't worry,
I'm pulling my name out tomorrow.

96
00:09:39,698 --> 00:09:41,723
-I think this is a terrific idea.
-You do?

97
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:46,361
You always say that you don't get a chance
to shine because football is off-limits...

98
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:49,064
-...maybe this is your opportunity.
-I assumed you'd say no.

99
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:53,234
-Student government is such a public thing.
-It doesn't require you to use your gifts...

100
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:56,506
...and it's a school activity
you can make your own.

101
00:09:56,882 --> 00:10:00,181
Hey, what's the matter, son?
You don't look too happy about this.

102
00:10:00,352 --> 00:10:01,683
Hey-- Hey.

103
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:05,556
I've always tried to stay
out of the spotlight.

104
00:10:05,724 --> 00:10:07,658
Well, nobody's saying you have to run.

105
00:10:07,826 --> 00:10:11,557
You can quit if you want, but remember,
quitting's a very hard habit to break.

106
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:16,531
No pressure.

107
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:28,104
Wow, the place is....

108
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,440
Empty?

109
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:31,082
Deserted?

110
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,842
Vacant?

111
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:36,681
Well, I was searching for a euphemism
to say that, but...yeah.

112
00:10:36,855 --> 00:10:39,688
The Beanery's tried to put us
out of business since we opened.

113
00:10:39,858 --> 00:10:42,622
<i>I have tried coupons, price cuts,
even ads in the Ledger...</i>

114
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:46,993
...so far nothing's worked. At this rate,
we'll have to close the doors in a month.

115
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,602
Have you spoken to Lex?
He's an investor, I'm sure he can help.

116
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:53,101
He's been uncharacteristically silent.

117
00:10:53,272 --> 00:10:58,209
Besides, this is my battle to win or lose,
and I am determined to win.

118
00:10:58,377 --> 00:11:02,313
Speaking of which, I hear you've got
a battle of your own on your hands.

119
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:05,644
Oh, yeah, the election.
I'm not really running.

120
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:09,345
That's too bad. I think
you'd make a great class president.

121
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:10,954
-Really?
-Yeah.

122
00:11:11,123 --> 00:11:14,786
You're honest, people trust you.
And you have this innate sense of justice.

123
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,624
I can see it on your face how upset you get
when you think somebody's being mistreated.

124
00:11:19,798 --> 00:11:22,460
-You see all that in me?
-Yes, I do.

125
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:32,607
Clark Kent for president.

126
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:35,144
How'd you know I was running?

127
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:37,680
I found this on my windshield in town.

128
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,216
I have an overzealous campaign manager.

129
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:42,820
I didn't realize you had political aspirations.

130
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:45,582
I don't. I just figured
I could make a difference.

131
00:11:45,758 --> 00:11:49,785
Did you swing by
for a campaign contribution?

132
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:53,422
Actually, I was wondering
if you knew about the Talon.

133
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:56,159
You mean the fact that it's been
empty the last two weeks?

134
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:58,895
Do you plan on helping Lana out?
She's tried everything.

135
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:02,131
She's doing an admirable job.

136
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,104
-lf the Talon goes under....
-Clark...

137
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:09,473
...I won't subsidize a money-losing operation.
The Talon has to find its own feet.

138
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:13,084
Well, you could at least stop by
and show some solidarity.

139
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:16,449
See? You're already working
for your constituents.

140
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:20,153
You want some advice?

141
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:23,021
I think you need a better slogan.

142
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:26,159
Everybody's used this one, including me.

143
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:30,133
-You ran for student office.
-Once.

144
00:12:30,302 --> 00:12:33,328
-But my aspirations weren't very noble.
-Did you win?

145
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:36,072
Of course.

146
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:38,141
Do you have any tips?

147
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,474
You don't need my methods.
You'll win on your own terms.

148
00:12:42,648 --> 00:12:44,013
Competition's pretty stiff.

149
00:12:44,183 --> 00:12:46,413
There's nothing wrong with a good fight.
Remember...

150
00:12:46,585 --> 00:12:50,385
...the man of tomorrow
is forged by his battles today.

151
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,126
Could I use that? I mean,
"the man of tomorrow," for my slogan?

152
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:59,627
Knock yourself out.

153
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:16,575
"Clark Kent, man of tomorrow."
Kind of presumptuous, don't you think?

154
00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:19,149
-I like it.
-I thought you were bagging the election.

155
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:21,479
I had a change of heart.

156
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:23,746
"Man of tomorrow."
Very catchy.

157
00:13:23,922 --> 00:13:26,254
Thank you.
And thank you for the encouragement.

158
00:13:26,425 --> 00:13:27,585
You've got my vote.

159
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,923
I could have my election rally
at the Talon, help bring people by.

160
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:34,259
That sounds great.
You know where to find me.

161
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:35,593
-Bye, Lana.
-Bye.

162
00:13:36,468 --> 00:13:39,232
You're running because of Lana.
Why am I not surprised?

163
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:41,736
I'm running because
I think I can do a good job.

164
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:45,570
-All right, Clark, whatever.
-Pete has faith in me and so does Lana.

165
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:48,178
-It's interesting that you don't.
-What do you stand for?

166
00:13:48,347 --> 00:13:51,373
I stand for truth, justice
and other stuff.

167
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,242
You wanna be a little more specific,
tell me where you stand on the issues?

168
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,912
-What issues do you wanna talk about?
-There's the plan to cut the arts budget...

169
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:02,117
...the appalling nutritional value
of cafeteria meals, the dress code...

170
00:14:02,294 --> 00:14:05,559
...and not to mention the student
privacy issues with the locker searches.

171
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:07,722
Slow down.
I just decided to run last night.

172
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,132
Okay, well, I think the man of tomorrow
needs to get a platform for today.

173
00:14:16,642 --> 00:14:19,509
Okay, there's
a girls' volleyball game this afternoon.

174
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:22,203
You can make an appearance,
court the jock vote.

175
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:26,044
Keep Friday clear, there's a band concert.
They suck, but you've got to be seen...

176
00:14:26,218 --> 00:14:28,379
-...as a friend of the arts.
-What about my platform?

177
00:14:28,554 --> 00:14:30,954
Who cares?
If people like you, they'll vote for you.

178
00:14:31,123 --> 00:14:34,320
-What am I gonna say in my speech?
-I don't know. I don't do speeches.

179
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:37,929
See you at lunch.
We can canvass the cafeteria.

180
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:16,399
Who do they think they are?

181
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:28,710
Stop!

182
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,350
Not now. I have work to do.

183
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:07,583
Any chance you could help us
hang some posters?

184
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:10,813
Pete's convinced if he puts my name
on enough wall space, I'll win.

185
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:15,187
Besides needing to be an impartial member
of the fourth estate, I'm doing my bee story.

186
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,884
C.E.P. find anything new?

187
00:16:17,062 --> 00:16:19,792
The swarms didn't migrate
from any of their usual places.

188
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:22,525
Beekeepers all over the state
have found their hives empty.

189
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:24,931
It's like the colonies just up and left.

190
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:28,937
That's weird. Bees are followers. They
wouldn't desert their hive without reason.

191
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:33,510
My mom's addicted to Discovery Channel.

192
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,580
-So how goes the platform?
-I haven't started working on it yet.

193
00:16:36,748 --> 00:16:40,184
I've been so busy meeting people.
I even got invited to parties this weekend.

194
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:44,220
I can't believe it took one day for you to
be compromised by the lure of popularity.

195
00:16:44,523 --> 00:16:47,788
Remind me to pull your funding
after I'm elected.

196
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,485
Speaking of which,
where's the latest edition?

197
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:53,060
No, no, no!
I'm not done proofing it yet.

198
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:55,665
You shouldn't be looking at it yet.
It's not done!

199
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:59,395
Come on, I've been correcting your
comma issues since your first laptop.

200
00:17:02,474 --> 00:17:05,136
-You endorsed Paul?
-Clark, I had to be objective.

201
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,279
Paul's still in the race,
and he'll be back by fall.

202
00:17:08,447 --> 00:17:10,745
It's great that you're all gung-ho
and slogany now...

203
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,885
...but the truth is, you only ran
because Pete suckered you into it.

204
00:17:14,052 --> 00:17:17,283
Paul has a clear stance on issues
you have yet to articulate.

205
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:20,448
-It's nothing personal.
-I understand, Chloe.

206
00:17:33,138 --> 00:17:36,073
Hey, guys. Taking a break
from the campaign trail?

207
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,941
It's amazing how many people
at school I don't know.

208
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:42,012
This is a pit stop. Wanted to take
advantage of your two-for-one deal.

209
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,206
Figure that's the last step before
I institute topless waitressing.

210
00:17:45,384 --> 00:17:48,911
Well, here's to hoping it fails miserably.

211
00:17:50,322 --> 00:17:53,849
-It looks like you have customers.
-They're here because Whitney forced them.

212
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:56,494
Yeah, I passed by the Beanery.
They're kind of busy.

213
00:17:56,661 --> 00:18:01,360
The owner stopped by. He said he's made it
his mission to run this place into the ground.

214
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:05,526
Then he had the nerve to tell me
that it wasn't personal, just business.

215
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:07,934
<i>Why does everyone over 40
quote The Godfather?</i>

216
00:18:08,106 --> 00:18:11,598
I don't know, but it's really annoying.

217
00:18:11,977 --> 00:18:15,606
-So how's political life treating you?
-It's definitely a challenge.

218
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:19,581
-It shows you who your real friends are.
-How's your speech going?

219
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:23,187
-I haven't started writing it yet.
-Maybe I could help you with that.

220
00:18:23,355 --> 00:18:25,550
-Come by tomorrow. We can work on it.
-Really?

221
00:18:26,124 --> 00:18:28,752
That would be great.
You sure you have enough time?

222
00:18:29,061 --> 00:18:30,426
Look around.

223
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:35,328
Unless Whitney can coerce the baseball
team, I think I can squeeze you in.

224
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,128
Glad to see business is booming.

225
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:41,204
It's hard when even
your regular customers blow you off.

226
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:44,399
I haven't been blowing you off.
I've had my eye on the situation.

227
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:48,103
-Waiting for me to fail.
-Most new ventures don't make it.

228
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,214
Prepare yourself for that possibility.

229
00:18:50,382 --> 00:18:52,441
-I thought you didn't like to lose.
-I don't.

230
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:54,084
But it's not my fight.

231
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:57,710
-You have to know when to cut your losses.
-So, what do you suggest I do?

232
00:18:57,889 --> 00:19:01,347
The Beanery declared war. If you
wanna hold on to this place, get creative.

233
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:04,086
Be willing to get your hands dirty.

234
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:07,130
Don't worry, I'm not suggesting
anything illegal.

235
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:10,063
<i>To quote The Godfather,
"It's time to go to the mattresses."</i>

236
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:15,371
That movie should be banned
from basic cable.

237
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:22,740
Don't ask.

238
00:19:26,451 --> 00:19:28,817
All right. Bye.

239
00:19:28,987 --> 00:19:31,387
Felice, can I talk to you a minute?

240
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:33,956
You've got 55 seconds left. Go.

241
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:35,923
I've made a decision.

242
00:19:36,094 --> 00:19:38,085
You're planning on dropping out.

243
00:19:38,263 --> 00:19:41,664
No, I've decided you need to drop out.

244
00:19:42,701 --> 00:19:45,465
Trust me, that's not gonna happen.

245
00:19:45,637 --> 00:19:48,333
In case you haven't heard,
I'm the front-runner.

246
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:52,034
That's because these drones wouldn't know
a qualified candidate if they saw one.

247
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,007
That's the problem with this place.

248
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:56,713
It's like a hive with two queens.

249
00:19:56,982 --> 00:20:01,544
Well, if you knew anything about nature,
you'd realize one always goes down.

250
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,881
You know what? You're a freak.

251
00:20:06,324 --> 00:20:07,848
Okay, have it your way.

252
00:20:08,026 --> 00:20:11,518
But just remember, I did ask nicely.

253
00:20:15,634 --> 00:20:20,628
-Gabby, you're the best part of my day.
-Thank you, Mr. Luthor.

254
00:20:23,141 --> 00:20:25,439
-You're not Gabby.
-She couldn't make it.

255
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,272
Now would be a good time
for you to leave, Ms. Castle.

256
00:20:28,446 --> 00:20:30,471
Do people always do what you say?

257
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:32,014
Is that unusual?

258
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:35,415
I thought you said
you appreciated persistence.

259
00:20:35,587 --> 00:20:39,023
Besides, aren't I doing a good job?

260
00:20:39,658 --> 00:20:42,525
Lucky for you.

261
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:45,996
It took a while to figure out
what would tempt you...

262
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:48,724
...and then it hit me.

263
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:53,268
<i>It's not your picture on the Journal cover
so much as the words...</i>

264
00:20:53,438 --> 00:20:56,601
..."Son Outshines Father" in the caption.

265
00:20:56,775 --> 00:20:58,470
How am I doing?

266
00:20:58,643 --> 00:21:00,838
A little lower.

267
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:02,479
Let me guess.

268
00:21:02,647 --> 00:21:05,707
Your editor promised you
your own column if you land me.

269
00:21:05,884 --> 00:21:09,513
-You can imagine how appreciative I'd be.
-I think I can.

270
00:21:09,688 --> 00:21:12,919
Tell me, Lex, would you say
my chances are above-average...

271
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:15,116
...or below?

272
00:21:15,293 --> 00:21:19,252
Like I said, I always appreciate persistence.

273
00:21:19,431 --> 00:21:21,456
You won't regret this.

274
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:24,227
Not yet, Ms. Castle.

275
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:27,235
I paid for an hour.

276
00:22:01,206 --> 00:22:02,935
Felice Chandler, what's the problem?

277
00:22:19,157 --> 00:22:20,681
Vote for Clark.

278
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:23,327
Vote for Clark.

279
00:22:25,063 --> 00:22:28,965
I thought meeting people would be the
worst part, but it's actually kind of fun.

280
00:22:29,134 --> 00:22:33,400
I'm glad you feel that way, because
according to my latest lunchtime poll...

281
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:35,539
...you've got a shot.

282
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:37,332
Hey.

283
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,439
Hey.

284
00:22:43,615 --> 00:22:44,604
How's it going?

285
00:22:44,783 --> 00:22:47,946
Just answer "no comment."
That way she can't misquote you.

286
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:53,122
-You hear about Felice?
-Yeah, I was just at the medical center.

287
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:57,318
She was stung way worse than Paul.
She's in a coma.

288
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:00,429
Two candidates attacked in a week.

289
00:23:00,598 --> 00:23:04,193
-It's a pretty freaky coincidence.
-I think we've moved past coincidence.

290
00:23:04,469 --> 00:23:05,868
What do you think's going on?

291
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:09,734
Remember last year, Sasha's accident,
when she was stung by a hive of bees?

292
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:12,709
You think because of that,
she's controlling them?

293
00:23:17,182 --> 00:23:18,171
It's a theory.

294
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,751
Yeah, by several leaps and bounds,
but I'll look into it.

295
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,378
In the meantime, watch your back.

296
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:37,601
I just heard about Felice.

297
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:39,134
Weird, huh?

298
00:23:39,304 --> 00:23:41,397
Sometimes things just happen for a reason.

299
00:23:41,573 --> 00:23:43,837
She didn't care about this election
as much as me.

300
00:23:44,008 --> 00:23:46,909
She wasn't my favorite person,
but no one deserves that.

301
00:23:47,946 --> 00:23:50,710
Well, the good news is,
you don't have to run anymore.

302
00:23:50,882 --> 00:23:53,908
With Felice gone, the best
thing you can do is let me run things.

303
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:57,350
What about democracy?
People should have freedom of choice.

304
00:23:57,522 --> 00:23:59,922
Look, Clark, I really need this.

305
00:24:00,091 --> 00:24:02,491
My parents are riding me to win.
They think if I lose...

306
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,323
...I won't get into a good college.
You have other activities. This is my thing.

307
00:24:06,498 --> 00:24:08,989
-Why don't you just drop out?
-I'm sorry.

308
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:12,364
I have my own reasons to see this through.

309
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:14,971
You're making a mistake.

310
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,934
That sounded like a threat.

311
00:24:19,644 --> 00:24:23,273
You wouldn't know how those bees wound
up attacking Paul and Felice, would you?

312
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:25,382
Are you accusing me of something, Clark?

313
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:30,681
I find it interesting that a swarm of bees
would attack two candidates in this election.

314
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:33,881
My thoughts are somebody's behind it.

315
00:24:47,772 --> 00:24:49,069
Good start.

316
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,108
My trash bin has three drafts in it. Nothing
I can come up with sounds presidential.

317
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:55,974
You don't have to sound presidential.
Say what you believe.

318
00:24:56,147 --> 00:25:00,379
-Once you answer that, the rest is easy.
-I've still got a lot of work to do, then.

319
00:25:00,552 --> 00:25:02,452
Not as much as I have here.

320
00:25:03,721 --> 00:25:07,589
I know you're having a tough time, but it's
amazing what you've done with the place.

321
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:09,886
This was just going to be the start.

322
00:25:10,061 --> 00:25:12,461
My dream was to restore
the old theater completely.

323
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,224
The projector, the screen.
Show old movies.

324
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,766
<i>Just not The Godfather.</i>

325
00:25:19,037 --> 00:25:22,598
Come on, get back to the speech.
You have to decide what you believe in.

326
00:25:23,608 --> 00:25:26,771
I believe in my friends and their dreams.

327
00:25:27,078 --> 00:25:29,638
What if their dreams
come crashing down around them?

328
00:25:29,814 --> 00:25:33,716
Nothing's crashing down around you, Lana,
not while I'm here.

329
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,476
Thanks, Clark.

330
00:25:38,723 --> 00:25:41,248
Did you hear that?

331
00:25:42,327 --> 00:25:45,319
Yeah, it was coming from over there.

332
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:48,524
And there.

333
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,498
What is it?

334
00:25:59,644 --> 00:26:02,408
Come on! Get in!

335
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:05,306
-What about you?
-Get down!

336
00:27:02,707 --> 00:27:04,971
I still can't believe
you didn't get stung.

337
00:27:05,143 --> 00:27:07,077
Guess I have tough skin.

338
00:27:07,245 --> 00:27:09,907
The insurance forms are gonna
hurt worse than the stinger.

339
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:12,208
But I'm fine, thanks to you.

340
00:27:13,184 --> 00:27:15,015
There's Nell.

341
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:18,815
-I had a really nice time tonight.
-Yeah, we should do this more often.

342
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:24,159
-You sure you're okay?
-Sorry we didn't get further on your speech.

343
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:27,196
That's the least of my worries.
Right now, I need to find Sasha.

344
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:29,196
-Do you think she did this?
-Yes.

345
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:31,665
I just don't know how
she's controlling the bees.

346
00:27:31,836 --> 00:27:34,464
-You need to call Chloe.
-We're still not really talking.

347
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:36,732
Can you believe she didn't endorse me?

348
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:40,366
Well, if I were in her position,
I probably would have done the same thing.

349
00:27:40,545 --> 00:27:44,572
She's just being objective. She endorsed
the person she thought was most qualified.

350
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:46,239
-Yeah, but still--
-Clark...

351
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:48,578
...you said you believed in your friends.

352
00:27:48,753 --> 00:27:51,779
She only did what she thought was right.

353
00:28:19,717 --> 00:28:20,706
Chloe.

354
00:28:20,885 --> 00:28:23,183
Lana told me about the Talon.
Thanks for the call.

355
00:28:23,354 --> 00:28:25,652
-Sorry.
-It's all right, I'm not mad.

356
00:28:26,758 --> 00:28:28,055
Chloe...

357
00:28:29,994 --> 00:28:33,521
...I don't hold it against you.
The endorsement, I mean.

358
00:28:33,698 --> 00:28:35,563
Thanks. I could've warned you, though.

359
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:39,401
I just don't like being in a fight with you.

360
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,733
Yeah, it wasn't my favorite part either.

361
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:48,234
Everything has changed in my life
in the last year, with my parents...

362
00:28:48,413 --> 00:28:50,643
...with Lana.

363
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:55,352
The only thing constant has been you.
I'm glad for that, Chloe.

364
00:28:58,456 --> 00:28:59,980
Me too.

365
00:29:06,397 --> 00:29:08,456
This feels like honey.

366
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:11,466
Yeah, that's what you usually
find in a hive.

367
00:29:13,604 --> 00:29:15,435
Don't tell me Sasha did all this.

368
00:29:15,606 --> 00:29:17,801
No, her worker bees did.

369
00:29:17,975 --> 00:29:21,536
-How is she controlling them?
-I think she's emitting something called...

370
00:29:21,713 --> 00:29:24,511
...the queen mandibular pheromone.

371
00:29:24,682 --> 00:29:27,116
She pick that up
when she fell in the hive?

372
00:29:27,285 --> 00:29:29,480
She was stung over a thousand times.

373
00:29:29,654 --> 00:29:33,954
They were Africanized bees. Doctors didn't
hold out hope, because she was allergic.

374
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:36,355
How do they account
for the miracle recovery?

375
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:38,290
They don't. And neither could I...

376
00:29:38,463 --> 00:29:41,227
...until I found out
the accident happened in Shuster's Gorge.

377
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:44,800
-That's the deepest crater in town.
-Yeah. You do the meteorite math.

378
00:29:44,969 --> 00:29:47,130
The bees did something
to make her their queen.

379
00:29:47,305 --> 00:29:49,466
All the bees in the state
are taking a cue from her.

380
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,904
They're helping her make
Smallville High her hive.

381
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:55,409
If she doesn't like the way the vote goes,
it won't be a pretty sight.

382
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,980
Neither will she.
Bees are only loyal to a point.

383
00:29:58,149 --> 00:30:01,346
Once she loses control, her scent will
change, and the bees will know.

384
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:03,487
They won't be happy.

385
00:30:10,261 --> 00:30:13,355
Thought you wanted
to meet somewhere private.

386
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:16,967
Lately this has been passing for that.

387
00:30:18,503 --> 00:30:21,870
Thanks for agreeing to see me.
I just want to get a few more quotes.

388
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:24,473
How's the article going?

389
00:30:24,642 --> 00:30:26,735
People are gonna see you
in a whole new light.

390
00:30:26,911 --> 00:30:28,811
Yes, I bet they will.

391
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,245
-I've had a chance to read the rough draft.
-Where'd you get that?

392
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:36,284
I have my sources. It's hardly
the flattering expose you promised.

393
00:30:36,454 --> 00:30:39,685
-It's fair and accurate.
-You twisted everything I said.

394
00:30:39,857 --> 00:30:42,621
My journalism professor says,
"If you wanna bring down Goliath...

395
00:30:42,794 --> 00:30:45,922
...you better know his Achilles heel."
Yours is your ego.

396
00:30:47,365 --> 00:30:50,596
I see they like to mix metaphors
at East Tennessee Community College.

397
00:30:50,835 --> 00:30:53,963
Am I supposed to be scared
because you ran a background check on me?

398
00:30:54,138 --> 00:30:57,107
-I have nothing to hide.
-How much did my father pay you?

399
00:30:57,308 --> 00:31:00,368
-You really are paranoid.
-Why else would you sandbag me?

400
00:31:00,545 --> 00:31:03,446
I plan on making a name for myself
as a hard-hitting journalist...

401
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:06,777
...and you're a very visible target.

402
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,418
What's it gonna take
to make this article go away?

403
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:15,491
<i>Unlike your whore at the Inquisitor,
I'm not for sale.</i>

404
00:31:17,762 --> 00:31:20,196
Goodbye, Lex.

405
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,766
Thanks for being my first.

406
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:50,423
You wanted to see me?

407
00:31:50,595 --> 00:31:52,927
I've decided to drop out of the election.

408
00:31:53,097 --> 00:31:56,032
I thought you should be the first to know.

409
00:31:56,267 --> 00:32:00,067
Good. I'm glad you finally
made the right decision.

410
00:32:00,238 --> 00:32:04,072
The fact that those people even considered
voting for any of you guys just proves...

411
00:32:04,242 --> 00:32:07,575
...that this school needs a strong leader.
Now they'll have one.

412
00:32:07,745 --> 00:32:09,736
You'll do anything
to make sure that happens...

413
00:32:09,914 --> 00:32:13,372
...including putting your opponents
in the hospital.

414
00:32:15,586 --> 00:32:18,521
I see what this is.
You haven't dropped out at all.

415
00:32:20,591 --> 00:32:22,889
-I know you're behind the attacks.
-So?

416
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,029
What are you going to do, Clark?
Even if the police believe you...

417
00:32:26,197 --> 00:32:29,394
...they can't stop me. No one can.

418
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:32,027
Try me.

419
00:32:33,137 --> 00:32:36,300
That's what you want, isn't it?
That's why you lured me here.

420
00:32:39,243 --> 00:32:41,677
What were you gonna do, Clark?

421
00:32:51,255 --> 00:32:53,382
What are you doing?

422
00:32:53,658 --> 00:32:56,559
Teaching you that politics
is all about sacrifice.

423
00:32:58,963 --> 00:33:00,430
Where are you sending them?

424
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:04,329
You may be thick-skinned,
but what about your mother?

425
00:34:07,665 --> 00:34:10,259
-Mom, you okay?
-Yeah, thanks.

426
00:34:10,434 --> 00:34:14,029
I've never seen bees attack like that.

427
00:34:14,505 --> 00:34:17,167
Where do you think they went?

428
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,917
How'd you get here?
What about your mom?

429
00:34:31,088 --> 00:34:33,454
My mom's fine.

430
00:34:33,624 --> 00:34:34,648
It's over, Sasha.

431
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:37,191
No, it's not.
I still have a speech to make.

432
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:40,694
If you try and stop me, I'll be
in front of an auditorium full of people...

433
00:34:40,865 --> 00:34:43,493
-...and you know what I can do to them.
-You have to stop.

434
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:47,000
-No election is worth hurting people.
-I have to win, Clark.

435
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:50,800
My parents said there are two kinds of
people in the world: leaders and followers.

436
00:34:50,975 --> 00:34:53,273
And they expect for me to be a leader.
And that--

437
00:34:58,249 --> 00:35:01,150
-You have to stop the bees.
-I didn't tell them to come back.

438
00:35:03,621 --> 00:35:05,316
Ow! What's happening?

439
00:35:05,923 --> 00:35:08,414
You have to help me!
I'm allergic to bees!

440
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:11,589
Don't let them kill me!

441
00:36:11,355 --> 00:36:14,188
Let's get you to a hospital.

442
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:26,293
I can't believe Felice and Sasha
both dropped out and you still lost.

443
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,734
-Where did I go wrong?
-You ran a good campaign.

444
00:36:28,906 --> 00:36:34,811
We had fun, met some new people, and
we have enough T-shirts to last a lifetime.

445
00:36:35,146 --> 00:36:37,671
<i>-Please tell me that's not for the Torch.
-It's for Paul.</i>

446
00:36:37,848 --> 00:36:43,013
Since he couldn't attend his own victory
party, he asked me to take pictures.

447
00:36:43,187 --> 00:36:47,021
Chloe, you were right to endorse him.
He was the more qualified candidate...

448
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:49,955
...and I got caught up
in the whole popularity rush.

449
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:52,061
Don't gloat just because your guy won.

450
00:36:52,229 --> 00:36:54,789
Well, my candidate may have won,
but my friend lost.

451
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:57,627
-I'm really proud of you tonight, Clark.
-Why?

452
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:00,361
Because you're exhibiting
dignity in the face of defeat.

453
00:37:00,538 --> 00:37:04,030
It's the quality
that all great leaders possess.

454
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:12,506
-Nice crowd.
-We'll be having more nights like this.

455
00:37:12,683 --> 00:37:14,275
How can you be so sure?

456
00:37:14,451 --> 00:37:17,784
Let's just say I went to the mattresses.

457
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:21,190
<i>Check out page three
of the Ledger tomorrow.</i>

458
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:23,918
Can you give me a preview?

459
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:28,497
Apparently, a rival coffeehouse has
had several health-department violations...

460
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:31,430
-...they've been trying to cover up.
-How'd you hear about that?

461
00:37:31,702 --> 00:37:35,194
A vendor told me. So Chloe
had a reporter friend look into it.

462
00:37:35,372 --> 00:37:38,398
And sure enough, it's true.

463
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,140
Very creative. I'm impressed.

464
00:37:49,587 --> 00:37:52,750
Hey, sorry about the election.

465
00:37:52,923 --> 00:37:56,324
My father says you learn
more about yourself when you lose.

466
00:37:56,493 --> 00:38:00,361
-What did you learn?
-I'm not destined to be a politician.

467
00:38:00,831 --> 00:38:02,992
You need two different personalities.

468
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:06,762
You don't need to be an elected official
to change the world, Clark.

469
00:38:06,937 --> 00:38:10,668
-You ever thought about getting into politics?
-Someday I'd like to be president.

470
00:38:11,475 --> 00:38:14,171
In that case,
you can have your slogan back.

471
00:38:14,345 --> 00:38:16,609
It's okay, you can keep it.

472
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:26,248
Ms. Castle...

473
00:38:26,423 --> 00:38:28,357
...thank you for coming.

474
00:38:28,525 --> 00:38:32,461
I should probably know better,
but I had to hear this.

475
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:37,693
You won't mind if I record our conversation,
for both of our protection?

476
00:38:37,868 --> 00:38:39,199
Feel free.

477
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,669
I only asked you here to congratulate you.

478
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:46,004
The truth is, I'm impressed.

479
00:38:46,176 --> 00:38:49,737
Few people have caught me
with my guard down.

480
00:38:50,347 --> 00:38:53,680
Let me guess. This is where you try
and blackmail me to change my story?

481
00:38:53,851 --> 00:38:57,150
I wouldn't dream of blackmailing you
or making you change a word.

482
00:38:57,554 --> 00:39:01,217
My father says it's when they stop
talking about you that you should worry.

483
00:39:01,392 --> 00:39:03,986
-Then I guess we're settled.
-On the other hand...

484
00:39:04,161 --> 00:39:08,120
<i>...it turns out there's an opening
for managing editor at the Journal.</i>

485
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:12,393
I work there.

486
00:39:12,569 --> 00:39:17,029
-lf there was an opening, I would know.
-We don't know the same people.

487
00:39:17,207 --> 00:39:21,166
You could run your fair and balanced
article word-for-word if you'd like.

488
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:24,644
Or you could show up to work tomorrow
and walk into a corner office.

489
00:39:24,815 --> 00:39:27,613
-The choice is yours.
-What's the catch?

490
00:39:27,785 --> 00:39:30,515
No catch. Well, maybe one.

491
00:39:30,688 --> 00:39:35,022
If someone ever tries to blackmail you,
now you'll have something to hide.

492
00:39:36,493 --> 00:39:39,656
I don't know if you're better or worse
than your father.

493
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,298
What will you say when he sees
you killed the article?

494
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:45,458
-Who says he's behind it?
-Please, Ms. Castle...

495
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:49,868
...l've never insulted your intelligence,
don't insult mine.

496
00:39:51,075 --> 00:39:55,011
I'll tell him I got an offer
I couldn't refuse.

497
00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:17,858
Packing up campaign headquarters?

498
00:40:18,035 --> 00:40:19,935
Yeah, it's back to just being a barn.

499
00:40:20,104 --> 00:40:22,664
Sorry we couldn't talk more at the Talon.
It was packed.

500
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,274
It looked better that way.

501
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,502
-I'd assume that was a good thing.
-It is. It's just....

502
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:33,912
I'm not sure I liked what I did,
playing dirty with the Beanery.

503
00:40:34,084 --> 00:40:35,949
Maybe the mattress isn't for you.

504
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,180
I had to choose between doing
the right thing and being successful.

505
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:42,689
The weird part is,
I kind of enjoyed being underhanded.

506
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:47,092
Lana Lang seduced by the dark side?
Who would've thunk?

507
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:51,429
Don't worry, we all get caught up.

508
00:40:51,668 --> 00:40:56,128
I got so caught up in the popularity thing
I almost forgot why I ran.

509
00:40:58,475 --> 00:41:01,239
Did you ever finish your speech?

510
00:41:01,578 --> 00:41:04,308
Yeah. Not that anyone will ever hear it.

511
00:41:04,915 --> 00:41:07,315
-I could hear it.
-Yeah? When?

512
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:09,879
Now.

513
00:41:10,687 --> 00:41:13,019
-Right now?
-Yes, Clark.

514
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:18,288
Speech, speech, speech!

515
00:41:32,276 --> 00:41:36,144
Nobody thinks that a class president
can make a difference, but I disagree.

516
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:39,339
If we want to change the world,
first we have to change ourselves.

517
00:41:39,516 --> 00:41:42,883
My father always says that you learn
life lessons whether you win or lose...

518
00:41:43,053 --> 00:41:47,387
...so I hope that my worthy running mates
will work alongside me....

519
00:42:42,346 --> 00:42:43,335
