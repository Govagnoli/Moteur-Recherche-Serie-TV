1
00:00:21,462 --> 00:00:23,657
Hut! Hut!

2
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:46,748
Whitney, get over here!

3
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,818
Refresh my memory.
Didn't I just send a pass play in there?

4
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:52,960
The rain's coming down so hard
I couldn't see if Donner was open--

5
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:55,061
Hey! What does it say on my jacket?

6
00:00:55,363 --> 00:00:56,625
-"Coach."
-That's right.

7
00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:58,561
Football is not a democracy...

8
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:02,430
...and you will do as I say
because I know what's best for you.

9
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:06,095
Now, look, son, we have run this play
a hundred times in practice.

10
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,766
You don't have to see Donner
to know where he is, just throw it.

11
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,936
Now, I want you to go out there
and run the same play.

12
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:16,049
And I want you
to win this game for us, okay?

13
00:01:16,217 --> 00:01:17,514
Go ahead.

14
00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:20,073
All right, listen up! There is another team
eating Crow tonight, gentlemen!

15
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:25,644
I don't have to tell you how important
next Friday night's game is.

16
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,584
Not only is it gonna put us
in the state championship...

17
00:02:28,756 --> 00:02:30,815
...but it'll be Coach Walt's 200th win!

18
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:35,088
Coach Walt! Coach Walt! Coach Walt!

19
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:26,746
Come on in.

20
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:31,146
Principal Kwan,
what brings you to the sweat box?

21
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,287
We've got a problem, coach.

22
00:03:35,056 --> 00:03:40,961
-Cheating, huh? My boys?
-Seven of them, on their math midterm.

23
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:44,360
Which means they're ineligible
for next Friday's game.

24
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:47,228
Well, just keep it quiet
for a couple of weeks...

25
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:50,893
...and we'll deal with it in the off-season.

26
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:55,406
I'm not sweeping a major academic breach
under the carpet so you can win a game.

27
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:02,174
You've been here, what, six months?
I've been here 25 years.

28
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,786
We're not talking about just a game.
We're talking about my legacy.

29
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:09,480
I don't care about your legacy.
I'm here to educate young people.

30
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:11,784
I've been educating young people
all my life.

31
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,689
You know how many boys have gone
on to college because of me?

32
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:17,023
Have gotten good jobs
on my recommendations?

33
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:21,424
I know most people think
you walk on water, coach.

34
00:04:21,602 --> 00:04:23,092
I think you're dangerous.

35
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:25,796
I've seen your temper.
I've seen your methods.

36
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:27,998
Just because you win
doesn't make you right.

37
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:34,113
On Monday, I'm suspending the players.
End of story.

38
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:39,214
No!

39
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,320
-"Football: Sport or Abuse?"
-So, what do you think?

40
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:51,515
I think you need to seriously decrease
your cappuccino dependency.

41
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,819
Pete thinks I'm being too hard
on Coach Walt.

42
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:57,522
I mean, the man coached my dad,
all my brothers.

43
00:05:57,698 --> 00:05:59,825
He used to come over
and watch the Super Bowl.

44
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:01,969
While I'm touched
by that Hallmark moment...

45
00:06:02,136 --> 00:06:04,366
...you don't get points for
subtlety in journalism.

46
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:07,803
-I've started getting hate mail.
-You seem very happy about that. Why?

47
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:09,636
Because it means I'm hitting a nerve.

48
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,906
Besides, between the abysmal sentence
structure and generous use of obscenities...

49
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:17,016
...I've got a pretty good idea
of who's been sending it.

50
00:06:17,184 --> 00:06:21,245
<i>If you think my teammates read the Torch,
you're giving them way too much credit.</i>

51
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:25,959
-Don't you even care about this?
-I don't see what the big deal is.

52
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:30,223
You don't think it's a big deal?
I think it's a big deal.

53
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:37,063
There's something you don't see every day.
A pom-pom meltdown.

54
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:40,805
Here they come.
I need a picture of the cheating jockstraps.

55
00:06:40,975 --> 00:06:43,944
I don't want to hear any rumors going around,
any false accusations.

56
00:06:44,312 --> 00:06:46,143
Any idea how they got that midterm?

57
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:48,581
Still a mystery, but I'm working on it.

58
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:50,444
-We got a problem--
-What's she doing?

59
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:55,555
Nice catch.

60
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:57,588
Your teammate attempts
to assassinate me...

61
00:06:57,758 --> 00:07:01,421
-...and all you can say is "nice catch"?
-I thought you wanted to hit a nerve.

62
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,307
Hey, Kent.
I saw your arm out there.

63
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,452
Technique was lousy,
but you've got power.

64
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,417
-Thanks.
-So why aren't you on our team?

65
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:31,353
-My dad needs me on the farm.
-Your school needs you on the field.

66
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:34,050
We've got a big game Friday night.
We're short players.

67
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:36,992
Look, look.
I know your dad would understand.

68
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:39,394
-He's kind of stubborn.
-Yeah, I remember.

69
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:44,004
Jonathan Kent was one of the best athletes
I ever coached. A lot of God-given talent.

70
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:46,162
It's in your genes, Kent.

71
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:48,370
Actually, I'm adopted.

72
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:56,773
Look, I'm giving you a chance to be a part
of something special. A part of history.

73
00:07:56,951 --> 00:08:00,045
I've seen you stare at your father's
picture in that trophy case.

74
00:08:00,221 --> 00:08:02,951
Don't tell me you don't want to be
a part of this.

75
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:05,818
Now, why don't you suit up?

76
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:08,322
Look at Ross.
He doesn't have natural talent...

77
00:08:08,496 --> 00:08:12,728
-...but he's got a truckload of heart.
-Thanks, I guess.

78
00:08:14,802 --> 00:08:15,996
Let me think about it.

79
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,899
Fordman, get over here.

80
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:22,508
-Hey, Clark.
-Fordman, you're the team captain.

81
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:24,803
How do you think Kent
would do on the field?

82
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:26,947
I mean, considering our current predicament?

83
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:29,105
He might do all right.

84
00:08:29,517 --> 00:08:32,918
-He seems afraid, though.
-That's not the reason, is it, Clark?

85
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:35,213
-It's my dad--
-Kent.

86
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:39,956
There comes a time when you've got
to step out of your father's shadow...

87
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:42,459
...and be your own man.
Now, what do you say?

88
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:44,560
Are you ready to be your own man?

89
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:51,935
-Count me in.
-Good.

90
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:55,405
I will see you at practice today, 3:00.
Don't be late.

91
00:08:56,277 --> 00:08:58,609
Hey, Clark. Hey.

92
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:02,442
Remind me what your dad said
last time you asked him to play.

93
00:09:02,616 --> 00:09:06,245
-He said no.
-He said no. That's what I thought.

94
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,651
Call me when the hurting's done, okay?

95
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:15,118
-So are we okay?
-This isn't about us.

96
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:17,594
The guys made a mistake.
I don't see the big deal.

97
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,131
They cheated.
I don't know how you can support them.

98
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:23,566
Because they're my friends,
and they used to be yours.

99
00:09:23,904 --> 00:09:26,304
Do you want to tell me
what's really going on here?

100
00:09:26,474 --> 00:09:28,533
The things that I thought I knew for sure...

101
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,304
-...don't seem so certain anymore.
-I don't understand.

102
00:09:34,148 --> 00:09:37,083
I know how much you love football,
and you're great at it...

103
00:09:37,251 --> 00:09:38,775
...and I support you.

104
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:44,251
I want to find something that I'm great at.

105
00:09:55,236 --> 00:09:57,636
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, you had to say yes?

106
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,602
Coach Walt didn't give me a choice.

107
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:02,936
Let me guess. Did he give you
the "be your own man" speech?

108
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:06,805
Walt's been giving that speech
for 25 years.

109
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,006
Same one. Believe me, I know.

110
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:11,947
You've gotta go there tomorrow
and tell him you can't play.

111
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:14,212
Dad, please don't make me do that.

112
00:10:14,622 --> 00:10:16,783
I'm sorry,
we've already had this conversation.

113
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:21,519
It's never been a conversation.
I can be careful, and you don't trust me.

114
00:10:22,296 --> 00:10:26,198
-Of course I trust you, Clark, but--
-But what?

115
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:28,426
-I'm old enough to make decisions.
-On the field...

116
00:10:28,602 --> 00:10:30,593
...a million things can affect your judgment.

117
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:32,500
If you get angry for just a second...

118
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:36,336
...or you try to impress some girl
with a fancy move...

119
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,239
...somebody could get seriously hurt.

120
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:42,711
You were meant for much more important
things than winning football games.

121
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:46,314
I'm sick of being punished
because I have these gifts.

122
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:49,854
Most parents would be happy if their son
could be the star of the football team.

123
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:54,320
Son, I am happy
when you wake up in the morning.

124
00:10:55,563 --> 00:10:59,727
Now, I don't need to live vicariously
through your achievements.

125
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:03,831
Why would you? You got to play.

126
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:10,565
-I'm not signing the permission slip, Clark.
-You don't have to.

127
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:14,171
I'm playing football,
and you can't stop me.

128
00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:28,892
Well, if it isn't the three wise men.
Hello, Dominic.

129
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,555
I assume you're late
because you've been in a fencing lesson...

130
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,928
...or have you taken up polo again?

131
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:38,733
I'm not running late.
I canceled this meeting, if you recall.

132
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,875
Your father insisted
that we drive down here and keep it.

133
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:44,909
And when he barks, you jump.

134
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:49,578
-Have you seen the quarterly numbers?
-Yes, I have.

135
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,411
We're 20 percent below projections.

136
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,452
And your father wants you
to take drastic action.

137
00:11:54,622 --> 00:11:56,487
I plan to.

138
00:11:56,657 --> 00:12:01,321
Good, then I can inform him
that you'll be cutting your work force.

139
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:06,626
On the contrary. You can inform him
I plan on increasing my work force.

140
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,098
-By how much?
-Twenty percent.

141
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:13,598
Lex, I've always enjoyed
your unique sense of humor...

142
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:15,809
...but you can't be serious.

143
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:18,308
You've got to spend money
to make money.

144
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:22,415
If we increase productivity and marketing
while our competitors retreat...

145
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,683
...when the sector bounces back,
we'll corner the market.

146
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:30,688
Your father sent you to Smallville
to turn the plant around.

147
00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:34,692
He sent me to Smallville because
he'd rather surround himself with drones...

148
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:38,194
...than people who challenge
his archaic business practices.

149
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:40,833
-I'll be certain to tell him that.
-Please do.

150
00:12:41,035 --> 00:12:44,630
Now, this meeting is adjourned.

151
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,973
By the way, Dominic...

152
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:53,372
...tell your sister I said hi.

153
00:13:06,627 --> 00:13:09,721
Lana, you're home early.
Did they cancel cheerleading practice?

154
00:13:09,897 --> 00:13:12,388
Sort of. I quit.

155
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:17,635
You loved being on the squad.
What happened?

156
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:22,469
I just think there's more to life than
memorizing cheers and shaking pom-poms.

157
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,543
You just decided this out of the blue?

158
00:13:26,914 --> 00:13:29,212
Some of the football players
were caught cheating.

159
00:13:29,383 --> 00:13:32,147
Guys I know.
I told Whitney how upset it made me...

160
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:36,380
...he said it was no big deal,
that people aren't perfect.

161
00:13:37,157 --> 00:13:41,457
I thought, "Why am I doing this,
wearing a fake smile and stupid outfit...

162
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:44,256
...for people who will do anything
to win a game?"

163
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:47,889
Well, you can't let a couple of bad apples
spoil the experience.

164
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:50,536
You're part of a team,
you're making friends.

165
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:53,702
Aunt Nell, I don't want to go back.

166
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,240
I want to try different things.
What's wrong with that?

167
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,243
Nothing.
It's just that you're on a good track.

168
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:01,506
I want you to be happy.

169
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,874
What are you gonna do
with this newfound freedom?

170
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,646
I thought I'd get a job,
something part-time.

171
00:14:07,821 --> 00:14:10,688
Earn some extra money
so I can go travel in the summer.

172
00:14:12,126 --> 00:14:15,721
Well, I suppose I could always use
some help around the shop.

173
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:20,966
Thanks, but I'm not looking for help.
I want to do this on my own.

174
00:14:37,384 --> 00:14:41,718
-Have you seen Lana?
-No, but there's your dad.

175
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,383
Dad, I'm glad you're here.
It means a lot to me.

176
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:52,159
I still don't support your decision, Clark.
I'm here to see that no one gets hurt.

177
00:14:54,535 --> 00:14:56,867
Hustle it up, guys, come on.

178
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,905
-Come on, line it up.
-Kent, get in there at tailback.

179
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:05,567
Blue, 32!
Hut, hut, hut!

180
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:08,114
Kent, it's yours.

181
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,350
Yeah, Kent, it's yours.

182
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:18,118
Kent! Quit looking in the stands!
Your dad's not coaching this team, I am!

183
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,624
I didn't bring you out here
to be a tackling dummy.

184
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,989
Get angry, kick some butt!

185
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:31,766
All right, guys, same play.

186
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:33,768
Yeah, we got him.

187
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:37,274
Blue, 32! Blue, 32!

188
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:39,605
Hut, hut!

189
00:15:56,129 --> 00:16:00,566
All right, way to go, Kent!
That's what I'm talking about.

190
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:03,999
-I don't know what that was.
-Yeah, Clark! Way to go, Clark!

191
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,310
How's my favorite football fan?

192
00:16:19,486 --> 00:16:22,080
One of the players accused of cheating
came forward...

193
00:16:22,256 --> 00:16:24,383
...and said you
supplied them with the tests.

194
00:16:25,826 --> 00:16:28,522
And what boy told you
that little piece of fiction?

195
00:16:29,997 --> 00:16:31,521
I'm not at liberty to say.

196
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:34,098
I'm guessing you already went
to the school board...

197
00:16:34,268 --> 00:16:38,170
-...and asked them to suspend me.
-You have a lot of friends in high places.

198
00:16:38,338 --> 00:16:40,932
I should have. I coached most of them.

199
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:45,210
You don't understand.
I'm an institution.

200
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,609
Who'd you think the school board
was gonna believe...

201
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:50,978
...some cheating little brat
who's just trying to cover his own ass...

202
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:55,144
...or the man who's been leading
this school to victory for 25 years?

203
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:59,951
They may not believe one, but
if I can get all of them to step forward...

204
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,593
...the board will have no choice.

205
00:17:01,762 --> 00:17:04,196
They'll suspend you from coaching
for the rest of your life.

206
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:07,762
You will not bring me down!

207
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:17,101
What the hell's going on here, coach?

208
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:37,160
Who the hell does he think he is?

209
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:06,755
-Where'd your dad go?
-He kind of had to get back to the farm.

210
00:18:08,862 --> 00:18:10,625
Go get help!

211
00:18:40,627 --> 00:18:43,061
Okay, thanks, bye-bye.

212
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,165
Principal Kwan's gonna be in the hospital
till over the weekend.

213
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,426
-Is he gonna be all right?
-He's got burns...

214
00:18:48,602 --> 00:18:52,333
...and suffered smoke inhalation,
but he's gonna be okay.

215
00:18:53,106 --> 00:18:54,368
Anybody see you, son?

216
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:58,310
Nobody saw me, Dad.

217
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,477
I told the paramedics I wrapped
my hands in my jacket...

218
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:03,980
-...when I pulled him out.
-Lucky you were there.

219
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:07,217
Well, I kind of missed my ride.

220
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:13,483
Look, I saw you play, all right?

221
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,727
You could have easily hurt
any one of those boys.

222
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:19,593
But the point is, I didn't.

223
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:25,267
Why are we having this conversation?
He's never gonna believe me.

224
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:29,171
By the way,
coach gave me your old position.

225
00:19:30,844 --> 00:19:34,473
You're looking at the starting tailback
for this Friday's game.

226
00:19:40,253 --> 00:19:42,915
Don't everyone congratulate me at once.

227
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,952
-How did he get to be so stubborn?
-Gee, I don't know.

228
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,655
Wait a minute. I was not like that
when I was his age.

229
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,859
No, you were the obedient son
who always obeyed his father...

230
00:19:56,036 --> 00:19:59,938
...and didn't run away one summer
and try out for the Metropolis Sharks.

231
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,341
When did you go and join the other side?

232
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:06,912
Jonathan, Clark hasn't been able
to do anything normal his whole life.

233
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,672
No play groups, no Little League...

234
00:20:08,949 --> 00:20:11,349
...all because we were afraid
he might hurt somebody.

235
00:20:11,518 --> 00:20:13,850
He's a teenager now.
Let's give him a shot.

236
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,284
His gifts come with responsibilities.

237
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:19,050
This isn't about his gifts,
it's about his judgment.

238
00:20:19,226 --> 00:20:22,252
You're telling Clark
that you don't believe in him.

239
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,862
Of course I believe in him.

240
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:30,097
What if he makes a mistake
and somebody suspects the truth?

241
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,830
I mean, I do not want
anyone coming on this farm...

242
00:20:33,006 --> 00:20:34,871
...and taking our son away from us.

243
00:20:35,976 --> 00:20:39,207
If we don't start trusting him,
nobody will have to take him away...

244
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:41,142
...he's gonna leave all by himself.

245
00:20:44,184 --> 00:20:48,018
You guys, it doesn't make sense.
Cars don't just spontaneously combust.

246
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:51,453
-The cops said it was faulty wiring.
-I've already got my headline:

247
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,093
"Jockstrap Saves Principal
From Burning Car!"

248
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:56,195
Will you lay off the "jockstraps" thing?

249
00:20:56,363 --> 00:20:59,389
I can't believe Clark's been blinded
by the Friday-night lights.

250
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:01,830
I joined a football team, not a cult.

251
00:21:02,002 --> 00:21:04,470
Next thing you know,
I'll be joining the pom-pom brigade.

252
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:08,335
-I hear there's a spot open.
-Lana, what are you doing here?

253
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:11,136
-Taking your order, I hope.
-What--? What is this?

254
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:15,304
Some sort of a cheerleading charity, like,
be-a-waitress-for-a-night sort of thing?

255
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,849
Yes it is, except for the cheerleading
and charity parts.

256
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:21,681
And tips are always appreciated.

257
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:26,658
-So you're a waitress for real?
-Even got the perky nametag to prove it.

258
00:21:26,826 --> 00:21:29,260
-First day?
-Ever.

259
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:31,158
Where's your necklace?

260
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:34,825
Strict dress code.
No jewelry and no open-toed shoes.

261
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:37,870
You look very waitresslike.

262
00:21:38,438 --> 00:21:41,999
If I could only tell the difference between
a half-caf decaf and a nonfat latte.

263
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:46,339
-In that case, I'll have a regular coffee.
-Hey. Times three.

264
00:21:49,983 --> 00:21:51,382
Lana, you forgot this.

265
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:54,418
Thanks.
That's been happening a lot today.

266
00:21:54,588 --> 00:21:56,749
First days are always rough.

267
00:21:56,923 --> 00:21:58,686
So you just quit cheerleading?

268
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,221
You sound surprised.

269
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:03,692
Well, it's not like you broke
any state laws or anything, but I am.

270
00:22:03,863 --> 00:22:06,457
-You always seemed happy doing it.
-My mom was a cheerleader.

271
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:10,364
So was my aunt. Figured it was time
to break the vicious cycle.

272
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:13,505
What did Whitney say?

273
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:16,707
You're his teammate now.
Why don't you ask him?

274
00:22:18,612 --> 00:22:21,979
You know, it's amazing. The same day
I make the team, you quit the squad.

275
00:22:22,482 --> 00:22:24,677
I was just hoping
we'd see more of each other.

276
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:28,148
I have four shifts a week.
You can stop by anytime you like.

277
00:22:29,155 --> 00:22:32,556
Lana, table three's been waiting
for their drinks for five minutes.

278
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,694
If they go cold, it comes out of your tips.

279
00:22:34,861 --> 00:22:39,321
-Right. Sorry.
-Don't be sorry, just be faster.

280
00:22:43,837 --> 00:22:48,103
Clark Kent is a football player,
and Lana Lang is a waitress.

281
00:22:48,508 --> 00:22:50,874
-What's the matter with that?
-Nothing.

282
00:22:51,044 --> 00:22:53,740
I just want to click my heels
and get back to reality.

283
00:22:57,984 --> 00:23:01,249
Coach says he needs to see us
on the field right now.

284
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,354
What's up with your fallen brethren?

285
00:23:07,627 --> 00:23:09,254
I don't know.

286
00:23:09,896 --> 00:23:11,693
I'll see you tomorrow.

287
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:15,665
-Chloe...?
-Relax. I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

288
00:23:15,835 --> 00:23:17,302
Bye.

289
00:23:28,715 --> 00:23:31,377
Congratulations.
I've never seen a group of young men...

290
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:34,076
...demonstrate
such extraordinary stupidity.

291
00:23:34,254 --> 00:23:36,779
Now, which one of you talked?

292
00:23:37,824 --> 00:23:43,592
No one here told Kwan
that I supplied you with that test?

293
00:23:43,763 --> 00:23:47,722
Coach, no college is even gonna look at us
with cheating on our record.

294
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:53,231
So it was you, Trevor?

295
00:23:54,507 --> 00:23:57,567
Now, why doesn't that surprise me?

296
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:14,358
Nothing! Nothing is gonna stand
between me and my legacy!

297
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:19,360
Now, you go home
and keep your mouths shut, understand?

298
00:24:19,532 --> 00:24:22,296
-Yes. Sure thing, coach.
-Yes, sir.

299
00:24:38,017 --> 00:24:41,953
Congratulations, Lex,
you made the Business page for once.

300
00:24:42,122 --> 00:24:44,522
I told Dominic I was doing this
two days ago.

301
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:47,387
Yes, and my drone
dutifully reported it to me.

302
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:51,289
I just didn't think you'd be stupid enough
to implement it.

303
00:24:51,464 --> 00:24:53,523
If you had a problem,
why didn't you call me?

304
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:57,230
We have a reporting structure.
Just because you're my son...

305
00:24:57,404 --> 00:25:00,703
-...don't expect any special treatment.
-Believe me, I never have.

306
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,968
That wounded-pride routine
may have worked for your mother...

307
00:25:04,144 --> 00:25:06,635
...but don't try it with me.

308
00:25:08,915 --> 00:25:11,179
You know perfectly well
how I feel about you.

309
00:25:11,351 --> 00:25:13,251
Hence I'm at a crap factory in Smallville.

310
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,548
Lex, did you know the caesars
would send their sons...

311
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,987
...to the furthermost corners
of the empire...

312
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:22,720
...so they could get an appreciation
of how the world works?

313
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,261
Whatever helps you sleep at night, Dad.

314
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:32,866
All right, here's how I propose
we solve our impasse.

315
00:25:36,476 --> 00:25:39,843
We'll fence for it.
If you win, I'll let you pursue your plan.

316
00:25:40,013 --> 00:25:44,245
If I win,
you fire 20 percent of your work force.

317
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,113
The question you have to ask yourself,
Lex, is...

318
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,381
...are you good enough
to take your old man?

319
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,376
Look at your moves, Lex. They're rash,
no thought to their consequences.

320
00:26:11,544 --> 00:26:13,910
If I wanted a commentary,
I'd buy your books on tape.

321
00:26:15,315 --> 00:26:17,806
-You know what your problem is?
-Enlighten me.

322
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:21,886
You're ruled by your emotions.
You always have been.

323
00:26:23,723 --> 00:26:26,453
And that can be a fatal flaw.

324
00:26:30,096 --> 00:26:33,463
I want those workers gone
by noon tomorrow.

325
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,728
Meeting adjourned.

326
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,522
-Heading out to the pep rally?
-How do I look?

327
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,658
As handsome as your father.

328
00:26:59,893 --> 00:27:01,952
-You don't have to do this, Mom.
-Do what?

329
00:27:02,128 --> 00:27:03,493
Play Kent family peacekeeper.

330
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:07,690
Well, if the Kent men weren't so stubborn,
I wouldn't have to.

331
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,765
-So you're taking Dad's side?
-No, Clark, I'm not.

332
00:27:10,937 --> 00:27:13,963
-I told him he's being unreasonable.
-Thanks.

333
00:27:14,173 --> 00:27:16,471
I'm not saying you're entirely innocent
either.

334
00:27:16,643 --> 00:27:18,133
If you want to make decisions...

335
00:27:18,311 --> 00:27:21,712
...you need to be prepared
to live with your mistakes.

336
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:23,178
You trust me, don't you?

337
00:27:25,251 --> 00:27:29,711
I want to, Clark. So does your dad.

338
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:32,050
Just give him a chance.

339
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:38,797
<i>Come on, Crows, let's go
Come on, Crows, let's go, let's go</i>

340
00:27:50,677 --> 00:27:52,736
Why'd you call me? What do you want?

341
00:27:52,912 --> 00:27:55,972
I want to know if Coach Walt
supplied the players with the tests.

342
00:27:56,783 --> 00:27:58,683
If you don't want to get hurt,
leave this alone.

343
00:27:58,851 --> 00:28:00,819
Look, you can talk to me now or later.

344
00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:03,922
<i>Either way, this picture's on the front page
of tomorrow's Torch.</i>

345
00:28:10,463 --> 00:28:11,930
Just leave me alone.

346
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:30,213
Talking to the school newspaper, Trevor?
I thought you were brighter than that.

347
00:28:30,383 --> 00:28:34,319
Coach, I didn't say anything.
You've got to believe me!

348
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:37,684
She was at the field last night,
got a picture of us in the sprinklers!

349
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,755
All right.

350
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,589
Go home. I'll take care of this.

351
00:29:22,001 --> 00:29:25,266
-Hey, you seen Chloe?
-No.

352
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:33,472
Clark!

353
00:29:57,403 --> 00:29:58,495
Oh, my God!

354
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:00,633
Chloe!

355
00:30:03,543 --> 00:30:06,512
-Chloe!
-Clark!

356
00:30:21,894 --> 00:30:25,694
<i>The Torch torched.
How's that for dramatic irony?</i>

357
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:29,562
-Just trying to get you to smile.
-This is more than arson, Clark.

358
00:30:29,736 --> 00:30:31,727
It's like the fire knew what I was doing.

359
00:30:31,904 --> 00:30:34,099
You believe Coach Walt
was somehow controlling it?

360
00:30:34,273 --> 00:30:35,535
Look at the facts.

361
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,404
Kwan launches an investigation
into the cheating scandal.

362
00:30:38,578 --> 00:30:40,102
Coach tries to fry him in his car.

363
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:44,215
One of his players comes forward, and he
threatens them with pyrotechnic sprinklers.

364
00:30:44,383 --> 00:30:47,011
<i>I'm about to print the picture,
and the Torch goes up in flames.</i>

365
00:30:47,186 --> 00:30:50,587
You think he's behind the cheating scandal?
Come on, Chloe.

366
00:30:50,757 --> 00:30:52,952
Coach obsessed with winning
his 200th game...

367
00:30:53,126 --> 00:30:55,890
...helps bonehead players pass test
to secure his position...

368
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,292
...in the pantheon of high-school sports.

369
00:30:59,766 --> 00:31:03,668
-Do you have another copy of the picture?
-No, it's kind of hard to recover the files.

370
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:06,361
-We don't have any proof.
-Trevor Chapell.

371
00:31:06,672 --> 00:31:08,503
What about him?

372
00:31:08,674 --> 00:31:11,541
I'm sure he talked to Kwan
about the cheating.

373
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,804
He wants to talk, I know it,
but he's still scared to talk to me...

374
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:17,449
...but I think he might open up to you.

375
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,788
Lana! What happened?
Did Nell put you out on the street?

376
00:31:31,998 --> 00:31:34,865
-I decided to join the work force.
-Good for you.

377
00:31:35,034 --> 00:31:37,161
You'll be employee of the month
in no time.

378
00:31:37,336 --> 00:31:40,897
Right now I hold the record
for most dishes broken in a single day.

379
00:31:41,674 --> 00:31:45,166
Better bring my cappuccino
in a Styrofoam cup, then.

380
00:31:48,347 --> 00:31:50,941
Well, if it isn't Smallville's
latest football star.

381
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:54,142
Let's see how I do tomorrow night.
Have you seen Trevor tonight?

382
00:31:54,387 --> 00:31:57,151
-No, he hasn't been in.
-How are things going here?

383
00:31:57,323 --> 00:32:00,349
Today is one of those days
I just want to scream.

384
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,558
Well, for what it's worth,
I think it's cool you got this job.

385
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:07,926
For what it's worth, I'm sorry I'm
not gonna get to see you play tomorrow.

386
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,590
New girl gets the worst shifts.

387
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,696
-Can I get you anything?
-May I have a cup of coffee?

388
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,338
-Coming right up.
-Thanks.

389
00:32:16,676 --> 00:32:19,270
Rumor has it Clark Kent
joined the football team.

390
00:32:19,545 --> 00:32:23,447
-Rumor's true.
-Congratulations. Your dad must be thrilled.

391
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:26,107
Actually, he freaked out
and told me I couldn't play.

392
00:32:26,552 --> 00:32:29,817
I'm surprised with my dad. He claims
I should make my own decisions...

393
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,514
...but then when I do, he shuts me down.

394
00:32:32,692 --> 00:32:35,627
And you're out late, waiting for him
to go to bed so you can avoid...

395
00:32:35,795 --> 00:32:38,195
...the uncomfortable silence
when you get home.

396
00:32:38,364 --> 00:32:40,264
-How'd you know?
-The Luthors wrote the book...

397
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:42,628
...on uncomfortable silences.

398
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,972
What are you working on?

399
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,970
I'm trying to figure out
which poor bastards should get the ax.

400
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:52,610
My father wants me to cut
20% of my work force.

401
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:55,639
-Any way around it?
-Once my father's made his mind up...

402
00:32:55,815 --> 00:32:59,546
-...he's not easy to turn around.
-lf it makes you guys feel any better...

403
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:02,313
...you should have seen my aunt's face
when I took this job.

404
00:33:03,055 --> 00:33:05,785
Not that I was eavesdropping or anything.

405
00:33:06,392 --> 00:33:09,384
-I guess we're all in the same boat.
-No. You both stood your ground...

406
00:33:09,562 --> 00:33:11,621
...and are doing what you want.
I caved.

407
00:33:13,766 --> 00:33:15,165
You two have inspired me.

408
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:19,568
Oh, yeah, joining the football team
and pouring some coffee.

409
00:33:19,739 --> 00:33:23,106
-We're a couple of real rebels.
-Long live the revolution.

410
00:33:26,512 --> 00:33:27,911
How is it?

411
00:33:29,248 --> 00:33:31,239
It's perfect.

412
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:37,152
-Is that what you ordered?
-Not even close.

413
00:33:43,996 --> 00:33:48,899
Trevor, it's Clark Kent.
I'm here to talk.

414
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,798
Just leave or he'll come back.

415
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,929
Coach Walt?

416
00:33:55,141 --> 00:33:58,838
-Once he gets angry--
-What did he do to you?

417
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:06,612
Coach rides me pretty hard, you know,
me and some of the others.

418
00:34:06,786 --> 00:34:11,382
Thinks he's our father or something.
That's how he justifies it, anyway.

419
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:14,988
Once when I dropped a pass,
he drove me home, punched me in the gut...

420
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:17,959
-...told me not to do it again.
-Why didn't you tell anyone?

421
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:21,793
Coach said he'd throw me off the team,
wouldn't help me pass my classes.

422
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:25,165
Did he give you that math midterm?

423
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,542
-Trevor, I can help.
-That's what Principal Kwan said.

424
00:34:31,711 --> 00:34:33,372
Look what coach did to him.

425
00:34:35,748 --> 00:34:39,149
-What happened to your arm?
-It's nothing. It's a carburetor burn.

426
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:42,009
It's nothing.

427
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:43,686
Let me see it, Trevor.

428
00:35:03,376 --> 00:35:06,436
I don't know how coach did it,
but if I talk, he's gonna fry me.

429
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:17,247
Kent, why aren't you in the locker room
suiting up?

430
00:35:17,423 --> 00:35:20,392
I'm not walking out on that field,
and neither are you.

431
00:35:21,627 --> 00:35:23,891
Look, I don't know what the hell
your problem is...

432
00:35:24,063 --> 00:35:27,464
...but you do not want
to tick me off right now.

433
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:42,745
-I saw what you did to Trevor's arm.
-Trevor should have kept his mouth shut!

434
00:35:44,116 --> 00:35:47,449
What's the matter, Kent?
A little too hot for you, huh?

435
00:35:55,294 --> 00:35:59,060
Well, excuse me now.
I've got a game to win.

436
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,619
Blue, 32! Hike!

437
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,471
-Chloe.
-Hi, Mrs. Kent. Hi, Mr. Kent.

438
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:47,074
Smallville's resident cynic
have a change of heart?

439
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:50,746
Well, I decided to put my personal politics
aside to support my friends.

440
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:53,111
Yes, we're trying the same philosophy.

441
00:36:53,285 --> 00:36:54,718
-Where's Clark?
-I don't know.

442
00:36:54,887 --> 00:36:57,913
I was supposed to meet him, but he didn't
show. I thought he was with you.

443
00:37:22,815 --> 00:37:25,443
-Hey, Pete. Pete.
-Hey.

444
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,382
-Have you seen Clark?
-No, haven't seen him all day.

445
00:37:28,554 --> 00:37:31,148
Jonathan, you know the rules,
no parents on the sidelines.

446
00:37:31,323 --> 00:37:34,190
-I'm looking for Clark.
-Well, join the club. I need him out here.

447
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,386
Guess he doesn't have what it takes
to be a winner, huh?

448
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:46,193
-Nobody's seen him.
-I think the coach is lying.

449
00:37:46,372 --> 00:37:49,808
What's going on here, Chloe?

450
00:37:49,975 --> 00:37:52,535
All right, I'll check the locker room.
You check the school.

451
00:37:52,845 --> 00:37:53,971
I'll be back in five.

452
00:37:54,213 --> 00:37:58,013
-We're in the middle of a game here.
-Just call the damn plays!

453
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:18,766
Clark!

454
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:21,766
Clark!

455
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:33,249
Clark! Clark! Clark!

456
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,847
Come on!

457
00:38:39,325 --> 00:38:42,123
-Can you hear me? Are you all right?
-It's the meteor rocks.

458
00:38:42,428 --> 00:38:46,023
Come on. Come on.

459
00:39:05,618 --> 00:39:09,486
-Coach, you need help.
-What I need is to win this game.

460
00:39:09,655 --> 00:39:11,623
It's too late for that.

461
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,167
How'd you do that?

462
00:39:32,011 --> 00:39:34,002
It's in the genes.

463
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,745
Give it up, coach. You've lost.

464
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:03,867
Two trips in one week. I'm flattered, Dad.

465
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,240
-What is this?
-It's my new proposal.

466
00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:11,474
I cut the operating budget by 20%
without losing a single job.

467
00:40:11,717 --> 00:40:14,845
Lex, I specifically told you
to cut your work force.

468
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,420
Why? With this plan,
you don't get the bad PR.

469
00:40:18,857 --> 00:40:21,052
That's not the point.

470
00:40:21,927 --> 00:40:24,896
Careful, Dad, you're getting emotional.

471
00:40:26,832 --> 00:40:28,959
We could always try a rematch.

472
00:40:29,134 --> 00:40:31,068
Are you afraid you can't take
your son again?

473
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,330
-You get one.
-One what?

474
00:40:35,507 --> 00:40:37,031
One chance to defy me.

475
00:40:39,912 --> 00:40:42,346
I can't figure out what you hate more...

476
00:40:42,514 --> 00:40:45,779
...the fact that my plan works
or that you didn't come up with it first.

477
00:40:46,251 --> 00:40:49,345
Just remember:
Empires aren't built on clever bookkeeping.

478
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:53,115
Dad, you have no idea
what I'm capable of.

479
00:40:58,897 --> 00:41:01,297
Sorry you didn't get to play.

480
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,162
Were you here to make sure
I didn't hurt anyone?

481
00:41:04,603 --> 00:41:07,868
I was here to support my son.

482
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:15,177
Some of the things I said were out of line.

483
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:19,547
Look, I do trust you, Clark, I do.

484
00:41:19,718 --> 00:41:23,779
I guess there's always gonna be
a part of me that's a little bit afraid...

485
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,184
...but that's just being a parent.

486
00:41:29,027 --> 00:41:30,255
Thanks, Dad.

487
00:41:40,105 --> 00:41:42,164
Peaceful, isn't it?

488
00:41:42,608 --> 00:41:47,978
-Hey, thought you were working.
-I got let go.

489
00:41:48,147 --> 00:41:52,948
-Apparently, I'm not waitress material.
-Sorry.

490
00:41:53,352 --> 00:41:55,013
How'd your aunt take it?

491
00:41:55,187 --> 00:42:00,386
She said that it was a sign that I should
seriously reconsider cheerleading.

492
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,788
Parents, what are you gonna do?

493
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,498
I heard about the coach. Pretty weird.

494
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:11,727
He won his 200th game
and didn't even see it.

495
00:42:12,137 --> 00:42:14,332
Are you gonna play next season?

496
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,398
I don't know if football's for me.

497
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:21,103
I mean, my dad played,
my granddad played.

498
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,113
I think it's time to break the vicious cycle.

499
00:42:24,516 --> 00:42:27,349
Pretty short career.
Why the change of heart?

500
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:28,747
I don't know.

501
00:42:28,954 --> 00:42:32,583
Guess I got out on the field and realized
my reason for playing was gone.

502
00:42:35,694 --> 00:42:37,093
I'm sorry to hear that.

503
00:42:42,134 --> 00:42:43,362
Who said life was fair?

504
00:42:45,304 --> 00:42:46,601
Gonna be okay?

505
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,701
Sometimes I just want to scream.

506
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:55,345
-Why don't we?
-Why don't we what?

507
00:42:55,514 --> 00:43:00,679
-Scream. I'm game if you are.
-You serious?

508
00:43:00,986 --> 00:43:02,851
Why not?

509
00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:06,080
On three.

510
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:10,690
One...two...three.

511
00:44:03,649 --> 00:44:04,638
