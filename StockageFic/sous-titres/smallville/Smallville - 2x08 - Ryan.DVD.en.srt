1
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,402
All right, Ryan, what am I looking at?

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:10,999
Ryan.

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,706
A dog.

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,614
What kind of dog?

5
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,944
- A lab.
- What color is it?

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,448
- What color?
- Brown.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,549
A tree.

8
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,855
A pine tree.

9
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:42,806
Ryan.

10
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,171
A father, mother and son.

11
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,387
Another pressure headache?

12
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:56,883
Let's try and push on.

13
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:00,954
- I don't want to answer any more questions.
- There's just a few more left.

14
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,520
Full moon.

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,663
A butterfly.

16
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,092
Train.

17
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,901
You're afraid you're not gonna get
all your research done.

18
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,467
Get some coagulant.

19
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,766
Yes, doctor.

20
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,203
What is it, Ryan?

21
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,315
What's OxyContin?

22
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,017
It's a very powerful narcotic. Why?

23
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,192
He's stealing it.

24
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,485
I knew it.

25
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,027
I'll be right back.

26
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,443
- What do you got there?
- The coagulant.

27
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,844
It's what you asked for, right?

28
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,747
Son of a... Son of a bitch!

29
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,750
Ryan.

30
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,887
Ryan?

31
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,456
Ryan, open the door.

32
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,256
Open the door now. Open up.

33
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,862
Clark, can you get that?

34
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,171
Yeah.

35
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,109
- Hello?
- Clark, you gotta help me.

36
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,802
Ryan, is that you?

37
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,581
- You gotta get me out.
- Calm down. Where are you?

38
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:40,048
A hospital called Summerholt.
Clark, you gotta get me out, please!

39
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,744
Get in there.

40
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,253
- Give me the phone.
- They're experimenting on me!

41
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,224
- What?
- Let go, help! Clark! No!

42
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,655
Calm down, Ryan.

43
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,388
- Let go, let go! Let go!
- Lay him down.

44
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,054
Ryan!

45
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:58,401
I'll stop! Don't put that in me! Stop!
Let go! No! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

46
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,172
I'm sorry!

47
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:12,642
Ryan's aunt's phone has been disconnected.
The operator said there's no new listing.

48
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,372
- It's like she disappeared.
- Doesn't make any sense.

49
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,709
- What about this Summerholt?
- No, I checked.

50
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,517
There's no hospital by that name
in Edge City.

51
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,211
When did you last hear from Ryan?

52
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,414
He sent an e-mail a few weeks ago.
He was getting ready for school.

53
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,952
I'm calling the Edge City police.

54
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,788
I've never heard him so scared.

55
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:34,331
Maybe somebody's filed
a missing persons report.

56
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,837
I keep thinking I missed something.

57
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,775
Some clue in his e-mail,
some sign that things weren't okay.

58
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,846
I guess I just wasn't listening.

59
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:53,349
I know Ryan means a lot to you, Clark,
but you've gotta cut yourself some slack.

60
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,349
Second-guessing isn't gonna help.

61
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:59,422
Hey, remember that cute guy Henrik,
who works at the phone company?

62
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:03,323
Yeah, you mean the Hungarian one
with the toy scooter?

63
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:07,330
He's Austrian, and it's a classic Vespa,
but anyway...

64
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,934
...he traced Ryan's call
back to its point of origin.

65
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,434
You found something.

66
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,567
Summerholt Neurological Institute.

67
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,608
- It's not in Edge City, it's in Metropolis.
- That explains why we couldn't find it.

68
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:22,043
The weird thing is that Summerholt is
a research facility. They don't take patients.

69
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,513
And if they did, why would
Ryan be in lockdown...

70
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,812
...in a place that specializes
in super-esoteric brain research?

71
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,753
Mr. Mayor. Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

72
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,559
Always a pleasure, Lex.
How can I help you?

73
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,670
As you know, LexCorp is in the midst
of major plan expansion.

74
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:49,202
But we're still awaiting final approval
from the zoning commission.

75
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,304
Well, you know how it is these days, Lex.

76
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,538
With all these environmental
and safety regulations.

77
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,874
There's no such thing
as a rubber stamp anymore.

78
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:03,381
If this project collapses,
it's gonna cost Smallville a lot of jobs.

79
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,486
I've been friends with your father...

80
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:10,117
...ever since LuthorCorp bought
the old creamed-corn plant.

81
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,561
He was always a very generous supporter.

82
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,964
I never realized my father had an interest
in local politics.

83
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:22,202
I don't think he does. But I know he's never
had a permit held up at the commission.

84
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,046
You want a bribe?

85
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,372
I never said that.

86
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,775
But now that you're running
your father's plant...

87
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,114
...you should learn
how business gets done.

88
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,280
Let's be clear.

89
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:43,494
I don't work for my father anymore,
and it's not his plant. LexCorp owns it.

90
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,722
And I have my own way of doing business.

91
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,163
I'm up for re-election soon.
It's my fourth term.

92
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:55,034
Think of this as the beginning of
a long-term relationship, which could have...

93
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,507
...beneficial consequences for both of us.

94
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,037
Call this man.

95
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,876
He'll explain how things work.

96
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:13,415
Oh, and imagine how much you'll lose
if construction shuts down.

97
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,058
Hey.

98
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,103
Hi. How was your ride?

99
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,640
Oh, it was great. We took the long way
around Crater Lake.

100
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,938
Do you remember riding at
the Metropolis Equestrian Center?

101
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:37,082
And you said you wished you
belonged to a club like that?

102
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,117
Yeah. They've got fantastic facilities.

103
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:45,089
Well, what would you say if I told you
you could ride there every weekend...

104
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,283
...and any time you wanted after school?

105
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,826
I'd say it'd be a long drive.

106
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,426
I know this is sudden.

107
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,191
But...

108
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:59,670
Well, Dean's taking a job in Metropolis,
and he wants us to move with him.

109
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,807
And you said yes?

110
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,209
I know it's a lot to ask, Lana.

111
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,813
But it's important to Dean...

112
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:13,111
...and I think it'll be a great opportunity
for you. It'll be great for all of us.

113
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,712
I can't believe you agreed to do this
without even asking me.

114
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:23,320
- I know it's difficult to imagine right now...
- What about school? And my friends?

115
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,623
Not to mention the Talon.

116
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,323
Lana, you can visit Smallville
any time you want.

117
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:44,280
This Summerholt Institute has
more bureaucracy than the IRS.

118
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,385
I was on hold for an hour before
they told me to call tomorrow.

119
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,445
I want to go and check it out.

120
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,557
The police have been there,
and there was no sign of Ryan.

121
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:56,555
- This might not even be the place.
- Ryan's like a little brother to me.

122
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,254
If something happened to him,
I'd never forgive myself.

123
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,899
We understand how you feel.

124
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:04,696
But you can't just go and start
ripping the doors off this place.

125
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,811
His name is Ryan James.

126
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,388
I told you, we have no one here
by that name.

127
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,721
- I know he's here.
- Lf you don't leave, I'll call security.

128
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,794
I want to talk to someone in charge.

129
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,022
- Mary, is there a problem?
- Dr. Garner.

130
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,793
This man believes we have
a friend of his here.

131
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,869
It's okay, I'll handle it. Dr. Garner.

132
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,260
Clark Kent.

133
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,465
- Kent. Did your parents call earlier?
- Yeah.

134
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:47,908
We're looking for our friend Ryan James.
He called and said he was being held here.

135
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,640
There's been a mistake.
We're a research facility.

136
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,613
I know he's here.

137
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,210
Don't take my word for it,
talk to the police.

138
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,323
They came by and checked. Twice.

139
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:02,021
I wish I could help you,
but your friend isn't here.

140
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,728
I hope you find him.

141
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,642
- Ryan.
- Clark?

142
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,750
Hey. You're not supposed to be in here.

143
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,701
It's okay, we'll get you out of here.

144
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,330
- Here you go.
- I knew you'd come for me.

145
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,284
Here you go, Ryan.

146
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,415
How you doing?

147
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,218
Okay. Thanks to Clark.

148
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,658
Ryan, do you have any idea how we can
get ahold of your aunt?

149
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:13,991
I think she moved to Arizona.

150
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,566
How could she just leave you?

151
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,838
A few months ago, I started getting
nosebleeds and headaches.

152
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,539
She took me to doctors,
but no one knew what the problem was.

153
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,907
The bills were becoming too much
for her to handle...

154
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:31,411
Then Dr. Garner showed up
and offered to pay for my care.

155
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,710
Ryan, what were they treating you for?

156
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,121
They were...

157
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,817
- They were treating me...
- They were holding him for observation.

158
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,126
Clark, can I talk to you for a moment?

159
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,760
Clark?

160
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,869
Yeah?

161
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,944
Never mind.

162
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,846
Get some rest, okay?

163
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,523
I appreciate you taking Ryan in.

164
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,186
If I took him home,
my parents would have freaked.

165
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,129
Yeah, kidnapping has that effect on people.

166
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,896
Why did you break him out if they
were only keeping him for observation?

167
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,130
Look, I didn't have a choice.

168
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:32,767
- They were treating him like a lab rat.
- Clark, you abducted a minor.

169
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:36,312
They'll trace him to you and me.
We're in serious trouble here.

170
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:42,283
I shouldn't have involved you.
I'll find someplace else to hide him.

171
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,289
Ryan's staying here.
At least for tonight.

172
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:49,393
Tomorrow I'll talk to my lawyers,
see what our options are.

173
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,252
I'm sorry.

174
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,922
I didn't think it through. I saw him
hooked to wires, I had to do something.

175
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,728
So you staged a one-man prison break?

176
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:03,036
How did you manage to get him out
without anybody stopping you?

177
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,711
Just lucky, I guess.

178
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,348
You're the luckiest guy I've ever met.

179
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,782
Let's hope it doesn't run out
before tomorrow.

180
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,887
Mom?

181
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,761
Hey, Dad.

182
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,338
What's going on?

183
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,337
Where's Ryan?

184
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,676
- He's safe from you.
- Clark, what did you do?

185
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,105
Sheriff, search every inch of this farm.

186
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,641
Wait, you can't do that.

187
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,614
- They have a search warrant.
- Place him under arrest for kidnapping.

188
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,279
What?

189
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,854
Look. Give me till tomorrow morning.

190
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:01,932
I don't know how you got him out of
Summerholt, but if he's not here by 9 a. M...

191
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:07,368
...federal marshals will be crawling all over,
and your life is going under the microscope.

192
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,012
Ryan. Hi.

193
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,348
Hi, Ryan.

194
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,818
Mr. Kent.

195
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,123
Please don't be mad at Clark,
he was trying to help me.

196
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,730
I know that, Ryan.

197
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,135
You should've seen the way
he threw that orderly.

198
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:46,404
- He must have weighed, like, 300 pounds.
- No, he's exaggerating. A little.

199
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:51,148
Look, Ryan, we're glad
that you're okay, but...

200
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,812
...Clark did go about this the wrong way.
I'm afraid that we don't have...

201
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,786
...much of a choice but to give you back.

202
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,594
How did you end up in Summerholt?

203
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,996
Dr. Garner told my aunt that there was
something wrong with my brain.

204
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,961
That's why I can read minds.

205
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,569
She found out about my ability,
it just freaked her out.

206
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,672
Ryan, I'm so sorry.

207
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:22,837
She's not a bad person, she just couldn't
accept that I was different.

208
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,921
They're here.

209
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,327
Hello, Ryan.

210
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,534
Please don't let him take me.

211
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:50,608
Dr. Garner's agreed to drop the kidnapping
charges if you turn over the boy.

212
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,336
Come on, Ryan, we need to get back
to Metropolis.

213
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,946
I'm Ryan's legal guardian,
and I have the paperwork denoting such...

214
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,211
...please do your job.

215
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:06,620
Having custody of a child is not the same
thing as having a pink slip to a car.

216
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,784
Can't you see he doesn't want
to go with you?

217
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,719
Ethan, please.

218
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,996
The choice is yours, Mr. And Mrs. Kent.

219
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,830
You can lose one boy here today,
or both of them.

220
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,968
I believe kidnapping comes
with some juvenile time.

221
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,372
I'm sorry, folks, but...

222
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,610
Sheriff.

223
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,319
Before you do anything...

224
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,686
...take a look at this.

225
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:46,188
It's a restraining order giving the Kents
custody until the situation can be reviewed.

226
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:50,529
You want to try a judicial roadblock?
You go ahead. I'll have Clark arrested.

227
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,731
You could, but I have a countersuit
ready to be filed.

228
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,365
Metropolis DA is very interested in
Summerholt's research practices...

229
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,439
...especially involving minors
held under duress.

230
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,844
Your move, doctor.

231
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,918
This isn't over.

232
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,587
Your rich friend saved you today, Clark.

233
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,628
Sheriff.

234
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,409
Surprise!

235
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,639
It's your jailbreak party.

236
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,876
We even have the obligatory
pistachio log ice cream cake...

237
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,988
...and we managed to rustle up a band.

238
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,124
This is so cool. Thanks, guys.

239
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,759
Good to see you, man.

240
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,161
I'm so glad you're back.

241
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,801
Yeah, me too.

242
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,264
You knew about this
the whole time, didn't you?

243
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,803
- Half a block away.
- Yeah.

244
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:11,944
- Thanks for not ruining the surprise.
- I was tempted to. I hate pistachio.

245
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,253
But it was definitely worth the kiss.

246
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,846
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Pete. Tell your mom thanks.

247
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:46,877
- Thanks for what?
- She cosigned the restraining order.

248
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:50,283
Imagine getting a call from Lex Luthor
at 5 in the morning?

249
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,149
Hey, Pete. Come here a second.

250
00:19:56,962 --> 00:20:00,728
- Pete knows your secret.
- Yeah, I know, I told him. It's all right.

251
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,292
- Did you know he's stressed out about it?
- No.

252
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,767
- Why?
- He's worried one day he'll slip up and tell.

253
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,635
Then they'll lock you up
in a place like Summerholt.

254
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:16,907
Brought you guys a couple of pieces
before everyone eats it all.

255
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,254
Hey, what's wrong?

256
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:29,056
- Just a headache.
- I'll go get you a glass of water.

257
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,919
You sure you're okay?

258
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,765
Clark.

259
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,600
Lana's moving to Metropolis.

260
00:20:56,388 --> 00:21:00,017
Hey, Clark, got your message.
Is everything okay?

261
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,214
Yeah.

262
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,161
I just wanted to thank you for the party.
It was really great.

263
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,762
Sorry we left early,
Ryan wasn't feeling so good.

264
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,924
Yeah, how's he doing?
He didn't look so hot.

265
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,332
To be honest, I'm not really sure.

266
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:16,998
He's got a doctor's appointment tomorrow
to try to figure out what they did to him.

267
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,675
You should have seen him, Lana.

268
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,609
But he's safe now, thanks to you.

269
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,846
Yeah, he's just such a good kid.

270
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,680
Seems like life's always
kicking him in the teeth.

271
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,152
Makes you realize how lucky we are.

272
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:41,626
- You okay? You seem a little preoccupied.
- Oh, no. No, I'm fine.

273
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,459
Things aren't as solid between us
as they used to be...

274
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:49,767
...but I'm still here for you
if you want to talk about anything.

275
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:58,148
Nell and Dean are moving to Metropolis,
and I'm supposed to go with them.

276
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,319
How do you feel about that?

277
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,986
How would you feel if you were uprooted
and sent somewhere far away...

278
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,354
...where you didn't know anyone?

279
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,653
I think it'd be really tough.

280
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:17,059
I feel like a piece of luggage
they want to throw in the trunk...

281
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,965
...as they drive off to their new life.

282
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,106
Have you talked to Henry Small
about this?

283
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,608
No, I'm not ready to dump this in his lap.

284
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:30,270
Just because we might share the same DNA
does not mean we're family.

285
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:37,017
Well, you can come stay with us.
It's just kind of crowded right now.

286
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,851
Ryan's lucky.

287
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,559
At least he got to choose his family.

288
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,364
I'll see you later.

289
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,239
Don't go.

290
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,178
Don't go to Metropolis.

291
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,942
Or what? You gonna kidnap me too?

292
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:10,144
Nell shouldn't be able to dictate your life
without your input.

293
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,120
If moving doesn't feel right, don't go.

294
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,028
Mr. Luthor's in Metropolis
so I won't be long...

295
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,470
...and then we'll get you to the doctor.

296
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:34,976
You pretend around Mr. Kent
you don't like your job. But you do.

297
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:40,778
Now that you're in our lives, I may
give it up to spend more time with you.

298
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,418
- I don't want to be a problem.
- Ryan.

299
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,855
You are a gift. Like Clark.

300
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,091
I know your secret.

301
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,428
Why don't you tell Mr. Kent and Clark?
They'd want to know.

302
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,798
I will, when the time is right,
but in the meantime...

303
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,235
- I promise, my lips are sealed.
- Thank you.

304
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,567
Ryan.

305
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:06,506
- Hi, Lex.
- Hey, how you feeling?

306
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:10,876
- Much better. Thanks again for...
- Harboring you? My pleasure.

307
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,018
- I'd better get to work.
- See you.

308
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,711
So can I check out that
Warrior Angel collection?

309
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,819
That depends. Your hands clean?

310
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:29,762
Warrior Angel, number one, mint condition.

311
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,930
I had two copies of every issue.
One for the collection...

312
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,231
And one for reading.

313
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,939
Why do you like Warrior Angel so much?

314
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,976
Helped me through some tough times
when I was younger.

315
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,239
After your mom died?

316
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,574
How did you know that?

317
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,817
Clark told me.

318
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:59,023
The world between these glossy covers
was reassuring.

319
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:02,564
You knew who the heroes and villains were.
When you grow up...

320
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,031
...you learn that not everything's
black and white.

321
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,637
So now all you see is shades of gray?

322
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,468
Ryan.

323
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,667
Real life is not a comic book.

324
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:16,471
Sometimes you have to get
your hands dirty, make compromises.

325
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:20,781
That's what your father told you.
That doesn't mean he's right.

326
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:26,018
You are either remarkably intuitive or...

327
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,795
Ryan?

328
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,800
Ryan, what's wrong?

329
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,505
It's so loud.

330
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,668
Hey, buddy, how's your head?

331
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,436
Still hurts a little.

332
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,077
- The newest issue.
- Yeah, they had it at the gift shop.

333
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:32,752
- So, what's up with the floating balloon?
- It's Warrior Angel's aerodrome.

334
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,189
A floating fortress where he can get away
from his troubles.

335
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,329
Sounds like something
everyone should have.

336
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:41,090
- Not sure about the floating part though.
- Why not?

337
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,899
I have this little fear of flying.

338
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:51,675
- I didn't think you were scared of anything.
- There's a lot of things I'm scared of.

339
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,640
Guess I just put on a brave face.

340
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,642
Yeah.

341
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,581
Me too.

342
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,553
My parents said the doctors
are gonna run more tests.

343
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:09,283
They don't need to, I know what's wrong
with me. I read Dr. Garner's mind.

344
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:11,385
What is it?

345
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,233
There's a tumor in my head, Clark.

346
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,432
- It's getting bigger.
- I'll tell the doctors.

347
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,162
They know.

348
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,083
I'm dying, Clark.

349
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,116
And no one can save me.

350
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,474
Clark.

351
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:12,287
- We're going to the hospital, wanna come?
- Is there any news?

352
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:20,787
Son, the tumor is growing
at an accelerated rate.

353
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:25,231
The doctors think it's probably due
to the experiments that were done on Ryan.

354
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,610
This is Ryan's.

355
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,245
He thinks I'm a hero.

356
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:41,014
- Hey, you've helped a whole lot of people.
- I can't help Ryan.

357
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:44,485
- What kind of hero is that?
- Listen...

358
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:48,750
...this thing is beyond
even your ability, son.

359
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:52,419
The doctors are doing everything
that they can. We...

360
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,588
...have to pray for the best.

361
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,929
What am I supposed to do,
just sit here and watch Ryan die?

362
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:01,072
- No. Nobody's asking you to do that, Clark.
- Good.

363
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,769
Because I'm not gonna give up.

364
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:18,346
"Facts on child emancipation." I have
a feeling this isn't for a research paper.

365
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:22,459
I decided to tell Nell that I wasn't
moving with her to Metropolis.

366
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:25,425
Well, that's very Erin Brockovich of you.

367
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,928
How did Nell take it?

368
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:32,468
One, she's my legal guardian,
two, I'm a teenager, and three:

369
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:37,501
- I don't have any say in the matter.
- That pretty much covers all your bases.

370
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,666
Are you gonna pursue
the emancipation thing?

371
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:43,177
It could take up to a year and a half
to complete the process.

372
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:46,647
- Sounds like you're talking yourself out of it.
- It's my last shot.

373
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:53,145
You know, you might have
one other option.

374
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,955
This is the man you want to talk to.

375
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:04,500
He's developed a radical new serum
that shrinks primary brain tumors.

376
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:07,431
- It's experimental.
- How can I get in touch with him?

377
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:08,594
That's the problem.

378
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,004
His office in Hub City said he's flying
to Helsinki this afternoon...

379
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,769
...he won't be back for six weeks.

380
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:16,713
By that time, it'll be too late.

381
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,076
Clark.

382
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,343
When I was looking into Ryan's condition...

383
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,216
...I found that some scientists
think the type of tumor he has...

384
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,416
...can give a person ESP-like abilities.
- What are you saying?

385
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,686
Ryan is unnervingly insightful.

386
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,296
I think he may be able to read
people's minds.

387
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:37,132
Are you even interested in helping Ryan?
Or just exploiting him too?

388
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:40,635
I just spent three hours on the phone
tracking this doctor down.

389
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,329
What do you think?

390
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:43,999
I'm sorry.

391
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:46,871
I understand what you're going through,
but sometimes...

392
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:50,811
...no matter how much you want to save
someone, there's nothing you can do.

393
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,017
I'm not gonna let Ryan down.

394
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:02,817
When my mother got sick, I spent my time
researching doctors and treatments.

395
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:06,725
But the most important thing I could
have done was spend time with her.

396
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,397
By the time I realized that,
it was too late.

397
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:16,738
I wasn't at her side when she passed,
Clark. Don't make the same mistake I did.

398
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,645
I'm not gonna let him die, Lex.

399
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,166
Hey.

400
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,970
Brought you some comics.

401
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,512
- Clark beat you to it.
- Yeah?

402
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,511
Well, I bet he didn't bring you number 66.

403
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:02,814
That's the rarest issue.

404
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:06,354
It's the one where Devilicus
turned against Warrior Angel.

405
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:09,458
- Weren't they best friends?
- Once upon a time.

406
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,258
What happened to them?

407
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:16,690
Well, they ruled the Guardian Realm
together...

408
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,430
...until Devilicus told Warrior Angel...

409
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,801
...that they should join forces
and conquer humanity.

410
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:28,512
Together, no one would be able
to stop them.

411
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,116
- What did Warrior Angel say?
- He refused.

412
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:36,049
He believed it was a hero's sacred duty
to protect those weaker than himself.

413
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:41,154
Devilicus thought he was naive and vowed
to destroy him and everything he stood for.

414
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,765
Why do you think Devilicus went bad?

415
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,359
I'm not sure.

416
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,532
Probably wasn't aware of it.

417
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,536
You see, Ryan...

418
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,973
...in life, the road to darkness
is a journey...

419
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,941
...not a light switch.

420
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,784
You should remember that, Lex.

421
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:41,283
- Excuse me, have you seen Dr. Burton?
- Who?

422
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:42,578
This guy, right here.

423
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,450
You just missed him, kid. Right there.

424
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:52,551
Wait!

425
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,894
- Wait!
- Who is that?

426
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,404
Dr. Burton!

427
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:04,097
- What are you doing? Who are you?
- I'm Clark Kent.

428
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:07,642
My friend is really sick. Would you
take a look at these scans?

429
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,949
Doctor, please, by the time you get back,
it'll be too late.

430
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:14,914
- Get your hands in the air now!
- Doctor, please.

431
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:18,847
- I said, hands in the air now!
- Wait a second.

432
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,498
Where's your friend now?

433
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:38,103
Mom, Dad, when's Ryan
gonna be out of surgery?

434
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:41,177
- In a couple of hours.
- Clark...

435
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,849
...I don't think I've ever been
as proud of you as I am right now.

436
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:49,612
Your mother's right, son.
It was an amazing thing that you did.

437
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:53,721
But I hope you understand that even though
you did get Dr. Burton here...

438
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:57,349
...Ryan isn't necessarily out of the woods.
- I know it's no guarantee...

439
00:34:57,528 --> 00:35:00,986
...but I think it's gonna work.
I have a great feeling about it.

440
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,367
Over the past 12 years...

441
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:11,406
...thirty-two city contracts have been
awarded to firms with ties to Mayor Tate.

442
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:14,576
His sweetheart deals have
endangered our environment...

443
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:17,976
...and harmed businesses trying to compete
on an uneven playing field.

444
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:23,712
Can Smallville really afford
another four years of Mayor Tate?

445
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,515
Why are you doing this?

446
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,789
Smallville needs an honest mayor.

447
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:33,823
- Are you planning on running?
- No.

448
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:37,229
But I'm putting my support and money
behind your opponent.

449
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:41,303
You'd save yourself a lot of trouble
by announcing your retirement now.

450
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,639
You can kiss that plant expansion goodbye.

451
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,902
I will see that it never gets approval.

452
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,774
I'm prepared to sacrifice it to defeat you.

453
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:53,212
You know, you're not from here.
People don't like you.

454
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,017
Don't laugh at me.

455
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,847
All it'll take are some fiery campaign
speeches about outside interests...

456
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:02,686
...controlling this community
and you'll start to feel the heat.

457
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:08,465
When Winston Churchill heard
about the attack on Pearl Harbor...

458
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:13,968
...he broke out a bottle of champagne
and said, "We've won the war."

459
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:17,500
His generals looked at him
like he'd lost his mind.

460
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,235
America's Pacific Fleet was wiped out...

461
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:24,438
...France was overrun and the Luftwaffe
was bombing London.

462
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,044
Churchill said America is like a giant boiler.

463
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,751
Light a fire under it...

464
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:36,018
...and there's no limit to the amount
of heat it can generate.

465
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,128
If you start a fire, Mayor Tate...

466
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,997
...you'd better be prepared
to deal with the flames.

467
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,477
Clark.

468
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,579
- Hey, Lana.
- Is there any news?

469
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:59,750
Ryan's still in recovery,
but Dr. Burton is optimistic.

470
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:03,181
- Everything's gonna work out.
- Yeah, I think it is.

471
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,182
Oh, by the way, I took your advice.

472
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:09,850
Chloe and her dad have offered to let me
stay with them until I finish high school.

473
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:14,822
- And Nell's cool with that?
- Not really, but she's agreed to it.

474
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,800
Well, I knew you were a fighter.

475
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,332
It's scary...

476
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,937
...but then I think of Ryan
and everything that he's gone through.

477
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:25,098
It kind of puts things in perspective.

478
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,943
You and Chloe as roommates.

479
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,216
- Did you ever see that coming?
- Not in a million years.

480
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,117
What is it?

481
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,353
Nothing.

482
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,522
It's just you won't be
the girl next door anymore.

483
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:48,122
I'm not going anywhere, Clark.

484
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,437
Maybe now you can give
your telescope to Ryan.

485
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:05,409
Mom?

486
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,553
Clark.

487
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,031
What you reading, buddy?

488
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,798
The infamous aerodrome, huh?

489
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,970
Every year for my birthday,
I'd wish for my own aerodrome.

490
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,676
So I could fly high above the Earth.

491
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:44,348
Up there all my problems would seem
so small and far away.

492
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,252
It's a good idea except for the flying part.

493
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:53,086
This is one of Lex's favorites.

494
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,390
- Would you give it back to him?
- No, you give it to him.

495
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:58,997
When you get out of here.

496
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,432
I know I said
you should be careful of Lex.

497
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,738
But I never told you how much
he admires you.

498
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,005
Promise me you'll keep an eye
on him after I'm gone.

499
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,415
Ryan. Don't talk like that, all right?
You're not going anywhere.

500
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,282
- Clark.
- Look, you don't just give up hope.

501
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:22,949
- There's more doctors we can see.
- You're not listening to me.

502
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:26,390
The doctor said you bought me
a few extra days.

503
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:30,630
I want to spend that time
with my friend.

504
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:41,874
Ryan, what's wrong?

505
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,271
Ryan.

506
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,983
- Ryan, what's wrong?
- It's so loud in here.

507
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:57,260
All right, look. I'll take you
somewhere quiet, all right?

508
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,376
What do you think?

509
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,710
It's peaceful.

510
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,217
I thought you were afraid of flying.

511
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,447
Not when I have you here to protect me.

512
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,922
Thanks, Clark.

513
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,420
For what?

514
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,394
This moment.

515
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,994
It's perfect.

516
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:47,134
I don't want you to be angry or sad.

517
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,940
You changed my life.

518
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,714
You're gonna change
a lot of people's lives, Clark.

519
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,313
Promise me you'll never give up.

520
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,154
I promise.
