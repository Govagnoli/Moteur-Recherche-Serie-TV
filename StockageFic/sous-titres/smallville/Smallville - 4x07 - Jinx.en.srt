1
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:04,710
Here's the kickoff

2
00:00:04,996 --> 00:00:09,042
The winner of today's game will move on to
the state championship 1 week from today

3
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:16,948
Play your game, buddy.

4
00:00:20,632 --> 00:00:25,496
A victory today will send the crows to
the state championship.

5
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:32,462
So, are you the guy?

6
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:35,908
I guess that depends on what
you're looking for.

7
00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:40,633
Mikhail Mxyzl...

8
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:43,157
Mxyzptlk.

9
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:45,530
Let me guess, you want to buy a vowel.

10
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:48,178
No, I just wanted to put 80 on the game.

11
00:00:48,197 --> 00:00:53,175
You mean the game that started already.
Sorry I can't take a bet after the kickoff.

12
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:58,266
Rookie, huh?

13
00:00:58,998 --> 00:01:03,041
Well, maybe in your case,
I'll make an exception.

14
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:08,133
Thanks. Can you
put me down for Smallville to win?

15
00:01:09,464 --> 00:01:14,151
You sure about that? I have a funny
feeling about the quarterback today.

16
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:18,398
Well, as much as I hate to admit it, I
never bet against Clark Kent.

17
00:01:19,043 --> 00:01:22,917
Suit yourself. Don't say I didn't warn you.

18
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:26,739
Rule #1- A bet is a bet.

19
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:08,789
Alright guys here we go.
Ready?

20
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:13,135
Blue 32, Blue 32...
HUT!

21
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,042
Trip.

22
00:02:43,192 --> 00:02:46,515
Touchdown! Crows win the game!
Unbelievable!

23
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
fdfdfd

24
00:04:28,145 --> 00:04:29,836
Is he okay?

25
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,684
His collarbone's broken in 2 places.

26
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:37,478
I can't figure out how you could pommel
a guy that outweighs you by 100 pounds,

27
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:39,995
and shatter his collarbone.

28
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:41,961
I'm sorry.

29
00:04:43,309 --> 00:04:47,163
Must have been an accident, I mean,
I got a surge of adrenaline.

30
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:50,729
Adrenaline doesn't explain the fact that
you went from chucking bails of hay

31
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,247
to chucking 60-yard passes overnight.

32
00:04:53,953 --> 00:04:57,450
I guess I'm a fast learner, you said
yourself I was a natural.

33
00:04:57,513 --> 00:05:00,812
A natural who adamantly refuses to get a
doctor after he collapsed 2 weeks ago.

34
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:02,652
What are you trying to say?

35
00:05:02,713 --> 00:05:08,024
Coach Quigley thinks you're on some kind
of performance-enhancing drug.

36
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:11,626
Like steroids?

37
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:14,669
What do you think?

38
00:05:15,142 --> 00:05:19,923
I put myself on the line and said there's
no way Clark Kent would do that.

39
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:23,822
I'm not on drugs.

40
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:28,755
I hope not. Because if it comes out you're
not on the same playing field as these guys,

41
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:34,029
it's gonna be pretty disappointing to
forfeit an entire championship season.

42
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:39,177
And a college career.

43
00:05:52,383 --> 00:05:56,658
I can't imagine what it must have been
like to grow up in a war-torn country.

44
00:05:57,051 --> 00:06:01,958
Obviously. This is as far you can get
from scavenging the street, but,

45
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:08,797
Growing up 'hand-to-mouth' does tend to
make you resourceful.

46
00:06:10,444 --> 00:06:15,276
Resourceful enough to get the attention of
my father's LuthorCorp foreign scholarship.

47
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,009
So how do you like Smallville high

48
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:24,710
I think it is the perfect place for me to
make my American dream.

49
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:30,285
There are many opportunities,
and the girls are... pretty.

50
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:35,520
I hope the classes aren't
too difficult for you.

51
00:06:38,861 --> 00:06:44,211
I reviewed your application; I must say I was
surprised by your poor test scores and grades.

52
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:53,065
Look Mikhail, I'm just curious why
my father would award a scholarship,

53
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:58,607
historically earmarked for future Nobel-
prize-winners to a perennial 'C' student.

54
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:00,598
You want to send me back.

55
00:07:01,443 --> 00:07:02,761
No.

56
00:07:03,254 --> 00:07:06,225
I'd just like to know
what you're really doing here.

57
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,848
What potential did my father
see in you, Mikhail?

58
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:13,099
Cut.

59
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:23,730
Potential you do not see on a
report card, Mr. Luthor.

60
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:39,937
Hey!

61
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:44,434
I didn't realize bookies made house calls,
especially after-hours.

62
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:47,590
Well, I guess I just walked into
the Lion's mouth, eh?

63
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:49,956
What are you talking about?

64
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:55,013
You're a first timer, and you show up at the
end of the season, I asked some questions.

65
00:07:55,963 --> 00:08:02,174
I don't think it is coincidence that you are
Smallville's most notorious whistle-blower.

66
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,538
Notorious, huh? I like the sound of that.

67
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,953
This bet was just research for the article?
- Front page if you play your cards right.

68
00:08:12,697 --> 00:08:18,193
I don't suppose that being a local
celebrity will be good for business.

69
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:21,559
I think maybe you should
change professions.

70
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:25,037
You just found my Achille's Heel.

71
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:30,073
- What, greed?
- No, pretty girls with infectious smiles.

72
00:08:32,885 --> 00:08:36,498
I'm still writing the article.

73
00:08:36,844 --> 00:08:41,800
If you don't even know when to place a bet,
I don't think you have the inside scoop

74
00:08:41,864 --> 00:08:46,992
you're looking for. Promise not to mention
my name, and I'll let you 'shadow' me, I'll

75
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:52,189
be your personal escort through
the seedier parts of Smallville.

76
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:58,378
If I cut you a break, I expect a full
behind-the-scenes story.

77
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:03,123
Of course, and the first stop
is the Winner's Circle.

78
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:17,805
So, what are you going to do
with the money?

79
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:23,038
- Textbooks
- Ooh, don't go too crazy, huh?

80
00:09:23,373 --> 00:09:28,334
My dad's on unemployment, so my college
fund took a massive hit this year.

81
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:32,948
How would you like to make enough money to
pay an entire semester of tuition

82
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:36,296
before you wake up
tomorrow morning?

83
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:41,219
I have to go to the Shark's game
in Metropolis tonight. Sharks...

84
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,402
8-to-1.

85
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:48,557
Chloe, if you want the big article you have
to get inside the mind of a gambler.

86
00:09:48,902 --> 00:09:51,373
You have to be ready to raise the stakes.

87
00:09:51,553 --> 00:09:55,215
That is, if you aren't scared.

88
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,550
Count me in.

89
00:10:13,163 --> 00:10:16,507
There's more to life than
championships, Clark.

90
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:19,589
I bet it's easy to say that when
you have one.

91
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:23,649
Dad, when I put on that uniform,
it's like I forget who I am,

92
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:28,099
but at the same time, I've never known
myself better. It's more than just a game.

93
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:33,258
Clark, I allowed you join the football
team because I though you understood

94
00:10:33,314 --> 00:10:35,300
your responsibility not to let anybody
get hurt out there.

95
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,239
And I accepted that responsibility because
I know I can control my abilities.

96
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:42,050
Then explain to me why there's a kid lying
in a hospital bed right now?

97
00:10:42,113 --> 00:10:45,493
Have you ever seen me trip... Ever?

98
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:49,504
Something happened out on that field,
it's like I couldn't control my own legs!

99
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:53,279
Just because you are strong, doesn't mean
you can't get rattled out there like

100
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:58,361
anybody else. I'm sorry but the last place
you should be is on that football field and

101
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:04,741
you know it. Coach Quigley's at the party
tonight. I'll call him and be the bad guy.

102
00:11:04,806 --> 00:11:09,893
No, Dad. Like you said,
It's my responsibility.

103
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:32,107
Coach, can I talk to you for a second?

104
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:33,971
What's up?

105
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:38,985
Kent, you saved the day! What a play!
You put us in the championship!

106
00:11:39,272 --> 00:11:42,036
No, the team put us in the championship.

107
00:11:43,011 --> 00:11:46,443
- I can see the ring on my finger already.
- I can see the scholarships lined up.

108
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:50,847
Clark, you're here!

109
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:07,366
Coach, coach, coach!

110
00:12:11,641 --> 00:12:15,125
Topeka West may have 3 titles under it's belt,

111
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:19,647
but I know we have a real shot at the
championship, and this year we have it all.

112
00:12:20,418 --> 00:12:23,857
An inpenetrable defense,
an aggressive offense...

113
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:27,006
And a GOLDEN ARM!

114
00:12:29,577 --> 00:12:33,969
Let's go take the title home!

115
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:38,642
Coach, coach, coach!

116
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:58,976
I like the new textbooks!

117
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,217
Hi! Don't worry, I just took 10 percent
off the top for fun, the rest of my

118
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:07,056
winnings are tucked safely away
for college tuition.

119
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,154
I'm glad that my tip paid off for you.

120
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:12,912
Are you kidding me?
That game was awesome!

121
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:17,250
I haven't had that much fun on a couch
since Johnny Rosenblatt in 5th grade!

122
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:21,869
I mean, all of those painted 'beer-bellies'
and foam hands suddenly make sense

123
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:23,845
when you have something riding on the game!

124
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:28,050
See, why would want to spoil all the fun
by writing that article?

125
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:31,912
Because it just keeps getting
juicier by the minute.

126
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:34,316
Are you sure about that?

127
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:38,128
Why, are you going to do something
to change my mind?

128
00:13:39,012 --> 00:13:41,942
Nice try, you're very cute. But I already
gave you anonymity, and

129
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:45,645
it's going to press tonight.
- But you're only starting to scratch

130
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,000
the surface, and I can give you
so much more 'dirt'.

131
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:53,197
You're just trying to stall
the article, aren't you?

132
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:57,518
I don't think you understand me, Chloe.

133
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:01,463
I always get what I want.

134
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:05,925
On looks, apparently, because your
charm just ran out.

135
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,161
Stop.

136
00:14:10,894 --> 00:14:12,214
Kiss me.

137
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:26,611
This is me asking you nicely.

138
00:14:26,973 --> 00:14:31,950
Now you're going to drop that article,
whether you want to or not.

139
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,134
I've never seen you miss before.

140
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:44,000
I've also never seen you shrink from
responsibility, no matter how difficult.

141
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:47,462
You saw the look on those guys' faces, I
couldn't let them down.

142
00:15:47,507 --> 00:15:51,152
I just thought I could find a way to
play like everyone else.

143
00:15:52,443 --> 00:15:56,612
Clark. Open your hand.

144
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:03,066
What are you doing?

145
00:16:03,326 --> 00:16:05,649
You know how dangerous Kryptonite is!

146
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,028
I always get better after it's gone.

147
00:16:08,043 --> 00:16:10,413
So what if I'm playing sick?
Other guys play injured.

148
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:13,753
And if Dad know I don't have my abilities
and can't hurt anyone.

149
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:18,234
You are not taking meteor rocks on that field,
I know it's hard, you can't make yourself sick!

150
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:20,184
And I can't quit either!

151
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:22,790
Clark, the answer is no.

152
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:27,469
You asked your father if we'd ever seen
you trip before... Never.

153
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,751
Not without Kryptonite.

154
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:37,776
I was so excited to see you get a chance
to be like everyone else, that

155
00:16:38,191 --> 00:16:41,494
I guess I forgot for a moment
that you aren't.

156
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:44,164
I didn't think anything of it when you
tripped, but

157
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:48,015
you've never had mishaps like other kids.

158
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:53,159
Something happened to you out there.

159
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:56,963
And if you really want to play in
the game on Saturday,

160
00:16:56,978 --> 00:17:00,790
you need to find out what it was.

161
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:13,701
It's alright Clark, you can stay.

162
00:17:14,623 --> 00:17:17,519
I thought you had some self-imposed
restraining order against me,

163
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:19,164
does this mean you're talking to me again?

164
00:17:19,183 --> 00:17:22,268
No it just means I'm taking a chance on
getting your Dr. Jekyll side today.

165
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:25,456
What's up with the self-logging?

166
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:27,839
I watching the sports editor's
tape of the game,

167
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:30,860
Trying to figure out what happened, but...

168
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,767
It's like I had no control, like my mind
was sending one message, but my..

169
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:37,649
but your body was getting another.

170
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:38,715
Yeah.

171
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:40,212
It's Mikhail.

172
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,514
The foreign exchange kid?

173
00:17:42,634 --> 00:17:46,329
- Mixa...
- Mxyzptlk. Say that 3 times fast.

174
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,676
He's our new resident 'Puppet Master'.

175
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:51,762
This is kind of embarrassing, but...

176
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,436
he made me kiss him.

177
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:57,297
Made you?

178
00:17:59,576 --> 00:18:02,895
Yeah, it was just like how
you explained your trip,

179
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:05,374
it was like someone else was
controlling me.

180
00:18:05,469 --> 00:18:08,202
Yeah but, why would he want me
to lose the game?

181
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:11,758
Clark, he's the biggest bookie
in the school!

182
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:14,699
The power to control the odds.

183
00:18:14,771 --> 00:18:17,709
Let me do a search on his name.

184
00:18:18,027 --> 00:18:19,368
'0 Matches Found'

185
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,318
I guess I shouldn't be surprised that
Mxyzptlk didn't bring anything up.

186
00:18:25,491 --> 00:18:28,124
Well what's that?

187
00:18:28,722 --> 00:18:33,414
'Did you mean KLTPZYXM?'
It's Mikhail's name backwards.

188
00:18:36,276 --> 00:18:40,771
- Looks like a nursery rhyme gone bad.
- Yeah, it's some legend from

189
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:43,696
the Piatori region in the Balkans.

190
00:18:44,186 --> 00:18:47,412
That's near where Mikhail's from.

191
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:54,025
It says the region's been terrorized for
centuries by a bloodline of people,

192
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:57,277
who can control the hand of luck.

193
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:01,040
It's not exactly luck if they're controlling
people. What does it say about the

194
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,777
backwards name?
- The family changed their name a century

195
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,577
ago and fled the area to escape the stigma
after a village burned to the ground.

196
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,007
Looks like Mikhail's still
running from his heritage.

197
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:15,228
It doesn't exactly say how to stop the
kissing bandit, does it? Oh, here!

198
00:19:15,275 --> 00:19:20,190
According to the legends, the only thing
that stopped them was a plague of locusts.

199
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:24,401
There may be one other force
they didn't count on.

200
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,757
Think about it,
who brought him here in the first place?

201
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:35,361
You want me to deport a LuthorCorp
foreign exchange student?

202
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,305
Gambling on Crows games, isn't a sanctioned
extracurricular activity.

203
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,824
I'm surprised you care so much about
some half-rate bookie.

204
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,009
Or is there something else about
Mikhail you aren't telling me?

205
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:51,085
Lex, you sponsored him, I just thought
you might want to do something about it.

206
00:19:51,126 --> 00:19:53,594
Of course I'll look into it.

207
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:57,884
I'm surprised you didn't go to the principal
first, or Coach Teague.

208
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:01,743
But I see how that can be more
complicated than it sounds.

209
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:06,627
Why would it be more complicated?

210
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,798
Come on.

211
00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:12,873
I can't be the only one who's picked on
Lana's fondness for quarterbacks.

212
00:20:12,883 --> 00:20:15,039
Even retired ones.

213
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:20,558
Yeah, to be honest, it has been hard
to see her with someone else.

214
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:25,816
Don't worry, Paris can have a magical
effect on people, but...

215
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:30,269
the enchantment has a funny way of waning
the longer you're gone.

216
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:34,063
I know Lana. She's never been this
serious about anyone.

217
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:39,675
You sound awfully concerned about that for
someone that let her walk out of his life.

218
00:20:41,661 --> 00:20:45,228
I guess the whole 'If you love them, set
them free' thing kind of backfired.

219
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:49,773
It's not about love, Clark. It's about
what you're willing to do for it.

220
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:53,615
On that field, you'll do whatever
it takes to win.

221
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:56,806
But if you're not willing to
do the same for Lana...

222
00:20:56,817 --> 00:21:00,669
maybe she doesn't mean as much
to you as you think.

223
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:10,376
Clark on steroids.

224
00:21:10,474 --> 00:21:12,696
It's a little hard to picture.

225
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,745
It happens to a lot of guys.

226
00:21:14,803 --> 00:21:18,140
Want so badly to outperform everyone,
before you know it, all they care about

227
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:20,980
is winning, no matter what the cost.

228
00:21:21,175 --> 00:21:23,611
You're not responsible for Clark.

229
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,771
Actually I am.

230
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:29,457
Coach Quigley asked me to give him a drug
test, and I never mentioned it

231
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:32,073
to Clark, so I lied and
said it came back clean.

232
00:21:32,162 --> 00:21:34,266
Why would you do that?

233
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:38,268
I don't know, cause I believe in Clark!
And because he knows about us.

234
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:42,349
I didn't want to stir the waters.
If he wanted to get back at me, all he

235
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:45,638
has to do is tell somebody at the school,
and I lose my job.

236
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:47,831
- Clark wouldn't make it personal.
- Why not?

237
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,934
I can't imagine what I'd do if someone
tried to take you away from me.

238
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:56,119
Nobody took me away from Clark, I left.

239
00:21:56,171 --> 00:21:57,369
Right.

240
00:21:57,438 --> 00:22:02,263
Clark's a big part of the reason why
I took off for Paris in the first place.

241
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:06,885
Oh, that must be from the book of things you
never want to hear about your girlfriend's Ex.

242
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:10,396
Look Jason, I'm with you now and I
couldn't be happier. And I know,

243
00:22:10,472 --> 00:22:13,340
Clark can be unpredictable,

244
00:22:13,606 --> 00:22:16,580
but he knows that you need this job
to stay in college.

245
00:22:19,626 --> 00:22:22,540
I know it's hard because you've been so
close to him...

246
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:25,205
But are you sure you really know him?

247
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:38,848
Don't get me wrong, Mikhail. I appreciate
your entrepreneurial ingenuity,

248
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:42,611
but importing Bookies tends to reflect
poorly on a company.

249
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:44,866
These are just fun games.

250
00:22:45,147 --> 00:22:48,583
The I.N.S. isn't exactly renowned
for their good sportsmanship.

251
00:22:48,644 --> 00:22:51,231
They're revoking your student visa
and sending you back home.

252
00:22:51,284 --> 00:22:54,237
But a man like you could pull strings
to keep me here, yes?

253
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,517
If I wanted to.

254
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:59,591
But whatever talents my father
saw in you,

255
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:04,057
they're not worth the embarrassment you
bring to me and my company.

256
00:23:04,998 --> 00:23:09,335
I've made the arrangements, you'll be
halfway across the Atlantic by morning.

257
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:11,512
You don't really want that.

258
00:23:11,795 --> 00:23:15,152
You want to know why your Dad brought
me here.

259
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:17,641
Not that badly.

260
00:23:18,988 --> 00:23:20,606
What if we make a wager?

261
00:23:20,687 --> 00:23:23,955
Now why would I take a bet when
I can just have you thrown out of here?

262
00:23:23,964 --> 00:23:27,427
Because I know gamblers better than
anybody. You're the caviar kind -

263
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,043
See when you hold everything in your
hand, the only thing that can give you a

264
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:34,533
thrill, is putting your chips on the
one thing that can

265
00:23:34,555 --> 00:23:36,296
slip through your fingers.

266
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:45,714
And what would that one thing be, Mikhail?

267
00:23:46,003 --> 00:23:48,367
Well in this case... Me.

268
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:55,195
How much do you believe in this
quarterback friend of yours, Clark Kent?

269
00:23:57,908 --> 00:24:00,272
The Championship Game?

270
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:02,997
What's the wager?

271
00:24:03,662 --> 00:24:08,631
If the Crows lose, you get Citizenship for
me, and $1 million dollars to start again.

272
00:24:08,842 --> 00:24:10,861
And if the Crows win,

273
00:24:11,288 --> 00:24:14,788
I have a hard time believing
you can cover that bet.

274
00:24:14,794 --> 00:24:18,564
I can't. But the reason your
father brought me here is

275
00:24:18,655 --> 00:24:21,543
far more valuable than just money.

276
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:37,371
Oh look. A real, live, American
football superhero.

277
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:40,886
What are you doing here?

278
00:24:40,915 --> 00:24:45,676
I came here to thank you for ratting
me out to Lex.

279
00:24:45,795 --> 00:24:50,314
It wasn't hard to figure out, I knew Chloe
would squeal, just not to him.

280
00:24:50,941 --> 00:24:52,786
She's too proud.

281
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:56,829
You seemed to be the common denominator, so

282
00:24:56,876 --> 00:25:00,474
you forget, games are my business,

283
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:04,658
so if you don't know the players,
you cannot guess the outcome.

284
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:09,271
I thought you'd be halfway back to the
'village of the damned' by now.

285
00:25:09,358 --> 00:25:12,502
I'm not cursed, Clark.
I am lucky.

286
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:17,480
And on Saturday, the championship game,
I'm going to be very lucky.

287
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:19,542
If you think I'm going to lose
that game for you...

288
00:25:19,543 --> 00:25:24,528
If... when there is an if, there are odds,
and I always beat the odds.

289
00:25:26,018 --> 00:25:27,924
Choke.

290
00:25:29,891 --> 00:25:34,397
For example, the odds in the championship
are based on you playing.

291
00:25:34,693 --> 00:25:39,693
If you don't go out on the field, then my
profit margin takes an unfortunate turn.

292
00:25:39,992 --> 00:25:43,917
That is why you're not going to tell
anyone else about me, and

293
00:25:43,992 --> 00:25:47,236
you're going to be on that field.

294
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,672
Unless, you want to see more of your
buddies in the hospital.

295
00:25:59,414 --> 00:26:01,478
Breathe.

296
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:16,401
- Chloe.
- Hey!

297
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:19,254
Clark, warm-up in 15 minutes.

298
00:26:19,268 --> 00:26:22,442
I sure hope you had better luck with the
locusts than I did with Lex.

299
00:26:22,465 --> 00:26:25,996
They aren't selling biblical plagues on
'Amazon. com', but since every legend

300
00:26:26,026 --> 00:26:29,499
is born in truth, I did look up our
favorite apocalyptic critters.

301
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:33,029
Besides eating crops in a single bound,
what else can they do?

302
00:26:33,106 --> 00:26:36,870
When locusts swarm, they emit an energy
wave to avoid crashing into each other.

303
00:26:36,947 --> 00:26:41,075
Maybe Mikhail's commands operate on a
similar frequency, like a radio signal.

304
00:26:41,136 --> 00:26:44,494
Or a dog whistle, the sound travels but
the human ear doesn't pick it up.

305
00:26:44,525 --> 00:26:47,953
Yeah. What's interesting is once a locust's
signal is jammed, they can't fly anymore

306
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,882
without running into each other.
It's permanent.

307
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:55,616
Maybe all we have to do is find something
that will jam Mikhail's frequency for good.

308
00:26:55,629 --> 00:26:59,171
And I think I know where to find that,
so now we just have to find him.

309
00:26:59,174 --> 00:27:02,487
Knowing his quest for the American Dream,
he's got a lot of bets riding on this game,

310
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:03,611
He'll be here.

311
00:27:03,641 --> 00:27:04,984
- O.K.
- I gotta go.

312
00:27:05,061 --> 00:27:06,211
- Good Luck.
- Thanks.

313
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,449
Greetings Football fans, and welcome
to the Championship game between the

314
00:27:14,547 --> 00:27:19,216
Topeka Valley Huskies, and your
Smallville Crows!

315
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,275
Clark.

316
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,754
What are you doing?

317
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:32,040
You know what Mikhail said. He'd hurt
those guys if I wasn't out there.

318
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:35,963
250 pound guys banging into each other on
a football field is one thing,

319
00:28:36,016 --> 00:28:40,757
but getting hit by you is like getting hit
by a train, it's a big difference, son.

320
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:43,826
I hope that doesn't happen. I think Chloe
and I found a way to stop Mikhail.

321
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,551
Oh Chloe and You think you found a way to
stop. Well I'm sorry son,

322
00:28:47,641 --> 00:28:50,821
thinking is not good enough.
- Dad I know you don't agree with me,

323
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:54,242
but sometimes taking responsibility means
having faith in yourself to make the

324
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:58,798
hard choices.
- It also means accepting the consequences.

325
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:02,798
Every handshake, every hug, every time
I'm out on that field I make the conscious

326
00:29:02,898 --> 00:29:07,234
decision to fall when those guys hit me
so they don't get hurt.

327
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:12,639
No matter how hard you try,
you can't understand that.

328
00:29:13,872 --> 00:29:17,300
That's why it's my decision, not yours.

329
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,415
You're starting to sound more and more
like your father.

330
00:29:36,405 --> 00:29:38,485
I hope so, Dad.

331
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,471
Trip.

332
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:30,172
Alright, let's go, let's go, come on!

333
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,379
Fumble.

334
00:32:57,494 --> 00:32:59,354
I knew it was you Chloe!

335
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,477
Stop.

336
00:33:02,938 --> 00:33:07,420
Looks like someone's been broken. Sucks
when you have to play fair doesn't it?

337
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:12,434
In my country, you don't survive if you
can't adapt to the unexpected.

338
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,760
1st down, the Huskies call
their last time-out!

339
00:33:30,073 --> 00:33:31,860
Clark.

340
00:33:34,926 --> 00:33:37,226
What are you doing here?

341
00:33:38,505 --> 00:33:41,448
Here's how the last play in my game goes.

342
00:33:41,543 --> 00:33:45,218
The Crows score another touchdown,
Chloe's dead.

343
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:50,018
If you don't go on the field right now,
and lose the game...

344
00:33:50,282 --> 00:33:51,947
Chloe's dead.

345
00:33:57,061 --> 00:33:59,752
Kent. Let's go.

346
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:05,177
We need an 'Ace-back Montana Post'.
This is it. It's for the title.

347
00:34:08,725 --> 00:34:12,548
Crows have it 1st and 10 on
the 50-yard line.

348
00:34:12,662 --> 00:34:17,533
5 seconds remaining on the clock.
Smallville has one more play.

349
00:34:28,154 --> 00:34:30,155
Blue, 32!

350
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:42,920
Hut!

351
00:35:40,548 --> 00:35:44,248
Touchdown! The Crows win!

352
00:35:46,193 --> 00:35:50,627
Clark Kent makes another
unbelievable play!

353
00:36:00,711 --> 00:36:03,939
Come on, man! We're missing the party!

354
00:36:25,738 --> 00:36:30,152
Looks like championship quarterbacks
no longer have a curfew, huh?

355
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:33,606
I'm late...
Sorry.

356
00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:40,096
Clark.

357
00:36:41,183 --> 00:36:44,830
Your mother and I know that Mikhail
was arrested.

358
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:50,263
Now, when I was out on that same field,
all I had to worry about

359
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:54,500
was completing the next pass, or whether
or not I was going to get tackled.

360
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,700
We're very proud of you.

361
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:00,727
For everything.

362
00:37:03,942 --> 00:37:07,492
- Hey you, come on. Night.
- Good night.

363
00:37:10,221 --> 00:37:13,957
I don't know what it is with you, but no
matter how many times I put you in the

364
00:37:14,049 --> 00:37:15,981
penalty box, it never sticks.

365
00:37:16,075 --> 00:37:19,322
I hear you're quite the hero tonight,
Clark Kent.

366
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:22,188
Yeah well, if it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't have won the game.

367
00:37:22,258 --> 00:37:24,609
Yeah well, you can thank Uncle Sam
for that.

368
00:37:24,646 --> 00:37:26,335
My Uncle Sam.

369
00:37:26,493 --> 00:37:29,656
It's amazing the access a 3-star-General
has to cool toys. And you never know when

370
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:34,329
a jamming device for Stealth Fighters
will come in handy in a football game!

371
00:37:34,411 --> 00:37:37,235
Because of that jamming device, Mikhail
can't control anyone anymore.

372
00:37:37,281 --> 00:37:38,395
Awesome.

373
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,383
But what I don't understand is how I
miraculously came untied.

374
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:49,259
And what I don't understand is how you got
sucked into anything besides anonymous tips.

375
00:37:49,281 --> 00:37:53,893
Well, we all have our weaknesses, I guess.

376
00:37:53,987 --> 00:37:56,563
Except for you, of course.

377
00:38:12,514 --> 00:38:17,424
I think you'll find your new accommodations
a lot more comfortable than county lock-up.

378
00:38:19,176 --> 00:38:21,973
And where are you taking me?

379
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,692
Don't worry.

380
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,180
You're going to have a lot of company.

381
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:33,587
I'm not worried, I have the feeling I
can learn a lot from you, but

382
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,328
I'm just sorry we can't make
good on our agreement.

383
00:38:37,345 --> 00:38:39,944
You underestimate the value of my winnings.

384
00:38:39,972 --> 00:38:43,269
I told you Mr. Luthor,
I've lost my talent.

385
00:38:43,269 --> 00:38:46,031
Mikhail, if there's one thing I've learned

386
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:49,709
is that anything lost,
can be found again.

387
00:38:49,818 --> 00:38:53,706
If you knew I had a special talent,
then why did you bet against me?

388
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,062
I didn't.

389
00:38:55,104 --> 00:38:57,300
I bet on Clark Kent.

390
00:39:12,696 --> 00:39:14,855
Like I said...

391
00:39:15,014 --> 00:39:17,435
You're not alone.

392
00:39:27,328 --> 00:39:28,804
Lana.

393
00:39:29,082 --> 00:39:32,146
Where's Jason? I've been looking for him,
I actually left him 3 messages.

394
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,744
Yeah I know.

395
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:38,808
I thought he'd want to know that Metropolis
University offered me a scholarship.

396
00:39:39,648 --> 00:39:41,282
That's great Clark.

397
00:39:42,944 --> 00:39:45,768
One of the scouts he called saw me
in the game.

398
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:47,983
I wanted to thank him for trusting me.

399
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:51,474
Well it's too bad that you couldn't
return the favor.

400
00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:54,694
Jason was fired this morning.

401
00:40:10,747 --> 00:40:14,599
It's good to know the local football star
still has time for his friends.

402
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,566
I wouldn't put it like that.

403
00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:19,605
Wild guess.

404
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:23,664
You're not talking about the
'football star' part.

405
00:40:24,907 --> 00:40:27,170
Maybe I wasn't clear.

406
00:40:27,255 --> 00:40:30,999
But what you and I talk about is
supposed to stay between us.

407
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:33,835
I see.

408
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:38,419
So today I'm taking the role of the
despicable untrustworthy friend, and

409
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:42,021
as usual our hero is making the fatal flaw
of jumping to conclusions.

410
00:40:42,061 --> 00:40:45,662
You're going to tell me you weren't
the one who got Jason fired?

411
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:50,082
A teacher-student liason is a taboo
that's pretty hard to come back from.

412
00:40:50,154 --> 00:40:53,199
Oh, you're going to take the moral
high ground on this?

413
00:40:53,213 --> 00:40:57,245
Clark, I'd hate to see Lana's infatuation
earn her a 'Scarlet Letter' around town.

414
00:40:57,267 --> 00:41:00,520
Well she has you to thank for that!
Cause you and I were the only two who

415
00:41:00,616 --> 00:41:03,211
knew about it, now everybody's talking.

416
00:41:03,644 --> 00:41:06,974
You didn't do this to protect her.

417
00:41:09,297 --> 00:41:13,341
You know Lana isn't meant to be with Jason.

418
00:41:14,301 --> 00:41:18,521
Maybe a year ago, I would've believed that
you got him fired out of some twisted

419
00:41:18,555 --> 00:41:23,036
loyalty for being my friend. But you
didn't do this for me.

420
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,686
Why did you do it?
