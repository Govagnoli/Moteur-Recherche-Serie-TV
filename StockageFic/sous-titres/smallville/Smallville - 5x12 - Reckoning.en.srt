1
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,870
I brought gloves and a scarf,
like you said.

2
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,238
- I was afraid you weren't gonna come.
- Well, to be honest...

3
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,436
<i>...I</i> don't think that a mystery <i>date's...</i>

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,397
...exactly what our relationship needs.

5
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,631
That's why I called.

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,357
Are you okay?

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,313
Oh, my God. Your heart's racing.

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,833
Because I'm terrified.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,638
What's going on?

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,829
Lana, the way you've <i>been...</i>

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,079
I can tell by the way you look at me
that I'm losing you.

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,635
- Clark...
- And it's not your fault.

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,917
There's something I should've shown you
a long time ago.

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,239
I don't remember
this place ever being here.

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,879
How'd you find it?

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,235
It was left here for me.

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,158
For you?

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,793
I rehearsed this like a thousand times.

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,469
Lana, what I'm about to show <i>you...</i>

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,234
...may change the way you feel
about me.

21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,590
Clark, whatever it is, it's okay.

22
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,432
It's okay.

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,310
Do you trust me?

24
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,472
Oh, my God.

25
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,833
When you asked me if I believed in
life on other planets...

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,468
...you had no idea
how ironic that question was.

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,630
I'm from a planet called Krypton.

28
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,715
But you're just like everyone else.

29
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,792
This isn't the first time you've done that,
is it?

30
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,348
How many times have you been there
when I didn't know it, saving me?

31
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,229
It doesn't matter, Lana.
I couldn't let anything happen to you.

32
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,919
And no one knew.

33
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,792
There were so many days
I wanted to tell you.

34
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,232
What makes today any different?

35
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,316
I want you to know who I really am.

36
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,072
Will you marry me?

37
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,953
- That's the worst joke I ever heard.
- Come on, you liked it.

38
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,109
I didn't.

39
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,510
I thought you were gonna meet us
at the polls.

40
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,238
I kinda took a shortcut.

41
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,391
Get this loaded up
before the victory party.

42
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,358
I appreciate your confidence,
but I haven't won anything yet.

43
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,034
Mom, Dad, I have something important
to tell you.

44
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,229
I told Lana everything.

45
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,878
What?

46
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,597
Right before I proposed to her,
in the fortress.

47
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,035
So, what did she say?

48
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,038
I asked her not to tell me.
It's a lot to put on her at once.

49
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,839
Clark, have you really
thought this whole thing through?

50
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,190
If I was ever gonna risk sharing
who I am...

51
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,634
...I want it to be with her.

52
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,119
I'm proud of you, clark.

53
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,313
I know this has been weighing
on you for a long time.

54
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,477
Just like with this election,
any big decision has risks with it.

55
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,151
I guess it's just <i>hard...</i>

56
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,029
...Iooking over at your son
and realizing you're talking to a man.

57
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,038
A man who doesn't need
his father's advice anymore.

58
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,395
I'm always gonna need you, Dad.

59
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,558
Any exit poll results for the 39th yet?

60
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,077
Yeah, I know it's early,
but patience isn't my strong suit.

61
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,753
Okay. Call me back.

62
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,353
Oh, yeah.

63
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,158
Thanks.

64
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,869
I try to keep the junk food
so I can't reach it.

65
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,238
But some days
it's easier to reach than others.

66
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,714
Sorry I'm late.

67
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,198
I'm glad you're here.
The decorating committee can't bunt.

68
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,430
Can you grab that for me?

69
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,993
Okay, spill it.

70
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,152
It's nothing.

71
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,433
Three guesses: Tall, dark
and bumbling.

72
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,317
It's <i>just...</i>

73
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,754
Okay, what would you do
if you thought...

74
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,353
...you knew someone well...

75
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,796
<i>...and</i> it turns out that <i>there's...</i>

76
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,276
There's this whole other side to them?

77
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,517
Well, that depends.
Are we in arms-dealer territory...

78
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,830
...or are we talking <i>The Crying Game?</i>

79
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,036
Nothing like that.

80
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,756
Then I guess the question is...

81
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,957
...does it change the way you feel
about him?

82
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,193
Maybe.

83
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,312
Look, I don't know what's going on.

84
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,157
But I would be lucky to end up with
someone as honorable as Clark someday.

85
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,392
- You told Lana your secret?
- Yeah.

86
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,199
Okay.

87
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,148
God, and after all those years
of me yanking on your closet door...

88
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,914
...what's the reason
for this sudden coming-out party?

89
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,514
It was only a matter of weeks
before she broke it off.

90
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,716
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

91
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,509
You guys are, like, meant for each other.
You're Kansas' Ken and Barbie.

92
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,477
Except they broke up, which is weird.

93
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,916
- You're fired!
- You can't fire me! I quit!

94
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,713
Well, I think I was pushing Lana
to the point...

95
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,269
...where I don't know
we could have come back from.

96
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,000
And I love her too much
to let that happen.

97
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,072
So how did she take the whole
"E.T. Phone home" thing?

98
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,754
Not sure yet. I was hoping
she would've called by now.

99
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,953
Hello?

100
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,836
No, this isn't Mr. Fu's Noodle House.
Sorry.

101
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,717
Clark, if Lana cares about you
as much as I know she does...

102
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,633
...I seriously doubt
anything's gonna change.

103
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,957
One thing might.

104
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,355
I haven't gotten my answer yet.

105
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,958
I asked her to marry me.

106
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,712
Well, that one wasn't on the Doppler.

107
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,869
Not even a blip.

108
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,519
I know what you're gonna say.

109
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,478
That we're too young,
there's a reason I hadn't told <i>her...</i>

110
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,029
- ...that there's too much at stake...
- That's <i>funny...</i>

111
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,237
...because what I was gonna say is,
there are few people...

112
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,550
...who really know what they want...

113
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,593
...and are willing to risk everything for it.

114
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,872
If anyone deserves to be happy, Clark,
it's you.

115
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,037
I thought I'd see you at the party.

116
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,758
I know.

117
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,559
But then there'd be all those people.

118
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,158
Do I look different to you now?

119
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,394
Clark, you look like the same
handsome guy I've always known.

120
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,388
Handsome as in,
"I want to spend my life with you"?

121
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,998
Or handsome as,
"I'm gonna let you down easy"?

122
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,314
As in, "Yes, clark, I'll marry you."

123
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,438
- Can you fix this necklace?
- Thanks. Let me get this for you.

124
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,637
One more district and you'll have
a new commute to Topeka.

125
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,759
Whatever the outcome, sweetheart,
the only victory that's changed my <i>life...</i>

126
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,717
...was when I won your heart.

127
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,995
Mr. Kent. Mr. Kent, sir, this way.
Man of the hour, Jonathan Kent.

128
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,357
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

129
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,028
Mom, Dad...

130
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,599
Mr. And Mrs. Kent...

131
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,275
...I know that this is as much
a surprise for you as it is for me.

132
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,950
Lana, we couldn't imagine clark
spending his life with anyone but you.

133
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,714
We hope that you have
as many happy years as we have.

134
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,950
- Thank you.
- Let me see this.

135
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,635
- Everyone. Everyone.
- Ah, it's beautiful.

136
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,154
I just got the heads-up
from the newsroom.

137
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,269
And, ladies and gentlemen,
you are looking at our new senator.

138
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,236
<i>We can call the tightly contested</i>
<i>Lowell County Senate race.</i>

139
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,789
<i>Jonathan Kent's been</i>
<i>elected to the Kansas Senate...</i>

140
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,759
<i>... in a staggering upset over</i>
<i>corporate mogul, Lex Luthor.</i>

141
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,319
All right.

142
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,751
Okay, Mr. Kent, I need to wrangle
you guys over here for a photo shoot.

143
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,239
All right.

144
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,832
- Excuse me.
- Mr. Kent.

145
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,436
Oh, hey, oh, thank you, thank you.
Looks like the congratulations...

146
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,999
...are already coming in.

147
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,151
I'll be with you in just a second.

148
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,710
This could take a while.

149
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,438
Is this really happening?

150
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,595
Go do your photo op.

151
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,193
You okay?

152
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,875
You sounded pretty upset
in your message.

153
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,796
I probably shouldn't have called.

154
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,669
I shouldn't do a lot of things,
but I seem to do them anyway.

155
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,597
I'm sure you want to get back
to the party. So...

156
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,273
Lex.

157
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,195
I know how hard you worked for this...

158
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,670
<i>...but</i> I don't think you should
take it so personally.

159
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,118
You know how many people
are cheering right now...

160
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,751
...that the spoiled, rich kid lost
to some salt-of-the-earth farmer?

161
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,197
Well, since when do you care
about what other people think?

162
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,991
Since I was branded at birth
with the sins of my father.

163
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,076
Just once, Lana...

164
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,830
...I wanted to get out from under
his shadow, you know?

165
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,790
Earn something on my own.

166
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,113
Well, consider yourself lucky
you never had a father to endure, huh.

167
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,029
I think it's best if we talk about this
when you're not drunk.

168
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,234
See...

169
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,957
Now I've hurt your feelings.

170
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,432
Perfect.

171
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,353
Through this whole campaign...

172
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,988
<i>...I've</i> managed to alienate
everyone I care about.

173
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,594
I can't lose you too.

174
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,512
Lex.

175
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,439
Hey.

176
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,957
You aren't going to lose me.

177
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,515
Well, I guess it's a bigger day
than I thought.

178
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,955
Yeah. You know, it happened so fast.

179
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,759
We never really got a chance
to tell anyone about it.

180
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,393
Yeah.

181
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,752
So after all the lies he told you,
you still chose him.

182
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,835
- You don't understand.
- How many times have you come to me...

183
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,149
...wondering what clark's
keeping from you.

184
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,837
Why he disappeared to Metropolis
for months.

185
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,549
How he rose from the dead.

186
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,870
It's not like that now.

187
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,792
Really?

188
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,632
Come on.

189
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,438
Lana.

190
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,432
I know you.

191
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,078
You'd never say yes
with all the doubts you have.

192
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,475
Whatever it is he's been covering up
all this time...

193
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,070
You know, don't you?

194
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,438
Clark isn't hiding anything, Lex.

195
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,836
After everything I've done for <i>you...</i>

196
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,235
...how could you lie to me?

197
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,116
Tell me!

198
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,958
Lana, where'd you go?

199
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,398
Clark, I'm so sorry.
I went to see Lex.

200
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,913
And he was really drunk.

201
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,799
What happened?

202
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,280
He knows.
I don't know how he could <i>tell...</i>

203
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,954
...but he could tell
I was hiding your secret.

204
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,111
I didn't say anything to him.

205
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,033
- But he got really angry.
- Lana, that's okay.

206
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,918
Where are you now?

207
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,478
I'm on Route 40,
right before Loeb Bridge.

208
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,357
Oh, God.

209
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,954
- Oh, God, he's coming after me.
- Lana.

210
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,831
Lana! Lana!

211
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,479
Just pull over so we can talk.

212
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,159
Lana, watch out!

213
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,192
No, no. Lana!

214
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,077
Hurry, George.

215
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,390
- Come here, come on. Clark.
- Lana!

216
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,039
- Come here. Come on.
- Lana!

217
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,599
- No!
- Lana!

218
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,113
No!

219
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,358
There's nothing you could've done.

220
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,238
Nothing.

221
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,949
How could you take her away from me?

222
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,238
Human life is fragile, my son.

223
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,278
You knew a life would be exchanged
for yours.

224
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,795
Don't make her pay for my mistake.

225
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,518
If I hadn't told her the truth about me,
she'd still be alive!

226
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,998
You have to let me fix it.

227
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,436
Your powers on Earth
may seem extraordinary, Kal-EI.

228
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,909
But we are not gods.

229
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,914
This is not her destiny!

230
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,230
And you know that!

231
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,828
There has to be a way.

232
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,796
There has to be a way to...
To fix this.

233
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,076
- Please.
- There is one trial...

234
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,117
...you have yet to experience.

235
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,475
But you must heed my warning.

236
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,552
The tide of fate is impossible to stop.

237
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,315
Even if you are able to alter
one course of events...

238
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,472
...the universe will find a balance.

239
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,108
There is only one crystal.

240
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,955
Once you make this choice,
there is no second chance.

241
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,588
Decide carefully.

242
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,876
I have to save her.

243
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,390
I brought gloves and a scarf,
like you said.

244
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,917
You're here.

245
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,914
Of course I'm here, clark.

246
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,718
I'm just not sure a mystery <i>date's...</i>

247
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,553
...exactly what our relationship needs
right now.

248
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,988
So where are you taking me?

249
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,719
I just thought
we could spend the day together.

250
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,477
That part, I kind of figured.

251
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,791
But it was the quote,
"day that I'll never forget" <i>...</i>

252
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,269
...that I was a little curious about.

253
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,952
Right.

254
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,999
Well...

255
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,870
I thought we could go for a drive.

256
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,555
Maybe up to the lake. And...

257
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,468
But you know, with this...
This cold snap we're <i>having...</i>

258
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,394
...the bridges are probably iced over.
So we should just stay here.

259
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,878
Don't you think I know by now
when you're lying?

260
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,074
Just... Just say something.
Anything.

261
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,592
You know, it wasn't a big deal.

262
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,432
Really, I mean...

263
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,669
- Trust me. It was...
- Clark.

264
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,315
You know that it goes both ways.

265
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,832
- Lana, l...
- Don't.

266
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,075
Unless it's the truth.

267
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,632
Clark, as much as I love you,
I can't do this anymore.

268
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,115
Lana, you don't understand.

269
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,113
- Lf anything ever happened to you...
- Like what?

270
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,029
What could be worse than losing
the person that you love?

271
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,472
Nothing.

272
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,997
I need a break.

273
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,432
From me?

274
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,239
No.

275
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,478
From us.

276
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,078
She's really done this time.

277
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,071
Done-done?
Or just on a downward slope...

278
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,152
...of the perpetual
Lana-Clark roller coaster?

279
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,399
Really?

280
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,791
- What happened?
- Ready to put on your Wall of Weird hat?

281
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,519
I've lived this day before.

282
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,193
I kind of went back in time.

283
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,875
Right. What'd you do,
spin the Earth backwards on its axis?

284
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,190
You didn't pick up the lottery <i>numbers...</i>

285
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,952
...while you were at it, did you?

286
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,951
You see these flowers?

287
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,795
- They're going to this secretary.
- Margaret?

288
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,157
She's a workaholic.
She hasn't had a date in like a year.

289
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,270
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

290
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,436
And your boss, he's firing someone
right now.

291
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,272
Within the hour! You're fired!

292
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,954
You can't fire me! I quit!

293
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,158
Don't bother. It's a wrong number.

294
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,117
Chinese takeout.

295
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,713
Hello?

296
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,230
No, I'm sorry,
we're all out of egg rolls.

297
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,278
All right, McFly,
do you wanna start with how or why?

298
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,714
Jor-EI.

299
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,871
I went to him
to try to change things back.

300
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,632
Back to what?

301
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,353
The first time around,
I told Lana the truth about me.

302
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,839
And I asked her to marry me.

303
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,071
What?

304
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,277
What...? What...? What did she say?

305
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,799
Yes.

306
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,111
Oh, my God.

307
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,633
What...?

308
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,677
Well, what was my reaction?

309
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,392
A lot like that.

310
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,118
But listen, it was a big mistake.

311
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,158
- Lex was chasing her on Route 40 and...
- Clark.

312
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,475
There was an accident.
I didn't get there in time.

313
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,513
- Why was Lex chasing Lana?
- He figured out she knew my secret.

314
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,911
- It's why I've been afraid to tell her.
- This time you can warn her.

315
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,071
This doesn't mean you have to lie to her.

316
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,952
Chloe, she knew for less than a day.

317
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,554
Someone's always gonna be
trying to find out about me.

318
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,075
As long as we're together,
they'll be watching her.

319
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,674
Don't worry, clark.
We won't let her near that road.

320
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,558
What time is this supposed to happen?

321
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,154
11:02. Problem is,
she's not talking to me.

322
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,676
You could stay with her
and make sure that...

323
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,912
Fate doesn't get a second chance?
I won't leave her side.

324
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,279
Man of the hour, Jonathan Kent.

325
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,272
- Everything all right, Clark?
- Yeah, everything's great.

326
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,279
- Good luck tonight, Dad.
- Thank you.

327
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,589
Hey, you made it.

328
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,474
- Hey.
- Hi.

329
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,710
- How's everything?
- Good. I haven't left her.

330
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,950
<i>Tightly contested</i>
<i>Lowell County Senate race.</i>

331
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,953
<i>Jonathan Kent has just been elected...</i>

332
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,039
- Wait, something's not the same.
- Senator.

333
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,918
Lois?

334
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,318
Lois!

335
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,073
Lois.

336
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,398
Lana? Lana?

337
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,632
Yeah. Hello.

338
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,031
I wanted to be the first
to congratulate you, senator.

339
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,514
There are a few things
I'd like to discuss with <i>you...</i>

340
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,591
<i>...now</i> that we've won.

341
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,554
You okay?

342
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,156
You sounded pretty
upset in your message.

343
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,110
I probably shouldn't have called.

344
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:21,034
I shouldn't do a lot of things,
but I seem to do them anyway.

345
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,997
I'm sure you want to get back
to the party. So...

346
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,152
I was kind of looking for a reason
to get some air.

347
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,199
Clark and I had our last fight.

348
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,677
Last, huh?

349
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,069
I kept waiting for that armor
to crack, but...

350
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,911
I thought that if I was patient enough,
he would finally let me in.

351
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,309
But I guess people
have armor for a reason.

352
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,239
Lana.

353
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,550
I hate to say this...

354
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,869
<i>...but</i> it's possible
clark's never going to trust you.

355
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,711
I don't understand.

356
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,154
Why would you lie
to someone you love?

357
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,832
I wouldn't.

358
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,712
- Wow, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...
- It's okay. It's okay.

359
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,474
- I'm just gonna... I'm gonna go.
- I...

360
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,911
- Let's go.
- Do I really need an audience?

361
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,390
Back to the party. There's lots
of chocolate cake, nine cases of merlot.

362
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,676
You were out.
Have someone take a look at you.

363
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,469
Do you need to haul me to HMO-land
for committing a serious party foul?

364
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,039
Clark.

365
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,192
Clark, I've looked everywhere,
and I can't find Lana.

366
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,555
Lana. Listen, I'm... I'm sorry.

367
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,676
Can we talk about this?

368
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,873
I'm not gonna tell you again.

369
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,358
Watch out!

370
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,793
Lana.

371
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,915
- Lana.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

372
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,877
I'm sorry.

373
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,589
I didn't mean what happened back there.
I was just coming to apologize and...

374
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,196
Lex, let's just forget it ever happened,
all right?

375
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,159
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

376
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,590
Senator Jonathan Kent.

377
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,876
And I didn't expect you
to duck out of your victory party tonight.

378
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,553
But I'm here.

379
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,711
And I'm alone, as you requested.

380
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,199
Good.

381
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,272
So why don't you come down here
and face me, you son of a bitch.

382
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,559
Perhaps a few lessons in tact, senator.

383
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,280
Now that you're gonna be
in the public eye.

384
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,271
Why don't you just cut the crap, Luthor?

385
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,476
I know my campaign accepted funds
from you.

386
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,076
But I also know I'm gonna pay them
all back. I won't owe you a thing.

387
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,630
I wonder how far that virtuous
stance will get you once you're in office.

388
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,236
I just wanna make sure you understand.
You don't have a puppet, here.

389
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,790
I should hope not. I didn't put
my financial and political clout...

390
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,839
...behind a candidate
who would be anyone's puppet.

391
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,876
I envision this rather as a partnership.

392
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,712
The day you and I become partners...

393
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,599
...will be the day...
- Careful. Careful. Careful, senator.

394
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,796
Don't forget, you and <i>I...</i>

395
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,748
...have a common interest.

396
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,471
One that both of us would...

397
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,596
...protect with our lives.

398
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,237
I have nothing but respect for a man...

399
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,119
...who would deliberately
hurl himself into the spotlight...

400
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,998
...with such a...

401
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,477
...dangerous secret
that must stay hidden.

402
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,837
I won't let you destroy my family.

403
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,753
We can withstand anything
you bring down on us...

404
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,319
...because we have each other.

405
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,310
That's what will always separate
the Kents from the Luthors.

406
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,631
Now, why don't you get...

407
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,318
Now, why don't you
get the hell off my property.

408
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,716
What's your dad doing out here?

409
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,196
What?

410
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,558
Dad?

411
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,958
Jonathan? Jonathan!

412
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,350
- Dad? Dad!
- Jonathan!

413
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,080
Dad? Just set him down over here.
Come on, Dad.

414
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,800
Come on. Here, just sit down.

415
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,910
No, Jonathan!

416
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,911
- Dad!
- Oh, God! Jonathan!

417
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,911
- Dad!
- Jonathan!

418
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,399
Dad?

419
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,279
No! Oh, please, not yet!

420
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,715
- No! Jonathan.
- Dad.

421
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,629
No, Jonathan!

422
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,390
I guess it's time, then.

423
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,197
I'm sorry.

424
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,118
Sit down.

425
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,913
Clark.

426
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,393
I know you're blaming yourself,
but this was not your fault.

427
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,830
How can you say that?

428
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,719
I went back to save Lana...

429
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,430
<i>...and</i> now Dad's gone.

430
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,115
Do you think
you could have chosen between them...

431
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,191
<i>...if</i> you'd had the chance?

432
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,158
Clark...

433
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,074
A heart beats only so many times
in a life.

434
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,355
Your father used his
more than anyone I know.

435
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,876
I just don't know how I'm supposed
to be the man he wanted me to be...

436
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,917
...without him here.

437
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,916
You're his son.

438
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,754
You know what's right and wrong.

439
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,516
Whether your father is here with us
or not...

440
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,273
...you're a man he's proud of.

441
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,628
A man he could look up to.

442
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,431
And something tells me
he won't be the only one.

443
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,159
Can I help you with this?

444
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,871
I love you, Mom.

445
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,431
I love you too.

446
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,551
