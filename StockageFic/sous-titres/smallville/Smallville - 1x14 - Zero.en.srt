1
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,160
Let me go.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,560
What do you want from me?

3
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,840
The truth.

4
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,200
- Can I see some ID?
- You must be new here.

5
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,840
Hey, it's okay, let him through.

6
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,200
- Thanks, Kasich.
- No problem.

7
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,320
- She's cute.
- She's engaged.

8
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,440
What do you think?

9
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,840
It's loud.

10
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,080
- How's the VIP room tonight?
- I think we can make some room for you.

11
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,800
I hope you didn't feel obligated
to entertain me.

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,720
Jude's only gone for a couple days.

13
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,600
I don't believe in obligations.
Besides, your fiancé did me a favour.

14
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,120
I wasn't looking forward to a night out
on my own.

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,760
Something tells me you wouldn't
have been alone for very long.

16
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,000
- Two apple martinis.
- Coming up.

17
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,680
"Zero consequences."

18
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,320
That's quite a promise.

19
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,880
Only if it's kept.

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,080
To my good friend Amanda
on her engagement.

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,640
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

22
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,040
What is it?

23
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,720
What are you doing?

24
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,160
- Amanda.
- You said you had to go away...

25
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,480
...on business.
- I can explain, okay? Just wait.

26
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,280
Amanda, wait a sec...

27
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,160
I can explain, Amanda. Just wait.
Amanda!

28
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,000
You son of a bitch.
You did this on purpose.

29
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,840
You did it to yourself.
Amanda deserves better.

30
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,120
Liar! That's what it said in the papers,
but that's not what really happened.

31
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,480
- It's the truth. Read the police reports!
- I know you covered it up.

32
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,640
I don't know how you did it,
but you're gonna pay.

33
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,400
Who are you?

34
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,600
Don't you remember?

35
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,480
You killed me.

36
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,760
Daddy can't save you this time, Lex.

37
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,560
Zero

38
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,360
There is nothing like 50 minutes
of Mr. Austin's English class...

39
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,520
...that works up an appetite.
- Nothing like a student biography...

40
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,000
...due Monday to help me lose mine.
- The biography part...

41
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,960
...or the fact that our student subjects
were randomly assigned?

42
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,440
Pete's convinced that the drawing
was fixed.

43
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,320
There are a dozen ladies in our class,
each worthy of lengthy interrogation.

44
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,360
- I get stuck with Stan Gibson?
- The manager of the student store?

45
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,000
- I hear he's very...
- Efficient?

46
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,840
Funny. I'm about to learn more about
the art of selling "Go Crow" pennants...

47
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,200
...than any human
should have to endure.

48
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,200
You haven't stopped smiling since
we left. Who's your victim?

49
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,560
The illustrious Mr. Kent himself.

50
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,000
- Me?
- I take it back.

51
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,000
Chloe's the one with the challenge.

52
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,640
- Excuse me?
- No offence, Clark...

53
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,840
...but digging up six pages of interesting
on you...

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,480
...is gonna require serious excavation.
- I do stuff.

55
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,760
Yes, and I'm sure that once I deploy
my journalistic skills on you...

56
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,520
...I'll unearth a skeleton or two.

57
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,160
You know, Chloe, this is a class project,
not a corruption scandal.

58
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,720
Relax. It's not like you
have anything to hide, right?

59
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,600
Come on, Clark, cough up.
Who'd you get?

60
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,120
Don't tell me. Lana Lang.

61
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,520
Just look at his face,
you don't even have to see it.

62
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,720
Like I said, definitely rigged.

63
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,720
- I assume you'll start your paper ASAP?
- It's all gonna work out.

64
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,680
I'm helping Lana at the Talon
getting ready for the opening.

65
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,720
Surrogate boyfriend
does the heavy lifting...

66
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,360
...while Whitney
works at his dad's store.

67
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,040
- On that note...
- Wait.

68
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
When are you gonna sit down
to do my interview?

69
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,760
Right. I'll be around.

70
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,080
Did he just blow me off?

71
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,960
One step forward, two steps back.
Come on.

72
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,760
You promised everything would be ready
on time.

73
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,360
That was before the plumbing
started leaking.

74
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,920
- Hasn't been replaced in years.
- How long will that take?

75
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,880
I can't really give you a straight answer,
not until I crawl up there.

76
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,680
You resurrect the past,
you get the problems that come with it.

77
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,640
Lex Luthor's going to be by later.
He's going to need numbers...

78
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,440
...and a timetable
and a better explanation than that.

79
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,360
Sorry, we're not open yet.

80
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,520
It's about the
assistant manager position.

81
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,000
I know I'm late, but if I can get
an application...

82
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,880
- Yeah, yeah, just give me a second.
- Great. Really appreciate this, Miss...?

83
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,280
- Lang.
- Lang.

84
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,040
Just to warn you, my aunt's not taking
any more interviews until next week.

85
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,480
Well, that's all right. I happen
to have all the time in the world.

86
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,840
- I'm Jude Royce.
- Hi.

87
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,040
So I understand that Lex Luthor
has a stake in this project.

88
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,360
Yeah, he's one of the owners.
Why? Do you know him?

89
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,240
- A lifetime ago in Metropolis.
- Must have been interesting.

90
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,200
Well, let's just say there's a reason
he's in Smallville.

91
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,920
You know my advice?
Stay away from him.

92
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,840
When Lex gets involved,
things usually turn out badly.

93
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,040
What are you doing here?
We had an understanding.

94
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,480
After that night,
we were never to have any contact.

95
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,800
- I saw him, Lex.
- Who?

96
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,720
Jude.

97
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,640
- We both know that's impossible.
- Listen to me! He's alive.

98
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,480
Everywhere I go, I see him.

99
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,160
- He's stalking me.
- Kasich. Calm down.

100
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,400
I'm not crazy.

101
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,600
- This man say what he wanted?
- Yeah. The truth.

102
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,320
Listen. I keep an apartment in the city.

103
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,040
It's very secure. You stay there
and wait for my call.

104
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
- Hey, Lex.
- Hey.

105
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,560
- Who was that?
- Nobody.

106
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,520
I hear we sprung a leak.

107
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,880
Is everything all right?

108
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,680
- Just a little weirded out.
- Relax, it's just a leak.

109
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,160
No, a friend of yours came by, applied
for the assistant manager position.

110
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,880
He told me to stay away from you.

111
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,600
What was his name?

112
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,960
Jude Royce.

113
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,520
- What is it, Lex?
- When did he leave?

114
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,080
Just before you came in.

115
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,600
Lex, who's Jude Royce?

116
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,760
Trust me, Clark,
I have no idea who Lana met today...

117
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,160
...but it couldn't have been him.

118
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,360
Don't worry about it, Clark. I'm not.

119
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,000
What's going on?

120
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,880
I don't know!

121
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,200
Feel under the dash.

122
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,160
Looks like someone decided
to get creative while I was inside.

123
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,120
What were the screams?

124
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,960
I assume it's someone's twisted idea
of a joke.

125
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,880
And a successful one.
We've managed to draw a crowd.

126
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,120
- Lex.
- Clark, this really doesn't concern you.

127
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,920
Hello, anybody home?

128
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,520
Hey, pull up a microphone, son.

129
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,560
- Chloe, what's going on?
- Since I couldn't find you...

130
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,560
...I decided to start my biographical
inquiry at the beginning.

131
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,720
Unlike a certain
so-called friend of mine...

132
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,080
...your parents gracefully agreed
to be interviewed.

133
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,320
Chloe's been asking us
some very interesting questions, Clark.

134
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,640
Thank you. Now, we just
have a few more to go, so...

135
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,280
We were talking about the early days.

136
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,720
Now, what was involved
in adopting Clark?

137
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,880
Well, it was... It was just like
any normal adoption, I guess.

138
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,360
Can you take me through the process?
Did it takes weeks or months?

139
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,600
Did you guys use a lawyer,
or did you go through an agen...?

140
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,680
Shoot. I'm out of tape. That's okay,
I've got some extra C-90s in my car.

141
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,600
I'll be right back.

142
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,080
Chloe's researching your life
for a school project?

143
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,760
- When did that happen?
- We just got the assignment today.

144
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,640
I didn't know she was gonna
go Mike Wallace.

145
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,440
We don't mind talking about you...

146
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,200
...but if she starts asking questions
about the adoption...

147
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,880
What about the adoption?

148
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,640
Is there something I should know?

149
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,600
Well, of course,
we had to make up a story...

150
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,600
...but it's more complicated
than that.

151
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Let's just say it's a subject we
would rather not have anyone explore.

152
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,360
Sorry. Am I interrupting?

153
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,600
Clark, now that you're finally spinning
in my orbit...

154
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,120
...I have a couple
of pertinents for you too.

155
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,320
Actually, this is just a pit stop for me.

156
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,720
I'm on my way to meet Lana
to work on my paper.

157
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,320
You know, Clark, not to strike a
paranoid note, but are you avoiding me?

158
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,120
Tomorrow, I promise.

159
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,520
Okay, this isn't an official question...

160
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,280
...and I don't want you guys to take it
the wrong way...

161
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,400
...but has your son
always been this strange?

162
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,160
- How does it feel?
- Feel?

163
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
To single-handedly
bring the Talon back...

164
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,400
...from the brink of becoming
a parking garage?

165
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,200
It's nice, you know, being counted on,
having responsibility.

166
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,240
- People treat you differently.
- Like you won't break.

167
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,400
Finally feel like I'm shedding
that fairy-princess costume.

168
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,320
- Lex, what are you doing here?
- Contractor called.

169
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,360
Said he had an estimate,
wanted me to meet him here.

170
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,160
What the hell?

171
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,520
Are you okay?

172
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,520
Yeah. I came in the back door
and some guy jumped me...

173
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,400
...and forced me to let him in
and bashed me over the head.

174
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,560
Did you see his face?

175
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,920
No.

176
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,120
Look.

177
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,640
That wasn't there when I locked up.
I'll go call the police.

178
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,120
Lex, your name's on it.

179
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,320
Zero consequences.

180
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,760
How you holding up?

181
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,480
I was fine... until it showed up.

182
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,960
Yeah, stupid question.

183
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,040
What kind of a sick person
would do a thing like that?

184
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,600
I don't know.

185
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,400
But I've never seen Lex
so freaked out before.

186
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,480
Join the club.

187
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,800
That guy warned me. He said everything
Lex touches ends badly.

188
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,640
How much do we really know about him
and his past?

189
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,640
I want you both to know how truly sorry
I am about this.

190
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,720
I promise this won't affect
the grand opening.

191
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,760
We're going to be infamous
before we even open the doors.

192
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,920
Do you know who he is?
The guy in the... You know.

193
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,080
Max Kasich. And yes, I knew him
a long time ago in Metropolis.

194
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,600
Do you have any idea
who might have done this to him?

195
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,080
Not at all.

196
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,160
What about your old friend Jude Royce?

197
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,320
- I doubt it could have been him, Clark.
- Why?

198
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,520
Because he's been dead for three years.

199
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,800
The only information
I got from the Kents...

200
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,640
...was the earth-shattering admission
that Clark hates peas.

201
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,760
A body part shows up at the Talon
and all you can talk about is Clark?

202
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,960
Where are your priorities?
Lex Luthor must be mixed up in this.

203
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,160
I know you've got issues
with the Luthors...

204
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,360
More than issues.
You know what they did to my family.

205
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,320
One piece of investigative information
at a time.

206
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,040
- Now, about Clark...
- Chloe, what do you want from me?

207
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,720
In a world of designer water,
Clark's from the tap.

208
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,520
But you've known him the longest.
All I need is just a little anecdote...

209
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,760
...just a small piece of information
from Clark's deep, dark past.

210
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,360
Well, there was something
back in the first grade.

211
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,360
Thank you! That's more
than I've uncovered the past two days.

212
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,040
Now, please, let's continue.

213
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,880
There was a bully three grades ahead.

214
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,520
This dude was determined
to pound dents into every kid.

215
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,600
One day it was my turn.
He was just about to take my head off...

216
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,040
...when Clark jumped between us.
- So Clark ran interference?

217
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,560
Now, as kind as that sounds, Pete...

218
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,160
...I don't think it falls into
the "something amazing" test.

219
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,720
- What test?
- I'm not finished.

220
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,440
Clark didn't just push Braindead,
he put him through a door...

221
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,000
...as in splinters and broken hinges.
How he did it, I still have no idea.

222
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,160
- Guy was at least twice our size.
- Clark, any comments?

223
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,400
Well, we were, you know, 6 years old.
Twice our size was three feet tall.

224
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,080
If you need more ancient history,
ask the source.

225
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,760
I've got an appointment
at the student store.

226
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,720
Have fun.

227
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,480
And so the mystery
that isn't Clark Kent deepens.

228
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,880
- Mystery?
- Yeah.

229
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,000
Since you continue
to play obstructionist...

230
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,560
...I've had to find information
through other means.

231
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,240
I found that your adoption was done
through Metropolis United Charities...

232
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,480
...but this is the strange part.
They were in business for six months...

233
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,480
...and from what I can tell,
yours is the only adoption they handled.

234
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,280
I can't believe you did this, Chloe.

235
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,440
You didn't know? I just assumed
that your parents would have told you.

236
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,320
- I mean, weren't you interested?
- Why would I be?

237
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,920
My biological parents are either dead
or didn't want me.

238
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,440
- You're prying into my private life.
- I was just trying to be thorough.

239
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,200
This is a class project. I spent an hour
yesterday with Lana, that's it.

240
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,600
That's all I needed.
I'm not some mystery for you to solve.

241
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,640
Clark, I...

242
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,080
Talk to me, Mr. Raines.

243
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,760
According to the doorman, Kasich never
made it to the apartment in Metropolis.

244
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,120
- What about Royce?
- His parents died when he was young.

245
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,680
Car accident. He was
an only child, inherited everything.

246
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,240
And Amanda Rothman?
Have you tracked her down yet?

247
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,840
She moved, left no forwarding address.
When's the last time you spoke to her?

248
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,160
About three years ago.

249
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,280
I'll go wider,
but it could take some time.

250
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,320
It'd help if you tell me
what's going on.

251
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,880
No, it wouldn't.
You're my head of security.

252
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,200
You find her and warn her
she could be in danger.

253
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,360
That's all you need to know.

254
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,160
Make a path. Police.
Excuse me, excuse me. Police.

255
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,360
- Who are you?
- Detective Sam Phelan, Metropolis P.D.

256
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,680
Are you what passes for security
in this zoo?

257
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,840
- Yeah.
- Don't go anywhere. We'll talk.

258
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,480
- Thank God you're here.
- Lex, Lex.

259
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,200
You really put your foot in it this time.

260
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,440
Tell me exactly what happened.

261
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,480
Hey, if you fall apart on me,
I can't help you.

262
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,560
Now what went down?

263
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,920
That's exactly what happened?

264
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,120
Good. Here's how it's gonna go.

265
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,360
You were never here. Your name will not
appear in any papers or the police report.

266
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,360
- How?
- That's what your daddy's money's for.

267
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,400
This one's gonna cost him.

268
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,720
- What about Amanda?
- I'll take care of everybody's story...

269
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,640
...but you are never to see her
or talk to her again. You got it?

270
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,120
Call this guy,
he'll take care of your shoulder.

271
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,840
No emergency rooms.

272
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,120
All right, get out of here.

273
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,600
- Did you see what happened?
- Most of it.

274
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,280
Well, smile. Because you're about to
come into some serious money.

275
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,720
Nothing to say?

276
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,640
I thought Lex Luthor
had all the answers.

277
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,080
Look, you twisted son of a bitch.

278
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,440
- I don't know what you want.
- What happened at Club Zero.

279
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,600
The cover-up.

280
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,360
You know the cop?

281
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,520
The one on the report? Phelan?

282
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,720
He's dead.

283
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,120
It seems you were somehow involved
in that too. I find that very interesting.

284
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,680
Why don't you kill me now?

285
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,160
Because it's more fun
to watch you suffer.

286
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,800
Knowing that at any moment, bang!

287
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,560
Tell me.

288
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,480
What really happened?

289
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,280
Lex!

290
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,640
Lex, you all right?

291
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,440
Clark, what are you doing here?

292
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,120
Your office told me you were here.

293
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,680
I thought I heard someone else.

294
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,600
No. I'm all by myself.

295
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,440
Hey, I looked up Max Kasich.

296
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,640
I know what happened at Club Zero.

297
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,600
That he was shot and killed Jude Royce.
Everyone fits into this except for you.

298
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,720
- What's going on?
- Please, Clark.

299
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,440
For our friendship, I'm asking you
to stay out of this.

300
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,160
Some secrets are better left alone.

301
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,720
Clark.

302
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,360
Come on, son, the cows aren't
gonna feed themselves.

303
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,800
- You have a late night?
- I was helping Lana.

304
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,160
She's not gonna let the whole body-part
incident delay the opening of the Talon.

305
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,000
That's what happens when you get into
business with somebody like Lex Luthor.

306
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,720
If it wasn't for Lex,
the Talon would be a parking garage.

307
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,920
Son, he casts a very, very long shadow.

308
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,040
I just want to make sure
none of you kids get hurt, that's all.

309
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,280
The past is in the past.
The best we can do is look to the future.

310
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,280
All right, you got me.

311
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,600
Speaking of that,
how's Chloe's paper coming along?

312
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,520
I assume she's done
with her interviews?

313
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,160
I'm not sure.

314
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,680
Look, Clark, if she mentions anything
to you about the peas, I'm sorry.

315
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
It's the first thing that came to mind.

316
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,480
And if she mentions anything to me
about the Metropolis United Charities?

317
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,080
I used to think perseverance
was an admirable quality.

318
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,040
Since I learned the real truth,
I hadn't thought about the adoption.

319
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,040
Dad, Chloe told me the agency you used
was only open six months...

320
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,600
...and I was the only kid adopted.

321
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,880
Look, son...

322
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,240
...the process is a really tough one even
when you go through normal channels.

323
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,280
With you, it was just
a little more complicated, that's all.

324
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,880
- Is everything legal?
- Yeah, it's legal, it's just...

325
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,480
Well, it required a higher level of access
than your mother or I had.

326
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,560
What does that mean?

327
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,560
Let's just say it's a long road between
what's sitting in our storm cellar...

328
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,200
...and what's written
on your birth certificate.

329
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,680
- You hear that?
- Hear what?

330
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,320
The whole herd's just over that rise.
We ought to be hearing something.

331
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,840
What do you think happened?

332
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,960
Why would LuthorCorp
dump their stuff here?

333
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,920
I'm gonna go take
from some different angles.

334
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,520
Mr. And Mrs. Kent, I have no idea
how this could have happened...

335
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,360
...but I'll do everything in my power
to find out.

336
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,360
And I'll pay for your livestock, of course.

337
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,800
You think that's how
you solve everything, don't you, Lex?

338
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,760
You sprinkle a little money on it
and hope the problem goes away.

339
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,120
Well, obviously, some things
are a little more difficult than that.

340
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,160
I didn't think it was possible to fall
any further in your father's eyes.

341
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,400
Obviously, I was wrong.

342
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,000
I'd never intentionally allow
something like this to happen.

343
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,520
Does this have anything
to do with Club Zero?

344
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,960
- I think so.
- You need to tell the authorities...

345
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,320
...everything you know.
This isn't just about you anymore.

346
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,160
Mr. Luthor, the C.E.P. Guy
needs to talk to you. He's over there.

347
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,640
Looks like a black mark
on your company's environmental record.

348
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,200
- I'm gonna walk over and get the sheriff.
- And tell him what?

349
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,640
Just tell him that Clark Kent called.
Thank you.

350
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,720
- Who was that?
- I'm trying to reach Lex.

351
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,000
He's not in the office.
He's not at the mansion...

352
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,720
...and his cell phone goes straight
to voice mail.

353
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,280
Where's Dad?

354
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,520
Still supervising
the removal of the cows.

355
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,360
- Lex said he'd pay for that.
- Clark, this isn't just about money.

356
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,640
We don't know
what kind of health threat...

357
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,360
...this poses to us or to our neighbours.

358
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,200
I don't think this is Lex's fault.

359
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,800
Someone is trying to set him up...

360
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,000
...because of what happened
at the nightclub.

361
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,720
Look.

362
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,440
- Until this is cleared up, I don't...
- Lex has always been a good friend.

363
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,560
I know.
I'm usually the one who defends him...

364
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,920
...but there are some things in his past
that are a little shady.

365
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,280
In this family we don't look at the past.

366
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,120
Clark, I grew up in Metropolis,
I know the Luthor world.

367
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,320
It looks glamorous and fun,
but the kids grow up too fast...

368
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,040
...and they can get into trouble.

369
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,920
Whatever's happening to Lex is starting
to affect you.

370
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,440
Body parts in boxes and poisoned cows?
This isn't normal.

371
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,080
What do you want me to do?
Cut him out of my life?

372
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,880
No, I want you to cool it off for a while
until we know what really happened.

373
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,840
Your father and I just don't want to
see you pulled into his problems.

374
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,160
Can I talk to you for a second?

375
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,760
How you doing?

376
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,880
- That depends if it's on the record.
- Okay, I deserve that.

377
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,280
Look, I didn't mean to ambush you
with the whole adoption agency thing.

378
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,240
Hey, you saw a story
and you went right for it.

379
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,440
- That's what journalists do.
- You're right.

380
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
I didn't think about
how it would hurt you.

381
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,800
And, you know,
as much as journalistic instinct rebels...

382
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,200
...I'd rather have a friend
than a subject...

383
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,080
...so I'm dropping the whole thing.

384
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,200
Thank you.

385
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,520
Can I ask you a question?

386
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,240
Totally off the record.

387
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,000
Do you ever wonder
about your biological parents?

388
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,840
Every day of my life.

389
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,880
Looks like I'm not the only one
doing some digging.

390
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,360
- What's Club Zero?
- Part of Lex's past...

391
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,800
...he asked me to stay out of.

392
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,200
By the way, I brought by
some pictures for your parents.

393
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,400
I figured they could use it
for insurance purposes and stuff.

394
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,840
I'll see you later. I gotta go.

395
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,600
Chloe...

396
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,640
...it's the same guy.

397
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,080
- Wait, but he's...
- Dead.

398
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,720
Help!

399
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,720
Somebody!

400
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,560
Help!

401
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,480
Help!

402
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,920
Somebody!

403
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,280
No word from Lex. No one's
spoken to him since this morning.

404
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,240
I pulled our alleged dead guy's license.
It's registered to a John Smith. Original.

405
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,200
He has an address in Metropolis
and does not work for the C.E.P.

406
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,640
- How'd you do that?
- I hacked into the DMV database.

407
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,360
- Sometimes persistence is a good thing.
- Call Metropolis P.D.

408
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,880
- Have them go to that address.
- What's going on?

409
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,920
I think Lex is in serious trouble.

410
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,560
You ready to talk?

411
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,600
You're finally where you should
have been three years ago.

412
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,520
Exposed in the spotlight.

413
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,280
What do you want from me?

414
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,600
The truth about Club Zero.

415
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,920
Kasich.

416
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,960
Excuse me,
did you find anyone else in there?

417
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,000
- You know where I can find Club Zero?
- You're six months too late, kid.

418
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,200
- What do you mean?
- Well, it closed down.

419
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,440
It was an old warehouse
on 78th and Main.

420
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,840
Liar! That's what it said in the papers,
but that's not what really happened.

421
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,320
- It's the truth. Read the police reports!
- I know you covered it up.

422
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,640
I don't know how you did it,
but you're gonna pay.

423
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,200
Who are you?

424
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,360
Don't you remember?

425
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,360
You killed me.

426
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,040
Daddy can't save you this time, Lex.

427
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,440
No more games, Lex.

428
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,000
It's time for the truth.

429
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,960
I know you.
You're the contractor from the Talon.

430
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,320
That's my day job.

431
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,720
Who are you?

432
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,400
Amanda never talked about her family?

433
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,960
She said she had a brother
in Central City.

434
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,040
He was in prison. She was the only
person who kept in touch.

435
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,960
She was my lifeline when I was inside.

436
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,440
I never had a rich daddy
to keep me out of jail.

437
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,080
- I don't understand. What do you want?
- What do I want? What do I want?

438
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,840
I want vengeance for my sister.

439
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,680
What do you mean? Where's Amanda?

440
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,000
She's dead, Lex.

441
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,200
She committed suicide a year ago.

442
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,440
- I never knew.
- Because you cut her out of your life.

443
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,440
She was never the same after Club Zero.
Jude's death devastated her.

444
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,680
He was the love of her life.
You took all that away.

445
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,480
She had nothing to live for.

446
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,160
Who's that?

447
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,400
Lucky break.

448
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,720
Couple weeks after Amanda's funeral...

449
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,120
...I walk into a greasy spoon
in Bludhaven and there he is.

450
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,080
I couldn't believe it.
Short-order cook flipping burgers.

451
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,680
You know how they say everyone in life
has a double? I had to look twice.

452
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,400
I figure if he can fool me,
he can fool you.

453
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,480
Why'd he do it?

454
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,920
He was on parole, needed the money,
and that's when I got the idea.

455
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,200
You ruined Mandy's life, I'd ruin yours.

456
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,720
Mandy's finally gonna get the justice
she deserves.

457
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,640
You were right.

458
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:20,720
You were right. The newspapers,
the police reports, what I told Phelan.

459
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,880
They were all lies. You want the truth?
I'll give it to you.

460
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,880
- No, no, no. You're twisting it again!
- That's what happened!

461
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,200
That's what happened.
Amanda pulled the trigger.

462
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,960
She shot Jude.
I was just trying to protect her.

463
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,400
I'm through with you, Lex!

464
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,480
Killing me won't bring Amanda back.

465
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,560
None of this can change
what happened.

466
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,960
I don't care.

467
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,240
After tonight,
you'll never hurt anyone else.

468
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,040
You can't escape your past, Lex.

469
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,600
Lex!

470
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,840
Get down!
There's a man with a gun up there.

471
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,520
Where? You mean that guy?

472
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,360
- What happened?
- I have no idea.

473
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,760
How'd you find me here?

474
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,720
With a little help from my friends.

475
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,200
- So, what do you think?
- I'm definitely surprised.

476
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,080
Me too.

477
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,240
Where's Chloe?

478
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,800
She said she wanted to be
fashionably late.

479
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,320
I got this for you.

480
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,440
Don't worry, it's not a body part.

481
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,640
It was in the attic.
It was my grandfather's.

482
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,480
It was taken just after the Talon opened.

483
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,800
- You could hang it above the counter.
- Clark, it's amazing. Thank you.

484
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,520
You're welcome.

485
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,120
I better get back to work.

486
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,640
How does it feel?

487
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,640
- Terrifying. Don't tell anybody.
- Your secret's safe with me.

488
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,320
I get the feeling
you're avoiding me, Clark.

489
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,280
I just realized there's a lot
I don't know about you.

490
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,840
You think my dark past
is gonna rub off on you?

491
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,240
I was trying to protect Amanda.

492
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,240
My father wouldn't
raise a finger to help her...

493
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,520
...but I knew he'd do anything
to save his only son.

494
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,040
So you took the fall
and everything was covered up?

495
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,560
Is that really what happened?
Is it the truth?

496
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,680
The truth is, I'd do anything
