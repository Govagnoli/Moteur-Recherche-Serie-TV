1
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:05,918
Thanks.

2
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:09,998
We'll see how far two semesters
of French gets me.

3
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:12,135
Just remember, a smile goes a long way.

4
00:00:12,336 --> 00:00:14,236
Even in Paris.

5
00:00:14,572 --> 00:00:17,006
And to smooth the transition....

6
00:00:18,442 --> 00:00:21,002
-Lex, I already have a ticket.
-I know.

7
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:23,442
I just got you a little upgrade.

8
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:27,277
It's open-ended, for whenever you're ready
to say goodbye to Smallville.

9
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:31,182
-This is first class. I can't accept this.
-You have to. It's a gift.

10
00:00:31,522 --> 00:00:32,784
Trust me.

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,481
This is gonna be a year
you'll never forget.

12
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:41,593
-Clark.
-I didn't mean to interrupt.

13
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:43,728
-I didn't know you were here.
-No.

14
00:00:43,935 --> 00:00:47,268
Lex was just giving me some
last-minute travel tips.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,975
-When is the big day?
-Saturday.

16
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,912
I should probably go.

17
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:03,977
Thanks.

18
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:12,655
Clark, you need to let her go.

19
00:01:14,098 --> 00:01:16,157
I suppose I don't have much of a choice.

20
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,733
She's the one who wanted to leave.

21
00:01:20,104 --> 00:01:23,471
And if there's anybody
who set that ball in motion, it's you.

22
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:27,075
Clark, all Lana's ever wanted is for you
to be honest with her.

23
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:29,212
If you're not willing to step up...

24
00:01:29,413 --> 00:01:32,712
...you need to move aside
and let her get on with her life.

25
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:57,968
Time for lights out. Good night, Emily.

26
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:02,702
Night.

27
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:13,085
Logging off at 21 1 5 hours.

28
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,429
Hello?

29
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,424
You're ruining it.
It's perfect and you're ruining it.

30
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:58,585
You must be Lana.

31
00:03:58,796 --> 00:04:00,764
This place doesn't belong to you.

32
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,335
Miss Lang, I know you put a lot of work
into this coffee shop...

33
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,472
...but you signed the papers.

34
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,315
It belongs to Lana.

35
00:05:30,855 --> 00:05:33,187
Get out there and take your shot.

36
00:05:34,358 --> 00:05:39,386
-Yep. She's moving to Wichita.
-Wichita?

37
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:41,790
Yeah, she got the federal judgeship.

38
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,900
She starts work on Monday.

39
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:46,565
That was fast.

40
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:49,831
-What about your dad?
-Well, he's staying in Smallville.

41
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:53,974
I guess that means they're
going through with the divorce.

42
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:55,509
I'm really sorry, Pete.

43
00:05:55,913 --> 00:05:57,881
I've been avoiding the whole thing...

44
00:05:58,048 --> 00:06:02,678
...because I knew when I finally told you,
it'd-- lt'd definitely sink in.

45
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:06,354
Guess you're the last man standing
in the nuclear family zone.

46
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:11,117
Pete, you're not losing your family,
it's just changing.

47
00:06:11,295 --> 00:06:14,492
It can be hard to find out your
parents are hiding things from you.

48
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:17,359
It's just so weird when you realize
that the people...

49
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:21,994
...you thought had all the answers
are just human like everybody else.

50
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,139
What are you gonna do?

51
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:27,744
I didn't go through three years of high
school just to miss out on senior year.

52
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:32,408
I wish Lana felt that way.

53
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,519
I'm gonna say this once and then it falls
into the "none of my business" category.

54
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,782
The whole yo-yo thing with you and Lana?
It's gotta stop.

55
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:44,291
You sound like Lex.
He thinks I'm the reason Lana's leaving.

56
00:06:44,461 --> 00:06:46,622
I hate to agree with Uncle Fester...

57
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:50,233
...but I don't think Lana's going to Paris
just to see the Mona Lisa.

58
00:06:51,435 --> 00:06:53,335
You ever wish I'd never
told you about me?

59
00:06:56,707 --> 00:07:00,404
It's rough at times,
covering with Chloe and everybody...

60
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:04,914
...but the truth is, no one's ever
put that much trust in me before.

61
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:11,919
You're not thinking about coming clean
with Lana, are you?

62
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:15,354
It might be the only way to stop her
from getting on that plane.

63
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:40,345
-Looks like you could use a garage sale.
-Yeah, you'd think I was....

64
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:42,109
Moving halfway around the world?

65
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:46,186
You know, I think that's pretty brave.

66
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:49,189
Did you lose something?

67
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,625
Yeah, my mom's bracelet.

68
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:00,995
Lana, I know you're busy with
the move and everything...

69
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:05,232
...but I was wondering if you'd
wanna have dinner with me...tonight?

70
00:08:08,912 --> 00:08:11,312
I don't know if that's
such a great idea, Clark.

71
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:17,684
There's something I should've told you.

72
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:19,584
I should've told you a long time ago.

73
00:08:20,557 --> 00:08:24,653
-ls everything okay?
-I hope it will be.

74
00:08:30,734 --> 00:08:34,067
Yeah, of course.
Of course I'll be there.

75
00:08:42,012 --> 00:08:45,413
This is Emily 1 1 months ago.

76
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:49,518
This is Emily now.

77
00:08:53,223 --> 00:08:54,952
She looks just like her mother.

78
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,788
Yeah, well, I bet her mother can't
move through a brick wall.

79
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:02,398
She didn't go out the door, Mr. Dinsmore,
she went through the door.

80
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:05,633
You created her, how'd she do it?

81
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:10,696
That means her molecules are vibrating so
fast, they can be absorbed through matter.

82
00:09:10,874 --> 00:09:16,369
Well, that's a little detail that my
ex-project director failed to discover.

83
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,816
Where do you think she's going,
Mr. Dinsmore?

84
00:09:22,553 --> 00:09:26,455
Last time she left, she went straight to
her best childhood friend.

85
00:09:26,623 --> 00:09:30,184
Yes, Lana Lang. And that meeting ended
with Miss Lang near death...

86
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,591
-...at the bottom of a river.
-You can't blame her for that.

87
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:37,165
No matter what age Emily appears to be,
her emotional development...

88
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:39,700
-...is that of a child.
-Well, she's not a child.

89
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,499
She's a failed experiment
and a colossal liability.

90
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:52,013
Mr. Dinsmore, it is imperative
that I find her before anyone else.

91
00:09:55,352 --> 00:09:57,513
All right, I'm gonna do one
of two things.

92
00:09:57,688 --> 00:10:01,784
I'm gonna either send out a team that will
do whatever it takes to retrieve her...

93
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:05,520
...or I will send you...

94
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,459
...her father.

95
00:10:12,202 --> 00:10:15,228
Well, I guess you're not gonna
miss the 5 a.m. pastry deliveries.

96
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:18,897
It's weird. All I was trying to do
was save this place from being torn down.

97
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,512
Next thing I know,
it kind of took over my life.

98
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,340
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

99
00:10:24,515 --> 00:10:27,541
I thought they were turning the Talon
into a house of heartburn.

100
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:30,243
Why would I do that?

101
00:10:35,058 --> 00:10:36,889
-You must be Lana.
-Yeah.

102
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,652
I thought I was meeting Mr. Kerns.

103
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:43,529
-He's my dad.
-Oh, I didn't realize.

104
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,361
He sent me to set everything up.

105
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:48,164
-I'm Emma.
-Hi.

106
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:54,675
Have we met before?
You seem really familiar.

107
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:57,307
Everybody says that.

108
00:10:57,981 --> 00:11:01,417
This is Chloe. She'll be one of your
frequent "caffeinators."

109
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:04,053
-Hi.
-Hi.

110
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:08,089
Just out of curiosity, what's going on
with the burrito bar?

111
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:09,623
Oh, it was all wrong.

112
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:12,921
Everything-- It's perfect just the way it is.

113
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:18,257
Lana, would you mind staying around a
little while and showing me the ropes?

114
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:20,027
No, no. It's the least I could do.

115
00:11:21,572 --> 00:11:24,063
Oh, and I wanted to give you these.

116
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:26,004
Found an extra set of keys.

117
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:29,873
I sort of feel like I'm handing over
half of my life to you.

118
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,543
Don't worry, it's in good hands.

119
00:11:43,293 --> 00:11:45,557
-Hi.
-Hey, Mom.

120
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:52,769
Does this mean I'm off the hook
for dinner?

121
00:11:52,936 --> 00:11:54,301
I invited Lana over.

122
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:57,572
It must be hard to say goodbye.

123
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:02,745
Well, if this works, I won't have to.

124
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,578
Do you think it's fair
to keep doing this to her?

125
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,208
No. That's why I've decided
to tell her tonight.

126
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:13,318
Tell her?

127
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,681
Everything.

128
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:17,417
Clark...

129
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:22,191
...asking someone to keep your
secret is a big responsibility, you know.

130
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,891
-Look at Pete. It hasn't been easy for him.
-I know.

131
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:27,161
And Pete has had some close calls.

132
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:29,396
But I'm still glad I told him and so is he.

133
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:31,803
It's made us better friends.

134
00:12:32,943 --> 00:12:36,902
-Are you sure Lana's ready?
-She keeps asking me to be honest.

135
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,275
I owe her the chance
to decide for herself.

136
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:45,185
I guess it's not fair to raise you
as one of us...

137
00:12:45,355 --> 00:12:50,452
...and then try to keep you from
experiencing one of the best parts of life.

138
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:52,957
So you're okay with this?

139
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:57,223
I trust you to make your own decision.

140
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:03,696
I told you about the delivery truck, right?

141
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:06,274
-Tuesday mornings at 6.
-Yeah.

142
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:12,715
Well, I guess that's everything.

143
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:15,283
It was fun having you around today.

144
00:13:15,452 --> 00:13:19,388
Are you sure you want to leave all this?
I mean, everything you know is here.

145
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:24,591
Yeah, well, you know,
that's exactly why I need to go.

146
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:28,390
That's too bad.
I thought we could've been friends.

147
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,365
Maybe even best friends.

148
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:38,974
Well, I'm sorry we won't get a chance
to know each other better.

149
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:40,473
We already do, silly.

150
00:13:42,312 --> 00:13:43,870
I'll show you.

151
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:52,980
-Mr. Dinsmore?
-ls she here?

152
00:13:53,523 --> 00:13:55,923
-Who?
-Emily.

153
00:13:59,863 --> 00:14:01,262
Oh, my God.

154
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:05,399
I knew she would come to you, Lana.
I have to get her back to LuthorCorp.

155
00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:08,037
-You know how dangerous she is.
-What does she want?

156
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,379
You have to forgive me.

157
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:21,784
I forgave you.
That's what friends do.

158
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:40,098
I'm sorry, Lana.

159
00:15:13,003 --> 00:15:15,062
Emily!

160
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:26,273
Help! Help me! Somebody help me!

161
00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:30,044
Emily!

162
00:15:31,922 --> 00:15:35,153
Help! Help!

163
00:15:48,305 --> 00:15:52,867
That's not exactly the face of someone who
just secured another government contract.

164
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:58,172
-Everything okay?
-Fine. Everything is just...

165
00:15:58,348 --> 00:15:59,747
...fine.

166
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,543
I...

167
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:05,086
...asked you here because l....

168
00:16:06,156 --> 00:16:08,249
I need your help, son.

169
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:12,755
I have an executive
who has proven himself...

170
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:16,296
...in so many ways,
and I want to reward his efforts...

171
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:19,993
...or his accomplishments with a--

172
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,798
I don't know, a promotion.

173
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:24,771
I'm missing the dilemma.

174
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:29,139
The dilemma is that I have a feeling
he's not trustworthy.

175
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:32,672
What would you do
if you were in my shoes?

176
00:16:32,849 --> 00:16:37,286
Would you give him a chance
to fess up?

177
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:42,087
To confess to any disloyal behavior
he's guilty of?

178
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:46,953
Maybe the same ruthless qualities
that make you question his trust...

179
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,327
...would make him a valuable asset
when it comes to running a company.

180
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,024
Or maybe they'd...

181
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:54,102
...just make him...

182
00:16:57,407 --> 00:16:59,534
...a disloyal son.

183
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,340
-Dad.
-You betrayed me, your own father.

184
00:17:03,513 --> 00:17:05,640
I protected myself,
just like you taught me to.

185
00:17:05,815 --> 00:17:10,718
Lex, whatever problems we have, keep them
within the walls of our own house.

186
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:14,323
-Don't stoop to this level.
-Spare me the lecture, Dad.

187
00:17:16,726 --> 00:17:21,220
I had nothing to do with the murders of
Dr. Teng and her team at the Metron lab.

188
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:25,297
You sold me out to the cops
for your inexplicable blood experiments.

189
00:17:25,468 --> 00:17:29,029
-I did it to make you stronger.
-The hell you did!

190
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:31,966
You can't hide every deceitful thing
you've done to me...

191
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:34,576
...under the guise of mentorship!

192
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:37,770
You brought this on yourself.

193
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,141
You've gotten careless.

194
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,014
Why is that, Dad?

195
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:48,146
Why would you risk everything
on all these obscure projects?

196
00:17:50,126 --> 00:17:51,957
What could be that important?

197
00:17:52,128 --> 00:17:57,589
If you had given me any reason
to trust you...

198
00:17:58,835 --> 00:18:00,860
...you wouldn't have to ask that question.

199
00:18:03,406 --> 00:18:04,896
Get out.

200
00:18:20,957 --> 00:18:23,653
-What?
-Yeah, it's Loder.

201
00:18:24,027 --> 00:18:25,756
Your kid hasn't found anything.

202
00:18:26,363 --> 00:18:29,594
If he does, believe me,
I'll make sure it stays buried.

203
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:31,632
Good.

204
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:33,866
And our other...

205
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:38,366
-...situation?
-I'm looking into the Ross kid.

206
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,769
All right.

207
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:43,609
-Go talk to him.
-I'm working on it.

208
00:19:04,901 --> 00:19:06,994
Your mother told me you were up here.

209
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:11,737
Don't worry, Dad. Lana stood me up.
The secret's still safe.

210
00:19:13,076 --> 00:19:14,737
You know...

211
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:18,813
...there could be 1 00 different reasons
why Lana didn't show up here tonight.

212
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:22,213
None of them might have anything
to do with you.

213
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:26,347
I've given Lana so many reasons
not to trust me.

214
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,952
But I'm not gonna give up.

215
00:19:30,393 --> 00:19:32,918
There's no way I can talk you
out of this, right?

216
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:45,199
Clark, sometimes a person can hold on
too tight for too long.

217
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,469
Dad, I've liked Lana since the first time
I saw her. You know that.

218
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:52,081
-It's not gonna change.
-I'm not talking about you.

219
00:19:52,248 --> 00:19:54,409
I'm talking about me.

220
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:59,146
You see, a father is supposed to
help his son build a life...

221
00:20:00,623 --> 00:20:02,454
...not try to hold him back from one.

222
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:07,858
-But you still think it's a bad idea?
-Yeah, I do.

223
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:13,695
But honestly, Clark, I don't trust
my instincts the way I used to.

224
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:18,473
I just hope you can trust yours.

225
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,157
-Excuse me.
-Can I help you?

226
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:44,164
-I'm Clark Kent. I'm a friend of Lana's.
-Then the first cup of coffee is free.

227
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:46,325
Actually, I'm just looking for her.

228
00:20:46,503 --> 00:20:50,166
She was supposed to meet me last night.
Chloe said the last time she saw her...

229
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,436
-...she was here with you.
-Oh. She didn't tell you?

230
00:20:55,311 --> 00:20:57,108
Lana's gone.

231
00:20:57,413 --> 00:20:59,574
She already left for Paris.

232
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,010
She wasn't supposed to leave
for two more days.

233
00:21:02,185 --> 00:21:05,177
-Maybe she changed her mind.
-She wouldn't just leave like that.

234
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:07,380
Not without saying goodbye to anyone.

235
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:11,721
I heard her say something
about hating goodbyes.

236
00:21:35,652 --> 00:21:37,950
I made us TV dinners.

237
00:21:39,956 --> 00:21:43,221
They're our favorite, with the brownie.

238
00:21:45,128 --> 00:21:49,292
Emily, I'm sure that you've been
through a lot...

239
00:21:49,465 --> 00:21:52,593
...and I know that you're
probably very lonely.

240
00:21:53,002 --> 00:21:56,096
But we can still be friends
without you keeping me in here.

241
00:21:56,272 --> 00:21:58,433
How can we be best friends
if you go away?

242
00:22:00,543 --> 00:22:02,704
We'll write each other letters.

243
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:04,676
You know, and you can come visit me.

244
00:22:04,848 --> 00:22:07,408
-Wouldn't you like to see Paris?
-No.

245
00:22:07,584 --> 00:22:09,609
I don't want you to go either.

246
00:22:09,853 --> 00:22:12,219
Things are better this way.
You'll see.

247
00:22:12,388 --> 00:22:16,017
We'll have so much fun.
And then, one day, if you're good...

248
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:17,989
...we can run the Talon together.

249
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:21,587
Emily...

250
00:22:22,665 --> 00:22:26,829
...you can't just force someone
to be your friend.

251
00:22:27,003 --> 00:22:30,336
It's something that happens over time
when you trust each other.

252
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:32,872
I know what a friend is.

253
00:22:33,243 --> 00:22:38,408
A friend is someone who would
stand up for you and protect you.

254
00:22:38,581 --> 00:22:43,177
A friend is someone who would jump in
a river to save you from drowning...

255
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,750
...even if it meant they had to give up
their own life for you.

256
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,186
You don't need to tell me...

257
00:22:51,427 --> 00:22:53,952
...what it means to be a friend.

258
00:22:54,597 --> 00:23:00,502
Then you know that a friend would
never keep me locked up in here.

259
00:23:01,437 --> 00:23:02,699
Get used to it.

260
00:23:03,306 --> 00:23:04,568
I did.

261
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:14,313
People are going to come looking for me.

262
00:23:15,184 --> 00:23:16,583
No.

263
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:18,852
They won't.

264
00:23:22,992 --> 00:23:24,983
They think you already went to Paris.

265
00:23:39,342 --> 00:23:41,606
My father found the wire, Clark.

266
00:23:41,778 --> 00:23:45,077
The FBl's dropping the case unless
I can find something incriminating.

267
00:23:45,248 --> 00:23:48,149
With everything your father's done,
that shouldn't be too hard.

268
00:23:48,318 --> 00:23:51,617
Well, my father's sort of mastered the art
of covering his tracks.

269
00:23:51,788 --> 00:23:54,018
You wouldn't know anything about that,
would you?

270
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,522
You mean like hiding things
from your best friend?

271
00:23:56,693 --> 00:23:58,251
You tell me, Lex.

272
00:23:58,428 --> 00:23:59,952
Look, I'm a little under the gun.

273
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:02,597
If I upset you,
you're gonna have to be more specific.

274
00:24:02,765 --> 00:24:05,598
Lana's ticket.
Why didn't you tell me you changed it?

275
00:24:05,768 --> 00:24:07,861
Well, I didn't think
I needed your permission.

276
00:24:08,037 --> 00:24:10,631
If anything, I thought I was buying
you more time.

277
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:13,935
It's an open-ended ticket
so she can leave whenever she wants.

278
00:24:16,946 --> 00:24:20,905
-So she didn't say goodbye to you, either?
-What's going on?

279
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,416
According to the daughter of
the new Talon owner...

280
00:24:23,586 --> 00:24:25,986
..."whenever she wants" was today.

281
00:24:26,823 --> 00:24:28,381
Lana's gone.

282
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,858
Clark, the new owner
doesn't have a daughter.

283
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:49,272
Sorry, we're closed.

284
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:50,912
Why did you tell me Lana left?

285
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,277
My friend pulled some strings and checked.
She never got on any plane.

286
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:58,318
Like you care. You weren't a very good
friend if you were gonna let her go away.

287
00:24:58,488 --> 00:25:02,618
-What did you do to her?
-She doesn't need you anymore.

288
00:25:02,825 --> 00:25:04,486
You tell me where she is.

289
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,494
You were nicer to me when I was little.
You told me you were different too.

290
00:25:08,664 --> 00:25:12,657
So you know what it's like
to be left alone without anybody.

291
00:25:30,253 --> 00:25:32,278
Good evening, Miss Sullivan.

292
00:25:33,923 --> 00:25:36,824
Just when you thought it was safe
to go back into the hallways.

293
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,723
All right, you can cut the sarcasm.

294
00:25:39,896 --> 00:25:42,364
I'm only here because I need your help.

295
00:25:43,132 --> 00:25:47,296
With all your resources, Mr. Luthor,
what could you possibly want from me?

296
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,994
Your friendship...

297
00:25:51,107 --> 00:25:52,438
...with Lana Lang.

298
00:25:52,608 --> 00:25:56,806
A young woman in my care,
daughter of a friend, is missing.

299
00:25:56,979 --> 00:26:00,380
-We can't locate her.
-I'll congratulate her when I see her.

300
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,541
I don't know what this has
to do with Lana--

301
00:26:02,718 --> 00:26:06,484
Her father was looking for her.
He's disappeared as well.

302
00:26:06,756 --> 00:26:11,659
She was Lana's best friend
when they were children.

303
00:26:11,828 --> 00:26:14,991
So it's possible she might show up
here in Smallville.

304
00:26:15,465 --> 00:26:17,797
The girl is sick.

305
00:26:18,835 --> 00:26:22,430
Very sick. She needs treatment.

306
00:26:22,605 --> 00:26:26,371
If she's here in Smallville,
I'm sure you'll find out about it.

307
00:26:27,143 --> 00:26:29,338
I'll expect a call from you.

308
00:26:50,867 --> 00:26:54,860
Lana, your tea's gonna get cold.

309
00:27:05,214 --> 00:27:07,409
Would you like some more tea, Emily?

310
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,775
You're not my friend anymore.

311
00:27:48,257 --> 00:27:49,690
It's Emily Dinsmore.

312
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:52,589
They found her father's car
abandoned outside the Talon.

313
00:27:52,762 --> 00:27:56,129
Lionel must've nabbed her last year
after she pushed Lana off the bridge.

314
00:27:56,299 --> 00:28:00,201
And in the meantime, she's picked up
a bad habit of walking through walls.

315
00:28:00,369 --> 00:28:04,533
We know why Lionel's trying so hard to
get her back. He can't let Lex find her first.

316
00:28:04,774 --> 00:28:07,402
Wait a minute, when did Lex
enter the equation?

317
00:28:08,177 --> 00:28:12,079
Chloe, Lex has been working with the FBl
to try and take down his father.

318
00:28:12,715 --> 00:28:16,116
If you knew Lex was looking for dirt
on Lionel, why didn't you tell him...

319
00:28:16,285 --> 00:28:18,753
-...about his grandparents?
-We never had evidence...

320
00:28:18,921 --> 00:28:22,857
...about what Lionel was doing. Besides,
the last time Lex confronted him about it...

321
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:24,686
...it almost got him killed.

322
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:30,559
But if we found Emily, then we could prove
that Lionel has been illegally cloning people.

323
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:33,634
What I don't get is if Emily
could've escaped at any time...

324
00:28:33,803 --> 00:28:36,294
...why wait till now for the
sudden encore appearance?

325
00:28:36,472 --> 00:28:39,270
Maybe she found out
she was gonna lose Lana forever.

326
00:28:39,575 --> 00:28:43,136
Then the question is, what would you do
to keep someone from leaving?

327
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,305
Try to make things go back
to the way they were before.

328
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:50,508
You mean when they were kids?

329
00:28:51,053 --> 00:28:53,146
Emily still thinks Lana's her best friend...

330
00:28:53,322 --> 00:28:55,882
...and everything can be like
when they played together.

331
00:28:56,058 --> 00:28:58,322
You lived next door to Lana,
do you remember them?

332
00:28:58,494 --> 00:29:00,826
No, they spent most of their time
at Emily's.

333
00:29:00,997 --> 00:29:03,761
What we need to do is figure out
where that is.

334
00:29:09,272 --> 00:29:11,832
-Goodbye, Lana.
-Emily, please don't do this.

335
00:29:12,008 --> 00:29:13,635
Emily, please!

336
00:29:53,983 --> 00:29:55,610
Lana.

337
00:29:57,787 --> 00:29:59,414
Clark.

338
00:31:11,627 --> 00:31:13,219
-Was I speeding?
-No, kid.

339
00:31:13,396 --> 00:31:16,126
But I'm gonna have to ask you
to step out of the car.

340
00:31:17,199 --> 00:31:21,226
FBl. I just have a few questions for you.
It won't take long.

341
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,571
-I'm pretty sure you got the wrong guy.
-You Pete Ross?

342
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,968
Is this about my mom?

343
00:31:26,142 --> 00:31:29,043
Federal judges gotta go through
a routine security check.

344
00:31:29,211 --> 00:31:31,145
I just got a few questions to ask you.

345
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:36,882
So you have information that could
put my father in prison.

346
00:31:37,052 --> 00:31:41,216
So did you, before you obliterated those
seven weeks of your memory at Belle Reve.

347
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,587
-Do you know what he was trying to hide?
-Lex...

348
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:49,094
...your father murdered his parents
in a tenement fire.

349
00:31:49,265 --> 00:31:52,757
He hired a crime lord named Morgan Edge
to do the dirty work.

350
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:58,534
You got Edge's confession on videotape,
but Daddy Dearest destroyed it.

351
00:31:59,608 --> 00:32:01,769
Then there's no proof.

352
00:32:04,146 --> 00:32:08,139
Only the voice mail confession
of Lionel Luthor himself.

353
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,785
He tried to scrub it, but erased voice
mail's like deleted computer files.

354
00:32:11,954 --> 00:32:14,354
Someone with enough pull
and the right password...

355
00:32:14,523 --> 00:32:16,548
...can resurrect them
from the cyber graveyard.

356
00:32:16,725 --> 00:32:19,285
-Why didn't you come to me sooner?
-Your psychiatrist...

357
00:32:19,462 --> 00:32:22,522
...didn't accidentally wrap her car
around a tree. You showed me...

358
00:32:22,698 --> 00:32:25,531
...the investigator's body
on a slab in the morgue.

359
00:32:25,701 --> 00:32:28,192
Luthor family politics can get
a little grim.

360
00:32:29,438 --> 00:32:30,996
Chloe...

361
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:36,574
...it means a lot you're willing
to do this for me...

362
00:32:36,745 --> 00:32:42,308
...but if you come forward, you're putting
yourself between my father and the FBl.

363
00:32:42,918 --> 00:32:45,250
That's not a very safe place to be.

364
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:48,313
I know.

365
00:32:49,024 --> 00:32:52,585
But I can't get out from under
your father's grip by myself.

366
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:56,424
Besides, I know you won't
let anything happen to me.

367
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,398
Get up!

368
00:33:03,873 --> 00:33:07,502
-You know how to swim, Pete?
-Get off me, man.

369
00:33:07,676 --> 00:33:11,407
-What are you doing?
-I'm losing my patience with you.

370
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,582
You're crazy.

371
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:18,179
-I don't know anything about a secret.
-You're just his best friend.

372
00:33:19,255 --> 00:33:22,156
You know, you can continue
to play the hero if you want...

373
00:33:22,324 --> 00:33:24,849
...but are the skeletons in his closet
worth your life?

374
00:33:25,027 --> 00:33:26,858
I'm not telling you anything.

375
00:33:27,696 --> 00:33:30,665
-Oh, I think you will.
-Loder!

376
00:33:33,168 --> 00:33:36,467
-Pete, you okay?
-You're the one who's got him after Clark?

377
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,971
No. But I have a feeling my father did.

378
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:43,339
Didn't he? He found out you were
working with me and paid you off.

379
00:33:43,512 --> 00:33:46,481
No wonder you were so anxious
to drop the case against him.

380
00:33:47,016 --> 00:33:51,680
I really don't want a morality lesson from
someone willing to rat out their own father.

381
00:33:52,421 --> 00:33:55,117
So how much did he toss in
to do leg work on Clark?

382
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:58,021
If I was you, I'd be worried
less about this farm kid...

383
00:33:58,193 --> 00:34:00,684
...and more about the homicide charges
you'll face...

384
00:34:00,863 --> 00:34:05,232
-...when I throw you to Metropolis P.D.
-Somehow I'm not too concerned.

385
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:08,268
I bet your supervisors would be
very interested...

386
00:34:08,437 --> 00:34:11,895
...to know about your
unique interrogation methods.

387
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:14,174
What is it you want, Luthor?

388
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:17,403
I want you to get back to the case
you were assigned.

389
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:22,212
That's all the evidence you'll need
on my father.

390
00:34:30,259 --> 00:34:33,023
You're making a mistake, Lex.

391
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:39,662
This kid is sitting on something
bigger than you...

392
00:34:40,936 --> 00:34:42,995
...or even your dad.

393
00:34:43,172 --> 00:34:45,333
Isn't that right, Pete?

394
00:34:54,817 --> 00:34:56,751
You sure you're all right?

395
00:34:59,221 --> 00:35:03,453
Clark was probably right
confiding in you instead of me.

396
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:05,924
Couldn't ask for a better friend.

397
00:35:06,996 --> 00:35:08,725
Come on.

398
00:35:09,465 --> 00:35:11,262
I thought that guy was gonna kill me.

399
00:35:11,433 --> 00:35:13,560
I guess I owe you a thanks.

400
00:35:14,436 --> 00:35:17,997
I'm sure when the time comes
you'll do the same for me.

401
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,677
Hey, Pete.

402
00:35:32,388 --> 00:35:35,880
-What happened to you?
-FBl agent decided to go off payroll.

403
00:35:36,058 --> 00:35:37,855
Wanted to know about you.

404
00:35:38,027 --> 00:35:40,052
Don't worry.
I didn't tell him anything.

405
00:35:40,796 --> 00:35:42,661
-I should've been there.
-That's just it.

406
00:35:42,831 --> 00:35:47,063
You can't always be there.
I gotta look out for myself.

407
00:35:49,071 --> 00:35:51,767
I just thought you should know
they're onto you.

408
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:57,274
-Thanks for the warning.
-The FBl isn't who I'm warning you about.

409
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,580
Lex was there.

410
00:35:59,748 --> 00:36:02,012
He's the one who pulled the fed off me.

411
00:36:02,885 --> 00:36:07,151
-He's investigating his father, not me.
-That doesn't matter. He knows.

412
00:36:07,322 --> 00:36:09,654
Now, I'm not exactly sure how much...

413
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:12,521
...but he's not gonna stop
until he's got everything.

414
00:36:13,328 --> 00:36:15,455
Clark, you gotta keep an eye on him.

415
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:17,594
Look out for yourself.

416
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,560
Pete?

417
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,463
Why are you talking like that?

418
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:30,334
-I'm moving to Wichita with my mom.
-No, Pete.

419
00:36:30,546 --> 00:36:32,411
I thought that--

420
00:36:33,148 --> 00:36:34,877
What about senior year?

421
00:36:38,721 --> 00:36:41,781
No, Pete, you can't do this because of me.

422
00:36:41,957 --> 00:36:44,949
I know that I told you
keeping your secret wasn't hard...

423
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:49,654
...but I lied. I walk around every day,
afraid that I'm gonna slip up.

424
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:53,199
-Well, why didn't you tell me sooner?
-Because you needed a friend.

425
00:36:53,368 --> 00:36:55,165
And so did l.

426
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,641
You don't have to move.
You don't have to change your whole life.

427
00:36:59,808 --> 00:37:02,106
There must be a way.
No one has to know we're friends.

428
00:37:02,277 --> 00:37:04,837
There's a lot of things that
I can handle...

429
00:37:05,013 --> 00:37:08,005
...but I could never live with myself
if I betrayed you.

430
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:11,809
Pete.

431
00:37:14,556 --> 00:37:16,524
I'll see you around, Clark.

432
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,085
Hi.

433
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:58,362
-Lana.
-I heard Emily disappeared from Belle Reve...

434
00:37:58,534 --> 00:38:01,935
-...as soon as she was admitted.
-Yeah, even under heavy sedation.

435
00:38:02,404 --> 00:38:05,202
-Do you think she's going to come back?
-No.

436
00:38:05,607 --> 00:38:07,973
I think Lionel Luthor
will make sure of that.

437
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:12,003
Are you okay?

438
00:38:13,148 --> 00:38:15,139
Yeah.

439
00:38:15,551 --> 00:38:17,246
Yeah, I'm fine.

440
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:21,555
I'm just sorry that I ruined dinner.

441
00:38:21,723 --> 00:38:24,624
That's okay. I'm sure I've racked up
more than a few lOUs.

442
00:38:24,793 --> 00:38:28,058
Well, I was really looking forward to it.

443
00:38:28,397 --> 00:38:30,160
So was l.

444
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:36,630
So there's something that
you wanted to tell me.

445
00:38:37,172 --> 00:38:38,571
What is it?

446
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:44,208
I just wanted to tell you that....

447
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,395
Have a great time in Paris.

448
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:04,231
I hope you find what you're looking for.

449
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:14,532
Goodbye, Clark.

450
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,363
Forgive them, for they know not
what they do.

451
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:13,899
Is that what you expect from me,
forgiveness?

452
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:17,698
Don't try to make me out
as your own personal Judas.

453
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,341
I didn't come here for forgiveness.

454
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:24,609
I came here to congratulate you on
sweeping another mishap under the rug.

455
00:40:26,281 --> 00:40:30,615
-Emily Dinsmore?
-Oh, yes. Emily Dinsmore.

456
00:40:32,487 --> 00:40:37,447
I should have remembered.
You should have warned them.

457
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:40,527
Belle Reve has a habit of...

458
00:40:40,929 --> 00:40:44,330
...misplacing its patients. The details--

459
00:40:44,499 --> 00:40:46,729
I've always tried to teach you, Lex.

460
00:40:47,169 --> 00:40:49,535
The devil is in the details.

461
00:40:49,705 --> 00:40:53,072
If you don't pay attention
to the details...

462
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:54,937
...he'll win.

463
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,738
Then it's a good thing I'm a fast learner.

464
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:03,010
You went through all the trouble of having
your own son committed to an asylum...

465
00:41:03,185 --> 00:41:06,450
...and shooting 600 volts of electricity
through his body...

466
00:41:06,621 --> 00:41:08,782
...just to cover up your trespasses.

467
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:13,751
But like I said, Dad,
you've gotten careless.

468
00:41:19,868 --> 00:41:23,304
Loder, why are you here?

469
00:41:23,805 --> 00:41:26,501
Lionel Luthor, you're under arrest.

470
00:41:28,844 --> 00:41:30,937
On what charge?

471
00:41:32,147 --> 00:41:36,880
The murder of your parents,
Lachlan and Eliza Luthor.

472
00:41:43,658 --> 00:41:45,285
Let's go.

473
00:41:49,297 --> 00:41:52,130
Be careful, son. Don't forget.

474
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,360
Judas hung himself with his own rope.

475
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,000
