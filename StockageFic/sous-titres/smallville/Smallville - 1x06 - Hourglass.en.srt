1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,160
We need an orderly to room 206.
Orderly please to room 206.

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,840
Man, I don't know how
I let you talk me into this.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,880
Every student needs to complete
30 hours of community service.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,800
Yeah. But we could have served
our community by life guarding...

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,240
...a girls' swim class instead of
hanging out with the denture crowd.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,000
I mean, what's the attraction?

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,720
Hi, Clark, Pete.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,040
Lana, I didn't know
you were volunteering here.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,920
- Yeah, right.
- For a couple of weeks now.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,040
- You part of the companion program?
- I'm reading with Cassandra.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,040
She's an interesting woman. Some of
the nurses say she can see the future.

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,640
It takes two of you
to read to me now, does it?

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,520
Don't just stand there, come in.

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,280
- How'd you know there were two of us?
- Well, I'm blind, not deaf.

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,080
I heard your little friend's shoes
squeaking all the way down the hall.

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,080
Can you really tell the future?

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,800
- Way to go, Pete, real subtle.
- What's your name?

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,560
Pete Ross.

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,400
Mr. Ross, if you want your
fortune told go to the circus.

20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,320
It's a long walk home, Mr. Ross.
Check your pockets.

21
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,400
Oh, man. I locked my keys in the car.

22
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,360
Dude, you're on your own.

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,160
Now, what's your name?

24
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,320
Mr. Bollston? It's Lana Lang.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,920
Lang.

26
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,360
The Langs moved to Smallville in 1938...

27
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,240
...took over
a couple of Dust Bowl farms.

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
Knew a bargain when they saw it.

29
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,360
- You're a local-history buff.
- It's kind of my obsession.

30
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,640
So...

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,440
Are you my next victim?

32
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,200
You don't look that scary to me.

33
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,320
You should have known me
in my younger days.

34
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,640
I'm sure you were
quite the heartbreaker.

35
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,560
How about a spin around the grounds
and you can tell me...

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,720
...what the Langs have been doing
since 1938.

37
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,000
It's so beautiful. I don't know why
more people don't come out here.

38
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,200
They're too busy watching television.

39
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,520
Say, would you mind running back
to my room and getting me a scarf?

40
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,640
- I don't want to catch a chill.
- Sure.

41
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,240
Honey, you're a doll.

42
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,480
Water, please.

43
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,120
What's wrong?

44
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,640
Someone close to you is going to die.

45
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,120
Very soon.

46
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,640
Hourglass

47
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,560
When you need this kind of stuff done,
ask me. That's why I'm here.

48
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,840
- Something bothering you, Clark?
- I think we should be putting safety first.

49
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,200
If you haven't noticed,
this stuff is dangerous.

50
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,400
Yeah, well, this is a farm.
It kind of goes along with the territory.

51
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,200
Seriously, son, what's going on?

52
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,200
At the retirement center
I met this old, blind lady.

53
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,720
I know it sounds crazy,
but she can see the future.

54
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,240
What did she tell you?

55
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,680
That someone very close to me
will die soon.

56
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,600
Listen, Clark. You can't let some old lady
scare you with a half-baked prediction.

57
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,560
I mean, she probably just does it
to scare the nurses anyway.

58
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,960
She told Pete he'd be walking home,
seconds later...

59
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,400
...he realized that he
locked his keys in his car.

60
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,240
No one can tell the future.

61
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,760
What if she can? What if she told me
because I can do something about it?

62
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,080
Then she should have given you
more information: Name, time, place.

63
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,240
Yeah, and even if she can predict the
future, she can't control it. Nobody can.

64
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,920
Fate's given you a second chance,
Harry boy.

65
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,160
And this time...

66
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,480
...they're gonna pay.

67
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,560
Order up.

68
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,840
I haven't been able to eat one of these
in years. I mean, not since the bypass.

69
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,160
- That was a joke.
- You're a riot.

70
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,840
What can I get you to drink?

71
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,920
How much is coffee?
From, you know, beans?

72
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,360
$2.75.

73
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,160
They carry it from
South America by foot?

74
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,040
- You sound like my grandpa.
- Just make sure it's hot.

75
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,880
Yep. Whatever.

76
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,400
It's not your fault, Lana.

77
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,880
Do you know anyone else who's lost
an entire old person in a wheelchair?

78
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,160
Nope, that's pretty impressive,
even by Smallville standards.

79
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,640
Maybe he was kidnapped.

80
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,560
Who'd want to kidnap Harry?
He's just a harmless old man.

81
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,200
Maybe a koi turned into a piranha
and ate him.

82
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,360
You asked for my help.
I'm just thinking out of the box.

83
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,680
I like your theory.

84
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,400
You might want to work on
your eavesdropping technique.

85
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,880
Sorry. I'm new in town. I just heard
this is where young people congregate.

86
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,800
Yeah, we congregate here often.

87
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,720
Hi, I'm Clark.
The rude one's Chloe, and this is...

88
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,760
Lana Lang.

89
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,240
Nametag was a big clue.

90
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,840
So good luck finding
your missing old person.

91
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,880
Enjoy your coffee.
They brought it in by burro this morning.

92
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,520
Thanks, honey. You're a doll.

93
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,800
You play beautifully.

94
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,600
I was supposed to attend
the Metropolis Conservatory.

95
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,960
Your voice sounds young.

96
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,640
The conservatory
closed its doors in the '70s.

97
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,920
I mean, I've always dreamed of attending
there. If I'd lived in a different time.

98
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,080
Any chance you could give an old lady
a hand back to her room?

99
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,480
I already know my future.

100
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,160
You might consider
rounding those curves...

101
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,080
...at a speed that won't break
the sound barrier.

102
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,160
- Where's the fun in that?
- Seriously. You could get hurt.

103
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Why the sudden interest in my health?

104
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,200
I met a woman at the retirement center,
and she can kind of see the future.

105
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,920
- She tell you your future?
- Not exactly.

106
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,240
She said someone
very close to me would...

107
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,560
- Die?
- I know it sounds nuts...

108
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,200
...but when you talk to her,
it's like she really knows.

109
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,560
Clark, she knows when
she has a good audience.

110
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,720
- You sound like my parents.
- That's gotta be a first.

111
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,280
Lex, I think this woman is the real deal.

112
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,440
Well, then the question
you gotta ask yourself is:

113
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,120
Do you really want to know the future?

114
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,320
Don't you wish you knew
how it was all gonna turn out?

115
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,400
Life's a journey. I don't want to
go through it following a road map.

116
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,560
It still wouldn't kill you
to drive more slowly.

117
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,720
Why? I have you as a friend.
You changed my future once, right?

118
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,560
Got some more deliveries to make.

119
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,040
- You never told me this woman's name.
- Thought you weren't interested.

120
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,920
Maybe I'll ask her for some stock tips.

121
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,400
Cassandra Carver.

122
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,600
I don't think that's
gonna help bring Harry back.

123
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,560
Clark, what are you doing here so late?

124
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,320
I came to see Cassandra, if she's still up.

125
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,400
What happened to
Harry's younger picture?

126
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,920
I don't know.

127
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,200
Is everything okay?

128
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,080
I met with the administrator, you know,
to tell them what I knew about Harry.

129
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,360
The police were there.

130
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,080
Well, it's a missing person case.
It's not unusual.

131
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,440
That's not the reason.
Harry Bollston's real name is Harry Volk.

132
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,400
He was a murderer, Clark.

133
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,400
A murderer? Why would they let
someone like that stay here?

134
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,800
Because it happened 60 years ago,
when he was 17. He served his time.

135
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,840
They figured he was
a harmless old man...

136
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,880
...who moved back
to his hometown to die.

137
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,360
Back in the '40s he was studying to be
a concert pianist. He was up...

138
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,480
...for a full scholarship
to the Metropolis Conservatory.

139
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,560
But his teacher recommended
somebody else.

140
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,320
So he killed his teacher?

141
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,800
No. He said the teacher killed his dream,
so he killed the teacher's dream.

142
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,240
The man's son.

143
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,480
He's got three on the clock,
he'd better hurry.

144
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:08,480
Throw the ball! Throw the ball!
Watch the blitz! Yes! Yes!

145
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,800
You got it!

146
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,880
Damn it. Circuit breaker.

147
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,600
Evening. Sorry about the trouble. We got
a faulty line about a mile down the road.

148
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,120
I just wanted to make sure your
circuit breaker hadn't been fried.

149
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,240
- Anybody else at home?
- No, I'm divorced.

150
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,080
I saw the name
on the account was Jim Gage.

151
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,840
Any relation to a Randolph Gage?

152
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,200
Well, I'd say so. He was my father.
Passed back in '93.

153
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,920
I remember reading his obituary.

154
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,960
It said he opened the first
car dealership in Smallville.

155
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,920
- In 1935. You got a good memory.
- Thanks. I had a lot of time to kill.

156
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,880
We got three dealerships
in three counties now.

157
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,760
Sounds like your father
left you a bright future.

158
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,480
Are you gonna come in or not, Mr. Kent?

159
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,800
- How do you do that?
- When one sense goes...

160
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,320
...the others get heightened.

161
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,760
I must admit, after yesterday,
I thought I'd never see you again.

162
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,320
Sit.

163
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,080
What you told me
I can't get out of my head.

164
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,760
Imagine how I feel.
When it first started happening...

165
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,120
...I thought it was a curse.

166
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,440
I kept getting snapshots
of things I couldn't control.

167
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,080
- When did they start?
- When I first lost my sight.

168
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,560
It's funny. I woke up
that morning like any other.

169
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,120
Then the meteors came.

170
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:17,240
One hit a field behind my house,
the flash burnt my optic nerves.

171
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,880
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

172
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,200
It's amazing how one moment
can change your life forever.

173
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,760
My friends and family,
they think that you're...

174
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,320
A fraud?

175
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,640
People are afraid of the unknown, Clark.

176
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,320
They only want to know if everything's
gonna turn out all right.

177
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,480
I can't guarantee that.
What I can show you...

178
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,120
...are signposts on your journey.
What you do with them is up to you.

179
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,680
I've got so many questions in my life,
I just want some answers.

180
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,360
Closer.

181
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,760
Now, take my hand.

182
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,200
No.

183
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,120
No!

184
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,240
No!

185
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,840
No.

186
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,880
You saw that too. Clark?

187
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,400
Clark, maybe you were having
some kind of hallucination.

188
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,840
It wasn't a hallucination, it was
a glimpse of the future. My future.

189
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,160
And you saw an endless graveyard.

190
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,200
Like I was the last person on earth.

191
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,360
Look, son, I don't know what
you did or didn't see, but, come on...

192
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,560
...you gotta consider the source.
- Your dad's right.

193
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,240
We don't know anything about her.

194
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,360
I know she lost her vision
in the meteor shower.

195
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,440
And that makes it so that
she can predict the future?

196
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,040
Is it so crazy?
I'm hit by a car and I'm fine...

197
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,520
...I walk through fire
and I'm okay. What's next?

198
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,600
You can't let this one image
consume your whole life.

199
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,760
What if it is my destiny,
to outlive everyone that I love?

200
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,600
I don't wanna be alone.

201
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,200
Clark.

202
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,800
- I don't know what your future holds.
- I think this woman has the answers.

203
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,400
The only person who controls
your destiny is you.

204
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,720
Well, right now I don't feel like
I have control of anything.

205
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,800
Cassandra Carver?

206
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,880
Do those expensive shoes
come with a name?

207
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,120
Lex Luthor.

208
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,400
Of Luthor... Everything Incorporated?

209
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,000
More or less.

210
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:38,280
And what does the saviour of Smallville
want with an old, blind woman?

211
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,080
You seem to have made an impression
on my friend Clark.

212
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,320
So you came to see for yourself.

213
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,800
Clark's not stupid.
If he says you know things...

214
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,160
...there must be something
that made him think that.

215
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,160
What gives me the feeling...

216
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,120
...you're not here for stock tips,
Mr. Luthor?

217
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,320
Please, call me Lex.

218
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,360
I was hoping you could
give me some insight into Clark.

219
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,040
And you call him a friend, do you?

220
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,320
He saved my life,
but he's also a mystery.

221
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,040
Most people are.

222
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,680
That's what makes them interesting.

223
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,040
I'm willing to treat this
as a professional service.

224
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,800
Save your money, Lex.
I can't tell you about Clark...

225
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,560
...even if I wanted to.

226
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,360
I can only tell the future
of the person I touch.

227
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,480
I don't need to know my future.

228
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,400
Why? Because your father already
has it mapped out for you?

229
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,000
I believe we make our own destiny.

230
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,560
And don't you want a glimpse
of what it is you'll make?

231
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,560
Maybe I'll see your friend Clark, or...

232
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,400
Maybe I'll see something else.

233
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,240
Goodbye, Ms. Carver.
It's been enlightening.

234
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,800
Come back again. When you're ready.

235
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Chloe, what...?

236
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,280
She's not back yet.

237
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,480
- Lana, what are you doing here?
- Chloe called me too. She said she had...

238
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,520
...some info on Harry. When I got here,
I started looking around.

239
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,400
Found this.

240
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,920
Chloe calls it the "Wall of Weird."

241
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,480
She believes everything strange
in Smallville...

242
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,640
...started with the meteor shower.

243
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,040
How about you, Clark?
Do you believe that?

244
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,360
Yeah, I guess I do.

245
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,960
Does that include me?

246
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,200
I'm up there with the three-headed calf
and the monster from Crater Lake.

247
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,280
The stuff on this wall
has nothing to do with you.

248
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,640
Remember when you said people
keep their darkest secrets hidden?

249
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,640
Mine's out there for all the world to see.

250
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,160
It's hard when everyone knows
your tragedy. They treat you differently.

251
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,000
Like you're gonna break.

252
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,560
- They just feel bad and wanna help.
- I know. But all they do...

253
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,880
...is remind you of the
most painful moment of your life.

254
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,280
How would that make you feel, Clark?

255
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Like I wish I could go back in time
and erase that moment forever.

256
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,400
I thought high school would be different,
that I could finally start...

257
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,120
...putting it behind me.
But everywhere I go, there it is.

258
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,840
Maybe I should just accept my destiny.

259
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,240
All I'm ever gonna be is a little girl...

260
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,920
...in a fairy-princess costume
who lost her parents.

261
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,520
I don't see you that way.

262
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,560
I know you don't, Clark.

263
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,800
You're the only one who doesn't.

264
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,440
Clark, we got your message.

265
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,080
Hey, where were you?

266
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,480
I thought we were all supposed
to meet at the Torch.

267
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,640
- Sorry. I didn't mean to blow you off.
- Will the lovely Ms. Lang be joining us?

268
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,000
No, I think she had enough weirdness
for one day. What have you got?

269
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,640
Guy was found dead in his house.

270
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,240
He was blindfolded
and strangled with a piano wire.

271
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,600
Which is the same signature
Harry Volk used in 1945.

272
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,080
Sounds like a copycat.

273
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,200
A copycat of a murder that happened
60 years ago, two days after...

274
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,720
...the original killer disappears?
I don't think so.

275
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,600
Harry's in a wheelchair. Not exactly in
prime condition to go on a crime spree.

276
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,240
Well, I found this picture of Harry
from the '40s.

277
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,320
Looks like the kid
we saw in the Beanery.

278
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,280
Maybe he's got
a grandson or something.

279
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,640
Or maybe it's Harry.

280
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,680
I don't think we should start looking
for time machines just yet.

281
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,960
Okay, fine. Where do you think
we should start?

282
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,440
If someone is following
in Harry's footsteps...

283
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,600
...maybe they sent him fan mail.

284
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,720
We close at 9, Mozart.

285
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,920
Your piano needs tuning.

286
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,080
That's because
nobody's played it in years.

287
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,240
- You want to settle up?
- Can I get one more coffee?

288
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,800
Don't you have somewhere to go?

289
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,600
Oh, come on. You can clean up
to the sounds of Chopin.

290
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,160
I guess.

291
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,320
What if someone sees us
searching Harry's room?

292
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,760
- How about we don't get seen?
- Clark, is that you?

293
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,960
Harry's room is down the hallway.
I'll meet you there.

294
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,800
The other night you left in a hurry.

295
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,920
Sit.

296
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,880
I hoped you'd come back.

297
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,080
I'm sorry.

298
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
You saw that...
Whatever it was.

299
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:44,320
I always see them.
The question is, how did you?

300
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:51,160
- I don't know. Wasn't I supposed to?
- Nobody ever has.

301
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,560
- Why me?
- Because we both know...

302
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,800
...you're not like other people.

303
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,120
- Sure I am.
- No, Clark, I've seen you.

304
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,200
Before we ever met.

305
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:14,720
More than once, I've touched people
and I've seen such...

306
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,400
...pain and despair and...

307
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:22,240
But then you were there
and the pain was gone.

308
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,440
I think that's your destiny, Clark.

309
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,160
To help people, to save them
from fear and darkness.

310
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,080
- How?
- Well, that's for you to figure out.

311
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,240
You can fear the future or...

312
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,360
...you can embrace it.

313
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,440
The choice is yours.

314
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,120
- Who are they?
- People who need your help.

315
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,240
How can I help them
if I don't know who they are?

316
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm not a radio.

317
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,760
I don't pick up continuous
transmissions. That's all I have.

318
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,960
I'll figure it out.

319
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,800
Clark. Your secret's safe with me.

320
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,920
You guys have any luck?

321
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,920
No fan mail, just a bunch of old news
clippings from the Smallville Ledger.

322
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,320
Obituaries, articles.

323
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,240
Guy's been obsessed with Smallville
for 50 years.

324
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,800
- Clark, is something wrong?
- It's her.

325
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,840
- It's who?
- I've gotta go.

326
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,120
Thanks for the serenade, but unless
you're sleeping here, which you're not...

327
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,520
...I'm heading out.

328
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,400
What's this?

329
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,600
They don't teach Greek
in school anymore?

330
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,200
It's Euripides. "The sins of the father
are visited on the children."

331
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,920
You play Beethoven
and you speak Greek.

332
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,360
Real cute. What's it got to do with me?

333
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,200
Actually, Zoe Garfield, quite a bit.

334
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:48,280
Your grandmother, Eve Garfield,
she died last year, right?

335
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,040
I was meant for big cities, great
concert halls. That was my destiny.

336
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,720
And your grandmother,
she helped kill that future.

337
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,240
And now...

338
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,560
...I'm gonna kill yours.

339
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,680
- Let her go!
- Don't move, don't move, don't move!

340
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,040
I said, let her go.

341
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,760
Didn't your parents teach you
to respect your elders?

342
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,120
Oh, no!

343
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,040
Take care of her.

344
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,000
Zoe's gonna be okay, but that
truck driver could have sworn he hit you.

345
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,600
- Don't worry, he's not asking questions.
- Is that kid in jail?

346
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,200
No, he's in the hospital
overnight for observation.

347
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,080
Does Zoe know why
he wanted to kill her?

348
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,680
She's just grateful you happened
to come along.

349
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,520
- Is that what you told the police?
- I figured they wouldn't want to hear...

350
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,200
...I got a vision from an old, blind lady.

351
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,280
I'm not sure how I feel
about Cassandra.

352
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,480
Mom, she's my friend.

353
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,880
She told me
my destiny was to help people.

354
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,880
You don't think she knows your secret?

355
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,200
- You shouldn't see her anymore.
- Lf I hadn't seen her, Zoe would be dead!

356
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,480
Your destiny may be to protect people,
but ours is to protect you...

357
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,360
...and that's gotta come first, okay?

358
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,880
My mom said you called?

359
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,200
Is this the Porsche from...?

360
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,480
I don't understand.
Why do you still have it?

361
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,200
I once read about a rich man
who survived a hotel fire.

362
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:36,120
He hung onto the ledge for an hour
before the fire department rescued him.

363
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:41,920
Afterwards, he bought the hotel.
Always stayed in that room.

364
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,480
When they asked him why, he said
he figured fate couldn't find him twice.

365
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,760
I thought you didn't believe in fate.

366
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,640
I don't. But every time
I look at this car, I wonder.

367
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,880
I had a team go over this thing
inch by inch.

368
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,240
They tell me there's no way the impact
could have ripped open the roof like this.

369
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,800
They must have made a mistake.

370
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,280
Do you remember anything
about the accident?

371
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,320
No, just that I pulled you out, that's it.

372
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,600
I thought you might be able
to tell me more.

373
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,320
I'm sorry.

374
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,400
It's a little strange to be walking around
when every shred of evidence...

375
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,280
...says I should be dead.
An unsolved mystery, I guess.

376
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,320
Maybe fate has something else
in mind for you.

377
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,280
You've been spending
too much time with Cassandra.

378
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,280
At least she doesn't dwell on the past.

379
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,760
Lex, you're alive.

380
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,840
The question that you need to ask
is where do you go from here?

381
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,760
I'm here to pick up the kid from the
Beanery assault, take him into custody.

382
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,360
The young John Doe. He's all yours.
We've got him locked up in here.

383
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,680
I checked on him this morning.
He's sleeping like a baby.

384
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,120
Help me.

385
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,200
The police questioned Harry
all morning.

386
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,480
He said he was kidnapped by this kid
who was obsessed with his old case.

387
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,400
Somehow, in broad daylight,
this kid got out of handcuffs...

388
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,000
...smuggled Harry inside
and chained him to a bed?

389
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,840
That's the official story.

390
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,160
It may be official,
but it doesn't make sense.

391
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,320
You can always add it
to the Wall of Weird.

392
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,880
Clark, are you all right?

393
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:41,400
Not really. I think I'll go inside
and talk to Harry.

394
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,400
I found a picture of Zoe Garfield
in a box under your bed.

395
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,680
- And who are you?
- Clark Kent, but we've already met.

396
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,400
How dare you go through my belongings.

397
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,880
- How do you explain the pictures?
- And why do I need to explain them?

398
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,880
You know what, Harry?

399
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,720
I think you and this kid
are the same person.

400
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,200
I'd say you have
a very active imagination.

401
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
I don't know how you did it,
but I know it's you.

402
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,240
You said your name was Kent?

403
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,880
Grandfather, Hiram. Father, Jonathan.

404
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:34,720
Funny. I don't remember you
on the family tree.

405
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,720
I'll be watching you.

406
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,240
Nurse?

407
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:49,000
Nurse! Help me, somebody! Help!

408
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,400
Oh, nurse! Nurse, he's harassing me.
Haven't I been through enough?

409
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,840
- I think you should leave, young man.
- Don't worry, I'm going.

410
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,200
This is everything
I could find on Harry Volk.

411
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,160
The Ledger carried stories on the trial...

412
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,200
...the murder, the investigation,
you name it.

413
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,800
- Is anybody watching this guy?
- Lana's got an eye on him.

414
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,880
I heard that.

415
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,280
- What exactly are we looking for?
- I don't know.

416
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,240
There's gotta be a connection
between the people Harry's going after.

417
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,400
In Zoe's statement, she said Harry
accused her grandmother...

418
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,680
...of killing his future.

419
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,640
Harry's gone. They found his wheelchair
out by the koi pond half an hour ago.

420
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,640
I saw meteor rocks in that pond.

421
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,800
At least now we know
how he's doing the time warp.

422
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,800
- What do you mean?
- I'll explain later.

423
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,800
We gotta figure out
who he's gonna kill next.

424
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,000
- Clark, take a look at this.
- What is it?

425
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,040
List of the jurors
that worked on Harry's trial.

426
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,800
Randolph Gage, Rita Garfield...

427
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,480
He's killing the descendents
of the jurors who convicted him.

428
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,160
Talk about not letting it go.

429
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,000
- Clark, what is it?
- Look at juror number 11.

430
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,880
Hiram Kent.
Wasn't that your grandfather?

431
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,680
Harry's gonna kill my dad.

432
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,720
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, got a report about a gas leak.

433
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,520
You mind if I come in?

434
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,000
Gas leak. I don't smell gas.

435
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,560
Your husband called about it earlier.
Is he around?

436
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,400
He'll be back shortly.
Where's our regular gas man, Kurt?

437
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,720
- Vacation.
- That's right.

438
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,960
Would you excuse me a minute?

439
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,080
Kurt isn't your regular gas man,
is he, Mrs. Kent?

440
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,200
- What do you want?
- Kill your husband.

441
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,920
- What did Jonathan ever do to you?
- Nothing.

442
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,520
But his father did.

443
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,160
Come on, Mrs. Kent!
I'm too old for hide-and-seek!

444
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,280
Jonathan!

445
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,480
You can't save him, Mrs. Kent.

446
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,800
- Clark!
- Are you okay?

447
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,960
- What's the matter?
- Where's Mom?

448
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,640
- I don't know.
- Somebody's trying to kill you.

449
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,920
What?

450
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,200
He's already here.

451
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,520
No!

452
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,720
Martha. Martha!

453
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,880
Mom! Mom!

454
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,680
Martha, come on!

455
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,360
Mom, come on! Mom!

456
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,160
Martha!

457
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,520
- Come on, Mom, breathe!
- Martha!

458
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,440
Are you okay?

459
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,400
You think I'd ever leave you two alone?

460
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,080
Cassandra was wrong, Clark.

461
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,280
Nobody's gonna die.

462
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:25,560
Well. You're the last person
I expected to walk through my door.

463
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,720
I come bearing gifts.

464
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,840
So did the Greeks.

465
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,520
I wanted to take you up on your offer.

466
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,480
I thought you controlled
your own destiny.

467
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:44,640
I do. But certain things have happened
in my life, signs I don't want to ignore.

468
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,600
- What kind of signs?
- I lived when I should have died.

469
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,440
There must be a reason for that.
You see, I don't want to do good things.

470
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,720
- I want to do great things.
- Well, you don't need me for that.

471
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,200
What's the matter, Cassandra?
Are you afraid of what you'll see?

472
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,360
Sit.

473
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,280
Well. You've been warned.

474
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,280
What did you see?

475
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,720
I need some help in here!

476
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,920
Somebody?

477
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,680
Ms. Carver?

478
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,600
I'm sorry, son, she's gone.

479
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,360
- She saw it.
- Saw what?

480
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,400
Her future.

481
