1
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,598
This is what I love about high-school parties.
People will gather anywhere...

2
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,708
...as long as there's alcohol
and the chance of hooking up.

3
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,004
If I recall, you're the one
who wanted to come to this party.

4
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:50,809
I didn't know it was gonna be so cold.
It's like 20,000 degrees below zero.

5
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:54,351
-It doesn't feel that cold to me.
-What, are you from an ice planet?

6
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,251
I'm gonna go thaw out by the fire.

7
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,321
Have fun.

8
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,065
Hey, Kent.

9
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:15,236
You're friends with Chloe.
Is she flying solo tonight?

10
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,535
Believe me, Sean, you're not her type.

11
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,645
Well, you'd be surprised.

12
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,022
If you want, I could rub them for you.

13
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:35,120
Well, nothing heats up the body
like friction.

14
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:41,493
Wow. I can't believe you just delivered
that line with a straight face.

15
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,136
All I did was offer to keep
your hands warm, Chloe.

16
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:49,041
-And he knows my name.
-I've read your editorials in the <i>Torch.</i>

17
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,303
-Pretty cool.
-Well, thank you, Sean.

18
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:57,010
I sit next to Jenna in bio class.
Remember, you dumped her last week?

19
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:02,252
-It was mutual.
-So you're here trolling for fresh meat.

20
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:05,687
Don't worry, Chloe.
I'm not gonna make a move on you.

21
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,089
No matter how pretty I think you are.

22
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:11,128
Sean, Hail Marys down by the lake.

23
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,895
Yeah.

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,131
-Hey, can I get your number?
-Why? You're never going to call.

25
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:23,867
-I'll call you tomorrow. I promise.
-Well, I won't hold my breath.

26
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,354
-Come on, Sean, let's go.
-Hey, Whitney, back pass.

27
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:54,765
Did you just write your phone number
down on Sean Kelvin's hand?

28
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,565
Don't sound so shocked, Clark.

29
00:02:56,743 --> 00:03:00,372
Guys do find me attractive even though
I don't have raven hair and the initials "L.L."

30
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,208
That's not what I meant.

31
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:05,180
-The guy's a dog.
-Clark, relax.

32
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:10,152
I just gave him my number to get rid
of him. Get Pete. The taxi's leaving.

33
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,319
-What's with you and that Chloe Sullivan?
-What do you mean?

34
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:21,524
-The girl from the <i>Torch.</i> You into her?
-Another notch, dog.

35
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,698
That's cold.

36
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,068
Hey, hold on, pizza's here.

37
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:33,778
-Sorry, dude.
-Go ahead. I'll get the ball.

38
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,218
Whoa.

39
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,291
Hey, where's Sean?

40
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,158
I don't know. He's probably
in the back of some car.

41
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:54,642
-The distributor gets 12.5.
-Feed bill over six months at 5%.

42
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,748
Plus the mortgage at 8.2.

43
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,817
-Plus the harvester repairs gives us--
-Fifty-four thousand...

44
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,955
...five hundred and one dollars
and thirty-eight cents.

45
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:07,653
Hey, son. Look, I'm sorry. We didn't
mean for you to hear all that.

46
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,193
You don't have to protect me.
Is it that bad?

47
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,524
It's pretty bad.
We might have to take out a loan.

48
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:15,997
-Another one? The interest would put us--
-Clark, don't.

49
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,099
-Maybe I can help.
-You have.

50
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,503
-Last season you saved us four hands.
-I'm thinking bigger picture.

51
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:26,475
Forget about this whole high-school thing
and try out for a pro sports team.

52
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,137
I could make a ton of money
in endorsements.

53
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,249
Just trying to lighten the mood.

54
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,251
Much as we'd love to see
your face on a cereal box...

55
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,754
...we'd settle for you getting
to school on time.

56
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,525
Forgot.

57
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,288
-That's 65,200--
-Go.

58
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,763
And one.

59
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,735
-So did Sean call?
-Negative.

60
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:56,204
Not that I was waiting by the phone
or anything.

61
00:07:56,375 --> 00:08:00,209
Maybe he got caught up. One time
my sister didn't hear from a guy for a week.

62
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,279
Turned out his grandmother died.

63
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:05,383
As much as I appreciate
the spotlight here, I'm fine.

64
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,281
You're probably better off.
Sean's a total dog anyway.

65
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,252
He's not that bad, Clark.
He's always been cool to me.

66
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:15,292
Because you can't get past your Lana crush,
don't knock us for making a love connection.

67
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,951
I thought we were focusing on me.

68
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,461
-I don't have a crush on Lana.
-Then ask another girl out.

69
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:20,894
-Like who?
-Like Chloe.

70
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,230
I'm not a crash-test dummy you
can use to try out your dating skills.

71
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,769
You, if you like Lana so much...

72
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,702
...why don't you just ask her out?

73
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,070
And, you,
stop acting like a Vegas bookie...

74
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:35,203
...picks your dates.
And both of you? Treat me better.

75
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:53,690
This is the flu season, young man.
I don't even know why you came in today.

76
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,495
I felt fine this morning,
and now I can't get warm.

77
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,733
Let's see.

78
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,903
This can't be right.
You're not a Popsicle.

79
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,978
Let's try again.

80
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,582
Here we go.

81
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,254
Now you're giving me the chills.
I'm sending you home.

82
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:28,892
I'm all right. I'm actually feeling
a little better now. Thanks.

83
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:42,979
Whoa!

84
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,046
I come in peace.

85
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:49,511
-I'm so sorry. I didn't hear you.
-I'm just glad you weren't welding.

86
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:53,216
-What brings you out here?
-Those artichokes of yours.

87
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:56,327
-I need about 30 if you've got them.
-Thirty. That's a lot.

88
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:59,293
I'm hosting a dinner tomorrow
for the local farming community.

89
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:03,526
Just a talk about some financial options.
A lot of farms are having money trouble.

90
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:08,402
-Most people aren't looking for more loans.
-I'm offering my role as an investor.

91
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,736
Help people modernize and expand.

92
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,847
This town once grew
20% of the corn in the state.

93
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,815
Smallville was a heavy hitter.
It just lost the drive to stay competitive.

94
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,544
Or its connections.

95
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:25,657
If this town ever had connections,
they wouldn't have named it Smallville.

96
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:32,026
Your husband hasn't kept
his feelings about me a secret.

97
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,960
I'd appreciate hearing your thoughts,
even if you're not interested.

98
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:41,767
Jonathan doesn't hate you. It's just, your
family's track record hasn't been the best.

99
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,136
Tell him I intend to change that.

100
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,294
That's a great exhibit.
Caught it in St. Petersburg.

101
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:06,863
Whitney and I are going to Metropolis.
I thought we'd check it out.

102
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,160
Trying to give the quarterback some culture?

103
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,597
It was his idea.

104
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,171
He figures one afternoon at the museum,
he's off the hook for six months.

105
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,400
For someone who wants people
to keep an open mind...

106
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,476
-...you're quick to judge.
-Hey, Whitney.

107
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:22,637
What can I say? I just think
you're with the wrong guy.

108
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:27,914
Hey.

109
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,153
Everything okay?

110
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:34,417
Yeah, I was just checking out
some stuff for us to do tomorrow.

111
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,629
Metropolis, remember?

112
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:46,933
Some of the guys are pulling together
and getting the fight on pay-per-view.

113
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,866
It's tomorrow.

114
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,376
And you gave them your money already.

115
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,036
Yeah.

116
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,816
Hey, we'll go next weekend, okay?
I promise.

117
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,979
-I'm really sorry, Lana.
-Culture can wait.

118
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,656
I'll make it up to you.

119
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,222
See you.

120
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,377
You know, she's free tomorrow night.
Hey, Clark.

121
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,312
This is the perfect time
for you to ask her out.

122
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,146
She's got a boyfriend, Lex.

123
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,756
A high-school boyfriend
isn't a husband, he's an obstacle.

124
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:42,223
I bet if you ask Lana to go with you
to the Radiohead concert, she'll say yes.

125
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,228
-And if she says yes?
-I'll give you the tickets.

126
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,730
Why are you doing this?

127
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:56,698
You're like the younger brother I never had.
Someone should benefit from my experience.

128
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,242
-I can't just ask her out.
-The hardest thing...

129
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,936
...is telling the girl you love
that you like her.

130
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,178
I'll raise the bet.
You ask her in the next 60 seconds...

131
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:10,618
...you get the tickets and I'll throw in
a roundtrip limo ride. Starting now.

132
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,237
-Hey, Lana, you busy?
-Completely swamped.

133
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:31,069
That's why I'm sitting in a coffee shop
trying to wade through a Russian classic.

134
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,842
That was a joke, Clark.

135
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,343
Good. Because there's this
thing tomorrow night.

136
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,384
Define "thing."

137
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:46,389
It's a concert. Radiohead, to be exact,
and I've got a couple of tickets.

138
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,392
Wow. Where'd you get these?

139
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,560
A friend. Something came up
at the last minute...

140
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,632
...and I was wondering if you'd like to go,
you know, with me.

141
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,130
-I'd--
-Just as friends.

142
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,636
Definitely. I'd love to.

143
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,245
Let me get this straight.
You walked in to get a cappuccino...

144
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,682
...and walked out with a date
with Lana Lang.

145
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,116
It's not actually a date.

146
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,688
Even with the "just as friends" rider,
I'm impressed.

147
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,223
How did you score the tickets?

148
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,828
I'm guessing a certain follically challenged
individual was behind it.

149
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,556
Lex hooked me up.
Actually, Chloe, I have you to thank.

150
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,633
-What did I do?
-You were right. I just had to get it out.

151
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,134
Well, good. I'm glad.

152
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,407
Maybe this is your chance.

153
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,646
Chloe, don't I owe you a phone call?

154
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,580
-I guess so.
-What are you doing right now?

155
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,245
Well, I've got to put the paper to bed.

156
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,616
Maybe afterwards we could
do something.

157
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,127
Jenna, Jenna, wait up.

158
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,403
Okay, I was playing barely
hard to get. What's the problem?

159
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,005
Clark Kent gets a date
with Lana Lang...

160
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:14,111
...and suddenly there's no luck
left for the rest of us.

161
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,236
Sean, is that you?

162
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,810
I've been waiting for you.

163
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,722
Thought you might like
to take a shower.

164
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,893
Sean?

165
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,404
Well, what are you waiting for?

166
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,279
The water's nice and warm.

167
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,285
Sean?

168
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,791
Sean, what happened to you?

169
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:54,909
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what's wrong with me.

170
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:01,578
Sean, you're really scaring me.
What do you want?

171
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:05,022
I just want to get warm.

172
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:57,601
It's bad enough you ride that motorcycle,
but do you have to repair it in the house?

173
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,370
If I didn't, you'd never
have a reason to be angry with me.

174
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:04,778
I'll trade you. Do all the engine work
you want, but come with me to Lex's.

175
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,612
-We've already talked about that.
-I talked, you grunted.

176
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,152
I thought that I was rather articulate.

177
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:14,088
Sweetheart, the Luthors have sold out
anyone who's ever trusted them.

178
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,022
They don't keep their word.

179
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,287
"They" is Lex's father, not him.

180
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,559
Be honest, you've never seen him
be anything but generous.

181
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:26,602
Arrogant and a little strange, yes,
but he's been a good friend to Clark.

182
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,307
-We have to at least hear him out.
-Why?

183
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:34,071
We need options, Jonathan.
Our home is on the line. Our farm.

184
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:38,080
You don't have to like him to listen.
Besides...

185
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,810
...I already told him we would come.

186
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,486
-Hello, citizens.
-I'm not familiar with this child.

187
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:49,423
-Where's the moody one, lives upstairs?
-He's going on a date tonight.

188
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:53,759
-Not a "date" date, but to a concert.
-Who might this "not a 'date' date" be with?

189
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,331
Lana Lang.

190
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,432
Lex hooked me up with
tickets and his limo.

191
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,765
-He did?
-It's okay if I go, right?

192
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:05,273
Well, I guess Lex Luthor has worked
out all of our evenings for us.

193
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,510
Clark. Isn't Lana still going out
with Whitney?

194
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,713
She's not married, Mom.

195
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:25,725
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Bella. Bella, it's me, Sean.

196
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,456
<i>What do you want?</i>

197
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,693
Well, I thought we might get together,
do something?

198
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,530
<i>Yeah, like that's gonna happen.</i>

199
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,807
Come on, Bell,
we were good together once.

200
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,807
Sure, I might have made some
mistakes, but, you know....

201
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,673
-<i>Save it for some other girl.</i>
-Bella.

202
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,343
Bella!

203
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,087
Chloe.

204
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,628
Your online horoscope suggests that
you try not to flaunt your excitement.

205
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:08,034
Which will be hard, since you've waited
for this date since your first growth spurt.

206
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:12,166
I'll say this once more, then I'll print up
bumper stickers. This isn't a date.

207
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,175
All right. Just check Lana's outfit.

208
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,179
If a girl wears something new,
she thinks it's a date.

209
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:20,250
-I thought you came over for fashion advice?
-Burn that.

210
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,080
What else have you got?

211
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,247
I'll check the laundry basket.

212
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,929
-Hello.
-<i>Hey, Chloe.</i>

213
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,261
-Sean, hi.
-<i>Don't I owe you an apology?</i>

214
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:40,838
-Guess who just called me. Sean.
-Did he apologize for blowing you off?

215
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,940
He said he wasn't feeling well.

216
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:46,874
Chloe, I saw him go off with Jenna.
Maybe she made him feel better.

217
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:50,208
Well, he promised it was completely
over with her.

218
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,179
You like him, don't you?

219
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,942
He may be a little intellectually challenged,
but he's really hot.

220
00:20:56,121 --> 00:21:00,649
He begged to get together, just to talk. I told
him he could bring me a coffee at the <i>Torch.</i>

221
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,290
-Sounds like a date.
-It's not a date.

222
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,987
It's a fact-finding mission to see
if he deserves a date.

223
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,390
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

224
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:13,266
Don't worry. I figure if you can take
a risk with Lana, I can take a shot too.

225
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,668
-Blue's a good color on you.
-Really?

226
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,249
Welcome.

227
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,379
I'm delighted you decided to come.

228
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,388
-Your house is very--
-Large?

229
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,958
To put it mildly.

230
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,495
The word "restraint" doesn't exist
in my father's vocabulary.

231
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,826
I'm sorry, are we early?

232
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,931
I think we should go.

233
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:51,599
-Wait, just because no one else came....
-That's if anyone else was even invited.

234
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,237
-I don't think Lex would--
-Actually, I would. I did.

235
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,441
But only because I knew you
wouldn't have come otherwise.

236
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:03,519
I know your farm's in trouble,
Mr. Kent. Small town.

237
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,919
So you thought you would take advantage
of my family's problem.

238
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,127
No. I thought I could help.

239
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,963
Well, then, I guess we're here to listen.

240
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,345
I've never actually sat
in a limo before tonight.

241
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,652
I did once. Nell got one to take us to
the ballet. But it wasn't as nice as this.

242
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,387
Beats another night
of defensive reading.

243
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:49,398
You've done it since we were kids.
Whenever the world gets disappointing...

244
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,627
...you retreat into a book.

245
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,640
There are worse things.

246
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:04,076
No, you're right. It's just easier than dealing
with my own life, you know what I mean?

247
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,308
I do the same thing with astronomy.

248
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:10,251
I look at different worlds and wonder
if my life would be better there.

249
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,721
You always seem to understand
what I'm trying to say.

250
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,055
-How come you know so much?
-Magic.

251
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,293
You don't believe in magic?

252
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,031
I'll show you.

253
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,264
Pick a card.

254
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,907
All right.

255
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,783
Three of hearts.

256
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,419
Full of surprises.

257
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,361
This is weird, huh?

258
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,940
I felt like I had to explain
tonight to Nell.

259
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:08,341
I spent the better part of the day
convincing people this was not a date.

260
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,948
How about Whitney?

261
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,177
-I didn't tell him.
-You feeling guilty about that?

262
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:21,049
He's hanging out with his friends,
and I'm hanging out with mine.

263
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,086
Exactly.

264
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,826
<i>And in Smallville tonight, police</i>
<i>are seeking 17-year-old Sean Kelvin...</i>

265
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:35,734
<i>...after the mysterious death of fellow</i>
<i>Smallville High student Jenna Barham...</i>

266
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,273
-<i>...whose body was found this afternoon.</i>
-Oh, my God.

267
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,240
-<i>Kelvin was last seen....</i>
-Stop the car!

268
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:07,866
Sean? Hello, is that you?

269
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,485
Okay, this is interesting.

270
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,561
-Clark, what's wrong?
-It's complicated.

271
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,762
Hang out here for a while.
I want you to be safe.

272
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,066
-Safe from what?
-I promise I'll explain.

273
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,402
-Will you wait for me?
-Sure.

274
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:49,469
I just want you to know that this is
the best non-date that I've ever had.

275
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,538
Sean?

276
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:23,176
What's going on?
I agreed to a cappuccino.

277
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,313
If you think I'm skinny-dipping
with you, try again, buddy.

278
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:39,897
I'm sorry, Chloe.
I don't have a choice.

279
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:44,357
-What happened to you?
-I can't stay warm.

280
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:49,072
-Well, why don't you just sit by a fire?
-Because I only get a quick fix.

281
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,207
Body heat lasts longer.

282
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,770
-No!
-I promise it won't hurt, Chloe.

283
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,537
Clark!

284
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,948
-Clark, help!
-Are you okay?

285
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:36,110
My foot's stuck.

286
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,288
You okay?

287
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,230
Go! Run!

288
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:06,940
-Did I thank you for that rescue yet?
-I heard about Jenna...

289
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,177
...and I didn't want you to be next.

290
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:13,483
Well, I finally find a guy I like,
and he turns out to be homicidal.

291
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,492
You deserved a lot better than Sean
even before he tried to kill you.

292
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,893
-That's sweet. I think.
-Any idea what happened to him?

293
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,494
Only thing I can find is a medical condition
where there's damage...

294
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,762
...to the thermosensitive cells
in the brain.

295
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:31,398
The person literally can't stay warm.
It's like a permanent case of hypothermia.

296
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:35,740
-Sean's getting heat where he can take it.
-Preferably from high-school girls.

297
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:39,975
But, I mean, you saw the pool.
You take heat out of water, you get ice.

298
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:43,854
He's like-- He's like a battery
that can't hold its charge.

299
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:46,422
-We should call for help.
-I'll take care of that.

300
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:49,424
We need to get you home. Come on.

301
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,221
You have to believe me when I say that
almost getting my heat sucked...

302
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,630
...was not a passive-aggressive
attempt to ruin your date.

303
00:28:58,503 --> 00:28:59,765
Lana.

304
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,968
-Let's sit right here.
-Okay.

305
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,467
Thanks.

306
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,706
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

307
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,483
Shouldn't you be fifth-row center
right about now?

308
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:20,249
-Hey, Pete.
-Where's Clark?

309
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:26,089
I don't know. He saw that news report
about Jenna and suddenly had to run.

310
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:30,064
I heard that too. I always thought
that Sean was a good guy.

311
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,829
I guess we don't know people
as well as we think.

312
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,941
You've been friends with Clark
for a long time.

313
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,236
-Is he always so...?
-Clark-like?

314
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,214
Sometimes he's totally there
and you think you know everything...

315
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:47,317
-...and then there's this part that's....
-Mysterious.

316
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:52,388
Yeah, that's it. Clark Kent,
international man of mystery.

317
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,658
Whatever it was seemed important.

318
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:58,353
I can't believe there's anything
more important to him than you.

319
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,321
Lana, what are you doing here?

320
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,031
Just reading.

321
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:08,069
Pretty dressed up to be digging
into a book.

322
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,338
I'll catch up with you later.

323
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,011
Pete, why don't you take
your date for a spin in the limo.

324
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:19,746
-She's not a date. She's just my friend.
-Either way, I won't be needing it.

325
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,586
Thanks.

326
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,288
What were you doing in a limo?

327
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:35,455
Just hanging out with a friend.
Could you take me home?

328
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,666
This can't be happening.

329
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,412
Sean.

330
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,595
Guess the generator works.
Power must have blown.

331
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,324
-Where were we?
-You were explaining how you could...

332
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,162
-...single-handedly save the family farm.
-Jonathan.

333
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:48,863
It's okay, Mrs. Kent, I understand
your husband's skepticism.

334
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,808
Your farm's drowning in debt,
we both know it.

335
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,945
I'm trying to offer you a hand,
but you keep slapping it away.

336
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:58,281
I learned a long time ago
from a man much smarter than myself...

337
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:02,749
-...that you need to solve your own problems.
-Your father lived in different times.

338
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,980
And he had his share of help.

339
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:10,053
Seems government subsidies carried
him through a number of lean years.

340
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,402
-Where did you get these?
-It's public record.

341
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:24,502
I'm making a business offer.
I had to do my due diligence.

342
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,474
Why are you so interested
in our family, Lex?

343
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:31,547
Your son brought me back
from the dead, Mr. Kent.

344
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,613
When he reached in and pulled me out,
he gave me a new life.

345
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:41,689
Your father put his family's future
over his own pride.

346
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,386
Are you willing to do that?

347
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:05,239
I know this is probably one of those
times I should just let things go...

348
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,283
...but I'd kind of like to know
what's going on.

349
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,783
You went out with your friends, I went out
with Clark. He invited me to a concert.

350
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,557
So you two were just hanging out.

351
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:20,129
-Right.
-Was this a test to see what I'd do?

352
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:24,101
-Why didn't you just tell me?
-I knew you'd overreact.

353
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,997
You go on a date with another guy,
and I'm overreacting.

354
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,231
It wasn't a date.
Clark's a friend, that's it.

355
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,171
-Whitney, look out!
-Sean!

356
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,377
Hold on!

357
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:06,204
-Lana, are you okay?
-My ankle hurts. I think I twisted it.

358
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,107
-Where did Sean go?
-I don't know.

359
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,976
But I've gotta get you somewhere safe.
Hold on.

360
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,751
Come on.

361
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,851
-You all right?
-Yeah.

362
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:27,396
Come on. Those lights are over at the
Luthor house, just down the road. Come on.

363
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,858
So you would give us the latest
farming equipment and technology.

364
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:33,128
All in exchange for our independence.

365
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:37,536
My influence will be minimal but
existing, yes. It's a partnership.

366
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,469
-We could get a loan.
-Or you can allow me...

367
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:44,274
...to help you get to the point where you
never need someone like me again.

368
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:48,277
-I'll admit, it looks generous.
-It is.

369
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:52,116
Which begs the question, what does
Lex Luthor get out of all of this?

370
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:56,553
I believe there's profit to be made.
I'm not exactly in the charity business.

371
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,820
Like father like son.

372
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,995
Take some time to think about it.

373
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:05,465
I'm sure you'll see the benefits outweigh
your other options. To the future.

374
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,705
-Lana.
-She's okay.

375
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,503
Where's Clark?

376
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,743
Thanks for the warm-up, Clark.

377
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,163
This kid sounds dangerous.
I've got the gate down and the alarm on.

378
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:20,566
You're staying here until they find Sean.
Sorry about your date.

379
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,676
No. I'm still getting
the answering machine at home.

380
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:33,847
-Remind me I don't have to worry.
-He's Clark, Martha.

381
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,419
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

382
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:13,291
-I'll go check the front gate.
-It should be secure.

383
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:17,662
-I'll check the generator. Where is it?
-On the side of the house, but I can get it.

384
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,509
Hello.

385
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,724
-Are you Sean?
-Yes, ma'am.

386
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,692
-What do you want?
-Who, me?

387
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,919
I just wanna get warm.

388
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,123
-Get away from her, Sean.
-Clark.

389
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,927
Go in the house, Mom.

390
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,528
-Go now.
-That's your mom?

391
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:59,033
-She's hot.
-Sean, you have to get to a hospital.

392
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:03,143
What are they gonna do?
Put me under an electric blanket?

393
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:07,614
I need heat, Clark. Contact. That's the
only thing that's gonna work for me.

394
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:11,321
-Every person's another fix.
-You're not getting into that house.

395
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:14,725
Who's gonna stop me? You?

396
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:49,317
I don't know what it is about you, Clark,
but I haven't felt this good in two days.

397
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,189
And when I'm done with you,
there's your mom...

398
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:57,690
-...your dad and Lana.
-I'll never let you hurt them.

399
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:34,901
Good morning.

400
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,400
-I heard you took out a bank loan today.
-Did you?

401
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,869
After our conversation the other night,
I was frankly surprised.

402
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,278
Do you despise me that much?

403
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,282
Believe it or not, Lex...

404
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:53,518
...some things actually
have nothing to do with you.

405
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:56,482
I decided to bet on my family.

406
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,421
You're betting with Clark's future.

407
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,861
-I'm just trying to insure it.
-Yeah, so am I.

408
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,294
With the bank?

409
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,664
They'll kill you with interest
while waiting for you to fail.

410
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:10,505
At least with the bank,
I know where I stand.

411
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:15,176
I know you don't believe me,
but I genuinely want to help you.

412
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,181
When you change your mind,
my offer still stands.

413
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:41,769
You okay?

414
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:46,340
Yeah. The memorial service is tomorrow.

415
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:54,250
I was thinking how that
could have been me.

416
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:59,255
All because some guy expressed
a modicum of interest in me.

417
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,055
I thought I was stronger than that.

418
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:08,689
Everybody's searching for their soul mate.
It's not a sign of weakness.

419
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:13,794
I can't believe both your dates went straight
to hell, and I ended up with the limo.

420
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,802
-How was that?
-It was sweet.

421
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,168
I've already hooked up
with another date.

422
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:21,311
-I'm swearing off men.
-They're not all bad.

423
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,778
Maybe you should just swear off
heat-sucking horn dogs.

424
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:30,180
Yeah, the next time a guy asks me out,
I'm doing an in-depth background check.

425
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,683
Come on, Pete.
Clark will catch up with us later.

426
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,598
Lana.

427
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,929
-Hey, how's your ankle?
-It's better, thanks.

428
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,673
You never came back the other night.

429
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:58,008
I did, but you were gone.

430
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:04,019
I'm sorry. I wanted things
to work out differently.

431
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,346
Don't worry about it.

432
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:12,492
I was thinking maybe we could try
again sometime. How about Saturday?

433
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:17,057
Whitney's taking me to the city.
He's got the whole day planned.

434
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,702
I think our non-date freaked him out.

435
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,572
-What'd you tell him?
-The truth.

436
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,870
That we're just friends.

437
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,711
I have to go.

438
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,684
Lana.

439
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:42,256
Why do you go out with him?
Whitney, I mean.

440
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,161
Because whenever I need him,
he's there.

441
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,655
Guess he makes me feel safe.

442
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:03,236
