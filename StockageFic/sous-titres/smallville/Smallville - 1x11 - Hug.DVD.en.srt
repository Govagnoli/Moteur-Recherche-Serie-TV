1
00:00:11,236 --> 00:00:13,534
Killer view.

2
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:17,731
Good morning, Mr. Rickman.
Thank you for coming in.

3
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,108
So, what can I do for
the Center for Environmental Protection?

4
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:25,414
I heard your people were in Smallville
doing some surveying.

5
00:00:25,584 --> 00:00:29,042
I wanted to discuss your intentions.

6
00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:31,753
My intentions are to build a new plant.

7
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:36,289
What's this?

8
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:39,625
Ground water from the last town
where you built a plant.

9
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:42,198
Well, I find that very hard to believe.

10
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:46,201
Rickman Industries has always had a very
good relationship with the CEP, Paul.

11
00:00:47,873 --> 00:00:49,898
-Can I call you Paul?
-No.

12
00:00:50,075 --> 00:00:54,205
Tomorrow I'll have a restraining order
preventing you from moving into Smallville...

13
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:57,871
...until every case against you is settled.

14
00:00:59,218 --> 00:01:02,881
It's too bad. l--
Well, I have my mind set on Smallville.

15
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:07,617
This town has a special place in my heart.

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,395
I don't suppose there's anything
I could do to change your mind.

17
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:15,966
I'm afraid I'm not as easy to buy off
as my colleagues.

18
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:20,797
I've never bought off a soul in my life.

19
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:22,736
People listen to me because I'm right.

20
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:24,773
When they do, they end up better for it.

21
00:01:24,943 --> 00:01:27,810
Tell that to the 96 cases
of vinyl chloride poisoning...

22
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,472
...l've tied to your pesticide plants.

23
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,982
Well, I see there's little else to do.

24
00:01:40,826 --> 00:01:43,761
Just want to tell you how much
I appreciate your candor.

25
00:01:44,263 --> 00:01:46,356
I wish you luck.

26
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:59,375
Now, listen, Paul--
I can call you Paul, can't I?

27
00:02:02,614 --> 00:02:04,445
I guess.

28
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,186
Now, you strike me
as a man of passion, Paul.

29
00:02:10,355 --> 00:02:13,119
Passion hurts, doesn't it?

30
00:02:13,358 --> 00:02:17,954
People don't understand. They don't see
how you devote yourself to what's right.

31
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:21,155
I bet you're afraid.

32
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:25,094
You give all that passion
to a job no one even cares about.

33
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,033
No.

34
00:02:30,876 --> 00:02:32,309
-Yes.
-Yes.

35
00:02:36,882 --> 00:02:39,817
Look at that world out there, Paul.

36
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:42,983
Is any part of it yours?

37
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,215
No.

38
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:52,223
All that pain you feel,
there's only one way to make it stop.

39
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:21,589
Going down?

40
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:33,030
Thanks.

41
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:45,873
Tyler, bring the car around.
We're going to Smallville.

42
00:04:37,836 --> 00:04:40,771
Okay, here we go.

43
00:04:41,506 --> 00:04:44,441
I thought learning to drive
my dad's Volvo was difficult...

44
00:04:44,609 --> 00:04:46,839
...but at least the car had
windshield wipers.

45
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:50,379
-Chloe, you're doing fine for your first time.
-No, no, we're turning.

46
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:52,947
So how's Whitney holding up?

47
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:56,952
His dad's still in the hospital, so he's
been working extra shifts at the store.

48
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:59,022
It's tough running a family business.

49
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:03,287
He secretly wants his dad to sell it.
He doesn't want it when he graduates.

50
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:07,023
I don't blame him. I don't see myself
being a farmer when I grow up.

51
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,861
-Well, what do you want to do?
-I'm not sure...

52
00:05:10,035 --> 00:05:13,971
...as long as it doesn't involve putting
on a suit and doing a lot of flying.

53
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:18,540
I dropped my camera.

54
00:05:19,144 --> 00:05:21,044
What'd you bring that thing for anyway?

55
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:23,875
I'm not out here doing
this butt-bashing thing for fun.

56
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:26,813
These woods are like the Bermuda Triangle
of Smallville.

57
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,487
People come in here,
and when they leave...

58
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:33,988
...they can't remember a thing. There've
been dozens of incidents the past 10 years.

59
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:37,822
-I'll go get you your camera.
-Thank you.

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,400
The stories in these woods
go back to the Civil War.

61
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:46,833
No, what I'm talking about
happened a week ago.

62
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:49,530
Surveyors from Rickman Industries
came out screaming...

63
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,575
-...and can't remember what happened.
-I'm sure you have a theory.

64
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:55,744
-Kyle Tippett.
-The guy who sells weird sculptures in town?

65
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:59,213
Don't you think it's odd that he lives
all alone out here in the woods?

66
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:00,440
Thoreau did.

67
00:06:00,852 --> 00:06:02,945
Yeah, Clark, so did the Unabomber.

68
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:06,381
Lana.

69
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:09,683
-Stay with the horses.
-Okay.

70
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:12,625
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, okay.

71
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:14,527
Easy, easy.

72
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,387
Get away from her!

73
00:06:37,722 --> 00:06:41,556
-You okay?
-Yeah, it's okay. I'm fine.

74
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,480
What do you think happened, son?

75
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:07,778
I don't know, but it just doesn't look
like he's trying to hurt her.

76
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:13,480
-Okay, Nell. Thanks. Bye.
-How's Lana?

77
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:15,956
A mild concussion.
Other than that, she's fine.

78
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:18,595
-And Nell?
-That's a different story.

79
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:21,926
She wants Clark to go to the police
and say he saw Kyle...

80
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,762
-...spook Lana's horse and attack her.
-I didn't see that.

81
00:07:24,936 --> 00:07:27,131
I don't think we've heard the end of this.

82
00:07:27,772 --> 00:07:30,502
Did Kyle seem at all dangerous to you?

83
00:07:30,675 --> 00:07:34,304
He seemed scared.

84
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,107
Chloe said some surveyors
were spooked last week...

85
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:39,443
...and now us.
I wonder if there's a connection.

86
00:07:39,618 --> 00:07:41,950
Jonathan, go talk to Kyle.
Get this cleared up.

87
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,883
-Yeah.
-No, I'll go.

88
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:47,024
-I don't think that's a good idea.
-It's not like he can hurt me.

89
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:49,050
That is not the point.

90
00:07:49,694 --> 00:07:54,529
Dad, I understand what it's like
to be hidden from the world.

91
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:56,860
Give me a shot.

92
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:03,134
-Do you know where Kyle lives?
-I just follow the trail of bad sculptures.

93
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:14,645
Miss Hardwick, I'm surprised
to find you in Smallville.

94
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,218
It grows on you after a while.

95
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:18,720
Don't encourage him, Victoria.

96
00:08:19,224 --> 00:08:21,658
It's funny. I was just saying
what this town needs...

97
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:24,226
...is more pesticides in the water supply.

98
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:27,593
Now, don't tell me you mind
someone else sharing your little sandbox.

99
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:30,667
Only when they're polluting it.
Hello, Bob.

100
00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:32,666
Lex?

101
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:37,005
I'll leave you boys alone.

102
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:43,239
Photos are a bit over the top,
but I like what you've done with the place.

103
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:45,849
Oh, it's only temporary.

104
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:48,746
Here, have a button.

105
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:51,087
Enough of these, and they won't notice...

106
00:08:51,256 --> 00:08:54,692
-...you're rendering the town uninhabitable.
-I'm just like you, Lex.

107
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:58,022
A government employee sets
my emissions levels, and I abide.

108
00:08:58,196 --> 00:08:59,424
Do you have an objection?

109
00:08:59,598 --> 00:09:02,931
Let's call it an interest.
Smallville's my home now.

110
00:09:03,101 --> 00:09:07,197
That's right. Yes, Lionel had mentioned
that he'd exiled you here.

111
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:10,705
-Had dinner with him a couple weeks ago.
-Yeah? What happened?

112
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,776
Somebody more important cancel on him?

113
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,213
Don't worry, Lex, I'll keep my concerns
away from the Luthors.

114
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:24,378
I found the perfect place for the plant.
It's out of the way, it's near the river.

115
00:09:24,556 --> 00:09:26,717
The Kent farm?

116
00:09:27,058 --> 00:09:28,958
I assume you've approached them.

117
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:30,321
It's just a formality.

118
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:35,293
The way licenses and zoning permits
always seem to be a formality for you, Bob.

119
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:40,234
I know the Kents, and not even you
can convince them to sell that farm.

120
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:43,901
You'd be surprised.

121
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:47,335
Trust me, Bob, you're not that charming.

122
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:27,107
You're trespassing.

123
00:10:27,285 --> 00:10:28,843
How'd you do that?

124
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,514
Magic. Haven't you heard of Crazy Kyle
who lives in the woods by himself?

125
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:38,356
He's somewhere between Bigfoot
and the Blair Witch.

126
00:10:38,863 --> 00:10:42,765
-I'm--
-Clark Kent, Jonathan and Martha's son.

127
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,196
How'd you know?

128
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:47,304
I live in a trailer, not a cave.

129
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:53,204
I wanted to talk to you about
what happened this afternoon.

130
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:54,640
You mean the girl?

131
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:57,475
The horse threw her,
and I made sure she was breathing.

132
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:01,141
So you don't make a habit
of scaring people out of the woods...

133
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:03,014
...and spooking their horses?

134
00:11:04,155 --> 00:11:07,716
If I wanted to explain myself all the time,
I'd get a job.

135
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:12,556
But I left that world behind for a reason.
Goodbye.

136
00:11:13,898 --> 00:11:15,661
Why are you so unfriendly?

137
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:18,826
-Because I'm not interested in friends.
-Everyone needs a friend.

138
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,163
No, they don't...

139
00:11:22,073 --> 00:11:24,405
...because they'll always betray you
in the end.

140
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,581
How are you feeling?

141
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:38,086
Better, thanks.

142
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,184
Nell said you're going to talk to the police.

143
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,885
Actually, I went out and spoke to Kyle.

144
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:47,058
You talked to that psycho?

145
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:51,267
Yeah.

146
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:55,570
He said he was making sure
Lana was okay.

147
00:11:56,107 --> 00:11:58,701
-Do you believe him?
-Yeah, I think I do.

148
00:11:58,877 --> 00:12:01,209
If I were there,
I would have done something.

149
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:08,946
-Do you remember anything?
-Not really.

150
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:13,788
I gotta get home. I'm glad you're okay.

151
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:21,395
That looked uncomfortable.

152
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:24,660
Listen, has Bob Rickman been by the farm?

153
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:28,402
-Why would he be interested in us?
-He's interested in buying your land.

154
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:32,134
You have met my dad.
Why are you even worried?

155
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,406
I've seen Rickman talk people out
of house and home. He's a locust, Clark.

156
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:39,914
He tears through a community
and betrays anyone who trusts him.

157
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:42,746
Tell your dad to be careful.

158
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:45,679
Okay.

159
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:52,092
Hello, Kyle.
Wondering when you'd stop by.

160
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:53,992
We had an agreement.

161
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:58,101
You do whatever you want with the rest
of the world, but leave this town alone.

162
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:01,830
Well, we made those rules a long time
ago. The world's changed, Kyle.

163
00:13:02,106 --> 00:13:05,769
Maybe it's time the public knew
the whole truth about Bob Rickman.

164
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:10,210
The public believes whatever I tell them.

165
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:13,441
I spent nine years honing my skill
while you hid in the woods...

166
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:15,643
...because you were afraid.

167
00:13:17,355 --> 00:13:21,018
Take my hand. See how afraid I am.

168
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,964
You've been warned.

169
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:44,648
Kyle, what are you doing here?

170
00:13:44,816 --> 00:13:47,011
I just registered a complaint.

171
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:50,215
What do you have against Rickman?

172
00:13:50,388 --> 00:13:53,255
There used to be a time when people
minded their own business.

173
00:13:53,424 --> 00:13:55,221
Hey, Tippett!

174
00:13:55,393 --> 00:13:57,156
-And what's your problem?
-You are.

175
00:13:57,328 --> 00:13:59,660
Touch Lana Lang again,
and I'll take care of you.

176
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:03,562
-Whitney, back off.
-I've got my eye on you.

177
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:07,331
-That's why I don't come into town.
-You want a ride home?

178
00:14:07,505 --> 00:14:08,767
Why are you being so nice?

179
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:11,771
You're not a bad guy.
You're just not a people person.

180
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:14,803
-What gave that away?
-You want a ride or not?

181
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,844
Yeah, I gotta stop and get groceries.

182
00:14:17,015 --> 00:14:19,074
No problem.

183
00:14:21,352 --> 00:14:23,183
Excuse me.

184
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:30,083
I'm sorry, I couldn't help overhearing. Are
you having a problem with Kyle Tippett?

185
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:31,853
Yeah, he attacked my girlfriend.

186
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,691
Bob Rickman.

187
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,393
Maybe I can help.

188
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,367
Thanks for the ride,
I really appreciate it.

189
00:14:46,544 --> 00:14:49,377
Next time, don't talk my ear off.

190
00:14:49,547 --> 00:14:52,380
Hey, why were you at Rickman's?

191
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,381
Why were you at Rickman's?

192
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:56,782
I heard a rumor he was trying
to buy our farm.

193
00:14:56,955 --> 00:14:59,389
Stay away from him.

194
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,893
Do you miss it? Regular life, I mean?

195
00:15:04,896 --> 00:15:08,388
Some people weren't meant to have
a regular life, Clark.

196
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,300
Thanks.

197
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:14,064
Bye.

198
00:15:41,432 --> 00:15:43,093
Whitney.

199
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:41,987
They're booking Kyle for assault.

200
00:16:42,493 --> 00:16:45,155
All right, what happened, guys?

201
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:49,732
I saw Kyle in town. He blew me off,
so I came out here to talk.

202
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:52,165
You drove out here in the middle
of the night?

203
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,970
Yeah. I had a feeling
he was gonna attack Lana again.

204
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,575
Next thing I know,
he attacks me with a bat.

205
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:01,735
Is that what happened?

206
00:17:01,913 --> 00:17:04,143
I did see Kyle swing at Whitney, but....

207
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:07,007
But what?

208
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:10,516
Kyle says Whitney swung at him first.

209
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:12,349
That's crazy. Why would I do that?

210
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:14,991
I don't know. None of this
makes any sense.

211
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,959
Yes, it does. First he attacks Lana,
then he comes after me.

212
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,189
-The guy needs to be locked up!
-We've all had a rough night.

213
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:24,766
-Just calm down.
-You saw it with your own eyes.

214
00:17:24,936 --> 00:17:29,100
That freak tried to kill me!
Now you're saying it's my fault?

215
00:17:40,718 --> 00:17:44,950
He's been a hermit for years, and suddenly
he's one of Smallville's most wanted.

216
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:48,422
-Something must have made him snap.
-I think it's Bob Rickman.

217
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:51,289
Yeah, but what does our rural Rodin
have against Rickman...

218
00:17:51,462 --> 00:17:54,226
...other than the obvious
poisoning-the-environment angle?

219
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:57,629
I don't know. Could you do some digging,
find a connection?

220
00:17:57,802 --> 00:18:01,135
Yeah, absolutely.
Sounds like an interesting story.

221
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:03,865
Tree-hugging hermit versus
pesticide tycoon.

222
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:09,875
-What do you think they have in common?
-Definitely not their grooming habits.

223
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:13,641
Lana.

224
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:16,681
Hey, what's wrong?

225
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:19,316
Can you give us a minute?

226
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,583
Yeah.

227
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:28,829
Whitney said you accused him
of attacking Kyle.

228
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,025
I didn't accuse him.
I have some questions.

229
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:33,260
-Like what?
-Like why was he there?

230
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:35,405
He was just trying to talk to him.

231
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,905
We both know Whitney can be
a little overzealous...

232
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,509
...but his heart's in the right place.

233
00:18:40,678 --> 00:18:43,670
I just don't think Kyle would do that.
He doesn't seem violent.

234
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:46,074
You can tell from knowing him
for two days?

235
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:49,448
He's lived in the woods alone for 10 years.

236
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,781
But that makes him odd, not dangerous.

237
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:53,924
Whitney wouldn't attack anybody.

238
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:55,955
He strung me up in a field.

239
00:18:59,197 --> 00:19:02,724
So that's what this is about?
You haven't forgiven him.

240
00:19:04,035 --> 00:19:07,027
Lana, I just think there's
something else going on here.

241
00:19:07,205 --> 00:19:10,732
Yeah, there is. You're looking for
an excuse to knock Whitney.

242
00:19:11,642 --> 00:19:14,270
You know what he's going through
right now with his dad.

243
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:19,374
If you don't like him, just say it.
Don't pretend to be his friend.

244
00:19:38,336 --> 00:19:40,998
You know, a barn's no place
for shoes like that.

245
00:19:41,172 --> 00:19:43,140
Didn't like them that much anyway.

246
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:45,667
Bob Rickman, Rickman Industries.

247
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:47,902
I know who you are.

248
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:52,272
You probably know why I'm here.

249
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:57,778
I hear you're interested in this farm,
and you're a very persuasive fellow.

250
00:19:57,955 --> 00:20:01,948
I gotta tell you, there's not a snowball's
chance in hell I'd consider selling...

251
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:04,754
...especially not to Rickman Industries.

252
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,588
You got a problem with progress?

253
00:20:07,765 --> 00:20:11,360
I'm skeptical about anybody who thinks
they can solve my problems with money.

254
00:20:11,535 --> 00:20:13,093
Why is that?

255
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:17,799
Well, because if I was interested
in money, I wouldn't be a farmer, would I?

256
00:20:17,975 --> 00:20:20,205
If you'll excuse me, I got
some real work to do.

257
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:35,051
-What happened? You all right?
-Oh, I think I twisted my ankle.

258
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:38,960
I guess you were right about these shoes.

259
00:20:39,897 --> 00:20:42,627
Could you give me a hand?

260
00:21:19,937 --> 00:21:23,373
Now, are you sure I can't convince you
to change your mind?

261
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:29,678
How could you do this without telling me?
What happened to "This land is our legacy"?

262
00:21:29,847 --> 00:21:33,783
-What's going on, guys?
-Your father sold the farm to Bob Rickman.

263
00:21:34,018 --> 00:21:37,112
What? How?

264
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:41,384
One minute I'm telling him he doesn't stand
a chance. The next, I got a signed contract.

265
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:45,290
I called our lawyer. He said he can't do
anything until he sees the contract...

266
00:21:45,463 --> 00:21:48,864
...but the devil-made-me-do-it argument
wouldn't hold up in court.

267
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:51,524
-Just can't believe I did this.
-What did Rickman do?

268
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:54,133
He made his case, he shook my hand.
That was it.

269
00:21:54,305 --> 00:21:57,706
-It can't be that easy.
-How else do you explain my signature?

270
00:22:00,978 --> 00:22:02,809
-I know someone who can help.
-No!

271
00:22:03,214 --> 00:22:05,375
I will not owe Lex Luthor anything,
thank you.

272
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:08,712
Right now, you don't have
anything to owe.

273
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:22,155
So, what time are you working
at the store tomorrow?

274
00:22:28,672 --> 00:22:31,835
Ouch. What's that all about?

275
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:35,536
I won't cave on my opinion of Kyle Tippett.
It put me on the outs with Lana.

276
00:22:35,846 --> 00:22:38,110
So you're Atticus.

277
00:22:38,282 --> 00:22:40,512
<i>Atticus Finch, To Kill a Mockingbird?</i>

278
00:22:40,684 --> 00:22:42,675
-Never read it.
-You should.

279
00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:46,516
You two have a lot in common.
Small-town heroes, believe in the truth...

280
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,681
...not willing to back down.

281
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:50,190
How's it end?

282
00:22:50,361 --> 00:22:53,524
It's not about the ending.
It's about the journey.

283
00:22:57,368 --> 00:23:00,997
What kills me is that I know I'm right.
I just wish I could get them to see it.

284
00:23:01,272 --> 00:23:03,604
That, my friend, is the key to leadership...

285
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:06,038
...knowing you're right
and convincing everyone.

286
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,872
If you can do that, the world's your oyster.

287
00:23:09,046 --> 00:23:11,708
Right now, I'd settle for getting
our farm back.

288
00:23:11,882 --> 00:23:15,374
The good news is,
the deal's three times market value.

289
00:23:15,553 --> 00:23:19,512
The bad news is, it's ironclad,
meaning it'll take a dozen extra lawyers.

290
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:22,048
Fortunately, I've got an army of them.

291
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,995
For once I think my parents will be glad
for your help.

292
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,854
I wonder what Rickman said
to convince your father.

293
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:32,525
I know the farm's in debt, but he'll pave
it and turn it into a wasteland...

294
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,568
...hardly better than the offers I made.

295
00:23:34,738 --> 00:23:37,298
I just know my father
would never sell the farm.

296
00:23:37,475 --> 00:23:40,967
Except that he did. Rickman's known
for getting past people's defenses...

297
00:23:41,145 --> 00:23:45,241
...but that's just good business. Unless
you think there's more to it than that.

298
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,083
Where are you going?

299
00:23:53,257 --> 00:23:54,485
Jail.

300
00:23:59,763 --> 00:24:02,664
Got a call you had a problem,
Mr. Rickman.

301
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:06,098
Yes, thank you for coming by, deputy.

302
00:24:06,437 --> 00:24:08,496
No problem.

303
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:15,510
I need you to take care of an old friend.

304
00:24:26,524 --> 00:24:31,291
Let's go, on your feet.
You have a visitor here.

305
00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:49,302
Kyle!

306
00:24:54,718 --> 00:24:55,742
No!

307
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,591
How bad?

308
00:25:41,765 --> 00:25:46,702
It's no worse than when Ozzy snorted
that row of fire ants down in Queensland.

309
00:25:47,771 --> 00:25:49,238
Is this guy really a doctor?

310
00:25:49,873 --> 00:25:53,604
He was. Now he's more
of an on-call specialist.

311
00:25:53,777 --> 00:25:56,803
You know, actors, rock stars,
billionaires' sons.

312
00:25:57,214 --> 00:25:59,148
-How do you know him?
-Long story.

313
00:25:59,316 --> 00:26:01,716
What's a guy gotta do
to get a drink around here?

314
00:26:01,885 --> 00:26:03,716
Finish sewing.

315
00:26:03,887 --> 00:26:08,051
Don't worry, Toby appreciates discretion.
Nobody will ever know Kyle was here.

316
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:09,385
Thanks.

317
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,825
I'm curious, why did you think
I'd be willing to harbor a fugitive?

318
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:17,891
My parents would freak, and if I took him
to a hospital, they'd put him back in jail.

319
00:26:18,068 --> 00:26:19,660
You're the only one I could trust.

320
00:26:19,837 --> 00:26:23,568
All in all, it's easier
than that knife wound of yours.

321
00:26:24,241 --> 00:26:28,507
Club Zero, remember that?
Blood all over my Mustang.

322
00:26:29,913 --> 00:26:33,974
-Can we talk to him now?
-I gave him something for the pain.

323
00:26:34,151 --> 00:26:36,915
It's lights out until the morning.

324
00:26:37,921 --> 00:26:39,980
My usual payment?

325
00:26:41,325 --> 00:26:44,158
Brown bag on my desk.

326
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:49,426
-See you, Toby.
-Lex.

327
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:51,598
You'd better get home. It's late.

328
00:26:55,606 --> 00:26:59,337
Hey, Atticus, you may want
to change your shirt.

329
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:24,464
Hi, Clark.

330
00:27:24,635 --> 00:27:27,798
You're the last person I expected
to find here.

331
00:27:28,205 --> 00:27:30,799
I heard Kyle Tippett escaped.
I was a little freaked out.

332
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:32,967
He's not coming after anybody.

333
00:27:33,644 --> 00:27:36,010
-How do you know?
-I just do.

334
00:27:38,816 --> 00:27:40,545
I'm sorry I bothered you.

335
00:27:40,884 --> 00:27:44,980
If you were worried, why did you walk
all the way over here instead of calling?

336
00:27:46,557 --> 00:27:49,492
I don't know. I thought you
might've changed your opinion.

337
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,652
Well, if you came over for an apology,
you're out of luck.

338
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:57,267
Clark, he escaped from jail.
You have to admit it looks pretty bad.

339
00:27:57,434 --> 00:28:00,767
-You don't know the whole story.
-Then tell me. What is it?

340
00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:05,164
I don't know yet. You've already made up
your mind about him, so what do you care?

341
00:28:06,243 --> 00:28:10,077
I wanted to clear the air
and preserve our friendship...

342
00:28:10,247 --> 00:28:13,182
...but now I don't even know
why I bothered.

343
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,348
Here you go.

344
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:24,426
Thank you.

345
00:28:26,597 --> 00:28:28,758
Hello, Lex.

346
00:28:33,036 --> 00:28:36,028
<i>Oh, come on, Lex,
this Art of War stuff is for amateurs.</i>

347
00:28:36,273 --> 00:28:38,867
It's not that. I just don't like you.

348
00:28:44,615 --> 00:28:48,449
So my attorney tells me that my purchase
of the Kent farm is being challenged.

349
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:52,214
I warned you the Kents were
a tough nut to crack.

350
00:28:54,057 --> 00:28:58,619
I recognize LuthorCorp lawyers
when I see them. Why are you involved?

351
00:28:58,796 --> 00:29:02,288
Smallville's my home,
and the Kents are my friends.

352
00:29:06,737 --> 00:29:09,297
Well, with friends like you, Lex....

353
00:29:13,577 --> 00:29:15,977
Don't touch me.

354
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:20,948
Speaking of old friends,
I heard Kyle Tippett escaped from jail.

355
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:24,410
Now, why do you assume
we're old friends?

356
00:29:25,088 --> 00:29:26,453
Just a rumor.

357
00:29:27,257 --> 00:29:28,485
Have you seen him?

358
00:29:28,926 --> 00:29:33,158
I never met the man, but I'll be sure
to pass on your regards when I do.

359
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:40,936
How'd you get my dad
to sign that contract?

360
00:29:41,104 --> 00:29:43,334
Oh, you must be the Kent boy.

361
00:29:43,507 --> 00:29:47,034
I'm a good businessman.
No hard feelings?

362
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:15,299
I spent the morning delving into
the exotic world of agriculture equipment...

363
00:30:15,472 --> 00:30:18,498
...and it seems that Kyle and Rickman
were partners in the '80s.

364
00:30:18,675 --> 00:30:20,336
-They sold farm equipment?
-Yeah...

365
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,775
...they were salesmen of the year
three years running, '89, '90, '91.

366
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,246
<i>The next year, Rickman started
his own company, and Kyle went Walden.</i>

367
00:30:27,718 --> 00:30:29,583
-I wonder what happened?
-I don't know...

368
00:30:29,753 --> 00:30:32,221
<i>...but I found this story
in the Smallville Ledger.</i>

369
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:34,152
"Salesmen trapped in car
after meteor shower."

370
00:30:34,324 --> 00:30:38,055
I'm guessing whatever's going on started
that sunny October day, 12 years ago.

371
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:41,229
-Let's go ask him.
-Wait, you know where he is?

372
00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:53,768
Where's Kyle?

373
00:30:54,578 --> 00:30:56,512
Who?

374
00:30:57,681 --> 00:31:00,514
I think I know where he went.

375
00:31:14,197 --> 00:31:16,256
I appreciate the help,
but I'm done here.

376
00:31:16,433 --> 00:31:19,197
-We know Rickman was your partner.
-It was a million years ago.

377
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:21,701
What happened to you guys
in that meteor shower?

378
00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:25,273
Trust me, you're not the only ones
that were affected by it.

379
00:31:25,442 --> 00:31:29,276
What's going on with you and Rickman?
How did he get my dad to sell our farm?

380
00:31:32,382 --> 00:31:36,716
You know, until that day, we were the
worst salesmen to ever carry a catalog.

381
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:39,481
All that changed after they
pulled us out of that car.

382
00:31:39,656 --> 00:31:43,183
With a handshake we could get people
to do whatever we wanted them to do...

383
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,794
...buy a tractor, stand on one leg.

384
00:31:45,963 --> 00:31:47,760
You had the power of persuasion?

385
00:31:47,931 --> 00:31:48,989
How long does it last?

386
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:51,225
Until the person does
what I tell them to do.

387
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:54,564
It could be two minutes, two hours.

388
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:56,729
Then they come out of it
without a memory.

389
00:31:56,907 --> 00:31:58,465
What happens if they can't do it?

390
00:31:58,642 --> 00:32:02,942
They keep trying unless they're forcibly
snapped out of it, like your friend Whitney.

391
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,674
Well, it sounds good in theory,
but how about you prove it?

392
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:07,839
-Chloe.
-What?

393
00:32:08,018 --> 00:32:09,645
The guy lives in a crappy trailer.

394
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,812
If he has this power, he'd use it
to sell these sculptures.

395
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,254
It's dangerous.

396
00:32:15,592 --> 00:32:18,152
I'm used to living on the edge.

397
00:32:32,275 --> 00:32:37,542
You have feelings for Clark, don't you,
Chloe? You see him, and you want him.

398
00:32:37,714 --> 00:32:43,152
All this time, you've been hiding it.
Now you can show him.

399
00:33:06,476 --> 00:33:08,637
Okay, come on, I'm ready.

400
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,242
What? Why are you looking
at me like that?

401
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,687
And why is my mouth minty?

402
00:33:20,891 --> 00:33:23,189
Let's just say he proved his point.

403
00:33:24,995 --> 00:33:27,020
Oh, God, did I just...?

404
00:33:27,564 --> 00:33:30,431
Don't worry, it was fine.

405
00:33:31,701 --> 00:33:36,229
Well, now that the party trick's over,
I gotta hit the road.

406
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:40,669
Wait, you have these gifts,
but you hid in the woods. Why?

407
00:33:40,844 --> 00:33:43,677
Because I was scared
that I wouldn't be able to control it...

408
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:46,748
-...and I'd wind up like Bob.
-What happened between you two?

409
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:50,318
-Why does he want to kill you?
-He knows that I know his secret...

410
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:53,183
...and I threatened to expose him
if he built a plant here.

411
00:33:53,356 --> 00:33:56,348
Yeah, but he's been destroying
communities like this for years.

412
00:33:56,526 --> 00:33:59,791
-How come you let him get away with it?
-I wanted to be left alone!

413
00:33:59,963 --> 00:34:03,865
-lf it wasn't here, it wasn't my problem.
-My dad lost our farm because of you.

414
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,193
Do you know what it's like to have
to hide because of who you are?

415
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,270
Yes, I do.

416
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:13,603
But when you have a gift, you can't just
hide in a hole and hope it goes away.

417
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,312
How did you get in?

418
00:34:21,718 --> 00:34:25,119
Oh, your guard at the front gate
let me through. He's a great guy.

419
00:34:25,288 --> 00:34:27,119
I didn't realize we had a meeting.

420
00:34:27,457 --> 00:34:30,221
We don't. I come with an olive branch.

421
00:34:30,794 --> 00:34:32,921
You can call off your lawyers.

422
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:36,099
I'm dropping the Kent farm
as a proposed site.

423
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,130
What's the matter? Losing your touch?

424
00:34:42,906 --> 00:34:46,899
No, I've just decided Smallville
really isn't worth the hassle.

425
00:34:47,177 --> 00:34:49,805
At least I know where I'm not wanted.

426
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,347
Okay, then. Thanks for stopping by.

427
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:57,916
Well, since you won,
how about it? Truce?

428
00:35:15,172 --> 00:35:17,663
-Hello?
-Lex, it's me.

429
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:19,502
What's going on?

430
00:35:19,676 --> 00:35:22,338
I'm with Kyle. He wants to go public
about Rickman.

431
00:35:22,512 --> 00:35:25,345
No kidding? What does he know?

432
00:35:25,515 --> 00:35:27,176
Enough to bring him down.

433
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:30,717
All right, I'm coming to pick you up.
Where are you?

434
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:50,462
<i>I called friends at the Planet
and the Inquisitor.</i>

435
00:35:50,707 --> 00:35:52,868
Would you be willing to talk to them?

436
00:35:53,043 --> 00:35:54,635
I'll do what I have to to stop him.

437
00:35:55,378 --> 00:35:58,575
Get in. I have to fill up
if we're going to Metropolis.

438
00:35:59,149 --> 00:36:00,377
Thanks, Lex.

439
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,991
Lex?

440
00:36:25,075 --> 00:36:27,270
What's going on?

441
00:36:35,852 --> 00:36:37,945
Rickman's got to him!

442
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:11,612
Clark, you have some explaining to do.

443
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:24,966
What just happened?

444
00:37:25,135 --> 00:37:27,000
I have my suspicions.

445
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,570
I hate to think that you failed
to get the job done.

446
00:37:29,739 --> 00:37:34,233
Relax, failing isn't something I do.

447
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:40,413
Just in case.

448
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:03,163
I always knew you were keeping
secrets from me, Clark.

449
00:38:04,174 --> 00:38:07,666
But I never thought they were this good.

450
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:24,693
Clark, you know that guy
you're trying to protect?

451
00:38:24,861 --> 00:38:26,351
I'm gonna shoot him now.

452
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,029
Lex.

453
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:31,531
There you are.

454
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,165
Don't do this. I'm your friend.

455
00:38:36,339 --> 00:38:41,709
Oh, please. You think I don't see
the way your parents look at me...

456
00:38:41,878 --> 00:38:46,372
...the way half the town looks at me?
You're no different.

457
00:38:46,649 --> 00:38:51,916
Friendship's a fairy tale, Clark. Respect
and fear are the best you can hope for.

458
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:54,248
-Rickman's doing this to you.
-What if he did?

459
00:38:54,424 --> 00:38:57,825
-You hate Rickman.
-You can learn a lot from someone you hate.

460
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:05,289
Hello, Bob.

461
00:40:12,402 --> 00:40:13,391
Lex!

462
00:40:25,482 --> 00:40:27,074
I always was the better salesman.

463
00:40:30,086 --> 00:40:31,110
Are you okay?

464
00:40:35,091 --> 00:40:37,082
I saw you get shot, Clark.

465
00:40:38,928 --> 00:40:42,796
Don't worry. Just don't hide
in the woods like I did.

466
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:47,596
You got a gift.
Use it to do great things.

467
00:40:48,338 --> 00:40:50,363
I think I'll do the same with mine.

468
00:40:55,345 --> 00:40:57,870
I can't believe each one
of these bruises was a bullet.

469
00:40:58,448 --> 00:41:00,541
-Sorry.
-Guess that answers that question.

470
00:41:02,118 --> 00:41:05,849
It's weird. I get shot at,
and the bullets are fired by my best friend.

471
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:11,359
-What do you think happened to Kyle?
-I don't know...

472
00:41:11,528 --> 00:41:14,964
...but I think he's out in the world
trying to make a difference now.

473
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,633
Hi, I hope I'm not interrupting.

474
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,131
No, come on in.

475
00:41:25,074 --> 00:41:27,542
We'll be outside.

476
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,710
I didn't know if we were still talking.

477
00:41:34,817 --> 00:41:38,309
I'm not sure what happened with Kyle,
and it's really not important...

478
00:41:38,488 --> 00:41:42,652
...because I think our friendship
is worth more than one argument.

479
00:41:42,825 --> 00:41:44,918
Yeah, me too.

480
00:41:48,164 --> 00:41:50,655
You know, I thought
we were done there for a while.

481
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:53,666
You and me are gonna be friends
for a very long time.

482
00:41:53,836 --> 00:41:57,499
We may have our ups and downs,
but that's just the way it works.

483
00:42:01,244 --> 00:42:03,371
Did Chloe really kiss you?

484
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,097
Clark.

485
00:42:22,265 --> 00:42:23,755
Hey.

486
00:42:23,933 --> 00:42:30,202
Tell your dad I spoke to my lawyers.
Because of Rickman's untimely demise...

487
00:42:30,373 --> 00:42:33,604
...they're not expanding.
They ripped up the contract.

488
00:42:33,776 --> 00:42:36,370
-Thanks.
-Hey, what are friends for?

489
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,280
How're you feeling?

490
00:42:39,449 --> 00:42:43,613
I still don't remember what happened.
Are you sure I didn't hurt you?

491
00:42:48,057 --> 00:42:50,651
I wonder where Kyle is now?

492
00:42:54,297 --> 00:42:56,288
I don't know.

493
00:42:56,466 --> 00:43:00,459
It's still strange to think he and Rickman
were once best friends.

494
00:43:02,405 --> 00:43:04,965
Think we'll ever end up like that?

495
