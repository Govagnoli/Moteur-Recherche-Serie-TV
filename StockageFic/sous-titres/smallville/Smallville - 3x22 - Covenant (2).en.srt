1
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:49,202
Hello, Clark.

2
00:01:50,174 --> 00:01:52,142
My name is Kara.

3
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,534
I'm from Krypton.

4
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:52,095
Kara, I don't know where you heard
about Krypton...

5
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:54,931
...but an astronomer told me
that planet was destroyed.

6
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:57,232
Its physical form is gone...

7
00:02:57,407 --> 00:02:59,068
...but it still lives on through us.

8
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,509
Here, this will warm you up.

9
00:03:07,484 --> 00:03:09,042
It's hot tea.

10
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:13,586
Young lady...

11
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:17,259
...your parents must be worried.
Why don't you let us call them.

12
00:03:17,427 --> 00:03:18,689
There's no one to call.

13
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:22,025
Well, you can't sleep out in the field.
You'll stay with us tonight.

14
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:25,835
Thank you. I heard you were very kind.

15
00:03:26,937 --> 00:03:28,529
How exactly did you get here?

16
00:03:28,906 --> 00:03:30,965
I came through a passage in the cave wall.

17
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:34,270
A passage from where?

18
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:38,075
A place where all your questions
will be answered.

19
00:03:39,216 --> 00:03:41,343
Where you don't have to hide
your true self.

20
00:03:41,518 --> 00:03:45,887
Look, if you really are from some distant
planet, why don't you us a favor, huh?

21
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:48,689
Give us a display
of all of your special abilities.

22
00:03:50,294 --> 00:03:51,659
-Dad--
-Clark...

23
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:56,063
...you told me yourself that Pete's
being harassed by the FBl.

24
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,394
How do we know
that this isn't just some ploy?

25
00:03:59,403 --> 00:04:03,499
Jonathan Kent, you have no place
in this conversation.

26
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,942
I will show Kal-El
all he needs to see in due time.

27
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:09,872
Where did you hear that name?

28
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:14,978
It was given to you at birth.

29
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:17,516
Why are you here?

30
00:04:20,357 --> 00:04:21,881
To take you home.

31
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:27,556
Clark?

32
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:29,360
Lex.

33
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:33,027
-Hey, do you have a second?
-This is...

34
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:41,805
...good a time as any.

35
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:59,657
I thought you'd be out celebrating.
Your dad's finally behind bars.

36
00:04:59,963 --> 00:05:03,160
My father has a battalion of lawyers
more powerful than Caesar's army.

37
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,426
He'll be out on bail
in less than 48 hours.

38
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:09,099
I don't think the judge is gonna
let a murderer out on the street.

39
00:05:09,272 --> 00:05:12,673
The only way he'll be denied bail
is if there's evidence at his hearing...

40
00:05:12,843 --> 00:05:16,108
-...he's an imminent threat to society.
-What about Chloe's voice mail?

41
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:19,180
The one with your dad's confession on it?
That can be damaging.

42
00:05:19,383 --> 00:05:21,613
It will be, for the grand jury.

43
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:25,020
But in order to deny him bail,
they need eyewitnesses.

44
00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:27,656
People who've seen my father
actually inflict harm.

45
00:05:27,991 --> 00:05:30,926
Unfortunately, anyone who's been privy
to his darkest moments...

46
00:05:31,094 --> 00:05:33,562
...is either dead
or unwilling to come forward.

47
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:37,529
I'll come forward.

48
00:05:38,402 --> 00:05:42,099
I appreciate the support, Clark,
but they need an eyewitness.

49
00:05:42,606 --> 00:05:44,130
I saw him at Belle Reve.

50
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:50,168
I saw him order the doctor
to increase your electroshock voltage...

51
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:54,808
...even when the doctor said
it could turn you into a vegetable.

52
00:05:57,821 --> 00:05:59,288
How could you have seen that?

53
00:06:01,558 --> 00:06:03,253
I snuck in to try to save you...

54
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:05,693
...but I was too late.

55
00:06:07,898 --> 00:06:11,356
You knew all along my father murdered
his parents, didn't you?

56
00:06:12,736 --> 00:06:13,896
And you never told me.

57
00:06:14,071 --> 00:06:16,539
-Lex--
-I assumed there was an agreement...

58
00:06:16,707 --> 00:06:19,301
...among friends to share that kind
of information.

59
00:06:19,476 --> 00:06:21,410
Not when it can get your friend killed.

60
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:27,445
Lex, your father threw you in
a mental institution and fried your brain.

61
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:29,748
If you found that out all over again...

62
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,582
...I thought he'd kill you.
And I couldn't live with that.

63
00:06:41,498 --> 00:06:43,090
You're a good friend, Clark.

64
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:46,932
If you tell the judge
what you just told me...

65
00:06:48,138 --> 00:06:51,767
...my father will be exchanging his Armani
for an orange jumpsuit.

66
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:56,074
I'll be there. You can count on it.

67
00:06:59,983 --> 00:07:02,178
Six-one, clear. Opening up.

68
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,852
I thought we had a deal, Loder.

69
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:09,651
I tipped you off on Lex's wire...

70
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:12,818
...I made sure discriminating
recordings disappeared...

71
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:15,521
...I can't control a bleached blond,
Pulitzer-wannabe...

72
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:18,259
...from dredging up evidence
for a decades-old homicide.

73
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:22,160
And our other investigation? Lex's
friend? What's the status of that?

74
00:07:23,507 --> 00:07:24,940
You're a piece of work.

75
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:28,669
In case you haven't noticed, you're a hop,
skip and a jump from death row...

76
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:32,344
...and no hick farm kid's secret's gonna
be able to save your ass.

77
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:35,610
This is an inconvenience.
I'll be out on bail in a couple of hours.

78
00:07:35,786 --> 00:07:39,654
Then I expect you to send me the
information you've gathered on Clark Kent.

79
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,515
You can expect to be waiting
for a very long time.

80
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:45,427
Our deal's over, Mr. Luthor.

81
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:49,932
You're venturing into
dangerous waters, Loder.

82
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:53,559
I'm a pretty decent swimmer.
Night-night.

83
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:57,636
Opening 6-1.

84
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:07,174
You shouldn't involve yourself
in their problems.

85
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:12,611
-Lex is my friend. I want to help him.
-You can't trust him.

86
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,780
You don't know him.

87
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:16,420
I don't have to.

88
00:08:17,093 --> 00:08:19,288
It's human nature.
It's just who they are.

89
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:21,788
They happen to be the people I care about.

90
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:25,196
Which is why it will be that much harder
when they all betray you.

91
00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:28,163
I can understand why you're scared.

92
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,706
This is all you know.

93
00:08:33,577 --> 00:08:36,137
But you're not meant
for this world, Kal-El.

94
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:38,713
You were meant for mine.

95
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:41,116
My name's Clark.

96
00:08:42,485 --> 00:08:45,648
-Why should I believe anything you say?
-Because it's the truth.

97
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:47,251
Really?

98
00:08:47,457 --> 00:08:50,949
Why don't you start by telling me
where you've been for the last 1 4 years?

99
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:53,924
If you join me...

100
00:08:54,598 --> 00:08:56,498
...all your questions will be answered.

101
00:08:59,002 --> 00:09:00,560
That's not good enough.

102
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:04,298
Kal-El, wait.

103
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:07,040
Come with me.

104
00:09:25,061 --> 00:09:28,189
-How are you doing this?
-You're doing it too.

105
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,428
I can't fly.

106
00:09:32,435 --> 00:09:33,697
Not yet.

107
00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:36,530
This is just the beginning, Kal-El.

108
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:41,909
You have no idea
how powerful you'll become.

109
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:53,489
This fissure wasn't here last week.

110
00:09:53,957 --> 00:09:55,652
It opened to release me.

111
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,256
It'll open again when we go.

112
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:02,189
What makes you think
I don't like this world?

113
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,925
I can sense how sad you are, Kal-El.

114
00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:09,197
Not a day goes by where you don't
feel like an outsider.

115
00:10:09,973 --> 00:10:14,376
Even those closest to you will never
truly understand you.

116
00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:20,179
But it doesn't have to be that way.

117
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:29,088
You've been down here
ever since the meteor shower?

118
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:30,419
Yes.

119
00:10:30,593 --> 00:10:33,084
Waiting for the time
when he knew you'd be ready.

120
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:34,423
He?

121
00:10:34,597 --> 00:10:35,757
Your birth father.

122
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,630
Jor-El.

123
00:10:38,568 --> 00:10:41,503
-He died in Krypton.
-Yes...

124
00:10:41,972 --> 00:10:44,941
...but his spirit and will live on
inside these walls.

125
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:49,343
I should've known.

126
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:53,643
He's not the monster that you imagine.

127
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:56,351
He saved your life.

128
00:10:58,254 --> 00:11:00,484
To turn me into something
I never wanted to be.

129
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:02,852
You may think you know your destiny...

130
00:11:03,526 --> 00:11:06,154
...but you've no idea what greatness
lies ahead of you.

131
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,463
Then why don't you tell me?

132
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:13,559
I'm only here to help your transition.

133
00:11:15,605 --> 00:11:18,039
Everything that you want to know...

134
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:20,502
...Iies through there.

135
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:23,775
But it has to be your choice.

136
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:33,080
Come with me, Kal-El.

137
00:11:37,193 --> 00:11:38,956
I can't do this.

138
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:44,398
Just know...

139
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:46,529
...when you're ready...

140
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:48,664
...I'll be waiting for you.

141
00:12:04,454 --> 00:12:06,684
Orange is a good color for you, Dad...

142
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:12,126
...although it might get a little old
after 25 to life.

143
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:14,855
I didn't ask you here to trade insults.

144
00:12:21,704 --> 00:12:23,604
No matter how wide...

145
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:28,202
...the chasm gets between us, son...

146
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:32,574
...I'm your father. I'll always be your father.

147
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:35,684
And the devil that's haunted me
since the day I was born.

148
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,479
Lex, this is not easy for me.

149
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:44,791
As a father...

150
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:46,827
...I....

151
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:51,662
I have failed you.

152
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:54,863
I realize that now.

153
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:56,533
And...

154
00:12:57,474 --> 00:12:58,805
...I'm sorry.

155
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:05,805
Two years ago I was diagnosed with a....

156
00:13:06,382 --> 00:13:10,113
A degenerative liver disease.

157
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:15,084
I've tried everything,
everything imaginable...

158
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:17,390
...but...

159
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:20,093
...there's nothing.

160
00:13:21,197 --> 00:13:22,528
It's too late.

161
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,463
No amount of money can save me.

162
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:34,968
Lex...

163
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:36,737
...please...

164
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:40,078
...don't let me die in prison.

165
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:01,765
Dad...

166
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:07,106
...this might have been more effective...

167
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:11,545
...if you had a string quartet in the corner
playing "Barber's Requiem."

168
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:18,317
I understand.

169
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:20,656
How could you trust me?

170
00:14:22,258 --> 00:14:24,522
I've asked my doctors...

171
00:14:24,894 --> 00:14:28,830
...to release my medical files to you.
You can see for yourself.

172
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,751
She hasn't eaten anything
since she's been here.

173
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:02,261
Martha, her appetite
is the least of our problems.

174
00:15:02,432 --> 00:15:04,229
I think she's for real.

175
00:15:04,534 --> 00:15:05,831
I think Jor-El sent her.

176
00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:08,493
-Are you sure?
-How else can we explain her powers?

177
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:12,004
This is Smallville. Kryptonite's given
a lot of people special abilities.

178
00:15:12,175 --> 00:15:14,575
She knows my birth name.
She knows everything.

179
00:15:14,744 --> 00:15:17,975
She doesn't know anything more
about you than Dr. Swann.

180
00:15:18,147 --> 00:15:21,139
-Do you think Swann sent Kara?
-I've no idea what his agenda is.

181
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:23,979
But wherever this girl is from,
I don't trust her.

182
00:15:24,153 --> 00:15:27,213
You're the one who cannot be trusted,
Jonathan Kent.

183
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,085
You broke the covenant.

184
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,456
Jor-El gave you many warnings,
but you chose not to listen to them.

185
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,393
What is she talking about, Jonathan?

186
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,158
Tell Kal-El what you did.

187
00:15:40,903 --> 00:15:42,564
What kind of deal did you make, Dad?

188
00:15:47,777 --> 00:15:50,871
I promised Jor-El
that if he gave me the power...

189
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,207
...to bring you back from Metropolis...

190
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:57,680
...that one day I'd return you to him.

191
00:15:57,854 --> 00:15:59,719
Jonathan, you didn't do that.

192
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:02,653
-I had no idea it was gonna be this soon.
-No.

193
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:05,794
I told you, Kal-El.
They'll always betray you.

194
00:16:06,896 --> 00:16:08,659
Even the man you call your father.

195
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:10,958
-I did not betray my son.
-Quiet.

196
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,633
Someone's listening.

197
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:17,636
What are you talking about?

198
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,077
How'd you do that?

199
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,421
Who are you?

200
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:40,860
Get out of my way!

201
00:16:55,845 --> 00:16:57,369
What did you do to him?

202
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,805
That man feared you, Kal-El.

203
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,544
-He wanted to exploit you.
-So you killed him?

204
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:07,022
He didn't feel any pain.

205
00:17:12,962 --> 00:17:16,398
She killed a man, Jonathan.
We have to call the sheriff.

206
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:20,627
What are we gonna tell the sheriff? A
Kryptonian girl vaporized a federal agent?

207
00:17:21,237 --> 00:17:24,172
-What have you invited into our lives?
-Martha...

208
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:27,267
...I don't believe l
had another choice.

209
00:17:27,443 --> 00:17:30,640
How could you have made that decision
without talking to me?

210
00:17:30,813 --> 00:17:32,974
It was the only way
that I could get him back.

211
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:37,617
Why would you keep it a secret?

212
00:17:39,756 --> 00:17:42,623
I didn't want you to have to wait
for the rest of your life...

213
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:45,226
...worrying about something
that might never happen.

214
00:17:45,395 --> 00:17:48,922
Do you really think Jor-El
will ever give up on Clark?

215
00:17:49,098 --> 00:17:51,089
I can't sit idly by while he takes our son.

216
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:56,034
We might not have a choice.
That girl is more powerful than Clark.

217
00:18:08,351 --> 00:18:12,185
-Mr. Kent?
-So this is the legendary Torch.

218
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:15,085
Yeah. A little less glamorous
than you imagined, huh?

219
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:19,018
If you're looking for Clark,
I haven't seen a trace of him.

220
00:18:20,963 --> 00:18:22,191
I was looking for you.

221
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:26,527
Something's telling me you're not
throwing a tea party.

222
00:18:26,702 --> 00:18:29,933
I understand that you're very good
at getting to the bottom of things.

223
00:18:30,973 --> 00:18:32,702
Do you think you could...

224
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,366
...run the fingerprints
off of this for me?

225
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:37,477
No problem.

226
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,480
Is there a name that's attached
to the fingerprints?

227
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,584
That's what I need to find out, Chloe.

228
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:45,516
I need the identity of the last person
to touch that cup.

229
00:18:47,223 --> 00:18:48,588
Okay.

230
00:18:48,758 --> 00:18:51,852
If I could get a little more info
on this mystery, it might help-

231
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:55,225
Chloe, as a personal favor to me,
please don't press the issue.

232
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:58,557
Okay. Yeah.

233
00:18:59,202 --> 00:19:00,601
I'll call my guy right now.

234
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:03,536
Thank you.

235
00:19:07,577 --> 00:19:09,044
It's gonna take a little while.

236
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,942
Of course.

237
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:27,722
I thought you'd be packing.

238
00:19:27,897 --> 00:19:31,890
Well, if I squeeze anything else into
my suitcases, I think they'd explode.

239
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,732
So when are you taking off?

240
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:38,439
Well, I have to be at the airport
by noon tomorrow.

241
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:42,268
That's sort of why I'm here.

242
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:47,874
I was wondering if you would mind
being my SuperShuttle.

243
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:50,051
Sure.

244
00:19:51,821 --> 00:19:53,846
I know it's been a strange year...

245
00:19:54,023 --> 00:19:57,356
...but I hate leaving with the feeling
things aren't settled between us.

246
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:02,961
-Lana, when I said I want you to be happy-
-When you invited me over...

247
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:07,364
...and you had something important
to tell me, that wasn't it, was it?

248
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:14,006
Clark, if you have something to say to me,
say it before I'm gone.

249
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:25,946
-Lana....
-Who's that?

250
00:20:33,563 --> 00:20:34,825
My cousin.

251
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:39,064
You've never mentioned her before.

252
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:41,264
Where's she from?

253
00:20:42,204 --> 00:20:44,638
Far away. California.

254
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,442
Well, you know, if you--
If you've got company, I should--

255
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:50,875
-I should find a ride from someone else.
-Lana.

256
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:55,680
Even though it's gonna be hard to see
you go, I wanna be there for you.

257
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:07,127
We'll talk in the car? Tomorrow?

258
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,305
She really does love you.

259
00:21:23,613 --> 00:21:25,478
But it's not meant to be.
You know that.

260
00:21:25,648 --> 00:21:27,275
No one knows what's meant to be.

261
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:30,342
Not you, not even Jor-El.

262
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:34,249
Don't let it upset you, Kal-El.

263
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:38,186
What you share with Lana
is an earthly love...

264
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:42,096
...filled with doubts,
and pain and sorrow.

265
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:47,695
The love between us will be stronger
than anything you can imagine.

266
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:51,466
You and I are the only ones left, Kal-El.

267
00:21:53,142 --> 00:21:56,236
We're the only ones
who can preserve the Kryptonian race.

268
00:21:58,681 --> 00:22:00,171
Come with me, Kal-El.

269
00:22:01,684 --> 00:22:03,015
Come home.

270
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,985
This is my home.

271
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:08,853
I know it seems that way...

272
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:15,763
...but sooner or later everyone you know
here will lie, betray or leave you.

273
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:19,292
No matter what you say...

274
00:22:19,902 --> 00:22:21,529
...I'll never go with you.

275
00:22:40,056 --> 00:22:41,785
Clark Kent?

276
00:22:43,893 --> 00:22:46,157
I have a package for you.

277
00:22:46,762 --> 00:22:48,024
Who's it from?

278
00:22:48,364 --> 00:22:50,229
A Mr. Lionel Luthor.

279
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:16,788
Johns Hopkins, the Mayo Clinic.

280
00:23:18,694 --> 00:23:20,286
My father's knocked on the door...

281
00:23:20,463 --> 00:23:23,626
...of every major medical institution
in the Western world...

282
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:26,267
...and was sent home each time
without a cure.

283
00:23:29,972 --> 00:23:32,566
I'm sensing you're having second thoughts.

284
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:35,570
Lex, I understand if you want to back out.

285
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:40,648
He needs to be punished for what he did,
but he's still your father and he's dying.

286
00:23:41,717 --> 00:23:43,207
Yeah...

287
00:23:43,385 --> 00:23:46,149
...and he's gonna draw his last
breath in prison...

288
00:23:46,322 --> 00:23:49,519
...not the VlP suite at Metropolis General.

289
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:53,721
But only if you're still willing
to go through with this.

290
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:56,894
I don't think I like the sound of this.

291
00:23:57,066 --> 00:23:58,363
Chloe....

292
00:23:59,235 --> 00:24:02,432
A dying man has little to lose.

293
00:24:03,272 --> 00:24:07,538
My father used a bizarre blood platelet
cocktail to raise the dead...

294
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,168
...then pinned the murders
of the research team on his son.

295
00:24:11,614 --> 00:24:15,050
Who knows what tactics he'll use
to avoid going to prison.

296
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:17,645
Yeah, but the FBl guaranteed our safety.

297
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,449
They're putting me and my father in
protective custody until after the trial.

298
00:24:21,624 --> 00:24:23,216
Then what?

299
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:27,756
-Lex, are you trying to scare me?
-I'm worried about you, Chloe.

300
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:31,491
I want you to have all the facts before
you walk into that courtroom.

301
00:24:35,404 --> 00:24:38,271
Your father's intimidated me long enough.

302
00:24:38,874 --> 00:24:40,967
I'm not backing down.

303
00:24:49,852 --> 00:24:51,513
What is this?

304
00:24:53,823 --> 00:24:55,120
A key.

305
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:58,551
Unfortunately not the one
we're both looking for.

306
00:24:58,727 --> 00:25:00,820
If you wanna play games, I'll leave.

307
00:25:00,996 --> 00:25:02,725
Clark....

308
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,961
My lawyers told me that your name has
appeared on the prosecution's witness list.

309
00:25:11,373 --> 00:25:13,841
I can only assume
that Lex has you buying...

310
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:18,036
...into his version of our Oedipal struggle.

311
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:21,047
I am a poor misguided....
Et cetera, et cetera.

312
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,050
Buy into this: You're a murderer.

313
00:25:25,588 --> 00:25:28,216
I didn't kill my parents, Clark.

314
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:31,848
I certainly didn't shed any tears
at their funeral.

315
00:25:32,027 --> 00:25:34,791
You have no idea what it's like
to grow up under...

316
00:25:34,964 --> 00:25:37,524
...the thumb of an abusive father...

317
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,228
...someone who'd stop at nothing
to establish absolute control over you.

318
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:44,201
Your son does.

319
00:25:44,373 --> 00:25:46,398
Lex is an expert by now.

320
00:25:47,276 --> 00:25:50,734
An expert at lies and subterfuge.

321
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,477
That key you're holding....

322
00:25:57,052 --> 00:25:58,917
It opens a door.

323
00:25:59,088 --> 00:26:02,489
Third floor, east wing, Luthor mansion.

324
00:26:03,926 --> 00:26:05,917
You'll be fascinated by what you find.

325
00:26:06,095 --> 00:26:08,222
I'm not walking into some kind of trap.

326
00:26:08,397 --> 00:26:11,298
Last time I listened to you,
I became a lab rat at Summerholt.

327
00:26:12,568 --> 00:26:14,263
Clark...

328
00:26:14,436 --> 00:26:16,427
...I don't wanna harm you.

329
00:26:16,605 --> 00:26:18,903
I want to enlighten you.

330
00:26:19,775 --> 00:26:23,541
You want answers?
You're gonna find them.

331
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:26,681
Answers you won't believe.

332
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,096
-Before you jump to conclusions--
-You said you stopped investigating me.

333
00:27:48,364 --> 00:27:51,492
-I did.
-You did? Then what is this?

334
00:27:54,136 --> 00:27:57,867
I understand how you could think
all this is about you...

335
00:27:59,141 --> 00:28:00,768
...but in fact it's about me.

336
00:28:02,044 --> 00:28:03,341
More lies.

337
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:10,841
So much of my own life I can't explain.

338
00:28:12,454 --> 00:28:17,687
I survived countless brushes with death,
and it all started with this car crash.

339
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:25,128
If I'm guilty of anything, it's that I inherited
my father's curiosity for the unexplained.

340
00:28:25,734 --> 00:28:27,725
You've inherited his dishonesty.

341
00:28:30,105 --> 00:28:33,472
Clark, look me in the eye and tell me
you don't have any hidden places...

342
00:28:33,642 --> 00:28:36,167
...where you keep deep, dark secrets.

343
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:42,847
Ever since I met you,
I've been defending you.

344
00:28:43,085 --> 00:28:46,213
Making excuses for you
to people like Pete, like my parents...

345
00:28:46,722 --> 00:28:49,589
...telling them, "You can trust Lex Luthor,
he's a good guy.

346
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:53,759
He's nothing like his father."

347
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,562
I was wrong.

348
00:29:00,436 --> 00:29:02,028
Clark....

349
00:29:11,213 --> 00:29:15,343
I can't believe he pretended to be my friend
for three years just to investigate me.

350
00:29:16,218 --> 00:29:19,654
I'm so sorry. I know how hard
this must be for you.

351
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:21,947
Maybe Kara's right.

352
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:25,916
She warned me that all my friends
would betray me.

353
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:28,123
Maybe I don't belong here.

354
00:29:28,297 --> 00:29:31,130
-Maybe there's a better place for me.
-No. No.

355
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,758
I've done everything in my power
to defy Jor-El.

356
00:29:34,937 --> 00:29:36,871
Mom, it's only made things worse.

357
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,098
-Clark--
-Maybe I should go.

358
00:29:39,475 --> 00:29:40,772
Oh, sweetheart.

359
00:29:42,978 --> 00:29:45,538
You don't have to decide anything
right this minute.

360
00:29:45,714 --> 00:29:49,343
You know? It's been an incredibly
difficult time for you.

361
00:29:49,518 --> 00:29:53,318
With Pete gone, and Lana leaving....

362
00:29:54,423 --> 00:29:55,412
Lana....

363
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,645
Lex.

364
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:29,153
I just wanted to say bon voyage.

365
00:30:29,758 --> 00:30:31,350
Shouldn't you be at the courthouse?

366
00:30:31,894 --> 00:30:34,226
My father can wait.

367
00:30:34,396 --> 00:30:37,126
I couldn't let the last person
you saw from Smallville...

368
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:40,097
...be the shuttle driver looking for his tip.

369
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:43,898
Lex, I can't thank you enough
for everything that you've done for me.

370
00:30:44,072 --> 00:30:48,065
It's pretty clear your destiny lies far
beyond the Smallville city limits.

371
00:30:48,243 --> 00:30:50,143
I'm just trying to help you get there.

372
00:30:52,714 --> 00:30:55,615
I don't know what I did to deserve
such a great friend...

373
00:30:55,784 --> 00:30:58,651
...but I'm glad
that you came into my life.

374
00:30:59,821 --> 00:31:02,187
Maybe I'll bump into you
on the Champs Elysees.

375
00:31:04,426 --> 00:31:05,893
Are you gonna be in Paris?

376
00:31:06,828 --> 00:31:10,025
I haven't been in a couple years,
but now I have reason to go.

377
00:32:19,268 --> 00:32:20,565
Lex....

378
00:32:20,936 --> 00:32:25,168
Clark isn't here. The judge says if he's not
here in five minutes, he's setting bail.

379
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,366
-Did you try calling?
-At home and on his cell phone. No answer.

380
00:32:28,543 --> 00:32:31,478
Something big must've happened
because he flaked on Lana too.

381
00:32:31,713 --> 00:32:33,510
-Lex, what's going on?
-Nothing.

382
00:32:33,782 --> 00:32:36,615
I'm just hoping Clark
didn't change his mind.

383
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,750
You're his best friend.
Why would he do that?

384
00:32:44,393 --> 00:32:46,418
There he is, just in time to save the day.

385
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:49,396
Clark, hey....

386
00:33:00,442 --> 00:33:03,275
How do you feel about prison
now that you've been denied bail?

387
00:33:03,445 --> 00:33:07,472
You know, it's nothing new to be in prison
and to be an innocent man.

388
00:33:08,116 --> 00:33:11,313
In the end, I have no doubt
that justice will prevail.

389
00:33:11,486 --> 00:33:12,953
Are you planning an appeal, sir?

390
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:15,586
Clark....

391
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:20,523
-Thanks for showing up. It means a lot to me.
-I didn't come here for you, Lex.

392
00:33:20,696 --> 00:33:23,460
I came because it's the right thing to do.

393
00:33:24,866 --> 00:33:26,197
This friendship's over.

394
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:01,497
Everything you said has come true.

395
00:34:02,204 --> 00:34:05,901
I take no pleasure in your anguish, Kal-El.

396
00:34:07,376 --> 00:34:10,868
I know that you have great feelings
for these people...

397
00:34:11,446 --> 00:34:13,880
...and they will miss you when
you're gone.

398
00:34:15,117 --> 00:34:19,076
Ever since the meteor shower
I've brought them nothing but pain.

399
00:34:21,289 --> 00:34:24,053
Come with me, Kal-El...

400
00:34:24,326 --> 00:34:26,317
...and she will ease your suffering.

401
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:30,488
She?

402
00:34:32,234 --> 00:34:34,259
Your birth mother.

403
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:37,429
Lara?

404
00:34:38,306 --> 00:34:40,934
She's missed you so much.

405
00:34:43,779 --> 00:34:45,770
How could she?

406
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:48,144
She died.

407
00:34:50,085 --> 00:34:53,851
Her love lives on...

408
00:34:54,189 --> 00:34:57,625
...and will embrace you
all the days of your life.

409
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:13,702
I'm ready.

410
00:35:23,185 --> 00:35:24,982
-How long has Clark been gone?
-Since 3.

411
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:29,556
-Jonathan, the way he was talking....
-Call the Talon. I'm gonna check the caves.

412
00:35:34,095 --> 00:35:36,757
Mr. Kent, I found a match
for your phantom fingerprints.

413
00:35:36,932 --> 00:35:40,231
And even for me,
the keeper of the Wall of Weird...

414
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:41,892
...it's extremely weird.

415
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:07,989
Clark! Wait!

416
00:36:09,798 --> 00:36:14,098
Her name is not Kara. Her name is
Lindsay. And she's not from Krypton.

417
00:36:14,269 --> 00:36:15,566
What are you talking about?

418
00:36:15,737 --> 00:36:19,036
-lgnore him, Kal-El.
-Chloe matched her fingerprints...

419
00:36:19,207 --> 00:36:21,072
...to a young girl...

420
00:36:21,243 --> 00:36:25,771
...who was arrested
for shoplifting 1 6 years ago.

421
00:36:25,947 --> 00:36:28,313
Your name is Lindsay Harrison.

422
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,108
-My name is Kara.
-You were driving with your mother...

423
00:36:32,287 --> 00:36:34,187
...on the day of the meteor shower.

424
00:36:34,356 --> 00:36:36,790
Your car got a direct hit on Route 8.

425
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:38,516
That's right here near the caves.

426
00:36:39,895 --> 00:36:41,692
Clark, Lindsay's body was never found.

427
00:36:43,798 --> 00:36:47,290
-You haven't aged a day.
-Because I've been waiting for you...

428
00:36:47,836 --> 00:36:49,303
...in there.

429
00:36:49,471 --> 00:36:50,995
No, Lindsay.

430
00:36:51,172 --> 00:36:53,140
Jor-El used you.

431
00:36:53,308 --> 00:36:56,072
He stole away your life.
He stripped you of your humanity...

432
00:36:56,244 --> 00:36:59,873
...all so he could lure Clark to him.

433
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:02,649
You two have to come with me right now.

434
00:37:02,817 --> 00:37:04,876
Go with Kara, Kal-El.

435
00:37:07,222 --> 00:37:09,053
I'm not going anywhere!

436
00:37:10,825 --> 00:37:13,123
I'll never be who you want me to be!

437
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:22,000
-What did you do to her?
-She served her purpose...

438
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,001
...as has Jonathan Kent.

439
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,207
Dad!

440
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,647
-Leave my father alone!
-Come forward...

441
00:37:34,983 --> 00:37:36,541
...or he will die.

442
00:37:40,989 --> 00:37:43,219
Come to me, Kal-El.

443
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:45,583
Clark!

444
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:48,756
I've lived a full life, son.

445
00:37:49,164 --> 00:37:54,761
Jor-El can do whatever he wants
to do to me as long as you're free.

446
00:37:54,936 --> 00:37:56,767
I'll never be free.

447
00:37:57,472 --> 00:37:59,497
Clark! No!

448
00:38:32,874 --> 00:38:34,171
Do it.

449
00:41:56,911 --> 00:41:58,845
Thank you.

450
00:42:02,984 --> 00:42:05,976
Kal-El, my son.

451
00:42:08,356 --> 00:42:11,689
Now you shall be reborn.

452
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
