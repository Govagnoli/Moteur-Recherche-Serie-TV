1
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,754
There's the hut.

2
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,673
Let's hope word of the evac order
made it out this far.

3
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,637
Let's go.

4
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,517
Good God.

5
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,433
Son of a bitch.

6
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,640
All right, let's get blood samples.
Ten cc's each.

7
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,869
Right.

8
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,192
Hey, this is a quarantined
hot zone. Get out! Now!

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,274
Did you hear me?

10
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,556
You're exposing yourself
to a deadly virus.

11
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,957
Clark, you're amazing.

12
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,714
Okay, so you're not gonna
win any dance contests...

13
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,677
<i>...but</i> you're definitely not the worst.

14
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,912
Lana, I almost started a 10-person
pileup doing the two-step.

15
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,469
We should skip the dancing
before someone gets hurt.

16
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,029
Well, maybe we should try
something else more often.

17
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,474
Like what?

18
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,029
Well, I'll give you a hint.

19
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,352
Chloe happens to be pulling
an all nighter at the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

20
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,750
So you have the dorm room
all to yourself.

21
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,871
All to ourselves.

22
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,114
That sounds great, it really does.

23
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,477
But I have to get back to the farm.

24
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,473
It's gonna rain tomorrow
and I have to put up some tarps.

25
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,158
Clark, whenever you're ready,
I'll be waiting.

26
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,833
As long as it takes.

27
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,077
No pressure.

28
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,958
Lana.

29
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,634
I gotta go, it's getting late.
But I'll talk to you tomorrow.

30
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,916
- Okay.
- Okay.

31
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,474
I thought she'd never leave.

32
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,712
Hi, I'm Simone.

33
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,439
I was just leaving.

34
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,158
What's the hurry?

35
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,075
You're not going anywhere
until I tell you to.

36
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,149
Okay.

37
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,956
You're gonna believe
everything I tell you...

38
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,917
<i>...and</i> you're gonna do
everything I say.

39
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,877
Starting now.

40
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,792
What do you have in mind?

41
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,958
Smallville?

42
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,753
What the hell are you doing?

43
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,914
Lois, I'd like you to meet <i>Simone...</i>

44
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,592
...my new girlfriend.

45
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,559
I got your text message.

46
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,190
Lana, I apologize for interrupting
your Saturday night...

47
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,191
...but I thought
you'd be interested.

48
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,669
It's okay. I was just
on my way back to Metropolis.

49
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,159
What's going on?

50
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,590
My father taught me
never to reveal my hand...

51
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,194
...but I consider you my partner.

52
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,317
If it wasn't for you, I would have
never known the spacecraft existed.

53
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,635
- Have you found the ship?
- No.

54
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,836
But I have managed
to track down Milton Fine.

55
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,231
- What does he got to do with this?
- He was seen several times around...

56
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,119
...the warehouse where
I stored the spacecraft.

57
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,396
And he happened
to disappear from Smallville...

58
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,790
...the same exact day
the ship vanished.

59
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,155
Something tells me
it's not a coincidence.

60
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,636
So either you're planning
an exotic vacation...

61
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,394
...or this professor is somewhere
in Central America?

62
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,597
He was last seen in Honduras.
My jet leaves in an hour.

63
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,798
Lex, let me come with you,
maybe I can help.

64
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,349
Lana, I appreciate your passion...

65
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,988
...but I have no idea
what I'm walking into.

66
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,992
I can't risk putting you in danger.

67
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,429
I promise, when I get back,
I'll tell you everything.

68
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,558
Here you go.

69
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,513
Apple pie. Well, what else?

70
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,435
- My mom just made it.
- Of course she did.

71
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,075
That's delicious.

72
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,117
All I need now is
a glass of champagne.

73
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,431
But I don't suppose you have that
hidden behind the marmalade.

74
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,112
Clark?

75
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,597
Clark?

76
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,758
What did you...?

77
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,271
- Where did you get that?
- Hal's Liquor Store in Metropolis.

78
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,312
What?

79
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,198
Metropolis? How?

80
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,793
I can run really fast.

81
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,598
So if I were to say, <i>"clark...</i>

82
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,794
...I want some
chocolate-covered strawberries."

83
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,153
Here you go.

84
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,111
You are too good to be true.

85
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,594
Yeah.

86
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,509
I think it's time you told
your girlfriend about us.

87
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,190
Call her and ask her to come over.

88
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,151
Okay, I am the first person
to concede...

89
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,515
...that anything is possible
in this universe...

90
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,194
...but Clark Kent lip-Iocked
with another girl?

91
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,318
Chloe, I'm telling you,
it was the last tango at the Talon.

92
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,675
Unfortunately, I had front row seats.

93
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,437
Well, something must have
happened to him...

94
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,556
...because he wouldn't just do this.

95
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,518
I know you have this whole
hero-worship thing with the guy...

96
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,116
...but face it, Clark is no different
than any other red-blooded male.

97
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,430
His brain, it's not his
commanding officer.

98
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,955
No, you don't know him
like I do. He is different.

99
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,475
- He wouldn't do this to Lana.
- He already has.

100
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,030
- Lf Lana's our friend, we need to warn...
- No, hold your fire.

101
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,510
Now, before you utter one word
to Lana about this, I just wan...

102
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,954
One word about what?

103
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,555
What's going on?

104
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,237
Lois needs a place to stay.
She needs to stay at our dorm room...

105
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,233
...for a couple of nights.
- Right, the heater's on the fritz.

106
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,789
I just wanted to make sure
I brought it up to you...

107
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,552
...before she said anything.

108
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,915
Okay.

109
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,833
Lois, you are always welcome here.

110
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,072
- Great.
- Great.

111
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,391
I thought you were
pulling an all nighter.

112
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,478
Well, as much as I enjoy
a good dose of sleep deprivation...

113
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,312
...my deadline was pushed.

114
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,152
Nice.

115
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,433
Hello. Hi.

116
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,799
Oh, is everything all right?

117
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,435
Yeah, I'll be there as soon as I can.

118
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,431
- Who was that?
- That was Clark.

119
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,239
He said he needs to talk to me.
Seems really urgent.

120
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,836
I'll see you guys later.

121
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,320
So, lightning legs...

122
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,634
...got any other special skills?

123
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,394
- Well, l...
- I wanna know...

124
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,755
...everything you're capable of.

125
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,033
An S for Simone.

126
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,911
Ever since I was little, I dreamed
about my knight in shining armor.

127
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,629
And now that dream
has actually come true.

128
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,516
Take off your shirt.

129
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,789
Your turn.

130
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,950
Now, take off
the rest of your clothes.

131
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,072
Simone...

132
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,596
...with my powers...

133
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,194
...I could hurt you.

134
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,354
That's a chance I'm willing to take.

135
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,438
Make love to me, Clark.

136
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,199
Oh, God.

137
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,875
Oh, God.

138
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,831
You don't care
about her anymore, Clark.

139
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,911
Go tell her that it's over.

140
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,630
Lana, wait.

141
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,548
This is why you couldn't
spend the night with me?

142
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,390
Lana, I've fallen in love
with someone else.

143
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,438
Mr. Luthor?

144
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,469
<i>Welcome, Simone.</i>

145
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,876
<i>Don 't you look</i>
<i>delectable this evening.</i>

146
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,077
Do I ever get to meet the billionaire
boy wonder face to face?

147
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,397
Well, as much as I'd like
to admire you up close and personal...

148
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,869
...I prefer to hold on to my free will.

149
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,272
<i>How is your progress?</i>

150
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,715
<i>Let's just say Lana Lang</i>
<i>won 't be sending Clark...</i>

151
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,472
<i>... any more Valentine's Day cards.</i>

152
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,756
And what about Clark?

153
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,275
Have you discovered anything
unusual about him?

154
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,113
Absolutely.

155
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,878
What is it?

156
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,599
<i>Clark Kent is the most extraordinary...</i>

157
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,834
<i>... kisser.</i>

158
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,118
There must be more.

159
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,669
<i>If he had some secret,</i>
<i>don 't you think I would know?</i>

160
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,435
With Clark Kent, what you see
is what you get. A corn-fed farm boy.

161
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,511
<i>I've done everything</i>
<i>you've asked me to.</i>

162
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,478
Now you can get the hell out
of my life and leave me alone.

163
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,395
Patience, Simone.

164
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,028
There's someone else
I'd like you to <i>meet...</i>

165
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,919
...in Honduras.
- No way. This was a one-time deal.

166
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,469
- Remember?
- Do you remember that I just...

167
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,155
...unearthed evidence that could put you
in prison for the rest of your life?

168
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,914
Now, I think the least you could do
is one more little favor for me.

169
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,759
I'll be back tomorrow night.

170
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,831
We'll talk then.

171
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,512
Sir, I have Roberts on the secure line.

172
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,274
Turns out Milton Fine
isn't who we think he is.

173
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,309
Oh, thank God you're fully clothed.

174
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,517
I was afraid I'd be walking in
on some sort of dangerous liaison.

175
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,999
I take it you talked to Lana.

176
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,469
I could barely hear her
through the sobs, but yeah.

177
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,950
She called to tell me that she was
spending the night at Aunt Nell's.

178
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,030
So where's the hottie?

179
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,310
If you're talking about Simone,
she's in the house.

180
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,278
I don't get it.

181
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,079
I mean, if it was Red K,
you wouldn't be doing chores.

182
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,879
If it was Silver K, you'd be afraid that
that pitchfork...

183
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,031
...was gonna turn you
into a shish kebab.

184
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,034
What happened to you, Clark?

185
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,477
I fell in love.

186
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,912
I don't think you fell.

187
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,559
I think you were pushed...

188
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,994
...off a cliff.

189
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,033
Chloe, just because you know my secret,
doesn't mean you know how I feel.

190
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,556
Yeah, but I do know that you'd never
intentionally hurt Lana like this.

191
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,758
You said my relationship with Lana
would never go anywhere...

192
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,957
...as long as I have to lie about
who I am. And you were right.

193
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,918
So how are things gonna be
any different with Simone?

194
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,192
I told Simone about my powers.

195
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,790
Wait a minute, Clark. You may think
you're madly in love with this <i>girl...</i>

196
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,520
...but you need to stay away.
- You don't even know her.

197
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,229
No, but I know you well enough
to know when you're being manipulated.

198
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,589
You're crossing a line here.
I've always trusted you.

199
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,594
So how about this time,
you trust me? Let me live my life.

200
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,238
Back off.

201
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,435
- Clark, is that you?
- Hi, you must be Simone.

202
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,435
I'm... I'm chloe. I'm clark's friend.
It's really great to finally meet you.

203
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,432
Hello.

204
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,231
I'm so glad that clark
hooked up with you.

205
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,311
I mean, he was just
miserable with Lana...

206
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,756
...and now, I honestly have never
seen him more happy.

207
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,480
You two are really
perfect for each other.

208
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,558
That's nice to hear.

209
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,996
- Do you know where he is?
- Yeah, he's in the barn.

210
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,158
Clark, I need you.

211
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,639
Clark?

212
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,713
I would have had tea and petits fours
waiting, but I didn't expect you so soon.

213
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,159
You knew I was coming.

214
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,515
You leave a trail of breadcrumbs,
no surprise when the crow comes calling.

215
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,910
I think a simple phone call
would have sufficed.

216
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,359
I couldn't reveal the truth
about myself until I was sure...

217
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,275
...you were dedicated to your cause.
- Well, I hate to disappoint you...

218
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,675
...but I already know what you are.

219
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,309
And it's not
a professor of history, is it?

220
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,990
No, it's something
much more exciting.

221
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,233
Tell me, what's the benefits package
of a government operative...

222
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,198
...working for a covert branch
of the State Department?

223
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,831
Very good.

224
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,559
You found that breadcrumb
on your own.

225
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,592
I want to know
what you were doing...

226
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,275
...posing as a college professor
in a Kansas farm town.

227
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,440
I was investigating the possibility
of an extraterrestrial presence.

228
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,712
This investigation...

229
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,791
...did it bear any fruit?

230
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,350
Well, we believe a spacecraft
of unknown origin...

231
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,432
...touched down during
the recent meteor shower.

232
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,038
But an individual
with quick reflexes and vast resources...

233
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,158
...was able to get to it
before we could.

234
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,830
So that's why you were
investigating LuthorCorp.

235
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,479
Yeah.

236
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,594
And I admire the remarkable advances
you've made in the name of science.

237
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,797
Too bad you couldn't get into
that ship when you had a chance.

238
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,633
You know where it is.

239
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,356
The ancient Mayans believed they were
visited by great beings from the heavens.

240
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,431
You think the ship's in Honduras.

241
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,354
Well, I'm certainly
not here for the coffee.

242
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,037
So I think clark's bizarre behavior might
be some form of supercharged hypnosis.

243
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,510
I've heard of hypnotism being used
to stop smoking or lose weight...

244
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,274
...but to reduce Clark to some
goo-goo-eyed love slave?

245
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,113
This isn't over-the-counter hypnosis,
it's prescription strength.

246
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,840
And it never wears off.
Check this out.

247
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,555
Simone's dad was world-renowned
for curing his patients of all inflictions...

248
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,756
...everything from cravings to cancer.

249
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,156
Maybe I can talk to him
about my nail-biting.

250
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,635
I'm afraid it's a little late for that.

251
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,516
Last month he died
during a botched burglary.

252
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,918
Wait a second, I've seen that jewel.

253
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,429
So have I, around Simone's
scrawny little neck.

254
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,875
It's an ancient family heirloom
that dates back...

255
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,951
...to the alchemists
in medieval England.

256
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,429
It was also the only thing stolen.

257
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,592
Are you saying Simone's responsible
for her own father's death?

258
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,675
I don't know. If it meant getting
daddy's hyper-hypno powers, maybe.

259
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,799
I just think it's a tad bit cocky to be
wearing it around your neck like a medal.

260
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,799
Not if you can make any cop
believe that you're innocent.

261
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,793
What I don't understand is,
of all people, why go after Clark?

262
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,393
I don't know.

263
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,278
We need to snap him
out of it soon...

264
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,512
...before he does something
he can't ever come back from.

265
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,433
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's move.

266
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,428
Yeah, you know, l...
I just need to grab something.

267
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,068
- I'll meet you there.
- Okay.

268
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,999
His father carved it.

269
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,955
After claiming to have seen
a <i>carroza de los dioses</i> land from the sky.

270
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,158
- Chariot of the gods.
- Yeah.

271
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,191
I wanna talk to him.

272
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,113
I know you can do many things...

273
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,794
<i>...but</i> I'm not sure
you can communicate with the dead.

274
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,396
Days after the sighting, his wife
came home to find his charred remains.

275
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,795
Despite urban myths...

276
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,554
...human beings
don't spontaneously combust.

277
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,755
No.

278
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,556
We believe whoever or whatever was
in that spaceship incinerated the man.

279
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,669
In fact, we suspect this alien race
poses a grave threat to the entire planet.

280
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,718
Well, how do you defend against
a threat of that magnitude?

281
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,959
It presents a great challenge.

282
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,192
We are working on
a potential weapon...

283
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,109
...a weapon that would greatly benefit
from Luthorcorp's assistance.

284
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,876
We're well aware of your tireless quest
for extraterrestrial life.

285
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,359
Your tenacity is impressive.

286
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,159
I'll help in any way I <i>can...</i>

287
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,675
...but I want unrestricted access
to all your data.

288
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,389
- That's a bold request.
- Well, without it, this discussion is over.

289
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,471
I'm not sure
you understand me, Mr. Luthor.

290
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,359
If we don't work together,
there may not be a LuthorCorp...

291
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,556
...or a government left.

292
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,638
Think about that on your flight home.

293
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,719
Where you off to, Romeo?

294
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,316
- A motel with vibrating beds?
- Simone and I are going to California.

295
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,516
That way I can get away
from your commentary.

296
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,513
My running commentary says
you're hypnotized.

297
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,274
You need to drop your suitcase
because you're not going.

298
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,710
I'm asking you nicely, step aside.

299
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,791
Look, I didn't wanna have to do <i>this...</i>

300
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,430
...but if necessary,
I'm gonna have to take you down.

301
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,315
I see we have a visitor.

302
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,590
I suggest you turn your boy toy
back to normal...

303
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,752
...before I reach over and rip out
those pearly white teeth.

304
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,114
- Clark, be a love and knock her out.
- Yeah, right.

305
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,029
Oh, my God. What happened?

306
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:29,351
Mrs. Kent, I want you to do whatever
it takes to stop her from following us.

307
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,788
Where are you off to?

308
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,991
We're leaving Smallville forever.

309
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,197
And you couldn't be more thrilled.
You won't miss clark one bit.

310
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,879
Well then, you two
have a wonderful time.

311
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,877
Thanks, Mom.

312
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,918
- We better go.
- Okay. Bye.

313
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,430
Oh, and we have to make one quick
pit stop at the Luthor mansion.

314
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,273
- I need you to do me a favor.
- Whatever you need.

315
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,278
Clark, you're gonna kill Lex Luthor.

316
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,071
He's a dead man.

317
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,195
Mrs. Kent, what are you doing?

318
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,280
Stay right where you are.

319
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,074
Look, you're not <i>yourself...</i>

320
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,392
<i>...so</i> why don't you quit
the Calamity Jane impersonation...

321
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,755
...and drop the weapon.

322
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,190
I don't like it
any more than you do, Lois...

323
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,271
<i>...but</i> it's the only way
to keep you here.

324
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,951
Oh, my God,
I just knocked out Martha Kent.

325
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,476
Hello? The woman was about
to wallpaper her living room...

326
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,996
...with my brain matter.
- Right. Where's clark?

327
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,510
Well, while I was seeing stars,
I think his girlfriend...

328
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,837
...said she wanted to go
to the Luthor mansion or something.

329
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,231
So why don't you stay here
and keep Mrs. Kent...

330
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,519
Mrs. Kent?

331
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,236
Well, it's always nice to be
welcomed home after a trip...

332
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,231
<i>...but</i> I didn't expect to find you here.

333
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,112
Clark, you've been hypnotized.

334
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,355
How else could you throw me
across a room?

335
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,472
- I'm done with you, Lex.
- You're under Simone's control now.

336
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,275
The girl's a cold-blooded
murderer, Clark.

337
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,158
Your lies can't help you now.

338
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,510
Clark, before she wore that jewel,
she was nothing but a petty shoplifter.

339
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,513
Her dad never trusted her with the gem,
so she murdered him.

340
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,154
I have the whole thing
on surveillance tape.

341
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,790
You don't believe
a word he said, Clark.

342
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,718
My security's on the way.

343
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,751
Oh, I've met your security team.

344
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,798
I hope you don't mind,
I gave them all the day off.

345
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,954
Finish him off, Clark...

346
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,279
...and make him suffer.

347
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,796
- I'm sorry, clark.
- No. Chloe, no.

348
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,110
Lex! Kill her...

349
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,639
...and then kill yourself.

350
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,071
Are you all right, Clark?

351
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,271
I think so.

352
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,797
I feel like I woke up
from a bad dream...

353
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,678
...except I remember all the details.

354
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,799
Yeah. Did you and Simone
ever actually...?

355
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,713
- No. Thank God.
- Okay.

356
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,270
The moral of the story is never gaze
into the eyes of a seductive woman...

357
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,237
...wearing a gemstone
around her neck...

358
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,834
...unless, of course,
her name is Lana Lang.

359
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,998
Have you talked to her yet?
You guys kiss and make up?

360
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,750
- You haven't talked to her, have you?
- No.

361
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,192
What are you waiting for?

362
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,271
I mean, she knows
that you were hypnotized.

363
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,351
Every single one of us
has gone through...

364
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,715
...some sort of an identity crisis
at one point.

365
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,950
It's like a rite of passage in Smallville.

366
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,031
She'll understand.

367
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,873
Maybe I don't want her to understand.

368
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,956
See, as horrible as all this was...

369
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,430
...it did accomplish one thing
that I didn't have the guts to do myself.

370
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,672
It broke me and Lana up.

371
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,592
What? Wait a minute.
Are you still hypno'd?

372
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,957
Chloe, how many times can I break
someone's heart before it crumbles?

373
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,553
Yeah, but it wasn't your fault.

374
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,109
- You were hypnotized.
- Lana wasn't.

375
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,231
Chloe, her feelings were real.

376
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,109
The look of pain in her eye
when she walked in on Simone and I...

377
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,358
...it made me realize that
my power to hurt Lana...

378
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,353
...is stronger than all my powers
put together.

379
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,996
Meeting a girl with hocus-pocus jewelry
isn't an everyday occurrence.

380
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,997
Yeah, but hurting Lana
has become one.

381
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,675
And as long as I have to lie to her about
who I am, I'm gonna cause her pain.

382
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,116
And as long as you don't set the record
straight, she's gonna hate you.

383
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,828
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

384
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,874
Maybe it'll help her move on,
forget I ever existed...

385
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,072
...and find someone who can
give her what she deserves.

386
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,275
You just need to know
that if you do this...

387
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,273
...that's it, game over,
there's no more quarters left.

388
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,396
I mean, you're saying
goodbye forever.

389
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,716
It will crush her, Clark.

390
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:35,710
Please just think long and hard
before you end this for good.

391
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,630
I've climbed these stairs
so many times before...

392
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,677
...why do they seem steeper
than ever?

393
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,515
Thanks for coming,
I didn't wanna bother you at school.

394
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,797
Clark, you can spare me the speech
about how sorry you are.

395
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,279
I know you were hypnotized...

396
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,113
<i>...and</i> I know that you weren't in control
of your actions.

397
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,992
I need to be honest with you.

398
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,836
That would be refreshing.

399
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,553
I don't know any other way to say <i>it...</i>

400
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,035
...but the truth is...

401
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,995
...my feelings for you have changed.

402
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,435
Clark, I want you
to look me in the eye...

403
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,990
<i>...and</i> tell me that you don't love me.

404
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,038
I don't love you.

405
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,036
I have waited for you to grow up...

406
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,873
...to get over whatever
hang-ups you may have.

407
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,234
I never meant to hurt you.

408
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,159
I don't want another
Clark Kent apology.

409
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,272
It's over.

410
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,552
Forever.

411
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,672
We need more samples.

412
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,950
How did she take it?

413
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,069
I've never seen her so <i>hurt...</i>

414
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,276
...so angry.

415
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,713
Saying those words was
the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

416
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,354
You're an adult now, <i>clark...</i>

417
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,716
...in an adult relationship...

418
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,633
...and they rarely end
the way we want them to.

419
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,638
You know, I just didn't know
what else to do.

420
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,948
It was either make a clean break...

421
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,113
...or tell her my secret.
- Yeah.

422
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,112
I know you didn't tell Lana the truth
because you wanted to protect her...

423
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,273
...but maybe there was
actually more to it.

424
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,432
What do you mean?

425
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,872
Do you think you didn't tell her
because maybe deep down...

426
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,273
<i>...you</i> didn't think she was the one?

427
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,795
- Mom, I'll always love Lana.
- I know.

428
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,270
That's why you did this.

429
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,596
But you didn't just
break her heart, Clark...

430
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,796
...you gave her reason to hate you.

431
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,470
I just hope her anger doesn't drive her
to do something we'll all regret.

432
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,315
Oh, just the woman I wanted to see.

433
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,438
So it turns out everybody's
favorite academic, Milton Fine...

434
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,874
...isn't a professor at all.

435
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,713
Lex, I'm not here
to talk about Milton Fine.

436
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,678
I actually wanted you
to be the first to know.

437
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,071
Is everything okay?

438
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,750
Clark and I broke up.

439
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,232
For real.

440
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,517
- Lana, I'm... I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay. Don't be.

441
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,478
I actually do feel like
a hundred tons of secrets and lies...

442
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,358
...have been lifted off my shoulders.

443
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,829
You know what it's like
being friends with Clark.

444
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,635
No matter what he tells you,
you don't know if it's the truth.

445
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,998
You can never trust him.

446
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,798
Lana...

447
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,629
<i>...I</i> know clark's probably not the easiest
guy to be in a relationship with.

448
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,278
I don't think he... He means...

449
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,874
Please don't defend him, Lex.

450
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,792
How could I have been so stupid?

451
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,432
You're not stupid.

452
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,311
You just put your trust
in the wrong person.

453
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,271
