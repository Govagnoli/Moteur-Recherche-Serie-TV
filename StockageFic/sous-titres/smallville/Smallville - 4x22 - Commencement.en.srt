1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
"Previously on Smallville"

2
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:05,383
"I knew you would
return my son"

3
00:00:06,476 --> 00:00:08,576
I felt as if something
was calling me home.

4
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:10,179
Everything we've been
trough with Jor-El...

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,579
I just wanted to close
that chapter in my life.

6
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:14,243
There is a darkness in me
that I can't always control.

7
00:00:14,245 --> 00:00:16,345
Well, you've certainly
seen me at my worst.

8
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:18,006
And at your best.

9
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:19,602
Three relics...

10
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:21,188
hidden around
the world...

11
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,744
by scientifically advanced
ancient cultures...

12
00:00:23,744 --> 00:00:25,300
Water and this
one means fire...

13
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,300
and the one up
there that air.

14
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:28,447
Put them together...

15
00:00:28,823 --> 00:00:29,955
Where is it?

16
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,087
God help me.

17
00:00:38,349 --> 00:00:39,849
By now you'd
know that Lana...

18
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,349
is nothing more than
my mothers pawn.

19
00:00:41,471 --> 00:00:42,771
Martha, Clark still
feels responsible...

20
00:00:42,772 --> 00:00:44,071
for my heart problems.

21
00:00:44,106 --> 00:00:45,518
If you'd found
out something...

22
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:48,147
Something someone
didn't want you...

23
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:48,991
to know about them...

24
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:49,991
Would you tell them?

25
00:00:50,673 --> 00:00:51,830
What did I do?

26
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:52,865
You trusted me.

27
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:54,716
I can't let you
walk out, not again...

28
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,133
That's why this
time it'll be different.

29
00:00:57,186 --> 00:00:57,886
This time?

30
00:00:58,202 --> 00:00:59,802
You are an amazing
young man, Clark,

31
00:01:00,064 --> 00:01:01,964
you make life and death
decisions every day.

32
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:03,476
Trust your gut!

33
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:06,211
Greed will drive others
to hunt the Stones...

34
00:01:06,344 --> 00:01:07,868
and will drive the
world to famine...

35
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:10,949
war and the earth's
ultimate destruction.

36
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:13,209
Where is the stone?

37
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:14,729
I gave it to Lana.

38
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,234
She is the chosen one
and we all know that.

39
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,744
Clark's more connected
to this than any of us.

40
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:23,065
It's Clark, he's...

41
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:24,912
A man can't deny
his true nature.

42
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,399
It's time to fulfill
my destiny.

43
00:01:27,943 --> 00:01:29,443
I am the villain
of the story.

44
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:33,655
And now Season
Finale of Smallville.

45
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:48,332
I have to applaud
you, Lana.

46
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:51,928
I raised my son...

47
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:53,500
to have a willpower...

48
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:55,724
that couldn't be
broken by anything.

49
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:00,249
Except his love
for you, apparently.

50
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:07,003
What do you
want from me?

51
00:02:07,038 --> 00:02:08,272
The stone.

52
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,595
That one
Lionel gave you.

53
00:02:11,077 --> 00:02:12,577
Lionel?

54
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,500
He never gave me the...

55
00:02:14,609 --> 00:02:16,309
I'm gonna find it whether
you help or not.

56
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:42,600
Clark!

57
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:44,156
It's okay, it's just
a bad dream.

58
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:45,891
You scared the daylights
out of us yelling like that.

59
00:05:46,297 --> 00:05:47,197
What?

60
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,695
You kept yelling
"It's coming!" over and over.

61
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:18,247
4x22 Commencement

62
00:07:10,587 --> 00:07:13,058
She was coming at me,
it happened so quickly.

63
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,052
I don't even
remember stabbing her.

64
00:07:15,345 --> 00:07:19,388
Lana, I want you to take a
deep breath and try to relax.

65
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,663
Lex, a woman is
dead because of me.

66
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:24,661
I killed her.
No, no!

67
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:26,303
You had no choice.

68
00:07:28,617 --> 00:07:31,317
You did what anyone would
do if their life was at stake.

69
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:33,490
I have to tell Jason.

70
00:07:34,534 --> 00:07:35,777
She was his mother.

71
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:37,089
I'll deal with Jason.

72
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,824
Lex, there's a body
in my apartment.

73
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,860
I have to go the police.

74
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:40,966
I have to tell them
what happened.

75
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:43,160
Lana, I'm not sure
that's such a wise idea.

76
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:47,582
Genevieve Teague
was a powerful woman,

77
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:49,566
married to an extremely
powerful lawyer.

78
00:07:49,741 --> 00:07:51,694
Even though it's
clearly self defense...

79
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:53,209
Edward Teague is
gonna make sure...

80
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:54,911
the jury sees otherwise.

81
00:07:54,911 --> 00:07:56,230
What's gonna
happen to me?

82
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:58,746
I'm gonna go to prison.

83
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:00,850
No.

84
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:04,563
I'll hire one of the best
defense attorneys...

85
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:06,043
in the country.

86
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:07,391
And once he arrives
from New York,

87
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,431
we'll go to
the authorities.

88
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:10,599
Ok.

89
00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:11,736
Thank you.

90
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:20,174
You have to trust me.

91
00:08:20,777 --> 00:08:22,079
Until the lawyer arrives,

92
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,079
I want you to stay here
and talk to no one.

93
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:33,243
My purse.

94
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:34,844
Where's my purse?

95
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,083
Don't worry.

96
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:38,326
It's still there.

97
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:39,761
I'd never take it from you.

98
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,088
Mr. Luthor.

99
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:45,092
We have a situation.

100
00:08:48,364 --> 00:08:49,664
It's gonna be okay.

101
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:14,016
I can't help but feel this
is some kind of warning.

102
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:16,251
Clark, it was nothing
but a bad dream.

103
00:09:16,615 --> 00:09:18,017
You used to have
nightmares all the time...

104
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:18,999
when you were
little, remember?

105
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:20,199
This time is different.

106
00:09:20,714 --> 00:09:22,614
It felt so real.

107
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,696
And if it is a warning
I need to do something.

108
00:09:24,717 --> 00:09:25,859
Yeah, what
you need to do...

109
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:26,579
is you need to get
some shuteye..

110
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:28,719
so that you're not
half asleep tomorrow...

111
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:29,467
when they hand
you that diploma.

112
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:30,431
Your dad's right,

113
00:09:30,431 --> 00:09:33,137
Don't let a nightmare spoil
your high school graduation.

114
00:09:33,228 --> 00:09:34,361
Nightmare?

115
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:36,313
So that's what all this
commotion is about?

116
00:09:37,137 --> 00:09:38,037
Lois.

117
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,810
You know, if it makes
you feel any better...

118
00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:41,407
I have'em all the time.

119
00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:45,019
I had this one last week...

120
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,830
really scary!

121
00:09:47,227 --> 00:09:48,527
This, uh,...

122
00:09:49,738 --> 00:09:51,238
guy wearing a red cape.

123
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:53,497
Oh, that sounds
horrible, Lois.

124
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:55,762
Yeah!

125
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:58,392
There's something I wanted
to tell all you guys,

126
00:09:58,402 --> 00:09:59,658
I just didn't know
when to,

127
00:09:59,693 --> 00:10:01,193
so I guess 2 A.M.
in the morning...

128
00:10:01,257 --> 00:10:03,257
is good as time as any.
What is it, Lois?

129
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,811
Oh, The general
recruited me...

130
00:10:05,811 --> 00:10:07,884
on a recon mission
to track down my sister,

131
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:09,184
the grifter, in Europe.

132
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:11,217
So, we are headed
for Heidelberg tomorrow.

133
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:13,648
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

134
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:17,866
Clark, I know how
devastated you must be...

135
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,017
but if you could just...

136
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:21,881
keep your tears to a
minimum, I'd appreciate it.

137
00:10:22,184 --> 00:10:23,184
I'll try.

138
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:26,101
Thanks.

139
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:29,994
Mr. and Mrs. Kent,

140
00:10:29,994 --> 00:10:32,543
I just wanted to say
thanks for everything.

141
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:33,508
You guys are...

142
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,508
like the mom and dad I've
always wanted to have.

143
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,584
Lois, we want you
to know that...

144
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:40,549
you are welcome
back here any time.

145
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:42,837
Actually...
We'll all miss you, Lois.

146
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:47,657
I'll miss you all, too.

147
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:49,915
Him...

148
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,370
not so much.

149
00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:14,715
I'd thought I do
Miss Lang a favor and...

150
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,491
tidy up the place a bit.

151
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:22,785
She left a quite
a mess, quite a mess.

152
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,350
What are you
looking for, dad?

153
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:29,132
The good housekeeping
seal of approval?

154
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:31,664
You know, for a
woman without a heart...

155
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:35,249
Genevieve Teague certainly
did have a lot of blood.

156
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:38,212
You didn't come here
to do a postmortem...

157
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:39,120
on Genevieve Teague.

158
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,620
What is it you want?

159
00:11:41,906 --> 00:11:43,406
I'd like to offer a trade.

160
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:50,721
Lana Lang's freedom...

161
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,668
in exchange for the, hmm,

162
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:54,763
artifact she has
in her possession.

163
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:57,180
Dad, don't you
think your search...

164
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,700
for these three
ancient stones...

165
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:01,400
is starting to border
on the fanatical?

166
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:02,948
Let me remind you, Lex,

167
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:07,156
it was you who looted
the ruins of Egypt...

168
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,910
to get your hands on
one of those stones.

169
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,297
Trust me, Lana Lang has
nothing to do with this.

170
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,361
Oh, so
chivalrous of you.

171
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:17,981
You are the gallant
hero trying...

172
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:20,981
to protect the
damsel in distress.

173
00:12:23,598 --> 00:12:24,898
I'm warning you.

174
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:26,686
Leave her alone!

175
00:12:27,592 --> 00:12:29,133
But all your life
you've had a, uh,

176
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:31,648
a tendency
to let the damsel...

177
00:12:31,648 --> 00:12:35,048
lead you straight into
the mouth of the dragon.

178
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:38,177
Your feelings for Miss Lang,

179
00:12:38,177 --> 00:12:41,154
don't let them cripple
your common sense, son.

180
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:47,151
I expect to see that
stone by noon tomorrow.

181
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:50,533
It would be a shame if,
um, Genevieve's corpse...

182
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:51,853
were delivered
to the sheriff...

183
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:54,853
with Lana Lang's
DNA as postage.

184
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:23,678
Sir,

185
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,075
you better take a look
at the right ascension.

186
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:30,872
How long has
there been activity?

187
00:13:30,872 --> 00:13:32,783
There was not anything
there 10 seconds ago.

188
00:13:32,783 --> 00:13:34,420
It just came out
of nowhere.

189
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,053
My God,

190
00:13:43,284 --> 00:13:44,984
it's headed
straight for Earth!

191
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:06,352
I realize hand-eye
coordination...

192
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:07,753
isn't one of your
best qualities.

193
00:14:07,753 --> 00:14:08,566
Here,

194
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:10,626
let me help
you with that.

195
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:12,789
Lois, I'm not sure what
I'm gonna do without you.

196
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:14,924
Ah, come on, Clark,

197
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,959
your future is laid out
right in front of you.

198
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:18,505
You're gonna go
to community college,

199
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:22,127
major in agriculture, probably
minor in law enforcement.

200
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:23,475
And then you
and Lana gonna have...

201
00:14:23,475 --> 00:14:24,920
a nice little
church wedding.

202
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Excuse me?

203
00:14:26,018 --> 00:14:28,018
It's written in the
stars and you know it.

204
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:28,971
It's only a
matter of time...

205
00:14:28,971 --> 00:14:29,978
before you join
the bowling league...

206
00:14:29,978 --> 00:14:31,877
and take over the family
farm, and then, well,

207
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,620
you and Lana can bring little
Clark Jr. into the world.

208
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,555
I think you're
hallucinating.

209
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:40,673
No. Hallucinating
would be imagining...

210
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:42,388
Clark Kent going
off to the...

211
00:14:42,388 --> 00:14:44,388
big city to make his
mark in the world.

212
00:14:44,423 --> 00:14:46,075
I'm just being realistic.

213
00:14:48,503 --> 00:14:49,403
Lois,

214
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:50,938
what are your big
plans after Europe,

215
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:51,808
you're gonna go
back to school?

216
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,661
Maybe actually stay
a little while?

217
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,350
I have a feeling that if I'm
gonna get an education,

218
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:57,949
it's gonna be
in the real world.

219
00:14:58,436 --> 00:15:00,712
And I took this career
test in some magazine.

220
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:02,609
It said that my perfect
job would be, uh,

221
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:04,147
radio disc jockey.

222
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:05,655
That makes sense,
you talk enough,

223
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,655
there won't be
any dead air.

224
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:10,706
You mock me now Smallville,
but you just wait and see.

225
00:15:10,706 --> 00:15:11,799
Journalism,

226
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,659
do you ever thought
about that?

227
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:14,632
You wrote some
half decent articles...

228
00:15:14,632 --> 00:15:15,615
in your short lived
career at the Torch.

229
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:16,679
Naw, kill me first.

230
00:15:16,714 --> 00:15:17,814
Even if I could spell,

231
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,939
the last thing
I'd wanna do...

232
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:20,182
is spent my time
in a newsroom.

233
00:15:20,182 --> 00:15:22,474
With my luck I'd probably
end up across the desk...

234
00:15:22,474 --> 00:15:25,474
from the most bumbling
reporter on the masthead.

235
00:15:29,516 --> 00:15:30,898
You know what?

236
00:15:31,076 --> 00:15:32,701
You actually look
handsome for a change.

237
00:15:33,284 --> 00:15:35,299
I'll take that
as a compliment.

238
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:38,609
Look, I know we've had our
disagreements in the past.

239
00:15:38,995 --> 00:15:40,668
And I will be the
first to admit...

240
00:15:40,668 --> 00:15:41,889
that I've made
own little hobby...

241
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:42,962
to bust your chops.

242
00:15:42,997 --> 00:15:44,536
Gotten used to it.

243
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:46,971
Besides, I know I haven't
been the most gracious host.

244
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:50,707
Look, I just want
you to know, Clark,

245
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,253
that when I'm sitting in
the audience today...

246
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:52,953
at your graduation...

247
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,216
and you stand up
on that stage...

248
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:57,245
in front of all
those people...

249
00:15:57,245 --> 00:15:59,445
I wanna be looking up at
you and thinking one thing.

250
00:16:00,574 --> 00:16:01,474
What's that?

251
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:04,667
Please, god,
don't let him trip!

252
00:16:05,513 --> 00:16:06,224
See you.

253
00:16:13,163 --> 00:16:14,495
Garon Cooper.

254
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:19,042
Caroline Creese.

255
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:23,403
Cody Davis.

256
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:27,337
Erica Feldman.

257
00:16:30,964 --> 00:16:32,164
Lauren Feldman.

258
00:16:33,134 --> 00:16:34,234
Did you see Lana yet?

259
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:35,448
Still no sign.

260
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:36,983
I'm starting to get worried.

261
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:38,544
Lana's never so much
as had a tardy day.

262
00:16:38,694 --> 00:16:40,694
She's not gonna miss her
high school graduation.

263
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,592
She'll be here.

264
00:16:46,995 --> 00:16:48,095
Michael Hall.

265
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:55,183
Holy Harold.

266
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:57,517
Tanya Hart.

267
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:02,897
Kate Horton.

268
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,790
Michael Hoover.

269
00:17:08,432 --> 00:17:09,432
Hannah Jacobs.

270
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,419
Michelle Jewel.

271
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,420
Oh, there's Clark.

272
00:17:14,504 --> 00:17:15,504
Clark Kent.

273
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
Lana Lang.

274
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:31,845
Have you seen her?

275
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:33,909
Lana Lang.

276
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:48,563
Attention!

277
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,010
Stay calm!

278
00:17:50,525 --> 00:17:52,525
By order of the Federal
Emergency Dekret:

279
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,076
All non-essential personnel
should evacuate...

280
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,774
the area within a
50 miles radius.

281
00:17:57,774 --> 00:17:59,374
In approximately 3 hours,

282
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,846
a meteor shower is
predicted in Smallville.

283
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:07,087
Oh, My God.

284
00:18:07,764 --> 00:18:09,164
Not again.

285
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,380
Please stay calm.

286
00:18:13,478 --> 00:18:15,007
There's no
need to panic.

287
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:18,298
Please seal your home and
carry only necessary items.

288
00:18:18,478 --> 00:18:19,317
Hey, Clark.

289
00:18:19,352 --> 00:18:20,652
can you believe it?

290
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:21,984
Twice in 16 years,

291
00:18:21,996 --> 00:18:23,059
I mean, this is just crazy!

292
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:24,392
Smallville's gotta
have some sort...

293
00:18:24,392 --> 00:18:25,818
of extraterrestrial
bulls eye!

294
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:26,981
That's pretty weird, eh?

295
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,095
There's gotta be some kind
of connection in the cosmos.

296
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:31,158
I mean this is not
just a coincidence.

297
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:33,547
Yeah, I'm sure there is
some sort of explanation.

298
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:35,683
Well, there's just
something in Smallville...

299
00:18:35,683 --> 00:18:37,941
that is screaming
for celestial attention.

300
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:40,046
I mean, lightening not strike
twice in the same place...

301
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:42,681
without some kind
of lightning rod, right?

302
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:43,913
I just wonder
what that is.

303
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:46,503
I-I'm not sure, but we
don't much time,

304
00:18:46,503 --> 00:18:47,420
we need to find Lana.

305
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,232
You're right, and if
anyone can find her...

306
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:50,472
with moments to
spare, it's you, Clark.

307
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:52,782
Why did you say that?

308
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,454
I don't know, because
you have a way...

309
00:18:54,454 --> 00:18:55,901
of getting things
done in half the time...

310
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,132
a normal person
gets anything done.

311
00:18:57,132 --> 00:18:59,119
And I'm not normal?

312
00:18:59,336 --> 00:19:01,005
No, of course you
are normal, Clark.

313
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:02,245
You're as normal
as they come.

314
00:19:02,245 --> 00:19:03,587
Now, let's hurry
and to find Lana.

315
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:05,713
Looks, I'm sure she's
already out of town.

316
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:07,083
They've evacuated
half of the county.

317
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,610
They probably saw
her running in late...

318
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:09,478
and told her
to leave town.

319
00:19:09,478 --> 00:19:11,421
That's exactly you two
need to do, right now.

320
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:13,562
Thanks for the tip.
Now listen to me, Smallville,

321
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:15,363
If there's one thing that the
General has taught me...

322
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:17,252
is that you
cannot panic...

323
00:19:17,252 --> 00:19:18,749
in times of crisis.
Do you hear me?

324
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:19,784
Okay, whatever happens,

325
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,541
you have to stay calm.
You cannot panic.

326
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:22,569
Because if you
lose your cool...

327
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:24,624
Lois! What?
You're panicking.

328
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,261
Fine.

329
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,700
Clark, where the
hell have you been?

330
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:46,717
We gotta pack up.

331
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:47,929
I've been looking for
Lana everywhere.

332
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:48,890
I can't find her.

333
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,586
Sweetheart, she's probably
already been evacuated.

334
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:51,650
I want you to go up to
your room and pack...

335
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,131
everything that's
necessary.

336
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:54,599
Your mom and I will take
care of everything down here.

337
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:56,505
No, I gotta
do something first.

338
00:19:58,135 --> 00:20:00,180
Don't think for a
second this is your fault.

339
00:20:01,022 --> 00:20:03,558
I came to Smallville
in a meteor shower.

340
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:05,600
Now it's happening again
and it's all because of me.

341
00:20:05,698 --> 00:20:06,960
Clark, there is
absolutely nothing you...

342
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,984
could have done
to prevent this.

343
00:20:07,984 --> 00:20:08,900
We don't know that.

344
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,152
There's gotta be
something I can do.

345
00:20:10,152 --> 00:20:12,348
Clark, you don't have time.

346
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,710
I don't have a choice.

347
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,460
Lex, what are
you doing here?

348
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:50,394
I wanted to offer to
you and your parents...

349
00:20:50,394 --> 00:20:53,313
a safe passage out of
here in a LuthorCorp jet.

350
00:20:53,313 --> 00:20:54,925
The roads will be
pretty ugly soon.

351
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:58,053
Thanks, but I think
we'll be okay.

352
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:04,346
Clark, why take the risk?

353
00:21:04,702 --> 00:21:06,353
The first meteor
shower caused me...

354
00:21:06,353 --> 00:21:08,003
irrevocable damage.
Trust me,

355
00:21:08,003 --> 00:21:09,989
you don't want to be near
here when the next one hits.

356
00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:11,286
Thanks, Lex, but
I think my dad's...

357
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:11,987
gonna wanna
pack up the truck...

358
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:13,421
with as much
as we can take.

359
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:15,747
I understand.

360
00:21:15,747 --> 00:21:18,747
Some things simply
can't be replaced.

361
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:24,181
Clark, my scientists
have identified...

362
00:21:24,181 --> 00:21:25,406
what seems to be
an inner chamber...

363
00:21:25,406 --> 00:21:27,734
inside the cave wall.

364
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:29,776
Really?

365
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:31,799
I was wondering if your
research into the cave...

366
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,732
might have turned up
anything similar.

367
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:36,758
No. Lex, why are
you so interested...

368
00:21:36,758 --> 00:21:37,507
in the caves
when there's...

369
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:39,510
a natural disaster
headed our way?

370
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:41,606
Clark, if anything in this
town is irreplaceable...

371
00:21:41,606 --> 00:21:43,672
it's those caves.

372
00:21:43,672 --> 00:21:45,602
They've been around
for thousands of years...

373
00:21:45,602 --> 00:21:47,000
and they can very well be
destroyed in the next...

374
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,779
Well, let's hope
they're not.

375
00:21:49,048 --> 00:21:51,626
I really need to get to help
my parents. Good luck, Lex.

376
00:21:52,984 --> 00:21:55,779
Thanks, Clark, but
I don't believe in luck.

377
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,575
It's our wits and our
fortitude to keep us safe.

378
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,687
And I'm sure you have
more than enough of both.

379
00:22:06,776 --> 00:22:08,322
Stay safe.

380
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,085
You're my father.

381
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,238
Talk to me.

382
00:22:32,045 --> 00:22:33,572
Tell me what you've done!

383
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,968
"It was you who brought
this upon yourself, Kal-El. "

384
00:22:39,143 --> 00:22:40,364
What did I do?

385
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:43,060
"I sent you here to
unite the 3 elements. "

386
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,399
The stones? They have
nothing to do with me!

387
00:22:46,547 --> 00:22:49,363
"But they do, Kal-El.
For the knowledge...

388
00:22:49,363 --> 00:22:51,258
of the universe is
meant for you only. "

389
00:22:51,826 --> 00:22:54,209
"Yet you chose
to deny your heritage. "

390
00:22:54,502 --> 00:22:57,436
"Today, you will witness
the consequences. "

391
00:22:57,436 --> 00:22:59,229
Then you send
the meteor shower?

392
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:01,473
"I have done nothing, Kal-El.

393
00:23:01,473 --> 00:23:04,225
"Human blood has
stained one of the elements...

394
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:05,981
and awakened
a great danger...

395
00:23:05,981 --> 00:23:07,519
from the darkness
of the space. "

396
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,329
What can I do to stop it?

397
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:11,002
"There is nothing
you can do...

398
00:23:11,002 --> 00:23:13,359
to prevent what is
already in motion. "

399
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,119
"But the meteor shower
is just beginning, Kal-El. "

400
00:23:16,154 --> 00:23:18,552
"I warned you that the
elements could not fall"

401
00:23:18,592 --> 00:23:23,281
"into the hands of a human.
The three must become one. "

402
00:23:23,796 --> 00:23:26,797
"It is the only way to save
Earth from total annihilation. "

403
00:23:26,797 --> 00:23:31,645
I don't know where they are!
I don't have time to find them!

404
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:35,454
"If you don't unite them
at once, you, my son,"

405
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,484
"will be seared by
a fire from the sky"

406
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:42,484
"even you can't survive.
The future of mankind"

407
00:23:42,485 --> 00:23:45,464
"rests in your hands, Kal-El. "

408
00:23:45,464 --> 00:23:48,620
Please.. help me!
I can't do this alone!

409
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:07,778
I can't believe
I almost forgot this!

410
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:09,490
That's great,
sweetheart,

411
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,417
I almost have the
truck all loaded up.

412
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:11,191
Great.

413
00:24:12,573 --> 00:24:13,678
Shelby, load up.

414
00:24:15,084 --> 00:24:19,156
Clark, great. Would you
help me secure the truck?

415
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:22,366
You have to
go without me.

416
00:24:22,366 --> 00:24:23,549
What?

417
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,043
Do I have to
remind you, Clark,

418
00:24:27,044 --> 00:24:28,443
that the last time we
had a meteor shower,

419
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,873
was full of kryptonite.

420
00:24:29,874 --> 00:24:31,613
If the same happens
today it could kill you.

421
00:24:31,613 --> 00:24:33,613
You have to
come with us.

422
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:35,678
I spoke to Jor-El.

423
00:24:40,258 --> 00:24:42,602
He told me I have to find the
other two stones right now.

424
00:24:43,053 --> 00:24:44,482
And unite them with
the one in the cave.

425
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:47,600
No.
You are my son.

426
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,746
You're not gonna go on
some kind of suicide mission.

427
00:24:49,746 --> 00:24:51,509
Clark, you might be
stronger than steel,

428
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:52,502
but you're not invincible.

429
00:24:52,502 --> 00:24:56,743
I know, dad. But I'm the
only one who can do this.

430
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:10,860
All right.

431
00:25:15,011 --> 00:25:18,100
But I want you to listen
to me right now.

432
00:25:18,706 --> 00:25:21,500
All the years that
your mother and I...

433
00:25:21,578 --> 00:25:23,900
spent raising
you from that...

434
00:25:23,915 --> 00:25:25,955
wide-eyed tattler running
around on this farm...

435
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,753
to the man who is standing
in front of me right now...

436
00:25:31,437 --> 00:25:33,273
was for this moment.

437
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,828
You do this, son.
You make us proud.

438
00:26:20,427 --> 00:26:22,701
Those meteors can
kill him, Jonathan.

439
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,787
I know that, sweetheart.

440
00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:31,817
But we have
faith in our son,

441
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:34,239
then we can't let
that faith waver now.

442
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:50,835
Lana, I thought you
already evacuated.

443
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:52,600
Are you okay?

444
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:54,048
I'm scared.

445
00:26:56,184 --> 00:26:57,435
Lana, I know this
meteor shower...

446
00:26:57,436 --> 00:26:59,456
must bring up some
painful memories for you...

447
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:01,116
but this time is different.

448
00:27:01,116 --> 00:27:03,309
We have warning
and we'll be safe.

449
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:05,912
No, I'm not so sure.

450
00:27:05,913 --> 00:27:08,112
Clark, I don't know what's
going to happen to me.

451
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:10,746
I want you to have this.

452
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,488
Where did you get this?

453
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:33,415
In China.

454
00:27:36,474 --> 00:27:39,574
Whatever it is,
whatever it means, I...

455
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,023
I somehow know
that it's meant for you.

456
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,445
Is this blood?

457
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,540
Remembers all those
times that I asked you...

458
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:54,330
for an explanation, but you
said you couldn't me one.

459
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,363
That I had to trust you?

460
00:27:58,408 --> 00:28:00,600
Well, this time
I need you to trust me.

461
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:06,122
Lana, my parents are
about to leave right now.

462
00:28:06,123 --> 00:28:07,713
Go with them.
You'll be safe.

463
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,251
I can't.
You have to.

464
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,496
Clark, I need you to know...

465
00:28:14,497 --> 00:28:17,452
that whatever happens,
I will never forget you.

466
00:28:23,924 --> 00:28:25,206
Lana, you're talking like
we never gonna see...

467
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:26,406
each other again.

468
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:30,886
I love you.

469
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:47,713
I love you, too.

470
00:28:51,492 --> 00:28:53,659
Good-bye.

471
00:29:13,992 --> 00:29:16,334
Chloe, even though you
won't hear from me for a while,

472
00:29:16,335 --> 00:29:18,371
I want you to know
that I'm okay.

473
00:29:18,766 --> 00:29:21,265
I thought we'd agreed you
wouldn't talk to anyone.

474
00:29:21,266 --> 00:29:22,925
I have to let my friends
know that I'm all right.

475
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,598
Lana, I understand you
not want anyone to worry,

476
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,585
but you have to trust me.

477
00:29:26,695 --> 00:29:28,839
Now, I assume the
stone is still safe.

478
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:31,249
As safe as can be.

479
00:29:32,212 --> 00:29:35,439
Well, let's keep it this way.
I'll put it in my vault.

480
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:37,283
Why?

481
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,601
A chopper is being fueled to
evacuate you to Metropolis,

482
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:45,593
where you'll stay at a hotel
until your lawyer arrives.

483
00:29:45,593 --> 00:29:48,145
It's probably best not to travel
with the murder weapon.

484
00:29:48,465 --> 00:29:51,092
I understand that, Lex,
but I'd rather hold on to it.

485
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:58,495
Lana, that object is what
prosecutors fondly refer to...

486
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,422
as the smoking gun.

487
00:30:00,422 --> 00:30:02,894
Now, I'll do anything
I can to protect you...

488
00:30:02,895 --> 00:30:04,074
including supporting
whatever...

489
00:30:04,092 --> 00:30:06,207
story of self-defense
you want to run with.

490
00:30:08,424 --> 00:30:10,924
It's not a story, Lex.

491
00:30:12,072 --> 00:30:15,072
I would never
murder somebody.

492
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:18,571
Of course not.

493
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:27,165
Lana, I trust you.

494
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:30,001
Now you have to trust
me with that stone.

495
00:30:32,862 --> 00:30:36,427
Sorry, Lex,
but I can't do that.

496
00:30:57,926 --> 00:30:59,011
Jason?

497
00:31:02,311 --> 00:31:03,599
Jason!

498
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,923
Shelby, no.

499
00:31:08,923 --> 00:31:11,423
I'm having what you
could call a rough day.

500
00:31:12,346 --> 00:31:15,373
Why don't you just
calm down, son?

501
00:31:16,355 --> 00:31:18,213
Where is Clark?

502
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:23,086
He's not here.

503
00:31:23,087 --> 00:31:24,981
Look, why don't you
put down the shotgun,

504
00:31:24,981 --> 00:31:26,981
and we'll talk about it?

505
00:31:28,668 --> 00:31:29,887
Tell me where he is!

506
00:31:59,171 --> 00:31:59,970
Why would Lana be
at the Lex's mansion...

507
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,632
when she's suppose
to evacuate?

508
00:32:01,632 --> 00:32:02,812
I don't know,
but it could swear...

509
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:04,691
that was Lex's voice
in the background.

510
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:06,334
She sounds like
she's in trouble, Lois.

511
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:07,476
I can't abandon
her, I mean,

512
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:09,266
the mansion is
just around that bend.

513
00:32:09,266 --> 00:32:11,178
Unless you have a
jet pack in your purse...

514
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,144
we're not going anywhere.

515
00:32:15,675 --> 00:32:16,662
Emergency vehicles only.

516
00:32:16,662 --> 00:32:18,502
Turn the car
around immediately.

517
00:32:18,502 --> 00:32:20,400
Well, our friend could
be trapped inside.

518
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:21,839
We just gonna go grab her
and then come right back.

519
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,564
I'm sorry, mam.
Nobody gets trough.

520
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:28,917
We're way too
close to turn away.

521
00:32:33,005 --> 00:32:34,797
Hey, soldier!

522
00:32:36,972 --> 00:32:38,289
Is this a road block or...

523
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,289
a lemonade stand
you got here?

524
00:32:41,582 --> 00:32:42,818
Wait a second,
I recognize you.

525
00:32:42,818 --> 00:32:43,518
You're the...

526
00:32:43,518 --> 00:32:45,687
Daughter of General Lane.
You might have heard of him.

527
00:32:45,688 --> 00:32:47,858
He talks really loud,
smokes a stogy.

528
00:32:49,063 --> 00:32:50,070
Hey!

529
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,586
Hey, this barricade...

530
00:32:53,586 --> 00:32:55,170
it should be
perpendicular to the road.

531
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:57,379
Those channelizers
should be further apart...

532
00:32:57,381 --> 00:33:00,122
and, unless I need glasses,

533
00:33:00,122 --> 00:33:02,000
there should be
reflectors on those cones.

534
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,805
Yes, mam, I understand,
but I can't let you trough.

535
00:33:06,494 --> 00:33:08,151
You're a cub scout
out here soldier.

536
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:11,151
Where's your den mother?
Baking brownies?

537
00:33:37,656 --> 00:33:39,807
What happened to your
survival instincts, dad?

538
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:42,148
Fire and brimstone are
about to rain down...

539
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:43,873
from the sky and you're
sipping a cocktail...

540
00:33:43,873 --> 00:33:45,688
like it's Sunday
at the country club.

541
00:33:45,781 --> 00:33:48,356
I am aware of the
imminent danger, Lex,

542
00:33:48,357 --> 00:33:49,464
but I'm not
about to leave...

543
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:51,995
without knowing that
my son is all right...

544
00:33:51,995 --> 00:33:53,328
Come on, who's
kidding who?

545
00:33:53,328 --> 00:33:55,728
You're not about to leave
without the element.

546
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:58,178
I hate to disappoint you,

547
00:33:58,178 --> 00:33:59,983
but I haven't even
seen Lana Lang.

548
00:33:59,983 --> 00:34:02,183
She's probably on the run...

549
00:34:02,188 --> 00:34:03,736
halfway to
Costa Rica by now.

550
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:06,316
Oh, a face like Lana
Lang's isn't easy to hide.

551
00:34:06,318 --> 00:34:07,637
It's just a matter
of time before...

552
00:34:07,637 --> 00:34:10,355
she catches the attention
of some customs official.

553
00:34:18,815 --> 00:34:20,610
All right.

554
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:24,473
Agree to leave
her alone,

555
00:34:24,474 --> 00:34:26,958
and I'll give you something
you desperately need.

556
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:30,133
I am a blessed man, Lex,
I need very little in life.

557
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:31,522
I wonder,

558
00:34:31,522 --> 00:34:35,317
what good is a key if you
don't know where the lock is?

559
00:34:35,317 --> 00:34:36,621
Wise observation,

560
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:38,150
why do you think any
of this applies to me?

561
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,823
You have one of
the elements, dad.

562
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:40,574
That much is clear.

563
00:34:40,574 --> 00:34:44,676
What you don't have is the
knowledge of where it belongs.

564
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,328
I can help you, take
you there right now.

565
00:34:48,328 --> 00:34:51,901
I wish I'd were true, Lex,
but I don't have the stone.

566
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:49,459
Mr. Luthor,
what happened?

567
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:54,702
Get J.D and take
my father upstairs.

568
00:35:54,702 --> 00:35:56,627
Mr. Luthor we're evacuating...
Do it!

569
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,157
Can you hear me, dad?

570
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,871
Before you leave this
earth, I want you to know...

571
00:36:15,112 --> 00:36:17,959
You did create the
son you always wanted.

572
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:42,518
Come on, hurry up!

573
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,160
Jason, why don't
you let Martha go?

574
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,713
She doesn't know
anything about any of this.

575
00:37:45,713 --> 00:37:48,414
Oh, a mother always knows
her sons deep, dark secrets.

576
00:37:48,449 --> 00:37:50,256
Now, where does
he keeps the stones?

577
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:51,414
Why would Clark
know anything...

578
00:37:51,414 --> 00:37:52,777
about ancient stones?

579
00:37:52,777 --> 00:37:55,040
All right.
Let's see,

580
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:57,418
when I ran into your
son in Shanghai,

581
00:37:57,792 --> 00:38:00,400
I decided to do a little
homework on my own.

582
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,930
And the more I dogged the
more Clark Kent's name...

583
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,930
just got popping up.

584
00:38:05,556 --> 00:38:08,929
Sit down!
Was it coincidence...

585
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:11,119
that the symbols were
burned into your field?

586
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,286
I don't know what
you're talking.

587
00:38:12,286 --> 00:38:13,286
Jason!

588
00:38:14,678 --> 00:38:16,300
What about Clark's connection
with Bridgette Crosby?

589
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:18,045
I don't know.
I don't know.

590
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,325
She had one
of the artifacts!

591
00:38:19,761 --> 00:38:22,182
I suppose that was
just a coincidence, too.

592
00:38:22,363 --> 00:38:24,052
None of that makes
any difference now.

593
00:38:26,018 --> 00:38:28,243
You know, when my
mother came to Smallville...

594
00:38:28,244 --> 00:38:30,469
she thought the Luthors
would lead her to the stones...

595
00:38:31,418 --> 00:38:34,827
But she was wrong.
It was a farm boy.

596
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:39,100
The one who has no
record of ever been born.

597
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,094
He's more connected to
those stones than any of us.

598
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:43,638
There is a meteor shower
about to tear this town apart!

599
00:38:43,638 --> 00:38:45,999
You need to get to your
mother, get her to safety!

600
00:38:46,162 --> 00:38:49,356
Don't you think I know that?
I can't find her anywhere!

601
00:38:53,222 --> 00:38:55,707
But I'll tell you one thing.
When I do find my mother,

602
00:38:56,782 --> 00:38:58,503
I finally be able to give
her the one thing...

603
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:00,531
she's been searching
for all these years.

604
00:39:06,191 --> 00:39:08,267
Now tell me where
the stones are!

605
00:39:18,305 --> 00:39:21,046
I'll meet you in Metropolis.
What? You're not coming?

606
00:39:22,114 --> 00:39:24,556
I have a pressing
matter to take care of.

607
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,610
Now, Lana,
for your own safety:

608
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,610
I need that stone.

609
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,081
Look, we all have a need
to cling on to things,

610
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:34,230
but eventually...

611
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,634
you have to
loosen your grip.

612
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:37,399
It's too dangerous to you.

613
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:39,146
I don't have it!

614
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:41,345
Lies don't become you.

615
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,227
It's the truth, Lex.
I don't have it.

616
00:39:43,227 --> 00:39:45,595
Trust me it's safe,
I promise!

617
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:47,105
Where is it?

618
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,118
That was never about
my safety, was it?

619
00:39:51,995 --> 00:39:55,067
This is about you getting
your hands on that stone!

620
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:06,534
Lana... your safety is more
important than any of this.

621
00:40:09,738 --> 00:40:12,265
You mean a lot more
to me than you know.

622
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:16,100
We can't wait any
longer, Mr. Luthor.

623
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,100
We got to go!

624
00:40:43,534 --> 00:40:45,948
Lana?
Lana?

625
00:40:52,347 --> 00:40:53,701
Oh my God, Clark.

626
00:41:16,443 --> 00:41:19,375
Lex, I was
looking for Lana.

627
00:41:19,537 --> 00:41:22,361
She's already left.
What happened?

628
00:41:22,663 --> 00:41:24,339
I don't know,
I just walked in.

629
00:41:27,514 --> 00:41:29,045
You know more than
you're telling me, Chloe.

630
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,800
Who did this?

631
00:41:31,866 --> 00:41:34,660
Lex, honestly, I just
came to find Lana.

632
00:41:35,998 --> 00:41:38,331
Your curiosity seems
to always have a way...

633
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:40,096
of landing you in
precarious conditions.

634
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:43,033
Only this time you are on
a very narrow ledge...

635
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,365
with only one-way back!

636
00:41:44,365 --> 00:41:46,141
Now, who took
the element?

637
00:41:46,456 --> 00:41:48,777
Lex, I swear it, I don't know
what you're talking about.

638
00:41:49,294 --> 00:41:50,800
But I think we need to
get out of Smallville...

639
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:51,932
before the meteor
shower hits.

640
00:41:51,932 --> 00:41:53,574
We'll find that
stone, Chloe,

641
00:41:53,574 --> 00:41:56,547
even if that means dodging
a few meteors in the process.

642
00:41:57,094 --> 00:41:58,036
You're coming with me.

643
00:41:58,037 --> 00:41:59,627
I don't...
Let's go!

644
00:41:59,735 --> 00:42:01,479
Lex, I don't know what
you're talking about.

645
00:42:06,728 --> 00:42:07,498
I swear to God,

646
00:42:07,498 --> 00:42:10,498
if you don't start talking
I'm gonna blow her brains out.

647
00:42:12,289 --> 00:42:13,268
Sweetheart,
it's no good.

648
00:42:13,268 --> 00:42:14,566
Go ahead, tell him
what he wants to know.

649
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:15,749
Tell him where
the stones are.

650
00:42:21,286 --> 00:42:22,795
Tell me what
I want to know.

651
00:42:24,954 --> 00:42:28,495
Go upstairs to
Clark's room.

652
00:44:01,312 --> 00:44:02,907
Oh my God.

653
00:44:51,178 --> 00:44:52,704
You're not my daddy.

654
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,052
Come here, come here.
Daddy!

655
00:44:58,251 --> 00:45:01,065
Go! Go!

656
00:45:02,124 --> 00:45:03,742
Thank you.
Thank you!

657
00:46:33,478 --> 00:46:35,785
Why do I get the feeling we're
not in this cave for cover?

658
00:46:35,785 --> 00:46:38,775
You know as well as do.
It's the epicenter.

659
00:46:38,868 --> 00:46:41,656
Of what?
Come on, Chloe!

660
00:46:41,657 --> 00:46:44,639
You're the town purvey
of all things unexplained!

661
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,044
You know damn well about
this cave and the stones.

662
00:46:47,044 --> 00:46:48,327
Lex, what's
wrong with you?

663
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:50,998
If you didn't break into my
library, you know who did?

664
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:53,251
Who are you
trying to protect?

665
00:46:53,253 --> 00:46:55,405
No one.
Is it Clark?

666
00:46:55,676 --> 00:46:58,587
Clark?
Of course not.

667
00:46:58,587 --> 00:47:00,023
What does Clark have
to do with any of this?

668
00:47:00,023 --> 00:47:01,018
You tell me.

669
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,587
You know Clark a lot
longer than I have.

670
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,882
In fact, you might know
him better than anyone.

671
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,675
You are right, Lex, I do.
And the Clark Kent I know...

672
00:47:09,005 --> 00:47:10,514
would be the last
person to go super thief...

673
00:47:10,514 --> 00:47:13,514
on your library for some
stupid piece of rock.

674
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:28,780
What is that?

675
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:39,580
Lex, be careful.
It might be dangerous.

676
00:52:00,921 --> 00:52:05,332
To be continued...
