1
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,565
Tyler.

2
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:45,970
-I missed you.
-Missed you too, Mom.

3
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,743
Did you get my postcards?

4
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,816
I didn't think you'd come.

5
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,451
-I'm getting the doctor.
-Wait, Tyler.

6
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,857
I asked you to come home
for a reason.

7
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,528
I need you to help me.

8
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,905
I want you to help me die, Tyler.

9
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,840
Don't talk like that,
you're gonna get well.

10
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:24,109
I want to be buried back home,
in Smallville.

11
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,252
You have to be strong, Mom.

12
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,121
I can't fight this anymore.

13
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:38,895
If you love me, you'll do this for me.

14
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,671
I love you, Mom.

15
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,643
And I love you, Tyler.

16
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:57,036
Oh, my God, security!
Get me security now!

17
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,609
Get away from her!

18
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,507
-She was in pain!
-What's going on?

19
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,942
I think he killed her.

20
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,375
Let go! Let go! Let go!

21
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:19,888
Tyler Randall, male Caucasian.
Body has multiple fracture injuries...

22
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:23,558
...consistent with a high fall
of more than 20 feet.

23
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:28,363
Subject's neck is broken
just below the axis.

24
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:33,000
What've we got here? Let's see.

25
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,773
Man, that's gotta hurt.

26
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:50,389
Subject has unknown rock fragment...

27
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:56,363
...wedged between the brachioradialis
and the flexors of the right forearm.

28
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,968
Come on, come on.

29
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,869
Possibly the result of impact.

30
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,678
Okay, Tyler, let's take a look
under the hood.

31
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,950
Well, here we are.

32
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:01,992
I'm only asking for two hours! I'm sorry
to cut into your busy social schedule.

33
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:05,130
It's not that. I don't mind helping
out for a good cause...

34
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,766
-...it's just all these people are--
-Old and sick?

35
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,167
It's hard to deal with.
There's nothing we can do.

36
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,135
You're right, you can't save them
from old age and illness...

37
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,367
...but that's not the point.
You're saving them from loneliness.

38
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,574
Don't forget the irises.

39
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,338
You excited about the big fishing trip
with your dad next weekend?

40
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,848
You didn't forget, did you?

41
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,578
How could I? We've been
going every year since I was 7.

42
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,918
Ten hours in a rowboat, swatting
mosquitoes, looking for ripples.

43
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,787
-I thought you enjoyed fishing.
-I did when I was younger.

44
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,226
-lf you don't want to go, tell him.
-I don't want to hurt his feelings.

45
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,026
He may not like it,
but he needs to know.

46
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:46,770
Martha, Clark, I'd like you to meet
Tyler Randall, new volunteer.

47
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,964
-I want you to show him the ropes.
-Hi.

48
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,973
Hank says you grow the best
organic produce outside Metropolis.

49
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,479
-You just made a friend for life.
-So, what brings you to Smallville?

50
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,777
I came back to make funeral
preparations. I recently lost my mother.

51
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,880
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

52
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,249
Why don't we get to the deliveries?

53
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,154
We can start with Mrs. Sikes.
She'll be happy to see us.

54
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:11,160
-Her dog Pepper, on the other hand....
-Pepper's not so bad.

55
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:18,196
Hi, Pepper, hi! How are you today?
Pepper, this is Tyler.

56
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,268
Don't worry, she's probably hungry.

57
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,841
I'll get her something to eat.

58
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,275
A lot of our clients are elderly
and housebound, like Mrs. Sikes.

59
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,339
Good morning, Mrs. Sikes.
How are you feeling today?

60
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:31,915
Terrible.

61
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:37,354
-Is that Clark? He looks different.
-No, this is Tyler, our new driver.

62
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,956
Let me.

63
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,089
How about some lunch, Mrs. Sikes?

64
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,525
-What's wrong?
-It hurts.

65
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:54,302
-My pills, give me my, get my--
-Isn't there anything we can do for her?

66
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,798
I wish there were.

67
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:02,640
One of Mrs. Kent's beautiful irises.
For a beautiful lady.

68
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,580
Don't ever get old and sick, son.

69
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,387
The world got no use for you.

70
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,819
I'll tell you what.

71
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,065
I'll bring you another iris tomorrow.

72
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:26,503
I like roses. White ones.

73
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,470
White ones it is.

74
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,503
I like this one, Martha.

75
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:43,316
Your father's very disappointed
with you, Lex.

76
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:48,252
My father's disappointment is perennial,
only the circumstances change.

77
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,917
What do you want, Dominic?

78
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:55,966
An internal audit of your division has
turned up accounting irregularities.

79
00:08:56,135 --> 00:09:00,003
And I've been authorized to come down
and go through it in a thorough manner.

80
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:06,601
So this is payback for turning down my
father's offer to join him in Metropolis.

81
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,306
Lionel has been very tolerant
of your excesses.

82
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:14,544
But this time you didn't spend
the money on parties and sports cars.

83
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,847
He wants to know where it went.

84
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,091
Do you know what my father gave me
for my 10th birthday?

85
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,661
A copy of <i>The Will to Power.</i>

86
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:29,561
"Behold the superman.
Man is something to be overcome."

87
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,764
Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, Nietzsche...

88
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,501
...they were the voices that
nurtured me after my mother died.

89
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:41,370
My father made every question a quiz.
Every choice a test.

90
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,777
Second best was for losers.
Compassion, for the weak. Trust no one.

91
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,886
Those are the lessons I grew up with.

92
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:52,190
I'll remember that if I'm ever
interviewed by the Biography Channel.

93
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:59,388
All I'm saying, Dominic, is try
and remember who I was raised by.

94
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,962
I try to deny it,
but I'm still my father's son.

95
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,961
Tread carefully.

96
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,398
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

97
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,475
Looks like a real page-turner.

98
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,211
My father and I have
our annual fishing trip.

99
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:25,448
Of course you do. My father
and I went on a fishing trip once.

100
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:30,085
-He doesn't seem like the fishing type.
-He's not. We were the bait.

101
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:35,523
We flew to South Australia, got up-close
and personal with a couple of great whites.

102
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,896
Sounds like a real Kodak moment.

103
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,302
When you're rich and untouchable like he is,
you do things to make yourself feel alive.

104
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,806
Why'd you go?

105
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,935
Because he didn't think I would. We
never went on another father-son trip.

106
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,708
I wish my father would do something
other than fishing.

107
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,612
How about a football game?

108
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:56,221
I've got two tickets for the skybox at
the Metropolis Sharks game Sunday.

109
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:57,852
They're yours.

110
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,686
That'd be great. My father's followed
the team all season.

111
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,057
-I wouldn't even have to twist his arm.
-Problem solved.

112
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,910
Lana, what is it?

113
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:27,510
That was Whitney's mom,
his dad just had another heart attack.

114
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,305
Whoa, whoa!

115
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,873
It is not a good idea to sneak up on
somebody with an acetylene torch.

116
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,642
I'm sorry. My name's Dominic Senatori,
I work for Lionel Luthor.

117
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:04,952
I'm here following up on a research
project Lex Luthor recently instigated.

118
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:08,116
If you don't mind, I've got
a lot of work to do around here.

119
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:13,823
There was an incident involving your
son and Lex's Porsche and a bridge.

120
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:17,696
Lex has spent a considerable amount of
time and capital researching the crash...

121
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,963
...and I was wondering
if you knew why.

122
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,472
Look, the truth is, Lex Luthor
was driving like a maniac.

123
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,633
His car went off the bridge
into the water...

124
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:29,508
...my son jumped in, risked his life to
save him, that's the end of the story.

125
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,446
You wouldn't know why he
commissioned an in-depth profile...

126
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,518
...into you and your family.

127
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,526
I have no idea.

128
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,730
Fair enough, Mr. Kent.
Thanks for your time.

129
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:54,069
Just out of curiosity, what were
Lex's findings on the crash?

130
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,582
Whitney, is that you?

131
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,478
It's Clark Kent, Mr. Fordman.

132
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,055
Lana.

133
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,987
Well, where's Whitney?
I haven't seen my son yet.

134
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,725
Don't worry, he'll be here soon.

135
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:28,362
-Where is Whitney?
-I don't know.

136
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,072
His mom said he'd be here.

137
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,717
Clark, how's Whitney's dad?

138
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,452
-He's hanging in there.
-That's good.

139
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,465
-You remember this?
-It's my first fishing rod.

140
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,625
You used to practice casting
it out in the paddock all day.

141
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,703
-I remember.
-In fact...

142
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:04,366
...I remember I used to have to pry it
out of your hands to get you to go to bed.

143
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,371
Dad, what would you say if we could
be sitting in the deluxe box...

144
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,482
...next Sunday watching
the Metropolis Sharks?

145
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,550
I'd say the Milk River's
changed quite a bit.

146
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,979
Think about it.

147
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,359
No worms, no cold mornings,
no eating canned peaches.

148
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,395
Wait a minute. Did Lex Luthor
arrange all this for us?

149
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:31,493
Clark, this morning I had a surprise
visit from one of Lionel Luthor's people.

150
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,333
Did you know Lex Luthor was having us
investigated after the bridge accident?

151
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,476
Yeah, but Lex said that was all
in our past. He promised.

152
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:47,642
-You knew and you didn't tell me?
-Because I knew you'd react like this.

153
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,085
I thought we had an understanding.

154
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,783
How am I to protect you
if you won't give me the facts?

155
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,452
-I don't need protection.
-When it comes to your secret you do.

156
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,293
When you get older,
you'll understand my apprehension...

157
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,163
-...about the Luthor family.
-Stop treating me like a kid.

158
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:07,305
I'm not 7 anymore,
I'm not casting lines in the paddock.

159
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:11,569
I don't even like fishing, the only reason
I do it is because it makes you happy!

160
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,249
That didn't come out right.

161
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,983
No, son, I think it did.

162
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,520
Pepper?

163
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,829
Pepper.

164
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,200
I brought you a white rose.

165
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:40,597
You've lived so long with pain.
Sometimes don't you wish it would just end?

166
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,560
Oh, yes.

167
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:48,238
I can't go on, not like this.

168
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,705
It'll all be over soon.

169
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,403
I promise.

170
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,877
Where's Dad?

171
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,848
He wanted to get an early start,
said he had a lot of work to do today.

172
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,211
He's avoiding me, isn't he?

173
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,356
I'm not gonna play referee.
You two need to work this out.

174
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,516
We will. First we'll have a week
of uncomfortable silence...

175
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:45,220
...then we'll talk about something
trivial. And then we'll move on.

176
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,498
Avoiding it and hoping the problem
goes away isn't dealing with it.

177
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,833
-You know how stubborn he can be.
-I know how stubborn you both can be.

178
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,531
I don't want you to drift apart...

179
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,268
-...like he did with his father.
-I thought they were close.

180
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,073
They were, but they kept things
from each other.

181
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,908
When your grandfather passed away...

182
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,883
...there was a lot your dad didn't
get to tell him, a lot he regrets.

183
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:12,114
I just don't want to see
history repeat itself.

184
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:23,834
Chloe, I just got your note. I can't
believe it. I just saw Mrs. Sikes yesterday.

185
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:27,165
-I know. I'm sorry, Clark.
-What happened?

186
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,305
The official story is, there was a fire.
But all they found were her ashes.

187
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,707
-And the unofficial?
-Spontaneous combustion.

188
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,074
She thinks the old lady
just burst into flames.

189
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:41,117
"October 1978. Joyce Maslow was
dancing in Elizabeth, New Jersey...

190
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,346
...when flames burst from her head
and back, enveloping her.

191
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,252
In seconds she was a human torch,
consumed before her horrified boyfriend."

192
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,591
-You don't have to look so happy.
-I'm not happy, I'm intrigued.

193
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,324
Which means you're still
gonna look into it.

194
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,765
-Am I that transparent?
-Yes.

195
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,204
Mr. Kent?

196
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:11,040
-Clark isn't here.
-Actually, I came to see you.

197
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,708
I was wondering if you're planning
on coming to the game next Sunday.

198
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:18,081
I'm going fishing, Lex,
I don't know what my son is doing.

199
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,694
-The tickets were meant as a gift.
-I'm sure your intentions were noble.

200
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:31,926
That's not fair. I don't think you understand
how I regard Clark and your family.

201
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,766
Yes I do, I understand perfectly well.

202
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,432
We're just the pawns in your eternal
chess game with your dad.

203
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,611
-Do you have a family photo?
-Yeah, I've got lots of family photos.

204
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:47,347
The only picture of my father and me
appears in the LuthorCorp annual report.

205
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,317
Is this the part where I'm supposed
to feel sorry for you?

206
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,481
No, I just want you to understand...

207
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,822
...if I'm guilty of anything
regarding your family, it's envy.

208
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,727
If you're so envious of my family,
then why do you feel the need...

209
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,527
...to investigate it behind my back?

210
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,970
I wanted to know what happened
the day of the accident.

211
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,743
I had a theory and it was false.
I was totally up-front with Clark about it.

212
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,505
That's what this is about.

213
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,980
-Clark wasn't up-front with you.
-He's a good kid.

214
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,585
-I don't want that to change.
-Neither do I.

215
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,157
You know...

216
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,855
...from the day I first met Clark,
all you've ever seen is the name Luthor.

217
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:36,728
Well, so far you haven't given
me a reason to see anything else.

218
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,842
See that Kansas State game last week?

219
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,354
What are you doing here, Clark?
Lana send you?

220
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,291
I told her you'd see it coming
a mile away.

221
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,188
Hey, I'm not angry.

222
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,831
So, you've come to find out
why the heartless son...

223
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,458
...hasn't gone by the hospital
to visit his dying father.

224
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,298
Something like that.

225
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,069
I remember how my dad used to say
how he'd be there the day...

226
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,475
...I threw my first pass for the Sharks.

227
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,511
-He said it so often, I actually believed it.
-He still could.

228
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,315
My father was the strongest man
I ever knew.

229
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,652
He lettered in three sports at State.

230
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:43,394
When I see him there
in the hospital so weak...

231
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,937
...it kills me because
that's not my father.

232
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:56,914
Whatever you do, for a long time to come,
your father is gonna be there to support you.

233
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,352
I'll only have a memory of my dad.

234
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,384
And I don't want that memory to be...

235
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:10,720
...of that sick man laying there
in the hospital.

236
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,594
Now I get it.

237
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:25,641
It's just.... I'd take the man over
the memory any day of the week.

238
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,623
Clark, I've been looking all over for you.
Look what I found in the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

239
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,988
-"Body Disappears From Metropolis Morgue"?
-Yeah, but look at the photo.

240
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,929
The coroner's body
was disintegrated into ash.

241
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,735
Just like Mrs. Sikes.

242
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:55,361
I don't know, but it would be nice
to check out that house for ourselves.

243
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,176
You know this is a crime scene.

244
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,783
So?

245
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,516
Well, there's no other sign
of fire damage anywhere.

246
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,592
You might want to dial back on that
"spontaneous combustion" skepticism.

247
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,093
-No barking.
-Wasn't planning on it.

248
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,655
-Pepper.
-Who's Pepper?

249
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,732
Mrs. Sikes' dog.

250
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,802
She turned into a barking
machine anytime somebody came over.

251
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,734
Pepper? Come here, girl.

252
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,397
Well, Animal Shelter probably
came and got her.

253
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,152
-Oh, no.
-Don't tell me that's Pepper.

254
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,709
What happened
may have been combustion...

255
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,579
...but I have a feeling
it wasn't spontaneous.

256
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,260
-Well, afternoon, Martha.
-Hi.

257
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,594
I didn't know that you
were volunteering today.

258
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,567
Dropping off some produce,
didn't want it to go to waste.

259
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:37,640
-Let me give you a hand with that.
-I've got it. Just close that for me.

260
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,141
All right. I'll be in the office
if you need me.

261
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,750
Tyler! What are you doing here?

262
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,121
Here, let me help you with this.

263
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,599
Mrs. Sikes. That was you.

264
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,937
-Martha, you okay?
-Hank, call the Sheriff.

265
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,102
What's going on here?
Hold it right there.

266
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,804
Hank, no!

267
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,242
Mom.

268
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,110
Get away from her.

269
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,307
Clark, don't touch him!

270
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,519
Clark, are you okay?

271
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,521
Son, your mom is.... She's resting.

272
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:36,527
She's pretty shaken up but
I think she's gonna be fine.

273
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,363
Police are looking everywhere for Tyler.

274
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:44,497
-I don't think they're gonna stop him.
-Why?

275
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,065
Because I saw his heart.
It wasn't beating.

276
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,802
Clark, that doesn't make any sense.
How can he walk around if he's dead?

277
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,413
How can he turn people to ash?

278
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:02,647
When he touched my face, I felt like
the life was being drained out of me.

279
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,513
-Clark, you sure that you--
-Yeah.

280
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,637
Dad?

281
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,908
Yeah?

282
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,838
Nothing.

283
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:01,868
Clark, I heard what happened
at Mobile Meals. Is your mom all right?

284
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,379
-Yeah.
-Can't believe Tyler would hurt anybody.

285
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,574
-He seemed so nice.
-lf you run into him...

286
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,015
...whatever you do,
don't let him touch you.

287
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,317
Long story, just trust me.

288
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:16,117
Whitney phoned. He wanted
to get together later and talk.

289
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:17,625
That's great.

290
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:21,797
I don't know what you said,
but thank you.

291
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,199
Gotta go.

292
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,104
Hi, Lana.

293
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:35,479
Clark, glad I ran into you. I need
to talk to you about the Sharks game.

294
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,575
-Is your dad coming?
-I'm not sure.

295
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,910
Funny. When I asked him,
he was pretty adamant he wasn't going.

296
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:49,325
I'm rescinding the offer.
Go fishing with your dad.

297
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,520
-Lex, you don't have to do that.
-I know.

298
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,961
But your dad wants
to spend some time with you.

299
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,328
It's not something
I want to come between.

300
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,562
He's just trying to give you
something my father never gave me.

301
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,934
-What's that?
-Limitations.

302
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:07,238
All my father ever told me was "Don't
get caught. Don't cause a scandal."

303
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,711
That's not love, that's public relations.

304
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,178
You have no idea how lucky you are.

305
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:17,287
When my father dies,
kings will come to his funeral.

306
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:21,448
But when yours does,
his friends will come.

307
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,043
Nell told me she saw
you come out here.

308
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,045
Yeah.

309
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:48,408
I just realized that in all the time
we've known each other...

310
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:53,054
-...l've never been here before.
-It's okay, Whitney.

311
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,085
No, it's not.

312
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:01,327
It's just, the thought of losing
my parents was so awful...

313
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,291
...I didn't want to think about it.

314
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:07,804
That's why you need
to talk to your father.

315
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:12,133
Go see him, Whitney. Make the best
of the time he has left.

316
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,521
Thanks, Lana.

317
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:31,794
I'm gonna go to the hospital.

318
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:36,431
-Do you want me to walk you home?
-Think I'm gonna stay.

319
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:39,368
Haven't been out here in a while.

320
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,671
Okay.

321
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,870
Whitney?

322
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,810
It's all right, I won't hurt you.

323
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:31,217
I don't want to hurt anyone, Lana.
I only want to bring them peace.

324
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:38,995
I heard your friend talking.
His father must be in terrible pain.

325
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,590
I can help your friend.

326
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:01,310
Then there's the discrepancy between
the purchasing and shipping records.

327
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:07,891
Stop. I know my father authorized this,
but enough bean-counting for one day.

328
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,127
Thirty-year-old single malt.

329
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:16,824
Also bought with my father's money.
Make sure you jot that down.

330
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:21,431
Let's be frank, Dominic. My father
sent you here to spy on me because...

331
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,369
...he's afraid of how well I'm doing.

332
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:27,910
This was my last chance to prove
myself and he just assumed I'd fail.

333
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,810
Now he has to revise
his definition of me.

334
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:34,314
I'm not just his screwup son anymore.

335
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,422
Now I'm competition. My father only knows
one way of dealing with competition.

336
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,560
There are some things better left
between patient and therapist, Lex.

337
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,694
You know, in ancient Persia...

338
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:55,930
...the kings would kill a messenger who
brought them news they didn't like.

339
00:32:56,774 --> 00:33:01,541
In modern times, a sword in the chest
might seem a little extreme...

340
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,409
...something more subtle
would be in order.

341
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,543
Enjoying your drink?

342
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,363
That's disgusting.

343
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:28,528
I guess I should have mentioned the
"May not be suitable for all ages" disclaimer.

344
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:31,106
-Your friend Tyler's been busy.
-What do you mean?

345
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:36,474
He tried to kill his mother, rose from
the dead, and escaped from the morgue.

346
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:41,976
My buddy Chad works weekends for the
M.E. He zip-filed the toxicology report.

347
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,587
Besides that fatal amount
of painkillers...

348
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:48,021
...they found fragments of an unknown
green stone embedded in his skin.

349
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,389
Meteor rocks.

350
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:53,553
Then why aren't all Smallville's dead bodies
rising from the grave?

351
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:58,766
The combo of painkillers and meteor
rocks caused Tyler to pull a "Thriller."

352
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:01,166
Didn't you say Tyler
tried to kill his mother?

353
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:05,202
Tried and failed. His mother
recovered enough to be sent home.

354
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:08,676
-Clark, I just left Tyler in the graveyard.
-Are you okay?

355
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:12,475
He heard Whitney talking about his
father, he said he could bring him peace.

356
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,411
Did you call the police?

357
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,446
Where are you going?

358
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,989
Don't look at me,
he does that all the time.

359
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,949
-Dad?
-He can't hear you.

360
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:01,891
-Who are you?
-I've come to help your father. And you.

361
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,174
I can end your pain.

362
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,140
I know what you're feeling...

363
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,448
...how much it hurts.

364
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,519
But I can make it all go away.

365
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,400
Tyler, don't!

366
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:49,745
I heard your friend, Clark. Seeing his
father like this is tearing him apart.

367
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:52,943
-I can give them peace.
-It's not your decision.

368
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,715
You're wrong. I have to help him.

369
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,419
You're not taking away their pain.

370
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:08,121
You're stealing Whitney's
last chance to be with his father.

371
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,694
You can't stop me, Clark.

372
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,693
No one can.

373
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:17,364
Don't you see? It's better. I know,
I could see it in my mother's eyes.

374
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,407
Your mother's alive.

375
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:25,015
She recovered after that night.
They brought her home to Smallville.

376
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,010
-I thought--
-She's alive, Tyler.

377
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,154
Let me take you to her.

378
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,768
It's a miracle.

379
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,735
It's life. As long as
we have that, there's still hope.

380
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,509
She seems so peaceful.

381
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:06,253
I thought that I was brought back
to relieve the suffering of others.

382
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,425
But it was my pain all along.

383
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,763
-What have I done?
-Tyler.

384
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,137
I just want it all to be over.

385
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,179
Tyler?

386
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:54,034
Interesting choice of location
for a meeting, Lex.

387
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,734
Why didn't you come up
to the penthouse?

388
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:04,312
I was making a garbage delivery,
I didn't want to tarnish the marble.

389
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,245
I'm not in the mood to joust, Lex.

390
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,642
I was hoping you'd
explain Dominic's visit.

391
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:14,018
My auditors discovered unaccounted
expenditures coming out of Smallville.

392
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,625
-I thought it prudent to investigate.
-Come on, Dad.

393
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:20,457
I've squandered more in a weekend. You
didn't sic your adding machines on me then.

394
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:24,931
No, we're talking corporate finances,
Lex, not your pocket money.

395
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:27,036
It bothers you, doesn't it?

396
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,138
That I'm not dependent on you anymore.

397
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,799
That I've made friends in Smallville,
people I trust.

398
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,242
Don't be ridiculous, Lex.
I'm happy you're doing well.

399
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:40,612
No, you're not. You're afraid
I won't need you anymore.

400
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,748
You'll always be my son.

401
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:54,364
And you will always need me, Lex.

402
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:58,057
Aren't you going to ask about Dominic?

403
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:04,332
He hasn't checked in for hours, has he?
Unusual for a man of his predictable nature.

404
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,307
Go ahead...

405
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,083
...pop the trunk.

406
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:18,586
Ah, Lex, what has he done,
what has he done?

407
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:34,360
You want to ask an accounting question,
Dad? Call me.

408
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,166
The next time one of your drones
bothers the Kents...

409
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:40,038
...he'll be lucky to catch a ride
home with the spare.

410
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,180
Lex.

411
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,583
Well done.

412
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,127
<i>Now playing quarterback</i>
<i>for your Metropolis Sharks...</i>

413
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:10,205
<i>...number 12, Whitney Fordman!</i>

414
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,168
Down, set, hut!

415
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:17,078
Hut, hut, hut!

416
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,153
Yes!

417
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:34,698
-You all right, Dad?
-Never better.

418
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:49,403
That's a really nice thing
you've done for the Fordmans.

419
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:55,315
Thanks, Mr. Kent.
That means a lot coming from you.

420
00:40:56,587 --> 00:41:01,581
I just want you to know, I closed
the book on that day at the bridge.

421
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,319
Why'd you investigate it
in the first place?

422
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,356
That day was a miracle.

423
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:11,397
Haven't you ever wanted to find out
why things like that happen?

424
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,133
No.

425
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,698
I just accept the fact that they do.

426
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:23,570
You don't need an explanation
for everything, Lex.

427
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,711
How did he get the Metropolis Sharks
to do it?

428
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:35,825
When your father owns the team,
it's easier to pull some strings.

429
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,326
It's strange, all this time
I never thought Lex even liked Whitney.

430
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,965
And then he goes and arranges all this.

431
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:45,033
I think Lex feels
he's become part of our lives.

432
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,295
I'd like to believe that.

433
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,071
You asked him, didn't you?

434
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:58,080
Being friends with Lex Luthor can be
complicated, but it has advantages.

435
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,546
-What was that for?
-Just being you.

436
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,873
-Dad, I'm sorry. What I said, it--
-Clark...

437
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:36,348
...the fishing trips, they never
had anything to do with fishing.

438
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:40,384
It was just that I wanted
to spend some time with my son.

439
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:48,927
My dad and I, we saw each other
every day but we never really talked.

440
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,868
I just don't want history
to repeat itself.

441
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,698
That makes two of us.

442
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:11,519
Dad, I know how we can catch
more fish this year.

443
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,156
What, new lures?

444
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,916
X-ray vision.

445
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,362
