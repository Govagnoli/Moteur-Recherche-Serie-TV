1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,592
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,315
- What are you doing in Metropolis?
- Had to pick up tractor parts for my dad.

3
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,398
And I got your text message,
so I brought you some brain food.

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,676
I don't remember texting you.

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,074
Is that chow mein?

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,599
Yeah.

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,157
What were you working on?

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,030
Oh, just some astronomy homework,
you know.

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,233
Numbers, equations and things I don't
really understand yet, but I'm starting to.

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,479
Chow mein.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,154
Oh, this was...
This was at your door.

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,912
Oh, that's weird.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,399
Open it.

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,156
"Given your new major, I thought
you might find this interesting. Lex."

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,753
Lex is sending you gifts?

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,832
Are you okay?

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,592
Just a scratch.

18
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,238
It's a meteor rock.

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,470
But I haven't seen one
like this before.

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,797
I gotta go. My dad's probably
waiting for those parts.

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,279
Hi.

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,078
And bye.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,558
Has my deodorant gone south?

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,349
- Why is he in such a hurry to bail?
- I have no idea.

25
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,796
I guess clark's just not into geology.

26
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,711
What the hell's wrong with you?!

27
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,958
Hello?

28
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,588
<i>I know who you are.</i>

29
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,509
It's bad enough he owns
half the state of Kansas...

30
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,069
...now he wants to tell us
what to do with our lives.

31
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,869
Jonathan, I know Senator Jennings asked
you to run after he had to step down...

32
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,110
<i>...but</i> I'm not gonna let you
risk your health.

33
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,192
Sweetheart, I feel fine.
I really do. I'm fine.

34
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,237
The election is in January.

35
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,197
Putting together a campaign in time...

36
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,430
...who knows what that
could do to your heart.

37
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,195
What about the stress of watching Lex
Luthor get sworn in? That could kill me.

38
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,717
If you run, every reporter in Kansas
will be digging into our lives.

39
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,075
What if somebody finds out
about clark's secret?

40
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,117
I think someone already has.

41
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,594
Clark, what happened?

42
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,831
Someone ran me off the road
on my way back from Metropolis.

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,752
- Did you see who it was?
- No.

44
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,639
By the time I got back to the road,
they were already gone.

45
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,397
Then I got a phone call, and a weird
voice said, "I know who you are."

46
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,800
Look, Clark,
I think the best thing you can do...

47
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,032
...is just stick to your normal routine.
Don't do anything unusual.

48
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,795
If these people are trying to expose you,
they'll be watching everything you do.

49
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,757
Let's not give them
anything to gawk at.

50
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,750
Brutus and Caesar.

51
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,076
Jesus and Judas.

52
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,357
They all started out as best friends.

53
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,192
What happened?

54
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,153
Well, if history teaches us one thing...

55
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,515
<i>...it's</i> that even the most
powerful men...

56
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,037
...can be betrayed
by those they trust the most.

57
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,432
The reason betrayal is a predominant
theme throughout history is quite simple.

58
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,031
Duplicity is human nature.

59
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,518
These classes getting shorter,
or is it just me?

60
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,633
Clark.

61
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,636
Is everything okay?
You look a little stressed out.

62
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,710
Something really weird
just happened after class.

63
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,440
And yesterday, a truck
tried to run me off the road.

64
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,473
It wasn't black, was it?

65
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,636
- Yeah, how'd you know?
- The same one's been following me.

66
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,318
Do you have any idea why?

67
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,436
We've been fishing
some dangerous waters.

68
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,319
- Maybe the shark's finally getting testy.
- Lex.

69
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,677
Never thought he'd take it this far.
Sorry for pulling you into this.

70
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,994
- I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No, let's not jump the gun.

71
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,958
- We need to figure out if it's him first.
- How do we do that?

72
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,712
I jotted down the license plate
of the truck.

73
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,838
Do you know anyone who can find out
who it's registered to?

74
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,116
- My friend Chloe could dig it up.
- All right.

75
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,469
I'll check with campus security, see if
they've had reports about that truck.

76
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,755
- Thanks.
- Listen, Clark...

77
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,117
...whatever happens, we're in this
together. Remember that, okay?

78
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,997
How long do you think
this is gonna take?

79
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,549
We should get a fax
in just a couple of minutes.

80
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,792
What do you wanna bet
that truck's registered to Luthorcorp?

81
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,996
I don't know, clark.

82
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,913
Lex comes from more of
the Rube Goldberg school of villainy.

83
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,719
I think this sort of direct attack
isn't really his style.

84
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,356
- There's only one way to find out.
- I'll go check the fax machine.

85
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,079
Clark, we've got a problem.

86
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,152
According to the DMV, your mysterious
black truck doesn't exist.

87
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,958
You sure
the license plate numbers...?

88
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,554
Why are you getting messages
from Lionel Luthor?

89
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,629
- You read my e-mails?
- Just answer the question.

90
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,315
My job at the <i>Daily Planet</i> requires me
to talk to a lot of different people.

91
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,995
- Even moral pygmies like Lionel Luthor.
- What'd you tell him about me?

92
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,799
What are you talking about?
I didn't tell him anything.

93
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,873
Three people in Smallville know
about my secret. My mom, my dad...

94
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,439
...and you.

95
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,672
You think I told Lionel your secret?
Clark, I would never, ever do that.

96
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,191
I can't believe I trusted you.

97
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,952
Clark, I didn't say anything.

98
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,279
I'm paying you for results, Griff,
not excuses. Get it done.

99
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,956
I'll have to call you back.

100
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,636
Is this a bad time?

101
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,275
For you? Never.

102
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,593
I wanted to thank you
for that rock that you sent me.

103
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,832
It's an amazing find.
I'd love to know more about it.

104
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,270
What rock would that be?

105
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,431
The silver meteor rock.

106
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,279
That sounds very intriguing...

107
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,954
<i>...but</i> I've never seen
a silver meteor rock before.

108
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,872
It wasn't from me, Lana.

109
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,308
It came with a note from you, Lex.

110
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,156
Someone's obviously
playing a game with you.

111
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,753
I don't know anything about it.

112
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,388
Just like you don't know anything about
the spaceship in the last meteor shower?

113
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,755
- That's different.
- Why?

114
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,400
Why is it different, Lex?

115
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,837
Because there are some doors that
can't be closed once they're opened.

116
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,879
Thanks.

117
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,312
Did you get that
from a fortune cookie?

118
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,630
What I'm trying to <i>say...</i>

119
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,232
...everything I've <i>done...</i>

120
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,755
- ...it's all been to protect you.
- I don't need to be protected, Lex.

121
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,276
I need the truth.

122
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,068
Then I have something to show you.

123
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,318
It's real.

124
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,512
Yes, it is.

125
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,716
And I want you to help me
get inside...

126
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,917
...and understand
exactly what we're dealing with.

127
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,472
The hardworking,
all-American farmer.

128
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,074
I can already see
the campaign poster.

129
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,994
No TV spot, unfortunately,
considering your state of your finances.

130
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,116
Look, I don't know how you <i>knew...</i>

131
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,669
...that I was considering running
for state senate...

132
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,149
...but if you came to strong-arm me
into quitting...

133
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,550
On the contrary.
I am here to offer my support.

134
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,439
You'll need considerable amounts
of money and influence...

135
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,113
...to win this election.

136
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,035
You have a more than, shall we say,
privileged adversary.

137
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,272
So you wanna back me for Senate
running against your son?

138
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,396
Why would you wanna do that?

139
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,434
Lex is an extraordinary young man.

140
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,513
He's always had
an extraordinary appetite for power.

141
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,914
But if he succeeds in this first foray
into the political arena...

142
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,674
<i>...I'm</i> afraid he'll develop
such a fierce taste for it...

143
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,432
...he'll go on to devour the world.

144
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,991
I guess the apple
doesn't fall that far from the tree.

145
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,470
I know you don't trust me, Jonathan.
You have no reason to.

146
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,791
But I'm asking you to accept
my offer of support.

147
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,796
I know about Clark.

148
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,635
Chloe Sullivan has supplied me
with all the information I need.

149
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,595
His true identity, the powers
he possesses and uses.

150
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,672
I know he's vulnerable to kryptonite.

151
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,917
Accept my support and I can
guarantee you a seat in the Senate.

152
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,916
And what happens if I don't accept?

153
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,310
The truth about Clark
will come out in any case.

154
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,552
The only difference is how
he'll be treated when we run the tests.

155
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:14,157
He can either be a distinguished guest,
or strapped down, helpless, like a lab rat.

156
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,632
It's your choice.

157
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,230
It's so smooth.

158
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,960
It almost feels like liquid.

159
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,190
Frictionless surface.

160
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,113
At least, that's what
my experts tell me.

161
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,999
You've been studying it
this whole time.

162
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,836
And you let me think what I saw the day
of the meteor shower wasn't <i>real...</i>

163
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,479
...that I was losing my mind.

164
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,950
I didn't want you to question
your sanity. I was trying to protect you.

165
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,157
You keep saying that. What do you think
you're protecting me from?

166
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,758
This ship...

167
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,472
...is one of the most important
discoveries in the history of mankind.

168
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,677
There are people
who have killed for a lot less.

169
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,271
Now, if I had told you the truth
and something happened to you...

170
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,351
<i>...I'd</i> never forgive myself.

171
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,352
So, what changed?

172
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,994
I couldn't lie to you anymore.

173
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,714
Is that the real reason?

174
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,160
Or is it because you
and your scientists are stumped?

175
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,750
Because I'm the only person on Earth
who's seen this thing open up?

176
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,791
This is a chance
to finally get answers...

177
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,077
...to questions that have been
haunting you since your parents died.

178
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,510
The meteors that killed them,
this ship...

179
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,798
...all the strange things that happen
in Smallville, it's all tied together.

180
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,070
I'm offering you
the opportunity of a lifetime.

181
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,673
Whether or not you take it
is up to you.

182
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,792
Hi, Clark.

183
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,919
Your dad was looking for you.

184
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,150
I just saw him in the barn
with Lionel Luthor.

185
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,799
Lionel?

186
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,197
There he is. Clark, come on out
and give me a hand with the tractor.

187
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,158
- Where is it?
- Oh, it's by the barn. I think we need...

188
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,833
- Where is it?
- Whoa, hey!

189
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,228
- Clark!
- What are you doing?

190
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,118
See, he got this
from Lionel Luthor.

191
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,635
- He's helping him put me in the lab.
- What?

192
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,317
Clark, Lionel stopped by
to talk about the campaign.

193
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,554
Sure, he brought me Lex's balance sheet
so I could see what I was up against.

194
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,790
- What about the money?
- What money?

195
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,949
This money!

196
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,596
Why are you doing this to me, Dad?

197
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,639
- Why are you doing it?
- Hey!

198
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,995
Clark, stop it!

199
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,914
Martha!

200
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,949
No more lies.

201
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,351
Tell me the truth.

202
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,239
- Tell me!
- You want the truth?

203
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,752
You were never really my son.

204
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,836
You were the thing
I found in the cornfield.

205
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,633
Clark, please, I don't wanna do this.
Just calm down.

206
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,633
You're all in this together.

207
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,398
- Clark.
- I knew it.

208
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,673
Mrs. Kent, are you all right?

209
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,913
Chloe, how long
have you known about Clark?

210
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,713
Since last year.

211
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,190
Yeah, what...?

212
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,079
How much did he tell you, Chloe?

213
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,716
Well, everything, I think.

214
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,270
I mean, that's how I knew about
the kryptonite he kept hidden in the barn.

215
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,352
I just came by to check in on him,
and I heard this commotion...

216
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,676
What's happening?
Why is he acting this way?

217
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,469
I don't know. He came to visit me at
the <i>Daily Planet,</i> and he just freaked out.

218
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,677
He was just accusing me of revealing
his secrets to Lionel Luthor.

219
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,115
I tried to explain to him,
and he wouldn't listen.

220
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,670
- It was like he was a different person.
- It must be Red Kryptonite.

221
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,513
No, sweetheart, it's different somehow.
I don't think so.

222
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,960
- Red Kryptonite?
- There's another kind of kryptonite.

223
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,159
It's red instead of green.
It changes clark's personality.

224
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,472
He loses all his inhibitions
and becomes very unpredictable.

225
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,030
What about Silver Kryptonite?

226
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,752
Silver?

227
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,392
I think I may know
what's gotten into clark.

228
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,157
- Lana.
- Clark, what are you doing here?

229
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,392
Waiting for you.
Get your stuff together, we gotta go.

230
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,994
- Go where?
- Up north. I know a place.

231
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,799
- They'll never find us.
- Wait, slow down. What's going on?

232
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,791
- They turned against me, Lana.
- Who did?

233
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,916
Chloe, my parents.

234
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,958
You're the only one I can trust now.
You're the only one.

235
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,430
- Whatever they did, it can't be that bad.
- No, Lana, you <i>don't...</i>

236
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,837
She's coming. She's coming.

237
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,638
Chloe's coming. All right, listen.

238
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,439
I promise I'll come back to you,
all right? I'll find you.

239
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,673
- Don't listen to a word they say.
- Clark, I'm just gonna call your parents.

240
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,233
Lana, thank God.
Has Clark been here?

241
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,755
- Why?
- Because I need to talk to him.

242
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,559
Did he ever touch
that silver rock you had?

243
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,711
He's been here, hasn't he?

244
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,793
He told me not to trust you.

245
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,394
Okay, clark's gone
all Captain Paranoid...

246
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,757
...and I think it might be
because of that silver meteor you have.

247
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,957
- He did prick his finger with it.
- Lana, clark's been infected.

248
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,997
He thinks everyone's
turned against him.

249
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,789
If we don't help him, he'll end up hurting
someone. Do you know where he went?

250
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,072
He was here for a second, then he was
gone. The way he was acting...

251
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,556
It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna call the Kents.

252
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,359
They're looking in Smallville.
I'll see if I can find him.

253
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,636
- I'm gonna come with you.
- No, Lana, don't.

254
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,793
You stay here, and if he shows up
just call me and try and keep him calm.

255
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,793
I think you're the only one
he'll listen to right now.

256
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,993
Clark, I was wondering
if you'd forgotten about me.

257
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,479
- Is everything all right?
- No.

258
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,517
Chloe's in on it too.
So are my parents.

259
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,954
In on what?

260
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,476
The truck following us, did you get
any information from campus security?

261
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,598
- Campus security?
- You said you were gonna talk to them.

262
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,752
Clark, I haven't seen you
in over a week.

263
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,275
No, no. We spoke this morning.

264
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,671
After class we talked about the truck.
You were gonna talk to security.

265
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,910
I had a class but you weren't in it.

266
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,753
Yes, I was... No, I was... Yes.
No, we talked. I know...

267
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,638
Look, Clark...

268
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,516
Look, I got a faculty meeting
right now...

269
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,830
<i>...but</i> why don't you wait
for me in my office.

270
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,831
I'll make an excuse,
I'll be right back.

271
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,834
Clark, whatever's happening,
we're in this together.

272
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,398
Who's there?

273
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,714
What is this?

274
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,158
<i>The investigation into Clark Kent</i>
<i>has yielded a surprising revelation.</i>

275
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,675
<i>Clark Kent is not of this Earth.</i>

276
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,196
<i>He is an alien,</i>
<i>an intruder from a distant galaxy.</i>

277
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,316
<i>The first vanguard of an invasion.</i>

278
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,836
No. No, it's not what I am!

279
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,319
<i>But I know his weakness.</i>

280
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,677
<i>I know how to stop this strange visitor</i>
<i>from another planet.</i>

281
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,551
I'm the one
that's gonna kill you, clark.

282
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,953
I should have known
you'd pull something like this.

283
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,157
You can't stand
to see us together, can you?

284
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,356
This is the part where I usually say,
"Lana, what are you talking about?"

285
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,717
I don't know how, but you knew what
would happen when you sent this.

286
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,115
I swear this is the first time
I've ever seen a meteor rock like this.

287
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,071
I don't have time
for any more of your lies, Lex.

288
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,358
What did that do to Clark?

289
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,550
I just shared the most important secret
in the world with you today.

290
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,836
What would I have to gain
by lying to you now?

291
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,873
If you didn't send this to me,
then who did?

292
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,871
I honestly don't know.

293
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,991
Now, you said this did something
to Clark. What happened?

294
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,071
Chloe thinks it infected him.

295
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,159
He's acting all paranoid,
like everyone's turning against him.

296
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,313
- The way he looked when I saw him...
- Listen to me.

297
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,950
We'll take this to Luthorcorp and get
my best people working on a cure.

298
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,156
Whatever's happening to clark,
I promise I'll find a way to help him.

299
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,314
Thank you.

300
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,591
You're my partner now.

301
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,557
It's the least I can do.

302
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,717
I'm sorry that I didn't trust you, Lex.

303
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,118
I know we've had our differences,
but you have always been there for me.

304
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,071
And I always will be.

305
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,275
Call in as many people as you need.
I want an update every 30 minutes.

306
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,829
My security is coordinating
with Chloe and the Kents.

307
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,228
They're not gonna hurt him?

308
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,834
If that happens,
somebody's transferred to Siberia.

309
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,831
Let's get this sample
over to LuthorCorp.

310
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,231
The sooner we have it analyzed,
the faster we'll be able to help clark.

311
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,272
Stay here.

312
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,317
I'll see what's going on.

313
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,190
- A lot of people are looking for you.
- I know they are.

314
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,079
I want you to listen to me
very carefully.

315
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,919
Something's happened to you.

316
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,837
Yeah. It's been a revelation.

317
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,594
Clark, you're very sick.
We need to get you to the lab.

318
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,034
We should get to the lab.

319
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,397
We should get to the lab
so you can experiment on me.

320
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,468
You know, Lex,
it all makes sense now.

321
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,913
See, I thought
you were obsessed with me.

322
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,357
But it's not about me at all, is it?
It's about Lana.

323
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,639
- It's always been Lana.
- Clark.

324
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,711
And all these things
that you do to me...

325
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,155
...all the digging, all the tests,
all the lies...

326
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,233
...it was just to get me out of the way
so you could have her all to yourself.

327
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,789
Listen to what you're saying, clark.
This isn't you.

328
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,359
I don't know what you did.

329
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,351
I'm not sure what you did
to trick her...

330
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,353
...into believing that she was
in love with you. I don't know.

331
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,990
- I'm not gonna let you get away with it.
- I need you to stop.

332
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,394
I don't wanna hurt you.

333
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,596
But I wanna hurt you.

334
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,710
Lana!

335
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,714
Lana!

336
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,152
Lana, I know you're down here.

337
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,236
Come on, I wanna...
I wanna talk.

338
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,637
Lana!

339
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,114
We were meant to be together.

340
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,676
It's okay, Lana, I'm here.

341
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,673
Whatever Lex was doing to you,
I stopped it.

342
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,794
Oh, God. What did you do?
Did you hurt him?

343
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,508
Why do you care
about him so much?

344
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,713
Whatever you think Lex did,
it's all part of some delusion.

345
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,316
- I saw you kiss him.
- No, I would never do that.

346
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,754
Stop lying.

347
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,753
Stop lying.

348
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,036
I loved you, Lana.

349
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,875
More than anything else, I loved you,
and you betrayed me like everyone else.

350
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,554
Clark!

351
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,079
You don't wanna do that.

352
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,194
Trust me.

353
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,796
I can't trust anyone anymore.

354
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,272
- You one of Lex's experiments?
- No, I'm your friend.

355
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,637
If you hurt Lana, it'll destroy you.

356
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,559
- What the hell are you?
- I'm a Kryptonian, just like you.

357
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,950
And I'm <i>sorry...</i>

358
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,876
...but this is really gonna hurt.

359
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,756
You'll be all right now, Kal-EI.

360
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,389
Lana?

361
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,559
Lana.

362
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,831
Clark.

363
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,237
What have you done?

364
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,831
Really?

365
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,394
Hi.

366
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,714
You know, the caffeine in my system
is getting to a dangerously normal level.

367
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,713
I'm gonna go get a cup.

368
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,356
- Lana, l...
- Clark.

369
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,556
It's okay.

370
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,119
Chloe told me everything.

371
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,995
- She did?
- Yeah.

372
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,631
How that silver meteor infected you.

373
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,314
How it made you think
that everyone was out to get you.

374
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,957
Even that it gave you
some sort of temporary powers.

375
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,992
Lana, you know I would never
do anything to hurt you.

376
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,678
Of course I know that.

377
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,277
Clark, whatever you think you saw...

378
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,954
...was just the meteor
playing tricks with your mind.

379
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,951
It wasn't real.

380
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,349
There could never, ever be anything
between me and Lex.

381
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,478
I was imagining
some pretty crazy stuff.

382
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,635
Chloe turning against me.

383
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,519
My dad making a deal with Lionel.

384
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,759
You and Lex
talking about a spaceship.

385
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,713
Yeah.

386
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,758
I'm just glad you're all right, clark.

387
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,916
Thanks for covering for me.

388
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,957
Of course, Clark.

389
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,870
You know, I have to admit,
for once in my life...

390
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,999
...I was actually glad
I wasn't the object of your desire.

391
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,517
You know, you're just lucky
you snapped out of it when you did.

392
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,313
- Lf I'd have killed Lana...
- But you didn't.

393
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,155
So stop beating yourself up about it.
I mean, Silver Kryptonite, who knew?

394
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,072
I just don't want it to happen again.

395
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,516
- Did you get that rock?
- No.

396
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,309
I went to see Lex, and he said it just
disappeared during the excitement.

397
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,995
Not that he ever even admitted he sent
the rock to Lana in the first place.

398
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,674
I still don't trust him.
It's not about being paranoid.

399
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,910
Yeah, well, he is a Luthor.

400
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,275
You know, speaking
of the evil dynasty...

401
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,319
...I need to come clean
about something.

402
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,999
Those e-mails that you saw
on my computer from Lionel...

403
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,518
...well, you weren't imagining them.

404
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,389
- So you are talking to Lionel?
- Yeah, but not about you, about Lex.

405
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,996
Lionel's been feeding me information
about Lex's campaign for state senate.

406
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,639
Why would he do that?

407
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,314
Maybe because he knows his son
better than any of us...

408
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,597
...and the thought of what Lex would do
in office scares him.

409
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,751
He's not the only one.

410
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,676
Look, Clark, I understand
that you haven't been <i>yourself...</i>

411
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,150
...but you know that I would never
tell Lionel your secret.

412
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,069
I'd never tell anyone.

413
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,833
I'd die before I'd ever betray you.

414
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,354
Those Kents, they pack quite a punch,
don't they, son?

415
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,229
Might be wise to avoid any more
press conferences...

416
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,756
...until your face has healed a bit.
- I wasn't planning to.

417
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,916
Not that it's any of your business.

418
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,116
Fatherly advice, I can't help it.

419
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,034
But a front-page story that you were
soundly beaten by a jealous young lover...

420
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,997
...will hardly aid your bid for office.

421
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,673
I have a team
of political advisers, Dad.

422
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,638
Last time I checked,
you weren't on the payroll.

423
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,109
Last time I checked,
Lana Lang had a boyfriend...

424
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,840
<i>...and</i> I don't think
she's in the market for a spare.

425
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,434
I think you know the way out.

426
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,909
This isn't about serving the greater good,
or even about power.

427
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,198
It's about you changing the way
people perceive you, isn't it?

428
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,671
That's why you're running for office.

429
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,115
Even if you were president
of the United States...

430
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,918
<i>...you</i> think it'd make a difference?

431
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,150
Because the people
who are close to you...

432
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,550
...will always know
what is truly in your heart.

433
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,509
That's why Lana Lang
will never love you, son.

434
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,309
I don't know exactly
what was real and what wasn't.

435
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,472
Your parents loaning you to Lionel Luthor
for medical research...

436
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,471
...definitely not real.

437
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,836
Well, I know you'd never do that.

438
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,560
- I'm sorry.
- It wasn't your fault, sweetheart.

439
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,359
I'm just glad the infection
burned itself out when it did.

440
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,718
Yeah, me too.

441
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,598
No matter how much
I trust someone...

442
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,149
<i>...I'm</i> always gonna worry about
my secret coming out.

443
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,434
That's what I never wanted
to have happen.

444
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,792
Which is why...

445
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,710
<i>...I've</i> decided not to run against Lex.

446
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,678
Dad, I don't want you to put
your life on hold because of me.

447
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,149
- Clark...
- I'm not gonna let fear control my life.

448
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,311
Or ruin yours.

449
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,559
I want you to run against Lex.
It's the right thing to do.

450
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,878
If anything happens...

451
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,396
...we'll deal with it the same way
we always have, as a family.

452
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,277
Professor Fine?

453
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,830
How are you feeling, Kal-EI?

454
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,992
So I didn't imagine that part.

455
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,518
No, you didn't.

456
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,908
I thought I was the last
son of Krypton...

457
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,752
...but you people keep popping up.

458
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,471
Well, a superior civilization
is difficult to eradicate.

459
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,758
- Why are you here?
- To stop what's coming.

460
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,674
And to help you walk the path
of a true Kryptonian.

461
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,357
So I can be superior? No, thanks.

462
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,599
Why do you continue to trust humans
more than your own people?

463
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,236
Just going off what I've seen.

464
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,709
Maybe you need to look closer.

465
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,995
Why didn't you just tell me
who you really were...

466
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,357
...instead of posing
as my professor this whole time?

467
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,798
Why do you keep your identity a secret,
even from the woman you love?

468
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,717
You've been on this planet
many years, Kal-EI.

469
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,996
I had to observe you
before revealing myself...

470
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,756
<i>...to</i> determine just how much you've
been influenced by these humans.

471
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,910
You say "human"
like it's a bad thing.

472
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,158
Just going on what I've seen.

473
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,600
This race shows promise...

474
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,318
<i>...but</i> at this point in history, they're still
duplicitous by their very nature.

475
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,948
Even the ones you think you love
can't be trusted.

476
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,034
You don't know
anything about this race.

477
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,476
Yeah, they can be petty and dishonest
and betray each other over nothing...

478
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,236
...but they can also be
honest and loyal...

479
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,517
...and they would give up everything
to protect someone they love...

480
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,710
...even if they were
from another planet.

481
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,439
Kal-EI...

482
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,356
My name is Clark.

483
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,832
And I'll always believe
in my friends and my family.

484
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,309
I sincerely hope your trust
hasn't been misplaced.

485
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,716
You know where to find me...

486
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,519
<i>...when</i> you're ready
to accept the truth.
