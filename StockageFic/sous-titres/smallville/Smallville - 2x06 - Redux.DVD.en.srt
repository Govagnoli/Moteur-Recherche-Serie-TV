1
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:26,054
Okay, take five. Kent and Turner,
you're in the final.

2
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:30,026
Dude, I'd definitely take
you in a rematch.

3
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,165
My foot slipped on the dive,
ruined my rhythm.

4
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,699
It's funny, I thought you
were just slow.

5
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,933
He's a hottie, isn't he?

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,005
Look at him.

7
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,867
- Who, Clark?
- Oh, come on, Lana.

8
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,446
- Krissy, Clark and I are just friends.
- Right.

9
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,745
- So, what do you think?
- Awesome.

10
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:58,118
I'll ask the principal
if we can hang it in the cafeteria.

11
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,556
You've really thrown yourself
into Spirit Week. I'm impressed.

12
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,858
Well, these are the best times of our lives.
Isn't that what they say?

13
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,063
To be honest, I'd forgotten
how much fun this can be.

14
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,136
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Krissy. Hey, baby.

15
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:16,134
Hey, Troy, you're dripping
on my signs.

16
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:20,473
- Don't you have another race?
- Finals. I need a good-luck kiss.

17
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:25,576
- Go. I can finish up here.
- Thanks. Follow me.

18
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,750
Not a problem.

19
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,730
All right, this one's for bragging rights.
Fastest in the school.

20
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,299
Okay, guys, on the blocks.

21
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,628
Come on, Troy, hurry up.

22
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,209
Swimmers, take your marks.

23
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,107
Three, two, one!

24
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,793
Troy?

25
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,427
- Hey, hey! Troy!
- What's wrong with him?

26
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,268
He's going under!

27
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,004
Somebody help him!

28
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,437
- Troy!
- Help him!

29
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,592
Open your mouth.

30
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,825
Hey, that's perfect.

31
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,661
All we have to do is come up with
a snappy name, we'll make a fortune.

32
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,235
Forget Mrs. Fields.
You could be "Mrs. Kents."

33
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:02,636
- I like the sound of that.
- This is turning into a bigtime operation.

34
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,073
Thanks. I've added
two convenience stores...

35
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,873
...and the retirement center
to my client list.

36
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,810
That's great.

37
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,846
What?

38
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,851
I don't see how we'll pay
the feed bill this month.

39
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:19,815
- I could get an extension on our credit.
- We're already three months behind.

40
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:23,360
- Henry's a friend, he'll understand.
- He already said no.

41
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,657
My salary from Lionel isn't enough.
What are we gonna do?

42
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,166
I don't know, we don't have
a whole lot of options here.

43
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,065
There is one call we can make.

44
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,176
Maybe we should talk to my father.

45
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,115
Why is it whenever anyone
mentions Granddad...

46
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,277
...everyone becomes quiet
and uncomfortable?

47
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,480
- Isn't it weird I've never met the guy?
- Clark, I'm...

48
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:55,788
I'm sorry that you haven't had a relationship
with your grandpa, I really am.

49
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,157
But there's too much bad blood.

50
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,999
I'm sorry, but I've got work to do.

51
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:16,314
- Lana, where would you like these?
- You can just put them on the counter.

52
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,178
- Getting ready for the Spirit Week bash?
- Trying to.

53
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:24,380
I think Nell's used the projection booth
as her personal storage since the late '70s.

54
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,656
What are those?

55
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,927
Clark, these photos are
of my mom and some guy.

56
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,570
Maybe he's an old boyfriend.

57
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,909
They were taken when
my parents were married.

58
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,172
Maybe he was just a friend.

59
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,848
- I'm sure you're right.
- Right about what?

60
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,183
The mystery man with Lana's mother.

61
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,259
Hey, they make an attractive couple.

62
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:08,861
And there could be a million explanations.
Who do you think it is?

63
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,028
I don't know,
but I'll bet Nell does.

64
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:16,073
Then mystery solved.
I wish they were all this easy.

65
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,836
Well, it's late, we should
get to school.

66
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:23,141
- I'm heading that way, if you need a lift.
- I've got the first two periods off.

67
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,979
- Clark?
- No, I was just gonna run.

68
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,718
I don't think you could outrun
my Porsche, Clark.

69
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,195
Excuse me. What's going on?
I need to get in there.

70
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:47,237
- You should've been here earlier, Mr...?
- Kent. Clark Kent.

71
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,571
Of course. I noticed in your records
you have a penchant for tardiness.

72
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,541
- Who exactly are you?
- I'm Mr. Reynolds, your new principal.

73
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,848
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Yes.

74
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,576
So you're aware,
from now on...

75
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:05,190
...this gate locks when the bell rings
and doesn't open until school is out.

76
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,848
I'd...

77
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:11,520
I'd appreciate it if you'd give Clark
a pass. He was late because of me.

78
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,289
Lex Luthor.

79
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:17,869
The Porsche, the attitude. Somehow
I'm not surprised you're involved.

80
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,801
- You know each other.
- Mr. Reynolds was headmaster...

81
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,373
...at Excelsior Prep
during my stay there.

82
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,773
You might find this hard
to believe, Lex...

83
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,403
...but people should take responsibility
for their own actions.

84
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,779
- It won't happen again.
- I'm keeping my eye on you, Mr. Kent.

85
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,948
The next time it happens,
automatic detention.

86
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,287
Catch you later, Clark.

87
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:50,368
Spare the rod, spoil the child. You haven't
changed. What's next, school uniforms?

88
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,868
I'd appreciate it if you'd stay away
from my school and my students, Luthor.

89
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:59,307
Listen, I know we had our share
of run-ins at Excelsior, but I was 14.

90
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,243
Don't you think it's petty to be
holding a grudge?

91
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,111
That's awfully noble,
coming from a Luthor.

92
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,676
I'm a little confused.

93
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,448
Exactly what did I do
to earn such enmity?

94
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,857
Goodbye, Lex.

95
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,865
Kristine Parker?

96
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,243
- I'm Principal Reynolds.
- Hi, nice to finally meet you.

97
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:41,614
- Did you get my memo about the uniforms?
- I did. Thank you, I'm looking into it.

98
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:45,348
I understand you're the visionary
behind our Spirit Week activities.

99
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,323
Well, I just want everyone
to have the best time ever.

100
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,553
I admire your enthusiasm.

101
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,860
I was going through the student files,
trying to get to know everyone better...

102
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:59,095
...and I noticed we don't have
the transcripts from your last school.

103
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:03,299
That's weird. But it figures,
my guidance counselor was a total ditz.

104
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:07,139
We need a copy on file. If you can
have your parents forward it...

105
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:11,147
...I'd appreciate it.
- No problem, I'll tell them tonight.

106
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,061
I see Troy's death has joined the ranks
of the unexplained and bizarre.

107
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,862
Big time. The report said he died of an
onset of a rapid aging disease, progeria. Hi.

108
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,062
I thought that made you age
over 10 years, not 10 seconds.

109
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,903
Exactly. The coroner's running a test
to tell whether Troy had progeria, or...

110
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,942
Something unexplained and bizarre.

111
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:45,140
Good luck investigating. You'll probably
need a hall pass from our new principal.

112
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,786
A lot of schools have
a closed-campus policy.

113
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,316
- Why you so worked up?
- I had a run-in with him.

114
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,721
He busted me for being late.
Threatened to keep his eye on me.

115
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:58,557
Clark's on the principal's bad boy list.
First time for everything.

116
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,426
- Guy's a real hard case.
- Right.

117
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,161
First, it's a lock-down, next thing you know
he'll be burning books.

118
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,396
Wait till he comes after The Torch.

119
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:11,635
I did some digging on our Principal Reynolds
to find out his views on the fourth estate.

120
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,735
Harvard, B.A.
Ph.D. At Columbia in education.

121
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:19,877
Taught at prep schools all over Europe and
the East Coast. Pretty impressive resume.

122
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:24,079
His name was mentioned as the new head
of the Metropolis Board of Education.

123
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,350
Till one day he's dismissed
from Excelsior Prep...

124
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,585
...and he doesn't work
again until here.

125
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,560
How does a guy on the fast track
end up in Smallville?

126
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,292
I don't know, but he's not
Wall of Weird material.

127
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:40,138
Just because the guy doesn't love you
like every other teacher in this school...

128
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,639
...doesn't mean that he's hiding
some dark past.

129
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,447
Hey. Came by to see if
you needed a hand.

130
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,144
Thought you were helping
your mom this afternoon.

131
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,849
- She said she's got it covered.
- Something wrong?

132
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,392
My mom's been secretive
the last couple days.

133
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:05,052
A Kent secretive, that's shocking.

134
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,564
- It has to do with my grandfather.
- You've never mentioned him.

135
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,931
I've never actually met him.
I've only seen old pictures.

136
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:16,040
- Do you know anything about him?
- He was a corporate lawyer in Metropolis.

137
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,302
He and my grandmother
retired to Coast City.

138
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,307
When I was in sixth grade,
I decided to call him. I left messages...

139
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:26,815
...but he never called back.
Guess he wasn't interested.

140
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:30,547
All these years I had this image
of the Kents as the perfect family.

141
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,817
I guess we're just as dysfunctional
as everyone else.

142
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,185
I never did pressure my parents
for the story.

143
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,092
Maybe you didn't want to know.

144
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,524
Maybe it's easier to live
with the image than the truth.

145
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,798
Looks like we're both dealing
with secrets out of the past.

146
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:51,369
I'm not sure what I'm gonna do, but this
is your chance to get some answers.

147
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,849
I'll catch up with you later?

148
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:07,320
Lana, the place looks fantastic.

149
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,955
- You've done a really good job here.
- Thanks.

150
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:16,290
- I wanted to talk to you about something.
- Yeah, what is it?

151
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,901
These pictures.

152
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,575
Do you know who he is?

153
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,812
Must have been one of your mom's
old boyfriends.

154
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,973
They were taken after Mom and Dad
were already married.

155
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,847
Just a year before I was born.

156
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,922
Lana, what's this about?

157
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,187
I'm not sure.

158
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,057
Listen to me.

159
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,788
Your mother...

160
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:51,896
She loved you and your father more
than anything else in this world.

161
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:56,674
She never would have done anything
to hurt either of you.

162
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,144
You know that, don't you?

163
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,098
Hi, Dad.

164
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,400
I appreciate you making the trip.

165
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,513
I was surprised to get
your message.

166
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:40,481
Must have taken a lot for Jonathan
to ask for my help.

167
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,953
Jonathan is at the co-op in Granville.
He doesn't know I called.

168
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,722
I should have known.

169
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,589
I imagined this place differently.

170
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,467
But it's not the life I wanted
for you, Martha.

171
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,661
I'm happy, Dad. It's a good life.

172
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,969
For some people, maybe.
But you had so much potential.

173
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:09,103
Top 10 in your class. You could have gone
to any law school you wanted.

174
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,374
I had hoped you'd take over
my practice.

175
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,951
I never wanted to be a lawyer.
This is the life I chose.

176
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,588
This is the life Jonathan
chose for you.

177
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:21,157
- You just went along for the ride.
- This isn't about Jonathan.

178
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:25,161
You raised an independent daughter.
You're angry because you got that.

179
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:30,325
Here you are, 20 years later, going behind
your husband's back asking me for money.

180
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,437
- Mom?
- Clark.

181
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,806
I thought you were at the Talon.

182
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,868
I finished early. What's up?

183
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,708
Clark, this is your grandfather.

184
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:50,115
- Pleased to meet you, sir.
- Hello, Clark.

185
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,494
I'II...

186
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,494
I'll be at the motel.

187
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:03,731
I'll have a cashier's check drawn
tomorrow morning.

188
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,703
Why don't you stay with us?
We have plenty of room.

189
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,467
I don't think that would be
a very good idea, Clark.

190
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,144
Well, how about dinner?

191
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,174
One meal as a family.

192
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,376
I'm sorry.

193
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:46,009
I don't want your father having anything
to do with our finances.

194
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,112
Jonathan, what was I supposed to do?

195
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,182
- Wait until the bank foreclosed?
- I wish you'd said something to me first.

196
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:56,117
- What's the harm in hearing him out?
- You don't have to be the mediator.

197
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,348
- I wish things could be different.
- Why can't they be?

198
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:04,053
You told me to look for the best in people.
Maybe he's trying to put this behind him.

199
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,527
I seriously doubt that, Clark.

200
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,361
What happened that was
so bad?

201
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,766
It can't be any worse than
what's in the storm cellar.

202
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,304
Or can it?

203
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:22,974
When your mother and I decided to get
married, I went to him to ask for her hand.

204
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,477
- What'd he say?
- I remember his exact words:

205
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:30,678
"I will not let my daughter throw her life
away by marrying a hick farmer...

206
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,518
...that couldn't possibly
support her."

207
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:37,387
- Well, that's harsh.
- That's the way he dealt with people.

208
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:42,032
When he realized we were serious
about getting married, he lost it.

209
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,261
- He tried to shove me out of his office.
- What happened?

210
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,302
I hit him.

211
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,975
I'm not proud of that,
I tried to apologize to him.

212
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,709
He wouldn't have anything to do
with it. Your grandfather and I...

213
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:03,514
...haven't said a word to each other since.
- That was 20 years ago.

214
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,090
He was willing to drive out here,
maybe he wants to try again.

215
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:11,457
Believe me, Clark, he's not here to help.
He's here to gloat.

216
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:38,885
Hey, I got a message you wanted
to see me. Everything all right?

217
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,288
I was wondering if you could
do me a favor.

218
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,825
I take it Nell couldn't identify
the mystery man?

219
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,529
If she could, she wouldn't
tell me anything.

220
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,291
I wanna know who it is.

221
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,232
Well, that shouldn't be
hard to find.

222
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:56,033
But coming to terms with it could prove
to be more complicated.

223
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,675
What do you mean?

224
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,970
Come on, you know the story
of Pandora.

225
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:03,239
She was given a box by Zeus
and warned never to open it.

226
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,816
- She couldn't resist the temptation.
- I'm not afraid of the truth.

227
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:10,887
Neither was Pandora. But once the box
was open, it could never be closed.

228
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,616
All the misery could
never be put back.

229
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:17,751
I appreciate the warning.
And anything you can tell me.

230
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,158
Go, Crows!

231
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,601
- Hey, Chloe.
- Hey, Clark.

232
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,832
Clark, you might want to disappear
for the next hour or so.

233
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,999
- Why's that?
- I'm about to interview...

234
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,737
...your new best friend,
Principal Reynolds.

235
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,279
Thanks for the heads up.

236
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,786
- What have you got there?
- Remember my buddy...

237
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:47,085
...that works at the M.E.'s office?
- The guy with the black fingernail polish.

238
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:51,628
It's hard being Smallville's only goth.
He sent me the autopsy report of Troy.

239
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,289
It's amazing what lending someone
your eyeliner can get you.

240
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,427
So Troy didn't have progeria.

241
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:04,235
No, but his pituitary gland, which produces
a hormone that controls the aging process...

242
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:08,573
...was completely drained. Like someone
just sucked the youth out of him.

243
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,443
Well, that's quite an assumption,
Miss Sullivan.

244
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:14,845
Principal Reynolds.

245
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,013
I was just running through
various scenarios, you know...

246
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:22,388
...wild theories and stuff.
I'm shutting up now.

247
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:26,095
Well, don't. I like my students
thinking outside the box.

248
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,830
I've been reading back issues
of The Torch.

249
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,868
I see a lot of creativity
and insight there.

250
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:35,564
- You're kidding.
- Well, unverified insight.

251
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:40,269
But many a Pulitzer has sprung
from the seeds of wild theories.

252
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,746
Just make sure you can back
them up.

253
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,978
That'll be the difference between
writing trash for The Inquisitor...

254
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:52,123
...and reporting for The Daily Planet.

255
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,394
- Are you still up for that interview?
- Well, give me half an hour.

256
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,430
Mr. Kent.

257
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,035
I was actually looking for you.

258
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,004
I'd like to see you in my office.

259
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:24,545
- You look like you feel a little out of place.
- I've never been in the principal's office.

260
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:28,750
You can start by sitting.
I'll cut right to the chase.

261
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,553
I think you're a slacker.

262
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,030
Quit the football team before you
played the first game...

263
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:39,967
...chronic tardiness,
zero extracurriculars.

264
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:45,141
I get very good grades and I write
for The Torch occasionally.

265
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,174
Retyping the cafeteria menu
isn't exactly writing.

266
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,180
I see a lot of untapped potential
in you, Mr. Kent.

267
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:56,647
Mr. Reynolds, I don't understand, we just
met. How could you judge me so quickly?

268
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,256
How do you know Lex Luthor?

269
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,889
Well, he's a friend of mine. Why?

270
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,427
A person is judged by
the company they keep.

271
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:10,432
Lex Luthor doesn't have friends.
He sees people as a means towards an end.

272
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,661
I don't think that's true.

273
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:17,539
Time will tell. Frankly, I'm more interested
in your world. What are your goals?

274
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,906
Well, I'd like to help people.

275
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,376
Something like that.

276
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:26,244
Helping people is a noble aspiration.
It's also rather vague.

277
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,785
Where are you gonna be
five years from now?

278
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,748
To tell the truth,
I'm not really sure.

279
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,858
Well, I'm gonna help you to focus.

280
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:39,464
I want you to write a five-page essay on
where you're gonna be five years from now.

281
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:44,034
And I want it on my desk
by the end of the school day on Friday.

282
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,071
Sir, why are you doing this to me?

283
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,266
This isn't punishment, Mr. Kent.

284
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,742
Consider it a challenge.

285
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:17,698
Clark, hey. Just in time to volunteer
for the decorations committee.

286
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,963
Actually, I've gotta finish my essay
for Mr. Reynolds.

287
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,767
That's a bummer. What's it about?

288
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,003
What the future theoretically
holds for me.

289
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,008
Who cares about the future?

290
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,151
- I like to think there's life after high school.
- Sure.

291
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:37,254
Yeah, as in a job, responsibilities,
getting old.

292
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,927
- Is everything all right?
- Of course.

293
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,205
Krissy, we've got the lighting
the way you want it.

294
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,605
Great. Let's see what you got.

295
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,608
Let me guess.

296
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,721
Reynolds wants to know where you
see yourself five years from now?

297
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,322
He made me do that assignment
when I was at Excelsior.

298
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,519
He's nothing if not consistent.

299
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:23,196
He doesn't exactly have
a high opinion of you.

300
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:28,635
I wasn't a model student, but imagine being
a bald 14-year-old in an elite prep school.

301
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:32,299
- Must have been tough.
- I had a major chip on my shoulder.

302
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:33,944
But Reynolds saw through it.

303
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:38,742
He challenged me to own up to my actions,
not to assume the mantle of the rich kid.

304
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,852
He was tough but fair.
I liked him for that.

305
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:47,515
I wish the feeling was mutual. Whatever he
has against you, he's taking it out on me.

306
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,593
I'm sorry being friends with me
comes with such a high price.

307
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:57,601
So exactly how long were you planning
to work on this essay?

308
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:01,238
I'm just not ready to go home yet.

309
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:09,074
- Something wrong?
- No, it's just family stuff.

310
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:12,180
Come on, Clark, I'm the king
of family dysfunction.

311
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:18,322
My father and grandfather hate each other,
and I feel caught in the middle.

312
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,458
And you'd like to play peacemaker.

313
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,083
Best thing to do is put them in a room
and let them fight it out.

314
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,560
So you're saying I should
play hardball.

315
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,631
That's up to you, but...

316
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,999
...it'll take that sort of determination to
bring your father and grandfather together.

317
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,269
What do you think?

318
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:43,073
Perfect.

319
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,509
- Thank you for doing this, Russell.
- It's been a weird week.

320
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:50,382
- Feels good to be doing something.
- I know you and Troy were friends.

321
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,519
I really miss him.

322
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,921
Well, that's why I came to see you,
Russell.

323
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:01,088
For Troy.

324
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,295
For the others.

325
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,303
The others?
What are you talking about?

326
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:15,068
The ones who will live inside me forever.

327
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:37,799
Hey, Dad, got a minute?

328
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:42,429
You gotta talk to me while we're working.
We got a lot to do before it gets dark.

329
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,235
There's someone I want you to see.

330
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:55,575
- Your mother put you up to this?
- No, this was all my idea.

331
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,016
Don't blame the boy.

332
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,817
The problems we have are between us.
Martha says you need help.

333
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,289
I'm here to give it.

334
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,193
- So now you want to be part of this family?
- I don't want anything from you.

335
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,892
I brought a check because
I won't watch my daughter suffer.

336
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,698
- Couldn't resist turning that knife?
- Dad, give him a chance.

337
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:17,865
- You two can work this out.
- I don't think so, son.

338
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:21,171
It's just like 20 years ago,
the same argument and attitude.

339
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:25,976
Not quite. It has been 20 years.
But everything I predicted has come true.

340
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:30,521
I knew Martha was making
a big mistake when she married you.

341
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,680
That's not true, Granddad.

342
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:36,150
You'll have to swallow
your pride to save this farm.

343
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:39,297
I don't need a lecture on how
to take care of my family.

344
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,922
You're just as stubborn and pig-headed
as you were the day we met.

345
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,126
You get off my land.

346
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,534
Gladly.

347
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,064
Granddad, wait.

348
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:54,109
- It wasn't supposed to be like this.
- Just let him go, son.

349
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,281
I know you had good intentions...

350
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,542
...but some things just can't change.

351
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,287
Let's unload the truck.

352
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:11,260
- Clark, wait up.
- Hey.

353
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,428
You look like the wind got
knocked out of you.

354
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,364
I'm just dealing with
some family issues.

355
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,137
You want to talk about it?

356
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,637
The more I talk about it,
the worse they get.

357
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:26,470
Did you guys hear about Russell?
They found his body behind the Talon.

358
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,113
- What happened?
- He aged, like, 100 years.

359
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,681
The police thought it was a homeless guy
until they found his ID.

360
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,513
Two progeria deaths in two days,
what are the odds?

361
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:40,090
Lana wanted to cancel the Spirit Week party
but Principal Reynolds asked her not to.

362
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,624
He said he wanted to
keep things normal.

363
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:47,254
He obviously hasn't had his normal meter
reset for Smallville.

364
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:57,333
- What is it, Clark?
- I saw Russell with Krissy at the Talon.

365
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,739
Troy was with her
before he went geriatric.

366
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:03,205
- It's not exactly a smoking gun.
- It's worth a look.

367
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:06,942
We could check out her old records.
See if there's anything strange.

368
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,985
I'll get started
and I'll tell you what I find.

369
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,656
Interesting choice.

370
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,923
The Count of Monte Cristo.

371
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:27,236
Classic tale of a man whose past
comes back to haunt him.

372
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,407
Why are you here, Lex?

373
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:36,175
We're upgrading our computer system
at the plant.

374
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:39,544
Thought we might donate our
old computers to Smallville High.

375
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,976
You are not an alumnus.

376
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,346
Call it a thank-you.

377
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:50,423
You pushed me.
And in hindsight, I appreciate that.

378
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,758
In some ways, you're responsible
for the man I am today.

379
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:57,527
I'm not sure that's a burden
I care to take on.

380
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:01,729
Besides the tax deduction,
what's the quid pro quo?

381
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,338
Now, why do you think
I want anything in return?

382
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,810
Because I've learned there's always a price
when dealing with the Luthors.

383
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:15,582
I want you to stop turning your antagonism
towards me against Clark Kent.

384
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,413
Lionel has taught you well.

385
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,357
- My father?
- Yes. This meeting?

386
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:27,225
It reminds me of the incident
that almost got you expelled.

387
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,959
- He had nothing to do with that.
- No, only later.

388
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,298
After receiving notice of
your expulsion hearing...

389
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:39,205
...he generously offered the school's
trustees a new library, with two conditions:

390
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:43,814
That you were allowed to stay,
and I was allowed to go.

391
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:50,844
History has an interesting way
of repeating itself, doesn't it?

392
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,794
Clark, I hope I'm not interrupting.

393
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:10,403
No, I could use the inspiration. I thought
you'd be swamped with party prep by now.

394
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:14,204
I was heading over to the Talon,
but this arrived at my house.

395
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,844
I asked Lex to look into those photos
of my mother.

396
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,976
You think there's more to it
than meets the eye?

397
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,681
I don't know, he sent me this.
I haven't opened it yet.

398
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:30,385
As badly as I want the truth,
I'm afraid I won't like what I find.

399
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,496
Why the change of heart?

400
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,430
The image of my parents the way
I thought they were is all I have.

401
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,092
You don't want to lose that.

402
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,034
Maybe just by doubting, I already have.

403
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,944
How are things with your grandfather?

404
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,909
"Disaster" is an understatement.

405
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:54,245
I took him to see my father.
It was like watching history repeat itself.

406
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,909
So, what's next?

407
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,813
I hate to see it end like this.

408
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,050
But I can't control the way
they act around each other.

409
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,785
Are you gonna try again?

410
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:08,823
I can't do anything about the past.
Maybe I can do something about the future.

411
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,964
- Clark.
- I don't want our relationship to end...

412
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,770
...before it ever had a chance to begin.

413
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:24,113
Well, you can come in
if you want.

414
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:29,343
But you'll have to excuse me,
I'm running a little late.

415
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,417
There's something I wanted
to show you.

416
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,661
It's our photo album.

417
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:43,665
School plays, camping trips, backyard
activities, stuff that families do together.

418
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,602
I wanted you to see our family
the way I do.

419
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:52,299
We're more than old arguments
and overdue bills.

420
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:57,171
I'd like you to give this
to your mother.

421
00:31:57,348 --> 00:32:01,148
It's a cashier's check. Tell her she can
use it now, a year from now...

422
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,688
...whenever she needs it.
- Why don't you give it to her yourself?

423
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:07,647
I'm sorry, Clark.

424
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:13,396
I don't understand how a man who hasn't
seen his family in 20 years can walk away.

425
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:25,803
- Krissy, I need to talk to you.
- Is there a problem, Mr. Reynolds?

426
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:29,037
I left three messages for your parents,
still no answer.

427
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,646
They've been really busy.

428
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:34,046
- Is this still about my transcripts?
- And you.

429
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,777
I've been making an effort to get
to know the students and parents.

430
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,187
Maybe I can come by your house
this weekend when they're home.

431
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,554
They'll be at the Talon for the rally.

432
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:48,859
- You could meet us there before the party.
- That'll be fine, see you there.

433
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,415
Where have you been?
I left you six messages.

434
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:12,113
- Sorry, it's been a weird day.
- Well, it's about to get weirder. Take a look.

435
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,690
Florida, 12 years ago,
Piper High School.

436
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:18,488
Three students died of the same
mysterious? Ber-progeria.

437
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,689
All in a 48-hour period.
Let me guess, Krissy was involved.

438
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,967
Try "Missy."

439
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,595
Class of '90, Missy Parker.

440
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:30,172
- Different name, same face.
- Yeah, it gets better.

441
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,735
Lakewood High, Class of '81...
There she is again.

442
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,608
You won't believe this. I matched Krissy
to triple progeria cases...

443
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:42,378
...going back to Hammond
School for Girls, class of 1921.

444
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:45,021
It's like she feeds off youth
to stay young.

445
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,784
Takes the Peter Pan complex
to a whole new level.

446
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,192
Troy was killed almost two days ago,
Russell was killed yesterday.

447
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,424
- Krissy's gonna need another victim.
- I'll call the police.

448
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:01,867
Clark?

449
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,586
Krissy?

450
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,407
Krissy?

451
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,577
Mr. Reynolds.

452
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,804
So, what do you think?

453
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,939
I think you've taken Spirit Week
to a whole new level.

454
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:52,052
- Are your parents here yet?
- Actually, Mr. Reynolds...

455
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,384
...they died. Over a century ago.

456
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,453
What are you talking about?

457
00:34:56,627 --> 00:35:00,620
See, I've seen the future, Mr. Reynolds,
again and again...

458
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:02,959
...and I've learned one thing:

459
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:11,899
These are the best years
of anyone's life.

460
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:20,216
Clark, thought you were the band.

461
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:24,979
If they don't show, we're stuck with
a half-dozen MP3s and my boom box.

462
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,351
Have you seen Krissy?

463
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,961
Yeah, she was just here.

464
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:44,207
- What's going on?
- Just go lock the door, don't let anyone in.

465
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,279
Krissy, stop!
I know what's going on.

466
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,375
You need help.

467
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,218
I need him.

468
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:03,518
I'm not gonna let you
hurt anyone else.

469
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,219
I am saving them, Clark.

470
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:09,855
From lives that will never be as happy
as they are right now.

471
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:14,127
- There's more to life than cheerleading.
- You're wrong.

472
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:19,909
You will never be this young,
this beautiful...

473
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,406
...or this perfect again.

474
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,542
But I will.

475
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,014
- More bills, huh, Dad?
- Yeah.

476
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,886
Seems like these darned things
keep right on coming.

477
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,086
Clark, you've had quite a week.
Any fallout from school?

478
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:15,699
- Spirit Week is officially kaput.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

479
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,265
Principal's gonna be okay.

480
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:21,098
He warned me about being late
when they loaded him into the ambulance.

481
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:25,303
I know the situation with your grandpa
is bugging you. It should, but...

482
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,876
I went to go see him.

483
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,376
He asked me to give this to you.

484
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:39,448
He said he tried to get involved
in my life after the adoption.

485
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,218
Why wouldn't you let him see me?

486
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:43,792
Well, it's complicated.

487
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:47,055
It can't be that complicated,
he's my grandfather.

488
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:51,335
Clark, when you were a little boy...

489
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,437
...you couldn't control
your abilities like now.

490
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:59,201
If he'd spent any time with us, I think
he might have found out your secret.

491
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:00,742
He's family.

492
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:04,608
We had such a history of disagreeing
on things...

493
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,273
...we just didn't know how he'd react.

494
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,784
We couldn't be sure we could trust him.

495
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:14,588
So he's not a part of our lives
because of me?

496
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:19,855
Son, every young man wants to have
a relationship with his grandpa.

497
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:23,825
But in your case,
it just may not be possible.

498
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,080
Lana.

499
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:40,578
- Working on something important?
- Just finished my essay.

500
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:45,518
- So where you gonna be in five years?
- In college, probably studying journalism.

501
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,819
You're kidding.

502
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,517
Don't tell Chloe,
but I think it's growing on me.

503
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:54,927
I like to find the truth behind things.
I'm tired of having secrets in my life.

504
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,464
And personally?

505
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:04,271
I've decided I'm gonna find a way to have
a relationship with my grandfather.

506
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,172
How about you, is everything okay?

507
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:11,473
Clark, I read Lex's file.

508
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:15,244
According to court papers,
my parents filed for divorce in 1985.

509
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:17,353
Irreconcilable differences.

510
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,354
- But they worked it out, right?
- Eventually.

511
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,584
But they were legally separated
for over a year.

512
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,820
- So the guy in the picture...?
- Could be more than a friend.

513
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:34,765
I was born right after my parents
got back together.

514
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:40,236
My father could still be alive.

515
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
