1
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,272
This engine won't start.
I don't know how to fix it.

2
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,670
You're home from school early.

3
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,594
Yeah, well, I sort of dropped out
for the rest of the semester.

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,876
Clark, how could you do that?

5
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,957
You need me here.
There's too much work.

6
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,873
- But...
- Mom, it's done.

7
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,311
The governor's office
wants to see me.

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,675
Something about
your father's senate seat.

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,832
It's the last thing I wanna do,
but I have to go to Metropolis.

10
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,436
While I'm there, <i>I...</i>

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,354
I thought I'd drop some of your father's
clothes off at the homeless shelter.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,870
Maybe it's too early
to get rid of them, but I...

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,509
It's so hard seeing them in the closet.

14
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,756
I can still smell his after-shave
on the shirts.

15
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,156
You should take a look, see if
there's something you wanna keep.

16
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,999
No, I'm sure there's someone
who can use it more than I can.

17
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,154
I think your father would have
wanted you to have this.

18
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,399
L... I remember the day he taught you
how to tell time with it.

19
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,152
You should wear it.

20
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,148
Well, if you're going to Metropolis,
you should go before it gets too dark.

21
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,918
- Hey, lady, need some help?
- No. Thank you. I can manage.

22
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,355
Don't do that.

23
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,156
- No!
- Nice bling, red.

24
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,358
That was my husband's.

25
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,871
Crazy bitch.

26
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,512
Slit her throat.

27
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,195
I've been looking for you.

28
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,351
Hey, back off, freak...

29
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,476
...or I cut her.

30
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,188
Don't worry, you're safe now.

31
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,674
Hey.

32
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,314
The muses weren't helping me
with my astronomy paper...

33
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,438
<i>...so</i> I thought I'd come by
and talk you into a frothy cappucc...

34
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,398
I was on my way to the hardware store.
I gotta pick up some supplies.

35
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,834
Clark, are you sure it can't wait?

36
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,956
Because I was really hoping
we could talk.

37
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,669
Clark, I understand.

38
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,556
You and your dad were really close.

39
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,757
- Lana...
- You don't have to open up to me.

40
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,276
You just can't keep
bottling this up inside.

41
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,753
Thanks for coming by. I really have to go,
the hardware store closes in a half-hour.

42
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,319
I'm sorry.

43
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,319
No, you're angry.

44
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,797
And you should be,
but don't keep hiding behind it.

45
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,791
Trust me, I've tried.

46
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,319
I know you're trying to help.

47
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,272
Thank you,
but you don't have to worry about me.

48
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,757
I'm fine.

49
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,077
Mom? What happened? Oh, my God.

50
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,596
I was dropping off the clothes,
these two guys came out of nowhere.

51
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,512
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm all right.

52
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,831
Clark, somebody rescued me.

53
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,512
But not before they...
They took your father's watch.

54
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,395
I just spent half the night
down at Metropolis PD.

55
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,994
Not one person can tell me
about who mugged my mom.

56
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,435
No, I've got that covered.
My mole at the precinct...

57
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,559
<i>...said</i> that he'd fax me the police report.
So your mom actually saw the vigilante?

58
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,915
Barely. She left
just before the police got there.

59
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,197
There have been rumors about her
flying around Suicide Slums for weeks.

60
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,874
But I couldn't get a confirmed eyewitness
until your mom.

61
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,350
Now this has front-page news
written all over it.

62
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,672
- The vigilante is for real.
- This is great, Chloe.

63
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,638
I let my mom go down to Suicide Slums
alone, she gets mugged...

64
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,153
<i>...and</i> you're cashing in on it.

65
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,592
Clark, I was just trying to help.
You don't have to bite my head off.

66
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,990
I should've accepted the watch
like my dad would've wanted.

67
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,957
I couldn't even look at it.

68
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,473
Now all I can think about
is getting it back.

69
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,674
I'm sorry.

70
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,518
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,158
- They are today's obits.
- Thanks.

72
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,588
I saw your car out front.
Looks like old habits die hard.

73
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,069
Mrs. Kent asked me to close up
for the night.

74
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,196
They're going through a lot right now.

75
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,399
Look...

76
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,029
- Lana...
- Lex, it's okay.

77
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,236
You already said, "I'm sorry."

78
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,356
Yeah, well, it means more
when it's <i>coming...</i>

79
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,476
<i>...from</i> someone who's not drunk.

80
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,478
It seemed you were pretty upset
with Clark that night. Things better?

81
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,274
None of that matters anymore.

82
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,115
I just wanna be able to help him
through this difficult time.

83
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,998
How's he doing?

84
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,395
Lex, we both know what it's like
to lose a parent. He's devastated.

85
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,678
Yeah, I tried to get ahold of him,
but he doesn't wanna see me.

86
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,513
Well, as much
as we both wanna help...

87
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,831
...I think all we can do
is really just be there for him.

88
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,359
He's... He's very lucky
to have you in his life, Lana.

89
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,715
But when the time comes
for you to lean on someone...

90
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,831
<i>...you</i> know I'm always here.

91
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,833
All right. Now, this
is what I need, Clark:

92
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,992
A catchy moniker
for our new crime fighter.

93
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,315
"Miss Death-Wish." No, that's lame.

94
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,597
"Dirty Harriet."
No, that's too derivative.

95
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,398
I got it. I got it, Clark.

96
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,154
So your mom said that she
swooped down from the heavens.

97
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,278
So how about
"The Angel of v engeance."

98
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,519
- Chloe, police report.
- Right. I'm sorry, clark.

99
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,035
Once I go Woodward and Bernstein,
I get carried away.

100
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,952
I'll go check the fax.

101
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,555
I heard you were asking around
about me.

102
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,951
Something tells me a front-page story
could be a little bad for my health.

103
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,271
- Let it go, <i>comprende?</i>
- Hey, what are you doing?

104
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,873
Stay out of my way.
I'm one of the good guys.

105
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,311
- Clark, are you all right?
- Yeah.

106
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,159
I guess round one
goes to the X chromosomes, huh?

107
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,276
How about that costume,
how cool was that?

108
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,158
A little over the top.
Police reports?

109
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,232
Oh, yeah, of course. You know,
chokehold and everything aside...

110
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,960
...I gotta give the girl props
for patrolling the street.

111
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,317
Now, I just wonder if we're dealing
with natural-born-ninja territory...

112
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,948
<i>...or</i> if she's just another
garden-variety meteor freak.

113
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,315
- Whatever she is, she's got issues.
- Come on, Clark.

114
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,879
You can't tell me
that you have never crossed...

115
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,600
...any boundaries
to protect your identity.

116
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,957
Looks like I'm gonna have to get
to know her a lot more than I wanted to.

117
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,680
No leads. Your Angel of Vengeance
might be the only one...

118
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,671
...who can ID the guys
who mugged my mom.

119
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,558
After the way she chop-sockied
you tonight...

120
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,154
<i>...I</i> wouldn't hold out
for an invitation to tea.

121
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,352
We might not have to.

122
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,478
- No! No. Please help. No. No. Help!
- Give me the purse.

123
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,269
No! Help me. Help me!

124
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,753
You know what? We've taken
this show on the road all over town...

125
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,512
<i>...and</i> this obviously isn't working.

126
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,477
Because you're not
screaming loud enough.

127
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,794
Clark, I have freaked out every alley cat
within a four-block radius.

128
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,709
Look, let's just go one more time.
One more, come on. Take it, come on.

129
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,395
- Ready? Go.
- No. Help. Please.

130
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,993
- Come on.
- No. Please. Help.

131
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,435
You gotta give it some feeling,
some passion.

132
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,397
Stop!

133
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,832
You again?

134
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,072
- I didn't come here for a fight.
- Well, I'm not wearing dance shoes.

135
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,433
If I'd known you wanted a duel,
I would've brought my own pistol.

136
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,469
Oh, no, this isn't a weapon, Lex.
This is a piece of history.

137
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,189
A gift
from a grateful overseas partner.

138
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,989
That's right, a duel would require you
to face your opponent.

139
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,909
You prefer to strike
when they least expect it.

140
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,110
Oh, yeah, the activity this morning
in the Asian markets.

141
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,952
Is that what you mean? I heard.

142
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,876
Brokers were buying up shares
of LuthorCorp...

143
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,076
...like they were half-price potstickers.

144
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,037
Come on, Dad...

145
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,120
...you're just using the chinese.

146
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,068
I know you're the one leading
the Apex Group's hostile takeover.

147
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,150
And I didn't think
you were paying attention.

148
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,151
I'm pleased to see
that is not the case.

149
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,392
Wipe that smug smile off your face.
I won't let it happen.

150
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,155
How you gonna stop it?
Leveraged recapitalization?

151
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,031
Your campaign directly compromised
Luthorcorp's assets.

152
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,351
There's not a single bank
that will give you the money you need.

153
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,515
So, what are you gonna do
for an encore?

154
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,355
- Put a bullet in my head?
- Don't be so melodramatic, Lex.

155
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,555
I would never fire this. It's priceless.

156
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,599
You know, General MacArthur wore this
when he came back to the Philippines.

157
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,793
What was it he said, son?

158
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,913
"I have returned."

159
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,600
Don't get ahead of yourself, Dad.

160
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,917
You haven't taken the beach yet.

161
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,794
You want a show-and-tell, meathead?
Why don't you go first.

162
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,835
I don't know.

163
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,476
I was born this way.

164
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,909
You're lucky. The worst part
is remembering...

165
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,275
...what it was like to be normal.

166
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,512
- But then how did you...?
- Turn into a freak of nature?

167
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,109
When I got a heart transplant,
six months ago.

168
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,952
A girl dies in a meteor shower...

169
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,272
...and suddenly I get a souped-up
second chance. You have no idea...

170
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,228
<i>...what</i> it's like to know that
someone's life has been traded for yours.

171
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,913
That's why I carry this.

172
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,634
So I'll never forget.

173
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,392
I'm kind of allergic.

174
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,632
To a rock? Okay, whatever.

175
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,272
So I guess you and Sullivan have
all the dirt you need on me now...

176
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,919
...to write your little article.

177
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,752
I'm not here to expose you.

178
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,674
I need your help.

179
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,671
You saved my mom earlier tonight.

180
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,513
Some guys were trying to mug her
outside the Eastside shelter.

181
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,035
- They took a watch.
- Sorry...

182
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,316
...but there are people down here
who need a lot more help...

183
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,072
...than finding some missing Timex.

184
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,912
Belonged to my dad.

185
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,392
You lost him, didn't you?
And you can't say goodbye.

186
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,599
- What makes you say that?
- Because I've never been able to.

187
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,275
My mom and I were coming home
from my gymnastics meet...

188
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,474
...and these two guys mugged us.

189
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,033
I didn't even feel the knife
go into my heart.

190
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,193
When I looked up...

191
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,270
...I saw her lying there.

192
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,030
And they walked away laughing.

193
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,309
Is that why you do this?

194
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,918
She dedicated her life
to this group, Acrata.

195
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,197
They fought the gangs, the dealers...

196
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,238
...even the suits who wanted
to tear down our homes.

197
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,348
She was this little woman...

198
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,239
...but she was a badass.

199
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,072
It's not fair.

200
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,675
It's not fair to have someone like that
just ripped out of your life.

201
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,551
I can help you get the watch back.

202
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,471
But that's not
what you're really after, is it?

203
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,278
- You want justice, just like me.
- Can you tell me where they are?

204
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,635
They're part of
the Thirteenth Street Gang...

205
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,509
...but the guy you want
has gone underground...

206
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,910
<i>...and</i> his gang's all packing 9 mils.

207
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,070
But I'm in if you're in.

208
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,598
- Mrs. Kent, what are you doing here?
- Looking for Clark. Have you seen him?

209
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,317
Yeah, about an hour ago,
he left me holding the bag, literally.

210
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,036
Hey, you know, I heard what happened.
It's good to see that you're okay.

211
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,549
Don't worry about clark.
I'm sure he'll pop up soon.

212
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,396
- Or blur in, or whatever it is he does.
- He's been gone all night.

213
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,269
He's not answering his cell phone.
It's not like him.

214
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,476
There's a lot
that's not been like him lately.

215
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,551
He's trying to find those guys,
isn't he?

216
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,273
Chloe, I know you have a lot
of secrets you have to keep...

217
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,271
<i>...but</i> this isn't one of them.

218
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,228
- He feels really guilty about the watch.
- And me.

219
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,959
Well, I think he's willing to feel anything
except for the pain of saying goodbye.

220
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,631
But that doesn't keep it
from being real.

221
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,678
The more he refuses to go through this,
the worse it's gonna get.

222
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,753
I know.
I'm trying to do everything I <i>can...</i>

223
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,639
<i>...but</i> I don't think denial's
that unusual.

224
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,032
But clark is. He's gotta take
all those emotions out somewhere.

225
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,189
- Or on someone.
- And when he does...

226
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,875
<i>...I'm</i> afraid of what might happen.
We both know what he's capable of.

227
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,237
Yeah, but clark's always managed
to keep things in perspective.

228
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,154
It's just that Jonathan
was always there.

229
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,834
He always knew what to say.

230
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,152
Mrs. Kent,
I don't think that he was the only one.

231
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,471
When he died...

232
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,879
<i>...I</i> really didn't know
if I could keep the secret by myself.

233
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,155
It's good to know you're here.

234
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,358
Thank you.

235
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,790
He's gonna be okay.

236
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,714
We won't let anything happen to him.

237
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,792
That's the guy he was with.

238
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,793
Sorry, this isn't a costume party.

239
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,672
Whoa there, Jethro.

240
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,276
Maybe you should put the brawn away
and let the brains handle this.

241
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,399
Looks like somebody got the best of you.
We're looking for that friend of yours.

242
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,597
You know, the one
with the serpentine-facial graffiti.

243
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,354
- So why you talking to me?
- Because he's gone kind of AWOL.

244
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,274
- And he's got something of mine.
- We want it back. Tell us where he is.

245
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,990
You know what? Just tell
him we're looking for him.

246
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,989
What are you doing?
So much for brains winning out.

247
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,991
<i>Snake, it's Ono. That chick</i>
<i>showed up with some boy scout.</i>

248
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,469
<i>They said to tell you</i>
<i>they're looking for you.</i>

249
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,996
Can you check the last number
he dialed?

250
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,879
Well, I guess my go-to status
has been reinstated.

251
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,837
For a while there,
I thought maybe I'd been <i>replaced...</i>

252
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,230
...by the leather-clad version.

253
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,398
- You always change in a phone booth?
- The janitor was in the bathroom.

254
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,718
I thought the glasses were fake?

255
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,269
Are you kidding? I'm blind as a bat.

256
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,477
Besides, the mask doesn't look
so good with glasses over it.

257
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,510
Acuvue to the rescue.

258
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,956
Those were some impressive moves
you used to jack that phone.

259
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,795
- I could use a sidekick more often.
- I'm not a sidekick.

260
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,719
We should find a reverse list.

261
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,350
Yeah, and then maybe we can
just bypass the log-on page.

262
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,238
Got it covered.

263
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,713
That's why you work here, isn't it?

264
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,957
Nothing happens in Metropolis
without going through the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

265
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,233
Way to put the pieces
together, Brenda Starr.

266
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,150
Unless Snake's real name is Beatrice
Krauss, I think he's using a stolen phone.

267
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,992
Can you pull up the outgoing calls?

268
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,788
Looks like he's a proud
supporter of Fantasy Fone.

269
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,349
More importantly, deep-dish pizza.

270
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,034
Yes, I'd like to make
an order for delivery.

271
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,351
My number's 555-0138.

272
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,193
1436 Stanton Street.
Yes, that's my address. Thank you.

273
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,999
Looks like it's time to call the police.

274
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,593
- No.
- No.

275
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,832
Clark, don't you think you're
a little too close to this?

276
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,833
Chloe, if I don't use my abilities
to stop lowlifes like this...

277
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,070
...what's the point in having them?

278
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,913
I really don't think
that you should be go...

279
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,750
Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him.

280
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,670
How is it that trash like you
is still alive, and my dad's dead?

281
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,237
Better leave now or you'll be dead too.

282
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,197
You stole my dad's watch.
I want it back.

283
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,430
I don't know
what you're talking about.

284
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,673
- I don't have it anymore. I sold it.
- It was my dad's.

285
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,349
What are you waiting for?
He deserves to die.

286
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,040
- Lf you won't kill him, I will.
- No.

287
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,832
I'm sorry. I have to do this.

288
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,517
You.

289
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,356
Is this the knife
you used to kill my mother?

290
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,431
No. He's not worth it.

291
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,991
You didn't have to kill her.
She gave you all the money she had.

292
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,755
It wasn't about the money.
I was told to make it look like a mugging.

293
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,950
- It was a hit?
- She was in their way.

294
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,032
Whose? Who hired you?

295
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,190
The suits. Those Apex suits, the ones
that are tearing down the slums.

296
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,510
I want a name.

297
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,995
Andrea.

298
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,951
All I know is, the guy that hired me
got a call from Lionel Luthor.

299
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,353
Don't.

300
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,835
No!

301
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,873
I see you've already moved in. Don't you
think that's a little premature, Dad?

302
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,110
The board doesn't meet
on the bid until morning.

303
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,271
I value efficiency, Lex. You know that.

304
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,555
I hear you ran
a hectic phone bank today.

305
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,554
Must be humbling to pull all those strings
and find out they're attached to nothing.

306
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,837
Especially when your father's
the one holding the scissors.

307
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,915
You left the company vulnerable.

308
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,120
Then I suppose
I should be thanking you.

309
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,794
If you hadn't tried to take it,
someone else would have.

310
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,556
Exactly. What good is having a family
if they don't watch out for each other?

311
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,235
On the off chance...

312
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,279
...that unshakable family loyalty fails...

313
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,193
...there's always those Luthor closets
to rummage through.

314
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,351
All right. Let's skip the prologue, Lex.

315
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,829
What ancient skeleton
do you think you've dug up now?

316
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,151
Well, it's not quite a skeleton yet.

317
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,073
More like a freshly laid corpse.

318
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,630
I wonder
how Martha Kent would feel...

319
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,476
...if she knew you had a secret meeting
with her husband right before he died.

320
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,519
Now, a transgression like that would...

321
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,150
...test the virtues of even
the most forgiving woman.

322
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,511
What do you want, Lex?

323
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,473
I hope you enjoyed your stay.

324
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,276
Sorry it was so short.

325
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,119
Snake?

326
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,878
Snake?

327
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,672
You're a dead man.

328
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,031
You kicked people
out of their homes...

329
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,430
...so you could develop
Suicide Slums for profit.

330
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,910
My mother stood up to you,
so you had her murdered.

331
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,231
No one escapes justice, Luthor.
Not even you.

332
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,710
Listen to me. We're not as different
as you might think.

333
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,393
Like you know anything about me.

334
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,030
I do. I grew up on the same
treacherous streets that you did.

335
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,158
I lost my parents, just like you did,
to a senseless crime.

336
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,390
It wasn't senseless. It was calculated.

337
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,917
Andrea. Stop. Let the police do their job.
If he's guilty, he'll pay.

338
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,230
If your father was murdered...

339
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,393
...and you were face to face
with his killer, what would you do?

340
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,150
What if you're wrong?
What if he had nothing to do with it?

341
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,435
Andrea, listen to him. Listen.

342
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,989
Look, I know what's in your heart.

343
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,317
It's anger. I feel it too.

344
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,233
But killing him, taking his life
is not gonna change anything.

345
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,598
- Yes, it will.
- Andrea, stop. Think about your mother.

346
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,874
Is this what she would
want you to do?

347
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,877
Let him go.
Let him go and everything will be okay.

348
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,070
I killed a man.

349
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,874
And I know you, Clark.

350
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,873
You could never let me
walk out of here.

351
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,876
It's time for you to be the real hero.

352
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,992
Exceptional woman.
Grossly misguided.

353
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,355
She's been through a lot.

354
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,110
Why do I think you saved my life
for her sake, not for mine?

355
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,270
Whatever the reason...

356
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,996
...thank you, son.

357
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,034
Martha, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

358
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,633
It's all right.

359
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,992
I was somewhere else.

360
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:34,393
Yes. These days must be difficult
to get through. I understand.

361
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,553
When my wife... When Lillian died, I...

362
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,439
I thought I'd never
be whole again. I...

363
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,560
It takes a long time
to let yourself heal.

364
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,314
Well, I'm doing the best I can.

365
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,871
I hear the governor has asked you
to take Jonathan's seat in the senate.

366
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,432
I haven't even told clark about that.
How do you know?

367
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,550
I make it a point to know things. I...

368
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,756
I wanted to find out how you were.

369
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,516
I'm not sure I'm going to
accept the offer.

370
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,399
If you came by to sway me
one way or the other.

371
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,633
No, you're quite capable of making
that decision on your own. I...

372
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,270
I'm only sorry
that they burdened you with this.

373
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,113
You've got so much
to deal with now, Martha.

374
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,037
I know that Jonathan leveraged
a good part of the farm.

375
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,192
- That was his decision.
- That was his pride.

376
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,194
So he could pay back
the campaign contribution I made.

377
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,710
I can't accept it.

378
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,435
Jonathan and I let politics
and money come between us.

379
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,752
I don't want that
to happen to us, Martha.

380
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,760
If you need anything...

381
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,798
...please, I'm here for you, always.

382
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,310
As a friend.

383
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,718
Hey.

384
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,789
I found her desk like this
when I got in this morning.

385
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,428
I called her home, her cell.

386
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,160
Looks like she pulled
an Amelia Earhart.

387
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,553
She's never gonna let
anyone find her now.

388
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,911
I guess exile's the price
you have to pay...

389
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,469
...when you play judge,
jury and executioner.

390
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,358
Yeah.

391
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,560
Clark, what really happened out there?

392
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,508
I should have listened to you, Chloe.
You tried to warn me.

393
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,076
I had my hand
around that guy's throat.

394
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,909
And I thought that if I just kept
squeezing the life out of him...

395
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,076
...then it would make
everything right again.

396
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,957
God, Clark.

397
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,517
- But you didn't?
- No.

398
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,110
What made you stop?

399
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,039
My dad's voice.

400
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,758
This is gonna sound weird,
but l... I could hear him.

401
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,112
He was the one who always kept me
from going over the edge...

402
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,191
...when I was too close.

403
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,635
It's too bad Andrea
didn't step back in time.

404
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,315
I think Metropolis could really
use someone like her right now.

405
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,675
Do you think you could ever
do what she did?

406
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,118
Play the mild-mannered reporter by day
and a crime fighter by night?

407
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,877
Honestly, I'm kind of hoping
I can find a way...

408
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,793
...to not have to hide who I really am.

409
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,037
I searched every pawnshop
in Metropolis for it.

410
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,754
I can't believe you found this.

411
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,832
Lana...

412
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,109
I'm sorry for the way I've been acting.

413
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,636
I know I should be able to move on,
but life without him...

414
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,471
...doesn't feel real.

415
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,312
It's like you're <i>frozen...</i>

416
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,995
<i>...and</i> the whole world's
going on around you.

417
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,672
No matter how many people
wanna be there for you...

418
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,479
...you end up going through this alone.

419
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,390
It's not like he ever let me take
the easy way out either, huh?

420
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,358
Put it on.

421
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,429
It looks great.
Your dad would be really happy.

422
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,918
<i>Here, go that way.</i>
<i>Make a figure eight.</i>

423
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,354
<i>Please be careful.</i>

424
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,988
<i>Don 't worry, sweetheart.</i>
<i>It's gonna be fine.</i>

425
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,230
<i>That's what you always say.</i>

426
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,433
<i>- That way?</i>
<i>- Hang on tight.</i>

427
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,397
<i>What, are you kidding?</i>

428
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,751
<i>This young man 's a man of steel.</i>
<i>Look at him.</i>

429
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,712
<i>- Make one more turn.</i>
<i>- Where you going?</i>

430
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,677
<i>I thought I'd show our son</i>
<i>the back 40.</i>

431
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,071
<i>After all, it's all gonna</i>
<i>be his one day. Right?</i>

432
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,875
<i>Clark, wave bye to Mommy, son.</i>

433
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,472
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

434
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,071
