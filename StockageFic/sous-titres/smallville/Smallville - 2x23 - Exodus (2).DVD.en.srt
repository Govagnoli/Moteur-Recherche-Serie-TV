1
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:18,408
Fear not, Kal-El.

2
00:00:18,408 --> 00:00:19,961
Who are you?

3
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:22,661
I am Jor-El...

4
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:24,347
your father.

5
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:25,956
I thought you died!

6
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:30,253
I am his memory, his will.

7
00:00:30,253 --> 00:00:35,979
I am to fulfill his promise and
guide you all the days of your life.

8
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:39,084
You are the last son of Krypton.

9
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:41,375
When you traveled through the cosmos,

10
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,424
you carried the hopes and
dreams of your people.

11
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:47,674
They now live through you, Kal-El.

12
00:00:47,674 --> 00:00:49,362
It is time.

13
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:50,459
Time for what?

14
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:54,085
Time to accept your destiny.

15
00:00:54,728 --> 00:00:57,565
I don't know what you have
in mind for me, but I--

16
00:00:57,565 --> 00:01:00,832
By the setting of the sun Sol,

17
00:01:00,832 --> 00:01:02,974
you will return to me.

18
00:01:02,974 --> 00:01:08,510
Your destiny will be fulfilled.

19
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,414
Your thoughts are not
a mystery to me, Kal-El.

20
00:01:12,414 --> 00:01:16,315
These people have served their purpose.

21
00:01:16,315 --> 00:01:21,097
It is time to leave them.

22
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:28,114
Please!

23
00:01:28,114 --> 00:01:32,032
Everything and everyone
I love is here! In Smallville!

24
00:01:32,032 --> 00:01:34,876
You must let go of your past.

25
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:37,814
I will guide you to your future.

26
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:41,454
No, I don't want your guidance!

27
00:01:41,454 --> 00:01:43,911
I want to create my own future!

28
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:48,749
You have no choice, Kal-El.

40
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,697
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON WB:  2003/5/20

41
00:02:56,689 --> 00:02:59,216
Well, you're up early.

42
00:02:59,216 --> 00:03:01,261
I never went to sleep.

43
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:02,937
Clark?

44
00:03:02,937 --> 00:03:05,648
What's wrong?

45
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:12,412
I kind of met my biological father last night.

46
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,483
When I heard his voice,
it was coming from the ship.

47
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:26,586
But it sounded like
it was from my own head.

48
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:28,264
He said it was time.

49
00:03:28,264 --> 00:03:29,780
Said it was time for what?

50
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,677
To leave Smallville and fulfill my destiny.

51
00:03:32,677 --> 00:03:35,610
He said that?

52
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,320
I have until sundown today.

53
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,796
Or what?

54
00:03:38,796 --> 00:03:41,171
I'm not sure.

55
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:43,861
He said I didn't have a choice.

56
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:47,135
Why is it happening now when
my life is just coming together?

57
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:50,764
The farm's out of debt,
I'm gonna be a big brother...

58
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,247
Lana and I are finally getting together.

59
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:57,988
Whatever your biological father
may have had in mind for you,

60
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:02,690
they're his hopes and dreams,
not yours.

61
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,068
Clark, you choose your own destiny.

62
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:12,255
Nobody can decide that for you, son.

63
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:22,285
This is my home.

64
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:25,228
And you're my parents.

65
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:31,441
It's where I belong, and
I'm not going anywhere.

66
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:05,680
I haven't seen you two
together since, um,

67
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,827
well Dad, since you tried to
bribe Helen into dumping me.

68
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:14,547
And now Dr. Bryce refuses to accept this,
my wedding gift to her.

69
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:21,378
If you two, uh, star-crossed
lovers will excuse me.

70
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:25,127
You, uh, you want to tell me
what that was all about?

71
00:05:25,127 --> 00:05:28,173
Exactly what your father said.

72
00:05:28,173 --> 00:05:34,643
You know what? I'm tired of being
a pawn in this never-ending struggle.

73
00:05:34,643 --> 00:05:38,383
We both said some things last night.

74
00:05:38,383 --> 00:05:42,762
I don't want to go into this marriage
with any secrets between us.

75
00:05:42,762 --> 00:05:47,508
I haven't held anything back.

76
00:05:59,597 --> 00:06:01,401
I have.

77
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:03,977
Look inside.

78
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:13,917
I did break into your office,

79
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:18,229
and that's what I was after.

80
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:21,464
I told you because
I'm trying to break the cycle.

81
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,429
I don't want to be the person
who did this anymore.

82
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:28,765
But you did do it, Lex.
You committed a crime.

83
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:31,774
You violated my privacy
and that of my patients.

84
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:32,773
I know.

85
00:06:32,773 --> 00:06:34,255
What did you think would happen?

86
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:36,669
That you'd give it back,
tell me what you did, and

87
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:40,836
I'd just forgive you and
we would live happily ever after?

88
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:43,725
I don't know what I expected.

89
00:06:43,725 --> 00:06:46,768
All I know is that I love you.

90
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:52,382
I'm sure in some part of
that twisted mind you do.

91
00:06:52,382 --> 00:06:56,684
I didn't have it analyzed.

92
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:05,761
What was so important
about this blood, anyway?

93
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:09,996
I thought it would give me
the answers I've been looking for.

94
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:17,082
All it did was end this relationship.

95
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:34,459
Are you okay?

96
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:40,525
Yeah, I'm great.

97
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:49,410
You know, I can always tell when
you're being less than truthful.

98
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,821
It's just that...

99
00:07:53,821 --> 00:08:00,021
I've waited for this
for so long, for us.

100
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,406
I just don't want it to go away.

101
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:06,357
I'm not going anywhere.

102
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:12,413
Neither am I.

103
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:32,816
So, uh, does this mean you're
officially my date to Lex's wedding?

104
00:08:33,282 --> 00:08:40,224
Only after we officially tell Chloe
about our change in status.

105
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:46,238
Clark, I've been avoiding her all day.

106
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:51,966
All right, just let me tell her.

107
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:57,770
Chloe and I agreed that we'd be
upfront about things like this.

108
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:05,198
Well, I'm sure if we're
honest, she'll be fine.

109
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:20,998
I never realized the small town
press could be so pithy.

110
00:09:20,998 --> 00:09:23,250
What do you think your father's up to?

111
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:28,423
Apparently he's already got a team working overtime
installing some pretty sophisticated machinery down there.

112
00:09:28,423 --> 00:09:30,543
What for?

113
00:09:30,543 --> 00:09:35,540
I wish I could tell you, but I'm the last person
he'd ever let back into those caves.

114
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:41,127
He's tightened security.
I doubt even you'll be able to get past.

115
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:46,823
Uh, where's this tailor?
I'm kind of pressed for time today.

116
00:09:46,823 --> 00:09:49,192
I canceled him.

117
00:09:49,516 --> 00:09:51,078
Why?

118
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:55,066
Because Helen's not walking
down the aisle tomorrow.

119
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:59,461
I saw her last night.
She seemed really happy.

120
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:00,986
Yeah, well,

121
00:10:00,986 --> 00:10:03,438
a lot can change in 24 hours.

122
00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:06,678
Why'd she break it off?

123
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:11,039
I've always been fighting my destiny,

124
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,623
trying to avoid becoming my father.

125
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:20,181
But we all have certain genes that, no matter
how much we want to change, dominate us.

126
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:23,258
What'd you do?

127
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:26,209
I betrayed Helen's trust.

128
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:33,014
Then I fought my own nature and
did something very unLuthor-like.

129
00:10:33,014 --> 00:10:39,051
I confessed my sin,
hoping she'd forgive me.

130
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:43,691
My guess is she didn't.

131
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:46,410
Don't tell anyone, Clark.

132
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:52,920
I want to hold onto my romantic
notions for one more day.

133
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,202
I'm gonna have to put a stop
to these unauthorized visits.

134
00:11:23,202 --> 00:11:25,397
Mr. Luthor.

135
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:27,932
What are you doing here?

136
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:30,257
I was just curious.

137
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,285
I suppose so.

138
00:11:34,285 --> 00:11:39,880
According to poor Dr. Walden, you're
talked about quite a bit on these walls.

139
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,920
Apparently you are going to rule us all.

140
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,132
I'm surprised someone like you, Mr. Luthor,
would put stock in anything he had to say.

141
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:51,302
I know you worked closely
with the man, Clark.

142
00:11:51,302 --> 00:11:58,217
I'm sure there are insights you could give me.
It would be extremely helpful.

143
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:02,825
- He didn't tell me anything.
- Hmm.

144
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:06,313
What's with all the machinery?

145
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:16,936
I'm going to unlock the secrets
hidden in these walls.

146
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:20,893
Didn't you see what happened
to Dr. Walden? It's dangerous.

147
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:25,029
Yes, but I have something
he didn't. The key.

148
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:30,705
Once I insert that key into the slot,

149
00:12:30,705 --> 00:12:36,179
I'm convinced the answers
will be revealed to me.

150
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:38,852
I don't understand. I thought the
key was stolen from your vault.

151
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:44,885
It was, but before it mysteriously
disappeared, I had it analyzed.

152
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:49,224
The composition was unique.

153
00:12:49,224 --> 00:12:54,837
There's nothing like it on Earth,
with one exception.

154
00:12:56,006 --> 00:13:01,240
The meteor rocks
found here in Smallville.

155
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,934
So I have fashioned my own key.

156
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:15,036
It's identical in every detail.

157
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:20,539
Isn't it beautiful?
Look.

158
00:13:20,774 --> 00:13:22,418
Clark?

159
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:26,436
You don't look well.
Are you all right?

160
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:28,450
I'm fine.

161
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,325
Just...

162
00:13:31,325 --> 00:13:33,552
be careful.

163
00:13:33,552 --> 00:13:38,423
Lionel Luthor's never gotten
anywhere in life playing it safe.

164
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:52,443
I'm sure you'll render Clark speechless.

165
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:53,592
Chloe, hi.

166
00:13:53,592 --> 00:13:57,266
Be careful you two don't upstage
the bride and groom.

167
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:58,431
What do you mean?

168
00:13:58,431 --> 00:14:01,225
You two are going together,
I assume.

169
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:04,528
Yeah, yeah.
As friends.

170
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:08,704
Right. Friends.

171
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,397
Have you seen Clark?
He's been looking for you.

172
00:14:12,397 --> 00:14:14,757
No. Uh, I've been trying to
track him down all day,

173
00:14:14,757 --> 00:14:20,037
but his parents said that he
was mired in best man duties.

174
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:23,737
Uh, when did you see him last?

175
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:27,104
Oh, um, I ran into him
at the Talon. He, uh,

176
00:14:27,104 --> 00:14:29,319
wanted to talk to you,
said it was important.

177
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:32,755
Well, I guess it couldn't be
as important as you thought.

178
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:35,727
Have fun tomorrow.

179
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:55,644
I figured this is where I'd find you.

180
00:14:56,053 --> 00:14:58,954
Just watching the sunset.

181
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:02,215
I hope it's not the last one
I see from up here.

182
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:05,062
It won't be, Clark.

183
00:15:05,263 --> 00:15:09,511
Son, it's just another sundown.

184
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,060
Come on. Your mother's
got dinner ready.

185
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,143
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

186
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,243
Dad?

187
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,494
Yeah.

188
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:49,732
Thanks for always believing in me.

189
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:54,842
You're welcome, son.

190
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:05,934
It is time, Kal-El.

191
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:09,172
Come to me.

192
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:23,810
You will obey me, Kal-El.

193
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,620
You're not my father.

194
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,618
I won't let you control me.

195
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,196
This is the mark of your ancestors.

196
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:49,458
You cannot fight it, Kal-El.

197
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:55,795
At the zenith of the star Sol,
you will begin your journey.

198
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:02,173
If you do not,

199
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:06,730
you will hurt the ones
you love most.

200
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:25,937
Clark! Why aren't you ready?

201
00:17:25,937 --> 00:17:28,481
The wedding doesn't start for a few hours.

202
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,993
Your mother wants to get a good seat, son.

203
00:17:29,993 --> 00:17:33,504
I promised Helen I'd go
early and check the flowers.

204
00:17:33,504 --> 00:17:36,047
Well, I gotta pick up Lana,
so I'll meet you there.

205
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:41,545
We obviously have to get used
to the fact that you have a girlfriend now.

206
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:47,086
Clark.

207
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,774
How's it going today, son?

208
00:17:49,774 --> 00:17:51,217
Good.

209
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:53,654
No voice?

210
00:17:53,654 --> 00:17:54,466
No voice.

211
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:57,234
Looks like you're just gonna have to
face the future the old-fashioned way.

212
00:17:57,234 --> 00:17:59,870
I guess so. It's pretty scary.

213
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,665
Yeah.

214
00:18:02,846 --> 00:18:04,154
Mom?

215
00:18:04,154 --> 00:18:06,236
Yes.

216
00:18:06,615 --> 00:18:09,584
You look beautiful today.

217
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:13,348
Thank you, sweetheart.

218
00:18:33,998 --> 00:18:35,703
Helen.

219
00:18:37,107 --> 00:18:38,083
You're here.

220
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,912
I am so angry at you.

221
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,696
What you did was unforgivable.

222
00:18:43,696 --> 00:18:44,628
You're right.

223
00:18:44,628 --> 00:18:49,173
But the farther I got
from you and this town...

224
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:54,449
I realized that while any sane
person would've kept driving,

225
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:57,070
I needed to turn around.

226
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:03,805
I started to look at myself and the
mistakes that I've made in my life.

227
00:19:04,131 --> 00:19:06,342
I hope I'm not one of them.

228
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:11,343
No, Lex, you're not.

229
00:19:11,343 --> 00:19:14,443
That's the thing.

230
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:20,030
I still love you.

231
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:25,793
Oh, man.

232
00:19:26,978 --> 00:19:28,149
Does it hurt?

233
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:30,638
No. Not now.

234
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:33,903
You got any idea what it means?

235
00:19:34,421 --> 00:19:38,496
It's my biological father's way of telling me I have to do what he wants.

236
00:19:38,496 --> 00:19:42,695
I'm afraid by noon, it'll control me.

237
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:46,760
Your parents must be freaked out.

238
00:19:48,184 --> 00:19:51,249
I didn't tell them.

239
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:52,975
Why wouldn't you tell them, Clark?

240
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:55,956
Because, Pete,
I know what I have to do.

241
00:19:55,956 --> 00:20:00,229
They'll never agree with me
in a million years.

242
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:02,594
I have to destroy the ship.

243
00:20:02,594 --> 00:20:04,054
What?

244
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:06,059
Clark, no.

245
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,257
This thing traveled millions
of miles through space.

246
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:10,523
I don't think we can dent it,
much less destroy it.

247
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:12,782
What if we had a Kryptonite key?

248
00:20:12,782 --> 00:20:14,786
Clark, this is whacked!

249
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:16,509
Pete...

250
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:18,086
do you remember Lana's necklace?

251
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:19,935
Yeah, but what's that have to
do with destroying the ship?

252
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:23,636
Everything, Pete. When Tina Grier tied
me up down here, it nearly killed me.

253
00:20:23,636 --> 00:20:27,400
But before it could,
the ship neutralized it.

254
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,262
You said the ship was protecting you

255
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:32,361
What if it's actually protecting itself?

256
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:34,183
Think about it, Pete.

257
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:39,179
I'm from Krypton and so is this ship and
what's the one thing that can kill me?

258
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,887
So you're thinking that Kryptonite
can destroy the ship.

259
00:20:45,232 --> 00:20:48,246
Clark, it's too dangerous.

260
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:52,310
Do you hear me? You've never done
this before. You don't know what'll happen.

261
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:56,976
It could kill you.

262
00:20:58,764 --> 00:21:04,608
Besides, where are we gonna
get a Kryptonite key?

263
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,194
How much longer now?

264
00:21:14,194 --> 00:21:16,685
- Another ten minutes.
- Another ten minutes.

265
00:21:16,685 --> 00:21:18,892
Hey, Luthor!

266
00:21:18,892 --> 00:21:20,553
I got something to say to you!

267
00:21:20,553 --> 00:21:24,168
Security, get him out of here.

268
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:25,940
Get off me!

269
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,838
If these guys don't let me go I'm gonna lay a lawsuit
on you so fast it's gonna make your head spin.

270
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:31,862
All right, all right, I'll talk him.

271
00:21:31,862 --> 00:21:33,018
Do I know you?

272
00:21:33,018 --> 00:21:34,321
Name's Pete Ross.

273
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:36,136
Ross, Ross, Ross.

274
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:39,411
As in Ross Creamed Corn.
You stole my family's business.

275
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:42,691
Yes. I overpaid for that
ramshackle old factory.

276
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:44,721
Nobody in this town likes you!

277
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,080
Don't touch me.
You know you hate him.

278
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,300
I know that, but I value their hatred.
I find it very useful.

279
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:57,317
You see, people are always
at their weakest when they're angry.

280
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:00,732
Ask you father.

281
00:22:03,257 --> 00:22:05,928
I'll do that.

282
00:22:05,928 --> 00:22:10,280
Get him out.

283
00:22:15,528 --> 00:22:18,129
No...

284
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,433
no...

285
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:24,024
NOOO!!!

286
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:25,748
You--

287
00:22:25,748 --> 00:22:28,067
Search him. Search him.

288
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:29,865
Search me?
What are you doing?

289
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:33,089
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

290
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:35,932
Careful, Mr. Luthor.

291
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:40,633
You wouldn't want to look weak.

292
00:22:46,124 --> 00:22:48,025
Lex.

293
00:22:49,281 --> 00:22:51,569
Mr. and Mrs. Kent.

294
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:53,338
Where's the, uh, best man?

295
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:58,943
Well, you know Clark and punctuality have
never been on the best terms, but he'll be here.

296
00:22:58,943 --> 00:23:01,388
I got you something.

297
00:23:07,843 --> 00:23:09,121
A compass.

298
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,901
Yeah, it's a Kent family tradition.

299
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:13,142
My father gave me one on our wedding day,

300
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:17,108
just in case I got lost going down the aisle.

301
00:23:17,108 --> 00:23:20,090
Thank you, Mr. Kent.

302
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:30,141
Why aren't you dressed?

303
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:33,348
Wow.

304
00:23:56,329 --> 00:23:58,919
Um,

305
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,902
there's something I have to do first.

306
00:24:01,902 --> 00:24:04,006
What?

307
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:07,722
I can't tell you.

308
00:24:07,722 --> 00:24:12,191
Just know it's for us
and our future.

309
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:19,958
Last time a guy said that to me,
um, he went off to war.

310
00:24:25,177 --> 00:24:27,680
You should go.

311
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,226
I'll meet you there.

312
00:24:41,684 --> 00:24:43,998
Are you sure you're all right?

313
00:24:43,998 --> 00:24:45,979
Yeah.

314
00:24:47,732 --> 00:24:50,054
Go.

315
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:52,737
Okay.

316
00:24:57,735 --> 00:24:59,069
Lana, I--

317
00:24:59,069 --> 00:25:01,516
Yeah?

318
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:05,453
I just wanted to remember this moment.

319
00:25:42,827 --> 00:25:44,273
Any word on Clark?

320
00:25:44,273 --> 00:25:46,369
Helen's already circled
the church five times.

321
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:49,140
He was coming with Lana.

322
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,106
Lana, where's Clark?

323
00:25:55,106 --> 00:25:56,773
He said he had something to do.

324
00:25:56,773 --> 00:26:00,337
It seemed important.

325
00:26:01,724 --> 00:26:03,196
- Mr. Kent.
- I'm sorry, Lex.

326
00:26:03,196 --> 00:26:05,482
It looks like you're gonna have to start
your wedding without your best man.

327
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:06,386
We can wait.

328
00:26:06,386 --> 00:26:08,612
Hey, don't worry about Clark.

329
00:26:08,612 --> 00:26:14,434
You have far more important
things to do here. Good luck.

330
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:32,572
Hey, Clark, I'm glad I caught
you before the wedding.

331
00:26:32,572 --> 00:26:33,879
Chloe, what are you doing here?

332
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:36,355
Is everything okay? I mean,
I heard you were looking for me.

333
00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:39,947
Yeah, um, I was, but...

334
00:26:39,947 --> 00:26:41,679
I can't talk to you right now.

335
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,638
- What are you doing?
- Look, I promise I'll find you later.

336
00:26:43,638 --> 00:26:47,581
- Clark, I--
- Don't worry. I'll find you, okay?

337
00:26:47,961 --> 00:26:50,282
So how'd you decide?

338
00:26:50,282 --> 00:26:54,166
Rock-paper-scissors, coin toss, or did
you just happen to draw the short straw?

339
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:55,432
Decide?

340
00:26:55,432 --> 00:27:00,323
Who was gonna tell me that
you and Lana are together.

341
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:01,842
You know?

342
00:27:01,842 --> 00:27:06,062
Yeah. I came over to the barn the other
night to warn you about something.

343
00:27:06,062 --> 00:27:07,908
About what?

344
00:27:07,908 --> 00:27:09,331
You know, it doesn't matter now.

345
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:12,963
The point is I saw you and
Lana in a major lip lock.

346
00:27:12,963 --> 00:27:16,277
- I-I didn't mean-- 
- Didn't what, Clark?

347
00:27:16,277 --> 00:27:21,017
Newsflash. You've always
been in love with Lana.

348
00:27:21,017 --> 00:27:24,911
I tried to deny it, thinking that maybe
we could work something out, but

349
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:26,747
it's like fate, Clark.

350
00:27:26,747 --> 00:27:29,279
Inevitable, but always surprising
when it actually happens.

351
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,263
- I was gonna tell you.
- Really?

352
00:27:31,263 --> 00:27:35,288
Because obviously it was
on the top of your to-do list.

353
00:27:35,784 --> 00:27:38,478
You know, I can deal with the fact
that you guys are together.

354
00:27:38,478 --> 00:27:40,423
It hurts, but I was prepared for it.

355
00:27:40,423 --> 00:27:43,870
But we just made a promise
to be honest with each other,

356
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,807
and you didn't have the
guts to keep you word!

357
00:27:46,807 --> 00:27:47,211
Chloe--

358
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:52,160
Or was it just that it was too much fun making a
fool of me that you couldn't reveal your secret?

359
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,585
Have a nice life, Clark.

360
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,996
Mr. and Mrs. Luthor, welcome aboard.

361
00:30:27,996 --> 00:30:29,611
It'll be a couple of minutes
before we can take off.

362
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:31,625
The tower's generator just kicked in.

363
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:33,947
Seems the whole county suffered
some sort of power failure.

364
00:30:33,947 --> 00:30:38,344
Good. It'll mask our get away.

365
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:45,544
To our new life.

366
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,721
What's the matter?

367
00:31:50,721 --> 00:31:52,577
Nothing.

368
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,871
Everything's perfect.

369
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,716
How is she?

370
00:32:14,716 --> 00:32:17,717
Doctors don't know yet.

371
00:32:20,032 --> 00:32:23,330
What did you do, Clark?

372
00:32:26,164 --> 00:32:28,906
I stole Lionel's Kryptonite key.

373
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:32,430
I put it in the ship.

374
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:38,857
And why did you do that?

375
00:32:39,661 --> 00:32:43,190
Dad, I lied about the voice.

376
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:50,578
It did come back. It told me
I had to leave by noon.

377
00:32:50,578 --> 00:32:53,438
I didn't have a choice, Dad.

378
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,491
I had to destroy the ship.

379
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:59,771
Why didn't you tell us?

380
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:04,710
I knew you wouldn't
agree with what I did.

381
00:33:06,888 --> 00:33:11,979
Dad, I didn't want it to
take me away from you.

382
00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:14,158
I'm so sorry for what I did.

383
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:17,167
Your actions have consequences, Clark.

384
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:18,929
Didn't your mother and I
ever teach you that?

385
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:22,578
- Yes, but-- 
- There's no time for excuses, Clark.

386
00:33:22,578 --> 00:33:24,550
It's too late.

387
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:27,288
You didn't think this thing through.

388
00:33:27,288 --> 00:33:30,828
You had no idea what was
gonna happen, and now...

389
00:33:30,828 --> 00:33:36,334
Now your mother is lying
in a hospital bed.

390
00:33:37,156 --> 00:33:40,527
Mr. Kent?

391
00:33:47,577 --> 00:33:50,000
Doctor, how is my wife?

392
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,574
She has a mild concussion,
but she'll be fine.

393
00:33:56,215 --> 00:33:59,921
And how is our baby?

394
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:03,752
I'm sorry.

395
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:13,940
Dad....

396
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:43,002
Clark, what happened?

397
00:34:43,002 --> 00:34:46,780
Looks like a bomb went off.

398
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,361
Where are your parents?

399
00:34:49,361 --> 00:34:52,922
Hospital.

400
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,855
They're fine.

401
00:34:56,855 --> 00:35:00,057
My mom lost the baby.

402
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,050
The baby?

403
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,898
This is all my fault, Lana.
I did this.

404
00:35:06,898 --> 00:35:09,067
How could you do this?

405
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:12,059
The same way I always do.

406
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:14,724
I bring pain and suffering
to everyone's lives.

407
00:35:14,724 --> 00:35:15,813
Clark, that's not true.

408
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,992
Yes, Lana, it is.

409
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:20,708
Lana, I've kept so much from you.

410
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:24,615
If you knew the truth,
you'd never talk to me again.

411
00:35:24,615 --> 00:35:28,015
I don't believe that.

412
00:35:29,024 --> 00:35:33,775
I tried to cover up my past
and push it away.

413
00:35:33,775 --> 00:35:38,329
I-I couldn't.

414
00:35:41,543 --> 00:35:47,082
He said if I didn't go,
everyone I love would be hurt.

415
00:35:47,082 --> 00:35:50,719
He was right.

416
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,547
Clark, you're in shock.

417
00:35:52,547 --> 00:35:57,001
- You're not making any--
- No, Lana, stay from me.

418
00:35:57,001 --> 00:36:01,033
Stay away from me
before I hurt you too.

419
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:20,152
I'm glad you finally decided
to accept my offer.

420
00:36:20,152 --> 00:36:26,451
You know, don't you, you have a very
exciting future ahead of you, Miss Sullivan.

421
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:30,022
Well, opportunities like this aren't
dropped on your doorstep every day.

422
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:33,062
Why the sudden change of heart?

423
00:36:33,062 --> 00:36:35,257
You were right about Clark.

424
00:36:35,257 --> 00:36:37,197
He wasn't who I thought he was.

425
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:38,594
Oh.

426
00:36:38,594 --> 00:36:40,749
I'm surprised I hadn't noticed earlier.

427
00:36:40,749 --> 00:36:43,394
So much for my crack journalistic instinct.

428
00:36:43,394 --> 00:36:47,910
No, no, love has a way of blinding
even the sharpest minds.

429
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,355
We don't look because
we don't want to see.

430
00:36:51,355 --> 00:36:54,460
But once love has been stripped away,

431
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,567
then we see the real person clearly.

432
00:36:57,567 --> 00:37:03,728
They're revealed to us with
all their flaws, their foibles,

433
00:37:03,728 --> 00:37:07,891
and their secrets.

434
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,424
Oh, I've got a meeting.

435
00:37:11,424 --> 00:37:15,750
- I'm sorry to rush you out like this.
- It's fine.

436
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,403
Mr. Luthor?

437
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:19,973
Why are you so interested in Clark?

438
00:37:19,973 --> 00:37:25,115
You don't expect me to show
you all my cards, now do you?

439
00:37:25,115 --> 00:37:29,186
No, I guess not.

440
00:37:29,837 --> 00:37:32,651
All will be revealed in good time, Miss Sullivan.

441
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:35,489
Thank you, Mr. Luthor.

442
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:55,706
I'm here, sweetheart.

443
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,996
I'm here.

444
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:32,527
Clark. I've been looking all over for you.
I heard what happened.

445
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:34,698
What, are you here to tell me
I screwed up in some major way?

446
00:38:34,698 --> 00:38:37,683
No. Hey, listen, I'm sorry
and I want to help.

447
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:42,577
It's too late for that, Pete.
No one can help me now.

448
00:38:44,269 --> 00:38:46,148
Clark, what are you looking for?

449
00:38:46,148 --> 00:38:48,794
I know Chloe kept one of those red
Kryptonite rings around here somewhere.

450
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:50,620
Yeah, well, what do you want it for?
You know what it does to you.

451
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,736
Yeah. It makes me feel better.

452
00:38:52,736 --> 00:38:55,746
That's not the answer, Clark.

453
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,977
I saw Lana.

454
00:38:57,977 --> 00:39:01,716
I heard what happened
to your mom's baby.

455
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:03,131
Clark, you need to talk to your folks.

456
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:06,242
I did talk to my parents, Pete!

457
00:39:06,242 --> 00:39:08,640
You should have seen
the way my dad looked at me.

458
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,193
It was like I was an alien.

459
00:39:10,193 --> 00:39:15,972
If I'd have done what I should've in the
beginning, none of this would have happened.

460
00:39:26,495 --> 00:39:30,089
Clark, don't do it. When you put
that ring on, you're not yourself.

461
00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:34,279
Exactly what I don't want
to be right now, Pete.

462
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:41,882
Clark!

463
00:39:48,502 --> 00:39:51,344
Clark, where are you going?

464
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:55,426
Away from here.

465
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:57,845
The Clark Kent I know wouldn't
run away from his problems.

466
00:39:57,845 --> 00:40:00,917
The Clark Kent you know is a lie.

467
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:02,515
Why won't you let me in?

468
00:40:02,515 --> 00:40:06,443
Because, Lana, you
won't like what you see.

469
00:40:09,504 --> 00:40:13,384
- I am not giving up on you.
- No on can save me.

470
00:40:13,384 --> 00:40:14,276
Not even you.

471
00:40:14,276 --> 00:40:16,797
Your parents need you.

472
00:40:16,797 --> 00:40:20,010
I need you.

473
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:29,074
I love you, Clark.

474
00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:34,197
I love you, too...

475
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:39,261
more than you'll ever know.

476
00:40:39,261 --> 00:40:44,617
That's why I have to leave.

477
00:41:02,403 --> 00:41:05,501
Come with me.

478
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:09,992
Smallville's my home.
It's your home too.

479
00:41:09,992 --> 00:41:14,136
Not anymore.

480
00:41:44,088 --> 00:41:46,724
Helen?

481
00:41:49,756 --> 00:41:52,902
Helen?!

482
00:42:35,098 --> 00:42:39,031
You will obey me, Kal-El.
