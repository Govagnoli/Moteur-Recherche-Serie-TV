1
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,000
Very lucky tonight.

2
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,189
Sorry, Dirk.

3
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,465
- Come on!
- Who the hell are you?

4
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,929
Lucas, I'm your brother.

5
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,467
Well, come on!

6
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,704
Sure is peaceful in here
this early in the morning.

7
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,905
I never took you to be a coffee junkie...

8
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,142
...but I have the first pot brewing,
if you want to wait a sec.

9
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,616
Anything else I can get you?

10
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,657
Just a job.

11
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,319
Here?

12
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,259
If I'm gonna work,
why not do it where my friends are?

13
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,991
Don't take this the wrong way...

14
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:06,229
...but you don't have the best track record
when it comes to keeping appointments.

15
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:12,204
But talk to Hank, I hear they're hiring
over at the hardware store.

16
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,039
Ouch.

17
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,141
Guess that was kind of harsh.

18
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,581
I can put you in the running
with the other applicants.

19
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,359
No, no, no,
it's a very important vote tomorrow.

20
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:37,264
I'm not moving the day
to accommodate Dobkin's fetish...

21
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,870
...for antique clocks.

22
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:44,738
I want him back from Prague now,
Steven, do you understand me?

23
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,875
Hello, Dad.

24
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,603
Lex.

25
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:52,614
To what do I owe the pleasure
of this unexpected visit?

26
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,021
I thought you might be interested
in meeting your youngest heir.

27
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,124
Lucas, this is your father.

28
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,055
Mr. Luthor.

29
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,819
Lucas.

30
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,722
Lucas.

31
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,133
Son.

32
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,173
At least biologically speaking, right?

33
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:22,243
I see we both share a passion
for Asian weaponry.

34
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:27,210
By the placement of the dragon,
it must be worn on the right hip.

35
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,912
A rare left-handed sword.

36
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,258
But it's a fake.

37
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,819
That's a very keen observation.

38
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,192
Especially from someone
you told me was dead.

39
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:46,833
Imagine my surprise to learn that Lucas
was alive and well, living in Edge City.

40
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:50,305
Come on, Dad.
You knew he was alive.

41
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,701
Lucas?

42
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,515
Tell my secretary to take you
to the executive dining room.

43
00:06:58,684 --> 00:06:59,981
We'll join you shortly.

44
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:04,351
My chef will fix you anything
your heart desires.

45
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:12,325
Don't talk about me behind my back.

46
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,228
So the prodigal son returns.

47
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:23,432
But unlike his envious brother
in the gospel...

48
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,978
...it looks like you have welcomed Lucas
with open arms.

49
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,638
What do you expect to get out of it, Lex?

50
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,216
Just a new brother.

51
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,843
One who's just turned 18,
if I remember correctly...

52
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:39,389
...and is now entitled
to claim his inheritance.

53
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,722
It was generous of you
to set up your living trust...

54
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:46,160
...so heirs automatically get
10 percent of your LuthorCorp shares.

55
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,358
It's the vital 10 percent you need
to vote me out of power.

56
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:56,270
Is that why half my board
has suddenly found a myriad excuses...

57
00:07:56,442 --> 00:08:01,243
...for not taking my calls?
Oh, my word, you're staging a coup.

58
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,543
Careful, Lex...

59
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:13,385
...there are parables of many kinds
to be found in the Good Book.

60
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,150
Selma...

61
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,491
...get me my next call, please.

62
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,006
Working at the Talon.
Could you be any more obvious?

63
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,540
What happened to the Pete Ross rule
of proximity?

64
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,679
You wanna get in the game,
you gotta get on the court.

65
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,711
Clark, Lana will be your boss.

66
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:39,682
She's gonna take out her frustrations
for all the times you've ever let her down.

67
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,344
You won't be in the game. You'll be
in the locker room cleaning the toilets.

68
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,387
I'm probably not gonna
get the job anyway.

69
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,327
Guys...

70
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,762
...I want you to meet somebody.

71
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,561
This is Lucas. My brother.

72
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,340
What's up, guys?

73
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:06,537
- Lucas, you wanna shoot some hoops?
- Yeah, sure.

74
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,208
- Here you go.
- Come on.

75
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,872
All right.

76
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,385
Didn't mean to drop a bombshell on you.

77
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,656
I thought he was supposed to be,
well, dead.

78
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,223
Just buried by my father.

79
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,987
I've been looking for him
for several months.

80
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,456
Why didn't you say something?

81
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,423
Because I wasn't sure
what I was gonna find.

82
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,639
I've gotta straighten something out with
the bank. Lucas, we have to get going.

83
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,971
Hey, you can hang out here if you want.

84
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,512
Give me a chance to get to know him
a little bit.

85
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,479
Yeah, sure, absolutely.

86
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,979
I'll be back in an hour.

87
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,481
Here you go, Pete.

88
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,651
So you and Lex seem close.

89
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,825
What, are you kidding?
They're like brothers.

90
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,430
So, Lucas, where'd you grow up?

91
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,401
All over.

92
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,405
Must be kind of weird
not knowing your mom or your dad.

93
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:14,910
Not really. Parents always try
to make you versions of themselves.

94
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,107
Grow up without those constraints,
you can become your own person.

95
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,980
It's an interesting theory.
I don't think I buy it, though.

96
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,678
All right. Let's...

97
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,347
Let's take you and Lex, for example.

98
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,689
If he was raised by your parents
and you by Lionel...

99
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,194
...you wouldn't grow up
to be different people?

100
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,562
Trust me. You'd be rich and miserable
and he'd be wearing flannel.

101
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,703
But if you were left alone, abandoned...

102
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,869
...how do you think you'd turn out?
- I'm not sure.

103
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,002
That's when you find out
what you're really made of.

104
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:48,009
We gonna stand around and chitchat,
or are we gonna play some ball?

105
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,647
Clark, let's see what you got.

106
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,115
Check it up.

107
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,929
Is that all you got, Clark?

108
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,400
Be cool, man.

109
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,667
Hey, Rocket Man,
we don't want anybody to get hurt.

110
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,078
- All right.
- All right.

111
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,476
Come on.

112
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,932
Sorry, man, no hard feelings, right?
It's just a game.

113
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,593
Right.

114
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,997
Felt like you had a steel plate
in there or something.

115
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,804
- Any chance I can get a ride back?
- Yeah, I'll give you a lift.

116
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,854
Hello, Lana.

117
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,456
- Hey. Almond mocha with extra whip?
- Yeah.

118
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:44,927
And can you add an extra jolt of caffeine?
I'm in my postlunch-predeadline coma.

119
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,826
Thank you.

120
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,594
Katrina, could you get me an almond latte,
please, with extra whip?

121
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,300
- Clark Kent applied for part-time?
- Yeah.

122
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,239
And he didn't put me as a reference.
What's up with that?

123
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,209
- Doesn't matter, I'm not gonna hire him.
- Why not?

124
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:06,181
You work with him at the Torch,
isn't it strange supervising your friend?

125
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:10,288
Are you kidding? Bossing around Clark
is the highlight of my day.

126
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,415
Besides, he always comes through,
even if it is in his own special Clark time.

127
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:17,153
Yeah, that's kind of what
I'm worried about.

128
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,330
Lana, you and I both know
that Clark can do this job.

129
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,626
What's the real reason
you don't want him here?

130
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,030
I...

131
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,136
Yeah, that's what I thought.

132
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,842
I just spent the last two hours
at the bank.

133
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,506
Any idea why my accounts
would be frozen?

134
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:42,745
You know, Lex, I'm tired
of your constant attempts at mutiny.

135
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,823
You didn't leave me too many options.
It was that or the plank.

136
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,791
It wasn't wise of you, son,
to wager all of your assets as collateral...

137
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,590
...against LexCorp
when you took out your loan.

138
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:56,963
You see, now that your company
is a LuthorCorp property...

139
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,196
...everything you own belongs to me.

140
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,298
I want you out of the mansion.

141
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,613
Come on, Dad, isn't this a little futile?

142
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,276
Lucas and I will be back home
after we vote you out.

143
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,183
Don't be so sure about that, Lex.

144
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,122
Lucas and I had a very interesting
father and son chat.

145
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,318
Long overdue.

146
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,896
It'd be hard for you to imagine, Lex...

147
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:30,429
...but some sons don't ever question
their allegiance to family.

148
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:36,499
You're being incredibly naive
if you think you can trust him.

149
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:40,509
Something you pick up at the tables, Lex.
You size up your options.

150
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:44,343
You never know when you might
have to change your strategy midhand.

151
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,616
Well, Lex, looks like you lose.

152
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,791
I'll get it.

153
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,196
- Hey, Lex.
- Clark, I'm sorry to bother you.

154
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,097
- No problem. Is everything all right?
- No, it's not.

155
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,703
Lex, what is it?

156
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:17,415
According to my father,
I'm no longer a Luthor.

157
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,882
He's left me with nothing,
not even a place to live.

158
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,952
So I was wondering...

159
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,754
...if...

160
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,385
...I could stay with you for a while?

161
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,452
- You're up early, even for you.
- I couldn't sleep.

162
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,419
Does that have anything to do
with our new houseguest?

163
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,388
- Can you blame me?
- We can't turn our backs on Lex now.

164
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,723
Believe me, I have no intention
of turning my back on Lex now.

165
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,025
- Morning.
- Good morning.

166
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,293
- Anyone seen Lex?
- Yeah, he's out in the barn.

167
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:15,730
He got up at the crack of dawn and insisted
on doing some chores to earn his keep.

168
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,967
You got him mucking out
the stalls already?

169
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,508
Yes.

170
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,107
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

171
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,714
Yeah. Hey, son.

172
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:27,818
All kidding aside, I don't want you to forget
that he did investigate you for a year.

173
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,581
Remember what's in the storm cellar?

174
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,781
- Dad, I trust Lex.
- Clark...

175
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,155
...I don't want him left alone on this farm.

176
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,830
Well, I was gonna give you some tips...

177
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,772
...but it looks like you have everything
under control.

178
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,945
My family had a ranch in Montana.

179
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,912
I used to go there in the summer
with my mom.

180
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,311
Sounds like fun.

181
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,453
We would work right alongside
the ranch hands.

182
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,920
Everyone did their fair share.

183
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,117
It was the only time I felt... normal.

184
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:10,955
Did you ever go back?

185
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,426
After my mother died,
my father sold the property.

186
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:21,635
I guess you could say
he was never a man of the people.

187
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,999
Let me give you a hand with that.

188
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,202
Thanks, but I'd like to prove to your father
once and for all...

189
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:31,008
...that some Luthors pull their own weight.

190
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,085
Lucas?

191
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,793
We've got to talk.

192
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,032
Sure, Dad, what's up?

193
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:55,537
What's up is that you have yet to sign over
your shares to me as we'd agreed.

194
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,766
Please, turn that off.

195
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,678
Lucas, please, turn that off. Now!

196
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,011
Let's see, what's wrong
with this picture?

197
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,588
I trick Lex, I play along with your
little game, and you offer me, what...

198
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,952
...10 million dollars to walk away?

199
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,259
I'd say it's a little more lucrative
than your card scams.

200
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:23,559
Well, Dad, the deal sounded
really good at the time...

201
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:27,933
...but that is until I realized
what a Luthor goes for these days.

202
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,507
You see, I went through
the LuthorCorp financials...

203
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,702
...and it turns out I'm worth five times
what you're offering me.

204
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:37,542
And that only takes into account
what you report to Uncle Sam.

205
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,318
Don't be getting delusions of grandeur,
my boy.

206
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,054
- Tell me something, Dad.
- What?

207
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,193
Why didn't you try and find me
before I was 12?

208
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:55,727
Because your mother lied to me.
She told me you'd died as a baby.

209
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,562
But I'm still not worth your time.

210
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:01,433
I took care of you the best way
I knew how, Lucas.

211
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:07,602
- At arm's length with a checkbook.
- There are worse scenarios.

212
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,304
Lucas...

213
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:15,783
...now it's your turn to live up
to our agreement.

214
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,450
Please. Just sign.

215
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,919
Please, son.

216
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,286
Okay.

217
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,361
Okay, Dad.

218
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,908
You might want to have your lawyers
look over that.

219
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:50,450
No, I trust that everything is in order.

220
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,217
Dad.

221
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,587
Lucas?

222
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,237
What the hell are you doing?
You could have killed me.

223
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,101
We both know you saw that ball coming.

224
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:13,000
- You're way out of line, son.
- When blind man pours a drink...

225
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:16,511
...he holds his finger on the inside rim
to feel when the glass is full.

226
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,775
Yesterday, you didn't do that.

227
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:25,282
And just now, you couldn't hide
your reaction to my lack of signature.

228
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,423
What do you want, Lucas?

229
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,333
Lex is the past...

230
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,492
...I'm the future.

231
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,209
Lana, I got your message.
What's up?

232
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,680
Oh, I just wanted to let you know
that I filled that position.

233
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,650
Great.

234
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,119
- You didn't have to consult me about it.
- Yeah, I did.

235
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,521
Congratulations, Clark, you got the job.

236
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,183
Really?

237
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,723
What changed your mind?

238
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:08,263
A glowing recommendation
from the editor of the Torch.

239
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,794
- So the job's yours, if you still want it.
- Of course.

240
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,403
Are you sure about this?

241
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:17,599
No. But I remember Lex believed in me
when I wanted to start this place.

242
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:21,405
We all need someone to take a chance
on us. So when can you start?

243
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,980
Don't you think you should check
with the boss first?

244
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,120
Lana, this is Lucas, Lex's brother.

245
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:35,784
- Lex never mentioned he had a brother.
- I wasn't exactly on his Christmas card list.

246
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,988
I like the whole Egyptian/ Assyrian vibe.

247
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,996
It's clear you put a lot of time
and effort into this place.

248
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,829
Yeah, so did Lex.

249
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,498
Well, Lex, is...

250
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,266
He's not exactly in the picture anymore.

251
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,237
Lionel threw Lex out of the mansion.

252
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,307
How's he doing down on the farm, Clark?

253
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,036
He's doing great.

254
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:58,580
- He's a survivor.
- I hope that he can survive on nothing...

255
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,311
...because anything that was his
is now mine.

256
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,478
Including this place.

257
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,659
You should know that Lex wasn't my boss,
he was my partner.

258
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,390
Even better.

259
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:34,949
- Hey. I didn't know the Talon delivered.
- I decided to make an exception.

260
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,610
I assume you got the job, then.

261
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:40,019
Apparently, the editor of the Torch
put me over the top.

262
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,486
So how does it feel
to be a minimum-wage earner?

263
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:43,889
Great.

264
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,860
Though there seems to be some
personnel changes at the Talon.

265
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,296
Are you talking about Lucas Luthor?

266
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,259
Yeah, how'd you know?

267
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,734
Are you kidding?
The prodigal Luthor son returns.

268
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:56,840
And to top it all off,
the new heir has taken over the castle.

269
00:22:57,008 --> 00:23:00,944
That's a story that could land you a byline
on the front page of the Daily Planet.

270
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:04,446
I just... I don't trust Lucas.
I think he's hiding something.

271
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:07,346
Come on. Cut the guy a break.
He's had a really tough life.

272
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,488
He bounced from foster home
to foster home. He never got adopted.

273
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:14,113
When you were looking at his past,
you didn't find anything weird at all?

274
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,192
Just the source.

275
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,897
"Metropolis United Charities."

276
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,062
Chloe said Lucas' file didn't even exist
two weeks ago. Suddenly, there it is.

277
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,969
Like somebody wanted him to be found.

278
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,202
The detectives I hired didn't say
where they got their information.

279
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,472
- Think your father knew about Lucas?
- Do you even have to ask?

280
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:41,176
- Lucas was in on this from the beginning.
- Why would he suddenly let you find him?

281
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:45,255
Because ever since he took LexCorp, he
knows I've been looking to get back at him.

282
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,551
He co-opted Lucas before I could.

283
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:51,423
While I've been playing checkers,
my father's been playing chess.

284
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,033
Wow.

285
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,081
Say, I love what you've done
with the place.

286
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:16,016
Is this your newest scam?
Corporate titan in training?

287
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,784
Unlike you, Lex,
I don't live in my father's shadow.

288
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,759
My training's over.

289
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,092
What can I do for you?

290
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,065
Feeling pretty good about yourself
right now, aren't you?

291
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:35,365
I got to admit,
you and my father played me brilliantly.

292
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,636
Just out of idle curiosity,
when did he contact you?

293
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,678
Three weeks ago.
He told me who he was...

294
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:47,911
...said you were looking for me,
wanted to use me for some corporate raid.

295
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,251
Let's face it, Lex...

296
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,352
...I'm the son he wants.

297
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:01,659
Careful, Lucas, you're showing your hand.

298
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:06,336
Come on, what is it you're really after?

299
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,568
His affection?

300
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:12,842
Do you really believe if you stick around
he's gonna love you?

301
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,975
Trust me, you don't know him at all.

302
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,477
Get out, Lex. You lost.

303
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,056
I found you because he wanted me to.

304
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:36,633
- High school kids can track you down.
- You mean your friend Clark Kent.

305
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,194
I bet a lot of people are out
looking for you.

306
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:46,868
- Like your friends from Edge City.
- Oh, wow, Lex. Is that a threat?

307
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,503
You know, Lucas,
the Luthor gene pool is a shark tank...

308
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,879
...and our father's
just chummed the waters.

309
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,746
Good luck.

310
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,726
There you go.

311
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,331
- Where's Clark?
- Good question.

312
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,632
Lana! Sorry I'm late.

313
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:19,504
Don't worry about it. You can make it up
by taking these lattes to table three.

314
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:24,311
- I want you to fire him.
- Fire me? For what?

315
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:28,213
You're half an hour late to work. Were you
helping Lex dig up more dirt about me?

316
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:31,082
Lucas, I am not gonna fire Clark.

317
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,985
Okay, then I'll fire you too.

318
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:36,491
Check our partnership agreement.
You can't do that. Lex made sure of it.

319
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:44,065
Lex is history, and so is this place.
You can count on it.

320
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:53,168
- Lucas, wait. You can't do this!
- I'm a Luthor. I can do anything I want.

321
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:56,439
If you want me to quit, I will,
just leave Lana alone!

322
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,073
Too late.

323
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:54,735
You okay?

324
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,990
- Dad.
- Lucas.

325
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,429
I heard about last night.

326
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,770
Well, you know, you wouldn't be a Luthor
if somebody wasn't trying to kill you.

327
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,507
It didn't hurt that Clark Kent was there.

328
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,407
I don't know how he reacted so quickly.

329
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:39,706
Well, Clark is a very special young man.

330
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,344
Did you recognize the shooter?

331
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:48,356
His name's Dirk. I did some business
with him back in Edge City.

332
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:50,653
Interesting euphemism.

333
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,486
You don't sound too surprised.

334
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:57,328
Where do you think you are, Walton
Mountain? Come on, Lucas, think a minute.

335
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:01,529
You walk in here, you take everything
that belongs to Lex.

336
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,568
You think he's just gonna give up
without a fight?

337
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:09,737
You know, that's funny because Lex said
that you wanted me out of the picture.

338
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,773
Of course he did.

339
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,442
But you're my son.

340
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,648
Why should I believe you, Dad?

341
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,348
Lucas.

342
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,960
- Look...
- You wanted me out of your life.

343
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,161
You even tried to buy me off.

344
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,458
Why the sudden change of heart?

345
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:36,799
It was a test.
But you stood up to me...

346
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:40,411
...turned the tables,
showed me your strength.

347
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:42,910
That's what it takes to win.

348
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:46,145
Lex doesn't have that.

349
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,518
Why do you think he's afraid of you?

350
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,325
You've thrown down the gauntlet, Lucas.

351
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,895
You willing to go the distance?

352
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,092
Lex obviously is.

353
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:11,334
- Hey, Clark.
- Chloe, what'd you find out?

354
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:15,468
So they caught Lucas' shooter
outside of Metropolis. His name is Dirk Lee.

355
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,343
They tracked him down
with the license plate you gave them.

356
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:21,713
- Did he tell the police who tipped him off?
- Not exactly.

357
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:25,287
Somewhere between the booking desk
and a holding cell, Dirk mysteriously...

358
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,822
...keeled over and died.

359
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,120
Someone didn't want him to talk.

360
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:33,787
Yeah, someone who had enough power
to kill him in a police station.

361
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,627
- You have anyone that comes to mind?
- Cover for me, okay?

362
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:41,204
No, Clark. I drink coffee,
I do not serve it. Clark!

363
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,471
Mr. Kent.

364
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:59,183
I wanted to say thank you for everything
you and your family have done for me.

365
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,582
What, you going somewhere, Lex?

366
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,484
Well, I need to talk to my brother...

367
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:08,098
...and you know what they say about fish
and houseguests after three days.

368
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,368
You're welcome back anytime.

369
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,172
That's nice of you to say.

370
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:22,177
Look, I gave you every single
crappy farm job I could think of.

371
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,145
But you did them all,
you didn't complain, not once.

372
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,842
You would have made
one hell of a farmer.

373
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,587
Thanks, Mr. Kent.

374
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,614
Sure.

375
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:42,364
- Lucas, what are you doing?
- Finishing what you started.

376
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:51,072
- Who is that?
- It's Clark Kent.

377
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,301
Clark. Oh, Clark.

378
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:57,676
I'm sorry, I meant to call and thank you
for saving Lucas.

379
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:03,317
Your rescues are becoming
a bit of a Luthor family tradition.

380
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,586
I understand they caught the shooter
in Metropolis.

381
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,488
Yes, I heard that.

382
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:14,658
So I can assume you've also heard
that he died while in police custody?

383
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,129
That's unfortunate...

384
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,529
...but it happens.

385
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,605
It's just awfully convenient, isn't it?

386
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,743
Kind of like how Lex was able
to track down Lucas.

387
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,141
I think you've inherited
your father's paranoia.

388
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:32,841
We're not talking about my family,
Mr. Luthor. We're talking about yours.

389
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:37,979
Good night, Clark.

390
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,694
Send my regards to your mother.

391
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,860
Yeah.

392
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,095
What?

393
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,000
Lucas, where are you?

394
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:06,106
All right, all right, I'll take the chopper.
Be there in half an hour, my office.

395
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:09,879
Don't do anything rash,
you understand me?

396
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,022
Lucas?

397
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,622
Glad you could make it.

398
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,228
What the hell are you doing?

399
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:27,530
Come on, Dad.
This is exactly what you wanted.

400
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:32,771
Pitted us against each other, and we
played in your Cain and Abel fantasy.

401
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:39,480
You put the gun down, Lucas.
Put it down.

402
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:44,714
How do you know he's got a gun?

403
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,996
You twisted son of a bitch!

404
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,935
You're the one who told me
to finish what I started.

405
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:07,100
Well, as long as Lex is around, I'll always
have to fight for my place in this family.

406
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,770
Lucas, you are not going
to shoot your brother.

407
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:13,606
You're right.

408
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,448
You are.

409
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:28,864
What do you expect to achieve, Lucas?
Tell me.

410
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:31,866
Isn't it obvious, Dad?
Once we're both out of the picture...

411
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:35,437
...young Lucas here inherits everything.
- Pull the trigger.

412
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:54,684
Lucas, think. Just think, Lucas.

413
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,457
Think this through.
I'm not your enemy, Lucas.

414
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:01,223
I'm not the one who deliberately
kept you in foster care.

415
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,766
- You're not helping things, Lex.
- Ever wonder why you were never adopted?

416
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,962
If you were in trouble, how you
got bailed out at the last minute?

417
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,630
Don't tell me you thought
you were just lucky.

418
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:14,266
We're a social experiment. One son
gets everything, the other gets nothing.

419
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,039
That's ludicrous.
I would never do that.

420
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,150
You would.
Just like you tipped off the shooter.

421
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:24,220
Your friend Dirk was on our father's payroll.
Edge City was a setup.

422
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:28,051
- You wanted to use me too.
- Yes, I did and for that I am truly sorry.

423
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:32,094
But trust me, trying to gain
his love and respect is not worth it.

424
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,532
Is it true?
Is that what you did to me?

425
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:38,729
We've got a lot to talk about, son.

426
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,564
After you kill Lex.

427
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:45,438
For once, I want the blood
to be on your hands.

428
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:51,909
Time's up, Dad.

429
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:08,096
- No. I can't do it.
- Well, that's just too bad.

430
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:12,532
Lucas, please, don't.
I will not kill my son.

431
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,242
Psychotic little bastard!

432
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,577
It must be in the genes.

433
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,024
It's blanks.

434
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,234
This one too.

435
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,304
Checkmate.

436
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,556
Come on, Lucas.

437
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,957
- Good night.
- Thanks.

438
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:52,293
Lana. I realize you're locking up,
but I just need to explain.

439
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,667
It's not necessary. I understand.

440
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,807
- You're not mad.
- Somehow, when you let people down...

441
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:02,468
...you make it really hard for them
to be mad at you.

442
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,576
- Lana, I just...
- Clark, it isn't you...

443
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:11,917
So I guess that's it.

444
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,925
The shortest career in the history
of the coffeehouse business.

445
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:20,792
Second shortest.
Don't forget my one day at the Beanery.

446
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,930
Hope this doesn't change things
between us.

447
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:33,475
I don't see how things are ever
gonna change between us, Clark.

448
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:04,874
- That can stay.
- Yes, sir.

449
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,335
Lex.

450
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:16,244
Glad to see that you're making yourself
at home again, son.

451
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,715
I read your fascinating piece of fiction
in the Daily Planet.

452
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,793
People love to read about triumph
over adversity.

453
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,924
And your stock jumped five points.

454
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,766
How long have you been able to see?

455
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,936
Few weeks.

456
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,645
Playing the handicapped card is low,
even for you.

457
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:49,809
But I was able to see more clearly
than ever.

458
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:54,356
It's amazing what people try and get
away with right in front of your eyes...

459
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,993
...when they think you can't see.

460
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,591
I can only imagine.

461
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,726
All right, Lex.

462
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:14,672
How are we gonna repair
this rift between us?

463
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:23,014
You mean, how are you gonna
keep the whole Lucas affair quiet?

464
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:34,227
I was thinking
of giving you LexCorp back.

465
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:37,890
- Majority stake, no strings attached.
- Except for my silence.

466
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:42,694
I've always believed that family business
should be kept within the family.

467
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:46,333
And Lucas is under my protection now.

468
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:03,418
You remember the fable of the frog
and the scorpion, Lex?

469
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,355
Yeah, Dad.

470
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,800
The frog helped the scorpion
across the river.

471
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:15,461
The scorpion repaid his kindness
by stinging the frog.

472
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,073
"Why did you do it?"
The dying frog asked him.

473
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,609
And the scorpion replied,
"Because it is my nature."

474
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:25,212
Believe me, Lex,
your brother will never change.

475
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,475
I've watched him over the years.
The boy's a sociopath.

476
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,754
And I wonder which side of the family tree
he got that from.

477
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:41,464
Good night, Dad.
I'll be sure to give Lucas your love.

478
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:01,549
My mom told me you were gonna
come back and get the rest of your stuff.

479
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,413
Surprisingly, my dad's had
a change of heart.

480
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:08,183
Sorry Lucas didn't turn out to be
the brother you wanted.

481
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:11,919
Considering his father,
I'm surprised he's still alive at all.

482
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,459
Where is Lucas now?

483
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,589
Safe.

484
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,065
But I'm gonna have some work to do
to regain his trust.

485
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,632
You will. You're not your father.

486
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:28,339
Sometimes, Clark, we're all held hostage
by the will of our fathers.

487
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,312
The only difference is,
your dad's a good man.

488
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,973
All my father does is push people away.

489
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:37,783
Your dad opened his home to me,
no questions asked.

490
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:45,124
As long as I live, I don't think
I'm ever gonna understand your family.

491
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,763
Neither will I.

492
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,262
Just remember...

493
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,466
...my father may try and rule the world...

494
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,602
...but yours will inherit the earth.
