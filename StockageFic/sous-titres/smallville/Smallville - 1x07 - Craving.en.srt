1
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,400
You know, if you're not in the mood
for my spaghetti...

2
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,400
...we could always order in Thai.

3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,200
No spaghetti, no Thai.

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,120
I wanna look good for
Lana's birthday party.

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,440
I just think that maybe you're focusing
a little too hard on this one party.

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,640
It's not just the party, it's everything.
It's...

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,720
Nobody likes me.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,600
And why should they? I'm a cow.

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,160
But, I've got a new plan.

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,920
From now on, no more food. Just this.

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,120
Cutting the heads off supermodels.
It's kind of redundant, isn't it?

12
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,760
Just looking for outfit ideas.

13
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,200
I still don't have anything to wear
to Lana's party.

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,600
What's up?

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,960
Pete and I were hoping you could
give us a quick algebra download.

16
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,640
I thought Clark usually helps you guys.

17
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,320
He's a little preoccupied
helping the birthday girl.

18
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,320
We'll even buy you lunch.

19
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,760
That looks... appetizing.

20
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,720
Losing weight is never pretty.

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,960
Ross, we're getting a game together.

22
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,680
Do you want in, or do you want
to keep whale-watching?

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,320
Dustin, back off.

24
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,920
Chill out, cool guy. I didn't know
you were a chubby-chaser.

25
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,920
- Jodi, wait.
- Oh, man.

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,800
You'd think someone that big
would have a thicker skin.

27
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,920
You'd think someone that stupid
would have a thicker head.

28
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,160
Jodi, we talked about this.
Starving yourself isn't the way.

29
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,480
I'm tired of waiting.

30
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,080
Waiting and weighing and keeping
a diary of everything that I eat...

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,800
...so that I can feel guilty
if I have one extra grape.

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,200
I understand all of that, but you can't
just stop eating. It's not healthy.

33
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,840
Honey, you're beautiful already.

34
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,440
Just like your mother.

35
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,000
No, Dad. I'm not.

36
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,960
Mom wasn't fat.

37
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,720
Craving

38
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,520
Okay, that's enough.

39
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,720
Done already?

40
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,040
Your heart can go on
like that forever.

41
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,320
Good.

42
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,400
I don't want to go through
this physical nonsense for five years.

43
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, let's hope not.

44
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,320
There is one thing I need
to talk to you about.

45
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,520
Your blood work came in. You have
an unusually elevated white-cell count.

46
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,160
What, like leukemia?

47
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,000
That's not likely. I don't get sick.

48
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,600
- Are you on any medication?
- Nope.

49
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,240
- Do you have any allergies?
- No.

50
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,120
Childhood illness?

51
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,360
- Asthma.
- When did that stop?

52
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,360
The day I lost my hair.
Is this going somewhere?

53
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,600
If this were anywhere else,
I'd order a battery of tests.

54
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,680
But I do see a lot of this in Smallville.

55
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
Why should Smallville be any different?

56
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,360
Some say it's because the LuthorCorp
plant has contaminated the environment.

57
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,600
I very much doubt that.

58
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,400
Let's order those tests.

59
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,080
Now, I want this to be special.

60
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,600
What do you think about
a three-tier birthday cake?

61
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,560
Thanks for the lifeline.

62
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,720
It's a math midterm. I didn't pull you
out of a burning building.

63
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,120
- I still appreciate it.
- Lana?

64
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,480
I wanted to get your opinion
on the balloons.

65
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,880
Now, I think white always looks good.

66
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,000
- Works for me.
- Okay.

67
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,280
This whole birthday extravaganza
has been pretty distracting.

68
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,760
Having a birthday party at Lex's mansion
seems pretty cool to me.

69
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,520
It stopped being my party
a long time ago.

70
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,000
If it was up to me, it would be pizza
and loud music with my friends.

71
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,040
Did you tell Nell that?

72
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,480
We've been through a lot the past few
months. I figure I should give her this.

73
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,640
Lana, guess what.

74
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,840
The scout called!

75
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,920
- I got the tryout with Kansas State.
- That's incredible!

76
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,440
Hey, congrats.

77
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,200
I haven't said yes yet.

78
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,680
They want me there on Saturday,
your big night.

79
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,200
It's Nell's big night. I was just
telling Clark it wasn't important.

80
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,760
Yeah, Scout's honour.

81
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,000
I want you to go.

82
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,800
Hey, I'll catch up with you guys later.

83
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,280
Clark, I'm telling you,
this is good news for you.

84
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,360
Kansas State gives Whitney a scholarship
and Lana gives him a tongue bath.

85
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,560
How is that good news?

86
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,320
Even I'm having a hard time
following this skewed logic.

87
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,800
Lana's going to be dateless
for her own party.

88
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,400
Hi, Pete.

89
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,640
Jodi?

90
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,840
You look...

91
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,400
Thinner?

92
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,640
I was still looking for a euphemism,
but, yeah.

93
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,240
- Are you okay?
- Never better.

94
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,320
My diet's just starting to pay off.
Bought some new clothes.

95
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,440
You look great.

96
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,640
Thank you for sticking up
for me yesterday.

97
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,840
Most people wouldn't have done that.

98
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Most people can't stand Dustin.

99
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,600
Yeah.

100
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,200
Listen. I was wondering,
do you have a date for Lana's party?

101
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,920
No, he's still free.

102
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,200
Would you like to go with me?

103
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,760
He'd love to.

104
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,720
Great. Okay, well, I'll see you later.

105
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,280
Bye.

106
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,680
I don't get it.

107
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,040
Women dig me. Get used to it.

108
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,440
No, I mean Jodi. It's like
she lost that weight overnight.

109
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,360
If she could do that, half the school
would be after that secret. Come on.

110
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,240
Let's go.

111
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,560
- Hello.
- Lana, hi. Come in.

112
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,120
Hey.

113
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,320
Lana, can I interest you in a latte?

114
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,560
I'll pass. Bad waitressing flashbacks.

115
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,920
I brought over the produce order
for the party.

116
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,440
- You could have called it in.
- And miss a chance to leave the house?

117
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,080
Nell's planning this party
like a royal wedding.

118
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
Oh, yeah, I can tell.

119
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,240
Dad, I got the posts in the west field.

120
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,920
I hit some granite,
but I jammed it through.

121
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,960
Very impressive.

122
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,760
I had a sledgehammer.

123
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,920
Somebody's gotta work around here.

124
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,000
Thought you'd be posing
for ice sculptures by now.

125
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,800
I'm hiding out.

126
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,440
You have my sympathies.
Whitney's not even here for backup.

127
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,640
I know. I contemplated stowing away
in the back of his truck on Saturday.

128
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,680
A no-show at your own party.
That would keep the town talking.

129
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,520
I wouldn't do that to Nell.

130
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,640
It's just, all this attention
is a little unnerving.

131
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,040
Well, if you like,
I could be your escort on Saturday.

132
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,960
You know, so I can fend off
the throngs of adoring fans.

133
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,080
- I'd like that.
- Great.

134
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,520
I better go.

135
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,360
If I'm away too long, Nell will
probably send out a search party.

136
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,640
And Clark...

137
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,760
Promise me you'll make it this time.

138
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,880
I promise.

139
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,720
- Thanks.
- Bye.

140
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,520
Escort to fend off the adoring fans?

141
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,680
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing, Clark.

142
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,360
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

143
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,080
Mom, Lana and I are just friends.

144
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,920
Okay.

145
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,840
I'm officially butting out.

146
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,200
So, what are you gonna get her
for her birthday?

147
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,800
I don't know.

148
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,040
Any ideas?

149
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,680
My mother always said the best gifts
come from the heart.

150
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,520
Jodi, you feeling okay?
You look a little...

151
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,040
Yeah, don't worry, Dad,
I'm feeling great.

152
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,720
I even got a date for Lana's party.

153
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,120
Jodi, that's terrific.

154
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,440
But I want you to eat something more
than those shake things, all right?

155
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,720
You know what? I will.

156
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,120
I'm done counting calories.

157
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,760
I've gotta go.

158
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,360
- Don't stay up too late.
- Okay.

159
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,840
Bye!

160
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,320
Getting your morning Lana fix?

161
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,800
Chloe, don't you ever knock?

162
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,280
It's a barn, Clark.

163
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,800
Is there a reason you're here early,
or do you just enjoy busting my chops?

164
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,040
A little of both.

165
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,600
Did you hear about the accident last
night? A deer was hit out on Route 5.

166
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,560
- Not exactly "Wall of Weird" material.
- Check out the paper.

167
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,960
Animal Control said that
the deer died of causes unknown.

168
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,440
So?

169
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,680
Not much unknown about
a bumper at 60 miles per hour.

170
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,120
I'd love to run down theories with you,
but I've got chores to do.

171
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,960
And I still haven't figured out
what to get Lana for her birthday.

172
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,040
Well, you or your family knows
people at Animal Control, right?

173
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,760
One perk of growing up on a farm.

174
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,000
I was thinking we could
stop by before school.

175
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,520
You could use your pull,
take a couple of pictures.

176
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,040
I'll help you out with
your gift-giving dilemma.

177
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,240
Okay, but I want it to be
something unique.

178
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,280
Just don't make it as unique
as what you gave me last year.

179
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,640
Very impressive use of pull:
"Can I use your bathroom?"

180
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,000
I can't believe
we're looking for road kill.

181
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,360
The deer's in there.

182
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,840
The door's locked.

183
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,120
I'm gonna go find a maintenance worker.

184
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,440
Chloe, it's open.

185
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,000
How'd you do that?

186
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,800
Kent charm.

187
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,160
Lift it up. Go.

188
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,520
Looks like jerky.

189
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,480
The lab report says the deer lost
something like 80 percent of its fat.

190
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,640
It's like it's been liposuctioned to death.

191
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,080
What do you think it is?
Some fat-sucking vampire in town?

192
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,360
This is Smallville, Clark.
Land of the weird, home of the strange.

193
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,520
Jodi, honey, are you...?
Are you okay in there?

194
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,480
Yeah, Dad, I'm fine.

195
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,880
Well, I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

196
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,920
I've gotta go to Metropolis for a few
days or I'm going to lose this client.

197
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,920
When will you be back?

198
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,200
Not till Sunday morning, which means
I'm gonna miss your big date.

199
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,280
It's okay, it's no big deal.

200
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,560
Well, do you think maybe
I could see you before I leave?

201
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,920
I'm kind of indecent at the moment.

202
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,000
Honey, I think that maybe
we need to talk to somebody.

203
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,200
I don't need a shrink.

204
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,960
I just want you to look in a mirror
and be happy.

205
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,120
Daddy, I am.

206
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,080
Most of my friends are trying
to get out of high school.

207
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,040
I was meeting with your principal.

208
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,920
Apparently, you guys are
in dire need of a new computer lab.

209
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,440
I figured I could help.

210
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,680
They might even
name a lunch special after you.

211
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,160
- How'd you end up here?
- My plant manager, Gabe.

212
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,000
He's always going on about his
daughter, the reporter on the Torch.

213
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,960
Thought I'd drop by and say hello.

214
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,520
- She's not here, but I was struck by this.
- That's Chloe's hobby.

215
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,440
She thinks she can trace all the freak
things here to the meteor shower.

216
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,440
Interesting theory.

217
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,880
Most people think it's crazy.

218
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,480
Maybe.

219
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,040
Do you remember where you were
when they fell?

220
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,360
Not really.

221
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,960
- My parents hadn't adopted me yet.
- I do.

222
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,040
I was right here in Smallville.

223
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,520
My mother wanted me to spend
some quality time with my dad.

224
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,040
He brought me here on a business trip.

225
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,760
Just a quick hop to Smallville
to finalize a deal.

226
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,000
Funny how one day
can change your whole life.

227
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,200
What happened?

228
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,400
I was out in a corn field
when the first meteor hit.

229
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,480
It was like a tidal wave coming at me.

230
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
Then everything went black.

231
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,440
Next thing I remember, I was waking up
in Metropolis General completely bald.

232
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,680
Lex, I didn't know.

233
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,720
Not many people do, Clark.

234
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,800
I should have died that day.
Instead, I walked away with this.

235
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,160
- I'm sorry.
- Why? It's not your fault.

236
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,240
When I was younger,
I thought it was a curse.

237
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,560
Kids figured I was a freak or on chemo.

238
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,640
Then I began to see it as my gift.

239
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,360
The thing that defined me,
that gave me strength.

240
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,000
You ever wonder what you'd be like?

241
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
You know, if you hadn't come that day?

242
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,800
It doesn't matter, Clark. It happened.

243
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,520
Personally, I think my future's
gonna be brighter...

244
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,920
...than that spoiled rich brat
that walked into that corn field.

245
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,240
Mr. Luthor.

246
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,080
It's Lex.

247
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,080
Clark was just telling me
your meteor theory. I like it.

248
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,240
Thanks.

249
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,360
Especially since most people think
my company's behind everything...

250
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,680
...that goes wrong in Smallville.
- That's the reigning theory.

251
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,600
Are you the only one
that blames the meteors instead of me?

252
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,040
Pretty much. Well, there is Mr. Hamilton.

253
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,760
Most don't have high regard for a guy
who sells plastic meteor chips to tourists.

254
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,520
Doesn't exactly inspire confidence.

255
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Call me when you need a summer
job. I've got friends at the Inquisitor.

256
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,440
I'll see you tomorrow.

257
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,480
I hear you're escorting
the birthday girl. Nice work.

258
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,560
We're just going as friends.

259
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,480
Sure you are. Hope you got her
a nice gift.

260
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,800
Yeah.

261
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,920
Jodi, I didn't see you in class.
Are you okay?

262
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,080
Yeah, I'm fine, just stomach flu.
I can't keep anything down.

263
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,520
- Maybe you should go see the nurse.
- I've got it under control.

264
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,720
Are you sure you're okay?

265
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,120
I'm fine. I just need to rest up
for tomorrow night.

266
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,280
Look.

267
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,920
If you don't feel up to it, I'll understand.

268
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,040
Are you kidding?

269
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,360
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

270
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,840
Hey, Jodi. I've been watching you.

271
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,720
I bet you have.

272
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,600
Hitting the gym was a good idea.

273
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
You should take your own advice.

274
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,480
Whoa. You all right?

275
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,400
I'm just a little hungry.

276
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,880
You like what you see?

277
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,000
Totally.

278
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,160
I'll bet you wouldn't mind seeing
a little bit more, would you?

279
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,640
Follow me.

280
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,480
- Confederacy of Dunces.
- First edition.

281
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,760
- Early birthday gift?
- From Whitney. I couldn't believe it.

282
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,560
It's a cool gift.

283
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,720
That's the thing with Whitney. At times
I think he's a million miles away...

284
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,080
...and then he surprises me
with something like this.

285
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,160
- How are things on the party front?
- I surrendered.

286
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,000
I told Nell to make
the final decisions without me.

287
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,200
I cannot believe how anti-birthday
you are.

288
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,800
- Haven't you ever had a happy birthday?
- Once.

289
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,920
Went to a drive-in.

290
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,960
- That doesn't sound like Nell's style.
- I was with my parents.

291
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,560
My dad pulled the car up to the front row
so the screen filled the entire windshield.

292
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,120
I remember feeling all grown up because
I got to sit in the front seat with them.

293
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,040
They played Bugs Bunny cartoons
before the movie started.

294
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,840
I was cold, so my mom
wrapped me up in her sweater.

295
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,120
That sounds nice.

296
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,000
I fell asleep before the movie
even started...

297
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,120
...between my mom and dad.

298
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,000
It's the last time I can remember
feeling completely safe.

299
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,960
That's a great memory.

300
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,440
Hey.

301
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,120
- We're fine. No one's gonna see us.
- Good.

302
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,320
You don't think I ever meant that stuff
I said about you when you were...?

303
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,880
Fat?

304
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,760
You thought it was funny...

305
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,360
...calling me names, making me cry...

306
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,880
...making me wish
that I were dead rather than fat.

307
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,160
- Well, what can I say?
- You can say you're sorry.

308
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,440
Help me.

309
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,360
Don't touch that.

310
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
You're not sterile and you're not me.

311
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,880
My apologies, Dr. Hamilton.

312
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,440
You don't have a website, do you?

313
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,800
Excuse me?

314
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,640
They're usually the ones who track
me down. The freaks with websites.

315
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,040
I'm just a fan.

316
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,760
Lex Luthor.

317
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,760
The billionaire's son.

318
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,880
Mineralogists don't have fans.

319
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,680
Most mineralogists didn't handle
the first Apollo moon rocks.

320
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,520
That was a lifetime ago
when I was a respectable scientist.

321
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,800
You know, we may have
a few things in common.

322
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,160
I was kicked out
of Metropolis University too.

323
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,840
Ever since I found out about
a medical condition I have...

324
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,640
...I've become very interested
in your work, Dr. Hamilton.

325
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,800
And you think it has
something to do with the meteors.

326
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,080
Isn't that your theory? The meteors
somehow alter cellular makeup?

327
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,480
That sounds to me
like research worth funding.

328
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,880
Yes, well, sorry. My funding is private,
and so are my results.

329
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,960
Your funding comes from tourists.

330
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,240
If you are so interested in meteors,
here, take one.

331
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,880
Enjoy it. I have nothing else for sale.

332
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,360
When you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

333
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,000
I called the hospital. Dustin's in a coma.

334
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,760
His body went into shock with the loss
of fat. He hasn't told the cops anything.

335
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,200
Time to revisit
the fat-sucking vampire theory.

336
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,600
You know, if you hadn't been there,
he probably would have died, Clark.

337
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,560
I can't figure out why anybody
would want to steal body fat.

338
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,280
I know. It takes eating disorders
to a whole new level.

339
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,720
Jodi.

340
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,520
- Hi, guys, what's up?
- Study group, remember?

341
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,360
Totally slipped my mind.

342
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,200
So no more veggie shakes, huh?

343
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,240
Are you feeling okay?
Pete said you felt sick yesterday.

344
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,240
Oh, that.

345
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,360
I'm fully recovered.

346
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,560
I guess it's safe to say
that the diet's finally over.

347
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,640
I'm starving.
I haven't eaten anything all day.

348
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,720
I'm just a little nervous
about the party tonight.

349
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,120
Yeah.

350
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,360
I'll see you guys tonight.

351
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,640
- Okay, what was that about?
- I don't know.

352
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,080
- I gotta fly. We'll talk about this later?
- Okay.

353
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,560
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm still working on Lana's birthday gift.

354
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,840
Any hints?

355
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,920
Yeah. It's not a gift certificate.

356
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,280
What do you think?

357
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,600
- It's really...
- Not you at all.

358
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,000
I heard the quarterback
couldn't make it. Too bad.

359
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,440
I knew you'd be devastated.

360
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,560
Whitney's trying out for a football
scholarship to Kansas State.

361
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,960
He didn't think he made the cut,
but someone fell out.

362
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,480
I know.

363
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,160
Your aunt told me.

364
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,600
I like your new escort better.

365
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,600
Have fun tonight.

366
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,960
- Mom, you almost done?
- Relax, Clark.

367
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,240
You're not going to be late for once.

368
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,320
By the way, did you figure out
what to get Lana?

369
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,160
Yeah, Lex helped me out.

370
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,040
So, what is it?

371
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,840
I thought you were butting out of this.

372
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,920
Then you better learn how to iron.

373
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,160
- Hi, Chloe.
- Hi, Mrs. Kent.

374
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,200
- You've gotta take a look at this.
- Why aren't you dressed?

375
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,520
I didn't have time. You really,
really need to check this out.

376
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,000
"Smallville Body and Fender.
Replace windshield, replace side-panels.

377
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,920
- Cause of accident, impact with deer"?
- It was Jodi's car, Clark.

378
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,440
- What do you think happened to her?
- Her house is next to a big meteor hit.

379
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,720
She lost all that weight...

380
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,840
...by drinking juice from vegetables
grown in her greenhouse.

381
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,440
She's losing weight too fast
to keep up with regular food.

382
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,800
- And that's why she needs body fat.
- Exactly.

383
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,800
We need to find her.

384
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,440
Jodi wouldn't let anything keep her
from getting to that party.

385
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,520
Pete.

386
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,040
Perfect.

387
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,920
- Hi.
- Hi.

388
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,640
Perfect flowers for a perfect date.

389
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,640
They're beautiful, Pete.

390
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,080
So is that dress.

391
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,720
Thanks. It was my mom's.

392
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,360
Is something wrong?

393
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,040
I'm fine. I just need to eat.

394
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,760
That doesn't sound right.
Maybe we should go to the hospital.

395
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,440
You've always been good to me, Pete.

396
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,880
- Please go away now.
- Jodi.

397
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,920
Go away.

398
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,360
Jodi, wait!

399
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,040
Jodi!

400
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,360
Jodi, come on!

401
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,280
Jodi.

402
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,080
Jodi?

403
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,120
Jodi, where are you?

404
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,800
Pete, please get away.

405
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,560
- It's all my fault.
- Jodi?

406
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,240
I just wanted to be thin.
There's only so much a person can take.

407
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,480
Pete, please go home.

408
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,000
Come on, Jodi, you don't have to hide.

409
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,760
I don't wanna hurt you.

410
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,240
Come on, Jodi, you couldn't hurt a...

411
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,800
Just tell me what's happening.

412
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,600
Please leave.

413
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,400
Jodi?

414
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,800
Pete!

415
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,120
Pete, are you okay?
Pete, what's wrong?

416
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,160
Jodi!

417
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,320
- Why can't you just leave me alone?
- You're sick.

418
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,640
Whatever you did to yourself,
you can get help.

419
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,880
All I wanted was to be thin.

420
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,600
Jodi, this isn't you.

421
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,360
What, isn't this
what I'm supposed to look like?

422
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,120
Look at me. I'm a freak.

423
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,880
I know how to stop this for good.

424
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,880
Wait!

425
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,040
Jodi?

426
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,800
Pete! Get over here, quick!

427
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,560
Clark?

428
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,760
Is she okay?

429
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,200
I think so, but we need
to get her to a hospital.

430
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,240
Sneaking out, huh?

431
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,680
Isn't this your shindig?

432
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,680
- Says so on all the invitations.
- Right.

433
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,120
You're not hiding,
you're getting some air.

434
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,040
I spent 18 years of Luthor
Christmas parties in the coatroom.

435
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,320
Still waiting for my reinforcements.

436
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,760
I know Clark, he'll be here...

437
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,440
...if he can.
- It's just a birthday.

438
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,000
Clark, what happened?
The police called.

439
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,200
- I'm fine.
- How's Pete?

440
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,480
He's got a serious migraine,
but other than that, he's okay.

441
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,160
Jodi's on the way to Metropolis General.
Her father's gonna meet her there.

442
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,760
Clark, I'm sorry about the party.

443
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,320
I promised Lana I'd be there.

444
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,480
I can't believe I let her down.

445
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,360
Well, when you do the things you do,
son, helping people...

446
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,400
...sometimes you have
to make sacrifices.

447
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
- Like Lana?
- Maybe...

448
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,360
...but you made your choice.

449
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,560
Where are you going?

450
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,080
I don't have to sacrifice everything.

451
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,560
Back for some more rocks?

452
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,840
Apparently, I have a clean bill of health.

453
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,520
Congratulations. I guess that means
you won't be bothering me anymore.

454
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,800
I couldn't figure out why
you're so resistant to accept my help...

455
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,200
...then I had a friend do some digging.

456
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:34,400
I thought you got kicked out of
Metropolis U for your meteor theories.

457
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,040
But apparently it was
your student-teacher relations.

458
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,120
I wonder if the Smallville Police
had you register.

459
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,120
Get out.

460
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,640
I want you to look at something.

461
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,480
I don't care about the past. I believe
in the power to reinvent yourself.

462
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,200
You want to prove
you've been right all along?

463
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,360
That check should cover
your vindication.

464
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,920
What you're looking for could take years.

465
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,400
I'm a patient man.

466
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,240
Tell me, why does a billionaire's son
care so much about a bunch of rocks...

467
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,840
...that fell out of the sky 12 years ago?

468
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,080
I save that story for the people I trust.

469
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,520
Kind of missed cocktail hour.

470
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,000
I'm sorry.

471
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,360
I told you I stopped believing
in happy birthdays a long time ago.

472
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,400
Well, maybe I can change that.

473
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,200
Okay, I know I blew it tonight,
but at least let me give you your present.

474
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,520
When?

475
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,480
Now.

476
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,000
Pass the popcorn.

477
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,360
- Lana.
- Yes?

478
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,680
Happy birthday.

479
