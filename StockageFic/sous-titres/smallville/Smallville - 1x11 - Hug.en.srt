1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,720
Killer view.

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,920
Good morning, Mr. Rickman.
Thank you for coming in.

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,280
So, what can I do for
the Center for Environmental Protection?

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,600
I heard your people were in Smallville
doing some surveying.

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,240
I wanted to discuss your intentions.

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,960
My intentions are to build a new plant.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,440
What's this?

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,800
Ground water from the last town
where you built a plant.

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,360
Well, I find that very hard to believe.

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,360
Rickman Industries has always had a very
good relationship with the CEP, Paul.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,080
- Can I call you Paul?
- No.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,280
Tomorrow I'll have a restraining order
preventing you...

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,040
...from moving into Smallville
until every case against you is settled.

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,080
It's too bad. L...
Well, I have my mind set on Smallville.

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,800
This town has a special place in my heart.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,560
I don't suppose there's anything
I could do to change your mind.

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,160
I'm afraid I'm not as easy to buy off
as my colleagues.

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,000
I've never bought off a soul in my life.

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,920
People listen to me because I'm right.

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,960
When they do, they end up better for it.

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,000
Tell that to the 96 cases
of vinyl chloride poisoning...

22
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,680
...I've tied to your pesticide plants.

23
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,200
Well, I see there's little else to do.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,920
Just want to tell you how much
I appreciate your candour.

25
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,520
I wish you luck.

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,520
Now, listen, Paul...
I can call you Paul, can't I?

27
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,640
I guess.

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,400
Now, you strike me
as a man of passion, Paul.

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,280
Passion hurts, doesn't it?

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,120
People don't understand. They don't see
how you devote yourself to what's right.

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,360
I bet you're afraid.

32
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,280
You give all that passion
to a job no one even cares about.

33
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,240
No.

34
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,000
Look at that world out there, Paul.

36
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,160
Is any part of it yours?

37
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,400
No.

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,440
All that pain you feel,
there's only one way to make it stop.

39
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,800
Going down?

40
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,200
Thanks.

41
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,040
Tyler, bring the car around.
We're going to Smallville.

42
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,800
Hug

43
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,960
Okay, here we go.

44
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,600
I thought learning to drive
my dad's Volvo was difficult...

45
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,040
...but at least the car had
windshield wipers.

46
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,560
- You're doing fine for your first time.
- No, no, we're turning.

47
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,120
So how's Whitney holding up?

48
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,120
His dad's still in the hospital, so he's
been working extra shifts at the store.

49
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,200
It's tough running a family business.

50
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,480
He secretly wants his dad to sell it.
He doesn't want it when he graduates.

51
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,240
I don't blame him. I don't see myself
being a farmer when I grow up.

52
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,080
- Well, what do you want to do?
- I'm not sure...

53
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,160
...as long as it doesn't involve putting
on a suit and doing a lot of flying.

54
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,720
I dropped my camera.

55
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,240
What'd you bring that thing for anyway?

56
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,080
I'm not out here doing
this butt-bashing thing for fun.

57
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,080
These woods are like the Bermuda Triangle
of Smallville.

58
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,960
People come in here, and when they
leave they can't remember a thing.

59
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,240
There've been dozens of incidents
the past 10 years.

60
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,080
- I'll go get you your camera.
- Thank you.

61
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,680
The stories in these woods
go back to the Civil War.

62
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,080
No, what I'm talking about
happened a week ago.

63
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,800
Surveyors from Rickman Industries
came out screaming...

64
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,840
...and can't remember what happened.
- I'm sure you have a theory.

65
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,040
- Kyle Tippett.
- The guy who sells weird sculptures?

66
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,480
Don't you think it's odd that he lives
all alone out here in the woods?

67
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,680
Thoreau did.

68
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,200
Yeah, Clark, so did the Unabomber.

69
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,640
Lana.

70
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,960
- Stay with the horses.
- Okay.

71
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,880
Whoa, whoa. Okay, okay.

72
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,800
Easy, easy.

73
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,640
Get away from her!

74
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,800
- You okay?
- Yeah, it's okay. I'm fine.

75
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,760
What do you think happened, son?

76
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,040
I don't know, but it just doesn't look
like he's trying to hurt her.

77
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,760
- Okay, Nell. Thanks. Bye.
- How's Lana?

78
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,240
A mild concussion.
Other than that, she's fine.

79
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,840
- And Nell?
- That's a different story.

80
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,200
She wants Clark to go to the police
and say he saw Kyle...

81
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,040
...spook Lana's horse and attack her.
- I didn't see that.

82
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,400
I don't think we've heard the end of this.

83
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,800
Did Kyle seem at all dangerous to you?

84
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,560
He seemed scared.

85
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,360
Chloe said some surveyors
were spooked last week...

86
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,720
...and now us.
I wonder if there's a connection.

87
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,200
Jonathan, go talk to Kyle.
Get this cleared up.

88
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,120
- Yeah.
- No, I'll go.

89
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,320
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- It's not like he can hurt me.

90
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,320
That is not the point.

91
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,800
Dad, I understand what it's like
to be hidden from the world.

92
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,160
Give me a shot.

93
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,400
- Do you know where Kyle lives?
- I just follow the trail of bad sculptures.

94
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,920
Miss Hardwick, I'm surprised
to find you in Smallville.

95
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,480
It grows on you after a while.

96
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't encourage him, Victoria.

97
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,920
It's funny. I was just saying
what this town needs...

98
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,520
...is more pesticides in the water supply.

99
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,840
Now, don't tell me you mind
someone else sharing your little sandbox.

100
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,920
Only when they're polluting it.
Hello, Bob.

101
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,920
Lex?

102
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,280
I'll leave you boys alone.

103
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,520
Photos are a bit over the top,
but I like what you've done with the place.

104
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,120
Oh, it's only temporary.

105
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,040
Here, have a button.

106
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,360
Enough of these, and they won't notice...

107
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,960
...you're rendering the town uninhabitable.
- I'm just like you, Lex.

108
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,280
A government employee sets
my emissions levels, and I abide.

109
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,720
Do you have an objection?

110
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,200
Let's call it an interest.
Smallville's my home now.

111
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,480
That's right. Yes, Lionel had mentioned
that he'd exiled you here.

112
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,960
- Had dinner with him a couple weeks ago.
- Yeah? What happened?

113
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,040
Somebody more important cancel on him?

114
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,480
Don't worry, Lex, I'll keep my concerns
away from the Luthors.

115
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,640
I found the perfect place for the plant.
It's out of the way, it's near the river.

116
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,000
The Kent farm?

117
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,240
I assume you've approached them.

118
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,560
It's just a formality.

119
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,560
The way licenses and zoning permits
always seem to be a formality for you.

120
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,480
I know the Kents, and not even you
can convince them to sell that farm.

121
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,160
You'd be surprised.

122
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Trust me, Bob, you're not that charming.

123
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,360
You're trespassing.

124
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,120
How'd you do that?

125
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,800
Magic. Haven't you heard of Crazy Kyle
who lives in the woods by himself?

126
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,640
He's somewhere between Bigfoot
and the Blair Witch.

127
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,000
- I'm...
- Clark Kent, Jonathan and Martha's son.

128
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,480
How'd you know?

129
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,560
I live in a trailer, not a cave.

130
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,480
I wanted to talk to you about
what happened this afternoon.

131
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,920
You mean the girl?

132
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,760
The horse threw her,
and I made sure she was breathing.

133
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,480
So you don't make a habit
of scaring people out of the woods...

134
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,360
...and spooking their horses?

135
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,080
If I wanted to explain myself all the time,
I'd get a job.

136
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,920
But I left that world behind for a reason.
Goodbye.

137
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,000
Why are you so unfriendly?

138
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,160
- Because I'm not interested in friends.
- Everyone needs a friend.

139
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,520
No, they don't...

140
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,760
...because they'll always betray you
in the end.

141
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,960
How are you feeling?

142
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,440
Better, thanks.

143
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,520
Nell said you're going to talk to the police.

144
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,240
Actually, I went out and spoke to Kyle.

145
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,400
You talked to that psycho?

146
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,640
Yeah.

147
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,920
He said he was making sure
Lana was okay.

148
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,040
- Do you believe him?
- Yeah, I think I do.

149
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,560
If I were there,
I would have done something.

150
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,320
- Do you remember anything?
- Not really.

151
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,160
I gotta get home. I'm glad you're okay.

152
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,760
That looked uncomfortable.

153
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,000
Listen, has Bob Rickman been by the farm?

154
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,760
- Why would he be interested in us?
- He's interested in buying your land.

155
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,520
You have met my dad.
Why are you even worried?

156
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,760
I've seen Rickman talk people out
of house and home. He's a locust, Clark.

157
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,280
He tears through a community
and betrays anyone who trusts him.

158
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,080
Tell your dad to be careful.

159
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay.

160
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,440
Hello, Kyle.
Wondering when you'd stop by.

161
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,360
We had an agreement.

162
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,440
You do whatever you want with the rest
of the world, but leave this town alone.

163
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,200
Well, we made those rules a long time
ago. The world's changed, Kyle.

164
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,120
Maybe it's time the public knew
the whole truth about Bob Rickman.

165
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,560
The public believes whatever I tell them.

166
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,800
I spent nine years honing my skill
while you hid in the woods...

167
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,000
...because you were afraid.

168
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,400
Take my hand. See how afraid I am.

169
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,320
You've been warned.

170
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,000
Kyle, what are you doing here?

171
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,360
I just registered a complaint.

172
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,600
What do you have against Rickman?

173
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,600
There used to be a time when people
minded their own business.

174
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,600
Hey, Tippett!

175
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,520
- And what's your problem?
- You are.

176
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,000
Touch Lana Lang again,
and I'll take care of you.

177
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,920
- Whitney, back off.
- I've got my eye on you.

178
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,680
- That's why I don't come into town.
- You want a ride home?

179
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,080
Why are you being so nice?

180
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,120
You're not a bad guy.
You're just not a people person.

181
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,160
- What gave that away?
- You want a ride or not?

182
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,200
Yeah, I gotta stop and get groceries.

183
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,440
No problem.

184
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,520
Excuse me.

185
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,440
I'm sorry, I couldn't help overhearing. Are
you having a problem with Kyle Tippett?

186
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,200
Yeah, he attacked my girlfriend.

187
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,040
Bob Rickman.

188
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,760
Maybe I can help.

189
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,720
Thanks for the ride,
I really appreciate it.

190
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,720
Next time, don't talk my ear off.

191
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,720
Hey, why were you at Rickman's?

192
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,720
Why were you at Rickman's?

193
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,160
I heard a rumour he was trying
to buy our farm.

194
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,720
Stay away from him.

195
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,240
Do you miss it? Regular life, I mean?

196
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,760
Some people weren't meant to have
a regular life, Clark.

197
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,680
Thanks.

198
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,400
Bye.

199
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,440
Whitney.

200
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,320
They're booking Kyle for assault.

201
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,520
All right, what happened, guys?

202
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,080
I saw Kyle in town. He blew me off,
so I came out here to talk.

203
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,680
You drove out here in the middle
of the night?

204
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,480
Yeah. I had a feeling
he was gonna attack Lana again.

205
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,120
Next thing I know,
he attacks me with a bat.

206
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,280
Is that what happened?

207
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,640
I did see Kyle swing at Whitney, but...

208
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
But what?

209
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,040
Kyle says Whitney swung at him first.

210
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,880
That's crazy. Why would I do that?

211
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,480
I don't know. None of this
makes any sense.

212
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,440
Yes, it does. First he attacks Lana,
then he comes after me.

213
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,720
- The guy needs to be locked up!
- We've all had a rough night.

214
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,280
- Just calm down.
- You saw it with your own eyes.

215
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,640
That freak tried to kill me!
Now you're saying it's my fault?

216
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,480
He's been a hermit for years, and suddenly
he's one of Smallville's most wanted.

217
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,960
- Something must have made him snap.
- I think it's Bob Rickman.

218
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,840
Yeah, but what does our rural Rodin
have against Rickman...

219
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,760
...other than the obvious
poisoning-the-environment angle?

220
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,160
I don't know. Could you do some digging,
find a connection?

221
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,680
Yeah, absolutely.
Sounds like an interesting story.

222
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,360
Tree-hugging hermit versus
pesticide tycoon.

223
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,400
- What do you think they have in common?
- Definitely not their grooming habits.

224
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,160
Lana.

225
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,200
Hey, what's wrong?

226
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,840
Can you give us a minute?

227
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,120
Yeah.

228
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,360
Whitney said you accused him
of attacking Kyle.

229
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
I didn't accuse him.
I have some questions.

230
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,800
- Like what?
- Like why was he there?

231
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,920
He was just trying to talk to him.

232
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,400
We both know Whitney can be
a little overzealous...

233
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,040
...but his heart's in the right place.

234
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,200
I just don't think Kyle would do that.
He doesn't seem violent.

235
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,600
You can tell from knowing him
for two days?

236
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,960
He's lived in the woods alone for 10 years.

237
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,280
But that makes him odd, not dangerous.

238
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,440
Whitney wouldn't attack anybody.

239
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,480
He strung me up in a field.

240
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,240
So that's what this is about?
You haven't forgiven him.

241
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,560
Lana, I just think there's
something else going on here.

242
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,240
Yeah, there is. You're looking for
an excuse to knock Whitney.

243
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,760
You know what he's going through
right now with his dad.

244
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,920
If you don't like him, just say it.
Don't pretend to be his friend.

245
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,520
You know, a barn's no place
for shoes like that.

246
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,640
Didn't like them that much anyway.

247
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,200
Bob Rickman, Rickman Industries.

248
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,440
I know who you are.

249
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,760
You probably know why I'm here.

250
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,280
I hear you're interested in this farm,
and you're a very persuasive fellow.

251
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,440
I gotta tell you, there's not a snowball's
chance in hell I'd consider selling...

252
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,280
...especially not to Rickman Industries.

253
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,120
You got a problem with progress?

254
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,880
I'm sceptical about anybody who thinks
they can solve my problems with money.

255
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,640
Why is that?

256
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,320
Well, because if I was interested
in money, I wouldn't be a farmer, would I?

257
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,720
If you'll excuse me, I got
some real work to do.

258
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,560
- What happened? You all right?
- Oh, I think I twisted my ankle.

259
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,480
I guess you were right about these shoes.

260
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,160
Could you give me a hand?

261
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,880
Now, are you sure I can't convince you
to change your mind?

262
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,880
How could you do this without telling me?

263
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,200
What happened to
"This land is our legacy"?

264
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,280
- What's going on, guys?
- Your father sold the farm to Bob Rickman.

265
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,640
What? How?

266
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,320
One minute I'm telling him
he doesn't stand a chance.

267
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
The next, I got a signed contract.

268
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,040
I called our lawyer. He said he can't do
anything until he sees the contract...

269
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,400
...but the devil-made-me-do-it argument
wouldn't hold up in court.

270
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,080
- Just can't believe I did this.
- What did Rickman do?

271
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,640
He made his case, he shook my hand.
That was it.

272
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,240
- It can't be that easy.
- How else do you explain my signature?

273
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,320
- I know someone who can help.
- No!

274
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,920
I will not owe Lex Luthor anything,
thank you.

275
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,240
Right now, you don't have
anything to owe.

276
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,680
So, what time are you working
at the store tomorrow?

277
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,360
Ouch. What's that all about?

278
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,080
I won't cave on my opinion of Kyle Tippett.
It put me on the outs with Lana.

279
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,600
So you're Atticus.

280
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,040
Atticus Finch, To Kill a Mockingbird?

281
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
- Never read it.
- You should.

282
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,040
You two have a lot in common.
Small-town heroes, believe in the truth...

283
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
...not willing to back down.

284
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,720
How's it end?

285
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,040
It's not about the ending.
It's about the journey.

286
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,520
What kills me is that I know I'm right.
I just wish I could get them to see it.

287
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,120
That, my friend, is the key to leadership...

288
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,560
...knowing you're right
and convincing everyone.

289
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,400
If you can do that, the world's your oyster.

290
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,240
Right now, I'd settle for getting
our farm back.

291
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,880
The good news is,
the deal's three times market value.

292
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,040
The bad news is, it's ironclad,
meaning it'll take a dozen extra lawyers.

293
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,560
Fortunately, I've got an army of them.

294
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,480
For once I think my parents will be glad
for your help.

295
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,360
I wonder what Rickman said
to convince your father.

296
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,040
I know the farm's in debt, but he'll pave
it and turn it into a wasteland...

297
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,080
...hardly better than the offers I made.

298
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,840
I just know my father
would never sell the farm.

299
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,520
Except that he did. Rickman's known
for getting past people's defences...

300
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,760
...but that's just good business. Unless
you think there's more to it than that.

301
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,600
Where are you going?

302
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,000
Jail.

303
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,200
Got a call you had a problem,
Mr. Rickman.

304
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,600
Yes, thank you for coming by, deputy.

305
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,040
No problem.

306
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,040
I need you to take care of an old friend.

307
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,800
Let's go, on your feet.
You have a visitor here.

308
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,840
Kyle!

309
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,280
No!

310
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,440
How bad?

311
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,560
It's no worse than when Ozzy snorted
that row of fire ants down in Queensland.

312
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,080
Is this guy really a doctor?

313
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,480
He was. Now he's more
of an on-call specialist.

314
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,640
You know, actors, rock stars,
billionaires' sons.

315
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,960
- How do you know him?
- Long story.

316
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,560
What's a guy gotta do
to get a drink around here?

317
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,560
Finish sewing.

318
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,920
Don't worry, Toby appreciates discretion.
Nobody will ever know Kyle was here.

319
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,240
Thanks.

320
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,640
I'm curious, why did you think
I'd be willing to harbour a fugitive?

321
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,760
My parents would freak, and if I took him
to a hospital, they'd put him back in jail.

322
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,480
You're the only one I could trust.

323
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,400
All in all, it's easier
than that knife wound of yours.

324
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,320
Club Zero, remember that?
Blood all over my Mustang.

325
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,840
- Can we talk to him now?
- I gave him something for the pain.

326
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,760
It's lights out until the morning.

327
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,840
My usual payment?

328
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,040
Brown bag on my desk.

329
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,280
- See you, Toby.
- Lex.

330
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,440
You'd better get home. It's late.

331
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,200
Hey, Atticus, you may want
to change your shirt.

332
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,320
Hi, Clark.

333
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,640
You're the last person I expected
to find here.

334
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,640
I heard Kyle Tippett escaped.
I was a little freaked out.

335
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,840
He's not coming after anybody.

336
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,880
- How do you know?
- I just do.

337
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,400
Sorry I bothered you.

338
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,840
If you were worried, why did you walk
all the way over here instead of calling?

339
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,320
I don't know. I thought you
might've changed your opinion.

340
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,520
Well, if you came over for an apology,
you're out of luck.

341
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,080
Clark, he escaped from jail.
You have to admit it looks pretty bad.

342
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,600
- You don't know the whole story.
- Then tell me. What is it?

343
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I don't know yet. You've already made up
your mind about him, so what do you care?

344
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,960
I wanted to clear the air
and preserve our friendship...

345
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,040
...but now I don't even know
why I bothered.

346
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,200
Here you go.

347
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,280
Thank you.

348
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,640
Hello, Lex.

349
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,880
Oh, come on, Lex,
this Art of War stuff is for amateurs.

350
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,720
It's not that. I just don't like you.

351
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,320
So my attorney tells me that my purchase
of the Kent farm is being challenged.

352
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,080
I warned you the Kents were
a tough nut to crack.

353
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,480
I recognize LuthorCorp lawyers
when I see them. Why are you involved?

354
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,160
Smallville's my home,
and the Kents are my friends.

355
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,160
Well, with friends like you, Lex...

356
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,840
Don't touch me.

357
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,800
Speaking of old friends,
I heard Kyle Tippett escaped from jail.

358
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,280
Now, why do you assume
we're old friends?

359
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,320
Just a rumour.

360
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,360
Have you seen him?

361
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,040
I never met the man, but I'll be sure
to pass on your regards when I do.

362
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,800
How'd you get my dad
to sign that contract?

363
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,200
Oh, you must be the Kent boy.

364
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,880
I'm a good businessman.
No hard feelings?

365
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,160
I spent the morning delving into
the exotic world of agriculture equipment...

366
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,360
...and it seems that Kyle and Rickman
were partners in the '80s.

367
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,200
- They sold farm equipment?
- Yeah...

368
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,600
...they were salesmen of the year
three years running, '89, '90, '91.

369
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,080
The next year, Rickman started
his own company, and Kyle went Walden.

370
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,400
- I wonder what happened?
- I don't know...

371
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,080
...but I found this story
in the Smallville Ledger.

372
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,000
"Salesmen trapped in car
after meteor shower."

373
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,920
I'm guessing whatever's going on started
that sunny October day, 12 years ago.

374
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,080
- Let's go ask him.
- Wait, you know where he is?

375
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,600
Where's Kyle?

376
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,360
Who?

377
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,360
I think I know where he went.

378
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,120
I appreciate the help,
but I'm done here.

379
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,040
- We know Rickman was your partner.
- It was a million years ago.

380
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,560
What happened to you guys
in that meteor shower?

381
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,120
Trust me, you're not the only ones
that were affected by it.

382
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,160
What's going on with you and Rickman?
How did he get my dad to sell our farm?

383
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,560
You know, until that day, we were the
worst salesmen to ever carry a catalog.

384
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,320
All that changed after they
pulled us out of that car.

385
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,040
With a handshake we could get people
to do whatever we wanted them to do...

386
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,640
...buy a tractor, stand on one leg.

387
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,600
You had the power of persuasion?

388
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,840
How long does it last?

389
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,080
Until the person does
what I tell them to do.

390
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,400
It could be two minutes, two hours.

391
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Then they come out of it
without a memory.

392
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,320
What happens if they can't do it?

393
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,800
They keep trying unless they're forcibly
snapped out of it, like your friend Whitney.

394
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,520
Well, it sounds good in theory,
but how about you prove it?

395
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,720
- Chloe.
- What?

396
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,520
The guy lives in a crappy trailer.

397
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,680
If he has this power, he'd use it
to sell these sculptures.

398
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,120
It's dangerous.

399
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,040
I'm used to living on the edge.

400
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,360
You have feelings for Clark, don't you,
Chloe? You see him, and you want him.

401
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:44,000
All this time, you've been hiding it.
Now you can show him.

402
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,480
Okay, come on, I'm ready.

403
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,080
What? Why are you looking
at me like that?

404
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,560
And why is my mouth minty?

405
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,040
Let's just say he proved his point.

406
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,880
Oh, God, did I just...?

407
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,280
Don't worry, it was fine.

408
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:37,120
Well, now that the party trick's over,
I gotta hit the road.

409
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,520
Wait, you have these gifts,
but you hid in the woods. Why?

410
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,520
Because I was scared
that I wouldn't be able to control it...

411
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,600
...and I'd wind up like Bob.
- What happened between you two?

412
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,160
- Why does he want to kill you?
- He knows that I know his secret...

413
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,040
...and I threatened to expose him
if he built a plant here.

414
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,200
Yeah, but he's been destroying
communities like this for years.

415
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,640
- How come you let him get away with it?
- I wanted to be left alone!

416
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,720
- Lf it wasn't here, it wasn't my problem.
- My dad lost our farm because of you.

417
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,040
Do you know what it's like to have
to hide because of who you are?

418
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,120
Yes, I do.

419
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,480
But when you have a gift, you can't just
hide in a hole and hope it goes away.

420
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,160
How did you get in?

421
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,000
Oh, your guard at the front gate
let me through. He's a great guy.

422
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,000
I didn't realize we had a meeting.

423
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,080
We don't. I come with an olive branch.

424
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,800
You can call off your lawyers.

425
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,960
I'm dropping the Kent farm
as a proposed site.

426
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,000
What's the matter? Losing your touch?

427
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,760
No, I've just decided Smallville
really isn't worth the hassle.

428
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,680
At least I know where I'm not wanted.

429
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,160
Okay, then. Thanks for stopping by.

430
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,760
Well, since you won,
how about it? Truce?

431
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,840
- Hello?
- Lex, it's me.

432
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,680
What's going on?

433
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,480
I'm with Kyle. He wants to go public
about Rickman.

434
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,520
No kidding? What does he know?

435
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,320
Enough to bring him down.

436
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,840
All right, I'm coming to pick you up.
Where are you?

437
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,600
I called friends at the Planet
and the Inquisitor.

438
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,040
Would you be willing to talk to them?

439
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,800
I'll do what I have to to stop him.

440
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,720
Get in. I have to fill up
if we're going to Metropolis.

441
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,520
Thanks, Lex.

442
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,120
Lex?

443
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,400
What's going on?

444
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,080
Rickman's got to him!

445
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,760
Clark, you have some explaining to do.

446
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,120
What just happened?

447
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,120
I have my suspicions.

448
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,720
I hate to think that you failed
to get the job done.

449
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,400
Relax, failing isn't something I do.

450
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,560
Just in case.

451
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,320
I always knew you were keeping
secrets from me, Clark.

452
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,840
But I never thought they were this good.

453
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,840
Clark, you know that guy
you're trying to protect?

454
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,520
I'm gonna shoot him now.

455
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,200
Lex.

456
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,680
There you are.

457
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,320
Don't do this. I'm your friend.

458
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,880
Oh, please. You think I don't see
the way your parents look at me...

459
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,520
...the way half the town looks at me?
You're no different.

460
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:53,040
Friendship's a fairy tale, Clark. Respect
and fear are the best you can hope for.

461
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,360
- Rickman's doing this to you.
- What if he did?

462
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,960
- You hate Rickman.
- You can learn a lot from those you hate.

463
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,440
Hello, Bob.

464
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,600
Lex!

465
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,200
I always was the better salesman.

466
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,280
Are you okay?

467
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,240
I saw you get shot, Clark.

468
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,960
Don't worry. Just don't hide
in the woods like I did.

469
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,760
You got a gift.
Use it to do great things.

470
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,480
I think I'll do the same with mine.

471
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,000
I can't believe each one
of these bruises was a bullet.

472
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,680
- Sorry.
- Guess that answers that question.

473
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,000
It's weird. I get shot at,
and the bullets are fired by my best friend.

474
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,520
- What do you think happened to Kyle?
- I don't know...

475
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,120
...but I think he's out in the world
trying to make a difference now.

476
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,760
Hi, I hope I'm not interrupting.

477
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,280
No, come on in.

478
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,680
We'll be outside.

479
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,880
I didn't know if we were still talking.

480
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,440
I'm not sure what happened with Kyle,
and it's really not important...

481
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,800
...because I think our friendship
is worth more than one argument.

482
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,040
Yeah, me too.

483
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,800
You know, I thought
we were done there for a while.

484
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,800
You and me are gonna be friends
for a very long time.

485
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,640
We may have our ups and downs,
but that's just the way it works.

486
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,520
Did Chloe really kiss you?

487
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,240
Clark.

488
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,920
Hey.

489
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:31,360
Tell your dad I spoke to my lawyers.
Because of Rickman's untimely demise...

490
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,760
...they're not expanding.
They ripped up the contract.

491
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,520
- Thanks.
- Hey, what are friends for?

492
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,440
How're you feeling?

493
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,760
I still don't remember what happened.
Are you sure I didn't hurt you?

494
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,800
I wonder where Kyle is now?

495
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,440
I don't know.

496
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,640
