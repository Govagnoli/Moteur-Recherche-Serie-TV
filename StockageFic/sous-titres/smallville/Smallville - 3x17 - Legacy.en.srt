1
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:09,698
Jonathan, what are you doing up there?

2
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:11,707
Clark should be doing that.

3
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:15,541
Sweetheart, I'm fine.
Would you stop worrying?

4
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:22,246
Jonathan, please be careful.

5
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:25,516
Martha, my father and I built this roof.

6
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,559
I could walk this roof with my eyes closed.

7
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,929
You know what the doctor said
about taking it easy.

8
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,935
You know, the last time I checked,
the doctor didn't have a farm to run.

9
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,180
Jonathan?

10
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:52,946
Jonathan!

11
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,084
Clark!

12
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,536
Dad, what are you doing, trying to fly?

13
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,037
-Are you all right?
-Jonathan!

14
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:19,606
It was just that noise.
Where the hell did that come from?

15
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,246
I didn't hear anything.

16
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,943
It was probably nothing.

17
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,020
Dad, look, you don't have to--

18
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,384
Damn it, Kal-El, I can get it myself.

19
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,116
Kal-El?

20
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,958
Why'd you call me that?

21
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,621
I don't know.

22
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,028
You heard a noise.
What did it sound like?

23
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,193
-lt was just a loud, high-pitched--
-Hum? It was the key.

24
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,965
Clark, I slipped and fell off the roof, okay?

25
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,773
Are you sure this has nothing
to do with Jor-El?

26
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,435
I thought we agreed
we were gonna drop that.

27
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,260
What?

28
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,765
He is?

29
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:56,306
All right, have the chopper standing by.

30
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,394
Why did you have to bring him
into this, Jor-El?

31
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,033
Whatever promises my dad made,
I'll take them on.

32
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,399
Come on!

33
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,403
Come on, Jor-El, I'm the one you want!

34
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,566
Who is that? Who's down here?

35
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,930
Oh, Clark, it's you.

36
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,937
Don't let me interrupt you.

37
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:09,738
-I just came down here to be alone.
-Yeah, I can understand that.

38
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:15,218
Sometimes, when I'm down here,
and I look at these walls...

39
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:20,451
...I feel as if it might be possible
to solve the mysteries of the universe.

40
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,894
What do you think?

41
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,294
I think it's time for me to go.

42
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,901
Clark.

43
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:36,107
How's your father?
How's his recovery progressing?

44
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,471
He's better.

45
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,847
I can only imagine how difficult it must be
for you to see him so....

46
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:47,814
So weak.

47
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,657
Weak, strong, healthy, he's still my dad...

48
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,383
...and I love him.

49
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,959
Of course you do.

50
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,930
A son's love for a father,
there's nothing to compare it to.

51
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,596
After all, you only get one.

52
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,623
Clark?

53
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,951
I'm having a strange case of deja vu.

54
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,991
Why the sudden resurgence
of interest in the caves?

55
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,060
Lex...

56
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:41,964
...Iisten, something truly extraordinary
has happened.

57
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:46,231
Do you remember the octagonal hole,
or the indentation...

58
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,307
...that was in one of the walls
of the cave?

59
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:52,740
I'm sorry, Dad.
That's your obsession, not mine.

60
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:58,612
All right, but you remember
the hole was sealed over?

61
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,119
Yesterday, I found Clark Kent down there.

62
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,985
-Clark.
-Yes.

63
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,821
And the hole was open.
He'd opened it somehow.

64
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,565
You know, Dad...

65
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:18,693
...they say mental illness is hereditary.

66
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:22,670
I'm willing to accept my break with reality.
Are you?

67
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:26,005
Oh, Lex, men of vision
have so often been mocked.

68
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,977
Galileo knew it was the Earth
that orbited the sun...

69
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,639
...and he was sentenced to death
for that discovery.

70
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,809
Where's the lnquisition
when you need it?

71
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:37,820
Don't let your friendship
with Clark Kent blind you, son.

72
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,016
Don't forget it was Clark
who discovered the caves.

73
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:45,460
Then one of the symbols from the caves
mysteriously appeared on his barn.

74
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:49,431
The hole sealed itself up the same day
that explosion happened on his farm.

75
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,799
-Probably coincidence.
-Coincidence.

76
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,772
That's an explanation
used by fools and liars.

77
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:03,376
Lex, we could accomplish so much
if we work together.

78
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:07,349
Don't pretend that this isn't
an obsession that you and I share.

79
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,750
We both know that you have
an entire archive...

80
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,686
...devoted to uncovering the mystery
of Clark Kent...

81
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:17,228
...and if you won 't help me,
I'll find someone else who will.

82
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,307
You said there' d be more time.

83
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,848
Who are you talking to?

84
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:43,479
I'm not talking to anybody, Clark.
I'm just thinking out loud, that's all.

85
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,715
Were you talking to Jor-El?

86
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,725
Listen, son, not everything
is about your real father, okay?

87
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,092
-He's not my real father.
-Yes, he is, Clark.

88
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,494
He is.

89
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:02,706
He's gonna be around this place
long after I'm gone, anyway.

90
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,176
Dad, what's going on with you?

91
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,836
I don't expect you to understand
any of this stuff, Clark, but l....

92
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,841
I almost died, and I look
around here and I think...

93
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,749
...what in the hell did l
really accomplish anyway?

94
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,117
You're lucky, Clark.

95
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,522
You won't ever have to face
your mortality.

96
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,028
But if you did...

97
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,057
...you'd find yourself
reevaluating your choices too.

98
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,802
Like taking me in?

99
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,837
Clark, no, that's not....

100
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:44,407
I would never regret that.
There's just so many chances I never took.

101
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,643
I have to live with my mistakes.

102
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,445
Don't let my mistakes be yours.

103
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,821
You're tired.

104
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,829
Let's go inside.

105
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,270
The last thing we want to do
is call more attention to this.

106
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,987
That looks a little heavy for Psych 1 01.

107
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,691
I'm just trying to get a handle
on what my dad's going through.

108
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,266
The surgery and everything.

109
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,134
When I was in the hospital
the doctors told me...

110
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,139
...that depression's pretty common
after a major surgery.

111
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,710
He's just not the same dad I know.

112
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,146
He keeps talking about all these
opportunities he missed in his life.

113
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,744
Clark, it's gonna be okay.

114
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,152
There isn't anything
that you can't recover from.

115
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:03,189
What if you screw up something so badly
you can never get it back?

116
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,662
I guess that depends
on how determined you are.

117
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,002
So what's with the cave obsession?

118
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,544
You listened to the conversation.
It's one of my father's eccentricities.

119
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,205
Along with Clark Kent?

120
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,250
Trust me, Clark has nothing
to do with my father.

121
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,650
That's not what it sounded like to me.

122
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,757
When the Metropolis police
had that noose around your neck...

123
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:36,417
-...you offered us full disclosure--
-Look, don't try to hang this on me.

124
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,632
Before I agreed to help, all you had
on my father was creative bookkeeping.

125
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,827
I'm giving you illegal cellular research,
cloning, crimes against humanity.

126
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,369
So leave Clark out of this.

127
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:52,468
"You've got an entire archive
devoted to unlocking...

128
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,842
...the mystery of Clark Kent."

129
00:11:56,682 --> 00:12:00,140
That sounds to me like more
than your average kid from Podunk.

130
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:07,018
Maybe if I speak into the microphone,
you'll hear it clearer.

131
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,559
Clark Kent is nobody.

132
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,995
A nobody who's pals
with Dr. Virgil Swann?

133
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,953
Corporate titans don't often show up
at my doorstep unannounced.

134
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,231
I apologize for surprising you like this,
Dr. Swann...

135
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,395
...but it's a matter of some urgency.

136
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:58,566
I've been wondering how long it would
take you to finally walk through the door.

137
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:02,236
Then you obviously know why I'm here.

138
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:06,373
I think, perhaps, you've been reading
my e-mails to Clark Kent. Am I correct?

139
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:12,919
My transgression doesn't seem
to upset you. I'm glad.

140
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,855
I'm a scientist.

141
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:19,289
I find curiosity to be
a most admirable trait.

142
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:26,168
Dr. Swann, I am the conservator
of the Kawatche Caves.

143
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:30,297
If you can tell me what is written
on the cave walls...

144
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,879
...I would agree to hand over
that conservancy to your foundation.

145
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,082
Well, thank you,
but I'm afraid I can't help you.

146
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,115
The language remains a mystery to me.

147
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:47,892
Are you aware that at one time
there was an octagonal keyhole...

148
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,552
...on the wall of the cave?

149
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,220
It was sealed for months.

150
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,458
Then it reopened suddenly.

151
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,398
Just after our friend Clark
had been down there.

152
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,967
Then you don't need me.
You need a locksmith.

153
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,332
Right, but...

154
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,207
...the key to that lock
was in my possession...

155
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,210
...but it was stolen from my safe.

156
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,712
Again, Clark had been present.

157
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:18,313
So now you believe that he has it.

158
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,020
He trusts you.

159
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,390
Would you be willing to talk to him?

160
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,058
It's such a small price to pay...

161
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,866
...in exchange for the answers
you've been searching for.

162
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,476
Yes, well, I know what I'm after...

163
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,512
...but what do you expect to find?

164
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,280
You're dying.

165
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,048
How do you know that?

166
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:58,054
As I said, curiosity is an admirable trait.

167
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,602
Dr. Swann...

168
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,874
...I know that what can save my life
is locked within the wall of that cave.

169
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,914
I believe in the extraordinary...

170
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,574
...in the possibilities it holds.

171
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,113
But I prefer to follow my own path.

172
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,458
All right.

173
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,498
Thank you for your time, doctor.

174
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:44,208
Even if you had the key...

175
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:49,371
...you have no idea what would happen
if you put it into the lock.

176
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,811
I'd be willing to take that risk.

177
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:02,360
Then perhaps there is
an arrangement we might make.

178
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:26,877
Clark. I'm afraid I've invaded
your sanctuary.

179
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:30,715
-What do you think you'll find down here?
-You tell me.

180
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,948
How'd you open it, Clark?

181
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,788
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I don't want to play games.

182
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:42,867
You expect me to believe your fascination
with these caves started with a term paper?

183
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,026
No, do it again.

184
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:49,197
I don't think you wanna start talking
about unusual obsessions, Mr. Luthor.

185
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,641
Unless you want to explain why you
blackmailed my friends into spying on me.

186
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,274
I believe that we're put on this Earth
for a reason, Clark.

187
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,878
Our task in life is to find out
what that reason is.

188
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:07,084
Sometimes, we can't do that alone.

189
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,327
You're never gonna find
what you're looking for.

190
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,134
I'm much closer than you think.

191
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,718
What's going on here?

192
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,220
Take the barn. The rest follow me.
Martha Kent?

193
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,817
-What are you doing?
-FBl. We're searching this place.

194
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,986
-You can't.
-We can, and we will.

195
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,189
Excuse me, ma'am, we need you outside.

196
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,736
Hi, Mom.
You must be out looking for Dad too.

197
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:30,602
I think I have an idea where he is.
I'll see you soon.

198
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,114
Thanks for the phone.

199
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,613
Clark, what's going on?

200
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,348
My dad kind of went AWOL.

201
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,049
He was halfway through
unloading the feed run...

202
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,492
...and just jumped in his truck
and took off.

203
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,459
I'm sorry, Lana. It's....

204
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:01,034
-He's never done anything like this before.
-Hey, you know what?

205
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,065
It's gonna be okay.

206
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,611
I didn't mean to unload on you like that.

207
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,409
No, you....

208
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,676
You never have to apologize
for opening up to me.

209
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,165
Lana?

210
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,705
I know this is a stressful time for you.

211
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,937
No. That's not what this is about.

212
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,148
Lana, I don't want to
look back like my dad...

213
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,852
...and wonder what my life
could've been.

214
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,186
Clark.

215
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,619
We've tried this once before.

216
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,226
You said there's nothing
you can't recover from.

217
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,333
No, I wasn't talking about us.

218
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:08,130
Look, right now,
think about your dad, okay?

219
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,741
He's the one who needs you.

220
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,371
Yeah.

221
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,997
Dad, are you okay?

222
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,895
Mom and I have been
worried sick about you.

223
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,061
You can't just take off like that.

224
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,531
How'd you know to find me out here?

225
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:48,137
When I'm searching for answers,
I turn to my dad.

226
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,148
I guess it runs in the family.

227
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,912
Your grandfather was
the stubbornest man I ever knew.

228
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,324
And believe me...

229
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,296
...Clark, I wasn't nearly the son you are.

230
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,630
My mother used to say that...

231
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:14,801
...he and I were like watching
two sides of the same coin...

232
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,269
...duking it out.

233
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,605
I see the way you and Jor-El fight
and I wonder...

234
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,443
...if maybe fathers and sons
were the same on Krypton.

235
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,246
Except he's not my father. You are.

236
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,756
Yeah.

237
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,459
I am your father who turns his back on you
when you need him the most.

238
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,466
I am your father
who forces you to run away.

239
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,932
My father never would've done that.

240
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,773
I wish I had his strength and his wisdom.

241
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,844
Dad, you do.

242
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,208
Clark, I don't know
how to protect you anymore.

243
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,087
That's not your job.

244
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:11,058
Your job is to teach me
how to protect myself...

245
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,724
...but that doesn't mean I don't need you.

246
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,526
Mom needs you too.

247
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,207
Let's go home.

248
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,793
I realize paying the Talon's bills...

249
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:53,131
...isn't the high point of your month...

250
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,732
...but I'm guessing
something else is going on.

251
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,634
No. No, everything's fine.

252
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:05,879
Lana, you know you could
talk to me about anything.

253
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:23,827
I wanna believe that
someone can change, but....

254
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,973
But I'm starting to lose faith.

255
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,614
Are we talking about Clark?

256
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:55,996
You know, he came by the Talon earlier...

257
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,730
...and he kissed me.

258
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,371
He kissed you?

259
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,241
Isn't that what you wanted?

260
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,642
God, I don't....

261
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,253
I don't know.

262
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,823
Look.

263
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:38,871
I'm afraid I'm a little jaded
in the romance department.

264
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,973
The only thing I know
about relationships is that...

265
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,646
...someone usually winds up
getting hurt.

266
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,587
And you don't think I can
trust Clark to not do that?

267
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,157
I don't think it's about trust.

268
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:04,264
It's like the German poet Rilke said:

269
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,634
A person isn't who they are during
the last conversation you had with them.

270
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:16,213
They're who they've been
throughout your whole relationship.

271
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:35,259
-Mom!
-Oh, thank God you're back.

272
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:38,493
-What happened?
-The FBl came and tore through everything.

273
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,338
-What did they want?
-They had a search warrant.

274
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:44,441
The only thing that's missing is the key.

275
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,381
I have to get that back.
If they find out what it's for....

276
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,076
-lt doesn't matter, Clark.
-How can you say that?

277
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,555
Because they didn't get
what they came for.

278
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,504
Lex!

279
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,645
Clark, I'm busy. Can this wait?

280
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,280
The FBl just raided our farm.

281
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,856
Any idea why?

282
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,830
They didn't say, but for some reason,
I think your dad's involved.

283
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:48,366
Clark, I can't imagine my father's
on the FBl's most trusted list...

284
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,031
...but I'm curious why you think
he'd be interested.

285
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:54,007
I talked to him today.
He said some crazy things.

286
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,478
He thinks I can give him answers
about the caves.

287
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,817
Can you?

288
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:04,851
My father's methods can be questionable,
but usually there's truth in his madness.

289
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:10,023
He's so obsessed about those caves
that he's imagining things that don't exist.

290
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,665
Clark, I'm glad you told me about this.

291
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,959
It means a lot that you trust me
enough to let me help.

292
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,799
Is there something you're not telling me?

293
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,100
And what would that be, Clark?

294
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,310
I'll check into it.

295
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,152
What the hell were you doing
at the Kent farm?

296
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,625
Be quiet.

297
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:48,960
You're bound and determined
to blow our cover, aren't you? Get in here.

298
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:57,206
If I want to look at Clark Kent,
you won't have much to say about it.

299
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,708
-Those weren't your men?
-We don't storm farmhouses as a habit.

300
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,445
What is it about this kid
you're trying to protect?

301
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,434
Look, Luthor, this is my show.

302
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:34,601
-Do I need to remind you you came to us?
-Like I had a choice.

303
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:39,249
You know the deal.
The FBl isn't interested in some farm boy.

304
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,783
We're interested in your father.

305
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:45,047
Now, get out of here
so we can do our work.

306
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,456
Your father's not working with the FBl!
It's you!

307
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:58,500
-Clark, you have to trust me.
-I did.

308
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,128
I guess it was a bad mistake.

309
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,934
Clark, you've got it all wrong!

310
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,976
Look, it's not about you!
We're going after my father!

311
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:11,641
He tried to pin the murders at Metron Labs
on me, so I went to the feds...

312
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,841
...and I cut a deal.

313
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,646
Look, over and over...

314
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:19,813
...I've given him the chance
to show me who he really is...

315
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:23,586
...and I now realize he already has.
He deserves what's coming to him.

316
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:28,131
-You don't care whose privacy gets invaded.
-lt wasn't the FBl who raided the farm.

317
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:32,429
My father may have had men impersonate
the feds. The question is why.

318
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,698
Maybe he's on to you!
Maybe he's warning you to back off.

319
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,638
If that's the case,
I'm sorry he got you involved...

320
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:42,302
-...but I think you already were.
-What's that supposed to mean?

321
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,041
How well do you know
a Dr. Virgil Swann?

322
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,816
What makes you think I know him at all?

323
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,547
According to the FBl,
my father's been talking to him...

324
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,021
...and he found Dr. Swann through you.

325
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,989
You two have been e-mailing each other?

326
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,459
He's been studying the cave paintings.

327
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,689
I don't know how you
stumbled into this...

328
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:05,661
...but somehow you've got two billionaires
keenly interested in you and those caves.

329
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:09,503
They're your enemies, not me.

330
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,349
You betrayed me!

331
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,041
Hello, Kal-El.

332
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,376
My name is Clark.

333
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:27,387
You think I betrayed you
because I met with Lionel Luthor?

334
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,494
You did more than meet with him.
You agreed to help him.

335
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,153
I didn't betray you, Kal-El.

336
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:37,461
I promised you your secret would never
leave this building, and it hasn't.

337
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:41,036
My involvement with Lionel Luthor
is in your best interest.

338
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,740
That man has done nothing
but cause my family pain.

339
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:47,370
Was he the one who caused
the explosion on the farm?

340
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:51,242
Did he make you run wild in Metropolis?

341
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:56,311
I opened the door to your heritage...

342
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:59,320
...because I thought that you were ready.

343
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:03,320
Your actions over the past year
have proven me wrong.

344
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,326
You don't understand.

345
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:11,701
There was another message in the ship,
from my biological father.

346
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,101
It said I was sent here to conquer.

347
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,968
Do you know if that's true?

348
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:22,168
I don't have all the answers.

349
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,781
I'm still on the same journey
as you are, Kal-El.

350
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:31,388
Please. Don't call me that.
I don't even know who that is.

351
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,354
Fathers often want futures
that their sons reject.

352
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,689
That struggle is as old
as the human race.

353
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:43,064
Except I'm not human.

354
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:47,895
Humanity is not only about biology.

355
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:51,066
Look, you don't know Jor-El.

356
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,902
Everything that he said
has come to pass.

357
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,879
My father made a deal with him to save me,
and now it's killing him.

358
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:02,584
But the more you pursue this course,
the greater the risk...

359
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:06,720
...that you'll expose your secret
not only to the Luthors...

360
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,449
...but to the world.

361
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:12,057
I can't let my father die for my mistakes.

362
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,425
Well, if that's your decision...

363
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:22,466
...then there's something else
I have to show you.

364
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,841
Activate screen.

365
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,562
It says, "l am waiting."

366
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,764
It must be from Jor-El.

367
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:54,234
That message didn't come
from the stars.

368
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,670
It originated right here on Earth.

369
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,568
But I believe...

370
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:05,376
...that it wasn't meant for you, Kal-El.

371
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,674
Dad?

372
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,447
Mom, where's Dad?

373
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,180
He left again, Clark.

374
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,051
Don't be too hard on him.

375
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,284
He can't do what he used to
around here.

376
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,328
Mom, I don't think it's that simple.
I just went to see Dr. Swann.

377
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,259
He thinks Jor-El
is trying to contact someone.

378
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,994
Mom, it's not me,
and the way Dad's been acting...

379
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,229
...I think he's getting
messages through the key.

380
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,135
What would Jor-El want with your dad?

381
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:07,869
He said Jor-El was waiting for something.
Do you know where Dad went?

382
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,612
-You searched every inch of that farm?
-Yes.

383
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:16,151
-You're certain?
-Yes, sir, I assure you. It's not there.

384
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:20,020
Everybody out of here. Get out.
Right now! Get out of here!

385
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,557
Out of here. Now!

386
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,061
-I said, everybody get out of here!
-Go on, get out.

387
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,697
You have no right to be down here.

388
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:33,735
Well, the State Park Service
might disagree with you.

389
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,671
You want something that doesn't belong
to you. I'm not gonna let you take it.

390
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:43,541
There exists in this world some things
too valuable to belong to any one person.

391
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:47,446
I am sick and tired of talking to you.

392
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:50,985
This is your last warning.
Stay away from my son.

393
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:54,750
If you raised your son the way I raised mine,
he wouldn't need protection.

394
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,417
You know, weakness isn't
something you're born with.

395
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,962
You learn it,
and Clark learned his from you.

396
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,666
Dad!

397
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,535
Dad!

398
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,571
What are you doing?
You're not thinking!

399
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,270
It's the only way that I know you're safe.

400
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:32,445
Unless you want to explain to the police
why you illegally raided my farm...

401
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:36,487
...you had better let me walk out of here.

402
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:38,987
Back off.

403
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,059
Sir...

404
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,030
...you better take a look at this.

405
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,479
The key's in the wall.

406
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:05,688
It must be.

407
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,894
Where is it, Clark?

408
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,027
I don't have it.

409
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,510
Hi.

410
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,124
I know you got a lot going on right now.

411
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:49,664
I think we left things
in kind of a weird place.

412
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:55,032
I know the way I've been acting
is kind of hard to understand...

413
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,232
...but, Lana, my feelings for you
have never changed.

414
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,907
I guess a part of me knows that.

415
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,240
But, you know, it's like Lex says...

416
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:07,578
...a person isn't who they say they are
in any one moment.

417
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,346
-They're who they've always been--
-Lex?

418
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:12,148
What does he have to do with this?

419
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:17,283
I trust him. I trust his advice.
He only wants what's best for us.

420
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:22,589
Lana, how many times have we been
standing here avoiding what we both want?

421
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:26,397
That's because every time
you've let me get close...

422
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,765
...it hurts that much more
when you leave.

423
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,075
You can't keep changing the rules.

424
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:35,109
I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt you.

425
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:39,113
-But I promise, I'm not leaving this time.
-Maybe I am.

426
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:44,243
You know what your dad said
about looking back...

427
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,652
...and feeling as though
he'd missed something?

428
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:50,687
Clark, I have been so focused on you...

429
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:53,728
...waiting to see if we could
ever get back together...

430
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,765
...that maybe I'm missing out
on some opportunities.

431
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:02,495
-Like seeing other people?
-No. No, I mean everything.

432
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:08,640
And until I figure that out,
I can't keep doing this.

433
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,448
It's not fair to either of us.

434
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,217
Clark.

435
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,288
Lana sure didn't stay very long.

436
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,659
No.

437
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:07,867
-You all right, son?
-Yeah.

438
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,571
Dad, we're going to have to talk
about what happened down in the cave.

439
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,541
I know.

440
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:20,243
You always tell me to be so careful
around Lionel Luthor, and then you just....

441
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:25,253
-Why'd you go down there with the key?
-I'm not sure. I was just drawn to it.

442
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,118
It's the only way I can explain it.

443
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:31,555
Dad, I know it's the deal you made
with Jor-El.

444
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:36,967
I thought you sacrificed your health to bring
me home, but it's more than that, isn't it?

445
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:43,337
Clark, look, I've done a lot of things the last
few days I'm not particularly proud of...

446
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:47,233
...but it wasn't Jor-El who did them,
it was me.

447
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,680
What's Jor-El waiting for?

448
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,279
How do you know about that?

449
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,652
Dr. Swann.

450
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,619
-Dad, what did you promise him?
-That's none of your concern, Clark.

451
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:11,358
Dad, if it wasn't for me, you never
would've gotten involved with Jor-El.

452
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:13,901
Come on, why don't you let me help?

453
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,904
I've always told you to take
responsibility for your decisions.

454
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,974
Now let me take responsibility for mine.

455
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,543
Because now we're both
in Lionel's sights...

456
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:25,307
...and what are we gonna do
when he gets that key out of the wall?

457
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,116
The key is not in the wall, Clark.

458
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:32,551
-You took it.
-No.

459
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:38,125
But it's still out there somewhere.

460
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
