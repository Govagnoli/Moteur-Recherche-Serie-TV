1
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:12,572
Yeah.

2
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:15,011
It's James Beels.

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,982
Lionel Luthor. He's expecting my call.

4
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:23,949
So how about this: I don't care
if he's in a meeting, get him out of it!

5
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:27,185
Tell him I found something!

6
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,819
No, I won't hold! Get him!

7
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,846
What's your hurry, pal?

8
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:57,522
Hey.

9
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:00,192
Move it, already!

10
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,433
Get out of my way!

11
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,720
Hey, in the truck! You all right?

12
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:38,521
Hey, hey!
Come on. Gotta get you out of here.

13
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:52,379
Smoke. Smoke.
I'm gonna put you down.

14
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,118
All right, come on, now.

15
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,624
Can you hear me? Are you okay?

16
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,668
We gotta get you out of here.

17
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,560
Dr. Hamilton.

18
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:26,729
I thought part of our arrangement
was that you don't drop in on me.

19
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,568
A situation's come up in my lab.

20
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,004
Don't you mean your barn?

21
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:33,340
One of my experiments was stolen
by one of your employees.

22
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:35,982
Why would anyone at LuthorCorp
know about your work?

23
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,211
-He was helping me install new equipment.
-What'd he steal?

24
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,886
A flower.

25
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:46,450
You're kidding.

26
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:49,824
It's called the Nicodemus.
It's been extinct for a hundred years.

27
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,989
I hired you to study the effects
of meteors on this town.

28
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,465
That is your focus. You're a geologist.

29
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,571
Why are you wasting time bringing
flowers back from the dead?

30
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,572
I irradiated the dormant seeds
with meteor fragments.

31
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,540
I want to know the effects on people,
not plants.

32
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:07,613
It's a first step. That's what science is.

33
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,942
It's a process, a journey. You know what?

34
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:13,018
Either you understand that,
or you find someone else.

35
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:17,517
What's his name?

36
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:24,295
James Beels. I just found out he was in
a car accident. He almost didn't make it...

37
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:25,898
...but another driver pulled him out.

38
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,801
-Don't tell me it was Clark Kent.
-Actually it was his father, Jonathan.

39
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,648
Mom? Dad?

40
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,012
I just heard about the....

41
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,855
I did not need to see that.

42
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:56,588
Hey, son. Just getting the old hero's
welcome, you know what I mean?

43
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,129
What's going on with Dad?

44
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,325
I don't know. He's been acting
strange ever since he got home.

45
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:05,268
Hey, Clark, football game on TV.
You want to watch it with me?

46
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,741
Don't you have work to do?

47
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,640
Chores can wait.

48
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,575
Besides-- Whoa!

49
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:17,274
I earned a rest. You can
pick up the slack for me, can't you?

50
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:21,152
Jonathan.

51
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:25,289
It's good to see this whole hero thing
didn't go to your head.

52
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:29,362
-Hope I'm not interrupting.
-Hi, Lex. Come in.

53
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,191
What's up, Lex?

54
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:35,695
-I'm looking for Mr. Kent.
-What do you want?

55
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,871
I heard you pulled my employee out of a car,
I wanted to see if you were okay.

56
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,874
No, you didn't. You wanted to see
if I was gonna sue you or not.

57
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:47,138
That would put an end to all
my financial difficulty, wouldn't it?

58
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:50,078
-Jonathan, that's enough.
-No, it's not enough, Martha.

59
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:52,151
You see, I don't like Lex Luthor...

60
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,777
...I don't like Lionel Luthor, and I don't
like your friendship with my son.

61
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:59,483
In fact, if all of you Luthors were to
dry up and die, I wouldn't shed a tear.

62
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,491
Dad, that's enough.

63
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,866
I think I'll take a nap.

64
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,507
Lex....

65
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:30,684
Wow. Drinking beer, mouthing off
and counter-macking with your mom?

66
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:34,055
Congratulations, Clark, your dad's
regressed back to being a teenager.

67
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:37,527
He's been under a lot of stress,
but I wonder if he's beginning to crack.

68
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,689
Who takes a three-hour nap
in the afternoon?

69
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,631
I don't know, but I still like
the part where he dissed Lex.

70
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,464
Why? What do you have against Lex?

71
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,573
Let's see. He screwed my family
out of the creamed-corn factory.

72
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,175
Well, that was 12 years ago.
And it was his father.

73
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:53,404
-I've never been crazy about him.
-Why haven't you said something?

74
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,514
I was hoping you'd see he was bad news.

75
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:57,014
What's your deepest desire?

76
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:59,516
If nothing was holding you back,
what would you do?

77
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:02,417
Hello, Chloe, nice to see you too.
What's up?

78
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,286
Principal Kwan thinks I need to get
in touch with the pulse of the student body.

79
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,920
So I've decided to do a poll. Now, if you
would both please do your statistical duty.

80
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,362
I'd go over and make out
with that girl right now.

81
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:17,800
You know, every answer I've gotten so
far has been either sex- or violence-related.

82
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:21,634
That's human nature, Chloe. Later.

83
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,236
Hi.

84
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,246
Did you know that Pete doesn't like Lex?

85
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,010
Yeah, he's totally jealous
of your friendship with him.

86
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:34,381
He feels you aren't
as close as you used to be.

87
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:35,544
Hey.

88
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,953
Hi.

89
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:40,958
What about you, Lana? Got one?

90
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,653
I would climb the windmill
out in Chandler's field.

91
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:47,892
Really? That's your deepest desire.

92
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,832
Somebody told me you could see
the Metropolis skyline from there.

93
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,666
I haven't got the guts
to climb up and see for myself.

94
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,673
Okay.

95
00:07:56,844 --> 00:08:00,177
-I can always make something up.
-No, it's good. It's good, I like it.

96
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:03,783
It's unleashing the inner Lana.

97
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,181
Okay.

98
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,982
Okay, Clark, you're up.

99
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:18,087
Clark. Remember, it's a PG-13 poll.

100
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:23,362
Since Whitney's dad has been in the hospital,
there's been a no-fly zone over Lana.

101
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:29,169
You know, there are other girls out there that
don't require crossing an emotional minefield.

102
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:33,344
But I can't just turn off my feelings for her.

103
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,539
You know, the choice is yours.

104
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:40,779
You can either sit in your loft
and play with your telescope, or move on.

105
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,798
-Hi.
-Hi.

106
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:59,769
What do you say you and I go up into
the hayloft and have us a little fun, huh?

107
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,536
Not now. Somebody's gotta
do some work around here.

108
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,442
Maybe you would like
to call Lex Luthor and apologize.

109
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:11,083
Why? All I did was tell him the truth.

110
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:15,187
I know I said you should let your feelings
out, but you're taking this too far.

111
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,289
What's wrong with you?

112
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,948
Nothing.

113
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:23,119
-I feel free.
-Well, you don't look well.

114
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:27,165
You're burning up. Why don't you go back
to bed. I'll make you soup when I get back.

115
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,097
Hey.

116
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:35,570
-I know a much better way to break a fever.
-Sweetheart, I have to go, really.

117
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,985
<i>This is the Kents, leave a message.</i>

118
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,246
<i>Jonathan, it's Jim Alexander
over at the bank.</i>

119
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:52,791
<i>I'm gonna be straight with you. I'm afraid
we're going to have to turn down your loan.</i>

120
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:56,060
Hello, Jim? Yeah, listen to me.

121
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,721
I have done nothing
but give back to this community...

122
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,561
...and all anyone has ever done
for me is screw me over.

123
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,532
So I'm gonna come down to that bank...

124
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:07,071
...and you are going to have to
turn my loan down right to my face.

125
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:12,178
That way I can see whether you have a pair
or whether your wife keeps them in a drawer.

126
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,054
Where did you learn to drive, you jerk?

127
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,223
Slow down!

128
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,537
Dad, what are you doing?

129
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,767
I've done nothing but give to this town,
and they screw me over.

130
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,105
They've pushed me too far,
and I'm pushing back.

131
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,304
Not with a shotgun.

132
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,939
-You gotta slow down. You're not thinking.
-I'm thinking just fine, son.

133
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,346
Now get out of my way!

134
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,696
Clark.

135
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:20,535
Dad.

136
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,040
Dad.

137
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:27,086
His symptoms indicate
a severe anaphylactic shock.

138
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:30,246
-But we can't detect any known antigens.
-What is it then?

139
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:34,417
Truth is, if he'd come in just yesterday,
I'd say I'd never seen anything like it.

140
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:37,689
But we admitted a car-crash victim
this morning, a James Beels?

141
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,456
Showed identical symptoms.

142
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,158
That's the guy Dad saved. How's he doing?

143
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,903
Not good.

144
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,633
He fell into a coma an hour ago.

145
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,184
Okay, so, what are we doing out here?

146
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:10,092
Mr. Kent and Mr. Beels both have the same
symptoms. This is the only place they've...

147
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:14,256
...been together, so I think what happened
to Mr. Kent was caused by something here.

148
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,527
-What are we looking for?
-Anything.

149
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:20,833
Wow. The debris starts from way
over there and ends over in that ditch.

150
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:23,909
That's some serious road rage.

151
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,536
I think I found something.

152
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,987
What you got?

153
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,130
Sorry.

154
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,429
That's all right. Let's get out of here.
This place is a dead end.

155
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:44,418
Gesundheit.

156
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:50,494
Seems you haven't been
completely honest with me, Dr. Hamilton.

157
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:55,193
I told you, it's under control.

158
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,302
Two men with an unexplained illness...

159
00:13:57,471 --> 00:14:01,066
...for which no one seems to know
the cure isn't my idea of under control.

160
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:05,473
I did a little research of my own into
your unauthorized botany experiment.

161
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:12,317
Apparently, in 1871 a strange contagion
struck the Morley settlement...

162
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,886
...and 200 people died almost overnight.

163
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,387
A priest who witnessed
the scene left a diary.

164
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:21,254
His last entries describe how
the settlers began acting out of character.

165
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:24,659
He claimed a local flower was to blame.

166
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:29,165
"On God's green earth,
this flower was the thief in the temple.

167
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:33,602
The silent temptress that, with a single
sneeze, brought out the basest instincts...

168
00:14:33,774 --> 00:14:36,242
...in men and drove them to violence."

169
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,435
That's been relegated
to folklore in scientific circles.

170
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:48,181
If you don't believe in this, you won't
mind if I lift the lid and smell the flower?

171
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:50,782
Why'd you bring it back?

172
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:54,222
These flowers were believed
to have toxins that, while deadly...

173
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,453
...might have other applications.

174
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,098
I'm not here to bankroll your pet projects.

175
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,961
I'm only interested in the meteors.

176
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,193
You wanted to know what they could do.

177
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,429
Putting people in the hospital
wasn't the plan.

178
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,470
Every discovery has their consequences.

179
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:12,169
If Jonathan Kent dies, you're gonna lose
something more valuable than your tenure.

180
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:15,974
Pack up a flower. I've got a team of
specialists in Metropolis to work on it.

181
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,314
-It's my research.
-I don't give a damn about your research.

182
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,784
I just want to find a cure.

183
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:57,051
Wow.

184
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,617
What's the occasion?

185
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:06,061
Nothing. I just thought
we'd blow off class today.

186
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:07,257
I....

187
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:08,958
I can't.

188
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,104
I'm barely keeping ahead,
and I gotta go to the store...

189
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,399
...and then run by the hospital
and see my dad.

190
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,407
You know what?
I am tired of your excuses.

191
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:23,447
Ever since your dad got sick,
you haven't been any fun at all.

192
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:25,744
I'm sorry, Lana, but it's kind of a big deal.

193
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,150
Whatever. I feel like I'm locked
in this relationship out of guilt.

194
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,519
Lana. What's wrong with you?

195
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,388
Nothing. I'm just not
keeping it inside anymore.

196
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:39,555
If that's how you feel, maybe
we need to reconsider this relationship.

197
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,693
Okay, fine.

198
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:46,065
It's over, Whitney.

199
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:53,440
-Hey, Jimmy.
-Oh, Lana.

200
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,081
Nice.

201
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:04,655
Not going to class, Clark?

202
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:07,793
I'm not really up...to it.

203
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:15,995
What's the matter?

204
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:21,038
Nothing. It's just a change.

205
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,177
You like it?

206
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,214
I think the operative word is "gulp."

207
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,981
Listen.

208
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,947
I know things are rough,
but you can't let them get you down.

209
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,858
It's kind of hard not to.

210
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:50,333
The key is to keep your mind off it.

211
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,937
Let your friends be your friends.

212
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,035
Let them distract you.

213
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,876
Trust them.

214
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:04,150
I do trust you, Lana.

215
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,515
Good.

216
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,120
Then follow me.

217
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,066
What are we doing in here?

218
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,828
It's quiet.

219
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,968
It's also completely...

220
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,572
...off-limits.

221
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,783
Lana, I don't think I'm really up for this.

222
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,617
You think too much, Clark.

223
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,823
Right now I'm thinking
you don't seem like yourself.

224
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,195
Or maybe...

225
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,205
...l'm more me than ever.

226
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:09,181
Lana, this is crazy.

227
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,873
That's the point.

228
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:16,717
If life doesn't make you crazy,
then why bother living it?

229
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,983
I know that's how I want it.

230
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,632
Question is:

231
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,707
Do you want what I want?

232
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,888
Lana!

233
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,654
Don't you want to come in, Clark?

234
00:19:57,831 --> 00:20:00,299
I don't think so.

235
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:18,007
I know you want me, Clark.

236
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:22,745
Just stop holding back. Come on.

237
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:27,559
You're not made of steel.
Or are you?

238
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,070
Wait.

239
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,406
Aren't you tired of waiting?

240
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,448
Need a little help warming up?

241
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:10,600
She just stripped down in front of you.
Lana Lang, in all her glory.

242
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,261
Most of her glory. Not that Kwan saw it.

243
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:17,205
Well, at least you'll have a nice picture
to daydream about in Saturday detention.

244
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:19,140
She said everything
I wanted to hear...

245
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,473
...but it didn't seem like she knew
what she was doing.

246
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:23,673
What do you think made Lana go soft-core?

247
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:25,846
First my dad, now Lana.

248
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:29,580
Yeah, and don't forget that Beels guy.
Remember the one that your dad helped?

249
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:32,418
You must have missed something
at the accident site.

250
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:35,083
No, I didn't.
Because I was there and I'm fine.

251
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,661
It just doesn't make any sense.

252
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:45,461
Wait. Looks like we weren't
the only ones out there.

253
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,162
Who's that?

254
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,171
I think it's Dr. Hamilton.

255
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:50,832
-The meteor freak?
-Yeah.

256
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,274
What's he doing
skulking around in the woods?

257
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:56,973
I don't know, but I have
a feeling it's not just a coincidence.

258
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,311
-I'm gonna go talk to him.
-I'm gonna go talk to Lana.

259
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:04,013
I think whatever happened
to my father is about to happen to her.

260
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,622
I want something better than progress.

261
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:12,924
I was just at the hospital,
they're getting worse.

262
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:18,426
Where have you been? Monique called
in sick, and we haven't got anyone to cover.

263
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:19,833
Why is this my problem?

264
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:23,407
Because Nell's in Metropolis
and you're the assistant manager.

265
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:27,012
Well, I'm taking the afternoon off,
so I guess we're closing early.

266
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:35,615
Listen up. We're closing early,
so coffee's on the house. Drink up.

267
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,217
I'll call back.

268
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,463
Lana.

269
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:53,572
The Talon closes at 9.

270
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:57,602
Not today.

271
00:22:57,777 --> 00:23:00,541
You're not impressing anyone
with the attitude, Lana.

272
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,614
You're talking to someone who
set the bar for adolescent rebellion.

273
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:09,346
That's right. I heard you were quite the bad
boy before you joined us here in Smallville.

274
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:10,750
It's nothing I'm proud of.

275
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:15,019
Please.
You don't really care about the Talon.

276
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:18,186
You only invested because I asked you to.

277
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,895
Now, why would you go
and do a thing like that?

278
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:30,540
The Luthors are famous
for their ulterior motives.

279
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,646
So tell me, Lex,
was it really about profit?

280
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:47,153
I'm not sure what this is, but it isn't
you, Lana. Are you feeling okay?

281
00:23:49,062 --> 00:23:51,189
Actually....

282
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:53,999
I'm a little nervous.

283
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:58,263
I might need some guidance, you know...

284
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:04,207
...from someone
with a little more experience.

285
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:08,144
What do you say, boss?

286
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:16,621
Lana, where have you been
in the last 24 hours?

287
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:19,286
It's none of your business.

288
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,154
What's your problem?

289
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,351
This isn't you.

290
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,429
Why, because I'm not
doing exactly as I'm told?

291
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:27,998
Because I'm not sitting
in a corner hiding in a book?

292
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,897
For once I'm not scared of life,
and no one can handle it...

293
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,538
...because you all prefer
the insecure little girl.

294
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:39,008
Well, I'm sick of her
and all her talk about her dead parents.

295
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:01,627
Lana!

296
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:13,075
<i>Dr. Hamilton, hello.
Chloe Sullivan, Smallville Torch.</i>

297
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:15,043
We spoke on the Internet
about the meteors?

298
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:16,203
Chloe.

299
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:19,645
Can you tell me what you were
doing in the woods last night?

300
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,654
What I do there most nights.

301
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:26,258
Search for meteor samples.
I find it easier to spot them with flashlights.

302
00:25:26,426 --> 00:25:28,417
So you didn't see me and my friend.

303
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:32,223
I heard voices, I saw flashlights,
I know that kids like to party...

304
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:34,559
...and as you know, I don't like company.

305
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:37,897
-You weren't looking at the accident scene?
-What accident?

306
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:46,140
I must be mistaken.
Sorry to have bothered you.

307
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:49,543
And what were you doing
in the woods last night?

308
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,206
Partying with my friends.

309
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:22,937
Lana, what's going on?
Does Lex know you have his car?

310
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,749
He should by now.

311
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:30,251
Something happened to you,
I just don't know what.

312
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:35,690
It's called self-confidence. For the first time,
I'm not repressing my feelings. I'm free.

313
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:36,886
No, you're not.

314
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,197
You should talk. You had me in the pool,
and you didn't take your chance.

315
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:44,302
I see the way you look at me.
Why don't you tell me how you feel?

316
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,802
Lana, you're sick.
I need to get you to a hospital.

317
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:49,908
Don't avoid the question, Clark.

318
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:52,476
Are you in love with me?

319
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:54,735
Lana....

320
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:58,179
Such a coward.
Can't even answer a simple question.

321
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:01,320
You want me? Come and get me.

322
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:02,886
Lana, stop!

323
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:06,991
What's the matter, Clark? Afraid of heights?

324
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,862
What are you doing? Come down!

325
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:17,625
Lana!

326
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,539
Lana!

327
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:34,174
Clark.

328
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:44,856
Coming through.

329
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,525
What happened?

330
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,395
She's got the
same symptoms as Dad and Beels.

331
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:56,407
How's Dad?

332
00:27:56,576 --> 00:28:01,946
He slipped into a coma.
The doctors don't know how long he'll last.

333
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:16,958
I've got doctors flying in from Metropolis.
I'm going to do everything I can for Mr. Kent.

334
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,435
Clark, I'm sorry.

335
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,982
It's not your fault, Lex.

336
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:58,598
<i>-Dr. Hamilton had a copy of this in his barn.
-Nicodemus Diary.</i>

337
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:01,399
It's a first-hand account
of Smallville's first mystery.

338
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:05,066
In 1871, the whole settlement went
postal before they even had a post office.

339
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,804
Nice to know Smallville was
whacked before the meteors.

340
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,881
Yeah. In the diary, they talk about a flower.

341
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,779
The settlers called it Nicodemus.

342
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:19,221
They said it liberated repressed feelings,
sent them into rages, then fever and finally--

343
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,089
Well....

344
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:26,662
Well, where can we find this flower?

345
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:28,197
You see, that's the glitch.

346
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,927
After the massacre,
the cavalry torched the settlement.

347
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,503
They didn't want
whatever caused it to spread.

348
00:29:33,673 --> 00:29:35,470
The flower's been extinct for 100 years.

349
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,768
How is Hamilton involved in this?
He's a geologist.

350
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,001
With a meteor fixation.

351
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:41,908
We tracked down this paper
he wrote six years ago.

352
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:45,539
-Metropolis University Press.
-I think this is the last straw.

353
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:50,781
In it, he postulates that meteor rocks
can be used to irradiate dormant plant cells.

354
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,390
So you think Hamilton
brought back the Nicodemus.

355
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,460
-And now he's trying to cover it up.
-Let's go talk to him.

356
00:29:56,629 --> 00:30:01,692
<i>Wait, there's more. Dr. Hamilton didn't
check out The Nicodemus Diary. Lex did.</i>

357
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:03,828
You think he's involved?

358
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,971
I told you all along he was bad news.

359
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,799
Pete, we don't know anything yet.

360
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:14,376
Good.

361
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:21,544
I'll call back. I just got off the phone with
the doctors. They've isolated the problem.

362
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:26,322
Does it have to do with
the Nicodemus flower?

363
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,687
I know you checked
the diary out of the library.

364
00:30:29,762 --> 00:30:31,957
-Yes, I did, Clark.
-Why?

365
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:35,828
Because my property was built on
the site of the original settlement.

366
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:39,061
I always thought it was an interesting story.
When I heard about your dad...

367
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:42,503
-...I tracked it down to see if it could help.
-Why didn't you tell me?

368
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:46,711
Clark, it's a crackpot story.
I was grasping at straws.

369
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:49,245
-Do you know Dr. Steven Hamilton?
-Who's that?

370
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:51,542
Don't lie to me!

371
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:54,047
Clark, calm down.

372
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,013
I know you're worried
about your dad and Lana...

373
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,124
...but I checked the book
out of the library, that's it.

374
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:06,631
I'm not responsible for what happened, and
I'm doing everything in my power to fix it.

375
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,289
That's the truth, Clark.

376
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,368
Okay, keep your flashlight low.

377
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:21,074
You're an expert on breaking
and entering now?

378
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:28,309
Be careful!

379
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,805
Pete, what happened?

380
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:53,638
Pete? You okay?

381
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:01,949
Pete?

382
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:08,483
-You looking for me?
-Oh, no.

383
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:10,822
Do you have any idea how beautiful you are?

384
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:16,263
Okay, Pete, you've been infected.
We've gotta get you to the hospital.

385
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:21,202
That's right.
Ignore Pete, he's just the funny guy.

386
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:24,867
You don't sweat his feelings,
because you've got eyes for Clark.

387
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:28,343
Calm down, Pete.
I'm going to call Clark.

388
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:33,979
He's probably hanging out with
his new best friend, Lex Luthor.

389
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:47,629
Give me your keys.

390
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,324
Why, where are you going?

391
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:56,403
I'm serious, Chloe.

392
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,338
Give me the damn keys!

393
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:21,688
How is he?

394
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:24,492
Not good.

395
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:29,563
Clark, Mr. Beels died half an hour ago.

396
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:43,779
With all my abilities,
there's nothing I can do.

397
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:47,384
What will we do if Dad--?

398
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,322
I don't know.

399
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:59,331
Did I ever tell you about
the first time I ever saw him?

400
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:03,431
No.

401
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:09,847
He came to Metropolis U to take a finance
course, and he was sitting by a fountain...

402
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:12,916
...all denim and flannel, eating an apple.

403
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:15,280
And I asked to borrow his notes.

404
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:20,414
He didn't know that I was
the note-taker for the class. He still doesn't.

405
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,324
You're sly, Mom.

406
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:28,992
He was so cute.

407
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:35,362
So I asked him for his notes,
and he just handed over his notebook...

408
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:37,873
...without even asking my name, and I said:

409
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:41,604
"How can you be sure I'll bring it back?"
And he said:

410
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:45,477
"I prefer to believe in people."

411
00:34:46,986 --> 00:34:48,715
It sounds like Dad.

412
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:51,856
And I remember looking at him,
completely embarrassed...

413
00:34:52,024 --> 00:34:56,222
...because I was thinking the dumbest thing.
I was thinking:

414
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:58,363
"God, I hope he marries me."

415
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,128
I still think that.

416
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,363
Every day there's a part of me that says,
"God, I hope he marries me."

417
00:35:17,016 --> 00:35:21,112
I'm sorry, Mrs. Kent.
Can I talk to you for a second, Clark?

418
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,550
Go.

419
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,831
I'm so sorry.

420
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:39,232
Dr. Hamilton was lying.
I found the Nicodemus flower in the barn.

421
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:41,737
One got Pete,
and he took a quick turn to scary.

422
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,636
-Where'd he go?
-He grabbed a gun...

423
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,902
...and he said he was going after Lex.

424
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:55,983
This flower has existed for--
For hundreds of years.

425
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:59,647
Now, the Native Americans must have
developed some sort of herbal antidote...

426
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,656
...and these are the instructions.

427
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:04,091
-Where'd you find it?
-Collecting dust in a museum.

428
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:08,427
-It's a one of a kind, so they want it back.
-I'll get it to my team in Metropolis.

429
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,862
Nobody's going anywhere.

430
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,032
Pete.

431
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:16,634
What are you doing here?

432
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:23,038
I knew you were behind this. You pretended
to be Clark's friend, but you're not.

433
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:28,548
And now his dad's gonna die.
Because of you.

434
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,052
-What's this about?
-Do not pretend you don't know.

435
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:32,451
I went to your barn!

436
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:34,592
He's infected.

437
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,218
Pete, we have the cure.
We're going to make everyone better.

438
00:36:38,397 --> 00:36:42,390
You're nothing but a liar. Clark can't see it,
but I can. And now you're gonna pay.

439
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:43,557
No!

440
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:54,470
Pete, if that book is destroyed,
you and Lana and Mr. Kent will all die.

441
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:55,635
You're lying.

442
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:57,111
Pete, I want to help you.

443
00:36:57,282 --> 00:37:00,581
You don't want to help anybody but yourself!

444
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:03,653
You come to town and suddenly
you're Clark's new best friend!

445
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,693
-I thought he was a good judge of character.
-Lex, the book?

446
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:14,464
Pete, I'm going to reach in there
and grab that book.

447
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,100
If you want to shoot me...

448
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:20,503
...go ahead.

449
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:22,765
No problem.

450
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:28,807
Get out.

451
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:37,279
Say goodbye, Lex.

452
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:40,050
Pete! Don't do it.

453
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,920
We used to be best friends.

454
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:46,121
His dad screwed over my dad, and now
he's trying to screw up things between us.

455
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:48,664
The world's a better place without him.

456
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:50,301
Pete, put the gun down.

457
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:54,405
He's behind all this. I saw Hamilton here.

458
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:57,840
They're working on this together!

459
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,741
-Is that true?
-Clark. He's delusional.

460
00:38:01,914 --> 00:38:06,351
I don't believe you. You're right,
Pete, he's been lying to everyone.

461
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,179
I know who my true friends are.

462
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:09,684
I knew you'd see the light.

463
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:16,386
Clark, what are you doing?

464
00:38:16,562 --> 00:38:18,496
Can't talk your way out of this one, Lex.

465
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:21,792
I see you how you really are.
The friendship is over.

466
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:28,095
Nice one.

467
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:30,503
I'll finish him.

468
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,675
How'd you do that?

469
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:37,713
Don't worry, Pete,
we'll get you to the hospital.

470
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,780
Clark, what the hell?

471
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:49,189
I'm sorry, Lex.

472
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,626
So that was an act?

473
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:56,597
I didn't know what else to do.
He was gonna shoot you.

474
00:38:57,436 --> 00:39:00,599
You had me for a moment.
I thought you were serious.

475
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:03,536
What do they feed you on that farm?

476
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:06,476
Was Hamilton really here?

477
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:10,047
What do you think, Clark?

478
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,226
Morning, sleepyhead.

479
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:31,964
Dad, you're okay.

480
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:38,098
Yeah. Clark.
Clark, what am I doing here?

481
00:39:38,277 --> 00:39:41,474
Jonathan! Oh, sweetheart!

482
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,842
-Martha.
-Oh, sweetheart!

483
00:39:44,016 --> 00:39:47,918
The doctors in Metropolis found a cure last
night. It was an old Native American remedy.

484
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:50,520
-How are Pete and Lana?
-They're already up.

485
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:54,816
-Dad, do you remember anything?
-No.

486
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:59,259
-The doctors think it's because of the fever.
-Trust me, it's better that way.

487
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:02,730
-Come on, what are you talking about?
-Oh, sweetheart.

488
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:09,099
Dr. Hamilton, hello?

489
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,460
-What'd you do with my lab?
-Destroyed it.

490
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:37,795
-How dare you!
-You're lucky you found a cure...

491
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:40,096
...and nobody infected
can remember anything.

492
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:41,534
But people are talking.

493
00:40:41,707 --> 00:40:45,199
Beels worked for my father,
and then there's Chloe Sullivan.

494
00:40:45,377 --> 00:40:47,538
I'm sensing this relationship is over.

495
00:40:47,713 --> 00:40:53,345
No, doctor, I think you're very talented.
You just need closer supervision.

496
00:40:54,086 --> 00:40:57,522
I recently acquired a small
research facility outside Metropolis.

497
00:40:57,689 --> 00:41:01,420
Cadmus Labs? I'm gonna hide you out there.

498
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:06,253
Remember, Lex,
you're the one opening Pandora's box.

499
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:09,332
I'm just the key, Dr. Hamilton.

500
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:25,344
Okay, open your eyes, Lana.

501
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,716
There's Metropolis.

502
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,682
It's beautiful.

503
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,823
I can't believe we're up here.

504
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:43,095
It's actually getting down which
is gonna be the interesting part.

505
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:48,129
It's good to have you back, Lana.

506
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:55,845
I spent the entire day apologizing to
the Talon staff and to Lex and to Whitney.

507
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:59,381
I just wish I could remember what happened.

508
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,951
It sounds like
I got a little out of control there.

509
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:07,820
You spoke your mind, and you did what
you wanted. Kind of an alpha Lana.

510
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:14,093
I couldn't believe what I was wearing.

511
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,392
I kind of liked it.

512
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:27,607
I didn't say or do anything embarrassing
to you that I should know about...

513
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:29,610
...did I?

514
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:35,412
No.

515
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:41,453
Good. Good.

516
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:45,093
So how does it feel
to be on top of the world?

517
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,799
Or at least Smallville?

518
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,002
I feel free.

519
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:02,028
