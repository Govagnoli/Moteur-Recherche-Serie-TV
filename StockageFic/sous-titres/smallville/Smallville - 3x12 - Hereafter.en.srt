1
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,535
Good run, everybody.
Don't forget to stretch it out.

2
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:18,300
Mr. Altman.

3
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:22,706
I wanted to come by.

4
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:25,475
If there's anything I can do....

5
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:29,246
There's nothing that any
of us can do now.

6
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:33,353
She really loved this time of year.

7
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,427
You were really focused out there...

8
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:47,060
...speaking as one
of the dozens you passed.

9
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,907
-I'm Lana.
-Jordan Cross.

10
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:53,704
I just started here a couple days ago.

11
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:17,632
-Sorry.
-No, it's okay.

12
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:20,601
There's a lot more where that came from.

13
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:26,741
Hey. Nice job out there today.
When are you gonna join--?

14
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:36,486
--the team?

15
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:37,747
You all right?

16
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,834
Jordan.

17
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:53,164
The totally overwhelmed look
gave you away.

18
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:54,669
I'm Clark.

19
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,274
Right. The mentor guy. Hi.

20
00:02:57,442 --> 00:03:01,037
We were supposed to meet in the gym.
They said you bolted. Is everything okay?

21
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:04,842
I'm still getting used to all these people.
I was home schooled up until now.

22
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:08,145
Allow me to be your lifeline.
All new students are assigned a mentor...

23
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,585
...mostly because they have a map.
Here's the lay of the land.

24
00:03:11,757 --> 00:03:14,351
Would you mind if l
checked with my dad?

25
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,225
Sure.

26
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:31,303
It happened again, didn't it?

27
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:34,274
Jordan, I know how much
you want this to work...

28
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:36,937
...but I still think it's a mistake.

29
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:47,025
No. Not today.

30
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:52,125
-Don't be today.
-Jordan.

31
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:01,063
-Mr. Altman? Are you okay?
-Why did you stop me?

32
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:05,403
I just wanted to be with my little girl.

33
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:10,070
My daughter is dead, and it is my fault.

34
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:27,788
Megan, could you go and ask the nurse
if Mr. Altman's ready for visitors?

35
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:32,294
How's Mr. Altman?

36
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:34,091
He's pretty heavily sedated.

37
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:37,963
They want to keep him here
until they can do a full psych evaluation.

38
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,306
I didn't know you and Megan
knew Mr. Altman so well.

39
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:45,367
It's really through his daughter.

40
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:48,570
We were all in the cheerleading squad
back in junior high.

41
00:05:49,147 --> 00:05:51,741
Mr. Altman was never the same
after she got hurt.

42
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:56,251
-I remember she was hit by a car.
-Walking home from our end-of-season party.

43
00:05:56,755 --> 00:06:00,748
The doctors said there was
no chance for recovery....

44
00:06:00,926 --> 00:06:03,827
But Mr. Altman
kept hoping for a miracle.

45
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:06,761
It sounds like that never came.

46
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:10,296
He took her off life support last month.

47
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:13,803
I wouldn't wish that decision on anyone.

48
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,311
It's hard when you blame yourself
for everything that happened.

49
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,141
I'd better go.

50
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:38,329
If I could change that night, I would.

51
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:43,798
I don't even remember
why Julia and I were fighting.

52
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:46,632
Megan, don't do this.

53
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:51,868
Julia left that night
because she was mad at me.

54
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:56,180
If I had just stopped her....

55
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:58,643
I wish I'd gone after her too, but....

56
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:02,617
You know, neither of us could have known
what was going to happen.

57
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:05,551
You can't keep blaming yourself.

58
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:09,554
I should've told him then.

59
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:13,421
He's under sedation.

60
00:07:13,798 --> 00:07:16,392
I'm not sure he's even hearing you.

61
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:23,006
Come on. Let's go.

62
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:27,272
I'm so sorry.

63
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:21,694
Hey, Jordan, it's just me.

64
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:24,425
Yeah. Hi.

65
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:27,128
I'm sorry for dropping
the mentor ball yesterday.

66
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:29,603
Mr. Altman's lucky you were there.

67
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:31,605
I just wish my dad hadn't seen it.

68
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:35,774
Just tell him that Smallville High
is rarely that exciting.

69
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:40,077
Trust me, my parents wrote the book
on being overprotective. You'll be fine.

70
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:44,546
-You all right?
-Yeah. I just don't like being touched.

71
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:46,750
Fair enough.

72
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:01,964
What?

73
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,667
Nothing. You just had
that look yesterday...

74
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:09,371
...just before Mr. Altman
jumped in front of the car.

75
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:13,178
It's almost like you knew
he was gonna do something.

76
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:15,182
I need some air.

77
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:33,531
-Good night.
-Bye, Lana.

78
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:39,509
Get it off me!

79
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:41,178
It burns!

80
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:52,313
Get it off!

81
00:09:55,393 --> 00:09:58,123
It hurts! It burns!

82
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,391
Adam, are you all right?

83
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:03,896
Adam, wake up.

84
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:06,000
Get off!

85
00:10:12,077 --> 00:10:14,238
Lana.

86
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:17,470
What happened? Are you okay?

87
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,776
I'm fine.

88
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:22,943
You were having a king-sized nightmare.

89
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,250
I guess.

90
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:32,794
Do you want to talk about it?

91
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:36,558
To be honest, no, not really.

92
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:47,644
I'll put some clothes on,
clean up this mess.

93
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:56,245
Clark, we've been looking
all over for you.

94
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:58,548
-Who gets to do the honors?
-What's going on?

95
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:01,317
Ready to hear the latest news
about Lana's houseguest?

96
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:03,654
Actually, no.

97
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:06,354
"No" as in you're not interested?

98
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:09,091
No. "No" as in it's none of my business.

99
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:12,862
Lana and I finally reset
our relationship to the friendship level.

100
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:16,063
I'm not gonna blow it
by getting between her and Adam.

101
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:20,809
Clark's taking one for the team.

102
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:23,311
From now on, consider me
an Adam-free zone.

103
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:26,779
Okay. Now that we can
scratch gossip off the discussion list...

104
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:28,384
...what's next on the agenda?

105
00:11:30,822 --> 00:11:34,053
What have you guys heard
about that new kid, Jordan Cross?

106
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:37,226
You mean,
Mr. Pathologically-Afraid-of-Human-Contact?

107
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:42,089
I guess he made quite a first impression.
Look, this is gonna sound crazy...

108
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:45,065
...but I think he had a premonition
about Mr. Altman.

109
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:46,601
What made you take that leap?

110
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,404
Let's call it a gut feeling.

111
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:52,372
-Maybe that's the same thing Jordan had.
-What do you mean?

112
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:55,513
Some people believe premonitions
are just heightened intuition.

113
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,013
Maybe he overheard something
or saw a look in Altman's eyes.

114
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:02,779
But given your past with Wall of Weirdness,
we should look into it.

115
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,084
-Thanks.
-No thanks required.

116
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:09,886
It's kind of fun being Woodward
to your Bernstein again.

117
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:21,269
-Lana, come in.
-Your message said it was important.

118
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:24,533
-ls something wrong?
-I was hoping you could tell me.

119
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:28,435
I understand there was an incident
at the Talon last night.

120
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:31,682
Apparently some neighbors
heard your tenant screaming?

121
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:36,952
I think that "incident"
is a pretty strong word.

122
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:40,519
Adam had a bad dream, that's all.
It's no big deal.

123
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:43,786
If it had been the first time,
I'd probably agree with you.

124
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:46,362
-What do you mean?
-I can read an invoice.

125
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,394
Let's see.

126
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:53,969
Charges for repairing broken windows...

127
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:56,333
...replacing furniture...

128
00:12:56,507 --> 00:13:00,273
...all in the last week.
Is there a reason why you didn't tell me?

129
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:02,470
Maybe I thought
you'd jump to conclusions.

130
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:04,842
You have to admit,
Adam's behavior is unusual.

131
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:13,851
And when you're on the rebound, your
emotions can outweigh your common sense.

132
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:16,493
Look, this isn't personal.

133
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:18,720
Adam's been a real help
around the Talon.

134
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:22,560
Putting up with a few nightmares
is a small price to pay.

135
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:26,565
Look, it's your call...

136
00:13:26,738 --> 00:13:30,105
...but at the very least,
you should be asking yourself...

137
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:32,766
...how much do you really know
about your new friend?

138
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:33,300
Chloe, I think I found something.

139
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,837
Yeah? You and me both.

140
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:39,340
I just had a mega-Real World
moment with Ad--

141
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,910
Never mind. Sorry.

142
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,880
Anyway, looks like you're hammering away
at the Jordan story.

143
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,211
Yes. I pulled this off the Ledger database.

144
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:49,910
Apparently when Jordan was six...

145
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:53,922
...he went ballistic outside a roller coaster,
screaming someone was gonna be killed.

146
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:57,960
He dad pulled him away, but when they
started the ride, one of the cars broke loose.

147
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:01,189
Killing the woman
standing in line with him.

148
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:04,529
Mr. Altman wasn't
Jordan's first premonition.

149
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:07,034
All right, well, cue the spooky music...

150
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:10,140
...because Jordan was born
on the day of the meteor shower.

151
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:15,311
I took a quick trip to the courthouse and
asked them to pull anything about Cross.

152
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,416
According to this, Jordan's mother
died shortly after he was born...

153
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:22,747
...as a result of a direct hit
from a meteor?

154
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,889
As one life ends, another begins.

155
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:28,192
Well, that must be the connection.

156
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:32,056
Yeah. Mix that with meteor rocks,
and you could be in John Edward territory.

157
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:37,064
-No, get away from me.
-Megan, please.

158
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:39,934
-This can't be good.
-Listen to me for one second.

159
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:41,435
Megan, please!

160
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:42,903
That's Jordan.

161
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:44,866
-Stop it!
-You don't understand!

162
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:46,374
-I'm trying to help you!
-Go away!

163
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:47,909
Megan, stop!

164
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,048
Please, I'm just asking you
to let me walk you home.

165
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:53,943
You don't understand!
It's not what you think!

166
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:56,153
Leave me alone!

167
00:15:57,221 --> 00:15:58,950
-What's going on?
-I have to help her!

168
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:01,057
Why? Calm down!
What'll happen to her?

169
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:03,351
She's going to die, Clark.

170
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:05,360
Don't you understand?

171
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:08,495
She's going to die.

172
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:29,017
Jordan, hold up!

173
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,784
My father was right, Clark.

174
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:33,082
This was a mistake.

175
00:16:33,324 --> 00:16:35,485
I should've never come to school.

176
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,150
Jordan...

177
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:38,386
...I believe you.

178
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:42,060
You saw something when you
touched Megan, didn't you?

179
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:45,031
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Like a premonition?

180
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:47,000
I don't know what you're talking about!

181
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:49,366
I know about the roller coaster.

182
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,008
When you touched Megan,
what'd you see?

183
00:16:55,713 --> 00:16:57,544
I saw fire.

184
00:16:57,715 --> 00:16:59,376
Smoke.

185
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,108
Megan was screaming.

186
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:03,416
She couldn't breathe.

187
00:17:04,188 --> 00:17:06,088
Clark, I had to warn her.

188
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:11,422
Maybe we still can.

189
00:17:13,564 --> 00:17:16,556
Megan's house is just around the corner.

190
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:20,431
These visions, when they hit,
what are they like?

191
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:23,273
It's hard to describe.

192
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,407
It's like a curtain's being pulled back...

193
00:17:26,577 --> 00:17:29,876
...just long enough for me
to see the moment they die.

194
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:34,975
Have you ever been able to stop
a vision from coming true?

195
00:17:35,153 --> 00:17:36,677
Never.

196
00:17:36,854 --> 00:17:40,915
My dad and I did everything we could.
We called the police, the paramedics...

197
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:43,788
...begged people to take us seriously.

198
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:46,589
But no matter what we did,
the visions always came true.

199
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:50,131
That's how you knew
Mr. Altman was gonna kill himself.

200
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:51,825
Except he survived.

201
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:54,271
Because of you.

202
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:56,905
How did you do it?

203
00:17:57,441 --> 00:18:01,207
I had a vision of you too,
when you grabbed me in the hallway.

204
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,609
What do you mean? What'd you see?

205
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:07,642
Like, you don't have an end
like other people.

206
00:18:07,818 --> 00:18:10,514
It's like you live forever.

207
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:14,816
Come on, Jordan, you're wrong.

208
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:16,792
No.

209
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:19,589
Maybe that's why you were able
to save Mr. Altman.

210
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:22,961
Nobody's ever been able to stop
one of the deaths before.

211
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:25,830
Maybe you can do it again for Megan.

212
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,401
Excuse me.

213
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,209
Mr. Kent.

214
00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:35,777
Why am I not surprised?

215
00:18:35,947 --> 00:18:39,178
-Sheriff, what's happening?
-We just found Megan Calder's car...

216
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,045
...abandoned off the main highway.

217
00:18:41,852 --> 00:18:43,342
There were signs of a struggle.

218
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:46,180
Are you Jordan Cross?

219
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:52,690
I'm told you got into an argument
with Miss Calder today.

220
00:18:54,198 --> 00:18:58,567
-I was there, sheriff. It wasn't a big deal.
-I got a missing girl, Mr. Kent.

221
00:18:58,736 --> 00:19:00,363
That makes everything a big deal.

222
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,970
We'd better talk.

223
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:19,050
It's a little early for your second
triple cap, isn't it?

224
00:19:19,223 --> 00:19:21,953
Actually, I came to talk
to you about something.

225
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:26,222
-ls Adam around?
-I don't know. I haven't seen him in a while.

226
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:28,262
You okay?

227
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,236
Well, I'm just having one of those
"it sucks to be a reporter" days.

228
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,936
I know you and Adam have been spending
a lot of time together, but....

229
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:43,607
Chloe, what's wrong?

230
00:19:53,724 --> 00:19:58,855
They say music hath charms
to soothe the savage breast.

231
00:19:59,163 --> 00:20:01,529
Don't count on it.

232
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,965
You play?

233
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:07,366
I never really had the patience for it.

234
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:11,338
My parents would have killed
for a piano like this.

235
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:16,275
I wound up learning
on a second-hand junker.

236
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:19,382
It doesn't seem to have hurt your playing.

237
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,577
It's one of Rachmaninoff's
most complicated pieces.

238
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:26,713
You didn't ask me here
to discuss music theory.

239
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:29,590
No.

240
00:20:30,328 --> 00:20:31,727
I thought we should meet.

241
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,892
-lf it's about the lamp, I'll replace it.
-It's your behavior that concerns me, Adam.

242
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:41,601
-Lana's a friend.
-For what it's worth...

243
00:20:41,772 --> 00:20:43,603
...we both care about Lana.

244
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:50,238
-What's this?
-Your colorful past.

245
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,745
These are my school records.

246
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:58,218
-They're supposed to be sealed.
-I'm not sure why you'd care.

247
00:20:58,389 --> 00:20:59,913
They're exemplary.

248
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:02,753
Straight A's across the board.

249
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:07,220
-I was always a good student.
-Actually, I spoke with your teachers.

250
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:10,094
I believe the phrases they used were...

251
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:14,567
..."a fine pupil" and "a joy to teach."

252
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:16,832
It's nice to be appreciated.

253
00:21:17,007 --> 00:21:19,339
The strange thing is...

254
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:21,709
...they all said it.

255
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:24,973
Word for word. Almost as if
they were told what to say.

256
00:21:29,453 --> 00:21:31,512
Don't worry, Adam.

257
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:32,781
I'll keep checking.

258
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:38,653
We all have black marks
somewhere in our past.

259
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,669
Jordan.

260
00:21:53,677 --> 00:21:55,042
Are you all right?

261
00:21:55,212 --> 00:21:56,474
I had another vision.

262
00:21:56,947 --> 00:21:58,847
I thought I could help.

263
00:21:59,016 --> 00:22:01,177
It's okay. Clark knows.

264
00:22:02,753 --> 00:22:05,051
-Wait for me in the truck.
-Dad, please.

265
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,691
Jordan.

266
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:13,026
Excuse me.

267
00:22:13,197 --> 00:22:14,755
Mr. Cross.

268
00:22:15,232 --> 00:22:18,201
Jordan really wants
to make a go of it at school.

269
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:22,328
-Would you give him one more chance?
-I really appreciate all you've done, Clark...

270
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:24,531
...but Jordan is...

271
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:28,610
...special. If he's at home,
at least I can try to protect him.

272
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,875
Jordan.

273
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:33,879
Oh, my God. Jordan!

274
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:38,812
Jordan!

275
00:22:43,894 --> 00:22:45,919
I got your message.

276
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,460
In case, you didn't notice, school's out.

277
00:22:48,632 --> 00:22:51,294
I was at the Torch doing some research.

278
00:22:54,638 --> 00:22:57,198
Adam, there's no easy way to ask this...

279
00:22:57,374 --> 00:23:01,037
...but somebody found your needle
in the trash today.

280
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:02,975
Technically, that's not a question.

281
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:06,344
Look, I'm trying to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

282
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:08,451
Are you diabetic?

283
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:10,086
On some sort of medication?

284
00:23:10,287 --> 00:23:13,723
Was that the research you were doing?
That would explain it...

285
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:17,224
...except diabetics leave their syringes
with the school nurse.

286
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:20,659
Believe me, I am not trying
to accuse you of anything.

287
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:23,459
Yes, you are. You think I'm on drugs.

288
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:25,835
The truth is, you don't trust me.

289
00:23:26,003 --> 00:23:27,766
Never have.

290
00:23:27,938 --> 00:23:29,405
That's not fair.

291
00:23:29,573 --> 00:23:32,337
You said you'd always be honest
with me. Why not now?

292
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,810
Look, I want this to work,
but if you're not sure, just say the word.

293
00:23:36,981 --> 00:23:38,608
I'm gone.

294
00:23:58,068 --> 00:24:00,059
Adam!

295
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,604
Jordan.

296
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:09,439
-Are you okay?
-Fine.

297
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,677
-What are you doing here?
-Hiding from my father.

298
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:16,820
I think he wants to pull me out of school.

299
00:24:17,254 --> 00:24:19,381
Running away isn't going to fix things--

300
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:39,701
It's changed.

301
00:24:41,378 --> 00:24:44,711
-Jordan, what is it?
-Lana, please, don't leave here.

302
00:24:44,915 --> 00:24:46,712
-What's going on?
-I can't explain it.

303
00:24:46,884 --> 00:24:50,251
Something awful's about to happen.
We have to go find Clark!

304
00:24:50,487 --> 00:24:52,045
Clark? Wait--

305
00:24:52,222 --> 00:24:53,814
What are you doing?

306
00:25:15,012 --> 00:25:16,946
Adam?

307
00:25:19,283 --> 00:25:21,217
Hello?

308
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:02,550
Last I heard, breaking and entering
was still against the law.

309
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,460
I could say the same thing to you.

310
00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:07,927
Except I own the place.

311
00:26:09,466 --> 00:26:12,094
I take it you have some concerns
about Lana's new friend?

312
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:14,965
I think that's pretty obvious.

313
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:18,099
So what caused you to go
all cloak and dagger?

314
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:22,268
Rachmaninoff.

315
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:26,712
When Adam came to see me today, he was
playing one of his most difficult pieces.

316
00:26:26,884 --> 00:26:28,818
Is that a crime?

317
00:26:28,986 --> 00:26:31,784
No CDs, sheet music...

318
00:26:31,955 --> 00:26:34,116
...not even a radio.

319
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:39,652
According to his transcripts,
he never took a single music class.

320
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:44,199
So computers, kickboxing
and a master pianist.

321
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:47,034
Adam's a regular Renaissance man.

322
00:26:47,638 --> 00:26:49,765
Like you said, that isn't a crime.

323
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:52,798
Though it certainly piqued your interest.

324
00:26:55,345 --> 00:26:57,074
Lock up on your way out.

325
00:27:18,502 --> 00:27:20,265
Clark!

326
00:27:20,437 --> 00:27:24,464
Clark, you've been looking for Jordan
all over town. Time to call it a night.

327
00:27:24,641 --> 00:27:26,370
I was supposed to help him fit in.

328
00:27:26,543 --> 00:27:29,444
I took him to a crime scene.
I put him on the sheriff's radar.

329
00:27:29,613 --> 00:27:33,105
-That is not your fault.
-Well, he was better off before he met me.

330
00:27:33,283 --> 00:27:38,118
Clark, if he ran away, it's because he didn't
feel like he had anybody at home to talk to.

331
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:41,652
-His dad seemed like a good man.
-I'm sure he is.

332
00:27:41,825 --> 00:27:45,784
And I'm also sure he feels like
he's doing the best thing for Jordan.

333
00:27:48,198 --> 00:27:49,825
Look, when--

334
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,764
When your son has a gift...

335
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:58,199
...your first temptation is to hide him away,
to shelter him from everything.

336
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:00,400
You didn't.

337
00:28:01,578 --> 00:28:03,375
I sure as hell wanted to.

338
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:08,216
Look, your mother convinced me
you needed to experience the whole world...

339
00:28:08,385 --> 00:28:11,843
...not just this farm.

340
00:28:12,623 --> 00:28:15,114
Ultimately, she was right.

341
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:20,756
So Jordan will come home...

342
00:28:20,931 --> 00:28:22,660
...but not until he's good and ready.

343
00:28:24,568 --> 00:28:26,035
-Okay?
-Yeah.

344
00:28:27,671 --> 00:28:30,902
All right, why don't you come on inside,
grab a bite to eat.

345
00:28:31,074 --> 00:28:33,338
I'll be there in a second.

346
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,205
Okay.

347
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:51,159
-Clark.
-Jordan, what happened to you?

348
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,661
I was in school with Lana when somebody
attacked us. They took her!

349
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:58,165
-Who took her?
-I don't know! I didn't see him.

350
00:28:58,635 --> 00:29:00,569
Clark, I had another vision of Lana.

351
00:29:00,737 --> 00:29:03,604
-What do you mean, "another"?
-I'm not sure.

352
00:29:03,774 --> 00:29:07,437
The other day, she touched my hand
on the track. It was okay.

353
00:29:08,145 --> 00:29:11,410
She was peaceful. She was old.
It was her time.

354
00:29:11,615 --> 00:29:15,278
-You're saying that's changed?
-She was trapped in a fire, just like Megan!

355
00:29:15,452 --> 00:29:17,886
Okay, okay, calm down.
What else did you see?

356
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:23,220
Stuff on the floor, photos burning.

357
00:29:23,627 --> 00:29:28,030
Lana and Megan were in one, but they were
younger. They were in cheerleading outfits.

358
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,532
Is this the girl?

359
00:29:33,704 --> 00:29:34,796
Mr. Altman's daughter.

360
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:40,403
When I saved him, I changed everything...

361
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:43,375
...even what's supposed
to happen to Lana.

362
00:29:44,014 --> 00:29:47,108
Did you see anything
that might tell us where she is?

363
00:29:47,284 --> 00:29:49,878
-There was an old sign inside.
-What did it say?

364
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,981
-lt said "Wandering Hills."
-I know where that is.

365
00:29:54,358 --> 00:29:55,916
-Clark, take me with you.
-No way.

366
00:29:56,093 --> 00:30:00,427
I've seen the house.
Maybe I can help you find it. Please.

367
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:04,699
First sign of trouble, you back off.

368
00:30:04,868 --> 00:30:06,335
Let's go.

369
00:30:11,608 --> 00:30:14,509
Mr. Altman, why are you doing this?

370
00:30:15,345 --> 00:30:17,176
Please, you don't have to do this!

371
00:30:17,581 --> 00:30:21,813
-You're gonna pay for what you did to Julia.
-What are you talking about?

372
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:25,711
I heard you at the hospital.
Megan had a fight with her...

373
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:28,915
...and you let her leave.
You should have looked out for her.

374
00:30:29,092 --> 00:30:31,959
-We didn't cause the accident.
-You might as well have.

375
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:34,620
My little girl was out there
all alone because of you!

376
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:36,765
It wasn't our fault!

377
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:39,494
For years, I blamed myself
for not being there--

378
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,570
Coach, this is not the way.

379
00:30:41,872 --> 00:30:45,239
Now I know I wasn't responsible.

380
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:48,707
-You two killed her.
-No, we di--

381
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,645
-Please!
-No. No!

382
00:30:56,453 --> 00:30:58,978
Coach, don't! No!

383
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:11,796
Help!

384
00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:19,568
Help us!

385
00:31:21,244 --> 00:31:23,144
Please!

386
00:31:39,062 --> 00:31:40,859
Clark, look!

387
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:45,362
-Jordan, stay in the car.
-He's got them both. You'll need help.

388
00:31:45,535 --> 00:31:47,264
Stay in the car, Jordan.

389
00:31:58,448 --> 00:32:00,177
Lana?

390
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,011
-Lana.
-Save Megan.

391
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:03,844
Get out.

392
00:32:11,862 --> 00:32:13,352
Jordan!

393
00:32:13,997 --> 00:32:16,158
I'll get Megan.

394
00:32:18,468 --> 00:32:20,698
You stay away from me!

395
00:32:20,904 --> 00:32:23,065
-I just want to be with my girl!
-Come on.

396
00:32:23,607 --> 00:32:25,131
Come on, let's go.

397
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:28,438
Coach? You've gotta get out of here!

398
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:36,315
You! It's your fault!

399
00:32:41,258 --> 00:32:43,783
-Where's Jordan?
-I didn't see him come out with us.

400
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,598
-Clark!
-Run!

401
00:32:55,238 --> 00:32:57,001
Jordan!

402
00:32:59,943 --> 00:33:01,501
Mr. Altman!

403
00:33:01,878 --> 00:33:04,005
Coach Altman!

404
00:33:04,948 --> 00:33:07,246
You've gotta get out of here!

405
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,585
Jordan.

406
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:48,284
Clark. Clark, are you okay?

407
00:33:48,492 --> 00:33:51,017
-Oh, my God. Is he okay?
-He's not breathing.

408
00:33:51,194 --> 00:33:52,456
Jordan.

409
00:33:52,796 --> 00:33:54,457
Come on, Jordan.

410
00:33:54,631 --> 00:33:56,292
You can't die on me.

411
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:06,908
Clark.

412
00:34:07,077 --> 00:34:08,806
It's okay. You're all right.

413
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:20,720
You're gonna be okay.

414
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:29,497
-Lex?
-Lana.

415
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:30,724
How you feeling?

416
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:36,502
Between the fire and my leg, I've seen
enough hospitals to last a lifetime.

417
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,536
-Have a seat.
-Thanks.

418
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,280
Lex, I think you were right
about taking a closer look at Adam.

419
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,613
Why the sudden change of heart?

420
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,220
Chloe caught him using
some sort of drug at school...

421
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:58,418
...and when I confronted him about it,
he almost lost it.

422
00:34:58,595 --> 00:35:02,622
Lana, I've had people assume
the worst about me all my life.

423
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,801
Trust me, it's hard to respond...

424
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:10,565
...when people always jump
to the wrong conclusions.

425
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:14,836
Lex, the last time we talked,
I got the impression...

426
00:35:15,011 --> 00:35:17,741
...that you'd be happier
if I kicked him out.

427
00:35:18,114 --> 00:35:19,809
It's not my choice to make...

428
00:35:20,817 --> 00:35:23,650
...but I've had a chance
to ask a few questions.

429
00:35:24,521 --> 00:35:27,752
Adam hasn't been healing
as well as his doctors had hoped.

430
00:35:28,658 --> 00:35:32,617
Apparently, he's part of a clinical
medical trial testing a new drug.

431
00:35:34,397 --> 00:35:37,093
That might explain the needle.

432
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:39,565
It doesn't explain why he was hiding it.

433
00:35:42,772 --> 00:35:46,833
I'm just beginning to wonder
who I let into my life.

434
00:35:50,013 --> 00:35:52,243
You should trust your instincts.

435
00:35:56,086 --> 00:35:58,316
Thanks, Lex.

436
00:36:18,074 --> 00:36:20,872
I promise your second week
of school will be easier.

437
00:36:21,044 --> 00:36:24,502
The paramedics said if you
hadn't given me CPR, I'd be...

438
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:27,673
-...dead.
-But you're not.

439
00:36:29,286 --> 00:36:30,844
I saw her, Clark.

440
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:33,184
-Who?
-My mom.

441
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:36,751
In that moment,
right before you pulled me back.

442
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:38,492
She was beautiful.

443
00:36:39,562 --> 00:36:41,496
I tried to run to her but couldn't.

444
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:43,732
Maybe it just wasn't your time.

445
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:45,994
When I woke up, they were gone.

446
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,328
The visions?

447
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:51,872
Maybe I was destined
to lose them when I met you.

448
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:56,209
Mind if I interrupt?
Jordan, I brought your homework.

449
00:36:59,282 --> 00:37:01,750
Why do I get the feeling
you've got a new mentor?

450
00:37:01,918 --> 00:37:06,981
I'm gonna help Jordan get back on his feet,
and he's gonna help me get faster on mine.

451
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,824
I think you're getting the hang
of this high school thing.

452
00:37:16,633 --> 00:37:18,692
How you doing?

453
00:37:20,303 --> 00:37:21,702
I know that look.

454
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:23,668
Are you sure you're okay?

455
00:37:25,342 --> 00:37:27,401
Yeah, I'm fine, Clark.

456
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:31,514
I'll see you tomorrow.

457
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:38,282
So we've got a lot of work to do.

458
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:51,657
What's wrong?

459
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,502
Lana, it's about your friend...

460
00:37:56,673 --> 00:37:59,107
...the one in the hall? Adam.

461
00:38:02,245 --> 00:38:04,110
He's from Oklahoma, right?

462
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,748
I don't know.
He's never really said anything.

463
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:09,085
Jordan, what's going on?

464
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:13,747
I think something really bad
happened to him.

465
00:38:14,524 --> 00:38:16,617
Well, he's been in the hospital.

466
00:38:16,793 --> 00:38:19,261
He was pretty seriously injured
a few months ago.

467
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:25,362
This is going to sound really strange...

468
00:38:27,137 --> 00:38:28,832
...but I think it's worse than that.

469
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:32,637
I don't think he was just hurt.

470
00:38:33,576 --> 00:38:35,510
I think he died.

471
00:38:46,556 --> 00:38:48,786
You're awfully quiet today.

472
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,591
Having someone tell you
you can change destiny is a lot to handle.

473
00:38:53,763 --> 00:38:57,062
Jordan's visions really struck a chord.

474
00:38:57,233 --> 00:39:00,669
Or just brought up questions
I had all along.

475
00:39:02,138 --> 00:39:05,938
Mom, by helping Mr. Altman,
I put three other lives in jeopardy.

476
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:08,407
But you were there for them.

477
00:39:09,212 --> 00:39:11,840
If it wasn't for me,
he wouldn't have hurt anyone.

478
00:39:12,015 --> 00:39:13,949
Clark, what's this really about?

479
00:39:15,819 --> 00:39:18,686
I'm wondering if that's why
I was really sent here...

480
00:39:18,855 --> 00:39:21,153
...to change destiny.

481
00:39:21,324 --> 00:39:25,260
What if I make a wrong choice,
and I'm not there to make it right?

482
00:39:25,862 --> 00:39:27,557
It's a huge responsibility.

483
00:39:27,864 --> 00:39:29,832
You have to concentrate
on the good you do.

484
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:34,231
Think of all the people you've saved,
your dad, and me and Lex.

485
00:39:34,404 --> 00:39:36,565
He's turned out to be a really good friend.

486
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,975
Sweetheart, you just have to do
the best you can.

487
00:39:40,143 --> 00:39:42,168
You can't save everybody.

488
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,639
I'll take some of these
out to your dad.

489
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:48,113
I'll do it.

490
00:39:49,285 --> 00:39:53,244
Well, could you please make sure at least
a couple of them make it to the barn?

491
00:39:53,456 --> 00:39:55,287
-Yes.
-Thank you.

492
00:39:56,326 --> 00:39:58,157
Thanks, Mom.

493
00:40:10,273 --> 00:40:12,070
Dad!

494
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:34,392
Dad. Dad!

495
00:40:35,732 --> 00:40:38,394
-Dad?
-Not now.

496
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:40,765
Not yet.

497
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,004
I love you, son.

498
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:50,107
Dad?

499
00:40:51,381 --> 00:40:52,473
Mom!

500
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:56,279
Mom!

501
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:00,787
Mom!

502
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
