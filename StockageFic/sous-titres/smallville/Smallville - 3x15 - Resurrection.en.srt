1
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:13,881
I get to take home the souvenir video
of this when we're done, right?

2
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,949
Jonathan, you can go ahead
and put your shirt on.

3
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,184
How does everything look,
Dr. Scanlan?

4
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:24,058
Well, I'm afraid the left ventricular
myocardium is still dyskinetic.

5
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:28,190
-Why don't I like the way that sounds?
-Because of the arterial blockage...

6
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:31,429
...I'm gonna recommend a triple bypass.

7
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:35,336
You're only in the hospital a few days.
I promise, when you come out...

8
00:00:35,509 --> 00:00:37,773
...you'll feel better
than when you came in.

9
00:00:37,945 --> 00:00:40,914
Open-heart surgery?
Don't you think that's a bit extreme?

10
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:42,981
We've been friends for a long time...

11
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,277
...and I know you can be a stubborn man.

12
00:00:45,452 --> 00:00:48,285
Look, given your
current condition, Jonathan...

13
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:51,424
...you could have another
heart attack any moment.

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,694
And the next time could be fatal.

15
00:00:56,797 --> 00:00:58,731
And the surgery could be fatal too?

16
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:00,261
Trust me.

17
00:01:00,434 --> 00:01:02,197
You stand a far greater risk...

18
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:04,537
...if you don't have this operation.

19
00:01:05,406 --> 00:01:07,431
Come on!

20
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:10,610
Garrett?

21
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:12,211
Garrett.

22
00:01:15,949 --> 00:01:17,849
Thanks, Clark.

23
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:23,888
You figure after a couple months,
it'd like me better.

24
00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:27,425
I thought your dad was out of the woods.

25
00:01:27,594 --> 00:01:29,084
So did l.

26
00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:31,891
But here we are again.

27
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:35,228
How's your brother doing, Garrett?

28
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,469
In serious need of a new liver.

29
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:45,703
If he doesn't get one soon, I don't
know how much time he's got left.

30
00:01:46,113 --> 00:01:50,607
Of course, if he knew I was out here,
instead of hitting the books, he'd pitch a fit.

31
00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:54,718
What's it looking like for your dad?

32
00:01:56,457 --> 00:01:58,118
They're talking open-heart surgery.

33
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:02,695
With everything you've told me about your
father, it should be a walk in the park.

34
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,630
You know, Garrett...

35
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:11,332
...I always thought of my dad
as a man of steel.

36
00:02:12,372 --> 00:02:14,465
I guess I was wrong.

37
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:16,842
Clark.

38
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:19,302
Your dad's gonna have that surgery.

39
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,347
And my brother's gonna get
that transplant. A year from now...

40
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:26,282
...we'll all get together and laugh
about how freaked out we both were.

41
00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:29,820
Yeah.

42
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:33,052
Code blue, room 247.

43
00:02:33,227 --> 00:02:35,161
Code blue, room 247.

44
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,763
God, that's Vince's room.

45
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,000
No. Another milligram of
epi. Come on. Charging.

46
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:47,002
Clear.

47
00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:49,005
-No response. Still V-tach.
-Vince.

48
00:02:49,176 --> 00:02:51,644
-Hey, get him out of here. Out of here!
-Vince?

49
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:55,812
-No, come on.
-No!

50
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:57,416
No, Vince!

51
00:02:58,118 --> 00:02:59,779
Vince, please!

52
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:03,719
-Vince! Not yet!
-Come on.

53
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:06,724
-Come on.
-Don't die.

54
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:14,564
All right, let's call it.

55
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:19,062
Time of death, 2:43 p.m.

56
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:28,444
I'm sorry, son.

57
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:42,418
Poor boy.

58
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:43,886
Where's his family?

59
00:04:44,057 --> 00:04:45,922
His brother was all he had.

60
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:48,618
His parents died in a car accident
when he was little.

61
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:50,956
Who's going to take care of him?

62
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:52,655
He's got an uncle in Germany.

63
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,926
It'll take him a few days to get here.

64
00:04:55,602 --> 00:04:58,571
-He said something about foster care.
-No.

65
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:01,799
He shouldn't be there
the night his brother died.

66
00:05:05,078 --> 00:05:06,943
He can stay with us for a few days.

67
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:09,844
Are you sure? What about dad's
surgery and everything?

68
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:13,849
I overheard.

69
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:16,182
Dad's not sure he's gonna have it yet.

70
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:19,920
I'm gonna go speak with Dr. Scanlan.

71
00:05:29,936 --> 00:05:31,563
Hey, Clark.

72
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:34,463
Look, I'm...

73
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:38,304
...sorry to hear about your friend, Garrett.
How's he holding up?

74
00:05:38,912 --> 00:05:40,709
He's in shock.

75
00:05:41,148 --> 00:05:45,812
Guess that's what happens when the most
important person in your life is gone.

76
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:49,355
I know about the surgery.

77
00:05:54,194 --> 00:05:56,628
Can you believe it?
I'm so popular around here...

78
00:05:56,797 --> 00:05:59,231
...they want me
to be admitted right away.

79
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,367
So you're gonna do it.

80
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:04,732
It's not quite that cut-and-dried, Clark.

81
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:06,668
There must be a way around this.

82
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,535
No, I heard the doctor.

83
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:10,870
It didn't sound like that.

84
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,077
I thought we talked about eavesdropping
on private conversations.

85
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,947
If you'd stop trying to protect me
from this, I wouldn't have to.

86
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,984
Dad, I see Garrett out there,
and he's lost.

87
00:06:28,361 --> 00:06:30,955
Just like I'd be without you.

88
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:36,597
Please do this.

89
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:41,968
Clark....

90
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,507
Go out there and tell your mother...

91
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:49,581
...to start filling out
all the admissions paperwork.

92
00:06:57,991 --> 00:06:59,754
Go on.

93
00:07:02,696 --> 00:07:04,857
And, Clark...

94
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,997
...don't worry about me, son.

95
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:09,959
I'm not going anywhere.

96
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:53,771
I want you to know
how much I appreciate this.

97
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:56,074
Oh, sweetheart,
we're happy to have you.

98
00:07:56,249 --> 00:08:00,379
Clark, I'm gonna go get some
things together for your dad.

99
00:08:04,124 --> 00:08:06,592
-Garrett, if you want to be alone--
-No.

100
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,557
I really don't.

101
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,260
It's kind of ironic.

102
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:17,997
My brother worked in demolition.

103
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:22,403
He risked his life every day with explosives,
and I lose him to liver disease.

104
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:27,879
If he had just gotten
that transplant, he'd still be....

105
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,383
Your dad's about to have surgery.
You don't need to hear this.

106
00:08:33,553 --> 00:08:35,851
No, Garrett, it helps to talk about it.

107
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:39,382
You listened to me that time
in the hospital.

108
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,824
Part of me feels like Vince
isn't really gone.

109
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:46,791
That it's all just
some big misunderstanding.

110
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:53,662
Garrett, if anyone needs to be told,
I can help. Make some phone calls....

111
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:55,531
No, it was just us.

112
00:08:59,613 --> 00:09:02,639
He used to call me "runt"
as long as I can remember.

113
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:07,752
I always hated it. Now I'd give
anything to hear him say it again.

114
00:09:10,557 --> 00:09:11,888
Garrett?

115
00:09:12,058 --> 00:09:14,322
I just got a call from the crematorium.

116
00:09:14,494 --> 00:09:17,327
They want to know where they
should send your brother's ashes.

117
00:09:17,497 --> 00:09:18,725
Ashes?

118
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:23,336
What are they talking about? He's supposed
to be buried next to my mom and dad.

119
00:09:37,183 --> 00:09:39,174
Let's move.

120
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:46,356
Syringe.

121
00:09:59,506 --> 00:10:01,667
Welcome back, Vince.

122
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:06,378
Why have him cremated?
That's not what he asked for.

123
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:09,174
We didn't send him.
Metropolis General did.

124
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:12,341
He was helicoptered there
for an organ donation.

125
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:16,989
Then it couldn't be the
same Vincent Davis.

126
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:19,318
That's what the paperwork says.

127
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:24,395
All the documents are signed, including your
brother's autograph on that cremation form.

128
00:10:24,564 --> 00:10:26,361
-No.
-Look.

129
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,763
Maybe you didn't know him
as well as you thought.

130
00:10:29,135 --> 00:10:31,501
-What are you talking about?
-Garrett, calm down.

131
00:10:31,671 --> 00:10:35,471
How am I supposed to be calm when he's
been carved up and burnt to a crisp?

132
00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:41,239
-Look, son, I know this is difficult, but--
-You don't know anything.

133
00:10:44,317 --> 00:10:46,444
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:52,087
Garrett, I know this is hard.

135
00:10:52,258 --> 00:10:53,782
Maybe Vince just didn't tell you.

136
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,521
My brother's told me everything
since the day my parents died.

137
00:10:58,131 --> 00:11:00,827
Those documents have to be forged.

138
00:11:06,673 --> 00:11:08,470
I think your embassy would keep tabs...

139
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:11,667
...on North Koreans who
have recently been deported.

140
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:14,177
Seems like Dr. Teng has vanished
without a trace.

141
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:16,281
It turns out that's not the only thing...

142
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:19,145
...out of the ordinary
of our friendly molecular biologist.

143
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,317
-What have you got?
-lt turns out it wasn't scientific research...

144
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,618
...or academic prestige that got her
into this country 1 2 years ago.

145
00:11:26,793 --> 00:11:28,761
It was wedding bells.

146
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:31,891
She married a rent-a-cop from LutherCorp.

147
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:39,070
So my father arranged
a green-card marriage.

148
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:43,938
Yeah. Now I tracked down the groom
so I could ask him what he knew.

149
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,840
What did the lucky guy have to say?

150
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:50,972
It wasn't really what he had to say.
It was more where he said it.

151
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:55,349
He plays watchdog for the old
Metron Pharmaceuticals building.

152
00:11:56,156 --> 00:11:58,522
That's been shut down for seven years.

153
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:00,056
Yeah, that's what I thought.

154
00:12:00,226 --> 00:12:02,251
But while he was telling me to get lost...

155
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:07,492
...I swear I saw what I think was a
delivery truck pulling around back.

156
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:11,831
My father's been strangely stubborn
about liquidating that property.

157
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:14,405
Every market indicator says to sell...

158
00:12:14,574 --> 00:12:17,407
...but he insists the neighborhood
is about to be revitalized.

159
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:21,009
The only thing being revitalized
in that neighborhood is the graffiti.

160
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:24,947
Now, I think I can make some headway
if you'll just come along with me.

161
00:12:25,618 --> 00:12:27,449
Chloe, I should take it from here.

162
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,613
-LeX, I'm perfectly capable of doing--
-This has nothing to do with your capability.

163
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,418
I'm worried about your safety.

164
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:37,457
When my father's involved
with covert research...

165
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,427
...people tend to get hurt.

166
00:12:43,303 --> 00:12:45,271
I'm sorry I lost it.

167
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:48,269
I guess I kind of have a short fuse.

168
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:50,534
You have every reason
to be upset, Garrett.

169
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,840
The thing is,
it just doesn't make any sense.

170
00:13:00,286 --> 00:13:03,449
-Vince?
-It's me, runt.

171
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,948
Vince!

172
00:13:06,126 --> 00:13:07,821
I can't believe it.

173
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:10,493
This is incredible.

174
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:16,332
Wait, I don't understand. We both saw you.
You were pronounced dead.

175
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:19,836
I guess they were wrong.

176
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:21,564
There's gotta be an eXplanation.

177
00:13:22,142 --> 00:13:25,077
All I know is, when I woke up,
I was in a lab...

178
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:29,477
...and this woman doctor with a needle
the size of Kansas was standing over me.

179
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:32,017
Come on, runt, we have
to get out of here.

180
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:35,313
-Wait, we should get you to a doctor.
-No more doctors or labs.

181
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:38,082
-Garrett and I have to fall off the radar.
-Why?

182
00:13:38,258 --> 00:13:40,624
-Who's after you?
-I don't know, but....

183
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:44,092
Can you tell me where the lab is?

184
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:47,927
It's....

185
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:52,470
-It's somewhere in Metropolis.
-Are you okay?

186
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,570
Garrett, what's wrong?

187
00:13:57,544 --> 00:13:59,136
Vince?

188
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,080
Your eyes.

189
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:04,782
They're bleeding.

190
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:14,850
Vince?

191
00:14:16,362 --> 00:14:17,624
Vince?

192
00:14:17,797 --> 00:14:20,288
What's happening to him?

193
00:14:21,134 --> 00:14:22,761
Vince.

194
00:14:22,936 --> 00:14:27,134
Vince, no! Clark,
you have to help him. Please.

195
00:14:32,312 --> 00:14:35,713
No, I don't know how to explain it.
This man was dead yesterday.

196
00:14:35,882 --> 00:14:38,043
He said he was revived
at a lab in Metropolis.

197
00:14:38,218 --> 00:14:41,847
Whatever they did, it was short-term.
He's not going to last much longer.

198
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:43,955
His liver is rapidly deteriorating.

199
00:14:44,123 --> 00:14:47,854
Dr. Yeager, call the lab and tell them
to give him more of whatever he got.

200
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:50,257
I have no idea what lab
you're talking about.

201
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,954
Don't hold out on me.

202
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:54,258
I'm not gonna stand here
while he dies again.

203
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:57,198
Look, I've never had a patient
come back to life before.

204
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,201
I'm just as confounded as you are.

205
00:14:59,372 --> 00:15:03,069
But I promise you, we're doing everything
we can to keep your brother alive.

206
00:15:04,877 --> 00:15:06,777
All right. Here we go.

207
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:17,054
White male, early 20s. Six feet,
1 80 pounds. Originally presented with....

208
00:15:17,223 --> 00:15:20,192
I'm not sure coming back here
was such a great idea.

209
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,955
There was no other place to take him.
At least they can try to stabilize him.

210
00:15:24,364 --> 00:15:26,832
I can't lose him twice, Clark.

211
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:45,144
How's Dad doing?

212
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:48,810
I feel like I'm being prepped for a
Thanksgiving dinner, and I'm the turkey.

213
00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:51,585
You'll have a good scar to brag about.

214
00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:53,658
What's happening with Garrett's brother?

215
00:15:53,826 --> 00:15:56,795
He's going downhill fast,
and the doctors don't know what to do.

216
00:15:56,963 --> 00:15:58,828
But he mentioned this lab in Metropolis.

217
00:15:58,998 --> 00:16:01,796
If I could find it, maybe I could
figure out what cured him.

218
00:16:02,468 --> 00:16:04,129
You need to help your friend, Clark.

219
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:08,870
-No, Dad, I'm not leaving you.
-Clark, I'm in very capable hands here.

220
00:16:10,476 --> 00:16:12,967
Honestly, you're not good
at sitting on the sidelines.

221
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:14,943
Garrett and Vince need you, Clark.

222
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:17,878
-Yeah, but--
-Son, if there is any chance...

223
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:20,349
...that you could save your friend's life...

224
00:16:21,454 --> 00:16:23,752
...then that's what you need to do.

225
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:28,827
Dad, I want you to know....

226
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:31,991
I do know, Clark.

227
00:16:37,236 --> 00:16:38,669
And I love you too.

228
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:42,040
Now go on.

229
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,869
Help your friend.

230
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:00,249
Clark.

231
00:17:00,426 --> 00:17:02,860
I thought you and your mom
could use moral support...

232
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:04,656
...and a little sustenance.

233
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:07,265
Thanks, Lana. My mom
hasn't eaten all day.

234
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:09,663
I'm sure she'll appreciate it.
I'll be back soon.

235
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:12,270
Is everything all right?

236
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:17,238
Do you know Garrett Davis?

237
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,901
Sure, he and Vince used to
come by the Talon.

238
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,206
Vince came down
with this rare liver disease...

239
00:17:22,382 --> 00:17:24,942
...and he needed a transplant.

240
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:27,609
I'm guessing from the past tense
that he never got it.

241
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:31,780
No. He died yesterday. Then last night,
he showed up at my barn.

242
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:34,392
He came back to life?

243
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,929
He seemed completely fine until
he started bleeding from his eyes.

244
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:41,261
I've seen it before...

245
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:44,432
...with Adam.

246
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:49,405
I found this obituary that said he died
5 months ago of a rare liver disease.

247
00:17:51,878 --> 00:17:54,403
Did you tell anyone?

248
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:57,272
Why not?

249
00:17:58,317 --> 00:18:01,150
Adam said if I told anyone,
they could be in danger.

250
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:02,816
Where is Adam now?

251
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:05,890
He disappeared. I haven't seen him
in more than a week.

252
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:09,619
Listen, Vince mentioned he got an
injection. Did Adam ever take anything?

253
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:13,095
Yeah. At first I thought it was
because he was a drug addict.

254
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:16,235
But maybe that's what was
keeping him alive.

255
00:18:30,516 --> 00:18:32,609
Hey, runt.

256
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:35,611
Vince.

257
00:18:40,193 --> 00:18:41,785
Vince....

258
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:44,788
I'm sorry.

259
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:48,326
What are you talking about?

260
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:50,867
I have a disease.

261
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:52,470
None of this is your fault.

262
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:55,607
But if it weren't for me,
you could've had such a better life.

263
00:18:55,908 --> 00:18:59,571
You would've married and had kids
of your own instead of worrying about me.

264
00:18:59,745 --> 00:19:03,977
Garrett, I wouldn't have done it
any different...

265
00:19:04,717 --> 00:19:07,345
...even if you are a runt.

266
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:20,727
Garrett.

267
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:32,635
There's not much else we can do
except make him comfortable.

268
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,339
Now might be a good time
to say your goodbyes.

269
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:39,844
I'm not saying goodbye to anybody.

270
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:43,386
-Son, I know this is hard--
-I'm not gonna let him die.

271
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:48,257
Do you hear me?
I'm not gonna let him die.

272
00:19:58,671 --> 00:20:00,571
They'll be here any minute.

273
00:20:02,174 --> 00:20:06,440
Now, Martha, you and I both know
that there's a chance...

274
00:20:06,612 --> 00:20:08,671
...that things could go south in there.

275
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:10,475
Don't say that, please.

276
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,915
Now, there's no doubt in my mind
that you and Clark can take...

277
00:20:14,086 --> 00:20:18,250
...good care of each other.
But you have to remember our promise.

278
00:20:18,424 --> 00:20:20,824
When he's ready...

279
00:20:20,993 --> 00:20:22,688
...you have to let him go.

280
00:20:22,862 --> 00:20:24,955
When that day comes...

281
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:27,656
...you'll be standing right beside me.

282
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,241
We're ready.

283
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:47,051
Clark, I can run with this if you
wanna be with your dad.

284
00:20:47,219 --> 00:20:52,179
It's all right, he knows I'm here. It also takes
my mind off the fact that I can't do anything.

285
00:20:52,358 --> 00:20:55,156
Everything's gonna be okay.

286
00:20:56,762 --> 00:20:59,287
We need to figure out
what brought Vince back to life.

287
00:20:59,465 --> 00:21:03,663
Well, it looks like my contact
at Metropolis General e-mailed me.

288
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:07,668
The only organ donors who arrived
yesterday were both females.

289
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:13,443
That means the medevac chopper
took Garrett's brother somewhere else.

290
00:21:13,613 --> 00:21:15,513
Seems that flyboy is the one to talk to.

291
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:27,189
Are you Ben Powell?

292
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,827
What's it to you?

293
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:31,759
Where'd you take that body yesterday?

294
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:37,301
Look, I don't know what kind of game you're
playing, but I'm an emergency medical pilot.

295
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,598
You left to take a body to Metropolis
General and it never arrived.

296
00:21:40,773 --> 00:21:43,901
I'm not a lawyer, but I guess you could
do some serious jail time...

297
00:21:44,076 --> 00:21:47,512
...for using a medevac helicopter
for your own profit.

298
00:21:49,048 --> 00:21:50,606
What do you want?

299
00:21:50,783 --> 00:21:52,876
Take me where you took
Vincent Davis.

300
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:15,497
What is this place?

301
00:22:15,675 --> 00:22:18,735
They pay me cash. I don't ask questions.

302
00:22:58,584 --> 00:22:59,949
Who's there?

303
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:03,282
-I thought I'd never see you again.
-What are you doing here?

304
00:23:03,456 --> 00:23:05,617
So this is where you were deported to.

305
00:23:05,991 --> 00:23:09,358
I can only imagine the moves you used
to sway the immigration officers.

306
00:23:09,528 --> 00:23:12,019
How did you get past security?

307
00:23:12,198 --> 00:23:16,532
As I'm sure you're well aware,
this building is owned by LuthorCorp.

308
00:23:16,702 --> 00:23:19,762
Family name tends to open doors.

309
00:23:24,443 --> 00:23:26,911
Now, this looks familiar.

310
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,373
It's identical to the vial found
in Adam Knight's apartment.

311
00:23:31,784 --> 00:23:34,150
It's a very delicate substance.

312
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:39,257
If you don't leave at once,
I'm notifying your father.

313
00:23:39,425 --> 00:23:42,360
Can't you just send me
to the principal instead?

314
00:23:42,528 --> 00:23:44,655
I offered to fund your research, doctor.

315
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,525
You turned your back on me.

316
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:50,157
I suggest you tell me the origin
of your little blood-platelet cocktail...

317
00:23:50,336 --> 00:23:52,804
...or I'll make sure lNS
reserves you a window seat...

318
00:23:52,972 --> 00:23:55,236
...on the next flight to Pyongyang.

319
00:23:55,674 --> 00:23:57,665
Something tells me
they don't look kindly...

320
00:23:57,843 --> 00:24:01,074
...on North Koreans doing illegal
research on American soil.

321
00:24:11,423 --> 00:24:13,653
Where did it go?

322
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:18,420
What did you just do?

323
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,636
Are you ready to proceed?

324
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:31,041
Yes.

325
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,802
Go ahead, start it.

326
00:24:32,978 --> 00:24:35,879
I want two more milligrams of
potassium chloride in the lV.

327
00:24:36,048 --> 00:24:37,310
Yes, doctor.

328
00:24:37,483 --> 00:24:39,280
-Vitals?
-Pulse has leveled off at 80.

329
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:41,248
BP, 1 20/70.

330
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,910
EKG normal.

331
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:46,322
-Blood ox?
-98 percent, normal.

332
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:50,155
Okay, Jonathan, we're gonna have
you out of here in no time.

333
00:24:56,068 --> 00:24:58,935
I suppose all we can do now is wait.

334
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:00,969
Mr. Kent's strong.

335
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,007
He's gonna fight through this.

336
00:25:04,176 --> 00:25:05,507
Oh, Pete.

337
00:25:05,945 --> 00:25:08,106
I wasn't sure if you guys
wanted your space...

338
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,475
...but I thought I should be here.

339
00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:12,776
I'm so glad you came.

340
00:25:12,952 --> 00:25:14,317
Where's Clark?

341
00:25:14,486 --> 00:25:15,976
-He'll be right back.
-Okay.

342
00:25:16,155 --> 00:25:18,214
Dr. Yeager!

343
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:23,558
Where is Dr. Yeager?

344
00:25:24,263 --> 00:25:26,322
I want to speak to Dr. Yeager!

345
00:25:26,498 --> 00:25:29,365
-What do you think you're doing?
-My brother needs a liver.

346
00:25:31,637 --> 00:25:33,901
So I figure now you'll get him one.

347
00:25:34,506 --> 00:25:37,634
Garrett, this isn't gonna solve anything.

348
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,209
Don't come any closer.

349
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,640
If you want anyone to leave
with their limbs attached...

350
00:25:43,816 --> 00:25:47,013
...you'd better make sure
my brother gets that transplant.

351
00:25:59,698 --> 00:26:02,690
We need you to stay
behind the barricade at this time.

352
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:07,498
Everyone, please stay behind the barricade.
This is a high-alert situation.

353
00:26:15,547 --> 00:26:17,640
-Sheriff!
-Just hold it.

354
00:26:17,816 --> 00:26:21,252
Hey, not now, Mr. Kent. Now if you
can't tell, I am a little busy here.

355
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,718
My parents are in there.
My dad's having surgery.

356
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:26,858
Please. What's going on?

357
00:26:27,026 --> 00:26:29,085
Let him go.

358
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:34,824
There is a kid in there...

359
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,061
...who is gonna blow this place to kingdom
come unless his brother gets a transplant.

360
00:26:39,238 --> 00:26:41,001
Garrett Davis?

361
00:26:41,173 --> 00:26:43,971
-You know him?
-His brother doesn't need a transplant.

362
00:26:44,143 --> 00:26:45,735
I have medicine that can cure him.

363
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:50,012
-Where'd you get this wonder drug?
-Doesn't matter.

364
00:26:50,182 --> 00:26:54,619
If you tell him I have this, we can prevent
anyone from getting hurt. I know him.

365
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:55,913
He's just desperate.

366
00:26:56,088 --> 00:26:58,955
Well, desperate equals dangerous
in my book.

367
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:01,516
Sheriff, please.

368
00:27:03,128 --> 00:27:04,527
Just get him on the phone.

369
00:27:04,697 --> 00:27:06,824
He'll talk to me.

370
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,398
We have a serious problem.

371
00:27:14,974 --> 00:27:16,839
Clark can't help us in here.

372
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:19,944
That bomb is laced with meteor rock.

373
00:27:20,112 --> 00:27:23,206
His family uses it
for their demolition business.

374
00:27:23,382 --> 00:27:25,850
More bang for their buck.

375
00:27:44,603 --> 00:27:47,265
Mrs. Kent, you're a nice lady.
I don't want to hurt you.

376
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:49,703
Don't do this, Garrett.

377
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,775
It's not what your brother would want.

378
00:27:51,944 --> 00:27:54,276
I know exactly what my brother wanted.

379
00:27:54,446 --> 00:27:56,710
A transplant, and to see me
graduate high school.

380
00:27:56,882 --> 00:27:58,782
I'm gonna make sure he gets
both of those.

381
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:01,943
Even if I have to be locked up
when I get that diploma.

382
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:12,657
-Yeah?
-Garrett, it's Clark.

383
00:28:12,831 --> 00:28:16,699
I tracked down the lab they took Vince to,
and I grabbed a vial of the medicine.

384
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,302
I'm holding it right here.

385
00:28:19,571 --> 00:28:22,768
-Why should I trust you?
-Because I've done nothing but try to help.

386
00:28:24,176 --> 00:28:26,269
Okay, come in, but just you.

387
00:28:26,445 --> 00:28:29,141
No. I will not allow that.

388
00:28:29,581 --> 00:28:31,549
I'll get one of my deputies
to bring it in.

389
00:28:31,717 --> 00:28:33,150
It's Clark or no one.

390
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:37,555
You have to let the hostages go.

391
00:28:41,794 --> 00:28:45,195
That's the only way they're
even gonna think about letting me in.

392
00:29:12,157 --> 00:29:13,419
Clark.

393
00:29:13,592 --> 00:29:15,219
-Mom, are you okay?
-I'm fine.

394
00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:18,994
Your father's still in the operating room.
Garrett means what he says.

395
00:29:19,164 --> 00:29:22,065
I need to get this to Vince,
then I'll take care of the bomb.

396
00:29:22,234 --> 00:29:24,794
Clark, you may not be able to.

397
00:29:25,604 --> 00:29:29,165
It's made with kryptonite. Be careful.

398
00:29:34,813 --> 00:29:37,213
There is too much at stake here.

399
00:29:37,382 --> 00:29:38,974
You find a good vantage point.

400
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:42,348
You get a clean shot. You take him out.

401
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,892
Garrett.

402
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,892
Where is it?

403
00:29:53,665 --> 00:29:56,065
It's right here.

404
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:05,276
-What are you doing?
-You have a bomb strapped to your chest.

405
00:30:05,444 --> 00:30:07,912
I prefer to just keep my distance.

406
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,684
Is it supposed to do this?

407
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:24,392
I don't know.

408
00:30:28,066 --> 00:30:30,534
Doctor?

409
00:30:32,905 --> 00:30:35,567
I need you to give my brother
an injection of this...

410
00:30:35,741 --> 00:30:38,039
...in his chest.

411
00:30:41,446 --> 00:30:43,175
-What is this?
-Just do it.

412
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:46,282
Please, just do it.

413
00:31:02,634 --> 00:31:04,465
What are you waiting for?

414
00:31:05,537 --> 00:31:07,129
Hurry!

415
00:31:17,015 --> 00:31:19,108
How long is it supposed to take, Clark?

416
00:31:19,284 --> 00:31:20,546
I'm not sure.

417
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:28,184
There's no change in his vitals.

418
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:30,823
It's not working?

419
00:31:30,996 --> 00:31:32,759
-You lied to me, Clark.
-No, I didn't.

420
00:31:32,931 --> 00:31:36,697
-That's it. My brother's getting a liver now.
-We don't have one, Garrett.

421
00:31:36,868 --> 00:31:39,393
Yes, you do. You've got
a man lying in the OR.

422
00:31:40,172 --> 00:31:42,367
-That's my dad.
-I don't have another choice.

423
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:45,476
-No, you're not touching him.
-Clark.

424
00:31:47,746 --> 00:31:49,145
You'll still have a mom.

425
00:31:49,314 --> 00:31:51,544
If Vince dies I have no one.

426
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:55,978
-Son, the chances of success are very low.
-Just go.

427
00:31:57,322 --> 00:31:58,880
Now.

428
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,656
-Doctor, you can't do this.
-I know I can't.

429
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,823
But there are 20 other patients in this
building. I don't know what to do.

430
00:32:26,852 --> 00:32:29,343
You don't want to do this, Garrett.

431
00:32:29,521 --> 00:32:30,852
I'm sorry, Clark.

432
00:33:22,808 --> 00:33:24,799
Is everyone all right?

433
00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:27,410
Everything's stable.

434
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:29,843
Let's continue.

435
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:39,819
Your father wanted to cut off
his medication.

436
00:33:39,991 --> 00:33:42,653
He said Adam Knight's role
in the project was done...

437
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:44,159
...but I couldn't do it.

438
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:46,229
It was barbaric.
It would've killed him.

439
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:48,923
That's why you've hidden him
down here from my father.

440
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:51,626
Why don't we just keep the kid
on the medicine?

441
00:33:51,803 --> 00:33:53,828
The platelets are in extremely
short supply.

442
00:33:54,005 --> 00:33:56,667
You haven't told me where these
blood platelets come from.

443
00:33:56,842 --> 00:33:58,104
I don't know.

444
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,234
Why would I lie to you?

445
00:34:00,412 --> 00:34:02,778
You're my only way out
from your father's grip.

446
00:34:02,948 --> 00:34:06,475
But I do know they have the remarkable
ability to revivify necrotic tissue.

447
00:34:06,651 --> 00:34:10,246
So why is it that all the subjects suffer
from the same liver disease?

448
00:34:10,422 --> 00:34:13,789
The cells in the liver are the
most resilient cells in the body.

449
00:34:15,794 --> 00:34:17,694
I want you to relaX, Adam.

450
00:34:17,863 --> 00:34:20,161
It's me, Dr. Teng.

451
00:34:33,044 --> 00:34:35,478
What's wrong with him?

452
00:34:35,647 --> 00:34:37,911
He's deteriorating.

453
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:40,745
I told your father not to rush
the serum's development.

454
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:43,251
But he wouldn't listen.

455
00:34:59,037 --> 00:35:01,267
I don't think it's gonna get much cleaner.

456
00:35:02,841 --> 00:35:05,275
What brings you to the far
reaches of the Talon?

457
00:35:05,444 --> 00:35:09,244
I thought I might be able to find a clue
to the former tenant's whereabouts.

458
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,715
Why? He's gone.

459
00:35:13,885 --> 00:35:15,409
That's what's important.

460
00:35:17,856 --> 00:35:19,824
You wouldn't know where he is,
would you?

461
00:35:19,991 --> 00:35:21,424
No.

462
00:35:21,593 --> 00:35:23,993
I just want to forget
that he ever lived here.

463
00:35:24,162 --> 00:35:25,823
Yeah, I can see that.

464
00:35:26,498 --> 00:35:27,988
Lana...

465
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:30,558
...is there something
you're not telling me?

466
00:35:33,605 --> 00:35:34,867
No.

467
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,302
Of course not.

468
00:35:41,446 --> 00:35:45,109
I guess I'm gonna have to put
all his stuff in storage.

469
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:55,419
Look....

470
00:35:59,498 --> 00:36:00,965
I want you to know...

471
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:04,529
...if you ever feel
like talking about Adam...

472
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:06,500
...I'm always here.

473
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:12,566
LeX....

474
00:36:14,446 --> 00:36:16,471
Why are you still interested
in him, anyway?

475
00:36:20,585 --> 00:36:23,520
You came to me and asked
if I could get him out of your life.

476
00:36:23,688 --> 00:36:27,852
I'm just following up
and making sure he stays that way.

477
00:36:53,218 --> 00:36:56,676
Hey, thanks for the lift.
I think I can take it from here.

478
00:36:56,855 --> 00:36:59,551
Easy, Jonathan.
The doctor said to stand slowly.

479
00:36:59,724 --> 00:37:01,954
If I stand any slower,
I'll be standing still.

480
00:37:02,127 --> 00:37:06,029
Thank you so much
for everything. Bye-bye.

481
00:37:06,598 --> 00:37:08,429
Hey, Clark....

482
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,902
It's all right, son. The doctor says
that the worst of this is behind me.

483
00:37:17,976 --> 00:37:19,238
Hey, Clark?

484
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,975
What's bothering you, son?

485
00:37:26,284 --> 00:37:28,946
When I went to pick up the vial
for Vince, Lex was there.

486
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,281
He was talking to one of the scientists.

487
00:37:31,456 --> 00:37:35,449
From their conversation, it sounds
like Lionel Luthor is behind all of it.

488
00:37:36,861 --> 00:37:38,692
Now, why doesn't that surprise me?

489
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:41,530
When the serum got close
to the kryptonite bomb...

490
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,533
...it reacted the same way as my blood.

491
00:37:45,804 --> 00:37:48,898
-So you're saying the serum....
-I know.

492
00:37:49,074 --> 00:37:51,770
It sounds crazy, but I think
Lionel Luthor's found a way...

493
00:37:51,943 --> 00:37:54,207
...to use my blood to bring
people back to life.

494
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:01,451
If my blood can save lives...

495
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,212
...maybe I should come forward.

496
00:38:04,589 --> 00:38:08,047
What if something inside me could
repair dad's heart permanently?

497
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,691
Clark...

498
00:38:10,762 --> 00:38:15,995
...your mother and I both know that you
are gonna save a lot of lives in this world.

499
00:38:17,002 --> 00:38:18,799
Even more than you have any idea.

500
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,542
The only life I'm interested
in saving is yours.

501
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,678
You do.

502
00:38:27,946 --> 00:38:31,074
You save my life every day
that you're with us.

503
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:39,954
And we wouldn't trade that
for a single moment without you.

504
00:38:51,736 --> 00:38:54,569
-Hey.
-Hey, how's your dad feeling?

505
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:56,764
You'd never know
he just had a triple bypass.

506
00:38:56,941 --> 00:39:00,001
My mom bought the doctor
a combat helmet as a thank-you gift.

507
00:39:00,178 --> 00:39:03,614
Only your dad could survive
surgery during a siege.

508
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:09,677
I talked to Garrett's uncle.
He wanted to know what happened.

509
00:39:09,954 --> 00:39:11,216
What did you say?

510
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:13,755
Well, I couldn't eXplain
Vince's resurrection...

511
00:39:13,925 --> 00:39:16,325
...but I told him that Garrett
was a good kid.

512
00:39:16,761 --> 00:39:18,285
You know, he was desperate.

513
00:39:18,463 --> 00:39:20,931
He wanted to do whatever he could
to save his brother.

514
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:23,897
I should've said something
about Adam sooner.

515
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:26,731
-I feel so guilty.
-None of this was your fault.

516
00:39:26,905 --> 00:39:31,171
Still, I let him threaten me into silence.

517
00:39:31,376 --> 00:39:33,742
Because you knew it would put
people in danger.

518
00:39:33,912 --> 00:39:36,142
I understand keeping secrets
for that reason.

519
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:39,876
It was really hard
keeping it from everyone.

520
00:39:40,051 --> 00:39:43,145
It's kind of a relief to tell you.

521
00:39:47,492 --> 00:39:49,983
Lana, no matter where we stand...

522
00:39:50,161 --> 00:39:54,063
...I'm still your friend,
and you can tell me anything.

523
00:39:56,901 --> 00:39:59,028
You know that goes both ways.

524
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:06,467
Clark.

525
00:40:08,379 --> 00:40:11,109
What do you think was in that serum?

526
00:40:14,018 --> 00:40:15,713
I have no idea.

527
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,000
