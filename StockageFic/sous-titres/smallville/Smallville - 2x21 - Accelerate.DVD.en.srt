1
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:07,072
Now, I'm gonna knock on the other wall.
When you hear me, you knock on this wall.

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,965
What is she, crazy? Hey, get that candle
and get your butt out of there!

3
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:15,478
- I don't think she can hear you, Pete.
- Guys, hit the mute button, okay?

4
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,129
Lance! Oh, Lance!

5
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,064
Oh, I saw it again!

6
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,150
Hello?

7
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:07,924
Who's there?

8
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:31,083
- Would you like some tea?
- Yes, please.

9
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:35,250
- I've got an elephant. What do you have?
- Rhinoceros.

10
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,294
Would you like an apple?

11
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,995
Good.

12
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:45,766
Lana? I got a hippopotamus.

13
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,868
You're so big.

14
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,274
Why are you scared?

15
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,491
Do you want to play with me?

16
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,462
Lana, what's going on?

17
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,066
I thought I...

18
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,874
I guess... The lights went out, and...

19
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,376
I guess the movie creeped me out.
I thought I saw...

20
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:28,844
Thought you saw what?

21
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,650
- Nothing.
- Let's get out of the dark.

22
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,257
You sure you're okay?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

23
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,697
That's my favorite dress.

24
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,331
You're... You're not real.

25
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:06,604
- I am too real.
- No, you died.

26
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,911
Lana? Chloe's dad said you were up here.

27
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,656
Lana, what is it?

28
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,331
Clark.

29
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,728
It sounds so ridiculous.

30
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,399
You can tell me anything, Lana.
You know that.

31
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,803
Clark, do you believe in ghosts?

32
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:48,051
We used to come out here all the time.
We'd make little boats...

33
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,951
...out of flowers
and float them downstream.

34
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,957
They always sunk
before they got around the bend.

35
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,226
Is this where she drowned?

36
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,593
It was raining...

37
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,966
...and the bridge was slippery.

38
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,403
The next thing I knew...

39
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,405
It's okay.

40
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,417
Okay.

41
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,989
Funny thing is...

42
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,896
...Emily always believed in ghosts.

43
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,163
Whenever a candle flickered
or a curtain rustled...

44
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,069
...she'd insist it was my mom
trying to talk to me.

45
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,870
As much as I wanted to believe her,
I always knew it was make-believe.

46
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:56,884
Maybe this is her way of showing me that
the dead really can communicate with us.

47
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:03,862
If she is a ghost, why do you think
she waited so long to contact you?

48
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,159
I don't know.

49
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,138
There's just gotta be
a rational explanation for this girl.

50
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:18,701
- Have you kept in contact with her parents?
- No, they split up after the accident.

51
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,039
I don't know where her mom is,
but her dad moved to Grandville.

52
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,543
Maybe you're not the only one
who's seen her.

53
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,895
Didn't you see
the "No Trespassing" signs?

54
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,032
Mr. Dinsmore, it's me, Lana Lang.

55
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:50,607
Oh, well, look at you. All grown up.

56
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:57,782
Mr. Dinsmore, this is...
This is going to sound strange...

57
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,482
...but I think I saw Emily.

58
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,979
What is this, some kind of sick joke?

59
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,982
I don't mean to upset you. It's just...

60
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,286
...I've seen her twice.

61
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,929
We figured if anybody else had seen her,
it'd be you.

62
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,301
Sure, I've seen her...

63
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,838
Whenever I hear her favorite song...

64
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:24,238
...or see a young girl jumping rope
in the park.

65
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,239
Losing a child is something
a parent never gets over.

66
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,883
Now, if you'll excuse me.

67
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:56,705
Mr. Luthor, I would think quick
decision-making would be your forte.

68
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:00,539
That's why I made the quick decision
to put Helen in charge of the wedding.

69
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:06,174
Well, I don't see her here, and
we're three weeks away and counting.

70
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:11,723
- Hello.
- I knew you had your vices, son...

71
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:15,054
...but I didn't realize gluttony
was one of them.

72
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,393
Oh, I suppose if there's anyone who's
an authority on the seven deadly sins...

73
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,295
...it's you, Dad.

74
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,671
Amaretto truffle.

75
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,432
Could I have some water, please?

76
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:33,802
The liqueur seems to be overpowering
the butter.

77
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,311
Thank you.

78
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,882
As much as I value
your epicurean input, Dad...

79
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,019
...I'm curious, why are you in Smallville?

80
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,645
I wanted to give you my gift in person...

81
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:49,284
...since it's obvious by now that
I won't be receiving a wedding invitation.

82
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:54,797
You offered the woman I love
$ 100,000 to leave me.

83
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,457
I did you a favor, Lex.

84
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,836
That was the ultimate test of loyalty.

85
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,804
And she passed with flying colors.
You should be thanking me.

86
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:07,378
Thanking you? Well, my thank-you note
must be lost in the mail...

87
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,538
...along with your invitation.

88
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,411
Go on, open it.

89
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:28,126
- A Caribbean honeymoon.
- Your own private island.

90
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,698
I'll throw in the LuthorCorp jet as well.

91
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,700
Why?

92
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,849
I just want you to be happy, Lex.

93
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:06,302
Clark, when you turned in your press pass,
you relinquished your computer privileges.

94
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:10,135
I don't mean to be hall monitor,
but it is school policy.

95
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,445
- I'm trying to help Lana.
- Of course you are.

96
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,547
What are you saving her from today?

97
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,151
She's being haunted by a girl
who died six years ago.

98
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:22,587
Okay, I'm piqued. Go on.

99
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,289
She thinks it's a ghost.
I'm not so sure.

100
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,154
It's not like people haven't
come back to life around here.

101
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:32,559
Even though it goes against my natural
slant toward all things Wall of Weird...

102
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,257
...I think there's another explanation
for this.

103
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,466
Lana's been through a lot in her life.

104
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,597
Maybe this haunting is a way she's dealing
with it through her subconscious.

105
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,936
You think she's seeing things
that aren't there?

106
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,272
No, I think to her they're very real.

107
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,078
- She's not crazy.
- I wasn't saying she's crazy.

108
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,708
All I'm saying is, there's a lot of things
about Lana that you don't know.

109
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:58,983
I mean, you don't hear her crying
in her room at 3:00 in the morning.

110
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,285
What you see is just a mask.

111
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,064
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because she talks to you.

112
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,395
Regardless of what's going on
between us, she's still my friend.

113
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,597
Chloe.

114
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,137
Thanks.

115
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,211
Lock up when you're done.

116
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:42,093
Sweetheart, I've been looking
all over for you.

117
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,965
- Everything's different.
- What do you mean?

118
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,172
Where are all the bunnies?

119
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,612
Honey, we can talk about that
when we get home. Okay?

120
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,976
This is our home, Daddy.

121
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,646
No, not anymore, sweetheart.
Our home's in Grandville.

122
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,525
I don't understand.

123
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,491
Lana said I died.

124
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,661
Lana doesn't know
what she's talking about.

125
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,826
Yes, she does.
She's my best friend.

126
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,172
Emily...

127
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,100
...get in the car.

128
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,271
No.

129
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:34,285
I'm not going.
I don't want to be locked up anymore.

130
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,684
I want to be a normal girl.
I want to play with Lana.

131
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,151
You have to listen to me, Emily.

132
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,990
You are never to see Lana Lang again.

133
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,533
- Do you understand?
- You can't tell me what to do.

134
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,001
I'll do whatever I want.

135
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:22,860
Clark, couldn't the boneyard visit
have waited till after the rain stopped?

136
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,868
It's the only way to disprove
the zombie theory.

137
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,565
Yeah, well, if this Emily girl
really is a ghost...

138
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:33,337
...I really don't think she'd appreciate
you scoping out her coffin.

139
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,947
Pete, here it is.

140
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,949
"Emily Eve Dinsmore.

141
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,094
Loving child, blessed angel."

142
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,169
The body hasn't been touched.

143
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,350
Where did she go...?

144
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:36,973
Clark?

145
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,031
Let me in, Lana.

146
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,754
I know why you're scared of me.

147
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,554
I saw my grave.

148
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,790
But I'm not dead, Lana.

149
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,364
Who are you?

150
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,164
I'm Emily, silly.

151
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:51,315
- What do you want from me?
- My daddy said I can't see you anymore.

152
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,713
Did you do something bad?

153
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,680
Lana.

154
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,859
She's here.

155
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,637
Where?

156
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:22,810
- I swear it, Clark, she was right here.
- Lana, it's okay, I believe you.

157
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,577
Emily's not a ghost. I saw her.

158
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,950
In the graveyard. It's where I found this.

159
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:39,119
Her father gave it to her because
she wanted a necklace like mine.

160
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,467
But it can't be Emily.
She couldn't still be 10 years old.

161
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:45,898
I don't know who it is.

162
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,666
But I think I know how she's able
to just appear out of nowhere.

163
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,002
I think she moves faster
than we can see her.

164
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:58,878
- How?
- I'm not sure, but... Hey...

165
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,576
...at least we know you're not
losing your mind.

166
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,117
Thanks, Clark.

167
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,667
Back from Metropolis so soon?

168
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:27,145
- Awfully long drive for quality health care.
- You tailing me, Lex? I hope not.

169
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,974
- A bit obsessive, don't you think?
- I heard you were here.

170
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:34,175
- I wanted to make sure you were okay.
- I came to visit a former employee.

171
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:38,084
He's just been admitted.
Unfortunately, he's still unconscious.

172
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:42,489
He must have been an exceptional worker
to merit a visit from the CEO.

173
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:47,064
I like to think that I treat everyone
at LuthorCorp as part of the family.

174
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,099
Oh, that would explain
their lack of loyalty.

175
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:57,240
Have you become so cynical that you read
ill will into my good intentions?

176
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,539
I'm just wondering why you're spending
so much time in Smallville lately, that's all.

177
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,841
You may not believe me,
I'm sure you won't...

178
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:09,078
...but I've always tried
to be a good father to you, son.

179
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:15,550
I worry about you. Son, these obsessive,
paranoid tendencies...

180
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:19,629
The danger with indulging them
is that you lose perspective.

181
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,289
And you turn your back
on what truly matters.

182
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,535
Lex? Coming?

183
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,642
He's sleeping.

184
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,183
I tried to wake him up.

185
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,015
He needs to take care of me.

186
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,850
I have nowhere to go.

187
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:28,394
- What's your name?
- Emily. He's my daddy.

188
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,440
I think our daddies are friends.
Mine was just in here.

189
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,870
He's a bad man.

190
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:47,885
- Did he do something to your daddy?
- He took the bunnies away.

191
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:53,324
- What bunnies, Emily?
- The ones in the back yard.

192
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,897
Maybe I should talk to your mommy.

193
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,390
Is she here?

194
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,084
Come on, stay close.

195
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,424
You're my best friend.

196
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,234
You're my best friend.

197
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,078
You're my best friend.

198
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,874
This must be what you saw
at the Talon.

199
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,615
You're my best friend.

200
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,483
You're my best friend.

201
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,891
You're my best friend.

202
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:40,798
Who needs human companionship when
you could have a Gabby Abby?

203
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,276
I remember this.

204
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,314
I gave it to Emily for her ninth birthday.

205
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:10,384
Last entry's from the day before she died:
"I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow.

206
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:16,056
Lana and I are going to the river.
We're going to be best friends forever."

207
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,739
Lana.

208
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,607
Oh, my God.

209
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:01,365
- Clark, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

210
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,763
Let's get out of here.

211
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,403
You did the right thing, calling the police.

212
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,176
- He was trying to clone his daughter?
- More than try. We think he succeeded.

213
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,513
Whoever's funding him's
sure got a lot of money.

214
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,349
Dinsmore even wanted her to have
the same memories as Emily.

215
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,692
- That's why he gave her the diary.
- That little girl must be so confused.

216
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,493
All she wanted was a friend,
and I just scared her away.

217
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,794
- I have to go and find her.
- Lana, I don't think that's a good idea.

218
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:42,531
Clark's right. Until we know more,
why don't you stay here?

219
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:56,218
- Mrs. Kent, Mr. Kent.
- Hello, sheriff.

220
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,679
- We followed up on your story.
- You found the lab.

221
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,425
After we got your call,
we went and checked it out.

222
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,188
David Copperfield must've got there first.

223
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,897
I saw them.

224
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,267
The people who took everything away?

225
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,480
The sleeping girls.

226
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:59,408
Why are they like me?

227
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:13,288
- Emily...
- My daddy said I can't remember...

228
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,059
...because I had an accident.

229
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:22,429
You don't remember anything
because you didn't write that.

230
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,768
A different Emily did.

231
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:30,805
She's the girl buried in the graveyard,
isn't she?

232
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,041
Yeah.

233
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,321
This is her story.

234
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:43,421
But you have to write your own.

235
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,589
Why would my daddy lie to me?

236
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:56,372
He probably thought that telling you
the truth would make you feel different.

237
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,842
But there's nothing wrong
with being different.

238
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,345
I'm different too.
It doesn't change who we are.

239
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,607
Yes, it does.

240
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,316
Lex, what are you doing here?

241
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,121
I could ask the same of you.

242
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,623
I met Emily Dinsmore.

243
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,932
You can't blame me
for being a little intrigued...

244
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:29,005
...after I found out she died six years ago.

245
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:33,199
So you don't know anything
about the lab that was down here?

246
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,911
They cloned Emily here. That's why
your father's been refining meteor rocks.

247
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,708
- What?
- There were jars of it.

248
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,978
Right where you're standing.

249
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:52,927
Before Dinsmore left LuthorCorp,
he was developing a technique...

250
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:55,123
...to speed up cell growth.

251
00:28:56,101 --> 00:29:00,367
He claimed he could incubate a rabbit
embryo to adulthood in a matter of days.

252
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,632
He's been using the meteor rocks
as Miracle-Gro.

253
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:07,404
That's why Emily looks like
she's 10 years old already.

254
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:13,283
All ethics aside,
it's an astonishing accomplishment.

255
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,948
Well, tell that to the little girl
who doesn't know who she is.

256
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,206
I brought you a picture.

257
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:23,952
Thanks.

258
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,092
Emily, I want to talk to you.

259
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,386
Are you ready to go to the river?

260
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,164
Not today.

261
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:41,901
- Don't you want to be my friend anymore?
- Of course I do, but...

262
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:47,340
Come to the river. I'll race you.
I want everything to be like before.

263
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,672
No! Emily, wait.

264
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,756
You're here about Emily, aren't you?

265
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,828
She's a remarkable girl.

266
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,836
- Did he find her?
- Not yet.

267
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,373
But, knowing my father, he will.

268
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,512
You know that Emily
will never be safe in his care.

269
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,479
- I don't have many options.
- I'm offering to protect her.

270
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:30,053
You loved her enough to create her.
Don't you want her to have a normal life?

271
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:34,555
Of course I do.
But Emily's accelerated growth caused...

272
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,489
...severe chromosomal damage.

273
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:40,529
She has no conscience,
she has no concept of right or wrong.

274
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,496
She's dangerous.

275
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,769
Lana?

276
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,941
- Clark, what's wrong?
- Where's Lana?

277
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,054
I thought she was in the living room
doing her homework.

278
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,707
Emily, it's too slippery out here.

279
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:31,645
- It's okay, Lana, we won't get in trouble.
- You don't understand.

280
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:37,152
- We've already been out here once before.
- Is that why Daddy's mad at you?

281
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,890
It was raining...

282
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,994
...and I fell into the water
and you jumped in after me.

283
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:53,365
- Because I'm your best friend?
- Yes.

284
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,968
You kept swimming beside me,
telling me I could make it...

285
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,870
...that I'd be fine.

286
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:03,207
And when I looked back,
you were too far away...

287
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,815
...and the current was too strong.

288
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,316
Didn't you save me?

289
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,190
No.

290
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:21,156
I thought you were my best friend.

291
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:28,032
If I could go back and change that day,
I swear to you, I would.

292
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:31,300
I live every day knowing
that it should have been me.

293
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,014
This time it will be.

294
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,960
Lana.

295
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,359
Lana.

296
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,068
Oh, please.

297
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,882
Lana.

298
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,952
Lana, it's okay.

299
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,384
It's okay, it's me. It's all right.
You're okay.

300
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,719
Clark. Hold me.

301
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,270
Lex, what's the crisis? One minute,
you want nothing to do with me...

302
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,008
...and then I'm inundated
with urgent messages.

303
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,914
How does it feel to play God, Dad?

304
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,487
If I left in the middle of brunch
with the governor...

305
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,716
I know you've reopened Level 3.

306
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,417
The ominous Level 3.

307
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,995
Instead of abandoning the project
like you claimed...

308
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:36,031
...you dispersed the research
into smaller, undetectable labs.

309
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,065
How could you buy in
to such a myth, Lex?

310
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,262
Your connection to Dinsmore
is more than a myth.

311
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:44,340
You're genetically
engineering human beings.

312
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,910
Oh, Lex. Lex.

313
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:52,607
Extraterrestrials. Secret labs.

314
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,010
It's science fiction, son.

315
00:35:56,454 --> 00:36:00,083
I saw Emily Dinsmore with my own eyes.

316
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,988
If you'd kept your mind on business,
you might have noticed that the state...

317
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:12,603
...has placed the conservatorship
of the Kawatche cave under my control...

318
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,667
...effective today.

319
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,165
That's impossible.

320
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:21,475
- I was under contract for five years.
- That's what I told the governor.

321
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:25,207
But, apparently, somehow,
he's learned of a series of accidents...

322
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:30,082
...and several unfortunate deaths
that occurred under your watch.

323
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,691
I'm sorry, son.

324
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:44,394
I've tried to teach you:
Always keep a sharp eye on the ball.

325
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:59,274
- Smooth as silk. Good job, Dad.
- Thanks.

326
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,214
You realize, Clark,
this baby is gonna be one lucky kid...

327
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,650
...having you as an older brother.

328
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,082
I mean that, Clark.

329
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:12,319
Just a... Just a second.

330
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,602
Lana.

331
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,005
Hi.

332
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,805
Lana, I heard Sheriff Adams
is still looking for Emily.

333
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:29,913
But I'm concerned about you.
Are you doing okay?

334
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,881
I'm gonna be fine. Just worried about Emily,
after all she's been through.

335
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,418
- Yeah.
- I hope the police find her soon.

336
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,351
I'm sure they will.

337
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:44,289
Do you think I could borrow Clark
for a couple of minutes, Mr. Kent?

338
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,760
Yeah, I don't see why not.

339
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,671
If this is the mysterious Lana, I like it.

340
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,968
What is this all about?

341
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:02,005
Us, kind of.

342
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,275
I just wanted to thank you for yesterday.

343
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:12,786
There were a few minutes there
when I really thought I might be losing it.

344
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,222
But you never doubted me.

345
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,387
Not for a second.

346
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:24,056
You always believe in me.

347
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,032
It means a lot.

348
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:29,802
Lana, what is this all about?

349
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:35,307
It's just that sometimes I...

350
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:41,712
I feel like you've created
this perfect picture of who I am.

351
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,819
That's what I see.

352
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:53,119
This might sound silly.

353
00:38:57,234 --> 00:39:00,635
But I have this fear that...

354
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,540
That one day you'll finally get
a good look at me and...

355
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,046
I'm going to disappoint you.

356
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:19,083
That you'll see that I'm not as strong...

357
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,417
...or as good as you think I am.

358
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:31,197
And I'm afraid that it'll change the way
you feel about me.

359
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,537
Nothing could ever do that.

360
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:19,080
Maybe it's me that needs
to start believing in you.

361
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,800
We'll do better next time.

362
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:41,426
I assume this means
I can continue the project.

363
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:46,875
I don't think that would be
a wise decision, Pete.

364
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,979
You've jeopardized the research
once already.

365
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:53,708
- You said you wanted a prototype.
- Yes, I did.

366
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:56,717
And this phase has
brought us closer to our goal.

367
00:40:56,887 --> 00:41:01,620
But I don't want you working
on the project any longer.

368
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:09,056
- You're too emotionally involved.
- She's flawed...

369
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:13,432
...but she's my daughter.
- No. No, she's not.

370
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,231
She's a poor approximation.

371
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:21,366
This specimen is defective.

372
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,547
You can't take her away from me.

373
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,175
She's...

374
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:30,320
...my life.

375
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,781
She's the property of LuthorCorp.

376
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,976
Hello, Emily.

377
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,283
I don't like you.

378
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,925
You know what I think, Emily?
I think...

379
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:14,529
I think we just got off
on the wrong foot.

380
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,632
Look at this.

381
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:31,405
You want to hold him, Emily?
Go ahead.

382
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,861
Where's my daddy?

383
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:57,132
You mustn't worry about him, Emily.

384
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:02,803
I'm gonna take very good care of you.
You'll see.

385
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:14,983
What do you think
you should call your rabbit?

386
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:21,230
- Bunny Buns.
- Bunny Buns? That's a beautiful name.

387
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:28,368
This tastes good.
May I have some more?

388
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
