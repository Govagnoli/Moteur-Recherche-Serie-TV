1
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,408
Hey, Clark.
Whatcha doin'?

2
00:00:25,472 --> 00:00:26,880
Hey, um,

3
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:29,491
I'm just trying to figure out
some of this trig homework.

4
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:32,869
What for? Don't you already
have a scholarship to met U.?

5
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:36,171
Yes, for football. But they're still
gonna be looking at my final gpa.

6
00:00:36,222 --> 00:00:41,059
Well, when you're done playing with your protractor,
there's a party over at katie's house.

7
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:43,931
Her parents have a hot tub.

8
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,307
- Really?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:54,776
Thanks, but I still got
a lot of work to do.

10
00:00:57,105 --> 00:01:01,149
Okay. Well, why don't you
drop by later if you finish?

11
00:01:02,446 --> 00:01:04,010
See ya.

12
00:01:06,749 --> 00:01:08,203
Good bye Clark.

13
00:01:16,903 --> 00:01:19,285
She was cute.

14
00:01:20,535 --> 00:01:21,787
Which one?

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,181
Both. Thinking of asking
one of them out?

16
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:28,953
Yeah, so that I could ruin it just when we're getting
close by having to lie about who I really am?

17
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:30,564
Just like I did with Lana?

18
00:01:30,618 --> 00:01:33,440
Clark, there is someone
out there for you.

19
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:34,775
Who?

20
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:38,847
Mom, a girl would have to be crazy
to get into a relationship with me.

21
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:51,707
I can't believe you're thinking
about letting that psycho go.

22
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:55,869
That is what generally happens
when a patient is cured.

23
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:04,028
Alicia.

24
00:02:05,568 --> 00:02:07,258
It's time.

25
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:10,225
You can go home now.

26
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:19,645

Merci à Malone

30
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:33,845
So what's smallville's star quarterback
doing up here alone on a saturday night?

31
00:03:34,274 --> 00:03:35,741
Alicia.

32
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:38,983
I'm kinda surprised
you remembered my name.

33
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:41,620
How could I forget?

34
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:47,046
You tried to kill me.

35
00:03:47,112 --> 00:03:48,579
And Lana.

36
00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:54,497
I'd ask how you escaped, but I
guess that's pretty obvious.

37
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:56,231
I didn't escape.

38
00:03:56,462 --> 00:04:00,553
They let me out.
The doctors say I'm cured.

39
00:04:03,092 --> 00:04:06,339
You could've called,
instead of teleporting into my loft.

40
00:04:06,388 --> 00:04:09,464
Actually, I borrowed
my mom's car and I drove.

41
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,189
It's a little something
my doctor came up with.

42
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:17,063
Trace amounts of lead are
released into my bloodstream and

43
00:04:17,096 --> 00:04:19,743
keeps me from using my powers.

44
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:24,737
I'm glad they think you're better.

45
00:04:27,094 --> 00:04:29,434
That doesn't change
what happened between us.

46
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,346
I know that, Clark.

47
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:36,274
I just wanted to tell you how sorry
I am for everything I put you through.

48
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:40,516
You're the last person on earth
that I ever wanted to hurt.

49
00:04:45,395 --> 00:04:48,510
But you didn't
answer my question.

50
00:04:49,783 --> 00:04:53,129
Why are you up here alone
on a saturday night?

51
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,179
Maybe I prefer
to be alone.

52
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:03,484
Because of your secret?

53
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,907
Don't worry.
I didn't tell anyone.

54
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:11,844
I promised you that I wouldn'T.

55
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:12,916
Alicia...

56
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:16,278
the whole time I was in belle reve,
just the thought

57
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:18,949
that there was
someone out there like me,

58
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:22,869
who knew what it was like
to be different,

59
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:25,655
gave me hope.

60
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:31,180
In my darkest moment,
you gave me hope, Clark.

61
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,555
Bye.

62
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:58,532
So they just let Alicia
teleport out of belle reve?

63
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:01,813
They gave her some sort of lead bracelet
that stops her from using her powers.

64
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,128
And she doesn't seem
as dangerous anymore.

65
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:07,734
Well, her powers weren't the only thing that made
her dangerous, Clark. She's obsessed with you.

66
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,514
And she knows your secret.

67
00:06:09,564 --> 00:06:11,855
Which she kept for over a year.

68
00:06:12,448 --> 00:06:15,119
Whatever they did to her
in belle reve, maybe it worked.

69
00:06:15,152 --> 00:06:19,639
We know how much you want to be with someone
you don't have to lie to, sweetheart. But...

70
00:06:19,705 --> 00:06:21,600
Alicia isn't the one.

71
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:26,361
So, what should I do... just wait for the next cute girl
with special abilities to knock on my door?

72
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:28,916
Clark, you know what she did.

73
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:31,257
Alicia needs to be in an institution.

74
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:33,498
Then why'd they let her
out of belle reve?

75
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:37,797
What if she really is better?

76
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:40,088
And what if she isn't?

77
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:50,190
Damn, I'm good.
All right, Alicia Baker.

78
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:56,651
"Suffering from a histrionic personality disorder, causing
emotional instability, resulting in psychotic episodes. " Yeah,

79
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,929
that's our girl.

80
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,081
Who's that guy?

81
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,348
It's Alicia's psychiatrist
Dr. William Mcbride.

82
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:09,161
Yeah, I've heard of him.

83
00:07:09,197 --> 00:07:13,763
He graduated from harvard in two years
with more degrees than a thermometer.

84
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:16,928
What's he say about Alicia?

85
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:21,943
Wow. Well,

86
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:25,256
according to Dr. Mcbride,
Alicia really is cured.

87
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:30,370
She wastelling the truth.

88
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:41,671
And that, I take it, is exactly
what our young Mr. Kent wanted to hear.

89
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:02,179
What are you doing here?

90
00:08:03,436 --> 00:08:05,167
It's nice to see you, too.

91
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:07,425
Sorry, I just didn't expect you
to show up on campus.

92
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:12,341
Like I didn't expect you to say that you needed
space right before you walked out on me?

93
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,742
Jason, what's really going on here?

94
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,389
Where this is heading with us,
I just don't think you're ready.

95
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:23,438
I don't think you're ready
for a relationship like that.

96
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,565
Relationship like what?

97
00:08:26,141 --> 00:08:29,062
Can we not talk about this right now?
I don't want...

98
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:31,732
look, Lana, I have to go.

99
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:59,205
super powers can't
save you now, Clark Kent.

100
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:01,858
No, I'm good.
I'm... I'm good.

101
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:03,457
Okay, come on.

102
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:07,298
Just relax your knees.

103
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,411
Just glide.

104
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:13,680
I'm really glad that you called me.

105
00:09:14,274 --> 00:09:18,645
I didn't think that you would after what happened
the last time we went outon a date.

106
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:23,492
Well, you were sick then.
I understand now.

107
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:25,585
I don'T.

108
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,701
I mean,

109
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,662
I remember feeling

110
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,844
angry and alone and doing
all those things, but...

111
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,292
I don't know... when I think
about it now, it's like...

112
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:40,292
it's like watching a movie.
Like it wasn't even really me.

113
00:09:40,342 --> 00:09:42,369
Maybe it wasn'T.

114
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:45,867
Maybe this is the real you.

115
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:57,415
Good thing you've got buns of steel.

116
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,738
Oh...

117
00:10:06,348 --> 00:10:09,299
you might be impervious to the cold,

118
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:12,101
but I'm turning into a popsicle.

119
00:10:13,518 --> 00:10:16,175
Well, I do have heat vision.

120
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:18,796
Well, I think I'd settle
for some hot chocolate.

121
00:10:18,845 --> 00:10:19,933
Okay.

122
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,832
I'm just gonna go freshen up first.
I'll meet you over there.

123
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:25,085
Okay.

124
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:38,766
Enjoying your freedom?

125
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:40,694
Dr. Mcbride.

126
00:10:40,744 --> 00:10:42,211
What are you doing here?

127
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,016
Checking up on my favorite patient.

128
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:50,719
This does more than just
keep you in place, Alicia.

129
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:52,767
You lojacked me?

130
00:10:54,629 --> 00:11:00,679
I have to know where you are, so that you
don't do anything to jeopardize your release...

131
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:04,018
like associating with Clark Kent.

132
00:11:04,282 --> 00:11:07,084
What I do with Clark is my own business.

133
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:10,566
Clark was the object of your obsession, Alicia.

134
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:14,871
Your feelings for him are what
precipitated your psychotic break.

135
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:18,448
You really want to risk
an incident like that again?

136
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,879
But you said that I was better.

137
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:25,555
And I want you to stay that way.

138
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:29,726
Perhaps more sessions together

139
00:11:29,796 --> 00:11:32,912
outside of the office would be beneficial.

140
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:38,615
You are such a bright,
beautiful young girl.

141
00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:45,103
It'd be a shame to see you
end up back in belle reve.

142
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:50,098
Stop seeing Clark Kent
before someone gets hurt.

143
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,005
there you are.
I thought I'd lost you.

144
00:12:03,037 --> 00:12:06,151
Oh, you're not getting rid of me that easily.

145
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,524
Ooh, I let it get cold.

146
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,646
Would you mind?

147
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:21,948
thank you.

148
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,451
So, what do you want to do next?

149
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,769
Um...

150
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:33,047
You wanna go for a drive?

151
00:12:33,393 --> 00:12:36,080
Sure. Where do you want to go?

152
00:12:37,349 --> 00:12:39,607
Have you ever been to california?

153
00:12:39,822 --> 00:12:41,276
California.

154
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:49,221
Sure, let's jump in the truck,
and we'll go to california right now.

155
00:12:53,428 --> 00:12:55,258
Are you serious?

156
00:12:58,588 --> 00:13:02,432
- Alicia, going to california would be...
- Crazy?

157
00:13:02,646 --> 00:13:04,064
I wasn't gonna say that.

158
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:07,163
No, I know that it sounds crazy.
I just...

159
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:14,671
I just want to go somewhere where
nobody knows me or what I did.

160
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,984
And I want you to come with me.

161
00:13:22,473 --> 00:13:23,841
I can'T.

162
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:28,094
I mean, as much as I'd want to be with you...

163
00:13:32,286 --> 00:13:33,934
is everything okay?

164
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:41,471
I actually have to go.

165
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:45,526
I'll call you later.

166
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:20,561
well, the prodigal father returns.

167
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:24,525
I've been trying to reach you,
but you're always somehow, uh...

168
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,157
unavailable.

169
00:15:26,487 --> 00:15:29,800
Too busy playing with your sword
to speak to your father?

170
00:15:29,849 --> 00:15:33,196
Actually, I've been preoccupied
by your court papers...

171
00:15:33,262 --> 00:15:36,553
trying to unravel how you managed
to get your conviction overturned.

172
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:40,064
Well, I don't think you'll find the answers
in that stack of legal documents.

173
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:42,075
It was a, uh...

174
00:15:43,344 --> 00:15:46,215
A miracle.
There's no other way to explain it.

175
00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:51,325
And I must use that freedom
I was given towards a...

176
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,114
a greater purpose.

177
00:15:55,796 --> 00:16:00,477
Well, I hope that purpose doesn't include
returning to luthorcorp, because

178
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:06,036
you won't be walking through the door to the executive suite
or raiding the coffers to line your pockets any time soon.

179
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,502
I'm not here for money, Lex.
I don't want to take luthorcorp away from you.

180
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,980
Corporate maneuvering
doesn't interest anymore.

181
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:16,623
So, what, now trying to kill me
is going to be a full-time job?

182
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:19,808
I know... I know where
you're coming from, Lex.

183
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:22,660
It's a place of anger and mistrust.

184
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:28,499
But it's not too late. It's not. There's still time
to get off the path that can only lead to darkness.

185
00:16:28,532 --> 00:16:30,233
Come on, dad.

186
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:32,178
What are you really up to?

187
00:16:32,228 --> 00:16:35,409
I am trying to make the world a better place.

188
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:39,335
I'm going to create
a charitable foundation, not just...

189
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:42,285
to feed the hungry and clothe the poor.

190
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:46,425
No, I want to really help people,
to inspire the human spirit.

191
00:16:46,474 --> 00:16:52,095
I wish everyone on the face of the earth
could be as blessed as I am.

192
00:16:58,502 --> 00:17:00,266
So now you're the messiah?

193
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:01,502
No.

194
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,975
Lex, no, I'm just... I'm...

195
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:08,908
I'm a man who has a dream.

196
00:17:20,321 --> 00:17:22,678
Oh! Guess who?

197
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:25,612
I was starting to think you were on your way
to california already.

198
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,969
Well, my bags are in the car.

199
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:31,195
What's going on?

200
00:17:31,755 --> 00:17:33,387
Uh...

201
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:38,237
Dr. Mcbride, my psychiatrist...

202
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,413
he was at the ice rink.

203
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:46,431
He said that if I keep seeing you,
he's going to send me back to belle reve.

204
00:17:46,678 --> 00:17:48,508
Why would he do that?

205
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,052
Maybe because he's jealous.

206
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:56,894
I think, in his mind, he thought
that if I was out, he could be with me.

207
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,941
Well, go to the review board at belle reve,
and tell them about Mcbride.

208
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,879
Well, I can't risk them revoking my probation.

209
00:18:02,918 --> 00:18:05,160
What do you think they're gonna do if you run?

210
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:10,899
As long as I'm free, I don't care.

211
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,445
Come with me, Clark.

212
00:18:18,823 --> 00:18:20,916
I want to...

213
00:18:20,982 --> 00:18:24,757
but running's not the answer.
Trust me, I know.

214
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,757
I wish I was as strong as you are.

215
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,581
But...

216
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,872
I'm not.

217
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:49,639
I made something for you in belle reve...
for when I got out.

218
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:51,237
Alicia...

219
00:18:52,737 --> 00:18:56,463
I guess now it's a...
it's a goodbye present.

220
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,832
Would you mind wearing it
so I can see it on you just once?

221
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:31,498
Hey.

222
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:32,606
Hey.

223
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:34,683
I missed you in A.P. Lit today.
What happened?

224
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:39,859
You decide you just couldn't face
the love songs of J. Alfred Prufrock?

225
00:19:40,238 --> 00:19:41,959
No, um...

226
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:44,333
I went to go see Jason.

227
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:47,448
Sounds like it didn't go so well.

228
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:53,086
Sorry. But, uh, poker face isn't
exactly your strong suit. What's up?

229
00:19:55,352 --> 00:20:00,676
I think I finally figured out why
he's been so cryptic.

230
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:08,344
He doesn't think that I'm ready for...
"that" kind of a relationship.

231
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:12,330
What? What kind?

232
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:18,907
Oh, that kind.

233
00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:21,688
Oh, okay.

234
00:20:21,832 --> 00:20:26,262
Wow, that answers a question
I've been dying to ask you all semester.

235
00:20:26,345 --> 00:20:30,346
- Does everybody think that we've...
- Lana.

236
00:20:30,408 --> 00:20:35,106
You were alone with him
for three months in Paris.

237
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:39,124
Right. Um...

238
00:20:42,287 --> 00:20:44,018
Well, we haven'T...

239
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:49,705
but I'm starting to think that I'm ready.

240
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:59,109
First off, don't do this just because
you're afraid to lose him if you don'T.

241
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:02,014
It's not that.

242
00:21:03,683 --> 00:21:06,300
It's just Jason's in college,

243
00:21:06,362 --> 00:21:10,079
and I think that he's used
to relationships that are...

244
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:13,273
that area little more adult.

245
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:22,055
Well, at the risk of going "afterschool special" on you, two-thirds
of all people under the age of 18 regret doing it too soon.

246
00:21:23,414 --> 00:21:29,967
And on behalf of that two-thirds,
just be sure that you're really ready.

247
00:21:30,296 --> 00:21:32,377
Wait a minute.

248
00:21:32,851 --> 00:21:35,225
- Are you saying that you've...
- Yeah.

249
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:39,263
During my intern shipat the "daily planet. "

250
00:21:40,293 --> 00:21:45,465
His name was Jimmy.
He was very cute in a bow tie kind of way.

251
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:51,378
You know, I mean, it was... it was a summer infatuation
that I thought was the real thing.

252
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,572
Do you wish you hadn't done it?

253
00:21:55,973 --> 00:21:57,724
Sometimes.

254
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:02,069
I mean, it wasn't awful, by any means.
But it just wasn't special,

255
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,798
and as cliché as it sounds,
it only happens once.

256
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:11,979
So just make sure Jason's the guy
that you want to remember forever.

257
00:22:38,018 --> 00:22:39,378
okay...

258
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,727
can we just slow down?

259
00:22:44,302 --> 00:22:46,857
I want this to last forever.

260
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,545
I'm not sure that's one of my abilities,
but I'll do my best.

261
00:22:55,177 --> 00:22:56,825
Okay, just one minute.

262
00:22:57,588 --> 00:22:58,803
What?

263
00:23:03,213 --> 00:23:04,404
Um...

264
00:23:04,486 --> 00:23:05,866
what is it?

265
00:23:10,276 --> 00:23:12,439
I'm a virgin.

266
00:23:14,211 --> 00:23:17,903
That's great. So am I.

267
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,005
Really?

268
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:22,004
What?

269
00:23:22,065 --> 00:23:26,289
It's just... well, we don't have
any kind of commitment or anything.

270
00:23:26,378 --> 00:23:27,388
Oh...

271
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,921
Baby, no one is more committed
to making this happen than me.

272
00:23:32,683 --> 00:23:37,113
You are the most beautiful, amazing,
sexiest girl I've ever met.

273
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:39,507
And there's no way
I'm letting you get away.

274
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:43,628
Does that mean, like,
you want me to be your girlfriend?

275
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,029
No.

276
00:23:45,936 --> 00:23:48,408
I want you to be my wife.

277
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:52,379
Are you serious?

278
00:23:54,006 --> 00:23:56,706
We were meant to be together.

279
00:23:56,767 --> 00:24:01,156
We could be in vegas tonight
and wake up Mr. And Mrs. in the morning.

280
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:03,361
Oh, my god!

281
00:24:39,094 --> 00:24:44,287
We are, uh, gathered here
to join this happy couple in holy matrimony.

282
00:24:44,328 --> 00:24:48,278
Marriage, as you know, is a union
that should not been tered into lightly.

283
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,401
Yeah, yeah, skip to the good stuff, pops.

284
00:24:50,442 --> 00:24:51,966
Oh, alright. Um...

285
00:24:53,141 --> 00:24:58,869
do you, Clark Kent, take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

286
00:24:59,108 --> 00:25:00,798
Hell, yes.

287
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,164
And do you, Alicia Baker, take this man
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

288
00:25:07,267 --> 00:25:08,730
I do.

289
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:13,088
Well, you may kiss the br...
oh, I see you're already doing that.

290
00:25:13,171 --> 00:25:17,209
Well, by the power vested in me
by the state of nevada,

291
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,650
I now pronounce you man and wife.

292
00:25:38,582 --> 00:25:41,094
My head is swimming.

293
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,524
Don't drown just yet.

294
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:50,325
Oh, my god, I can't believe this!

295
00:25:50,721 --> 00:25:53,873
I'm Mrs. Clark Kent.

296
00:25:56,078 --> 00:25:57,994
Let's make it official.

297
00:26:17,846 --> 00:26:19,392
Jason.

298
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:21,699
You're early.

299
00:26:21,761 --> 00:26:26,603
I got your message. It sounded like an emergency,
so I came as soon as I could.

300
00:26:26,644 --> 00:26:29,921
This isn't exactly how I planned it.

301
00:26:43,287 --> 00:26:48,692
I need you to look me in the eye
and tell me that you don't love me.

302
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:59,433
Then there's no good reason
why we shouldn't be together.

303
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:14,193
Okay, I'm gonna stop you. Um...

304
00:27:16,212 --> 00:27:19,385
not that I wouldn't love for this to happen,

305
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,723
but it can'T.

306
00:27:23,547 --> 00:27:25,585
I mean, not like this.

307
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:28,655
Oh, ok. I don't understand.

308
00:27:28,717 --> 00:27:32,405
Um, I thought that you broke up with me

309
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:33,682
because...

310
00:27:33,744 --> 00:27:35,722
okay, all right, um...

311
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:42,136
I haven't been completely
honest with you.

312
00:27:47,143 --> 00:27:48,998
There's someone else.

313
00:27:50,996 --> 00:27:52,191
No.

314
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,842
Um... no.

315
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,066
Then what is it, Jason?

316
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:01,724
Why did you just walk out
on this relationship?

317
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:04,468
Because I don't think we met by accident.

318
00:28:05,993 --> 00:28:08,939
I think that my mother arranged it.

319
00:28:09,475 --> 00:28:11,556
How's that even possible?

320
00:28:11,597 --> 00:28:16,930
My mother was the one who convinced me to go to Paris in
the first place. She said that I would meet someone special.

321
00:28:17,012 --> 00:28:18,413
And I did.

322
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:22,761
And then everything started happening...
the tattoo and Isabelle's tomb...

323
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:24,430
and the spell book.

324
00:28:24,553 --> 00:28:26,408
None of it made any sense.

325
00:28:27,246 --> 00:28:30,871
Until you saw my mother in your nightmare
about Isabelle being burned at the stake.

326
00:28:30,912 --> 00:28:32,746
No, that was just a bad dream, that's all.

327
00:28:32,802 --> 00:28:35,752
Or maybe it was your subconscious
connecting the dots.

328
00:28:37,203 --> 00:28:38,673
Either way,

329
00:28:38,722 --> 00:28:42,415
I didn't want my mother to use me
to get close to you, so, uh...

330
00:28:42,942 --> 00:28:44,195
Jason...

331
00:28:44,327 --> 00:28:49,298
whatever's going on, it doesn't change
the way that I feel about you.

332
00:28:52,183 --> 00:28:53,370
Yeah.

333
00:30:19,022 --> 00:30:21,824
Oh, god. I love you so much.

334
00:30:22,335 --> 00:30:24,363
I know how you feel.

335
00:30:27,803 --> 00:30:29,055
Wait.

336
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:31,413
We don't have to wait.
We're married.

337
00:30:31,478 --> 00:30:32,764
No.

338
00:30:33,687 --> 00:30:35,863
I just want this to be right.

339
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:40,179
I want all of you.

340
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,498
What'd you do to me?

341
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:49,973
Okay, don't get mad.

342
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:52,803
How'd you know about the red kryptonite?

343
00:30:52,836 --> 00:30:55,062
Because I know everything
about you, Clark.

344
00:30:55,095 --> 00:30:57,798
We were meant to be together, remember?
Just like you said.

345
00:30:57,847 --> 00:30:58,869
You drugged me.

346
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,369
No, it's not...

347
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:02,928
I just didn't know what else to do because...

348
00:31:02,977 --> 00:31:06,126
because I couldn't stay,
and I couldn't leave without you,

349
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,510
so I just...

350
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,143
just thought if you could listen to your heart
instead of your head for once.

351
00:31:11,176 --> 00:31:14,625
Look, you don't even see what you did
was wrong. What's the matter with you?

352
00:31:14,674 --> 00:31:15,482
I just...

353
00:31:15,531 --> 00:31:19,768
Clark, you could've hooked up with any girl you wanted,
and you chose me. Why do you think that that is?

354
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:22,537
You dosed me with red kryptonite.
It makes me do things I don't want to do.

355
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:25,773
No! I don't think that rockforces
you to do anything, Clark!

356
00:31:25,822 --> 00:31:30,471
Maybe it dampens your inhibitions, but...
Clark Kent got himself into this situation, okay?

357
00:31:30,504 --> 00:31:33,784
Clark Kent asked me to marry him.

358
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:37,726
Clark Kent brought me up to this hotel
to make love to me.

359
00:31:39,226 --> 00:31:42,045
Well, maybe Clark Kent made a mistake.

360
00:31:47,653 --> 00:31:49,482
No. I did.

361
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:52,477
No!

362
00:31:59,827 --> 00:32:02,148
My mom hasn't heard anything, either.

363
00:32:02,345 --> 00:32:04,950
Okay, call me if you hear anything, okay, Chloe?

364
00:32:05,032 --> 00:32:06,087
Thanks.

365
00:32:06,267 --> 00:32:08,723
I warned Alicia to stay away from you.

366
00:32:08,773 --> 00:32:10,405
Dr. Mcbride.

367
00:32:10,635 --> 00:32:11,855
Where is she?

368
00:32:11,905 --> 00:32:14,826
She called me from her cell phone... hysterical,

369
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:16,853
crying that maybe she wasn't better...

370
00:32:16,903 --> 00:32:19,606
that maybe she belonged
backat belle reve.

371
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:22,785
Just where you threatened to send her
if she didn't stop seeing me.

372
00:32:23,032 --> 00:32:25,505
Alicia is my greatest achievement.

373
00:32:25,554 --> 00:32:28,604
When she came to me,
her mind was fractured and broken.

374
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,500
I made her whole again.

375
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:32,085
Now look what you've done to her.

376
00:32:32,135 --> 00:32:33,206
What I've done?

377
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:35,135
You're the reason she wanted to run away.

378
00:32:35,184 --> 00:32:38,860
No, you stalked her, you kidnapped her.
You forced her to marry you.

379
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:40,231
That's not what happened.

380
00:32:40,264 --> 00:32:41,204
Well,

381
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,990
that is what the police
will believe when I take you in.

382
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,325
What are you doing?

383
00:32:45,655 --> 00:32:46,940
To help Alicia,

384
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:51,120
I had to understand her obsession,
so I studied you.

385
00:32:51,466 --> 00:32:52,669
It wasn't hard.

386
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:57,384
The sheriff's files are filled with your unexplained
appearances at violent crime scenes.

387
00:32:57,436 --> 00:33:00,123
It's the classic earmarks of a troubled teen.

388
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:03,865
But don't worry,
they don't send kids like you to jail.

389
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:06,964
They send them to me... at belle reve.

390
00:33:11,684 --> 00:33:13,266
Clark didn't do anything.

391
00:33:13,316 --> 00:33:15,623
- What are you doing here?
- Alicia, get out of here.

392
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:17,222
Don't tell her what to do.

393
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:20,374
Clark, I know I made a huge mistake.

394
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,311
You're the only person
who's ever really known me.

395
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:24,231
Alicia...

396
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:27,202
and when I'm with you, I feel normal.

397
00:33:27,268 --> 00:33:29,921
I'll always love you for that.

398
00:33:29,971 --> 00:33:32,150
No. I'm not gonna let him
keep hurting you.

399
00:33:32,183 --> 00:33:33,832
You don't know what
you're talking about!

400
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:35,612
This stops now!

401
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,810
Alicia.

402
00:34:01,953 --> 00:34:04,808
We should really get to a hospital,
don't you think?

403
00:34:04,874 --> 00:34:08,006
Alicia, why'd you do that?
You know I could've caught that bullet.

404
00:34:08,072 --> 00:34:11,269
Because I promised you that
I'd always protect your secret.

405
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,077
Hey.

406
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:33,566
Hey.

407
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,346
How are you feeling?

408
00:34:36,483 --> 00:34:40,241
Like I just teleported
in front of a bullet.

409
00:34:41,974 --> 00:34:45,931
The doctor said you could be released today.
You might want to hold the jokes until then.

410
00:34:46,804 --> 00:34:49,507
What happened to Dr. Mcbride?

411
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:54,690
They're holding him for observation at belle reve
for trying to kill one of his patients.

412
00:34:56,173 --> 00:34:59,832
I'm so sorry about
what I did to you, Clark.

413
00:35:01,843 --> 00:35:03,113
I guess...

414
00:35:03,981 --> 00:35:07,739
I just didn't want to lose
the one good thing in my life.

415
00:35:10,558 --> 00:35:14,680
I'm not so sure that drugging me was
the best way to preserve the relationship.

416
00:35:26,572 --> 00:35:29,341
I wanted you with or without that rock.

417
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:33,577
Past tense noted.

418
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:42,531
Get some rest, okay?

419
00:35:56,557 --> 00:35:57,794
Clark?

420
00:36:01,107 --> 00:36:03,167
I really am sorry.

421
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,973
You know that, right?

422
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:09,566
Yeah, I know.

423
00:36:39,842 --> 00:36:43,517
Oh. A warm fire on a cold night.

424
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,528
There's nothing like it, is there?

425
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,348
Thanks for coming by, dad.

426
00:36:48,595 --> 00:36:51,546
I know how busy you are
with saving the world.

427
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:56,988
I was, uh, hoping that your call
was an olive branch, that we could

428
00:36:57,038 --> 00:37:00,796
reconcile, but obviously, I was wrong.

429
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:03,110
Where are you going, dad?

430
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,555
Back to the motel out by the interstate?

431
00:37:07,429 --> 00:37:08,731
Or, hey,

432
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:10,462
it's almost dinner time.

433
00:37:10,512 --> 00:37:13,911
You might still be able to make it to the mission
for your evening bowl of soup.

434
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,850
They also serve a surprisingly
tasty salisbury steak.

435
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:27,653
You know, I gotto hand it to you, dad.
When you throw yourself into a role,

436
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,055
you really commit.

437
00:37:29,108 --> 00:37:31,531
This is not an act, Lex.

438
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,937
You should know thatby now.
You've been having me

439
00:37:33,987 --> 00:37:35,751
followed since I was released.

440
00:37:35,784 --> 00:37:37,828
Which you knew I would.

441
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:44,656
I'm not playing some elaborate game, Lex.
This is my life now.

442
00:37:45,052 --> 00:37:49,436
You've stripped me of every penny I once had,
and I'm making the best of it.

443
00:37:50,861 --> 00:37:52,938
And you're right. It's, uh,

444
00:37:53,828 --> 00:37:57,273
it's about time for my evening bowl of soup.

445
00:37:59,976 --> 00:38:01,113
Dad...

446
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,931
you can stay in the guesthouse.

447
00:38:07,217 --> 00:38:08,190
Thanks.

448
00:38:10,693 --> 00:38:13,763
It'd be much easier keeping an eye on me.

449
00:38:14,884 --> 00:38:16,780
Good night, dad.

450
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:37,032
Is dad still upset?

451
00:38:38,268 --> 00:38:40,296
What do you think?

452
00:38:42,142 --> 00:38:43,691
How about you?

453
00:38:47,522 --> 00:38:49,483
I'm upset.

454
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:53,703
More than that, I'm disappointed.

455
00:38:56,198 --> 00:38:58,538
I was onred kryptonite, mom.

456
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:03,582
My god, you ran off with a girl
you barely know and got married.

457
00:39:03,615 --> 00:39:07,030
- It wasn't legal.
- That's not even the point.

458
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:11,448
Marriage is sacred, Clark.
It's about two people who trust each other

459
00:39:11,481 --> 00:39:17,239
and are willing to go through life together, no matter
how difficult it gets. I thought we had taught you that.

460
00:39:20,964 --> 00:39:23,107
You're an amazing young man, Clark.

461
00:39:23,143 --> 00:39:26,374
You make life and death decisions every day.

462
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,930
But then you turn around and... and you do this.
Why did you do it?

463
00:39:31,963 --> 00:39:34,469
Mom, there's a part of me

464
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,760
that never feels freer

465
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:38,853
than when I'm with Alicia.

466
00:39:41,952 --> 00:39:46,354
She makes me feel normal
and special at the same time.

467
00:39:47,096 --> 00:39:51,975
I know how badly you want to be with somebody.
I want that for you, too.

468
00:39:54,423 --> 00:39:56,170
I guess...

469
00:39:56,285 --> 00:40:00,406
I just expected you
to use better judgement.

470
00:40:17,846 --> 00:40:20,236
I guess I know why you're alone.

471
00:40:20,764 --> 00:40:21,934
Hey.

472
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,800
Alicia.

473
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,207
I see you're wearing
the lead bracelet again.

474
00:40:36,536 --> 00:40:39,240
Yeah.
It keeps me grounded.

475
00:40:41,168 --> 00:40:44,177
Anyway, I just wanted
to say thank you.

476
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:46,418
For what?

477
00:40:49,188 --> 00:40:52,880
For helping me be a better person.

478
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,724
I have faith in you.

479
00:41:04,669 --> 00:41:10,063
Look, I know that we can never be
together after what I did.

480
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,977
But it doesn't change how I feel.

481
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,735
And I just wanted you to know that,

482
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:24,235
for as long as I live, I'm never
going to reveal your secret.

483
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:35,970
I love you... That's all.

484
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:44,724
Alicia, wait.

485
00:41:45,535 --> 00:41:46,903
Wait.

486
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
