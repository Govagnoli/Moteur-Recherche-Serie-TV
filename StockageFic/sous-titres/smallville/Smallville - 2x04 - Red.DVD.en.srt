1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:05,536
Nothing says school spirit like a ring
that looks like it was jacked from P. Diddy.

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:08,037
- I think it looks great.
- I think we'll be lucky...

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,972
...if the glue holds through graduation.

4
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,645
I wonder if the ruby's even real.

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,017
You sure you're gonna do this?

6
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,879
I'm here, aren't I?

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,615
- What?
- I believe your dad's exact words were:

8
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:29,785
"Three hundred and fifty dollars is a lot to
spend on something you really don't need."

9
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:33,091
I earned that money. Besides,
Dad said it was my decision to make.

10
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:36,292
Which means that you're really not
supposed to buy it.

11
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:43,241
I know the first day at a new school can be
rough, so if you have questions, just ask.

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,571
So, what do you Crows do for fun?

13
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,373
Between the tractor-pulls
and the hoedowns.

14
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,846
- There's the Talon.
- Which is...?

15
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,645
A coffeehouse,
and a really cool place to hang out.

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,780
But I'm kind of biased,
because I sort of own it.

17
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,222
Gee, I'll have to check it out.

18
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:06,462
Whoa. Who is the major hottie
in primary colors?

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,595
That's Clark Kent.

20
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,629
No offense, Lana, but maybe
I could get him to show me around.

21
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,559
You feeling all right?

22
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,498
Yeah, I feel great.

23
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,329
Excuse me.

24
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,471
It's Jessie, isn't it?

25
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:50,098
Perhaps Ms. Lang didn't tell you, but
there's a dress code here at Smallville High.

26
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,573
Lame and lamer?

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,475
You think that's funny, Mr. Kent?

28
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,449
By the way, I'm not changing.

29
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,712
Well, perhaps you'd like
to discuss your attitude in my office.

30
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,391
Excuse me, Mr. Gibbons?

31
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:14,195
I think she looks really hot,
and I think that your dress code sucks.

32
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,425
Excuse me?

33
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:19,595
I mean, come on.
It's her first day, cut her some slack.

34
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,935
Besides, I don't think you
should be the one giving fashion tips.

35
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,980
Tomorrow, young lady,
proper attire or you're going straight home.

36
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,247
I guess we can finish our tour.

37
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,125
Where did that come from?

38
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,694
I don't know...

39
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,269
...but I think I liked it.

40
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,175
I'm telling you, man,
I don't know where she is.

41
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,006
Look, Kyle...

42
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,176
...I know that you want
to do the right thing...

43
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:12,256
...but Jessie and her father are fugitives
now. It's my job to bring them in.

44
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,825
What kind of U.S. Marshal are you,
anyways?

45
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,525
The kind that gets results.

46
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,734
- Okay.
- Okay? Okay, what?

47
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,665
I've heard from her once or twice.

48
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,964
She called me collect
from someplace in Kansas.

49
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,434
Where in Kansas? It's a big state.

50
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,669
All over. They were from pay phones.

51
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:36,008
Check my phone bill. That's all I know.

52
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,150
You have to believe me.

53
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,946
Relax.

54
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,517
I believe you.

55
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,523
So you'll let me go now?

56
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,390
Oh, I would, but Jessie might call.

57
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,555
And you might decide to warn her.

58
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,498
So this is what I was talking about.

59
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,139
It's right over the county line,
and they don't check IDs.

60
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,467
Dude, this is like a bar.

61
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,236
I know. You're the one who says if you
wanna have fun, you gotta take risks.

62
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,605
We can go this weekend.

63
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,374
The day Clark Kent decides to break rules,
I'll be there.

64
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,141
- All right.
- Clark, right?

65
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,254
Jessie Brooks. That place rocks.
I checked it out on my way into town.

66
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,550
- Are you planning a road trip?
- Lf we do, I'll let you know.

67
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,661
You'll need to know
how to get in touch with me.

68
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,344
In case you require a translation,
that was her hitting on you.

69
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,501
She is kind of hot.

70
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,540
Aren't you married to Lana
in your imagination?

71
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:55,144
Clark! You and Jessie
seem to be making fast friends.

72
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,085
Just trying to make
the new girl feel welcome.

73
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,889
Don't worry, Lana,
I haven't taken my eye off you all day.

74
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:08,563
So we still on for that cram session
tonight at the Talon?

75
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,403
If you're still gonna be there, absolutely.

76
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,166
I'll be there.

77
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,376
So soon as you get this shined
to your liking, I get the first ride.

78
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,486
Yep, and all the others
can just take a number.

79
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,446
Hey, where's Clark? He's really late.

80
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,790
Looking for me?

81
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:39,227
Yeah. Weren't you supposed to be here
with me, working on the garage door?

82
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,458
Dad, that'll take, like, two seconds.

83
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,770
And I thought we agreed
you weren't gonna buy that ring.

84
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,400
I thought we decided
it was my decision to make.

85
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,710
That's because I assumed
that you would make the right one.

86
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,280
Clark, that ring costs a lot of money.

87
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,045
And I'm tired of worrying
about every nickel and dime.

88
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,553
Clark, why don't you go wash up for dinner.

89
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,818
I'm not hungry.
Besides, I have chores to do.

90
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,154
What was that all about?

91
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:16,495
I think our not-so-normal son might be going
through some classic teenage rebellion.

92
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,968
Well, I think I liked dealing
with heat vision a lot better than that.

93
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,801
- Martha, that was a bad decision he made.
- But it was his to make.

94
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,707
I seem to recall a certain young man
who defied his father...

95
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,974
...and spent $500 on an old motorcycle.

96
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:36,015
Challenging him is only gonna
make it worse.

97
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,169
When I got up this morning,
I was pretty sure this was my office.

98
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:57,332
Lex! I thought you wouldn't mind
if I had a few changes made...

99
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,501
...since I'm gonna be here a while.
Go on.

100
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,170
What I mind is not being consulted.

101
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:12,185
I didn't realize I'd need
my son's permission to try to make my...

102
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,792
...situation here a trifle more bearable.

103
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:19,791
I've lost my sight.
Allow me at least a modicum of dignity.

104
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,668
Give him whatever he wants.

105
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,314
- Barkeep, I'm looking for a girl.
- Aren't we all?

106
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,917
The girl in this photo
used that phone over there.

107
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,189
Any crime in that?

108
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,452
No, but she is a teenager...

109
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:52,587
...and we both know the
legal drinking age in Kansas is 21.

110
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,497
If she comes back in, you call me.

111
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,831
The number's on the back.

112
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,416
I think we should start in the middle...

113
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,650
Hey, Clark, glad you made it. We're just
doing American history, the Red Scare.

114
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,886
Hey, can we do that tomorrow?

115
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,122
- Why, is something wrong?
- No, it...

116
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,632
It's really nice out tonight.
Let's go for a drive, go dancing.

117
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,866
Are you asking me on a date?

118
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,973
I'm asking you to have some fun with me.

119
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:42,437
This is a little unexpected,
to say the least.

120
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,473
But we really have to study.

121
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,017
Did you know when you get all serious,
your nose crinkles up?

122
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,786
It's really sexy.

123
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,453
Pete and Chloe are waiting for us.

124
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,640
- Well, let me use your sheet.
- Yeah. Maybe we should check...

125
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,308
What did you get for number five?

126
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,612
Hey, man.

127
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,410
Where are your books?

128
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,553
You guys want to go to a bar?

129
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:26,690
You can commit academic hara-kiri,
but the rest of us need to cram for this test.

130
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:29,453
You guys, high school's supposed to be fun.

131
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,563
This is not fun.

132
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:35,165
- Come on, my treat.
- When did you and the money truck hook up?

133
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:38,462
Since I decided there's no percentage
in playing poverty.

134
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,104
I'm gonna get a refill.
I'm gonna get you some decaf.

135
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,002
Here, I'll give you a hand.

136
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,871
Yeah, I have never...

137
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,546
Did you know that Chloe
had a birthmark on her cheek?

138
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,382
- No, she doesn't.
- Not that cheek.

139
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,656
Are you doing what I think you're doing?

140
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,929
- Clark, that's Chloe you're scoping, man.
- Not just Chloe.

141
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:18,971
- Come on, let's go have some fun.
- Clark, this test is half our grade.

142
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:22,977
If you want to party this weekend, I'm
with you, but right now, I need to do this.

143
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:27,848
All right. Well, when you're through with
Boring 101, give me a call.

144
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,991
You're kidding.

145
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,160
Thank you.

146
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,528
What's wrong?

147
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,137
That was the credit card company.
They were...

148
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:50,503
...calling to verify some charges that
were made on our card? Last night?

149
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,113
When did we get a satellite dish?

150
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,858
This is silk!

151
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,655
- Clark!
- Clark! Where did you get all this?

152
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:49,164
Discount Eddie's in Metropolis.
Open all night!

153
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,131
You mean to tell...

154
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:56,638
You mean you took
our credit cards and you bought all this...?

155
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,674
- You bought all this junk?
- Yeah.

156
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,745
I figured it was time I had
the cool stuff everyone else has.

157
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,677
Clark Kent, you stole from us.

158
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,840
No. I used your credit cards.

159
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,380
What's the big deal?
We don't have to pay for it right away.

160
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,785
Well, I'll tell you the big deal...

161
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,861
...the big deal is, you're gonna take all this
garbage back right now. Come on!

162
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,429
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, right.

163
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,293
After you've taken this garbage back...

164
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,164
...we're gonna have a conversation
about this new attitude you've developed.

165
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,363
Well, Dad, you can talk all you want.
I'm out of here.

166
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,612
Clark! Clark, come back here!

167
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,733
You're not going to school
dressed like that.

168
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,536
Okay. Then I just won't go.

169
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,679
Jessie, please, you're a smart girl.

170
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,975
You know we can't afford
to draw attention to ourselves.

171
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,056
Need a ride?

172
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,091
Clark?

173
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,128
Jessie.

174
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:33,369
- My hero.
- Jessie, I need you to...

175
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:02,967
Okay, what planet is that guy from
and what did he do with Clark?

176
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,673
Well, Clark...

177
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,743
...thanks for the ride.

178
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,402
Anytime.

179
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:21,285
So much for the shy and retiring Clark Kent.

180
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,013
I was just giving her a ride to school.

181
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:27,158
Say the word and
I'll save you the return trip.

182
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,389
Catch up with you later.

183
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,331
Clark Kent, chick magnet.
What's wrong with this picture?

184
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,335
People change, Pete.

185
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:45,109
- Clark, I'd like a word with you, please.
- Not right now, Dad.

186
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,810
- Get in the truck, son.
- Give me one good reason why I should.

187
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,750
Because I am your father,
and I just told you to get in the truck.

188
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,718
You're not my father.

189
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,782
You never were.

190
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,837
You all right, sir?

191
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,043
Here you go.

192
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:31,547
- I can't believe Clark would do that.
- It's like he's a whole different person.

193
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,091
- How are we gonna get him home?
- I don't know.

194
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:39,262
Fact is, if he doesn't want to come home,
there isn't much either one of us can do.

195
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,491
Here, I'll take it. I'll get that.

196
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,235
Takes your whole teenage-rebellion
theory to a new level.

197
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,203
This is more than teenage rebellion.

198
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:53,237
A change this drastic
doesn't happen overnight.

199
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,537
Martha, it's Clark.

200
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,875
All of his other abilities
cropped up overnight.

201
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,143
Do you think this is part
of his development?

202
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,288
I don't know.
But from what he said...

203
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,856
...I guess those feelings have been
boiling up for a while.

204
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,392
No, Jonathan, Clark loves you.

205
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,961
But there's something
seriously wrong with him.

206
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:16,459
I don't think another father-and-son talk
is gonna help this time.

207
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,737
Maybe Pete can help.

208
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,600
They're always together.

209
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:25,073
We should find out if he has
any idea what's causing Clark's behavior.

210
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,269
Well, we've gotta do something.

211
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,053
Lana, we need to talk.

212
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,054
Clark, please, I really need
to get these orders done.

213
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,558
Your coffee can wait.

214
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,328
I got the impression that you were
jealous when you saw me with Jessie.

215
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:52,498
Don't be ridiculous.
You can spend time with anyone you want.

216
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,768
Don't get me wrong.
I was happy you were jealous.

217
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,003
Clark, what is going on with you?

218
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,875
I've decided to tell you the truth, Lana.

219
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,416
About...?

220
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,553
- About everything?
- Try me.

221
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,517
What do you want to know?

222
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,685
For starters, how about what
happened the day the twisters hit?

223
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,925
We'll get there.

224
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,428
But right now we should concentrate
on more important things, like...

225
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,704
I've had feelings for you for a long time...

226
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:30,642
...and I know that
you've had feelings for me too.

227
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,640
So I think we should stop pretending.

228
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:39,743
So, what?
Is this supposed to be some...

229
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:43,786
...all-new Clark Kent?
- Well, that depends.

230
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,955
Do you like him?

231
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,670
Clark, l...

232
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,940
What about Jessie?

233
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,242
Jessie who?

234
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,487
You're the one I want to be with.

235
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,849
I'll pick you up at 8.

236
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,041
Pete, you are not gonna believe
what I found out.

237
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,146
Our "el cheapo" class rings are,
in fact, fake.

238
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,839
Chloe, there's something wrong with Clark.

239
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,219
More than usual?

240
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,151
Last night at the Talon,
the motorcycle...

241
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,416
...other stuff.
- What kind of other stuff?

242
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,993
The kind that has
Mr. And Mrs. Kent calling my house.

243
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,756
They're worried.
It's, like, they think he's on drugs.

244
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:03,431
Clark would have to be on drugs
to be on drugs.

245
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,234
Just be careful with that.

246
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,634
- What is it, anyway?
- My expose.

247
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:12,539
See this lovely $350 piece of
school spirit? It's a rip-off.

248
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,442
The jewelry company was substituting
worthless meteor rocks for rubies...

249
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,708
...to save money.
- Chloe...

250
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,715
...rings, red. Meteor rocks, green.

251
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,980
Not the load they found near
Hobbs Pond. Note the red vein.

252
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,121
You can read all about it
on page one of today's Torch.

253
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,464
Pete.

254
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,861
Chloe's gonna force a recall
because the rings are made from this.

255
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:43,439
- Think that's what's causing his behavior?
- Well, that's when it started.

256
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,201
Right after he slipped on the ring.

257
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,868
If the green meteor rocks
affect Clark physically...

258
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,037
...maybe the red affects him emotionally.

259
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:51,978
That explains his personality changes.

260
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,778
The longer he's exposed to the green,
the worse he gets.

261
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,046
If the same is true with the red,
God help us.

262
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:00,521
- We're gonna find him, get that ring back.
- How are we gonna do that?

263
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,752
Like you said, if he doesn't
wanna do something, we can't force it.

264
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,160
Sweetheart, I don't know,
but we have to figure out a way.

265
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:20,510
I came to shoot some pool, but it looks like
this establishment's been closed.

266
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,173
My father's presence
has required certain sacrifices.

267
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,509
- Why don't you throw him out?
- Clark...

268
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,951
...it's not like the thought
hasn't occurred to me, but...

269
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,723
...his blindness changes the situation.

270
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:40,797
Just because your father has a problem
doesn't mean he needs to ruin your life.

271
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,497
I wasn't aware a $2000 coat
came with a backbone.

272
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,536
What's going on?

273
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:51,174
I'd like to borrow the Ferrari.
Got a hot date tonight, and I wanna...

274
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,311
...rock her world.

275
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,074
"Rock her world"?

276
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,308
So, Lana at last.

277
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,078
Like you said, a man needs
to know when to make his move.

278
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,814
I'm glad you're finally
acting on your feelings, but...

279
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,959
...Lana's never struck me as a girl
to be impressed by a Ferrari.

280
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,026
Fast cars...

281
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,993
...fancy home and a ton of money
never hurt you, did it?

282
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,926
Come on, I just
want to make tonight special.

283
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:20,731
I don't know. It's a very expensive
piece of machinery, difficult to handle.

284
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,840
It's not like I'm going to...

285
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,272
...drive it off a bridge.

286
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:29,573
All you have to ask yourself is...

287
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,882
...who's more responsible than Clark Kent?

288
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,703
This place is great!

289
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,371
I guess. Not exactly what I was expecting.

290
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,411
What are you looking at?

291
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,385
Clark, I'm fine.

292
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,080
I'm fine.

293
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,554
- Want a beer?
- What?

294
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,858
- Do you want a beer?
- No! And since when do you drink?

295
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,796
If you don't wanna drink, let's dance.

296
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:27,200
Clark, this place isn't us.
Let's go somewhere else and talk.

297
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:30,102
I'll take that dance, Clark.

298
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,813
- Whoa!
- I took your advice, Lana...

299
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,846
...and checked out the Talon.
- Yeah?

300
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,416
Yeah, that's why I decided to come here.

301
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,949
- Clark, come on. Let's go.
- One dance.

302
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,957
Lana, I'll be right back.

303
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:12,043
- So do you like living in Smallville?
- It's the only place I ever lived.

304
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:17,884
Well, there's a big, bad world out there.
The right person ought to show you.

305
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,990
Anyone in mind?

306
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,262
I'm leaving.

307
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,292
Lana, we just got here.

308
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:32,195
Why don't you go get us some drinks.
We'll all have a good time.

309
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,897
You're unbelievable!
What happened to telling the truth?

310
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,338
What happened to
"Spend time with whoever you want"?

311
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,877
- Is that the way you want it?
- Sure. There's enough of me to go around.

312
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,109
- Lana...
- Is there a problem here?

313
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:50,882
Not anymore.

314
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,515
I'd let the lady go if I were you.

315
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:09,031
- You're going down, smart guy.
- I don't think so.

316
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,075
Oh, God!

317
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,016
- Oh, God!
- Help him!

318
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,521
Anybody else?

319
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,001
I can't be here when the cops get here.

320
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:42,663
Yeah, let's go pack our bags, see that
big, bad world you were talking about.

321
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,003
Let it go, man! Let it go!

322
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,812
Where were you all night?
We looked everywhere.

323
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,883
Last night was the best night of my life.

324
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,452
- We want to help you.
- Help me?

325
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,146
Help me what? Stay here on the farm?

326
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,487
Doing chores, wasting my life
for a $20-a-week allowance?

327
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:06,862
Clark, I wish you could hear yourself for
just a minute. There's something very...

328
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:09,592
...very wrong with you. It's that ring.

329
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,903
You're still upset about me
buying this stupid thing.

330
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,937
How pathetic.

331
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,335
Clark.

332
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,704
You really don't want to touch me.

333
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:23,347
Why don't you just hand it to me, then.

334
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:29,318
Clark, please, it isn't the ring itself. Chloe
found out it's made out of red meteor rock.

335
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,612
You know how the green rock
makes you sick?

336
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,190
Well, we think the red rock
is affecting your mind.

337
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,554
It's changed your personality, Clark.

338
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:40,562
So everything I've been doing and saying
is because of this?

339
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:44,031
That's right. That's why you gotta
take that thing off right away.

340
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:46,898
Take it off?
I just wish I would have found it sooner.

341
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,506
If you guys wanna
waste your life in this mudhole...

342
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,541
...that's your problem.
I'm through being poor.

343
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:55,706
We might not have
all the things that other people have.

344
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,873
- I didn't think our family was about that.
- With my abilities, I can make millions.

345
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:02,542
Sports, TV, it's all waiting for me.

346
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,019
You're the ones who
force me to hide who I am.

347
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,216
No. We are the ones
who have been trying to protect you.

348
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,293
We don't want anybody taking you away.

349
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,022
Protecting me? Using me.

350
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,229
I'm just another piece of equipment
to keep your farm going.

351
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,834
That's all gonna change.

352
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:32,716
Lex, if it's all right, I'm gonna
keep the Ferrari a bit longer.

353
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:37,685
- I'll send it back when I get myself set up.
- Whoa, slow down. Clark, what's going on?

354
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:46,060
I left home.

355
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,730
What happened?
You have a fight with your folks?

356
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,993
My parents don't understand me.

357
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,934
The truth is, there's nothing left
for me in Smallville.

358
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,236
What about Lana?

359
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,107
She's old news.
I got a new girl, Jessie.

360
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,804
Kind of sudden, isn't it?

361
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,382
You're the one always telling me
to find my destiny.

362
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:09,816
Well, one thing's for certain,
it's not here in Kansas.

363
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:13,115
So you've just packed
your stuff and you're off.

364
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:18,228
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

365
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,522
Really?

366
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,558
Why don't you fill me in.

367
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:31,169
Let's just say that when I'm through
showing the world what I can do...

368
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:35,335
...I'll have everything I've ever wanted.
I may be even richer than you.

369
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,408
Maybe you're right
to get away from your folks.

370
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,574
Maybe I should do the same.

371
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:43,949
If my father wants the mansion so much...

372
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,850
...he can have it.

373
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:49,118
- I never wanted to live in Smallville.
- You can come with me.

374
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,660
Nobody's using
the penthouse in Metropolis.

375
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,730
Clark Kent and Lex Luthor.

376
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,127
I like the sound of that.

377
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:59,134
Let me just tie up
some loose ends at the office.

378
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,864
Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.

379
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:15,177
- Hey.
- Hey.

380
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,857
So I heard from a source that you had
a big date with Clark last night.

381
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:24,387
Wouldn't call it a date when the guy
you went with leaves with someone else.

382
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:28,759
Wow. You just went
from the gossip column to page one.

383
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:33,064
Sorry, sometimes my
"glib-o-meter" goes into overdrive.

384
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:36,901
No. I guess...
You know, he's so secretive.

385
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,373
I guess I was thrown for a loop...

386
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:43,412
...by a Clark who could say all the things
that the old Clark couldn't.

387
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,877
Well, welcome to the conundrum
that is Clark Kent.

388
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:50,714
Part knight in shining armor,
part "Where did that come from?"

389
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,379
Miss?

390
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,355
- Can I get a refill here?
- Yeah. Yeah, just a second.

391
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,960
Thanks.

392
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,499
Here you go.

393
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,461
Louise.

394
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:08,328
Did you get an owner and an address
on the license plate I asked you to run?

395
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,035
Of course I know who he is.

396
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,544
Thanks. You're an angel.

397
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,177
Are you sure this is the right thing to do?

398
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:26,255
Pete, Clark would not listen to reason.
We don't have much of a choice here.

399
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,384
There's only one way
to stop the unstoppable.

400
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,960
- Yeah...
- Excuse me.

401
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,891
Mr. Kent.

402
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,931
Pete, why don't you...
Why don't you get going.

403
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,870
Lex, this is really not a very good time.

404
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,564
I understand you and Clark
have been having problems.

405
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:48,075
I don't want to be rude, but I'd prefer it
if you'd stay out of my family's problems.

406
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,874
Believe me, Mr. Kent,
I'm not trying to pry, but...

407
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,277
...Clark's my friend.

408
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,543
I'd hate to see your relationship fall apart.

409
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,051
I appreciate your concern...

410
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,554
...but Clark and I can work this out.

411
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,658
Then why is Clark hiding out
at the mansion?

412
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,100
Lex?

413
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,710
Is that you?

414
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,373
Hey!

415
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,817
Whoa, hey!

416
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,552
What do you want?

417
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,788
Lionel, go back to your room.

418
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:34,754
Better yet, pack your bags
and get the hell out.

419
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,894
I beg your pardon?

420
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,888
Lex may be too afraid to tell you,
but I'm not.

421
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,827
No one in Smallville wants you here.

422
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,266
You seem to know a lot about me.
You got a name?

423
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:50,168
- Clark Kent.
- Jonathan and Martha Kent's son?

424
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:54,801
As far as I know, they're good people.
I'm astonished they've raised...

425
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:57,709
...such a blatantly aggressive offspring.

426
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:00,373
If you like them so much,
I'm sure they'll put you up.

427
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:04,783
I hear they have a spare bedroom,
and I know they could use the cash.

428
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:08,652
You've got a lot to learn about tact,
young man, but you speak your mind.

429
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,794
That's good. It'll take you far.

430
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,725
I'm going to the top.

431
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,331
- Mr. Luthor?
- Yes.

432
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,368
I apologize for the interruption.
I'm a federal marshal. Your people let me in.

433
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,832
What can I do for you?

434
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:24,998
This man was seen last night leaving the
scene of a disturbance in your son's Ferrari.

435
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:29,044
Was that while you were
on your way to the top, Clark?

436
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,306
Where can I find this girl?

437
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,541
I've never seen her before.

438
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:43,354
Is that supposed to scare me?

439
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,497
How'd you do that?

440
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,860
You've got no idea
who you're dealing with.

441
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,532
What's happening?

442
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,679
- Who's shooting?
- Don't worry, Lionel...

443
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,610
...he missed.

444
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:08,942
I'll call security.

445
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,515
Why are you looking for Jessie?

446
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:18,219
It's not her, it's her father. They were
witness protection. They rabbited.

447
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,159
- Why?
- He's a corporate whistle-blower.

448
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,789
His former employer offered me
a million dollars if I could get evidence.

449
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,560
What kind of evidence?

450
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:30,265
Computer disks, accounting files,
memos, endless smoking guns.

451
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:33,808
Look, we can split it.
It's enough money to start a whole new life.

452
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,037
That's a great idea...

453
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,245
...but who needs you?

454
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,589
Thought you forgot about me.
Ready to go?

455
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,423
Almost.

456
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:55,691
I know about your father,
Jessie, and the disks.

457
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,392
We're not going
anywhere until I have them.

458
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,007
I don't understand. Why are you doing this?

459
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,614
The money.

460
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,842
You said you wanted to leave this town...

461
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:17,647
...and a million dollars is more than
enough money to make a fresh start.

462
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:20,824
If I give you those disks,
my dad is a dead man.

463
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,358
He was dead when he started running.

464
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:26,361
- Didn't I tell you I didn't want to split?
- You need me, kid.

465
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:30,627
I know the players, how to get the money.
Now give him the disks, Jessica!

466
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:53,683
I don't want to hurt you, son.
But I will. Get out.

467
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,951
Just like my dad...

468
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,527
...always telling me what to do.

469
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,523
I don't listen to him.

470
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:04,190
What makes you think
I'm gonna listen to you?

471
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,363
Where are the disks?

472
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:15,143
In the floorboards? In the ceiling?

473
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,107
In here?

474
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:25,050
Doesn't really matter.
I'll figure it out one way or another.

475
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,199
So why don't you save yourself
a lot of pain...

476
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:36,856
...and make it sooner.

477
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:41,198
You can kill me, you can tear this house
to the ground, you won't find those disks.

478
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,268
Jessie.

479
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,054
Please don't do this.

480
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:10,565
I never realized how easy it would be
to get everything I've ever wanted.

481
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,792
Clark!

482
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,460
Pete?

483
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,042
- It take the whole study group to find me?
- No. Lionel Luthor heard you mention Jessie.

484
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,768
Jessie, run!

485
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,412
How far is she gonna get, Pete?
A mile or two?

486
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:29,212
You know no one can get away from me.

487
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,286
Clark!

488
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:39,124
- I won't let you hurt anybody else.
- Still trying to tell me what to do.

489
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,356
Are you scared?

490
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,433
Then again,
you and Mom were always afraid of me.

491
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,768
No. We've had nothing but love for you.

492
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,905
That makes what I'm about to do
all that more difficult.

493
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:55,876
Pete.

494
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,571
Do it.

495
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,849
Pete.

496
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,817
Clark, I'm sorry.

497
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,082
Clark!

498
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,674
Dad?

499
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:36,643
It's okay, son. It's all right.

500
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,413
You okay, man?

501
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:40,623
Thanks, Pete.

502
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,188
Who is that?

503
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,595
What's...? What's going on?

504
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,792
Lex?

505
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:52,969
What's going on in here?

506
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:57,870
What...? I didn't order
any more work to be done.

507
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:02,042
- I'm putting the office back the way it was.
- You...

508
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,581
Have a drink, Dad.

509
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:14,548
Bas Armagnac, 1963?

510
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,088
It's my favorite.

511
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:24,360
There was a time when I thought our taste
in brandy was all we had in common.

512
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:25,559
And now?

513
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:28,569
I've been thinking about the months
after the meteor shower...

514
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,172
...the way people looked at me.

515
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,571
A baldheaded boy, thinking I was a freak.

516
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:35,769
Please, Lex, not another tale of your
tortured youth and how I...

517
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:37,709
How I failed you as a father...

518
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,180
Actually, you gave me
some excellent advice.

519
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:43,320
You told me to stop feeling sorry for myself.

520
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:47,821
These were the cards fate had dealt me.
It was best that I accept it and move on.

521
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:56,392
Stop acting like your blindness
gives you an excuse for self-pity.

522
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,362
So the son becomes the father.

523
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,131
No, Dad.

524
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:06,376
I'm through indulging you like a child.

525
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:11,004
My office remains my office.
You don't like it, leave.

526
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:16,950
Well. Seems I have done a better job
of raising you than I thought.

527
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,514
Or perhaps...

528
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:24,525
...you've finally learned the value
of directness from your friend...

529
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:25,923
...Clark Kent.

530
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,492
He's a very interesting young man.

531
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,237
- Hi.
- Hey.

532
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:46,275
- Here.
- Thanks.

533
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,551
I went by Jessie's.
They've completely cleared out.

534
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:54,316
Well, maybe they stopped running
and have gone to the authorities.

535
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,758
I just hope she's all right.

536
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:08,099
You know, Dad, the things that I did
and I said, I really didn't mean them.

537
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:09,803
Clark...

538
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:13,603
...the red meteor rocks might have
affected your personality, but...

539
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,070
...we gotta face it,
those feelings all came from somewhere.

540
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:21,207
Now, I know compared to Lex, we don't
have a whole lot around here, but...

541
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:24,183
...up until now, I never
really thought it bothered you.

542
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,719
Maybe it does.

543
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:29,325
Sometimes.

544
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,459
And then I remember
what's really important...

545
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,258
...and none of that matters.
No matter how crazy I got...

546
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:39,199
...you two stood by me. That's something
all the money in the world can't buy.

547
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:50,380
- But, still, it was a very close call, son.
- I know.

548
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:55,510
When I put that ring on, I felt this sudden
urge to tell the whole world my secret.

549
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:58,519
- Lex, Lana, Jessie.
- But you didn't, Clark.

550
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:01,214
I know, but the feelings are still there.

551
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:05,089
It's like I have these two identities
and I don't know which one's the real me.

552
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:07,787
The real you is the one
who came back to us...

553
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,093
...and we never had any doubt
that you would.

554
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:35,450
Nell told me you were riding, that this
is one of your favorite places. It's pretty.

555
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,228
I got a little lost along the way, but...

556
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,757
...here I am.

557
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,563
Those for me?

558
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,962
Yeah.

559
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,898
I wanted to apologize.

560
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,701
I was hoping maybe we could be friends,
like we were before.

561
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:56,904
So you thought that if you brought me
flowers, I'd pretend like nothing happened?

562
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:01,351
You have to believe me.
The things I said, the way I was acting...

563
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,111
...that wasn't me.

564
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,085
Even the part where you said
you had feelings for me?

565
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:08,922
- Lana...
- Clark...

566
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:12,620
...you can't have it both ways.
Either it was you, or it wasn't.

567
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,463
Wish I could explain, but I can't.

568
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:22,503
Story of your life.

569
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,542
Lana...

570
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,646
...I really am sorry.

571
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,040
I know you are.

572
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,681
It's not enough anymore.

573
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,214
Do you think you can
find your way home?

574
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:45,689
Hope so.

575
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
