1
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,280
You know, it belonged
to Alexander the Great.

2
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,440
They say the design symbolizes
strength and courage.

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,640
Can't exactly see myself going into
battle with that on my chest.

4
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Darker times call for darker methods.
His opponents thought he was invincible.

5
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,120
- I didn't know you were a history buff.
- I'm not. I'm interested in people...

6
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,680
...who ruled the world before age 30.
- Don't worry, Lex, you have a few years.

7
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,800
Lana, I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

8
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,040
Didn't Lex tell you?

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,320
Must've slipped my mind.

10
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,160
Why don't I leave you two alone?

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,560
Having fun?

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,560
Yeah, well, I'm feeling
a bit underdressed.

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,560
If it makes you feel any better,
Whitney is just as uncomfortable.

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,000
Whitney came too.

15
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,400
Why don't you join us? I'll yank Nell
away from the jewellery so we can eat.

16
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,760
Yeah, sure.

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,760
Clark, where are you going?

18
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm gonna get some air.

19
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,840
You're never gonna get her if you
keep running away from your enemy.

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,600
Whitney's not my enemy.

21
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,800
Yes, he is. The sooner you realize that,
the sooner you'll find a way to win Lana.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,760
Remember, keep your friends close
and the quarterback closer.

23
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,120
Always the hopeless romantic, Lex.

24
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,280
Victoria?

25
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,200
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,120
Clark Kent, this is Victoria Hardwick,
a very old friend.

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,480
Hi.

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,440
Champagne?

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,800
How close are you gonna keep her?

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,800
I'll catch up with you later, Clark.

31
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,680
Want a private tour?

32
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,720
I thought you'd never ask.

33
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,760
You see this? I'm the only reason
you're not in a cage right now.

34
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,920
Now you get into the IA,
and you get me those files.

35
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,520
Why, is one of them yours?

36
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,600
You've got 24 hours to get creative.
Start thinking.

37
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,320
Well, welcome to Metropolis.

38
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,200
More or less.

39
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,760
Rogue

40
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,720
Dad, let me help you.

41
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,880
Don't break a sweat.

42
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,080
So, night owl, how was Metropolis?

43
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,680
- Fine.
- Come on...

44
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,280
...a reception at the Metropolis Museum,
and it was fine?

45
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,440
The museum was amazing.
It's just...

46
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,960
It's just what?

47
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,560
Something happened.

48
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,720
It could've been worse. I stopped
the bus before anyone was hurt.

49
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,280
- Clark, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

50
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,720
- What if somebody'd seen you do it?
- Everyone was still in the museum.

51
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,000
I think it's fine. There's no mention
of witnesses in the paper.

52
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,040
I'd better get to school.

53
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,080
Hey, Clark, look, I am real proud
of what you did.

54
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,280
We both are.

55
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,840
Did you bring them?

56
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,440
You know I'm not supposed to do this.

57
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,160
And I'm not the one with the DUI
on my record.

58
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,480
You wouldn't believe
how many rent-a-cops...

59
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,280
...forget to fill out the previous
criminal-record section on their job apps.

60
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,160
So, what do you think of Smallville?

61
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,160
It reminds me of the village
where my grandparents live in Wales.

62
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Very quaint. Very safe.

63
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,280
And the last place I expected
to find Lex Luthor.

64
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,080
My father'll bring me back
to Metropolis in a few years.

65
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,320
- He's lying.
- I know.

66
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,280
You deserve something better.

67
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,920
And you crossed the pond
to tell me what that is.

68
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,600
Catching up with an old friend
isn't reason enough?

69
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,160
As much as I'd like to flatter myself...

70
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,920
...the daughters of multinational
industrialists usually don't...

71
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,600
...fly around the world
to rekindle old flames.

72
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,160
Neither do executive vice presidents.

73
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,200
- Then you've heard.
- That you're working for your father?

74
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,480
I keep up. How is Sir Harry?

75
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,080
Distant, inaccessible and rich.

76
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,040
- I believe you know the type.
- What's he want with me?

77
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,320
He understands you may have certain
negative feelings towards your father.

78
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,560
Sir Harry has always had
an incredible grasp of the obvious.

79
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,680
He was hoping those feelings might work
to our mutual advantage.

80
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,440
He'd like you to reconsider
your position with LuthorCorp.

81
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,840
So he sent you here as an incentive.

82
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,440
I've missed you, Lex.

83
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,560
I'm touched.

84
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,560
Do you have a proposal?

85
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:38,240
First, I think I'd like something else.

86
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,920
- Another scathing editorial?
- Is there any other kind?

87
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,080
Clark, what happened to you last night?

88
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,240
I wasn't feeling well.
Guess I'm not much of a city guy.

89
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,320
You can take the boy off the farm, but
you can't take the farm out of the boy.

90
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,400
Sullivan, is this your idea of a joke?

91
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,320
- Parents have been calling all morning.
- What are you telling them?

92
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,440
What the EPA and other
environmental groups said years ago:

93
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,080
The meteor rocks are harmless.

94
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,360
People should know about the strange
things happening in this town!

95
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,720
The Torch is a school paper.
It's not your own personal tabloid.

96
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,040
Are you censoring me?

97
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,760
I'm requiring you to do your job, which is
to report on relevant school events:

98
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,000
Sports. Dances. Clubs.
I'm relieving you of your duties.

99
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,520
The Torch is suspended
until I can appoint a new editor.

100
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,800
- Okay, what just happened?
- I think you were fired.

101
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,960
Chloe, I'm sure we can do something.

102
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,520
Let me talk to Kwan.

103
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,080
Not to sound ungrateful,
but what can you do?

104
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,160
I don't know, but let me give it a shot.

105
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,240
Afternoon, Lex.

106
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,240
Or is it Mr. Luthor here in Smallville?

107
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,200
Phelan...

108
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,480
...isn't Smallville a couple of counties
outside your jurisdiction?

109
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,720
Well, I don't need jurisdiction
to look up an old friend.

110
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,640
We were never friends.

111
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,040
If you want to see me, call my office.

112
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,320
- When does it happen, Lex?
- When does what happen?

113
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,640
When do you turn on the people
that help you?

114
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,880
How many times did I pull you back
from the edge?

115
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,040
You'd be dead right now
if it wasn't for me.

116
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,840
You were on my father's payroll,
his go-to guy in the department.

117
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,840
You got paid to fix situations, so don't
try and pretend it was anything else.

118
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,840
You have a good life here, Lex.

119
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,360
I'd sure hate to see that
get compromised.

120
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,480
You can't touch me, and you know it.

121
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,840
I'm looking for a witness.

122
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,120
I think he saw last night's accident
outside the museum.

123
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,880
And this concerns me why?

124
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,920
Sorry, I don't know who that is.

125
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,200
I'd have pegged you for buddies.

126
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,600
Guess you're losing your instinct.
Maybe you should think about retiring.

127
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,960
Hello?

128
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
Hello?

129
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,080
Anybody home?

130
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,000
Dad?

131
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
Is that you?

132
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,360
Metropolis Police.

133
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,200
Kid, I don't know
what they've been feeding you...

134
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,800
...but that was pretty impressive.

135
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,480
Not quite as exciting as last night,
but I wanted to be sure.

136
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,360
Who are you?

137
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,600
I am your new best friend, Clark.

138
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,600
How do you know my name?

139
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,960
I asked around.

140
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,960
That's the beauty of a small town,
everybody's just so eager to help.

141
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,600
Far cry from Metropolis.

142
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,440
- What do you want with me?
- Your help.

143
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,880
You see, Clark, I'm in a battle
that I can't afford to lose...

144
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,520
...because if I do,
well, the bad guys win.

145
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,560
And you have this gift that I need.

146
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,520
I'll never help you.

147
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,400
You have a secret you don't want
the world to know about.

148
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,360
I'm guessing that's why you didn't stick
around for the TV cameras last night.

149
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,240
You want to keep things that way,
you'll do like I say.

150
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,160
Drop by that overpriced coffee shop
tomorrow afternoon...

151
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,640
...and we'll talk about your future.

152
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,080
Nice catch.

153
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,360
So he just dropped the generator
right on top of you?

154
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,520
How did he know it wouldn't kill you?

155
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,600
He saw me stop the bus last night.

156
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,080
Maybe we should call the police.

157
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,360
He is the police. I saw his badge.

158
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,920
Metropolis P.D.

159
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,440
Dad.

160
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,480
I didn't mean for this to happen.

161
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,920
Clark, you didn't do
anything wrong, okay?

162
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,400
He told me to meet him
at the Beanery tomorrow.

163
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,240
I don't want you going
anywhere near this guy.

164
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,280
I'll talk to him,
and I'll find out what he wants.

165
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,480
Until then...

166
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,400
Until then, you live your life,
you see your friends.

167
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,160
Now, we're not gonna let
this thing change us.

168
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,720
You look like you're carrying
the weight of the world.

169
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,920
I'm sorry if I surprised you,
but there's really nowhere to knock.

170
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,600
It's okay. Thanks again for last night.

171
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,440
Your first visit to Metropolis, and you're
involved in a police investigation?

172
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,520
That has to be some kind of record.

173
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,800
- How'd you know about that?
- The detective came to see me first.

174
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,040
What'd he tell you?

175
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,000
Not much.

176
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,360
Maybe that's what's bothering me.

177
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,640
What do you mean?

178
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,880
Metropolis Police don't send detectives
to investigate traffic accidents.

179
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,800
So I made a call. Turns out the official
investigation is already closed.

180
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,040
Clark, you really don't want
Sam Phelan in your life.

181
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,400
You know him.

182
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,840
Unfortunately.

183
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,120
I had my share of legal problems
while I was in Metropolis.

184
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,480
- Serious?
- Expensive.

185
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,080
Phelan was the kind of officer
my father felt we could turn to for help.

186
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,360
He's a dirty cop.

187
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,000
He'll do whatever it takes
to get the job done.

188
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,640
Plant evidence. Falsify reports.
Anything is fair game.

189
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,240
And if he's got something on you,
Clark, he'll use it.

190
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,080
He just wanted to talk.

191
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,040
Then you've got nothing to worry about.

192
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,160
Hey, Mr. Kent.

193
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,600
Mr. Kent?

194
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,200
Sam Phelan, Metropolis P.D.

195
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,080
I figured you'd be the one to show.

196
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,520
- What do you want?
- We're both rational adults.

197
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,360
- Let's sit down, talk...
- I don't think a rational adult...

198
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,760
...drops a generator on top
of a teenage boy, do you?

199
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,280
Well, we both know
it wouldn't hurt him.

200
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,040
All right, what do you want?

201
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,960
I just want Clark's help.

202
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,280
With what?

203
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,040
Look around you, Mr. Kent.
You know what you see?

204
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,480
The veneer of safety. Now, people
like me are sworn to protect that.

205
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,800
I'm the guy standing between criminals
and respectable citizens like yourself.

206
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:55,040
Now, Clark has a gift...

207
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,560
...and I would like to use his talents
to further my cause.

208
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,320
I will not let you exploit my son.

209
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,760
I've spent the morning going
through the local police files.

210
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,200
Clark's name comes up quite a bit.

211
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,680
Clark has never been in trouble
a day in his life.

212
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,600
No arrests, but he's been
around a lot of crime scenes.

213
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,760
Now, maybe that's coincidence...

214
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,080
...or maybe it's just his natural instinct
to get involved.

215
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,680
Okay, I will give you whatever you want.
You just stay away from my family.

216
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,480
I want your son.

217
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,880
No.

218
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,160
I'll be in touch.

219
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,720
Of course, if you don't agree,
I will tell the world what I know.

220
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,960
Best case, Clark's under a microscope.
Worst case, he's a freak in a jar.

221
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,480
Either way, his normal life is over.

222
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,720
Do not push me!

223
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,640
Easy there, Mr. Kent.

224
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,800
We were just talking.

225
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,040
You know, if I were you,
I'd learn to keep that temper in check.

226
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,840
It could get you in a lot of trouble.

227
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,360
Hey, Clark, you okay?

228
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,440
Fine, just doing a little research.

229
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,800
Have you heard about
Lana's meeting with Kwan?

230
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,440
Chloe, I'm sure it'll work out.

231
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,280
Hey.

232
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,200
- So how'd it go?
- Well, it's interesting.

233
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,360
When can we send out the next issue?

234
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,360
Day after tomorrow.

235
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,560
Cool.

236
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,680
Except...

237
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,680
...Kwan made me the new editor.

238
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,520
Okay, rewind. I need you to say
that last part again.

239
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,760
After I made my case, Kwan said
that if I had that much passion...

240
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,280
...I should be in charge.

241
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,400
I don't believe this!

242
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,480
It's the only way he'd reopen the paper.

243
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,520
So, what? Cheerleading's not enough?

244
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,280
Maybe the editor of a school newspaper
looks better on a college application.

245
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,720
That isn't it! I figured
you could ghost-write...

246
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,800
...until we got you reinstated.
- So then I would work for you.

247
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,720
- The paper would still be yours.
- Wait, wait.

248
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,960
Chloe, think about it. It's not a bad idea.

249
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,240
It figures you'd side with her.

250
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,840
- I'm not taking sides.
- Right.

251
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,160
You're completely objective
in all things Lana.

252
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,680
- Gotta go.
- No, please, Clark, stay!

253
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,760
- Take my desk!
- Chloe...

254
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,240
...this isn't what you think.
- You know what the weirdest part is?

255
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,000
For a millisecond, I almost thought
you were my friend.

256
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,160
Get in, kid.

257
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,520
- What do you want?
- Your father came to see me.

258
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,040
He seemed like a really good man,
always putting his family first.

259
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,360
You know, if I were you,
I'd start thinking like him.

260
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,560
I assume you've had a chance to read
my father's proposal.

261
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,200
I didn't have to.

262
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,640
So you've added mind reading
to your many abilities.

263
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,960
I know why you're here, Victoria.

264
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,800
Sir Harry wants to take over LuthorCorp,
and he needs my shares to do it.

265
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,360
Your father didn't dream up
this little plan, did he?

266
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,640
Do you think if you
take over LuthorCorp...

267
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,080
...Daddy will finally give you
the respect you deserve?

268
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,800
He won't, Victoria.

269
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,320
So, what are you suggesting?

270
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,840
You came to play on
my hatred of my father.

271
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,880
Now I'm going to play on yours.

272
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,760
Why take one company,
when you can take two?

273
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,080
You know they'd probably kill us.

274
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,840
Probably.

275
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,320
But that's what makes
life interesting.

276
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,960
What are we doing here?

277
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,880
You want to know the biggest obstacle
to my job, Clark?

278
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,960
It's not the perps. It's the bureaucracy.

279
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,960
How am I supposed to fight crime
with one hand tied behind my back?

280
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,960
You said we were going after bad guys.

281
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,960
We are. They're called Internal Affairs.

282
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,800
In fact, the head of the IA division...

283
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,400
...lives right up there on the fifth floor.

284
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,720
I'm not gonna hurt anybody!

285
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,800
Relax, you're just gonna help me
retrieve some files.

286
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,880
See, these IA types, they have
a real trust problem.

287
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,920
Well, it turns out the deputy chief keeps
all his most sensitive case files at home.

288
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,760
The man's got a safe, so you find it.
You open it...

289
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,680
...and you bring me whatever's inside.

290
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,800
You do this one thing for me,
and I'll never trouble you again.

291
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,160
I know what you're about, Phelan.
Lex Luthor told me.

292
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,440
Yeah, well, your friend Lex isn't exactly
on the side of the angels.

293
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,920
He's got his secrets, just like you.

294
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,520
It's apartment 517.

295
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Hey, Phelan!

296
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,200
Want your file?

297
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,480
It's all yours.

298
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,160
Did you call them?

299
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,000
You're making a big mistake, kid.

300
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,400
Morning, guys.

301
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,080
What time did you get in last night?
I didn't hear you.

302
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,760
Late.

303
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,480
I was helping Lana at the Torch.

304
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,920
I sort of lost track of time.

305
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,120
Clark, has Phelan tried to contact you?

306
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,720
Dad, don't worry, I think
he's out of our lives forever.

307
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,640
Ethan, Bob...

308
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,600
...what's going on?

309
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,160
We got a warrant.

310
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,840
It's a warrant to search
your property, Jonathan.

311
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,360
A warrant? Come on in.

312
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,360
What for?

313
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,120
We got a tip from Metropolis P.D.

314
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,640
You'd better come
and take a look at this.

315
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,960
Looks like he was shot in the heart.

316
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,040
You wanna explain what a dead body's
doing in your barn?

317
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,240
- I've never seen that man before.
- Ethan, we found this...

318
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,720
...hidden under the seat in the truck.

319
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,440
That is not my gun, and I have
no idea how it got in my truck.

320
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,960
I'm sorry, but we
have to place you under arrest.

321
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,320
Dad.

322
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,400
It's all right.

323
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,080
Call Bill Ross and have him
meet me at the jail.

324
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,000
You're not taking him!

325
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:12,280
Clark. Clark, I need you to stay here.

326
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,600
And I need you to be strong.

327
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,440
I'll follow in the car.

328
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,400
That's what you get for trying
to be a hero, Clark.

329
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,520
You're a pretty smart boy,
but you forget...

330
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,600
...I've been doing this a long time.

331
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,720
- Who's that man?
- Did you really think...

332
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,520
...that you could double-cross me?
Clark, my job is about scenarios.

333
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,800
You never enter a crack house
with one plan.

334
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,800
You go in with 10.
That's how you survive.

335
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,480
The truth is, kid, you didn't leave me
with a lot of options!

336
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,800
- I want my dad out of jail.
- You complicate my life?

337
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,400
I'm gonna complicate yours!

338
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,600
Call them now and tell them
what you did!

339
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,440
What is it, Clark? You wanna kill me?

340
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,000
You think that's the answer
to your problems?

341
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,320
I want him out!

342
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,000
Well, then, we both want something...

343
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,080
...only you have a lot more to lose.

344
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,200
I don't want any more surprises.

345
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,760
I'm gonna let you think about last night.

346
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,400
Stay close. I'll be in touch.

347
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,840
Clark, what are you doing here?

348
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,800
Hiding out.

349
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,920
I heard about your dad.
I know it isn't true.

350
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,880
Thanks.

351
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,200
How are you doing?

352
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,480
To be honest, I'm in way over my head.

353
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,000
All I wanted to do is help Chloe. Now
I feel like I've screwed up everything.

354
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,520
Guess that's what you get
when you try to be a hero.

355
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,600
I know the feeling.

356
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,080
You ever think your aunt's life would be
simpler if she hadn't adopted you?

357
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,360
Clark, what's going on?

358
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,840
Just seems like all I ever do is
complicate my parents' lives.

359
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,760
You can't blame yourself
for what's happening with your dad.

360
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,600
Every family goes through rough times.

361
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,000
When I was 10,
I tried to run away to Metropolis.

362
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,920
Nell found me at the bus stop.
It was freezing.

363
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,840
As she was driving me home,
I asked her if she regretted adopting me.

364
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,760
She stopped the car.
I remember because it started snowing.

365
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,840
She looked me in the eye.

366
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,600
She said it was the best thing
she had ever done.

367
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,440
She didn't love me any less
because I was adopted...

368
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,360
...but she worried about me more.

369
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,200
I've gotta go.

370
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,200
Don't worry, Clark.

371
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,160
It'll all work out.

372
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,960
Right in here.

373
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,120
Hi, son. Where's your mother?

374
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,640
The police are questioning her.

375
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,400
I lied to you.

376
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,840
- What do you mean?
- I did see Phelan again.

377
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,240
When?

378
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,880
Last night. I went with him
to Metropolis.

379
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,520
I broke into an apartment,
found a safe with confidential files.

380
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,000
Oh, Clark.

381
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,480
I didn't have a choice.

382
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,960
That's what he wanted you to think,
but you always have a choice.

383
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,680
I was protecting you and Mom.

384
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,040
You can not protect your mother and I
by lying to us. Come on!

385
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,600
Dad, there's more.

386
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,800
Phelan came back after you
were arrested.

387
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,120
I got so angry that I grabbed him...

388
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,640
...and for a second, I wanted to...

389
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,240
I wanted to kill him.

390
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,800
But you didn't, right?

391
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,520
Yeah, but I was close.

392
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,320
Believe me, son, I know all there is
to know about losing your temper.

393
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,080
But you can't afford to do it.

394
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,840
This is Phelan's game, and he
will play your fear and your anger.

395
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,080
But you cannot let him get to you.

396
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,160
I don't care. I won't let anybody hurt
you and Mom.

397
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,920
And he knows that.

398
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,920
But once you've crossed that line,
there's no going back.

399
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,400
Clark, I just heard about your dad.
Is he all right?

400
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,600
He's hanging in there.

401
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,120
This is crazy.
Your father didn't kill anyone.

402
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,120
Give me five minutes, I'll get
the 10 best lawyers in the state.

403
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,320
I don't think lawyers are gonna help.

404
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,600
It's Phelan, isn't it?

405
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,040
- What's he got on you, Clark?
- Just stay out of it, all right? Please.

406
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,680
Listen to me.

407
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,000
You may think you know
how Phelan works, but you'd be wrong.

408
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,680
Sounds like you're an expert.

409
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,800
- I understand his world.
- Yeah, he told me you have secrets.

410
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,480
There are parts of my life
I'm not proud of, Clark...

411
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,160
...but I don't want to see you
or your family hurt.

412
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,000
Now, let me help.

413
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,520
You can't, Lex.

414
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,760
I gotta handle this on my own.

415
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,760
You busy, Clark?

416
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,760
- What do you want from me?
- That's complicated.

417
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,280
After last night, I've got
Internal Affairs asking me...

418
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,360
...more questions than I want to answer.

419
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,560
That's your problem!

420
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,360
No, it's our problem.

421
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,120
But our next bit of business
is gonna be our last.

422
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,440
Look, I don't care.
You can tell the whole world about me.

423
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,880
Clark, you may not care about yourself,
but think about your parents.

424
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,160
Now, your father's in jail
on a murder charge.

425
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,040
Whether he beats it or not, he's gonna
lose this farm just paying legal fees.

426
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,480
I can still make all that go away.

427
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,920
So, what's it gonna be?

428
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,000
What are we doing here?

429
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,800
Since I couldn't pick up
my Internal Affairs records...

430
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,680
...I figured it was time to pick up
my retirement package.

431
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,840
The breastplate. You want me
to steal it for you.

432
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,120
I don't give a damn
about the breastplate.

433
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,120
I just want the 10 million dollars
worth of jewels that are on it.

434
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,200
Come on.

435
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,400
So we're just gonna bust in?

436
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,520
Metropolis P.D. Keeps blueprints on
the high-security buildings in the city...

437
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,800
...so I know this place better
than the architect.

438
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,560
The security system all runs
through this junction box.

439
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,440
- Open it up.
- Isn't it alarmed?

440
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,000
They only alarm things they think
somebody could get through.

441
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,320
And, Clark, I'm getting pretty bored
with this.

442
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,760
You want your old life back, you do it.

443
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,960
Camera's are one thing.
What about the guards?

444
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,840
They're about to get real busy.

445
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,920
Yeah, Metropolis Museum? You have
two minutes to leave the building.

446
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,280
There's a bomb outside.

447
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,760
There's a bomb out here!

448
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,440
Cameras are all dead in Luthor Hall.

449
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,120
Kid, show me the magic.

450
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,000
Standing by. Standing by.

451
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,760
We are gonna make a great team.

452
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,680
We'll never be a team.

453
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,040
You might be able to explain the safe,
but your prints are on that breastplate.

454
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,640
You might be strong,
but you're not bulletproof!

455
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,120
What are you?

456
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,520
In there!

457
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,960
Get down! Get down!

458
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,840
Phelan, where's Clark?
I know he came with you.

459
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,600
Just tell me what you had on him.

460
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,880
Go to hell, Luthor.

461
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,800
All the charges have been dropped.

462
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,080
With apologies from the state
and Metropolis Police departments.

463
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,080
Then it's finally over.

464
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,760
Well, this time.

465
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,120
Unfortunately, there's more than
one Phelan out there in the world.

466
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,680
What do we do next time?

467
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,920
I don't know, son.

468
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,320
We'll have to deal with it
when the time comes.

469
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,600
Maybe I should stop using my gifts.
That would solve our problems.

470
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,440
No, it wouldn't, Clark.

471
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,680
Your gifts are who you are.
You can't live in fear.

472
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,000
Although a little caution wouldn't hurt.

473
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,400
Clark, are you sure
nobody saw you last night?

474
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,840
I'm positive, Mom.

475
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,880
Miss Lang, what's this?

476
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,600
- It's a news story.
- It's totally unacceptable.

477
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,840
Why? It covers all of your criteria.

478
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,480
It deals with a student
and a school-sponsored club...

479
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,280
...and there are no mutants in sight.

480
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,000
Did you do this because you thought
I'd reinstate Miss Sullivan?

481
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,640
I did this
because it's the right thing to do.

482
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,560
Chloe was born for this job.

483
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,800
Although I do admire her passion,
her reporting lacks accuracy.

484
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,480
I can work on that.

485
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,680
If you want your job back, Miss Sullivan,
don't print what you can't prove.

486
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,920
- Do we have a deal?
- Yeah. Thank you, Principal Kwan.

487
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,160
Don't thank me. Thank Miss Lang.

488
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,160
Congratulations. You deserve it.

489
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,920
Thanks.

490
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,560
You know, Lana, I'm sorry I flipped out
at you the other day.

491
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,000
I just... You know, the paper's
kind of my identity...

492
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,600
...and it's the only thing
Clark and I do together.

493
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,360
And so when I saw you here...

494
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,200
You thought I was trying
to cut Clark out of your life?

495
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,120
Nobody ever said I was rational.

496
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,280
I want to be friends with you, Chloe...

497
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,840
...but I don't want to stand
between you and Clark.

498
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,360
Oh, no. Don't worry,
there's nothing between us.

499
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,360
We're just good friends.

500
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,040
How about you?

501
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,920
Same thing. We're just friends.

502
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,560
Good. I'm glad we got that
out of the way.

503
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,400
Now, let's see what you've messed up
since I've been gone.

504
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,160
Lex, are you gonna come to bed?

505
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,480
In a minute.
