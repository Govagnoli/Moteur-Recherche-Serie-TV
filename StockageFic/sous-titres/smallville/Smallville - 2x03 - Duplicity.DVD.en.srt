1
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,337
Lex...

2
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:44,400
...I thought we had an arrangement.
Why this sudden urge for a face-to-face?

3
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,477
You don't look well.

4
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,281
Why did you pull me away from
my research? I hate progress reports.

5
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,047
I hear you're having
personnel problems at Cadmus Labs.

6
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,055
They quit when you turned violent,
started throwing equipment.

7
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,160
No. They were incompetent.
I thought our relationship was clear.

8
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:05,229
You write the checks,
I have free rein to do my work.

9
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,559
I hired you to research the meteor rocks.

10
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,259
Instead of results,
you provide potential lawsuits.

11
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,099
Frankly, doctor, you've become a liability.

12
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:18,337
Look, I'm afraid we've reached
the end of our road together.

13
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,378
Now that I'm running my own company,
I don't have time...

14
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,607
...to pursue projects that don't bear fruit.

15
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,445
I suggest you see a doctor.
I'll take care of the expenses.

16
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,851
I don't need your doctor,
and I sure don't need your condescension.

17
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,457
It's you who needs me.
You're just a little too...

18
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,427
...myopic to see it.

19
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,974
Hey, man. Are you all right?

20
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:14,045
Clark, you're dreaming if you think
you're gonna make a basket from there.

21
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,976
No, no, the ball rolled out here.

22
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:21,009
- Wanna play a game of horse?
- Forget it. We're borrowing your dad's truck.

23
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,655
- For what?
- I'll explain on the way. There's no time.

24
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,315
- What's going on?
- You gotta see it with your own eyes.

25
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,964
Pretty mind-blowing, huh?

26
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:42,903
What do you think it is?

27
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:46,303
Oh, Clark, it's a spaceship.
What the hell else would it be?

28
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,540
I didn't know if it was some downed
specialty aircraft or a Russian satellite.

29
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,914
No, no, no, this thing's got
extraterrestrial written all over it.

30
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,990
I bet there's little green guys
running around the cornfield too.

31
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,053
I'm serious, Clark.
Have you ever seen anything like it?

32
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:05,187
If aliens came, they'd find a place
more exciting than Smallville.

33
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,698
No, no, think about it.
Crop circles, cattle mutilation.

34
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,929
They'd be like kids in a candy store here.
Come on, man, let's load it into the truck.

35
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,734
- Wait, you're not just gonna take it.
- Clark.

36
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:19,776
When the sheriff questioned me, I told him
I couldn't remember where the truck...

37
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:23,347
...went off the road, but it's only
a matter of time before he shows up.

38
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,317
Come on.

39
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,884
- Come on.
- All right, we'll take it to my house.

40
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,887
No, Clark. I know your dad.

41
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,255
- He'll make us give it to the authorities.
- He won't know it's there.

42
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:40,092
We're taking it to my house. We'll hide it
in the tool shed. No one goes back there.

43
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,497
Pete, my house would be perfect.
It'll be safe there.

44
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,371
Clark, last time I checked,
I found this thing.

45
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,668
You're acting like you got license
and registration on it, man.

46
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,708
Lighten up. We're taking it to my place.

47
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,552
Right here.

48
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,719
Lex?

49
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,125
- Are you in here?
- Yeah, Dad, I'm right here.

50
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,435
I'm sorry, I wasn't expecting you.

51
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,071
No. Get out.

52
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,266
Is everything all right?

53
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,312
Doctors tell me
your recovery's going well.

54
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,643
Oh, it is. So well, in fact, that...

55
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,944
...Dr. Rawlings suggested I...

56
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,913
...take a break from the...

57
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,017
...rigors of...

58
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,448
...physical therapy. He...

59
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,183
He thought that some time away from the...

60
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:46,226
...stress of living and working
in Metropolis would be more...

61
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,030
...beneficial right now.

62
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,702
And of all the places
you could have gone...

63
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:55,174
...you decided to come here?
- We'll have a chance for some...

64
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:59,868
...father-son bonding. You've always told
me I've been lax in that department, Lex.

65
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,936
How long you planning to stay?

66
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,639
A few days. Maybe a week.

67
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,721
Are you sure you wouldn't be
more comfortable at the beach house?

68
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,180
I think the sea air would be invigorating.

69
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:17,720
I'm getting the distinct impression, Lex,
that you don't want me here.

70
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,193
No, Father, I just want what's best for you.

71
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,702
Stay as long as you like.

72
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,351
No.

73
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,386
Hey, Lana, I was just thinking...

74
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:52,622
...if you moved those tables away from the
counter, it'd open up space for extra stools.

75
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:56,234
- More customers, more cash flow.
- That's a wonderful idea, Dean.

76
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,702
I gotta go.

77
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,907
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

78
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,205
- Bye, Lana.
- Bye.

79
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,048
- Isn't he wonderful?
- Yeah. He's great.

80
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,523
- Hi.
- Hey.

81
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,682
- Hi, Chloe.
- Hi.

82
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,454
Oh, how did the sleepover go?
Did you two get a lot of studying done?

83
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,422
I have to be completely honest
with you, Nell.

84
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:34,705
We didn't study.
We had a Keanu DVD-a-thon.

85
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:39,976
Once you get lost in those brown eyes,
geometry loses its appeal.

86
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,714
Well, I'm just glad you two had fun.

87
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,747
Don't let the grades suffer.

88
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,751
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

89
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,724
Thank you so much, Chloe.

90
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,621
Sure. If you'd given me a heads-up...

91
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:58,286
...I could've come up with something
a lot better than a Keanu DVD-a-thon.

92
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:02,901
Sorry, I had to get out of the house, so
I told Nell I was staying at a friend's place.

93
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,401
You were the first person
that came to mind.

94
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,265
- Really?
- Really.

95
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,600
So where were you last night?

96
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,903
Is there a new guy in Lana Lang's life?

97
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,875
Yeah. His name's Dean.
You passed him on the way in.

98
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,511
- You're dating an older man?
- Relax.

99
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:23,917
He's Nell's boyfriend. He's an insurance
adjuster she met after the tornado.

100
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,753
He's always around, and they're in this
lovey-dovey daze all the time.

101
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:31,191
Yeah, and you want to tell them
to get a room, but it's her house.

102
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,993
After I caught them slow dancing,
I decided to stay at the Talon.

103
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,603
Next time you need to clear out of the
love shack, you don't have to lie.

104
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,864
You can stay at my house for real, anytime.

105
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,302
Thanks.

106
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,983
- This thing weighs a ton.
- I know.

107
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,283
- I'm gonna go call Chloe.
- Wait, wait, don't.

108
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:03,554
Why not? To her, this thing's
like the Holy Grail.

109
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,195
- She'll write an article.
- That's the point. We'll be famous.

110
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,891
We'll write a book,
go on all sorts of talk shows...

111
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,002
...and then we'll sign a big movie deal.

112
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,968
Don't you think we should keep this
between us till we know more?

113
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,474
Why are you gun-shy? We gotta
move before the driver tells someone else.

114
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:22,910
Suppose we tell Chloe and it turns out to be
some high-tech crop-duster or something.

115
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,810
She'll never let us live it down.

116
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:29,011
Exactly. We'd be the subject of her next
"Eat Crow" column for sure.

117
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,447
I don't know about you,
but I'm not willing to risk it.

118
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,320
Well, how do you think you open it?

119
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,557
I'm not sure. Here.

120
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:42,028
You work on that. I'm gonna go see if
anyone's put up "missing spaceship" flyers.

121
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,965
- I'll meet you back here tomorrow morning.
- All right, cool.

122
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:48,935
So where is it now?

123
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,576
- In Pete's tool shed.
- He hasn't told anyone about it?

124
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,178
I convinced him to hold off
the press conference.

125
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,746
Very funny.
We're just gonna have to get it back.

126
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,146
What are we gonna do, Dad, just steal it?

127
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,447
- What if he asks me where it went?
- You'll have to play dumb.

128
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:06,386
- I'm sick of lying.
- You don't have much of a choice here.

129
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,527
- Well, I can tell Pete the truth.
- Clark.

130
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,025
He's not gonna tell anyone.

131
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,427
Look, people slip sometimes,
even the most trustworthy of friends.

132
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,590
This information is too dangerous for Pete.

133
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,362
We understand that this secret
is a huge burden...

134
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,266
...but if you share it with Pete...

135
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:24,205
...you might be giving him
a responsibility he's not ready to take on.

136
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:32,243
I know this isn't the type of bizarre cellular
mutation I normally call you with...

137
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,181
...but I knew you'd be interested.
- What's the room number?

138
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:39,346
You know, the interest
on my med-school loans is killing me.

139
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,996
- You really should have that looked at.
- What's the number?

140
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,504
Who are you?

141
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,411
Dr. Hamilton. How do you feel?

142
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,642
Like my head got bashed in by a bulldozer.

143
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:12,115
Dr. Glenn tells me you saw a spacecraft
in a cornfield last night?

144
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,789
Must have been babbling.

145
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,595
They got me pumped full of morphine.

146
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,697
Who else did you babble to?

147
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,168
- What's it to you?
- Let's say I have a professional interest.

148
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:29,035
I went to the field, I saw the impression in
the cornstalks. Whatever made it is gone.

149
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,036
Damn.

150
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,910
I knew I should have kept my mouth shut.

151
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:40,281
- Someone must have taken it.
- You did see a ship last night?

152
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,219
Who else knows about it?

153
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,950
No one.

154
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,426
Oh, the kid, the one who
pulled me out of my truck.

155
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,068
Pete Ross.

156
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,534
- Have we met before?
- I don't think so.

157
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,570
You were out on the road last night.

158
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,575
You're the crazy son of a bitch
who forced me off the road.

159
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,081
Nurse!

160
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,457
What are you doing?

161
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,197
Nurse!

162
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,944
I don't believe it.

163
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,617
Someone must have gotten here before us.

164
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,187
Well, we're not gonna find out
who it was tonight.

165
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,576
Pete.

166
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,718
- Hey, I was just gonna come talk to you.
- Really?

167
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:22,715
About the ship...

168
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,053
Someone broke into my shed
last night and stole it.

169
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,585
- Really?
- Yeah.

170
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,259
Did you tell anyone it was there?

171
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,398
No. Did you?

172
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,802
- No, my lips have been sealed.
- You're such a liar.

173
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,464
- What do you mean?
- I saw you and your dad driving away.

174
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:48,441
I kept telling myself, there's gotta be some
explanation. Clark Kent would never do this.

175
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,681
Pete, I swear, we didn't take the ship.

176
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,683
And all these years,
I used to think you were my best friend.

177
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,149
Pete, wait. You don't understand.

178
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,019
What don't I understand?
Go ahead, explain it to me, Clark.

179
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,526
That's good, really illuminating.

180
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,425
Wait till Chloe hears about this.

181
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,566
I can already see the headlines:
"The Real Clark Kent Exposed."

182
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,196
Pete, we need to talk.

183
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:49,539
So you're some sort of...?
What, you're not a human?

184
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,738
I don't know what I am.

185
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,437
I don't know where that ship brought
me from. I grew up in Smallville...

186
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,445
...and everything and everyone
that I care about is here.

187
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,744
If you care about me,
how come you never told me?

188
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,787
Believe me, I've always wanted to tell you.
My parents thought it was too dangerous.

189
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,757
- Not just for me, but for anyone who knew.
- You didn't think I could handle it?

190
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,159
Can you?

191
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,431
Another reason I didn't say anything...

192
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,734
...is because I knew people would
look at me the way you're looking at me.

193
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,774
- Yeah, how's that?
- Like a freak.

194
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,481
Pete, I've tried my whole life
just to blend in.

195
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,382
I've tried to be more normal
than anyone else.

196
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,882
Look, just say something.

197
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:43,188
Call me... Call me an alien, call me
a monster. I don't care, just say something.

198
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,164
It's like I don't even know you.

199
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,737
Yes, you do. I'm the same kid
who used to camp in your backyard.

200
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:57,899
We used to ride bikes, play basketball
with your brothers. Nothing has changed.

201
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,407
- Yeah, right.
- Pete.

202
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,877
Back off, man.

203
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,787
Pete, I would never hurt you.

204
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,290
Too late.

205
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,439
There it is. Right there.

206
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,519
Listen, I thought I made it clear
that our business together was over.

207
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:46,954
I've come for my severance package. The
octagonal disk that I found in the field, Lex.

208
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,686
- Why?
- What does it matter to you?

209
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,194
I don't have it.
It disappeared during the storm.

210
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:55,128
Liar! It's a key! I know you have it!

211
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,760
This isn't over.

212
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,782
- Mr. Luthor?
- Yes.

213
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,477
I'm Dr. Steven Hamilton.

214
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,816
I've been doing
confidential research on the...

215
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,753
...meteor rocks for your son
at Cadmus Labs.

216
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,986
All right, you've got my attention.

217
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,961
Well, unfortunately, Lex has become...

218
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:31,302
...shortsighted and impatient.
We've severed our relationship. But you...

219
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,802
You have a reputation as a...

220
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,738
- A man of vision.
- Apparently, doctor...

221
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,740
...you haven't noticed that I'm blind.

222
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,272
A man like you doesn't have to have eyes
to see the future...

223
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,005
...or to recognize a opportunity.

224
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,311
- Don't flatter me. Get to the point.
- I discovered something that...

225
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:52,048
...can only be described as earth-shattering,
and I'd like to show it to you.

226
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,626
Come on.

227
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,491
Hey, Pete.

228
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,170
Look, I know you freaked out.

229
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,431
Don't you think
I freak myself out sometimes?

230
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,203
All right, look, you have every reason
in the world to hate me...

231
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,438
...but I need to find that ship.

232
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:23,476
The guy you pulled out of the truck
must've told someone. I thought maybe...

233
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:28,149
The other day, when we were moving the
ship, you said it was heavy. You were lying.

234
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,119
You'd miss the bus and end up
at school ahead of me.

235
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,161
You said you got a ride,
but you never got rides, did you?

236
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,131
Our whole life, you were the person
I could tell anything...

237
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:42,069
...and I did, all my secrets. But you,
everything you ever told me was a lie!

238
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,367
Maybe I was right in not telling you,
the way you're reacting.

239
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:49,074
Clark, you don't get it, do you?
I don't care if you're from the moon.

240
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,716
You never trusted me.
What kind of friendship is that?

241
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:55,751
Hey, guys. Why didn't you tell me
about the superhero deal?

242
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,389
Pete pulls a guy from a mangled truck
and rushes him to the hospital?

243
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,695
That's got Torch exclusive
written all over it.

244
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,063
So how about an interview?

245
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,633
Maybe later.

246
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,498
Your reluctance wouldn't be part of
a vast conspiracy...

247
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,539
...designed to cover up a whole
spaceship thing, would it?

248
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,142
- What?
- My source from the medical center called.

249
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:24,442
He said the guy was rambling on about
some spacecraft that landed in a cornfield.

250
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,481
You don't really believe that, do you?

251
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,644
I don't know, not unless
Pete can corroborate the story.

252
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,381
Sure, Chloe, I saw a spaceship.

253
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,690
- I even met an alien.
- Really?

254
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:40,155
- Would you like to describe it?
- Actually, he looks a lot like Clark.

255
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,463
I thought aliens were little and green.

256
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:51,140
I guess things aren't always
what you think they are.

257
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,071
Okay, what's up with him?

258
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,410
It's just guy stuff.

259
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,684
You're not really looking into this story,
are you? It sounds like Inquisitor stuff.

260
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:05,118
Maybe, but if there is some truth to it,
that's front-page news...

261
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,951
...for the Daily Planet.

262
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,278
- Lex?
- Your mom said it would be okay if I waited.

263
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,743
Yeah, what's up?

264
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,749
I just needed to get out of the mansion.
It's getting crowded.

265
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:38,788
- Doesn't it have, like, 75 rooms?
- Well, my father takes up a lot of space.

266
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,323
When's he going back to Metropolis?

267
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,261
Not soon enough.

268
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,858
Is he really being that difficult?

269
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,663
Just the opposite.
He's the picture of civility.

270
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,272
Says he wants to work on our relationship.

271
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,305
Is that such a bad thing?

272
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:03,110
He's lied to me so many times, it's hard to
believe he doesn't have an ulterior motive.

273
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,849
- Maybe give him the benefit of the doubt.
- No, no.

274
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:10,215
If a person's deceived me, I find it hard
to give him a second chance.

275
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:16,994
By the way, you remember that paperweight
I had on my desk, the octagonal one?

276
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,289
Kind of, why?

277
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,899
Came up today,
made me wonder what happened to it.

278
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,893
- When did you lose it?
- During the storm.

279
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:31,505
Probably got carried away with all the
other debris from the mansion. You know?

280
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,346
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.

281
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,445
Good luck.

282
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,990
Forgive my skepticism, doctor,
but for all I can tell, this could be...

283
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,528
...a postmodern coffee table.

284
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,134
Why should I believe you
that it's a spacecraft?

285
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:59,862
The alloy you're touching is composed
of elements not on the periodic table.

286
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:03,165
Certain chemicals in that alloy
are present in the meteor rocks.

287
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,670
Get me the proof.

288
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,177
Here.

289
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,413
- Feel this?
- Yeah.

290
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:10,878
There's a piece missing.

291
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:15,247
Lex and I were investigating a meteor site,
and I found an octagonal-shaped disk...

292
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,685
...that is the exact size and shape
of that impression.

293
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,257
- And you think it was...?
- It was a key...

294
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,554
...that opens the ship and will provide
the proof you're asking for.

295
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,425
Unfortunately, Lex won't give it back to me.

296
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,932
- Maybe Lex doesn't have the disk anymore.
- Where else would it be?

297
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,367
If you can answer that question, doctor...

298
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,900
...you just might get your funding.

299
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,087
Lana?

300
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,856
What are you doing?

301
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:01,658
Just using your telescope to see
if it's safe to go home.

302
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,157
Hiding from Nell.

303
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,235
Her new boyfriend, Dean.

304
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,130
Oh, you're not crazy about him.

305
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:14,906
Oh, long story short, not really. But I'm a
terrible liar, so I've moved on to avoidance.

306
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,676
Well, you've come to the right place.

307
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,952
What's wrong?

308
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,823
Have you ever had anyone resent you
for telling them the truth?

309
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,226
Yeah.

310
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,666
Whitney, when I told him how I felt
and we broke up.

311
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:46,342
Wow, you really did it. I didn't think
you'd follow through on that.

312
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,308
So do you think you'll ever be friends again?

313
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:54,918
Someday.

314
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:58,578
I hope. I just wish I'd been honest
with him sooner.

315
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:04,651
Yeah, Pete and I, we had a big blowout.
I don't know if our friendship is gonna last.

316
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,955
What did you guys fight about?

317
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,696
I wish I could tell you.

318
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,701
Typical.

319
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,269
What?

320
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,408
Clark Kent starts a discussion...

321
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,508
...about telling the truth, no less...

322
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:25,173
...and when it's his turn to open up,
everything is suddenly a deep, dark secret.

323
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,816
Well, the stuff about Pete
is kind of personal.

324
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,088
Unlike what I just told you about Whitney.

325
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:37,722
Have you ever thought that some people are
more comfortable opening up than others?

326
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,729
I don't think it's ever comfortable
for anyone.

327
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,666
But if you care about somebody,
you owe it to them.

328
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,735
Then you should talk to Nell,
tell her how you really feel.

329
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,376
You're right, Clark.

330
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,806
Hiding the truth only keeps people apart.

331
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,443
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

332
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,446
- There's a piece missing.
- You stole the spaceship?

333
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:35,643
It's octagonal in shape, the size of my palm.
Tell me where it is!

334
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,254
I know you. You're Dr. Hamilton.

335
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,358
You don't know
who you're messing with!

336
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:44,552
That spaceship belongs
to someone a lot tougher than you...

337
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:49,328
- You know who it belongs to.
- Look, I don't know anything.

338
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,900
Tell me. Tell me who it is!

339
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:09,449
I checked the papers, the police wires and
UFO sites. There's no mention of the ship.

340
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,885
I don't know if that makes me
relieved or worried.

341
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:15,959
I was thinking about Ray Wallace.
If Pete visited him before he died, maybe...

342
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,322
Maybe he told Pete something
that could help us.

343
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:19,929
I assume it's a possibility.

344
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,632
Clark, I want you to talk
to Pete one more time.

345
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,796
I can't.

346
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,763
Why?

347
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,208
Pete's not speaking to me.

348
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,838
What happened?

349
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:40,007
Look, I don't want you guys
to freak out, all right?

350
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,978
But I told Pete.

351
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,413
Everything.

352
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,352
- I didn't have a choice. He saw us...
- What do you mean?

353
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,657
- You could have come to us first.
- And come up with another lie?

354
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:58,826
Clark, at least tell us
Pete's not gonna tell anybody else.

355
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,301
I'm not sure what he's gonna do.
He's upset.

356
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:09,274
Hello.

357
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:10,978
No, he's not here.

358
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:15,280
Oh, no.
Okay, whatever we can do. Bye-bye.

359
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,783
That was Pete's mother.
He's missing.

360
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,470
This is a wonderful idea, Lana.

361
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:38,001
I realize we haven't had much time alone
since I started seeing Dean.

362
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,606
Actually, that's kind of what I wanted
to talk to you about.

363
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,176
- Dean's a really, really great guy. It's just...
- Let me guess.

364
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:50,347
You liked the tables the way they were.

365
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,548
Am I that transparent?

366
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:58,056
Well, I've already had a long talk with Dean,
and I told him you're very independent...

367
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:01,289
...and before he goes offering
any more unsolicited advice...

368
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,833
...he should...
Well, he should get to know you better.

369
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,369
Thanks, Nell, I really appreciate that.

370
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,930
Lana, your feelings
are very important to me...

371
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,709
...and they're important to Dean too.

372
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,710
That's why we'd both like
to spend more time together.

373
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,872
The three of us, as a family.

374
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,551
Family.

375
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:27,057
Lana, Dean didn't want me to say anything
until we were all together...

376
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:30,156
...but, well, you know me,
I can never keep a secret.

377
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,995
Lana, Dean's asked me to marry him.

378
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,626
- What did you say?
- I said yes.

379
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,639
The spaceship, I need to know!

380
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,173
Are you gonna tell me...

381
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,047
...who this belongs to?

382
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:59,887
Look, man, I was just fronting.
I was trying to scare you.

383
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,686
- I have no clue whose ship that is.
- You're lying!

384
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,356
Look, you're sick.

385
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,661
Just let me go!
I'll bring back help.

386
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,360
Sure. You think anyone's gonna help me?

387
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,233
The doctors don't even have a name
for what's killing me!

388
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,170
- You're dying?
- Yes.

389
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,435
But not before I prove I am not some...

390
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:24,343
...sideshow freak, a quack doctor who sells
meteor rocks on the side of the road.

391
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:28,383
And if you don't tell me what I want
to know, then you're dying too!

392
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:36,917
Hamilton reports finding large
concentrations of meteor fragments...

393
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:41,555
...spread over a large area
south of County Highway 17.

394
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,167
These fragments vary in circumference...

395
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:49,102
...from 24 microns five to 500
and 62 millimeters.

396
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,003
Interesting reading, Dad.

397
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:55,809
Lex.
I didn't hear you come in.

398
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,873
I'm surprised.

399
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:02,410
Dr. Rawlings says he's seen improvement in
your other senses since you lost your sight.

400
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,020
You spoke to Rawlings?

401
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:08,288
Imagine my surprise when he told me how
worried he was that you'd gone AWOL...

402
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:11,360
...and missed your last several
physical-therapy sessions.

403
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,563
In fact, he says the worst thing
for you right now...

404
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,326
...is to be away from your care providers.

405
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:24,302
Do you have any idea how degrading it is
to be poked and prodded by therapists?

406
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,943
How demeaning it is to be told...

407
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:31,946
...by a Braille instructor, "One day, one day,
all this will feel natural"?

408
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,709
You want the truth, Lex?

409
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:42,386
I was tired of being treated like an object,
an invalid. I had to get away from that.

410
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,957
You thought a couple days of oedipal
mano a mano would make you feel better?

411
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:57,267
Your analogy's apt but flawed, Lex.
Blind Oedipus was the son, not the father.

412
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,344
I'll go back to Metropolis.

413
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:06,947
So your sudden interest in Dr. Hamilton
was really just a coincidence?

414
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,183
I admit, I find his work...

415
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,515
...intriguing.
- He's sick, possibly delusional.

416
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:15,716
Never underestimate the value
of eccentrics and lunatics, Lex.

417
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:18,020
Every Arthur needs his Merlin.

418
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,194
Hamilton said that he found
some sort of...

419
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,825
...disk and that you had it.

420
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,470
- He's mistaken.
- Oh, even so...

421
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:31,335
...I think it may have been a bit rash
to terminate his contract.

422
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,235
Why do you say that?

423
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:38,940
Have you taken a look
in the good doctor's barn lately?

424
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,247
Hey, Chloe, have you seen Pete?

425
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,950
No, but the weird-o-meter
just kicked up another notch.

426
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,618
Hospital visitor log.

427
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,423
Yeah, I was looking into
Ray Wallace's death.

428
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:58,658
It turns out he had a visitor just before
he flatlined. A Dr. Steven Hamilton.

429
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:00,269
- The meteor freak?
- Yeah.

430
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,029
- I thought he left.
- So did I.

431
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,369
So Pete plays good samaritan,
Dr. Hamilton visits the patient...

432
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,306
Patient dies and Pete disappears.

433
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,446
It's not exactly smoking gun, but...

434
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,741
It's good enough.
I'm gonna check out Hamilton.

435
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:16,683
He used to have a place down on
Allentown Road, maybe he's back there.

436
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,317
Clark?

437
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,515
Clark?

438
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,289
Clark?

439
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:36,304
- What are you doing?
- See how my hand spasms?

440
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,999
It's from prolonged exposure
to the meteor rocks.

441
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,800
I'm gonna give you...

442
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:44,641
...a dosage that's gonna make my tremors
look like a mild twitch.

443
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:46,477
I told you I didn't know anything!

444
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,451
I think you're lying.
You're protecting someone.

445
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,612
- I hope whoever it is, is worth dying for!
- All right!

446
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,456
You want me to talk,
here's what I have to say.

447
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,790
Take that needle and stick it wherever,
because I'm not telling you a damn thing!

448
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:23,814
Pete!

449
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:27,218
- Put the needle down!
- Not till he tells me what he knows.

450
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,439
Clark.

451
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,610
- What's wrong?
- I'm allergic to the meteor rocks.

452
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,684
This ship is yours, isn't it?

453
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:06,455
Open it!
Open it!

454
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,496
Open it!

455
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,178
Clark, come on!

456
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,319
We gotta get you out of here.

457
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,226
We have to help him!

458
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:55,839
It's too late, he's dead. Come on.

459
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,574
We gotta get the ship.

460
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,225
So does it do anything?

461
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,991
We hoped we might
find some answers inside about Clark...

462
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,964
...but we haven't been able to open it.

463
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:22,002
Clark, look.

464
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,373
I know I sort of went postal
when all this started...

465
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,612
...but after what happened to Hamilton...

466
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,806
...I realized why you never told me...

467
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,415
...and I'm sorry.

468
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:41,717
Well, I guess you had a good reason
to be upset.

469
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:43,826
We're just glad you weren't hurt.

470
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,356
There's still one thing.

471
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,562
Hamilton tried to kill me, and...

472
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:51,164
...he could have told the whole world
about you...

473
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,269
...but you still tried to save him.

474
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:57,663
I couldn't let you die to protect my secret,
and I can't let anyone else die either.

475
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,537
No matter who they are.

476
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,311
Man...

477
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:06,407
...it's not easy being you, is it?

478
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:10,416
Well, good thing is, I got my best friend
to watch my back.

479
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,245
Pete...

480
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,122
...I'm proud of you.

481
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:20,995
But I hope you realize what a tremendous
responsibility knowing this secret is.

482
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,868
And believe me,
it's not gonna get any easier.

483
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:29,834
That's my dad's way of saying,
"Welcome to the family."

484
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:51,325
Does it look anything like
Hamilton's description?

485
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:52,926
What he says it was?

486
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,764
There's nothing here, Dad.

487
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,633
They must have moved it.

488
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:07,741
Or someone took it.

489
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:11,746
- Come on. The helicopter's waiting.
- No, I'm not going back, not just yet.

490
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:15,215
- What about your treatment?
- I'm afraid those physical therapists...

491
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,149
...will just have to come to me.

492
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:21,018
I hope you're not staying because of
a sudden interest in alien spacecraft.

493
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,454
Of course not.

494
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:27,290
I'm staying because I want to spend
more quality time with my only son.

495
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:30,361
Good, because this could all be a hoax.

496
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,470
Hoax or not, I'm not the only one
who's suddenly interested in it.

497
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,940
So this super-speed thing, how fast
we talking? Twenty, 30 miles per hour?

498
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:43,978
Yeah, something like that.

499
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:50,446
What about the x-ray? Have you
used it to look through a girl's...?

500
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:54,079
It only works when I focus, and I do not
use it to invade people's privacy.

501
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,326
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

502
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,752
So you're telling me, never once
have you looked in the girls' locker room?

503
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,622
Well...

504
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,193
...maybe once.
- That's my boy.

505
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,100
So you been holding back
on the court?

506
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:10,535
A little bit.

507
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,740
So, what are we waiting for?
Show me what you got.

508
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,313
- I don't think you want to go there, Pete.
- Bring it on.

509
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:22,251
- All right.
- Now, we all know...

510
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,321
...if I guard you,
you're not getting near this hoop.

511
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,550
I don't care what kind
of powers you got, let's go.

512
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:49,041
This is gonna be fun.

513
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
