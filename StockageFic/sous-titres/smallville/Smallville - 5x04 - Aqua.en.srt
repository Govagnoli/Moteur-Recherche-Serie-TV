1
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,308
- I think you missed a spot.
- Where?

2
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,550
- Well, I know what you did this summer.
- Lois?

3
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,549
Don't look so guilty, Smallville. About
time you lovebirds flapped your wings.

4
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,156
- What are you doing back?
- Yeah, we thought you were in Europe.

5
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,357
Hoping.

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,830
- Are you gonna stay with Chloe?
- I just ran into Mrs. Kent at the Talon.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,037
Out of nowhere, she asked
if I'd like to move back in at the farm.

8
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,315
Yeah, right.

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,313
- Really?
- I know, isn't that sweet?

10
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,234
Oh, don't worry, you little snuggle
bunnies can hop around all you want.

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,118
I'm a heavy sleeper.

12
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,794
I'm going for a dip.

13
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,032
Think she could sleep through me
smothering her with a pillow?

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,678
Don't you stay in the sun too long
or you're gonna get fried.

15
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,552
I take it Lana hasn't gotten a <i>peek...</i>

16
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,553
...into the confidential files
of Clark Kent yet.

17
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,199
Chloe, you think I'm <i>happy...</i>

18
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,794
...about having my powers back
and lying about them?

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,916
I didn't ask for this life.

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,750
We didn't ask for a world
that needs heroes...

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,433
...but the truth is, we do.

22
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,795
Now more than ever, Clark.

23
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,033
Something's wrong.

24
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,668
She's been under way too long.

25
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,679
Go.

26
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,674
Is she all right?

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,797
I'm working on it.

28
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,794
Hey.

29
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,596
You ought to stick to the shallow end
till you learn to swim, gorgeous.

30
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,877
Maybe you ought to try
a breath mint, surfer boy.

31
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,440
Name's Arthur curry.
My friends call me AC.

32
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,514
Come on, we gotta get you
back to the farm.

33
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,391
- Where did Bobby Baywatch come from?
- I don't know.

34
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,158
But he can sure swim fast.

35
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,598
Are we talking Olympic-gold-medal fast,
or meteor-freak fast?

36
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,116
This is something else.
He can swim faster than I can.

37
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,269
Do you know where the greatest
supercomputer in the world resides?

38
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,478
Right here.

39
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,437
It's the human brain.

40
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,955
Yet we only use 10 percent of it.

41
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,159
Good morning, Mr. Kent.

42
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,512
Did we start too early for you?

43
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,833
Sorry, l... I kind of got lost.

44
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,789
If there are any
other wayward travelers...

45
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,794
...this is Introduction to World History,
and I am Professor Milton Fine.

46
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,431
But before we delve into my lectures
about the Greeks, Romans and Spartans...

47
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,068
All of which I'm sure
you'll find very enlightening.

48
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,470
- Let's look at the word "history."

49
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,750
History is not about facts.

50
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,517
It's about the context
and who is telling the story.

51
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,634
So, what is history?

52
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,358
What is her story?

53
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,476
What is your story, Mr. Kent?

54
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,797
How will you affect the world
around you for the generations to come?

55
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,670
I'm not sure you can
know that at 18.

56
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,512
Tell that to Alexander the Great.

57
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,310
Or to bring it closer to home,
Lex Luthor.

58
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,231
Now, he's not much older
than you are...

59
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,709
<i>...and</i> yet he's turned his father's
agrobusiness...

60
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,155
...into a leading defense contractor.

61
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,790
He's gone from feeding people
to killing them.

62
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,396
And yet his "story"
is that he's a white <i>knight...</i>

63
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,438
...who's just put
a small Kansas town on the map.

64
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,032
Beware white knights, people.

65
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,920
They don't slay <i>dragons...</i>

66
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,993
...they train them
to suit their own dark purpose.

67
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,870
Think of Hitler, Stalin, Napoleon.

68
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,599
Lex is not a saint...

69
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,950
<i>...but</i> I don't think you can put him
in the same league as those guys.

70
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,910
An honest opinion.

71
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,518
I like that.

72
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,470
I think it's full.

73
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,638
Customers like it that way.
More bang for their buck.

74
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,119
I got a buck.

75
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,349
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

76
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,988
You should use it
to get some fashion sense.

77
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,553
- Hey, here you go.
- Thanks.

78
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,594
You know, this whole orange
and green thing you got going?

79
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,034
Yeah.

80
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,509
It looks like Flipper threw up.

81
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,556
I'll tell you what.

82
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,234
You show me how to dress
the way you like...

83
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,914
<i>...and</i> I'll teach you how to swim.

84
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,193
I know how to swim, thank you.

85
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,798
You're welcome.

86
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,479
But next time, I might not be there to
suck the water out of those pretty lungs.

87
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,670
Look, I didn't need you to play
paramedic, fish stick, all right?

88
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,430
I just had a little bit of water
down the wrong pipe.

89
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,879
- You were turning blue.
- It's a good color on me.

90
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,550
Look, it was a freak accident,
all right?

91
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,393
- I practically live in the water.
- Me too.

92
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,195
But I can swim.

93
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,913
So can I.

94
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,197
I'm a great swimmer.
I can swim like a fish.

95
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,634
Prove it.

96
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,270
Professor, I'm sorry to bother you,
but I know I got off on the wrong foot.

97
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,590
- I wanted to apologize.
- Oh, never apologize.

98
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,230
If you're gonna show up late,
at least do it with conviction, Mr. Kent.

99
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,753
How do you know my name?

100
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,514
What was the first thing you did
the day of orientation?

101
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,079
- I got my picture taken.
- Yeah.

102
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,630
And that photo is in a database, which
I check before the semester begins.

103
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,950
That way I can call my students
by their names.

104
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,111
Helps the learning process.

105
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,714
How long have you been friends
with Lex Luthor?

106
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,309
- Who said we were friends?
- It's just a deduction.

107
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,472
Why else would the son of
family farmers be defending such a man?

108
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,834
It's a long story.

109
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,230
But he's not the man
you make him out to be.

110
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,469
Well, Groucho Marx said there's only
one way to find out if a man is honest.

111
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,713
Ask him. If he says yes,
he must be crooked.

112
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,151
I would think a college professor
would quote Karl Marx, not Groucho.

113
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,788
German philosophy is easy.
Comedy's hard.

114
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,791
Hey, why don't you
come work for me?

115
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,278
I'm interviewing research assistants
for my book on LuthorCorp.

116
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,192
You could find out
the truth about Lex.

117
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,677
Thanks, professor, but I'm not
really looking for a job right now.

118
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,796
You know what's worse than the fear
of speaking the truth, Mr. Kent?

119
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,996
It's the fear of uncovering it.

120
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,799
- You coming or what?
- Of course, I'm waiting on you.

121
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,997
I thought you loved the water.
You're tiring out already on me.

122
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,110
- I'm just enjoying the view.
- Yeah, yeah.

123
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,077
So you ready to race or what?

124
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,276
You don't really think
you're faster than me?

125
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,271
Oh, I know I am.

126
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,714
- Ready?
- All right.

127
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,111
On three. One, two...

128
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,872
Three.

129
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,194
- Hey.
- Hey.

130
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,438
How did you do that?

131
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,990
Don't sweat it. I'm part fish.

132
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,872
Thank you.

133
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,276
I don't know, that was pretty good.
You can seriously shred out there.

134
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,793
Lots of practice.

135
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,428
My swim teacher was a Navy SEAL.

136
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,470
I swim with the seals.

137
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,233
They're awesome.

138
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,597
You're not a military brat, are you?

139
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,518
No.

140
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,717
Just a brat.

141
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,518
What are you doing?

142
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,195
What? Wha...? What's happening?

143
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,157
- What's going on?
- You don't hear that?

144
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,753
Hear what?

145
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,679
AC.

146
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,589
AC.

147
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,234
AC! AC!

148
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,391
Okay, okay.

149
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,999
Just lie back. Lie back.

150
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,074
With the exception of
an unexplained disturbance at the site...

151
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,071
...today's trial was a complete success.

152
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,756
Great. Send me the tapes.

153
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,837
The best part of my job:

154
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,197
Watching impossible dreams
become reality.

155
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,432
- How far was the target?
- Three kilometers away.

156
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,397
Three kilometers?

157
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,790
That's half a kilometer further
than projected.

158
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,348
Yes.

159
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,193
Leviathan is exceeding all expectations
across the board.

160
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,198
If this goes well tomorrow,
my associates from the Pentagon...

161
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,318
...are gonna wanna put Leviathan
on every vessel in the fleet.

162
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,679
What about marine life?

163
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,916
We still haven't figured out
how to protect...

164
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,753
There are plenty of fish
in the sea, doctor.

165
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,309
Nobody's gonna miss
a couple that go belly-up.

166
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,873
Let's get Leviathan back to the lab.

167
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,675
- Hey.
- Thanks.

168
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,434
You know, we should
get you checked out at a hospital.

169
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,114
No, I'm cool.

170
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,552
Is that surfer talk for "there was
blood coming out of my ears"?

171
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,553
Because, you know, on dry land
that usually isn't a good sign.

172
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,632
It's probably just an ear infection
or something.

173
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,358
Can we just drop it?

174
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,472
Sure.

175
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,475
What are you doing?

176
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,354
Seeing if you have a fever.

177
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,675
- You really don't listen, do you?
- No, I try not to. I find it distracting.

178
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,477
Well, what's the verdict, doc?

179
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,918
You're actually a little cold.

180
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,311
Well, that's weird.
I'm feeling kind of warm right now.

181
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,837
Does that line ever work on anyone?

182
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,039
I figured it was
like a one-in-ten shot.

183
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,111
But you're worth the risk.

184
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,953
You don't even know me.

185
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,959
What's to know?

186
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,759
You're abrasive, sarcastic,
you never shut up.

187
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,510
- Yeah, those are my good qualities.
- Oh, I know.

188
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,954
Look, just because you saved me
when I wasn't <i>drowning...</i>

189
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,236
...doesn't give you
the right to slobber on me.

190
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,913
Sorry.

191
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,432
You should be.

192
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,232
Lois.

193
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,072
Hey, Smallville.

194
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,874
Lois is all over this guy.

195
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,077
And all we know about him
is that he can swim faster than I can.

196
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,753
Well, let me look him up.

197
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,309
He's a sophomore
at the University of Miami...

198
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,357
...majoring in marine biology.

199
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,112
Oh, and here's a shocker.

200
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,590
He's on the swim team, leaving
all of his competition in the wake.

201
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,553
Does he have a criminal record?

202
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,273
Yeah.

203
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,079
Last year he broke into
the Ocean Village Resort.

204
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,958
What'd he steal?

205
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,238
Eight dolphins.

206
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,790
He busted open an underwater fence
and released them back into the ocean.

207
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,509
I don't know, clark. It doesn't sound
like FBI's Most Wanted material to me.

208
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,796
Maybe it's the only thing
he's been caught for.

209
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,598
Maybe, but according to all this...

210
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,399
...he has never dipped a fin
in Smallville until now.

211
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,028
Sort of shoots down
our meteor-freak theory.

212
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,953
Not the first guy who didn't
get his abilities from meteors.

213
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,473
Really?

214
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,236
There was this kid last year,
kind of ran too fast for his own good.

215
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,593
Well, so far the only thing
we have on Arthur Curry...

216
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,309
...is that he saved Lois
from being permanently waterlogged.

217
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,155
Are you sure you're not just upset that
someone was stealing your hero thunder?

218
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,480
I don't know what it is about this <i>guy...</i>

219
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,351
...but I got a bad feeling.

220
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,316
You should've seen this guy,
it was amazing.

221
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,232
I've never seen anybody swim so fast.

222
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,391
Or drink so much water.

223
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,835
It keeps my skin soft.

224
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,675
So how do you like
the University of Miami?

225
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,755
- You go to school in Miami?
- Yeah.

226
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,878
- How do you know that?
- I'm a big fan of college swimming.

227
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,878
Really? Since when?

228
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,759
Since Arthur Curry
started dominating the sport.

229
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,315
So how'd you learn to swim so fast?

230
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,628
I don't know.
I guess it runs in the family.

231
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,957
My dad operates
a lighthouse down South.

232
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,678
Swims like a lead weight.

233
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,033
So it must have been my mom
with the skills...

234
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,918
...but she died when I was a baby.

235
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,354
Ac, I'm so sorry.

236
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,360
I'm not gonna say it doesn't <i>suck...</i>

237
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,988
...but, you know, growing up
by the water was awesome.

238
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,200
I probably spent
more time in it than out.

239
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,793
And what brings you
to the most landlocked spot on the map?

240
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,678
Crater Lake.

241
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,389
Last few months,
a bunch of fish have been dying off.

242
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,915
The EPA blames it
on temperature change...

243
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,957
<i>...but</i> I think that's totally bogus.

244
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,998
Smallville's a long way to go
to check on temperature changes.

245
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,311
Not if you care
about the world you live in.

246
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,710
People think what happens
in oceans and lakes...

247
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,757
...doesn't affect their lives.

248
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,309
It does. It's all connected.

249
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,829
You really believe that,
or is that a pick-up line?

250
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,274
Clark.

251
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,672
Smallville, can I talk to you
over here for a minute?

252
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,873
There's a cinnamon bun
I need your opinion on.

253
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,713
What are you doing?
I already have an overprotective dad.

254
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,395
I don't need an overprotective brother,
especially one who isn't my brother.

255
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,949
Am I the only one who thinks
there's something fishy?

256
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,473
Yes. Now quit being a jerk.

257
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,552
- I'm sorry about that.
- No, it's cool.

258
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,158
I gotta bounce.

259
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,070
Do you want some company?

260
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,310
No, I have a few things
I need to take care of...

261
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,959
<i>...so</i> I'll just swing by later.

262
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,834
You know, you're <i>right...</i>

263
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,639
...I was being a jerk.
I'm gonna go apologize.

264
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,759
I don't know how
you put up with him, Lana.

265
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,231
Thanks for dropping the A-bomb
on my date.

266
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,153
- Did you apologize to AC?
- I didn't get a chance to.

267
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,118
- Why not?
- He was too busy playing terrorist.

268
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,269
What?

269
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,671
Lois, I saw him trying to blow up
some sort of lab.

270
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,637
You really don't like him, do you?

271
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,552
This has nothing to do
with how I feel.

272
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,473
No? Attacking AC, making up stories.

273
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,474
You know, if I didn't know any better,
I'd think somebody was jealous.

274
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,030
Is she great or what?

275
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,035
- Arthur.
- Call me AC.

276
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,509
Man, I thought I had the hook up,
but the way you flak-jacketed that C4...

277
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,556
...that was awesome, bro.
- I was just trying to stop a bomb, bro.

278
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,439
Yeah. Nice work.

279
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,276
Thanks to you, the oceans are one step
closer to becoming a graveyard.

280
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,671
That thing you tried to blow up had
something to do with the dead fish?

281
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,149
No, not something. Everything.

282
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,278
It's a sonar weapon called Leviathan.

283
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,919
It emits a focused sound wave...

284
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,514
...that packs enough punch
to rip a submarine in half.

285
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,997
- How do you know that?
- I peeked at some documents at the lab.

286
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,633
They had "Luthorcorp"
stamped all over them.

287
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,834
You mean Lex is trying
to develop some sort of weapon.

288
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,798
One that also happens to kill
any sea life around it.

289
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,190
Even when it's on stand by.

290
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,434
In four hours, he's demoing Leviathan
for the Pentagon.

291
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,795
If they bite and start dropping these
things in the water, it'll be a disaster.

292
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,634
We have to stop him.

293
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,509
- I'll go talk to Lex.
- There isn't enough time.

294
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,272
With you on the turf and me in the surf,
we could stop this thing.

295
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,431
By blowing up his lab?

296
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,672
Well, I'm not gonna sit back
and let this happen, Clark.

297
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,432
I was born with an amazing gift...

298
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,989
...and I plan to use it
to help protect this planet.

299
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,028
I'm not gonna let you
put innocent lives at risk.

300
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,633
Like your buddy Lex Luthor?

301
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,439
He's not my buddy. Not anymore.

302
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,797
- I think we can get him to...
- You think he doesn't know what it does?

303
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,313
He doesn't care.

304
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,995
You wanna work together, then we go
clear this up with Lex. That's the deal.

305
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,799
All right. We'll try it
your way, boy scout.

306
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,076
Let's have words with the cue ball.

307
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,439
- Clark, you got here fast.
- Thanks for seeing us, Lex.

308
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,109
Well, I only have a few minutes.
I'm on my way out.

309
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,077
Yeah, we know, bro.

310
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,633
Now, I don't believe
we've had the pleasure.

311
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,555
Lex, this is my friend
from out of town, Arthur Curry.

312
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,597
You have to stop it.

313
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,478
Stop what?

314
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,473
We know about the weapon
you're testing, Lex.

315
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,996
I guess the billions you make
from agriculture isn't enough.

316
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,958
One day of college
and he's already an activist.

317
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,510
Clark, the only weapon I'm developing
is the kind that fights hunger.

318
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,513
My team's been working
on a fast-growing, high-protein kelp...

319
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,911
Leviathan has nothing to do
with feeding the hungry, Luthor.

320
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,389
It's a weapon that'll kill
everything in the water.

321
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,516
I'm sorry, who are you again?

322
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,796
Someone that cares about
the world he lives in.

323
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,838
Shut Leviathan down. There's other
ways to defend this country.

324
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,117
The days of you barging into my home
to give me sage advice are over.

325
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,756
Lex, whatever our differences,
I don't want to see you get hurt.

326
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,636
There are people out there
who will stop you.

327
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,439
If you think I'll bow down
to the tactics of extremists...

328
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,352
<i>...you</i> really don't know me very well.

329
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,915
I told you this was a waste of time.

330
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,998
Arthur.

331
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,431
You know, you're a real tool, Lex.
I hope you get what you deserve.

332
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,355
I'm out of here. I got things to do.

333
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,680
Your new friend's got
a bit of an anger problem.

334
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,398
He gets that way when someone
tries to destroy what he loves.

335
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,796
Clark, I'm not trying
to destroy anything.

336
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,070
Lex, don't bother trying to cover it up.

337
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,231
The days of me believing
your lies are over.

338
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,156
Why are you doing this to me?

339
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,437
One, you called me a tool.

340
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,274
And two, most people I know need
scuba gear to breathe underwater.

341
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,588
I'm just good at holding my breath.

342
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,712
I shouldn't be surprised
there's something unusual about you.

343
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,952
I mean, you are a friend
of clark Kent's.

344
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,914
He doesn't know anything about this.

345
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,228
How about some water?

346
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,835
- I'm running a little thirsty.
- So am I.

347
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,993
I have a thirst for knowledge.
One that never seems to get quenched.

348
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,953
What group are you with?
Guardians of the Sea?

349
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,796
I don't travel with an entourage.

350
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,028
Please...

351
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,918
...I need some water.

352
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,713
Now, I usually don't deny
my guests a drink...

353
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,553
...but something tells me
if I give you water...

354
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,868
...you'll bust out of those restraints
before the glass is empty.

355
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,431
Now, let's try again.

356
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,955
How are you able
to breathe underwater?

357
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,475
Shut down Leviathan, and I'll tell you
everything you want to know.

358
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,195
<i>Mr. Luthor, Leviathan is submerged.</i>
<i>The clients are in the viewing room.</i>

359
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,033
<i>All systems are ready to go.</i>

360
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,398
Well, I guess we'll have
to pick this up later.

361
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,072
Please. Please. Please.

362
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,589
I don't care what you do to me.

363
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,754
Please destroy that weapon.

364
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,595
Okay, you convinced me.

365
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,194
I'll flush $ 100 million
in R & D down the toilet...

366
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,794
<i>...and</i> put the nation's fleet at risk
while I'm at it.

367
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,031
You might be a big fish in the water,
but up here, I'm the shark.

368
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,637
No.

369
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,877
Water.

370
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,549
I knew I'd find you here.
Are you okay?

371
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,795
Wet and ready, bro.

372
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,115
The test is going down.
The security's everywhere.

373
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,876
- I'll never make it through in time.
- You might be able to with a little help.

374
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,751
Gentlemen, I stand before you
humbled by a technology...

375
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,196
...that will forever tip the balance
of naval power in our favor.

376
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,874
That's a bold claim.

377
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,270
You'll see with your own eyes.

378
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,874
Let the show begin.

379
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,837
Activating ranging system.

380
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,958
Modulator engaged.

381
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,877
What the hell was that?

382
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,518
What's going on?

383
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,354
Looks to me like Mr. Luthor's
miracle weapon just self-destructed.

384
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,353
Admiral. Admiral, please.

385
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,833
Yes, admiral, I understand.

386
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,478
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.

387
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,072
Clark, I thought
the next time I saw you...

388
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,915
...you'd be waving a banner
at some protest rally outside LuthorCorp.

389
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,437
I was thinking I'd write a paper on that
high-protein kelp you were working on.

390
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,272
There any new developments?

391
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,068
Well, it's funny you should ask.

392
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,153
The project was derailed
by a couple of misguided vandals.

393
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,118
The equipment's damaged
beyond repair.

394
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,471
Maybe it wasn't meant to be.

395
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,436
Maybe.

396
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,233
Say, how's your friend?

397
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,431
Arthur? I don't know.
I haven't seen him.

398
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,349
Well, if you bump into him, tell him
I'm looking forward to seeing him again.

399
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,036
Lex, do you ever stop and think
about where your life is heading?

400
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,711
All the time.

401
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,639
It's a complicated world, clark.

402
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,109
Only the naive view it
in black and white.

403
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,794
You know, the other day,
a professor of mine...

404
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,875
...he accused LuthorCorp of being evil,
and you being just short of the devil.

405
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,437
Well, you didn't tell him
about my pitchfork, did you?

406
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,718
I defended you.

407
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,035
I guess I am naive.

408
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,278
You got some awesome stuff
in here, bro.

409
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,671
Yeah, I got the feeling the ocean floor
is a little more interesting.

410
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,513
And it'll stay that way now,
thanks to you.

411
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,914
Well, I did have some help.

412
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,832
We do make a pretty good team, huh?

413
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,759
Maybe we should start up a Junior
Lifeguard Association or something.

414
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,158
I'm not sure I'm ready
for the JLA just yet.

415
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,913
Unless you promise
to stop blowing things up.

416
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,639
As long as Luthor sticks to dry land,
I'll keep the sea floor to myself.

417
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,432
But if anyone messes
with my home...

418
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,837
I don't think Leviathan's gonna be
a threat again, but Lex might.

419
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,638
He's seen your abilities.

420
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,837
He'll turn the world upside down
looking for you.

421
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,118
World's three-quarters water.
Good luck finding me.

422
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,153
What about school in Miami?

423
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,357
Guess the swim team might have
to find another handsome stud.

424
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,436
Just stay out of trouble, all right, AC.

425
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,438
Try to get in some, Clark.

426
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,196
Stay super, bro.

427
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,911
If you've dropped my class,
I hope you haven't come to apologize.

428
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,431
You were right...

429
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,798
...about Lex.

430
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,952
Of course, I was.
I'll never lie to you, Mr. Kent.

431
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,636
After all, I'm an educator.
The truth is my life's work.

432
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,993
It might be too late,
but I was wondering...

433
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,470
...if the research-assistant position
was still available.

434
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,908
It is, but I'm not interested in hiring
someone who changes their mind...

435
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,036
...as often
as they change their clothes.

436
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,869
Professor, I can't just sit back
and watch anymore.

437
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,238
If your book will expose the truth about
LuthorCorp, I want to be a part of it.

438
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,354
I expect my research assistants
to be smart, thorough...

439
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,034
...and to show up to every class.
- I can guarantee it.

440
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,952
All right.

441
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,512
You know, history shows us...

442
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,559
...that every decision a man makes
has an effect on the sum of his life.

443
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,590
You've made the right decision,
Mr. Kent.

444
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,397
You haven't learned, have you?

445
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,109
Orange and green,
totally hideous together.

446
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,555
I didn't think you were gonna show.

447
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,354
I just wanted to say goodbye.

448
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,678
You going to Miami?

449
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,153
No, I think
I'm gonna take some time off.

450
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,795
Float around for a little while,
see where the currents take me.

451
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,717
If those currents ever
bring you back to Smallville...

452
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,952
I don't think that's gonna happen.

453
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,993
Not for a while.

454
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,917
You know, my first week of college...

455
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,514
...the only book I opened
was <i>The Bartender's Guide...</i>

456
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,591
...and that was
the CliffsNotes version.

457
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,390
Well, I guess we're
two different types of students.

458
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,438
I hope so, for your sake.

459
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,434
Look, I know that I got a little thorny
when you raised the red flag on AC.

460
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,869
I was just trying to look out for you.

461
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,792
And I appreciate it.

462
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,871
I've never had someone
to help guide me...

463
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,156
...through the shark-infested
ocean of romance.

464
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,912
Not that I can't fend for myself.

465
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,153
You know, I think I was wrong
about our friend AC.

466
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,309
He was a little misguided...

467
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,275
...but his heart was in the right place.

468
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,154
Yeah, he was definitely unique.

469
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,872
I've known a lot of guys
who want to own the world.

470
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,237
I haven't met very many
who actually want to save it.

471
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,358
How am I ever gonna meet
someone like that again?

472
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,912
Lois, I promise, someday...

473
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,719
...you'll meet someone
even more special.

474
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,432
Last year we lost a true visionary.

475
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,716
Christopher Reeve's courage
inspired the world.

476
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,872
The Christopher Reeve Foundation
has launched the Superman Tags.

477
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,792
By purchasing these $ 10 tags online...

478
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,396
...you'll help realize christopher's dream
of finding a cure for paralysis.

479
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,868
Go forward.
