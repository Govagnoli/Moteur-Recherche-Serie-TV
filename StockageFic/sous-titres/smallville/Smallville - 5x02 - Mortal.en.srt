1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,076
I'm transferring the other patients
out of this wing, per your request.

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,151
But a reorganization of this size...

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,834
The board of directors
will ask questions, Mr. Luthor.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,993
For what I'm paying you, doctor,
I'm sure you can buy some answers.

5
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,874
Keep him isolated.

6
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,719
Twenty-four-hour surveillance.

7
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,509
Notify me immediately
if there's any change in his condition.

8
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,154
Hey!

9
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,992
Sorry about that, Mr. Luthor.

10
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,950
Yeah, my bad.

11
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,236
You're good at making friends,
aren't you, Lee?

12
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,913
I guess I'm just a people person.

13
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,598
Hey, he... He's out!

14
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,872
Can I light up a room or what!

15
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,070
Get your hands up. Get your hands up.

16
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,750
Time to do your thing, boys. Go, go.

17
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,871
Stop! Freeze!

18
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,752
- What's going on?
- Let's blow this joint.

19
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,671
- Where to...
- Now, boss?

20
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,831
Smallville.

21
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,831
Okay, pull!

22
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,036
Steady!

23
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,959
- Steady up! Pull!
- Left side.

24
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,509
Come on! Steady!

25
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,910
- Pull!
- Okay.

26
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,193
That's good.

27
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,398
Pull!

28
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,749
Almost there!

29
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,999
Okay, brace it.

30
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,871
- It's good?
- It's great.

31
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,758
It's a lot heavier than I remember.

32
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,150
You're just gonna have to learn
to pace yourself.

33
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,709
You're only human now, remember?

34
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,110
Martha!

35
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,432
The joys of manual labor.

36
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,591
It's not so bad. I kind of like being sore.

37
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,796
Makes me feel like
I accomplished something.

38
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,598
No pain, no gain, right?

39
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,549
Well, being a mere mortal
does have its drawbacks.

40
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,711
Are you all right?

41
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,270
Are you sure this is what
you really want?

42
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,239
It's what I've always wanted.

43
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,875
I was talking about you, Clark,
not your feelings for Lana.

44
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,316
I mean, one day I find out
my best friend's an <i>alien...</i>

45
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,550
...and then the next day,
presto change-o...

46
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,075
<i>...he's</i> just your average
Kansas farm boy.

47
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,913
Excuse me if I'm finding this
a little hard to accept.

48
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,196
Well, you're gonna have to
just get used to it.

49
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,635
This is who I am now.

50
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,189
Clark, with all that
you were able to do...

51
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,477
<i>...I</i> just can't help but thinking
that your destiny is more...

52
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,790
...than just milking cows
and raising barns.

53
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,871
Destiny is another word
for no choice.

54
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,395
Okay. What about
alien Ken and Barbie?

55
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,870
- They tore apart Smallville looking for...
- They were looking for Kal-EI.

56
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,031
They're gone, and so is he.

57
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,156
Just let it go, Chloe.

58
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,910
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

59
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,439
I've never been so thirsty.

60
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,513
It's incredible, isn't it, how the entire
town gets together to rebuild Smallville.

61
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,638
Thanks to Lex. If he hadn't
pulled those strings at FEMA...

62
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,951
- ...we'd still be waiting for relief money.
- Yeah, he's a real hero.

63
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,757
Hey, Clark?
We're getting low on nails.

64
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,593
- Can you run to the farm and grab some?
- Yeah.

65
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,991
- I'll come with you.
- Yeah.

66
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,237
The happy couple.

67
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,228
Sneaking off while
there's work to be done?

68
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,356
Supply run.

69
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,198
- I'll wait for you.
- Okay.

70
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,630
I get the feeling I'm not
her favorite person.

71
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,958
She doesn't trust you.

72
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,710
I'm sure you're used to that kind
of reaction from people by now.

73
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,879
Look, clark, we've all made mistakes.

74
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,758
That's in the past.

75
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,117
For whatever reason,
we've been given a second chance.

76
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,317
I hope we can rebuild
more than just the town.

77
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,078
So do I.

78
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,553
I can't believe a second meteor shower
hit Smallville.

79
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,190
Like the first, when we were kids,
wasn't bad enough.

80
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,316
Maybe this time it's different.

81
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,871
Maybe it's not the end of something
but the beginning, a second chance.

82
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,238
Clark, there are so many things
that I haven't told you.

83
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,958
Things that I've done.

84
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,391
Whatever we've both done,
it's in the past now.

85
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,438
The past can't hurt us anymore.

86
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,076
You're right.

87
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,439
No more crystals or spaceships
or meteor showers.

88
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,075
Sounds good to me.

89
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,151
- This will only take a second.
- No hurry.

90
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,914
I think I need a break anyway.

91
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,150
Found them.

92
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,551
You know, sometimes taking your time
isn't a bad idea.

93
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,718
Sorry.

94
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,877
It's okay.

95
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,713
We should probably
be heading back anyway.

96
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,918
You're right.

97
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,152
We should probably be heading back.

98
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,875
Everyone's waiting for us
at the barn raising.

99
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,838
Which means we're all alone.

100
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,878
Wait, we should...
We should take this slow.

101
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,632
Clark, we've been taking it slow
for four years now.

102
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,155
I know. It's <i>just...</i>

103
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,628
...I want our first time...

104
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,559
...to be as special as you are.

105
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,434
<i>It's...</i>

106
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,834
It's my first time.

107
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,552
It's mine too.

108
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,677
- You and Jason never...?
- No. No.

109
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,755
You and Alicia...?

110
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,672
No.

111
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,318
You're the only one
I've ever really loved.

112
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,559
It's only been you, Lana.

113
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,033
My parents.

114
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,430
Hey, Mom. Dad!

115
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,759
We were just...

116
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,112
We were just...

117
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,395
Clark!

118
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,348
Pretty girl. I approve.

119
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,191
- What do you want?
- What every freak in Belle Reve wants.

120
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,314
You!

121
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,153
Get in there!

122
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,311
- Sit down.
- Lana.

123
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,551
- Stop it!
- Stop?

124
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,911
Fun's just getting started, baby girl.

125
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,071
Clark, what's going on?
Who are they?

126
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,435
- I don't know.
- Oh, but we know you.

127
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,990
You're a legend in Belle Reve.
Half the freaks are there because of you.

128
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,832
What is he talking about?

129
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,560
- You got the wrong guy.
- Oh, yeah?

130
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,396
Well, maybe sweetmeat here knows
where I can find the right one.

131
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,113
No.

132
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,832
Clark!

133
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,316
Boy, you do not wanna
be pissing me off!

134
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,394
- Strange.
- He does not seem...

135
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,834
What we expected.

136
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,718
I told you, you got the wrong guy.

137
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,469
Well, then I guess we're just
gonna have to kill you.

138
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,029
Or maybe I should start
with your little girlfriend.

139
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,191
All right, Clark.

140
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,477
As long as you're happy
with who you are.

141
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,270
Happiness is such an elusive creature,
isn't it?

142
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,395
We all wish for it,
but very few ever really find it.

143
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,391
Doesn't make the search
less important.

144
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,195
Or the destination.

145
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,319
You remember the last time
we stood here together?

146
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,516
I ended up unconscious
on the ground...

147
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,955
...and you somehow landed
in the Arctic.

148
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,317
- I don't remember what happened.
- Then why have you been avoiding me?

149
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,430
It's been weeks since I brought you back
from the hospital in Yukon.

150
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,160
- I've been busy, Lex.
- Right.

151
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,869
I heard being a third wheel
is very time-consuming.

152
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,116
Clark and Lana are finally together.
They're happy.

153
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,191
That's all that should matter
to a friend.

154
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,560
I think you know more
than you're telling <i>me...</i>

155
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,190
...about what happened to you
in this cave, about clark's involvement.

156
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,272
You think you're a friend,
but you're playing a dangerous game.

157
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,509
Like covering up the spaceship Lana said
crashed during the meteor shower?

158
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,433
Lana was hysterical.
She didn't see what she thought.

159
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,232
Well, maybe you didn't either, Lex.

160
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,597
Stop asking me questions
or I will start asking my own.

161
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,434
Level 3?

162
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,556
So you've heard of it?

163
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,238
Yeah. It's supposed to be a top-secret
research facility at LuthorCorp.

164
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,992
Everybody thinks it's just a myth.

165
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,469
Spending a couple weeks in there
can make it real.

166
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,794
You've been in Level 3?

167
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,317
Oh, yeah, I had a real nice stay:

168
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,436
Gourmet food, satellite TV...

169
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,797
...and a nifty green cocktail
shot in my neck three times a day.

170
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,509
- They were experimenting on you?
- Trying to amp up what we could do.

171
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,477
And it worked.

172
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,991
Then one morning
I woke up in Belle Reve.

173
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,869
No more satellite TV,
no more green cocktails.

174
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,553
Got you hooked and cut you off.

175
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,155
We all got our cross to bear,
and this is yours:

176
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,198
You're gonna break into Level 3,
you're gonna get that <i>serum...</i>

177
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,749
...otherwise you're gonna play
all by your Ionesome.

178
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,396
What do you need me for?

179
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,959
I've seen what you can do.

180
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,793
- Just go and get it yourself.
- They got defense systems...

181
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,030
...to keep people like me out.

182
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,590
But if the stories I hear about you
in Belle Reve are true...

183
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,352
<i>...you</i> shouldn't have any problem.

184
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,356
Looks like we got ourselves
some company.

185
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,994
Clark better have an excuse
for not bringing those nails.

186
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,071
I'm sure he does.

187
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,516
Clark?

188
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,953
Clark, we sent you
after those nails hours ago.

189
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,031
- What happened?
- I got sidetracked.

190
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,031
Where's Lana?

191
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,953
She's not feeling well.
She's lying down.

192
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,071
Why is your shirt on inside out?

193
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,471
- I think I'll go check on Lana.
- No! Wait!

194
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,710
You never believe me!
Why are you all over me?

195
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,795
- Can't you back off for five minutes?
- Clark Kent. What's gotten into you?

196
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,317
Yeah, boy!
That ain't no way to talk to your mama.

197
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,119
- What's going on here, clark?
- Pipe down, old man.

198
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,116
Listen, fella, I don't know who the hell
you think you're talking to...

199
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,351
Stop! Just stop.

200
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,431
I'll do what you want.
Don't hurt anyone.

201
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,872
Smart move, farm boy.

202
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,918
You got two hours
to get back here with the serum...

203
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,311
<i>...or</i> I'm gonna fire me up
a family barbecue.

204
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,596
All I know is the serum is in a vault
somewhere in there on Level 3.

205
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,832
What about Lex? I mean,
if we just told him what was going on...

206
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,070
No, I called.
He's en route to Washington.

207
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,753
It's up to us. We gotta get in.

208
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,073
Well, I'm always up
for a little Mission: Impossible.

209
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,198
Okay, so this is where your nut job
said he was experimented in?

210
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,952
- Yeah.
- According to records...

211
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,953
...this section of LuthorCorp
was closed a year ago.

212
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,394
Turned into storage.

213
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,278
Great cover
if you don't want <i>anyone...</i>

214
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,954
- <i>...to</i> know what you're up to.
- Exactly what I thought.

215
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,272
Now, I couldn't pull up anything called
"Top Secret Evil Lab" on the schematics.

216
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,752
But I did find this.
Or, more accurately, didn't.

217
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,875
- Level 3.
- Guess someone forgot to pencil that in.

218
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,118
What? I like to come prepared.

219
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,714
- Chloe, where'd you get all this stuff?
- EBay.

220
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,599
Hey. Is that a flash-bang grenade?

221
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,435
Careful! It was a graduation present
from Lois.

222
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,830
I'm saving it for a special occasion.

223
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,911
Why didn't you tell me
about this stuff?

224
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,953
We all have our secrets, Clark.

225
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,355
Relax. We still got a couple of minutes
before the guards swing back around.

226
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,671
- You sure this is gonna work?
- You got a better plan?

227
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,152
Well, normally I'd just rip open the door,
then super-speed past the cameras...

228
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,039
...and somehow open the vault
with my heat vision.

229
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,597
So you're saying now that you're human,
you have no useful skills?

230
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,388
- Not so much.
- Great.

231
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,394
Finally land my own superhero
and this is what I get.

232
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,270
But we don't need
superpowers for this.

233
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,556
Get the door open
and then access the cameras.

234
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,358
Then loop the hallway over and over.

235
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,476
- And then I'Il...
- Clark.

236
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,791
That kind of electronic hocus-pocus
is gonna take hours to rig up.

237
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,871
Sometimes it's easier if you <i>just...</i>

238
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,035
...turn off the power.

239
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,390
Looks like the kid went
and called the law.

240
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,358
- He doesn't love you much.
- Clark wouldn't go to the police.

241
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,273
- It's just routine.
- Yeah, well, too bad for her then.

242
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,192
We'll get rid of her. Don't freak out.

243
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,433
Baby, you'll know when I freak out.

244
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,310
Get rid of the sheriff
or your wife's toast.

245
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,198
Martha.

246
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,237
Just a second.

247
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,148
- Sheriff.
- I'm sorry to trouble you <i>folks...</i>

248
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,074
...but three real mean cusses
busted out of Belle Reve last night.

249
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,079
Put guards in the hospital...

250
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,356
...and we found the car they stole
up the road.

251
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,273
- We'll keep our eyes open.
- Yeah, you be sure and do that.

252
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,354
Where's the missus?

253
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,118
She's still at the barn raising.

254
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,759
I was just there, I didn't see her.

255
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,477
Well, make sure she knows
what's going on when she turns up.

256
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,198
I sure will. Thank you.

257
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,191
Wait a minute.

258
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,748
Is that coffee I smell?

259
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,079
We're running out of time.

260
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,549
- There's gotta be another way.
- Clark, there isn't.

261
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,358
The only direct access to Level 3...

262
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,398
...is through a magnetically sealed door
with power backup.

263
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,109
You have to get in through the vents
and unlock the mag-Iocks from inside.

264
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,633
How much further?

265
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,199
According to the diagram...

266
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,069
...you should be getting close to an
exhaust port right above no man's land.

267
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,476
Take your next left.

268
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,039
<i>Come on, Clark, left.</i>

269
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,836
- I'm going in circles.
- No, you're not.

270
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,312
It just feels that way because you're in
a confined space with no visual markers.

271
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,708
This is impossible.
It's a million degrees in here.

272
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,678
Gosh, I didn't realize super-whining
was one of your powers.

273
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,593
Pete was a lot better at pep talks
in these situations.

274
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,079
Pete?

275
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,798
You told Pete your secret?

276
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,996
I kind of had to. He saw my ship.

277
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,233
Pete got to see your spaceship?

278
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,473
What was that?

279
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,799
<i>Oh, no.</i>

280
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,030
You tripped some sort
of lockdown protocol.

281
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,519
What?

282
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,318
- Well, what do I do?
- Go.

283
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,038
Go, go, go.

284
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,471
<i>Make a left.</i>

285
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,914
Clark, I said left.

286
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,310
<i>Go, Clark. Hurry. Hurry.</i>

287
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,674
<i>Clark? Clark, are you all right?</i>

288
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,956
Clark? Clark, are you okay?

289
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,152
Yeah. Super.

290
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,397
Good coffee, Mr. Kent.

291
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,357
Thank you, sheriff.

292
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,592
You mind if I finish my chores
while there's still some daylight?

293
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,593
Oh, right.
Yeah, I should get going myself.

294
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,198
Thanks for the coffee.

295
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,750
Wouldn't think a man
with your heart condition...

296
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,672
...would take to smoking, Mr. Kent.

297
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,311
Oh, those are mine, sheriff.

298
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,153
You know,
I started after the meteor shower.

299
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,913
Nerves.

300
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,470
Nasty habit, Miss Lang.
You ought to quit before they kill you.

301
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,597
Thanks again for the hospitality.

302
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,591
I'll let myself out.

303
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,549
All units. We got a 10-11
out at the Kent farm.

304
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,508
- I repeat, a 10-11 out at Kent farm.
- Oh, sheriff.

305
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,996
Mr. Kent!

306
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,474
- That really...
- Hurt!

307
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,718
Get the field up!

308
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,551
Get down.

309
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,033
Check him out!

310
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,954
Well, ain't this a right pickle.

311
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,239
<i>Clark, how's it going?</i>

312
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,393
Well, I'm not really crazy
about heights.

313
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,678
Okay.

314
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,036
Chloe, what am I looking for?

315
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,909
<i>Okay, just a really big door.</i>

316
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,949
Big door. Big door.

317
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,554
- Got it.
- <i>Okay.</i>

318
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,190
<i>Now look for</i>
<i>the manual override switch.</i>

319
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,239
Good work.

320
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,231
You didn't have
any trouble with guards.

321
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,799
No, it was weird actually.

322
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,191
It was like they were only guarding
the perimeter outside.

323
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,994
Can you get us in?

324
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,714
No.

325
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,633
The locking mechanism's
controlled by fingerprint access.

326
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,438
There's gotta be a way to bypass it.

327
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,434
Maybe if I had, like, a week,
or Lex's thumb...

328
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,474
Lex's thumbprint.

329
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,434
What?

330
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,914
What the hell is this, sheriff?

331
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,870
Another day in Smallville.

332
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,589
- We cannot...
- Maintain the field.

333
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,038
Finishing each other's sentences
is really starting to grate on me.

334
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,270
- We need...
- The serum.

335
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,714
You ain't the only ones.

336
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,519
You keep that field up, all right?
We're almost home.

337
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,635
- Perhaps we should...
- Cut...

338
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,798
- Our losses.
- No!

339
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,589
No! We're gonna stick to the plan,
wait for the Kent boy to get back...

340
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,311
<i>...and</i> then we're off the hook. So you
guys shut up, and you concentrate.

341
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,631
Is it just me,
or are they starting to look desperate?

342
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,677
Don't worry, Mrs. Kent.

343
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,229
Clark will figure a way
to get us out of this.

344
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,118
He always does.

345
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,433
- Is that gonna do it?
- It better, it's our last clean print.

346
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,989
All right, hand me the tape.

347
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,037
Thank you.

348
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,072
Hello?

349
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,389
Time's up, bright boy.

350
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,311
<i>I want my stuff.</i>

351
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,190
- I got it. I'm on my way.
- You better be.

352
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,196
Who needs superpowers
with you around?

353
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,117
Clark.

354
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,356
He's got a couple of minutes, and then
I'm gonna start killing me some people.

355
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,514
Starting with you, Mom.

356
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,829
Can you disrupt the signal?
Might shut the grid down.

357
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,434
I could try,
but that could take hours.

358
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,636
Chloe, I already told him
I had the serum.

359
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,997
- Call. See if he can give you more time.
- He's not a "more time" guy.

360
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,469
We don't have a choice.
You can't just walk in.

361
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,791
Without your abilities,
the lasers will cut you to pieces.

362
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,719
There might be one other way.

363
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,718
- Find where the signal's coming from.
- What are you gonna do?

364
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,550
Whatever it takes.

365
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,078
- Sheriff!
- Hey, hey.

366
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,549
- Sheriff!
- Let him through!

367
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,035
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm trying to save my parents and Lana.

368
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,519
Please, pull your men back.

369
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,672
Last time I checked, I was wearing
the badge and barking orders.

370
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,354
- I can stop this.
- This is not the time to be a hero.

371
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,953
I'm not!

372
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,318
Look, I'm just a normal guy that doesn't
wanna see everyone he loves die.

373
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,756
Please, sheriff, you have to trust me,
I can do this.

374
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,598
Even if I lost all sense
and I gave you the okay...

375
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,550
...there is some kind of invisible barrier
or whatnot around the whole place.

376
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,872
How do you plan to get past that?

377
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,669
With this.

378
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,956
Nice and easy.
I'm feeling kind of twitchy.

379
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,156
- Get the force field down!
- He did it.

380
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,869
Look, shut up.
He ain't done nothing yet.

381
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,953
All right, get the field back up.
Get it up!

382
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,034
Get it up!

383
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,829
- Starting to wonder if you forgot us.
- Everything's gonna be okay.

384
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,513
Ain't nothing okay till I say so.

385
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,319
They really did a job on you
at Luthorcorp, didn't they?

386
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,278
Look, they made me more than I was.
I didn't ask for <i>it...</i>

387
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,591
...but the power grows on you
really fast.

388
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,909
I guess all the talk
about you is true, kid.

389
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,992
- You really are out of this world.
- You have no idea.

390
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,754
God!

391
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,275
Oh, God! You little son of a...

392
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,956
Sometimes it's easier
just to turn the power off.

393
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,193
- Get him out of here.
- Let's go.

394
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,151
Keep moving, Sparky.

395
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,717
That guy has some serious issues.

396
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,996
Let's hope Belle Reve
can hold him this time.

397
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,390
Or you can always
knock his lights out again.

398
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:09,314
Or call the authorities before you hatch
another harebrained rescue scheme.

399
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,509
Sorry, sheriff.

400
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,389
That aside, nice work, Mr. Kent.

401
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,755
You ever consider a career
in law enforcement?

402
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,475
She's right, clark.

403
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,517
What you did was amazing.

404
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,477
Hi.

405
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,872
Hey.

406
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,273
- Give us a second?
- Of course.

407
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,035
Breaking news:
Clark Kent saves the day.

408
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,317
- Yeah, thanks to you.
- Yeah, well, I just did what I usually do.

409
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,756
You're the one that took down
three meteor freaks without any...

410
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,717
...special advantages.

411
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,671
- Then again, once a hero, always a hero.
- No. It's a one-time thing.

412
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,478
I'm done with all that now.

413
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,038
Clark, you may have moved on...

414
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,237
...but people are not gonna let go...
- We talked about this.

415
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,834
I'm not the one
you should worry about.

416
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,069
I traced the signal
I picked up in the vault.

417
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,074
I found a secondary video feed
hidden in the frequency.

418
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,231
Someone was watching us.

419
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,395
- This isn't possible.
- Disappointed?

420
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,993
Clark.

421
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,592
I heard. Is everyone all right?

422
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,631
- What are you doing?
- What I should've done a long time ago.

423
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,549
Chloe traced the video feed
from Level 3.

424
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,597
You were watching us the whole time.

425
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,552
I don't know
what you're talking about.

426
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,352
She pulled records from Belle Reve.

427
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,875
You were there the day
those psychos escaped.

428
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,508
And you helped them somehow,
didn't you?

429
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,237
What did you promise them, Lex?
Serum to last the rest of their lives?

430
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,790
- You're being irrational.
- This whole thing was a setup, a test!

431
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,955
And to do it, you put Lana
and my family in danger.

432
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,395
- Clark...
- No!

433
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,632
I thought we could start over, Lex.

434
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,395
But you're too obsessed with the past,
with me.

435
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,957
But I'm different now,
and I'm through playing games with you.

436
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,394
You wanna test me?

437
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,233
Wanna see what I'm really made of?
Do it yourself, coward.

438
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,197
Satisfied?

439
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,758
Clark.

440
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,799
What happened?

441
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,474
Had to say goodbye to an old friend.

442
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,711
Have you ever heard of a handshake?

443
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,716
Come here.

444
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,750
All right.

445
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,117
Sorry.

446
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,792
God, you're a mess.

447
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,593
After everything that's <i>happened...</i>

448
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,755
...I thought I knew what my life
would be like now.

449
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,553
I thought...

450
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,029
...it would be easier.

451
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,154
But I guess you can never be certain
what's gonna happen <i>tomorrow...</i>

452
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,916
...can you?

453
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,037
No.

454
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,437
No, you can't.

455
