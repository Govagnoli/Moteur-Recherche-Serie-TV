1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:04,400
Previously on Smallville:

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,506
- I think Lex has a piece of the spaceship.
- Are you sure?

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:11,075
Roger Nixon. I'm a journalist,
and I'd like to write a story about you.

4
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:14,008
- Whitney's going off to join the Marines.
- Really?

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,238
If you're gonna take me on, son...

6
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,350
...you're gonna have to bring your game
up to a whole different level.

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,418
Just promise me Saturday night's
gonna be great.

8
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:21,815
It'll be a night you won't forget.

9
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:24,821
There's a whole lot more to your friend
Clark Kent than meets the eye.

10
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,253
You'd better pray you're not wrong.

11
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,056
You're not my enemy. You're my son.

12
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,995
I believe the term is, "Cry havoc
and let slip the dogs of war."

13
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,775
- Lana's there.
- Don't worry. I'm sure she's home by now.

14
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,207
I'll tell the entire world about your son!

15
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,112
Jonathan, look!

16
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,290
Damn it!

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,194
Help me!

18
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:05,689
But he knows everything!

19
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,766
- I will not let him destroy this family.
- No! Please!

20
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,063
Jonathan!

21
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,367
Clark!

22
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,808
No!

23
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,040
And now, the season premiere of Smallville.

24
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,601
Lex!

25
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,007
I'm your father!

26
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:36,878
Son!

27
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,809
Dad!

28
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,946
Dad! No!

29
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,374
Nixon!

30
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,885
- Give me the camera!
- Get the hell away from me!

31
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,791
Lana?

32
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,358
Lana.

33
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,536
I need help!

34
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,000
I need a doctor here!

35
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,341
- I need help. Now.
- What have we got?

36
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,575
Pupils are responsive.

37
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,751
Respiration appears normal.

38
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,588
Got a good pulse.

39
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,590
She's gonna be all right.
Can you tell me her name?

40
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,399
Mom! Dad!

41
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,233
Mom? Mom! Mom!

42
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,673
- Mom, you okay?
- Clark! Clark.

43
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,814
We have to find your father.
He was outside when the tornado hit.

44
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,677
- I'm gonna get you to a hospital.
- No, Clark, listen to me.

45
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,147
- That reporter was in the cellar.
- Nixon?

46
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,221
He videotaped the ship.
He's gonna expose your secret.

47
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:33,948
- Your father chased him out into the storm.
- I've gotta find them.

48
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,862
Mom? Where's the ship?

49
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:48,773
There's swelling in his vertebrae, resulting
in partial loss of nerve control in his legs.

50
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,171
His spleen is ruptured...

51
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,309
...and he's sustained severe trauma
to his optic nerve.

52
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,677
I want a medevac to Metropolis General.
I want a team of specialists.

53
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,410
Your father's critical.
Moving him is not an option.

54
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,350
- This isn't just any patient.
- I know who Lionel Luthor is.

55
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:07,516
- I cannot give him any special treatment.
- That's not what I meant.

56
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,864
He's my father.
Do everything you can for him.

57
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,766
Lex.

58
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,267
Lex.

59
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,475
Yeah, Dad, I'm here.

60
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,307
Don't worry.

61
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,849
I'll fly in specialists from Metropolis
to personally supervise your case.

62
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,145
I saw it...

63
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,687
...in your eyes, son...

64
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,254
...what you were thinking.

65
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:45,790
Life would be so easy...

66
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,093
...if I was out of your way.

67
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,434
Dad, I'm sorry.

68
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,082
Dad!

69
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,054
- Dad!
- He hasn't been back to the house!

70
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,986
Did you call the sheriff?
The hospital?

71
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,749
- The phones are down.
- Dad grew up in tornado country.

72
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:19,125
- The first thing he'd do is take shelter.
- I don't know if he was thinking straight.

73
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,528
I've never seen your father that angry.

74
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,363
He said he wasn't gonna let Nixon
destroy our family.

75
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,230
Do you think he...?

76
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,838
No, he would never do that.

77
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:49,224
Oh, no! I won't say anything
about your son, I swear to God!

78
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,087
Please! Don't kill me!

79
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,965
Oh, God.

80
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,801
- Oh, God. I thought you were gonna kill me.
- Yeah, you would think that.

81
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,416
- Hey, Dorothy, back from Oz?
- Chloe.

82
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,612
What are you doing?
Shouldn't you be in bed?

83
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,986
I'm okay. The doctor says
it's just a mild concussion.

84
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,658
Besides, a lot of people need this bed
a lot more than I do.

85
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,161
Well, I'm just glad you're okay.
What happened?

86
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:31,668
Well, I was driving back after dropping
Whitney off, when the wind picked up.

87
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:37,036
This mailbox slammed against
my windshield, and I went off the road.

88
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,235
That's when I saw the twisters.

89
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,846
- Before I knew it, the truck was sucked up.
- God.

90
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:48,646
You walked away with a small bump. That's
amazing, even by Smallville standards.

91
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,619
- No, it's impossible.
- What?

92
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,817
Nothing. The next thing I knew,
I was waking up here.

93
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:59,397
So you clicked your heels, said, "There's
no place like home," and ended up here.

94
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,829
Apparently Clark brought me in.

95
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:05,197
- Clark?
- Yeah, have you seen him?

96
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:09,334
No, not since he vanished from the dance.
I spent three hours looking for him.

97
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,375
Guess the Spring Formal was
kind of a bust, huh?

98
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:16,441
Yeah, well, at least now I know
where he disappeared to.

99
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:21,146
If it's any consolation,
you guys looked great together.

100
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,014
It's not, but thanks.

101
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,530
Dad?

102
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,501
Clark, I ran into your mother at the
hospital. She told me about your dad.

103
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:43,039
I checked every acre of this place,
I gotta head for the woods.

104
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,275
Clark.

105
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,038
My father was injured in the twister.
He's in pretty bad shape.

106
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:56,286
- Lex, I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do?
- It's in the doctor's hands now.

107
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,517
During the storm, my father was trapped
beneath a column.

108
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,526
If I hadn't pulled him out,
he would've died.

109
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,590
Before I did, I hesitated.

110
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,972
I was thinking that maybe my life would
be better off if I just left him to die.

111
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,973
- You saved him, that's the important part.
- No.

112
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:23,639
My father won't see it that way.
Forgiveness is not in his emotional lexicon.

113
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:27,081
If anything, he'll probably see
my saving him as a sign of weakness.

114
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,284
What are you gonna do?

115
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,222
Help my friend find his dad.

116
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,157
You got another flashlight?

117
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,330
- Dad!
- Mr. Kent!

118
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,401
Mr. Kent!

119
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,174
Dad!

120
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,969
- Do you know whose car that is?
- No.

121
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:22,301
I think we can cover more ground
if we split up.

122
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,941
Yeah.

123
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:27,169
- I'll meet you back here in a half-hour.
- Okay.

124
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,827
Great.

125
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,635
What are you doing?

126
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,930
Looking for my cell phone.

127
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,005
It's our only hope.

128
00:12:56,242 --> 00:13:00,338
The greatest story in human history, and
I'm not gonna get a chance to write it.

129
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,606
Clark is not a story, he's my son.

130
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,548
And I'm not gonna let you sabotage
his life while you make yourself famous.

131
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:11,019
Is that why you chased me?
What were you planning on doing, Kent?

132
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,886
Were you gonna bludgeon me
and bury me in a shallow grave?

133
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:18,496
You were trespassing on my property,
and you tried to kill my son in that truck.

134
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:25,069
You have the most amazing being on Earth
doing chores on your farm.

135
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:30,669
Why are you hiding him? Tell the world
and let them see for themselves.

136
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,539
I think I should leave that up to him
for when he's older.

137
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:37,011
Well, when do you suppose that'll be?
Draft age? Drinking age?

138
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,480
When he's ready.

139
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,745
Why don't you stop playing the protector
and admit the truth.

140
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:45,084
You kept him because you couldn't
have children of your own.

141
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:49,455
We kept him because he is our son
and we love him.

142
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:53,155
He's not your son, you deluded hick!

143
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,527
He's not even human.

144
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,003
You can kill me for saying this,
but you know I'm right.

145
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:07,612
You're just a small man whose son's
destiny is too big for you to comprehend.

146
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:15,285
Clark doesn't belong to you.
He belongs to the world.

147
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,424
Hello? Lex?

148
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,458
Nixon? Where the hell are you?

149
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:33,166
You stupid son of a bitch!
I thought you wanted to get out of here!

150
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,706
I did want out of here, till I realized
you were in bed with Lex Luthor.

151
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:41,711
And I would rather rot down here than
watch the two of you destroy my son's life!

152
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,944
Nixon, you still there?

153
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:53,387
Just calling the fire department
so we can get a rescue team out here.

154
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,051
No, you weren't.
I heard you trying to talk to Roger Nixon.

155
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,289
He was at the farm today.
He was with my dad when the tornado hit.

156
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,366
Clark, I didn't know Nixon was involved.

157
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,970
Why should I believe you?
You already lied about knowing him once.

158
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,673
That's the second time you've
hesitated today.

159
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,311
Maybe what my dad said about you
is true.

160
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,776
Clark, wait.

161
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:18,474
- You're tired and upset.
- Don't try to turn this around on me!

162
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,745
Are you really here to find my dad,
or to find Nixon?

163
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,146
- Do you even have to ask?
- I don't have time for this.

164
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,054
- I've gotta find my dad.
- Clark!

165
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,159
Dad!

166
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,738
I'll talk to the Red Cross people...

167
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,812
...see if they have any new information
about your father.

168
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,312
Clark.

169
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,578
- Any luck?
- We looked all night.

170
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,983
The search-and-rescue team
combed the farm but didn't find anything.

171
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,421
I don't know what to do,
he's been missing for over 12 hours.

172
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,225
You'll find him, Clark. I know it.

173
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,698
Thanks.

174
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:12,260
- I thought you'd be home recuperating.
- I wanted to help.

175
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:17,074
You know, a lot of people helped me out
after the meteor shower. Meant a lot.

176
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,271
I'm just glad you're okay.

177
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,874
So how did you find me?

178
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,612
I was lucky, I guess.
You were in a field next to the road.

179
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,655
You must have been thrown free
from the truck.

180
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,853
Is that really what happened?

181
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,391
Yeah.

182
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,661
Why?

183
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,861
I just keep seeing something
that doesn't make any sense.

184
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:49,474
The truck was caught up in the tornado,
and you...

185
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,572
You just...

186
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,743
Clark.

187
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,044
No new word.

188
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,278
I'd better get back to work.
You'll find him.

189
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:05,383
I'm gonna stay and work the phones. If
anybody's seen or found him, they'll call in.

190
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,685
They discovered an old couple
trapped in their garage this morning.

191
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,556
So there's still hope.

192
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:14,059
Dad's missing because of me.
I brought this upon us.

193
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:18,431
You can't blame yourself.
You can't change who you are.

194
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:21,573
As long as you live,
people will try to exploit you.

195
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,766
Your father and I have tried to shelter you
as long as possible...

196
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,241
...but one day we won't be there for you.

197
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,177
You'll have to carry the burden
of your gifts on your own.

198
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,476
- Don't say that, Mom.
- When your day comes...

199
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:36,417
...I have no doubt in my heart
that you'll make us proud.

200
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,214
Now go back out there.

201
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,237
These old foundations, they mix lead in
with the cement for stability.

202
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:57,364
- Afraid we're gonna die of lead poisoning?
- Clark can't see through lead.

203
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,869
He can see through solid objects?

204
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:05,049
Unbelievable. What else can he do?

205
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,309
Do you have any idea
what I'd do with his abilities?

206
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,979
The wealth, the power he
could amass, it's unimaginable.

207
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:16,059
You are exactly the reason why
I keep his abilities a secret.

208
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:19,220
If it wasn't me,
it would've been someone else.

209
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,958
It was just a matter of time
before the story got out.

210
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:25,126
- Yeah.
- The people have a right to know.

211
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,671
Without any regard to the consequences
to my son.

212
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,970
Mr. Kent...

213
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:36,414
...since the beginning of time, people have
been looking at the stars, and wondering:

214
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,482
"What's out there?"

215
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:43,347
Clark is the answer
that they have been waiting for.

216
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,888
- I think I know a way out of here.
- You gonna tell me what that is?

217
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,430
You give me the tape of the ship,
and I will.

218
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,465
That's not gonna happen.

219
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:00,162
It's your life or your story.

220
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,830
You've gotta decide which is
more important to you.

221
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,242
I have.

222
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,730
You gonna share your plan with me?

223
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:42,470
Feel that. Go on.

224
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,717
- The mortar's weaker here.
- Yeah.

225
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:52,687
If we can get through here, I'm sure that
we can tunnel up to the surface.

226
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,967
- Clark.
- What do you want?

227
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,599
I should have come out
and told you the truth right away.

228
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,835
I do know Roger Nixon.
I was just trying to protect you.

229
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,036
Protect me from what?

230
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,884
Before the tornado,
Nixon approached me.

231
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,486
He offered to sell me information
about your family.

232
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,552
- What kind of information?
- It doesn't matter. He's a liar.

233
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,159
He'll do anything for a story.

234
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:33,627
I warned him to stay away
from your family. When I saw his car, I...

235
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,735
I realized he might have had something
to do with your father's disappearance.

236
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,537
Why didn't you tell me before?

237
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,266
I didn't want to alarm you
unless I knew for sure.

238
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,468
You know, Lex, I don't know what
to believe anymore.

239
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,412
Believe that I'm your friend.

240
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,083
I've got something to show you.

241
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,719
- What's that?
- It's a map.

242
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,253
A cellular frequency grid, to be exact.

243
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,591
I had my people look into it.

244
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,102
Only one cell tower survived the storm,
meaning Nixon, and possibly your father...

245
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,331
...had to be within a one-mile radius of
where we were last night.

246
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:18,135
I don't know if it will help,
but it's worth a shot.

247
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,643
- Mr. Kent!
- Dad!

248
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:27,945
- Well, this is the edge of the grid.
- There are no structures marked on the map.

249
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,747
Sorry, Clark.

250
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,422
Wait, what's that?

251
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,323
The twister must have dropped it here.

252
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,506
- He's not in here.
- What are you, part bloodhound?

253
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,704
Yeah. How do you know? Mr. Kent!

254
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,248
Dad!

255
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:00,411
Mr. Kent!

256
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:03,076
- Did you hear that?
- It's the kids. Chloe! Pete!

257
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,813
- Help!
- We're down here!

258
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,756
They can't hear us! They can't.
I gotta keep on digging. Go!

259
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,894
Roger, take it easy! It's not stable
down here.

260
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,297
I got your legs!

261
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,999
Hang on!

262
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,234
Did you hear something?

263
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,821
Come on, let's start again.

264
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:40,580
- Mr. Kent?
- Dad!

265
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,452
Here we see a terrifying example
of the tornado's fury.

266
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,522
This truck was literally ripped apart.

267
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,060
Incredibly, the young driver, Lana Lang,
survived.

268
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:20,756
Reminding us that, even in the midst
of utter devastation, miracles can happen.

269
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:23,662
It must have been awful for you.

270
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:28,129
Yeah. I don't think I've ever been
that scared in my entire life.

271
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,501
I'm glad you're all right.

272
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,677
Thanks for all your help, Mrs. Kent.

273
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,680
- I know it must be hard for you right now.
- I'm a saint.

274
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:43,478
I just can't believe how familiar
all this feels.

275
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,021
- The meteor shower?
- Yeah. God.

276
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:49,854
- I remember it like it was yesterday.
- Yeah, me too.

277
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,895
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to dredge up bad memories.

278
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,464
It's okay. For so long it seemed
to define me.

279
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,660
That fairy princess picture
on Time magazine.

280
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:04,438
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
you made one wish come true that day.

281
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,238
Jonathan and I were in Nell's buying
flowers, right before the meteor shower...

282
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,811
...and you were sitting on the counter
with your wings and wand...

283
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:15,578
...and you asked me if I wanted
to make a wish, so I did.

284
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:19,048
And not long after that,
Clark came into our lives.

285
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,184
I've never even told Clark that story.

286
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,958
Clark is so lucky to have you and Mr. Kent
as parents.

287
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:35,564
I've always been kind of envious.
You seem so open.

288
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,807
I'm glad that you and Clark
have become close.

289
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,480
Yeah. Me too.

290
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,444
- Mr. Kent!
- Mr. Kent?

291
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,581
Mr. Kent!

292
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,517
Chloe?

293
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:59,821
I've been wanting to apologize
for leaving you at the formal.

294
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,559
Didn't I tell you that leaving in the
middle of a tornado to save a friend...

295
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,532
...totally gets you off the hook?

296
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:09,299
- Besides, I know you'd do the same for me.
- Oh, in a heartbeat.

297
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,738
So how can I make it up to you?

298
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,844
Actually, you know, I've been thinking.

299
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,209
It's funny how a natural disaster
puts your life in perspective.

300
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:20,545
But I think it might be better
if we just stay really good friends.

301
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,517
Anything other than that
just gets too complicated.

302
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,359
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

303
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,762
- You do?
- Yeah.

304
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:38,334
Yeah, our friendship is so important to me,
the last thing I want to do is screw it up.

305
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:44,899
Good. Great. Perfect. I'm really glad
we got that straightened out.

306
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,275
I'm gonna check over here.

307
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:51,074
Okay, I'll catch up in a sec.
My feet are throbbing.

308
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,357
Mr. Kent!

309
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,526
- Hey.
- Hey.

310
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:11,124
- What's up with the fake smile?
- Nothing.

311
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,501
Clark and I just reaffirmed
that we're really good friends.

312
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,504
And nothing else.

313
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:24,140
- Pulled the "friends" card on you, huh?
- No, I did.

314
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,307
Defense mechanism.

315
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,453
Listen, Chloe...

316
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,483
...it's okay to feel bummed out.

317
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,224
Last night was supposed to be special...

318
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,986
...and it got ruined.

319
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,865
It was just so close to being perfect.

320
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:48,702
Listen to me, I sound so pathetic.
A tornado hit, people are in real trouble...

321
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:54,038
...and I'm upset because Clark
didn't fulfill my wish-fulfillment fantasy.

322
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,139
You must think I'm an awful person.

323
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:01,783
Yeah, you're a real monster.

324
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,452
Come on.

325
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,124
I can't breathe.

326
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:16,263
The cave-in must have cut off
the air supply.

327
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:32,413
Dying in a tomb, that's ironic.

328
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:37,019
At least you've got a legacy
to leave behind.

329
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,288
That's something to be proud of.

330
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,358
First time Clark used his abilities...

331
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,099
...he'd crawled under...

332
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:55,371
...a big oak bed that my grandfather
had made, and I...

333
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:00,170
I crawled underneath to try and get
him out, and then, all of a sudden, the...

334
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,007
The frame just came up in the air.

335
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:10,782
He was a toddler lifting, I don't know what
it was, 500 pounds over his head.

336
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:12,217
What did you do?

337
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,326
We decided to take him to a doctor
or a scientist.

338
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,389
Somebody more equipped...

339
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:22,460
...to understand than we were.

340
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:29,037
But when we got in front of the office,
Martha said that if we left him there...

341
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:35,334
...that they would want to keep him,
and we'd never see him again.

342
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,173
So I took him home.

343
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,852
Now, that may have been a mistake.

344
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,319
But it was a mistake
I'd gladly make again.

345
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,064
Time is of the essence.

346
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,863
The spine may heal, but the optic nerve
will get worse if it goes untreated.

347
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:03,872
- So surgery's the only option.
- No, I recommend against this.

348
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:07,443
I say, let the patient's condition stabilize
before surgery is attempted.

349
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:11,742
Yes, surgery's risky, but the alternative
could be worse.

350
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,242
It's your decision.

351
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,647
Do it.

352
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,622
Fine.

353
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,858
Where'd you get these maps?

354
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,553
My mom borrowed them
from the county planner's office.

355
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,961
They list every zoning change
going back to 1920.

356
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:32,968
Look, the plans from 1988 show
an old church near Hobson's Pond.

357
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:36,505
- I've never seen a church there.
- It was destroyed in the meteor shower.

358
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,107
According to this,
there's a crypt in the basement.

359
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,404
Your dad could have known about it.

360
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:45,683
I was right there. The motor home must
have been concealing the entrance.

361
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,581
Clark! You can't dig him out
on your own.

362
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:54,248
Clark, Pete and I'll go into town. We'll get
a rescue team and meet you out there.

363
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,854
Okay!

364
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,314
- Dad!
- Clark!

365
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,482
- Dad!
- Clark.

366
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,695
Kent, what's happening to him?

367
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,966
You gotta get him away
from the meteor rocks.

368
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,300
They make him sick.

369
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,536
Come on, get him out of here!

370
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,449
What are you doing?

371
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,358
I don't need the tape. I got all
the evidence I need right here.

372
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,187
What are you doing?

373
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:08,297
Nixon! You don't understand!

374
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,865
The rocks...

375
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:11,834
Clark...

376
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,480
Oh, son of a...

377
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:36,453
You're not...

378
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,561
...taking my son!

379
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,780
Like I said, the people have
a right to know.

380
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,779
And unlike you, Mr. Kent...

381
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:09,358
...I am willing to kill
for what I believe in.

382
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,310
Clark.

383
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:33,044
- Mr. Kent, are you okay?
- Yeah.

384
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,679
Son.

385
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,720
You've gotta help me.

386
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,932
Clark, are you okay?

387
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,265
I'll survive.

388
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:15,621
Your dad's got a cracked rib,
but he'll be all right.

389
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:18,284
Well, like you said, he's a survivor.

390
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:21,432
And so are you. I never realized
how strong you were until today.

391
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,328
Thanks, Clark, but I was terrified.

392
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,470
You didn't show it.
You were like super mom.

393
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,365
Dad, how you feeling?

394
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:29,972
Thank you.

395
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:33,142
Kind of like a house fell on me.
That's how I feel.

396
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:38,842
- Dad, I'm glad that you didn't, you know...
- What, kill Nixon?

397
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:44,619
I have to admit, it was the hardest thing I
ever did, took every fiber of my being.

398
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:49,055
But I started thinking about you and what
your Mom and I've tried to teach you.

399
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:52,560
I realized if I had done that,
Nixon would have won.

400
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,789
It's a good thing Lex was there.

401
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,665
Clark.

402
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:02,530
Nixon told me that Lex offered
to pay him for information on us.

403
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:06,508
Lex told me he warned Nixon
to stay away.

404
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,306
One of them is lying, son.

405
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:17,184
The question you need to ask yourself is,
which one tried to kill you...

406
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,653
...and which one saved your life?

407
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,789
If I have any more questions,
I'll give you a call.

408
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:28,728
- Thanks. Mr. Kent.
- Lex.

409
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,963
- Look...
- Lex...

410
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:41,074
You saved my life,
and I want to say thank you.

411
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,885
To a fresh start.

412
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:55,352
Yeah.

413
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,588
Clark.

414
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,661
Your mom told me what happened
with you and Lana in the tornado.

415
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,855
The only person who was there,
and I can't even share it with her.

416
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:11,297
Well, son, I'm here, you can share it
with me if you want.

417
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:16,633
Dad, I've survived a lot.

418
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,505
Being inside that twister...

419
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,975
I've never been so scared in my life.

420
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:25,877
I couldn't see anything. Things were
bouncing off me. I didn't have any control.

421
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:29,515
It could've been the wind,
but I moved toward the truck...

422
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,656
...and it felt like I was willing myself
to do it.

423
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,352
It felt like I was flying.

424
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,729
Lex.

425
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,434
Lex.

426
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:54,942
Dad?

427
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:58,672
Dad.

428
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,441
How are you?

429
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:03,185
The doctors won't tell me
what's going on.

430
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:07,586
I know. I wanted to tell you myself.

431
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:12,819
There's every chance
I'm gonna get back...

432
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,232
...the full use of my legs.

433
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:20,194
Well, that's great news. Isn't it?

434
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:24,068
I need to say something to you.

435
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:28,341
If I've acted ruthlessly...

436
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:33,415
...it was because I knew my opponents
wouldn't hesitate to do the same.

437
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:38,688
I know you've always seen us
as opponents.

438
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:43,121
Lex, when I needed help...

439
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:48,227
...you saved my life.

440
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:51,766
And I thank you, son.

441
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,562
Listen.

442
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:59,509
I know you agreed to go right ahead...

443
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:03,613
...right away, to operate.

444
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:09,152
- I thought it best to take immediate action.
- I would have done the same thing.

445
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,254
And we both...

446
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,058
...would have been wrong.

447
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,456
What are you saying?

448
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:27,601
I'm blind.

449
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,240
The operation failed.

450
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,535
And that's not going to change.

451
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,373
It would have been better
if you had not helped me.

452
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:39,607
If you'd let me...

453
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,714
...die.

454
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,349
Lex?

455
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,060
Lex.

456
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,227
Lex.

457
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,637
What are you doing, Clark?

458
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,210
- Thinking.
- Looks like you're hiding.

459
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:16,585
I just can't wait for things
to get back to normal.

460
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,289
It won't.

461
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,419
Why do you say that?

462
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:24,459
Nell used to tell me that
after the meteor shower.

463
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,891
But these events change you.

464
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:31,364
Wipes out your illusions.
You discover things about yourself.

465
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,628
What'd you discover?

466
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,405
I've always had this sense
that I was going to die young.

467
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:41,476
Maybe because of my parents.
Felt guilty I'd survived.

468
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,517
When the tornado came,
I thought...

469
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,015
...this was it, fate had finally found me.

470
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:56,721
Then I saw you in the truck...

471
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:01,422
...and you put your arms around me and
told me everything was going to be okay.

472
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,400
I know, it sounds crazy.

473
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:09,369
But I started to think of all the other
times you've been there to protect me.

474
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,202
I thought, "Maybe there's more
to Clark Kent than meets the eye."

475
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,855
You're right. It does sound crazy.

476
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,917
There's nothing more to me
than what you see.

477
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,360
Clark.

478
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,765
You know you can tell me anything, right?

479
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:42,028
I know, Lana.
But I wasn't in that truck.

480
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:45,831
Then how did I survive?
It doesn't make any sense.

481
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,144
Maybe you just weren't meant
to die young.

482
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,285
Just remember:

483
00:40:57,321 --> 00:41:00,222
You can't hide out here forever.
