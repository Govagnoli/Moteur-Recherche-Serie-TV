1
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,362
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

2
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,624
So far, but they're calling
for storms later.

3
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,701
Well, you know the heartland,
some things can change in a minute.

4
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,839
-Is everyone assembled?
-Twenty-four hours isn't a lot of notice.

5
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,804
Will you give me a heads-up
as to the nature of your remarks?

6
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:46,434
Just one of my customary motivational
speeches you've heard hundreds of times.

7
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,706
-How are you? Good to see you.
-How you doing?

8
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,817
-Good morning. Good to see you.
-Good morning.

9
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,078
-Good morning. Good to see you.
-Thank you.

10
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,653
Fire up the troops!

11
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,019
The plant made a profit this quarter
for the first time in two years.

12
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,252
My people are expecting a pat on the back,
and they deserve to get it.

13
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,023
I'll try not to disappoint them.

14
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,660
Thank you.

15
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,328
Thank you.

16
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,532
As most of you know...

17
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,509
...you've all worked extremely hard
this past year...

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,979
...and you should all be proud
of yourselves.

19
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,583
Just as a ship can only follow
the course...

20
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,922
...set by its captain...

21
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,397
...any business is only
as good as its leadership.

22
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:46,060
Due to management failures
beyond your control...

23
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,766
...this plant will be closing...

24
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,869
...effective immediately.

25
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,046
Good luck to all of you.

26
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,719
You just fired 2500 people
and blamed it on me.

27
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,550
One day you'll thank me.
Smallville isn't in your future.

28
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,522
-It's just a brief chapter in your biography.
-Don't do this.

29
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:11,130
We live in a meritocracy, Lex.
The weak get left behind.

30
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,322
The plant wasn't producing.
I had no other options.

31
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,491
Spare me the corporate barbarian spiel.

32
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,364
Those people have husbands and wives,
children, mortgages.

33
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,768
We're in business to make profits,
not friends!

34
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,636
Don't let your emotions get in the way
of making tough decisions!

35
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,404
Don't lecture me about letting
emotions get in the way.

36
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,069
This plant was showing a profit.

37
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,615
You're shutting it down because
I wouldn't go work for you in Metropolis.

38
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:36,244
Lex, you may have felt that you found
a home here, but you were mistaken.

39
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:40,017
This was just your training ground.
Well, your training is over!

40
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,931
You're coming home, son!

41
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,568
Pete, I need your opinion.
Classic black or traditional red?

42
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,830
For what?

43
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,702
My tie-cummerbund combo.
I gotta get my tux order in today.

44
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,275
If I were you, I'd stick
with the traditional black.

45
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,777
-This is no time to get adventurous.
-You're right.

46
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:11,007
I don't know, Clark.
Red always looks good on you.

47
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,173
Then red it is.

48
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,082
Thanks. Now I gotta go make a call
and change my order.

49
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,519
I don't want people mistaking us for twins.

50
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,420
Yeah, because that happens all the time.

51
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,892
You seem really excited about the dance.

52
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:27,021
I am, but between the tickets, the tux
and buying the flowers, it gets expensive.

53
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,929
You should try finding the right dress.

54
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,433
Guess the limo's out.

55
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,265
I'm actually thinking of asking Lex
if I can borrow his.

56
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,374
Chloe says she doesn't care,
but deep down I know she wants one.

57
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,533
I'm trying to surprise her,
so keep it between us.

58
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,702
My lips are sealed.

59
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,381
Chloe?

60
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,074
They're closing the LuthorCorp plant.

61
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,720
-So you heard.
-<i>The Ledger</i> rushed a special edition.

62
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,890
They haven't done that
since the meteor shower.

63
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,127
I talked to Chloe. She's pretty upset.

64
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,135
I spoke to her father. He's in shock.

65
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,570
I don't blame him.

66
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:12,537
-How's this gonna affect us?
-That plant was Smallville's biggest employer.

67
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,703
Shutting it down
is gonna have a domino effect.

68
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,078
I can't believe Lex would run it
into the ground in less than a year.

69
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,742
Why are you blaming Lex?
His dad closed the plant.

70
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,084
Whatever issues Lionel Luthor has with his
son have now cost half the town their jobs.

71
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,921
You should be happy, then. It means Lex is
going back to Metropolis and out of our lives.

72
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,655
The plant closing is gonna hurt
a lot of people, Clark.

73
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:36,495
As much as I would like Lex out of our
lives, I wouldn't wish that on anybody.

74
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:42,435
I know, Dad. It's just....
Lex cares about the town.

75
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,269
He said he had big plans.

76
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,607
The road to hell is paved
with good intentions.

77
00:05:56,122 --> 00:06:00,183
Okay. Turn. We're almost there.

78
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,952
All right.

79
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,289
-Okay.
-Stop.

80
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,192
Open your eyes.

81
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,568
Wow!

82
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,831
Why are you being so mysterious?

83
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:16,702
-Can't a guy plan a picnic for his girlfriend?
-I'm not complaining.

84
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,969
It's just kind of spontaneous.

85
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,113
Are you saying I'm usually boring?

86
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,876
I'm saying this is very nice.
I'm just wondering what the occasion is.

87
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,646
It's to thank you for everything.

88
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,722
It's been a difficult year,
and you've stood by me.

89
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,793
I pushed you away, and you could
have made other choices. You didn't.

90
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:41,559
We've been together a long time.
I'd never abandon you when you needed me.

91
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,064
There's something I want to tell you.

92
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:53,506
Whitney, you know, maybe we should--

93
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,040
-What's this?
-Read it.

94
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,554
United States Marine Corps?

95
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,689
I enlisted.

96
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,063
I think it's the right thing for me to do.

97
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,930
When I found my dad's medals, I felt
he was telling me which path I should take.

98
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,731
-You can't do this for your father.
-I'm not. I'm doing it for us.

99
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,568
Please, don't be mad.

100
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,279
It's just so fast, you know?

101
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,545
I need some time to process it.

102
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,556
I don't have a lot of time.

103
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,791
I ship out for basic training Saturday night.

104
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,629
What about graduation?

105
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,768
The only thing I'm gonna miss
in Smallville is you.

106
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,665
Will you wait for me?

107
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:15,755
Clark, I got your messages,
but I've been having a bad day.

108
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,996
Nice paperweight.

109
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,164
Yeah, very unique.

110
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,666
Sure you can afford being seen
with the town pariah?

111
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,430
I'll take my chances.

112
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,133
What happened, Lex?

113
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,106
The two theories seem to be...

114
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,940
...I either ran the plant into the ground
through incompetence...

115
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,344
...or did it deliberately to go back
to Metropolis.

116
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,680
Your dad already offered you a job
in Metropolis. Just tell people the truth.

117
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,117
Then I get stuck
with the incompetence rap.

118
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,950
Being reviled is the lesser evil.

119
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,184
I guess you're going back
to Metropolis, then.

120
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:52,457
That's why my father orchestrated
his coup, but this isn't over.

121
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,465
-You have a plan?
-Maybe.

122
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,697
You have a lot of work to do.

123
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:07,006
Clark, thanks for stopping by.
It means a lot.

124
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,703
What are friends for?

125
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,063
Thought I'd find you here.

126
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,997
My dad and I can't really do
the whole depressed thing together, so....

127
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,830
If you're not up for Saturday night,
I'd understand.

128
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:35,906
You kidding me? It's the only thing
I have to look forward to right now.

129
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:40,739
Besides, I want to enjoy all the quaint
Smallville High customs while I still can.

130
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,608
Why? Where are you going?

131
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:46,115
My dad's talking about moving
us back to Metropolis permanently.

132
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,587
What about the <i>Torch</i> and all your friends?

133
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,253
I can't even think about it right now.

134
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,254
Clark, I'm not exactly psyched
about having to fight my way...

135
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,795
...through the high school hierarchy
all over again.

136
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,693
You're gonna miss me, right?

137
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,236
Do you even have to ask?

138
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,373
Just promise me Saturday night's
gonna be great.

139
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,941
It'll be a night you won't forget.

140
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,050
I appreciate you coming.

141
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,055
My father doesn't know about this meeting,
and I'd like to keep it that way.

142
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,850
When I first came here...

143
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,153
...people assumed I was just another
glaring example of nepotism...

144
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,558
...unskilled and promoted over the heads
of the more competent and deserving.

145
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,394
But I'd like to think the people
in this room feel differently.

146
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,968
If we can raise the capital
for an employee-led buyout...

147
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,735
-...we can keep the plant running.
-Buyout?

148
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,807
I can raise nearly 90%% of the capital.

149
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,937
What about the rest?
We're supposed to mortgage our houses?

150
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,808
It's a risk, I know.

151
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,506
But in exchange, the investors
will become minority owners.

152
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:55,313
Doesn't your father control the board?
Why would he go along with a buyout?

153
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:59,754
I know a couple of members I can convince,
and I don't need a unanimous decision.

154
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:03,588
I'm offering you the chance
to take control of your own destiny.

155
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,596
Stand with me, and we'll win.

156
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,709
Clark.

157
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,785
Out wandering the streets of Smallville?

158
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,615
What is it?

159
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:38,290
I just found out that Chloe
might be leaving for good.

160
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,797
Not sure I really believe it's true.

161
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,693
I know what you mean.

162
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,371
You do?

163
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,638
Whitney's going off to join the Marines.

164
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,678
That's intense.

165
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,874
He told me he was doing it for us.

166
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,875
Asked if I'd wait for him.

167
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,015
Really? What did you say?

168
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,858
Nothing.

169
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,989
I kind of just stood there
in stunned silence.

170
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,328
One day he's worried
about his English paper...

171
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:21,666
...and the next, he's putting on
a uniform and saving the world.

172
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,999
So you didn't commit?

173
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,042
I told him I wasn't sure.

174
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,679
When does he head out?

175
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,584
Saturday night.

176
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,526
Guess you don't have to worry
about your dress.

177
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,535
I can't believe both Whitney and Chloe
are gonna be out of our lives.

178
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,704
Me neither.

179
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,273
Guess we get left behind, Clark.

180
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,527
What do you think caused the explosion?

181
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,686
Son, my guess is it was a leaky fuel line.

182
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,664
The fumes must have ignited the fertilizer
in the truck. I should have checked it better.

183
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,769
-I'm glad it was me and not one of you guys.
-Oh, sweetheart.

184
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,269
The truth is,
I barely felt the heat this time.

185
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,268
And the debris didn't leave any bruises.

186
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:43,312
As you get older,
your body must be getting stronger.

187
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,967
You're not in a hurry to pack?

188
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,161
That's because I'm not leaving.

189
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:10,968
Accept your fate, Lex.
It's time to move on.

190
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:15,876
I'm forcing a vote of the board of directors
to accept an employee buyout of the plant.

191
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:20,318
What are you gonna do? Convince the
employees to take out a second mortgage?

192
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:24,083
-Cash in their IRAs.
-Something like that.

193
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,885
Even if you sell all your stock
and drain your trust fund...

194
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,124
...you still come up short, Lex.

195
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,521
What will you do about
the rest of the money?

196
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,394
Take the buyout now,
and you can keep your dignity.

197
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:39,594
-That's more than you left me.
-That's very gracious of you, son.

198
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:44,038
You might wanna look at this first.

199
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,411
You've bought
the Smallville Savings and Loan.

200
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:57,681
Go ahead, lead your buyout. But remember,
I own your employees' mortgages.

201
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,120
As soon as they begin missing payments...

202
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,420
...I won't hesitate to foreclose
on each and every one of them.

203
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:07,463
They'll be homeless,
and it will be your fault.

204
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,566
You ready to accept
that kind of responsibility?

205
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,728
If you're going to take me on, son...

206
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:18,468
...you're gonna have to bring your game up
to a whole different level.

207
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,910
-Where have you been?
-I went to pick up my dress.

208
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,605
-We have a problem.
-You can't go.

209
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:27,274
I just can't pick you up. My transportation
kind of went up in flames.

210
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,581
I was gonna ask Lex if I could borrow
his limo, but with the plant--

211
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,317
-Clark, I'll drive.
-Ruins the whole Prince Charming vibe.

212
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,256
Cinderella was never my role model.

213
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:40,421
-Why the Marines?
-I don't know. It's just something I gotta do.

214
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,429
-So Whitney's off to fight evil for Uncle Sam.
-I heard.

215
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:47,538
That technically makes Lana a free agent.

216
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,936
He asked her to wait for him.

217
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,240
Long-distance relationships never work.

218
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:56,871
People change, have different experiences.
It's kind of like us, you know?

219
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,449
After a couple of weeks,
you'll forget all about me.

220
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,044
Chloe!

221
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,850
Okay, I just have this horrible nightmare...

222
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,619
...that you'll rush to the bus station
after Whitney leaves...

223
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,286
...and profess your undying love for Lana,
and I'll be waiting at the gym alone.

224
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,194
If you do that to me, Clark,
I'll never speak to you again.

225
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,267
Okay, I said it.

226
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,031
Chloe.

227
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:32,307
I'm going to the dance with you
not by default, but because I want to.

228
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,785
All right, I feel better now.

229
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,824
If I could just have one minute
of your time, Clark.

230
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,897
-How do you know my name?
-Roger Nixon.

231
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,628
I'm a journalist with the <i>Inquisitor</i>,
and I would like to write a story about you.

232
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,335
Thanks, but I'm really not interested.

233
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,066
Why weren't you hurt in that explosion?

234
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,405
You were in the truck on the farm.

235
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,013
I was nowhere near that truck.

236
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,846
Am I missing something interesting?

237
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,610
Lex?

238
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:13,148
You know my name,
but I don't know yours.

239
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,656
Roger Nixon. I work for the <i>Inquisitor.</i>

240
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:20,060
When is someone gonna put that bad
excuse for a tabloid out of its misery?

241
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,229
It was nice meeting you, Lex.

242
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,864
I'm sure we'll talk again soon, Clark.

243
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,536
What was that all about?

244
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,649
He wants to do a story on me,
make me out to be some kind of hero.

245
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,546
The <i>Inquisitor</i>'s a rag, Clark.

246
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,449
If I were you,
I wouldn't get mixed up with him.

247
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,920
I don't intend to.

248
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:51,385
If he gives you any more trouble,
let me know.

249
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,303
Hi, son.

250
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,076
Something wrong?

251
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,844
A journalist from the <i>Inquisitor</i>
wants to do a story on me.

252
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,249
He knows I was in the truck.

253
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:21,586
I don't think it was an accident.
I think he set it up to test me.

254
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,455
How did he know you would survive?

255
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,655
He must have seen me
do something before.

256
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,995
Look, I swear, ever since Phelan,
I've been so careful.

257
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,263
Clark, it's not your fault.

258
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,939
-But what do I do?
-Carry on, go to school, go to the dance...

259
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,878
...and if this reporter's really got something,
I'm sure he'll come talk to us.

260
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,791
What else?

261
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,290
I think Lex has a piece of the spaceship.

262
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,459
Are you sure?

263
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,627
I saw it on his desk. It's the missing piece.

264
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,464
<i>He must have found it in the field.</i>

265
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,266
<i>I don't know if he suspects anything,</i>
<i>but who knows what he'll do?</i>

266
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,877
-We all know how persistent Lex can be--
-He can't trace it to us.

267
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,980
Your mother's right, son.
We'll just keep our heads low.

268
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,446
So when you do your chores,
don't use your abilities.

269
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,744
<i>Whatever you do,</i>
<i>stay away from that storm cellar.</i>

270
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,402
You wanted to see me, Lex?

271
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,940
I'm surprised
you even remembered my name.

272
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,335
I warned you to stay away from the Kents.

273
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,742
Let me guess.
This is where you remind me...

274
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,577
...of all the terrible things
you can have done to me.

275
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,243
As I'm sure you're well aware,
I'm a little preoccupied at the moment.

276
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,685
I don't have time to deal
with your annoyances.

277
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:02,850
Well, what I have discovered
is beyond you and your problems...

278
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,360
...and your threats.

279
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,328
This newfound self-assurance
doesn't suit you, Roger.

280
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,163
Be nice, Lex, or I may not let you bid
on my discovery.

281
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,929
And I know you'll want to...

282
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:18,941
...especially when you consider all your
interest in the crash site and the Kents.

283
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,410
What was found out there has nothing
to do with the Kents or with you.

284
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:23,809
Are you certain?

285
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,085
Roger, for all your bravado,
you have yet to show me anything.

286
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:30,881
I'll show you all the evidence
you need tonight.

287
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,614
And you'll see for yourself.

288
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:37,228
There's a whole lot more to your friend
Clark Kent than meets the eye.

289
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:44,396
-I swear, if you harass Clark or his parents--
-Who said anything about harassment?

290
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:48,335
Maybe I'll just tell them the truth,
that you turned me on to them.

291
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,169
And if you're not interested in what I have,
I know of another Luthor who will be.

292
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,412
You are playing a very dangerous game.

293
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,143
You'd better pray you're not wrong.

294
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:11,255
Mom, can you give me a hand with this?

295
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,661
Who's there?

296
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,767
It's me, Clark. Are you all right?

297
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,768
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Really? You seem a little tense.

298
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,997
It's just the dance and everything.

299
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,766
Come here.

300
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:27,503
I'm sure I've tied more of these
than your mother.

301
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,280
Thought you were holed up
in the mansion.

302
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,782
Well, I needed to clear my head.
Took a drive, ended up here.

303
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,079
I didn't mean to bother you
on your big day.

304
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,779
I got a little time. Chloe's picking me up.

305
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,949
That's very progressive.
What happened to the truck?

306
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:45,187
A farming accident. You know how it is.

307
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,198
So how goes the bailout?

308
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:52,030
I'm not sure, Clark. I think it's
gonna get ugly before it gets better.

309
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,502
My father's dead set
against me succeeding.

310
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,036
Why would your father be
against the plant?

311
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,871
We have a complicated relationship, Clark.

312
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,481
My father wants me to believe
it's built on trust, but it's not.

313
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,548
It's built on lies and deceit.

314
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,153
Any relationship with that foundation
is destined to fail.

315
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,984
-Lucky we don't have that problem.
-Lucky us.

316
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,393
I want you to know whatever happens
in the next few days...

317
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,655
...I'm still your friend,
and that's never gonna change.

318
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:23,494
-I hope you feel the same way.
-I do.

319
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,727
What do you think's gonna happen?

320
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,840
I don't know. Just got a bad feeling...

321
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,670
...like when you can smell
the air change before a storm.

322
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,074
Storms are a way of life around here, Lex.

323
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,011
The trick is to not get caught
out in the open.

324
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,515
Look after yourself.

325
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:53,089
It's hard to believe. I thought
my whole life was in that trophy case.

326
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,756
Now it all seems so trivial.

327
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,534
We should get you to the bus station.

328
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,935
My bus doesn't leave for an hour.

329
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,106
How about we go check out the gym?

330
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,280
Okay.

331
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,724
It's beautiful.

332
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,234
Where is everyone?

333
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:34,065
Hour before the dance, the setup
committee goes home to get ready.

334
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,252
You're missing the spring formal
because of me.

335
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:03,097
We still have time for one last dance.

336
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,351
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before I enlisted.

337
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,449
I think you're very brave.

338
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:38,296
I know this is kind of sudden,
and you're not sure how you feel about us--

339
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,531
Whitney, let's just dance.

340
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,742
Hi.

341
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,044
What do you think? Too pink?

342
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,553
No. You--
You look beautiful.

343
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,916
Thank you. You clean up nicely yourself.

344
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,751
What happened to the red tie?

345
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,221
Instinct told me it was
the wrong way to go.

346
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:44,058
-Is that for me?
-Oh, yeah.

347
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,927
Oh, wow!

348
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,596
It's beautiful.

349
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,436
Oh, I have yours!

350
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,704
Okay.

351
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,275
Oh, did I get you?

352
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,217
We should go.

353
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,363
Yeah. Well, here we go.

354
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,398
-I'll get the door.
-Okay.

355
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:20,128
-Thanks. Looks like a storm's coming.
-Yeah.

356
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,005
-In?
-In.

357
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,156
-This is crazy!
-I know.

358
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,824
-You okay?
-Let's go.

359
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,266
Let's get inside!

360
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,572
Wow, you guys look great.

361
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:01,678
Well, thank you, Ms. Rivers.
It's faux Wang.

362
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,336
-Hi.
-Hi, Erica.

363
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,779
Hey, Chloe, could you--?

364
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,783
-He wants you to take our picture.
-Oh, yeah, sure.

365
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:13,287
I'll just be a sec. I think he wants proof
that this night actually happened.

366
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:19,028
-Well, I guess this is it.
-Good luck, Whitney.

367
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,727
Lana, can I have a minute alone
with Clark?

368
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:26,029
Sure. I'll bring the truck around.

369
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,600
Thanks.

370
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,472
You and I have had a weird year.

371
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,815
I started out thinking
you just wanted to steal Lana.

372
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,987
I'm not trying to make excuses,
but I did some things I'm not proud of.

373
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,456
I'm sorry, Clark.

374
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,154
I appreciate that.

375
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:59,167
Listen, Clark, there's something
I wanna ask you, a favor.

376
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,904
Okay.

377
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:06,339
Lana's not sure how she feels
about our relationship right now.

378
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,342
But I am.

379
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,041
I need you to look after her
until I get back.

380
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,882
I really don't know what to say.

381
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,319
Say yes.

382
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,219
Okay.

383
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,419
Clark?

384
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,692
I promise.

385
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,106
Thanks.

386
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,712
Good luck.

387
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:02,722
What was that all about?

388
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:06,393
Just guy stuff. Have I told you how
beautiful you look tonight?

389
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:10,735
Yeah, but frequent reminders
are always appreciated.

390
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,653
Do you have everything?

391
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:31,453
-You're only allowed one bag.
-I'd never make it as a Marine.

392
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,297
I want you to have this for luck.

393
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,010
I won't lose it this time.

394
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,189
Goodbye, Lana.

395
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,834
I loved you the first moment
that I saw you.

396
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:51,505
I'll still love you when I see you again.

397
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,143
Oh, Roger.

398
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,747
Baby...

399
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,322
...you are going to be filthy rich!

400
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,610
-Hey.
-Hey, Chloe's having a great time.

401
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,615
-I promised her a night she'd never forget.
-I'm glad you finally stepped up.

402
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,619
Yeah, me too.

403
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:50,222
-Hey, I like these guys.
-Yeah. Remy Zero!

404
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,783
I love this song.

405
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:21,390
-This is one of Chloe's favorite songs.
-Why do you think I requested it?

406
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,588
Now, that's what I'm talking about!

407
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,998
-May I have this dance?
-Of course.

408
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,764
The animals are all put away!
There's nothing more we can do here!

409
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,341
-We gotta get to the storm cellar!
-What about Clark?

410
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,970
The school's on the other side of town!
He'll be fine!

411
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,366
Mr. Kent!

412
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,035
-Who the hell are you?
-Roger Nixon, <i>Metropolis In</i>--

413
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,307
You're the reporter who threatened Clark!

414
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:01,042
-Don't do anything!
-Why not? He tried to kill our son.

415
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,017
-Did you blow up that truck?
-I knew it wouldn't hurt him.

416
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,314
No, please!

417
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,548
-Who sent you? Lex Luthor?!
-Jonathan, please!

418
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,193
-Was it Lex Luthor?!
-I don't need Lex Luthor.

419
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:14,422
-I'll tell the entire world about your son!
-You will not!

420
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,234
No! Jon--

421
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,892
Get up, come on!

422
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,437
Jonathan, look!

423
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,742
Jonathan, the tornado!

424
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,683
But he knows everything!

425
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:41,586
-I will not let him destroy this family!
-No! Please!

426
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,487
Jonathan!

427
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:32,865
Clark Kent, man of mystery. Just when I
think I have you figured out, you surprise me.

428
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:38,172
-How's that?
-The song, the tux...

429
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,408
...tonight.

430
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:45,419
-And I'm still here.
-Yeah, you are.

431
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,838
Stop the music, please.
Excuse me for a second.

432
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,679
Can I have everyone's attention, please?
Thank you.

433
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,783
The National Weather Service
has just issued a tornado warning.

434
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,511
Three funnels were spotted
heading towards Smallville.

435
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,084
Now, please, everyone, stay calm.

436
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:22,783
The twisters are gonna set down
south of here, but for your own safety...

437
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,951
...no one will be allowed
to leave the gym.

438
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:27,563
The bus station's south of town.
Lana's there.

439
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,597
Don't worry. I'm sure she's home by now.

440
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:33,294
You know what? I'll go call her
on my cell, and you wait here.

441
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,638
Clark?

442
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,037
Clark?

443
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,616
Damn you, Nixon!

444
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:00,227
So you're using your mother's stock
to fund the buyout.

445
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,831
That's your secret source.

446
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:05,594
I must admit, it's a bold move, Lex,
but it won't work.

447
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,739
-You braved the weather to tell me that?
-It's suicide, Lex.

448
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:12,740
You may get the plant, but you're putting
your employees' homes on the line.

449
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,400
Forfeiting your own future.

450
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,639
Or forging a new destiny free from you.

451
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,215
You're not my enemy. You're my son.

452
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,688
I never saw the distinction.

453
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,484
When Alexander the Great was dying,
his generals asked...

454
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,684
...who he would leave his empire to...

455
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:35,924
...if he would appoint a successor
who would keep the legacy intact...

456
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,762
...prevent generations of bloodshed.

457
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,336
His answer was simple:
"I leave it to the strongest."

458
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:44,770
I believe the term is,
"Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war."

459
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:48,378
I'll bury you and everyone in Smallville
who takes your side.

460
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:07,955
No!

461
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:17,362
Lex!

462
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,275
Lex!

463
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,272
Lex!

464
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,140
Help me, Lex!

465
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,376
Lex!

466
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,087
Can't move!

467
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,889
Help me!

468
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,096
Lex!

469
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:48,300
Son, please!

470
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,590
Damn it!

471
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,541
Clark!

472
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,807
Lana!

473
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,847
Clark!

474
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,918
No!

475
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,129
