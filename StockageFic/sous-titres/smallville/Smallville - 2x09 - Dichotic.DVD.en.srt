1
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:15,044
An S.

2
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:17,613
How exactly did you come up
with this, Clark?

3
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:19,045
It's for Smallville High.

4
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,653
Thought the school logo
could use an update.

5
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:24,187
Your form could use a little function.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,521
I told you. Stick with the basics.

7
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,564
You can't miss with a candlestick holder.

8
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,195
You call this a letter opener?

9
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:42,865
Poorly cast, shoddy workmanship.
I expected better from you, lan.

10
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,136
You're not gonna
grade me down, are you?

11
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:48,580
I'm gonna give you the grade you deserve.

12
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,114
But I did the work.
I came to every class.

13
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:55,583
Attendance isn't everything.
There's also attitude and effort.

14
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,892
That's it. Good work, most of you.

15
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:09,259
Grades will be posted Thursday.

16
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,570
Clark, how about a sneak preview?

17
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,643
Come on, man. I'm not gonna tell your dad.

18
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:38,125
So? Come on, man.
Don't keep me in suspense. How'd I do?

19
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,463
You were smart to stick to the basics.

20
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,977
What's bugging him?

21
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:56,844
Let's just say that lan's legendary 4.0
took a hit. I saw his grade.

22
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,747
His name's right above yours
in Frankel's book.

23
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,615
That's too bad. Kid's an academic dynamo.

24
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,555
But keep loading up on night classes and
extracurriculars, something's gotta give.

25
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:07,954
Yeah.

26
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,400
Lan.

27
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,703
I need an A in this class.

28
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:29,307
Mr. Frankel, we need to talk
about my grade.

29
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:33,209
I told you, it'll be posted on Thursday.

30
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,378
No, I need to know now.

31
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,758
It's a C. And frankly, that was generous.

32
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:43,259
Wait, that's not fair. I work twice as hard
as anybody at this school...

33
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:47,331
...and I need a perfect 4.0 to lock down
the Luthor Foundation scholarship.

34
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:52,230
That grade is final, lan,
and this conversation is over.

35
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,742
Lan, what the hell is this?

36
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,913
I'm calling the police!

37
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,424
I just can't accept a C.

38
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,916
Yes, I'm aware I'm late.

39
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:20,389
Look, make my apologies to the EPA rep
and start the plant tour without me.

40
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,586
Yes, I still plan on being in Metropolis
for the charity auction.

41
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,254
Excuse me. I've been here
less than five minutes.

42
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,798
Too late. I've already started
writing the ticket.

43
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,835
I'm in a hurry, I have a headache,
I don't have time for this.

44
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,668
Yeah, wouldn't want you to miss
your tee time.

45
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,901
These are for a charity auction.

46
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,171
So you'll give away a $4000-dollar
set of golf clubs...

47
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,817
...but you'll gripe over a $25
parking ticket.

48
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,716
I'm sorry, have I done something
to offend you?

49
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,922
It's always the rich ones that put up a stink.

50
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,266
Some of us actually work for a living.

51
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,598
Watch where you park your car
in the future...

52
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,603
...Lex.

53
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,921
Hey!

54
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,650
Are you crazy?

55
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,820
I employ 2500 people in this town.

56
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:37,035
Who all pay taxes,
which provide your salary.

57
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,235
Get a real job.

58
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,976
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

59
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,751
- More?
- I know. Just a couple more boxes.

60
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,856
Thanks for letting me live with you,
Mr. Sullivan.

61
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,257
- It really, really means a lot.
- You're welcome.

62
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,488
In honor of the day,
I'm gonna make dinner.

63
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,362
- Oh, hey, don't put yourself out.
- Mi casa es su casserole.

64
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,767
- So how you feeling?
- Excited and terrified at the same time...

65
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,306
...if that makes any sense.

66
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,500
Well, it is a big change.

67
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,978
Huge, and not just for me.
Even though she agreed to it...

68
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,049
...Nell was kind of upset that I decided
to stay in Smallville.

69
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,521
It's not easy when someone you love
moves away.

70
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:44,068
So that looks like it's everything,
if you need to get your truck back.

71
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:48,535
I lucked out. My mom called and said
she was gonna take off early...

72
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,176
...help finish up the chores.
You wanna celebrate?

73
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,677
I wish I could, but I've gotta get changed
and take a shift at the Talon.

74
00:06:54,847 --> 00:07:00,183
I only have a second to grab a bite before
I need to run over to the Torch. Sorry.

75
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,319
Well, when you two are scheduled
to take a breath, give me a call.

76
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,390
- Will do.
- Thanks, Clark.

77
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,923
Yeah.

78
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,323
Bye.

79
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,390
This is gonna be so great.

80
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:33,909
Well, looks like it's just you and me,
old girl.

81
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,519
Come on.

82
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,465
Come on, you.

83
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:05,350
Mom? Dad?

84
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,247
Anyone home?

85
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,151
- Clark! Clark!
- Dad.

86
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,749
Dad?

87
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,829
I can't move my leg.

88
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,800
It's broken. Hold on.

89
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:39,081
Oh, sorry, the door was open. I'm lan.

90
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,480
Randall. Yeah, I know.

91
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,918
You practically own the library table
by the math and science shelves.

92
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,890
Yeah, and you've staked out carrel 17,
current events.

93
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,463
Guess we're both candidates for
the Overachievers Anonymous Club.

94
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:56,591
Yeah. So, what brings you to my
stressed-out part of the world?

95
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,733
Well, actually, I had heard that most
of the library's reference books...

96
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,034
...had migrated over to this side
of the building.

97
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,370
Oh, right. I've been meaning
to return these...

98
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,537
But just couldn't find the time.

99
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,877
Exactly. Days like this,
I could really use two of me.

100
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,144
Are you getting started early as well?

101
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:20,357
No, actually, I'm planning on graduating
at the end of this school year.

102
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,924
But you're only a sophomore.

103
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:26,929
Yeah, but I've been piling on night classes,
extra-credit work.

104
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,796
If I can land the Luthor Scholarship,
I'll be going Ivy League next year.

105
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,438
Color me journalistically intrigued.

106
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,479
How about an interview?

107
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,246
Okay. All right.

108
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,819
But take it easy on me.
Your reputation precedes you.

109
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:54,384
I have a feeling I'll be able to leave my
hard-hitting reporter hat at home this time...

110
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,028
...so don't worry.

111
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,997
Is he gonna be all right?

112
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,435
I don't see him square-dancing
in the near term...

113
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,098
...but if he stays off the leg,
he should heal fine.

114
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:14,507
- Oh, my God. Jonathan.
- Stop. Martha, I'm gonna be fine.

115
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:18,548
His doctor agrees. As soon as I can find you
a pair of crutches, you're good to go.

116
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,083
Thank you.

117
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,585
Where've you been?
I left a message an hour ago.

118
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,627
I was in a closed-door teleconference
between Lionel and the LuthorCorp board.

119
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,459
- I wish you'd waited for me.
- I did wait for you. I waited over an hour.

120
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,194
I'm sorry. I tried to call,
but the machine was on.

121
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,306
What's done is done. I would just really
like to get out of here. Now, please?

122
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,068
- I'll pack up your stuff.
- Okay.

123
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,942
I'm really sorry.

124
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,608
I know.

125
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,348
I'm looking for a Dr. Bryce.

126
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,988
You found her.

127
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,522
Yes, I'm a friend of Jonathan Kent's.

128
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,957
I've placed a call to my father's personal
orthopedist in Metropolis.

129
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,121
Any complications, he can be flown
out here within the hour.

130
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,465
A broken leg is nothing to sneeze at, but
there's no reason to summon the cavalry.

131
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:14,128
- I just want him to get the best care.
- So do I.

132
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,606
I've offended you.

133
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,980
I'm second-guessed for a living, Mr. Luthor.

134
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,616
It comes with the territory.

135
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,917
Lex, what's going on?

136
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:32,353
Mr. Luthor and I were just discussing
the state of small-town medicine.

137
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,490
- How's your dad?
- He's okay.

138
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:46,764
It's my mom I'm worried about.
She blames herself for the accident.

139
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:50,067
Well, your mom's taken on a lot
and she's trying to find a balance.

140
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,107
Believe me, it's not always that easy.

141
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,378
Guess I'm just lucky she didn't take
a 9-iron to a meter maid's car.

142
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,583
- You heard about that.
- The town is called Smallville.

143
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:09,490
- I was having a bad day.
- Yeah.

144
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,330
- I can do it. I can do it.
- Thank you.

145
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,470
Thank you. No, I'm fine.

146
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,206
- Oh, God. All right.
- Just take it easy.

147
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:30,945
So perfect attendance, straight A's and a
class load that would make Einstein crack.

148
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,278
Forget the interview. Let's just call Ripley's.

149
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:37,411
- It's kind of intense, huh?
- That's like saying the sun is kind of hot.

150
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,353
I think it's an only-child thing.

151
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,755
Part of me always wants to do
twice as much...

152
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,555
...make up for the children
my parents never had.

153
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,459
As an only myself, I understand.

154
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,226
Though I'll never get this mad rush
to graduate.

155
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:54,100
Well, I just know there's more to life than
Smallville. And I can't wait to take it on.

156
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,264
You and me both.

157
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,174
You are on a deadline, right?

158
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:05,010
Oh, yeah. One of the drawbacks
of actually enjoying yourself.

159
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,277
Time flies.

160
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,547
Well, you know, if you want,
maybe I could tag along.

161
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,658
We could do something
when you're through.

162
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,226
Great. Yeah, I would love that.

163
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,101
- Hey, Chloe.
- Hi, Clark.

164
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:29,273
You remember lan, the amazing lan.
We were just finishing up.

165
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,740
- Yeah, I'll grab the check.
- Okay, I'll grab the car.

166
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,544
Meet you outside in five.

167
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,751
Lan. Frankel gave you
a pretty hard time today, huh?

168
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,945
Yeah, well, his bark's worse than his bite.

169
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:47,058
I caught him in the hall after class,
he said I definitely nailed the A.

170
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,093
Really? That's good for you.

171
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,127
Thank God. I thought you'd
forgotten about our math session.

172
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,561
That's why I'm here.

173
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,827
With my dad out of commission,
I have to make the feed store run.

174
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,903
Okay. Yeah, I understand.

175
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,301
So. Simultaneous equations
giving you grief?

176
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,911
Higher math and I don't seem
to get along very well.

177
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,983
Yeah, I suffered through algebra last term.
If you want, I can give you a few tips.

178
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:16,679
Are you serious?
Because I am totally lost.

179
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,848
Yeah. Yeah, definitely.
When's a good time?

180
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,027
I'm off in 10 minutes.

181
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,628
Great.

182
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,762
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, thanks.

183
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,200
You okay, Clark?

184
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,906
Yep.

185
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,439
- I'd better go.
- All right.

186
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,078
Hey, lan. Hop in.

187
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,414
- Come on.
- Oh, great car.

188
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:01,117
- Thanks for the ride.
- No problem.

189
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:06,128
- Thanks, lan. You're a lifesaver.
- Trust me. There's no place I'd rather be.

190
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,498
Dad, aren't you supposed to be
taking it easy?

191
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,507
I am taking it easy.
I slept in till 6, didn't I?

192
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,669
Besides, I've gotta go out
and feed and water the cattle.

193
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,576
Done.

194
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,381
Really?

195
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,745
- Well, did you clean out the...
- Chicken coop?

196
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,085
Dad, I took care of it, don't worry.

197
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,722
Good morning.

198
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,590
Mom, you're not dressed for work.

199
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,824
I thought I would stay home today.
Just until things settle down.

200
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,198
Sweetheart, I don't want my accident
to disrupt this whole family.

201
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,965
Dad, the couch is over there.

202
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,836
Clark, believe me.
I can take it just as easy...

203
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,777
...greasing the bearings on the tractor out
in the barn as I can sitting on that couch.

204
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,893
Mom, you can't blame yourself
for Dad's accident.

205
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,055
This farm is supposed to be a partnership.

206
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,964
But ever since I've been working with
Lionel, I haven't been able to do my share.

207
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,402
You took that job to help the farm.

208
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,836
No one expects you to be in two places
at once.

209
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:26,205
No, but I should try to be where I'm needed.

210
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,920
How's that for weird?
Frankel's never even missed a class before.

211
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,252
Looks like the metal-shop impaired
caught a break today.

212
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,724
I'm glad you scoped out my grade.

213
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,126
Hey, check out Lana's new study buddy.

214
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,802
Yeah.

215
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,234
Do I detect a hint of the J-word?

216
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:58,740
- No, Lana and I are just friends.
- Right.

217
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,413
Thanks. I really appreciate this, Lana.

218
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,246
Your peer recommendation's gonna carry
a lot of weight with Lex Luthor.

219
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,857
Anyone who can help me with double-angle
functions deserves a scholarship.

220
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,003
Well, I'll talk to you later. Page me.

221
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:35,843
Looks like the study date went well.

222
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:41,714
Yeah, lan showed me this great shortcut
and after that, the study part was over.

223
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:47,058
Lan's really intense.
You know, in a good way.

224
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,319
We're getting together again tonight.

225
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,990
- More studying?
- Actually, we're gonna go see a movie.

226
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,034
- What does Chloe think?
- What do you mean?

227
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,433
You saw her and lan at the Talon last night.

228
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,666
- Yeah, they were doing an interview.
- No...

229
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,037
...they were gonna go on a date.

230
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:09,305
He bailed on her to help you
with your algebra homework.

231
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,281
Chloe and I were unpacking for an hour
last night, she didn't say a word.

232
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,783
Lana, I swear, they...

233
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:19,185
Listen, this move's been tough enough.
And Chloe and her dad have been great.

234
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:24,421
So please, if you don't have any facts,
just stay out of it.

235
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,919
Dr. Bryce?

236
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,517
Mr. Luthor.

237
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:02,222
- Like your nametag.
- It's my secret identity. Don't tell anyone.

238
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:07,095
Gotta admit, you are the last person
I expected to see here today.

239
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:13,301
- What are you here for?
- I drop-kicked an orderly.

240
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,843
I have a violent reaction to incompetence.

241
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:22,248
Drop-kick must have caught him off guard.

242
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:27,085
So, what'd you do?
Verbally demean your butler?

243
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:32,458
Cute. I took a 9-iron
to a meter maid's car.

244
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:38,900
Now I'm really jealous. I've always
wanted to do that. How'd it feel?

245
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,561
Great.

246
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,436
Word of advice,
keep that to yourself in here.

247
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:49,039
Wanna get together after class?
Grab something...

248
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:50,442
No.

249
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:54,211
- Got a thing about dating classmates?
- No, I've got a thing about dating you.

250
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,149
Why?

251
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,715
You don't remember me, do you?

252
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,986
If everyone could please take their seats...

253
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,535
- Chloe?
- Yeah.

254
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,769
- Got a second?
- Sure.

255
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:27,447
"Primed to graduate two years early,
lan Randall is a true academic superstar."

256
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,883
Well, so much for journalistic detachment.

257
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:33,718
Believe it or not, not every story
has to be Wall of Weird material.

258
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,588
Why am I defending myself?

259
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,094
Do you like him?

260
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:43,394
I don't not like him.
What is this about, Clark?

261
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,559
Nothing, I just want you to be careful.

262
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,602
Why?

263
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,066
Look, I probably shouldn't say anything...

264
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:54,702
...but I saw him and Lana in the hallway
and they seemed pretty close.

265
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,108
Oh, I get it.

266
00:21:56,281 --> 00:22:00,684
You just wanna make sure that poor little
Chloe doesn't get burned. Again.

267
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,717
- No. Chloe...
- You know what, Clark?

268
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:06,346
Not that it matters, but lan already
told me Lana was kind of into him...

269
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,321
...but he'd rather be with me.

270
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,985
He asked me to keep it a secret because
he doesn't wanna hurt her feelings.

271
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,692
And you believe that?

272
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:19,661
You really can't imagine that someone
would choose me over Lana, can you?

273
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,936
Chloe, wait...

274
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,548
lan, we need to talk.

275
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:41,523
- Later, Clark, I'm busy.
- Now. It's about Chloe and Lana.

276
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,752
I know you're playing them off each other.

277
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,556
Must have learned from the master.

278
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,060
What does that mean?

279
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:52,533
Chloe told me how you dumped her
the day after spring formal.

280
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:57,937
And Lana said you send off so many
mixed signals you could scramble a radar.

281
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:02,308
Maybe they'd rather be with a guy
who's going someplace.

282
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,541
You know, after I get my scholarship,
I am out of this hick town.

283
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,717
So you don't care about them at all,
do you?

284
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,081
You're using them to get your scholarship.

285
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,723
Chloe writes you the big article and
Lana gives you the fast track to Lex.

286
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,757
I never said that.

287
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,224
Why don't you just admit it.

288
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:21,890
The two girls who used to like you
now like me and you're jealous.

289
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:26,632
It's gonna be hard to keep your 4.0
when Frankel gave you a C.

290
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,367
I never saw any grades posted.

291
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:38,005
It's pretty weird, Frankel takes the day off.
Lucky break for you.

292
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,612
You trying to say something?

293
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,754
Guy took a sick day.

294
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,957
Stay out of my life, Kent.

295
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:00,494
Clark, for the record, this is messed up.
Mr. Frankel's sick.

296
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:06,110
I checked with Principal Reynolds' office.
He didn't call in sick. He didn't call at all.

297
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,406
This is the last place anyone saw Frankel.
I just wanna look around.

298
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,446
You wanna look around,
we'll look around.

299
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,584
But I don't know what
you think we'll find.

300
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,720
Gonna have a little look around.
There.

301
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,447
- Just take a look.
- I'm looking around.

302
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:22,059
You happy? We looked around.
There's nothing here.

303
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,495
What are you doing here?

304
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,238
What's it look like?

305
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:12,536
Chloe, he just tried to kill me and Pete.

306
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,702
And I think he murdered Frankel.

307
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,507
What is this, a joke?

308
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,650
Yeah, Clark. When did this
deadly encounter occur?

309
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,378
Twenty minutes ago. I came right over.

310
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:27,048
- Okay, stop, that's impossible.
- Why?

311
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:30,717
Because I've been here for the last
three hours, Clark.

312
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,145
Lana, have you seen Chloe?

313
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,753
She's at the sheriff station
giving her statement.

314
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,049
I don't remember ordering
a side of hostility.

315
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,292
I can't believe you accused lan
of murdering Mr. Frankel.

316
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:06,824
Lana, you have to believe me. I don't know
how he did it, but he's lying to everyone.

317
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,896
A boy with secrets. I'm surprised
you're not fast friends.

318
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,729
Don't try to turn this around on me.

319
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:15,498
He's seeing you and Chloe both.
He was at her house, she's his alibi.

320
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,904
Clark, they were finishing up an interview.

321
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:22,069
Does Chloe always finish up her interviews
by making out with her subjects?

322
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:26,909
Lan told me that Chloe had a little
crush on him but it wasn't serious.

323
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,248
And he told you not to say anything
to Chloe about it, didn't he?

324
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,754
Lana, he said the same thing
to Chloe about you.

325
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:41,296
If this is all because I enjoy spending time
with lan, then you are way overreacting.

326
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,457
I'd say you were jealous.

327
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,661
No, Lana, I'm trying to be your friend.

328
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,328
Look, you gotta ask yourself...

329
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:51,942
...what kind of person asks the two people
he cares about to lie for him?

330
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:13,329
Metropolis General. I was drunk,
puking my guts out in the ER.

331
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:17,059
You were the first-year med student
assigned to sober me up.

332
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:20,033
It's a night I'll never forget either.

333
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:24,932
- Guess I owe you a belated thank-you.
- Actually, I should be thanking you.

334
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,273
It's cases like yours that convinced me
to leave Metropolis.

335
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:35,647
I'm flattered I turned you from nose jobs
and liposuction to small-town medicine.

336
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,046
Your father is Stanley Bryce, right?

337
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,691
Plastic surgeon to the Metropolis
rich and famous?

338
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,793
Somebody's been doing his homework.

339
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,292
You intrigue me, Helen.

340
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:47,295
Suddenly we're on a first-name basis, Lex?

341
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,933
Don't worry, I won't give up
your secret identity.

342
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:54,197
For the record, I refused to join my father's
practice and we stopped speaking.

343
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,163
They hate when you do that.

344
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,140
Sounds like you speak from experience.

345
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,710
You witnessed my self-destructive phase.

346
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,873
Then I almost let my father die. Now I'm
just trying to beat him at his own game.

347
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:09,885
- How's that going?
- I terrorize meter maids.

348
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:16,324
Yeah. I drop-kick orderlies. It's funny,
I was never an angry child.

349
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:21,561
I'll see you in class.

350
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,333
I'm off in 10 minutes.

351
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:35,412
If you wanted to go do something.

352
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:48,288
Clark, I got your 911.
I assume we're back on the lan trail?

353
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,485
I got lan's scholarship information
from Lex.

354
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,290
He was taking classes
at Smallville Community College...

355
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,865
...at the exact same time he was
at Smallville High.

356
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,631
Any idea how an only child can make like
the Olsen twins?

357
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:02,739
"How" isn't important. I wanna make sure
we're right before throwing around charges.

358
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:06,900
Yeah, well, I wouldn't look for much help
in our Lana and Chloe department.

359
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,608
Maybe I can. Doesn't lan carry a pager?

360
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,755
- Hey, lan.
- Mr. Sullivan, hi.

361
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,760
- Is Chloe here?
- No, I'm afraid she's not home.

362
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,161
I don't understand. She paged me
to meet her here at 5:30.

363
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:32,963
Must be some kind of mix-up. Last I heard,
she was working late at the Torch.

364
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,639
- Okay, thanks.
- All right.

365
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:59,396
- Hey, Pete, have you seen Lana?
- Not for a while. Why?

366
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:03,022
Well, she paged me, said she wanted
to get together at 5:30.

367
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:06,693
What can I say?
Something must have come up.

368
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:15,477
Clark, Mr. Punctual made his appearance
at exactly 5:30.

369
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,945
Which means we're definitely
seeing double.

370
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:21,711
Thanks, Pete. I'll call Chloe.

371
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:34,331
God, Clark. Give it a rest.

372
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:39,131
Hey, lan, I will be with you
in just one second.

373
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,269
Lana, hi. Would you...

374
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:47,570
I thought that you were going home
after your shift was over.

375
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:49,676
We need to talk.

376
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,547
Okay, sure. About what?

377
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,477
About lan.

378
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:01,390
He's... Actually, he's stopping by
to look over his article.

379
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,995
Is that why you're wearing a new blouse?

380
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:10,061
Okay, this just got incredibly awkward.

381
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:15,031
Clark came by the Talon.
I know about you and lan.

382
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:20,339
For a guy so concerned with privacy,
he can't seem to keep his mouth shut.

383
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:24,003
This isn't about Clark. It's about us.

384
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,348
I hated keeping it from you...

385
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,956
...but I really like lan
and I didn't wanna hurt your feelings.

386
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:37,185
I don't wanna hurt your feelings either.
But I was out with lan last night too.

387
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:44,228
Making me 0 for 2 in the "they always
go for Lana" sweepstakes.

388
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,235
Chloe, he's playing us both.

389
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:53,372
And I should have been honest
with you up front.

390
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:55,273
Me too.

391
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,473
Hey.

392
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,277
Lan. What are you doing here?

393
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:06,946
Well, I was looking for you.
Both of you, actually.

394
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:11,092
The two-for-one special?
Lan, we know.

395
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,996
Well, can you blame me?

396
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:18,693
I mean, I enjoyed being with the two
smartest, prettiest girls in school.

397
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,895
Together, you're almost my equal.

398
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:28,072
I don't believe this.
Clark tried to warn us about you.

399
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,915
Kent.

400
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:35,543
Is that why you paged me at the same time?

401
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,951
What are you talking about?
I never paged you.

402
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,327
Lan, what are you doing?

403
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:48,965
Securing my future.

404
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:55,100
Your futures, on the other hand,
don't look so bright.

405
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,710
Hey, girls. How about a double date?

406
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,217
Chloe! Lana!

407
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:13,118
Chloe!
Clark, check this out.

408
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,486
"We've both been deceiving ourselves
over lan."

409
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,494
"Now the pain's too much. We've gone
to the dam to end our suffering."

410
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,097
Sounds like a suicide note.

411
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:23,495
Lan wanted me to see that.

412
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,569
He's gonna kill them to get to me.

413
00:33:56,934 --> 00:34:01,837
- Lan, don't. Please.
- I'm not gonna let you ruin my life.

414
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:08,736
- Lan, you need help.
- That's what I'm doing. Helping myself.

415
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,617
No!

416
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:19,421
Chloe!

417
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:31,759
- Hey, give me a hand here!
- Be there in a sec.

418
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,304
Come on.

419
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,235
Clark!

420
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,751
You okay?

421
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,957
You sure?

422
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:24,245
Clark, any word on Lana and Chloe?

423
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,280
They're shaken up, but okay.

424
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,509
They didn't see you use your abilities?

425
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,713
I think they were a little preoccupied
with the idea of two lans.

426
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,382
I thought we were done with bills
this month.

427
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,926
We were, but I thought
I'd take another look...

428
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,791
...and see if we could get along
without my extra paycheck.

429
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:45,595
I've been thinking that I've been trying
to do too many things.

430
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,171
- I really should stay on the farm.
- Look...

431
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,508
I was not angry because
you weren't here.

432
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,373
But I'm not gonna lie to you.

433
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:57,706
Ever since you took this job...

434
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:02,178
...things have been different between
you and me.

435
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,584
I don't want you to quit.

436
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:09,487
But you've gotta know that
it seems to me like sometimes...

437
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,060
...the Luthors take top priority.

438
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,026
I guess I've just gotta work through that.

439
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,901
I really like what I'm doing, Jonathan...

440
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,064
...but you and Clark will always come first.
You know that.

441
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,373
Yeah.

442
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:40,182
- Hey, Lana.
- Oh, hey.

443
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:43,850
- How you feeling?
- Still a little freaked.

444
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,791
Kind of stupid.

445
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:48,932
Ditto. What really gets me is
I should have known better.

446
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,537
Only Chloe Sullivan could fall for a guy
who splits himself in two.

447
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,296
I don't know. What is it about me?

448
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,998
Do I have a sign around my neck
that says "mutant magnet"?

449
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,608
He fooled me too, Chloe.

450
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,838
So much for our taste in guys.

451
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:08,481
It only went as far as it did because we
weren't being honest with each other.

452
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:12,589
- So no more secrets, okay?
- Okay.

453
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,692
I'm gonna finish the laundry because
I'm cooking dinner tonight.

454
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,761
- Lana, you don't have to do that.
- Oh, I don't mind.

455
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,329
You're not a glorified guest.
This is your house too...

456
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:25,060
...and we're not gonna kick you out
if there's evidence you actually live here.

457
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:28,797
I guess after my parents and Nell,
I've got a few abandonment issues.

458
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,373
I went through the same thing
when my mom walked out.

459
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,476
I was afraid my dad was
gonna leave too.

460
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:37,838
But he sat me down and said I didn't have
to earn the right to be part of this family.

461
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:39,346
Neither do you.

462
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:46,018
- Thanks, Chloe.
- Sure. Now, let's go over the house rules.

463
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,987
Okay, and they are?

464
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,957
One, do not make your bed
until after 5 p.m.

465
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:55,360
Two, don't touch the dishes in the sink
until it's overflowing.

466
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:58,866
And three, contrary to my dad's
protestations...

467
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:02,369
...your bedroom floor is definitely a closet.

468
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,731
- Okay.
- Okay?

469
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,988
Got your message.
Is everything all right?

470
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,084
We've been up all night talking.

471
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,726
And you were the number-one topic
of discussion.

472
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:26,524
This can't be good.

473
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:30,833
Actually, we wanted to apologize to you
for the way we've been treating you.

474
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,765
Even though you did technically
use us as bait.

475
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,307
I didn't count on it getting out of control.

476
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,842
The point is, you warned us about lan
and we didn't listen.

477
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,212
Yeah, you thought I was jealous.

478
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,282
There's a lot of water under the bridge
between us, Clark.

479
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,620
I know you each have issues with me,
but you have to understand that...

480
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,518
...I would never let anyone hurt you.

481
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,220
We know that, Clark.

482
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,489
I find it interesting you gave
lan all the latitude in the world...

483
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,859
...and I would just be
immediately dismissed.

484
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,534
After all the times you've been
less than honest...

485
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:09,138
...can you really blame us
for having some doubts?

486
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,399
You want honesty?

487
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:14,944
The truth is that I expected more
from both of you.

488
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,445
And we expected more from you.

489
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,086
We made a mistake.
But it was ours to make.

490
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,062
So, what do we do now?

491
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:40,169
Well, first we can stop treating me
like the jealous boyfriend.

492
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:42,805
Since none of us have actually dated.
