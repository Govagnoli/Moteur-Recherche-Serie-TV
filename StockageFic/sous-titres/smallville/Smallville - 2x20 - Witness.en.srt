1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,440
You're putting a lot of time into
this equestrian show.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,120
I didn't realize its importance.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,920
I'm inviting the Smalls to come watch me
ride in this weekend's competition.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,640
Oh. Well, I take it everything's good
on the father-daughter front.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,360
Actually, they're great.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,960
Well, this could actually work out, then.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,840
Let's just say I'm cautiously optimistic.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,680
I keep living my life
waiting for the other shoe to drop.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,000
You deserve to be happy.

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,320
Thanks, Clark.

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,400
Clark, what happened to you?

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,760
Story deadline...?

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,320
- Stop me when I'm getting warm.
- My article about the debate team.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,720
I'm really sorry.
I got caught up helping Lana.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,960
I'll get it to you first thing tomorrow.

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,400
Well, unfortunately, Clark,
I needed it tonight.

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,960
To fill in the hole, I had to blow up
the lunch menu to a 60-point type.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,520
- I'm sure that'll be fascinating.
- Chloe, it's my fault.

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,240
- I asked Clark to help me.
- No, Lana, I don't blame you.

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,400
Well, I'm gonna go lock up in the back.

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,560
- Thanks again for your help.
- Yeah.

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,360
Chloe, I'll make it up to you. I promise.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,480
I can't say that makes me feel any better,
given your track record on promises.

24
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,760
It's one story, what's the big deal?

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,920
That you couldn't give up
one riding practice to do.

26
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,680
- Don't make this about Lana.
- I'm not. This is about you.

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,840
And your perennial inability
to be there when I need you.

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,240
- Don't you think you're being harsh?
- No. I don't.

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,720
I'm never a priority in your life, I'm always
just your backup plan and I'm tired of it.

30
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,600
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,880
If that's the way you feel,
maybe I should quit.

32
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,520
Maybe you should.

33
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,920
Fine. I quit.

34
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,680
Help me get this stuff out of the back!

35
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,360
Right.

36
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,200
Hey!

37
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,760
- What do you think you're doing?
- Get out of here!

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,360
Hey!

39
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,000
Hurry up, dude. Hurry up.

40
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,520
Okay, let's go. Let's go!

41
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,600
I got it. I got it.

42
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,360
- How could they do it?
- What, beat the crap out of me?

43
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,320
I'm sorry, Dad, it just... It hurt.

44
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,760
It actually hurt.

45
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,760
- What'd you tell the police?
- I left beforehand.

46
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,680
You witnessed a crime.
You have an obligation to report it.

47
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,760
And put myself back on
Sheriff Adams' radar? I don't think so.

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,920
What could I tell her,
I used my x-ray vision to see the plate?

49
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,280
All right, I understand. Just calm down,
what else did you see?

50
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,880
He was wearing a class ring.

51
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,640
I think he goes to Smallville High.

52
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,960
Just because he has a class ring
doesn't necessarily mean he goes here.

53
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,080
I mean, he could be a graduate.

54
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,200
Meanwhile, in Lana-land,
looks like your ship's finally come in.

55
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,160
- Oh, I mean, we're...
- "Just friends."

56
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,680
You better invest in a new set of cue
cards. I've never seen her so happy.

57
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,520
I wish it was just me, but Lana's been
walking on air since her dad stepped up.

58
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,760
Pete, who's that guy?

59
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,360
You mean Eric Marsh?

60
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,040
You really need to pick up a sports page.

61
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,560
All right, Eric, show us what you got.

62
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,840
Let's go, Eric. Step up.

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,720
All right, give me some heat.

64
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,440
- Nice swing.
- Yeah.

65
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,760
Eric's got the highest batting average
in Smallville High history.

66
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,040
He really put the team on the map.

67
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,200
They're getting sponsorship for equipment
and uniforms because of him.

68
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,440
Not to mention the scouts that have
suddenly added a detour to Smallville.

69
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,560
Funny thing, though...

70
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,800
...he used to suck.

71
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,600
What do you mean?

72
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,520
We played on the same
Little League team for five years.

73
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,040
He was always a benchwarmer.

74
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,040
When did he go from zero to hero?

75
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,000
Not sure.

76
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,600
Sometimes you work hard enough,
you get your dream.

77
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,480
Or he's under some
pharmaceutical enhancement.

78
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,560
You thinking steroids?

79
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,640
Right now, I don't know what to think.

80
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,120
Lex.

81
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,600
It's been too long.

82
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,440
And I thought we agreed to keep
face-to-face contact to a minimum.

83
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,040
For business, perhaps.
This is a social call.

84
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,600
I've come to offer my congratulations
on your engagement.

85
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,280
Though I admit, I...

86
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,200
It hurt that I had to learn
of your pending nuptials...

87
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,680
...via the gossip pages of the Inquisitor.

88
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,160
Come on, Dad.

89
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,760
Since when has my personal happiness
ever been of the slightest interest to you?

90
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,640
And where is...

91
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,880
- Helen?
...Helen.

92
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,040
Helen's out of town at a medical seminar.

93
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,640
I suspect your visit would be putting her
anger management techniques to the test.

94
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,880
But then we both know you're not here
to discuss my wedding plans.

95
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,560
Oh, what is this?

96
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,920
Oh, Lex, I'm surprised that you would...

97
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,040
...put stock in the reportage
of a high-school newspaper.

98
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,760
I usually don't...

99
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,720
...but I did some checking of my own
and Io and behold, it's true.

100
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,680
What are you moving in the middle
of the night in unmarked trucks?

101
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,400
Nothing out of the ordinary.

102
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,040
I'd hate to think that you'd stoop to use
common thuggery to get back at me, son.

103
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,880
Wait a minute.

104
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Are you insinuating that I had something
to do with robbing your truck?

105
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,280
Dad.

106
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,720
That would be illegal.

107
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,640
Legalities are inconsequential.
I would want my property returned.

108
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,000
For what it's worth...

109
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,960
...I had nothing to do with it. But the fact
that you came to ask intrigues me.

110
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,160
What's in there
that's so important to you?

111
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,920
Give my regards to...

112
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,400
...your fiancée.

113
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,000
Enjoy.

114
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,000
Henry. This is a surprise.

115
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,760
Well, I was in the neighborhood.

116
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,680
Regular coffee, no additives. And when
you come by three times a week...

117
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,320
...you don't need the excuse.

118
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,280
I guess some small part of me
is still getting used to all this.

119
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,600
What, dropping by for a casual visit
with your daughter?

120
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,320
No, entering a business co-owned by
Luthor without an injunction in my hand.

121
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,960
Thanks. But it's been worth it.

122
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,920
I feel the same way.

123
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,640
- What's this?
- The seating chart for the show.

124
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,520
They set aside a section
for riders' families.

125
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,920
I took a leap and reserved
a couple of seats for you and Jennifer.

126
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
Lana, that was thoughtful.

127
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,080
Yes, I'll definitely be there.

128
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,280
But Jennifer won't.

129
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,920
She's never really accepted me, has she?

130
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,680
She just doesn't know you like I do.

131
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,040
Give her some time, she'll come around.

132
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,560
Pete, check this out.
Before Eric's sudden sports career...

133
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,080
...he was an honors chemistry student
with a straight-A average.

134
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,360
Guess you don't get the babes
and the free Nikes for that.

135
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,840
It says here he was in
a chemistry lab explosion...

136
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,960
...at Kansas State University
last summer during chemistry camp.

137
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,880
That's probably why
he's got the plate in his head.

138
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,040
Yeah, but what's he doing
knocking over a LuthorCorp truck?

139
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,360
I thought you quit the Torch.

140
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,120
Just clearing out my desk.

141
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,280
Wait a minute, you quit?

142
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,840
Apparently I can't be counted on.

143
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,440
I didn't even know quitting
was an option.

144
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,960
Funny.

145
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,440
Tough crowd.
Hey, I'll catch up with you later.

146
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,080
- Keep me posted on Eric.
- Yeah.

147
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,240
Marsh?
Why are you guys interested in him?

148
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,080
Doesn't matter.

149
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,280
Clark, I didn't ask you to quit the Torch.

150
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,880
Yeah, but all I do is disappoint you.

151
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,200
I didn't say that.

152
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,040
I just said you drop everything
for Lana with no regard for anyone else.

153
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,040
I thought this wasn't about Lana.

154
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,840
It's not.

155
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,880
- It's not.
- Every time you see us together...

156
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,840
...you look at me
like I'm cheating on you.

157
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,080
I'm sorry, but if that's the way you feel...

158
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,160
...maybe we shouldn't hang out anymore.

159
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,760
Tell me it's working, boys.

160
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,680
This stuff's incredible.

161
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,320
Another score
and we'll take it out on the street.

162
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,840
Yep, as long as there's enough for me.

163
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,680
I got a major league scout
coming to watch me next week.

164
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,640
Then you can make
the next batch, champ.

165
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,960
- Who do we have here?
- Hold him.

166
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,240
You're not going anywhere.

167
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,080
Were you following me, Kent?

168
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,160
I know you robbed that truck.

169
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,160
You're pretty smart.

170
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,840
But you see, I'm smart too.

171
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,440
I finally found a way
to have everything I wanted...

172
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,640
...and nobody is gonna mess that up.

173
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,360
You don't know what you're doing.

174
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Looks like you know
about the meteor rock.

175
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,760
It's dangerous. I've seen
what it can do to people.

176
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,000
Like get me a multimillion-dollar
contract in the majors?

177
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,720
He knows too much.

178
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,960
All right, get up.

179
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,160
If he goes, our problem goes with him.

180
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,080
We don't know who else he told.
Let's pack up and get out of here.

181
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,600
Let's go, man. Put this in the back.

182
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,800
- Clark. Oh, my God, what happened?
- I saw one of the hijackers.

183
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,120
He goes to our school. I followed him
to the old foundry. They jumped me.

184
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,240
Clark, you still couldn't stop them?

185
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,160
No, I think it has to do with
refined kryptonite.

186
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,640
They had kryptonite bars,
the same ones that were in Lionel's safe.

187
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,960
That's what they stole from the truck.

188
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,200
Clark, what would they be doing
with kryptonite?

189
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,520
Melting it down and inhaling it. That's
what's giving them incredible strength.

190
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,160
- Jonathan, we have to bring in the police.
- Yeah.

191
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,400
- The police can't do anything.
- Clark.

192
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,480
Dad, they threw me into a blast furnace.
They overpowered me.

193
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,680
If there was kryptonite in there,
I wouldn't be here now.

194
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,240
We can't let our concern about
your secret intimidate us into silence.

195
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,160
Maybe there is another way.

196
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,600
Marsh, drop the bat.

197
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,600
- What is this?
- I don't wanna tell you again. Drop it.

198
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,400
You're under arrest
for assault and armed robbery.

199
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,880
- What are you talking about?
- We got a tip, looked through your locker.

200
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,600
You can't without a warrant.

201
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,520
Guess again. We don't need a warrant
to look through a student's locker.

202
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,240
The driver, he came to long enough to tell
us about the aliens that trashed his truck.

203
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,000
Don't worry, now.
You can use your one call to phone home.

204
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,080
Okay, the only time you're ever this quiet
is when you're sleeping. What's up?

205
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,640
Clark and I decided to put our friendship
on an indefinite hiatus.

206
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,400
Over one newspaper story?

207
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,680
Let's just say that
certain insurmountable forces...

208
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,400
...finally made us raise the white flag.

209
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,840
I'm sorry. If there's anything
I can do to help...

210
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,840
Who is that?

211
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,960
Jennifer Small.

212
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,440
Thanks.

213
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,960
- Mrs. Small.
- It's not what you think, Lana.

214
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,680
I don't know what you mean.

215
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,720
I am not cheating on my husband.

216
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,080
I know that's what you thought.

217
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,640
But the man you saw me with was just...

218
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,120
...an old friend of mine from college.

219
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,120
Why are you telling me this?

220
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,320
- I wasn't gonna say anything to Henry.
- He's also my divorce attorney.

221
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,680
Divorce?

222
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,280
Henry never mentioned anything.

223
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,840
That's because he doesn't know.
At least, not yet.

224
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,680
Why are you divorcing him?

225
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,000
Lana, I've learned to handle
a lot in this marriage...

226
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,880
...but that's because through it all,
I knew I was Henry's priority.

227
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,120
Since he met you...

228
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,880
...I am not sure that's true anymore.

229
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,280
- I never meant to come between you.
- But you did.

230
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,840
Lana, you are all he talks about.

231
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,920
You're a window to a happier time.

232
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,400
I guess I am telling you this
because I'm admitting defeat.

233
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,200
You win.

234
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,440
Mrs. Small, I don't want to win.

235
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,280
Goodbye, Lana.

236
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,760
- So much for an interview.
- I admire your dedication.

237
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:28,600
Though I suspect the hospital
might not be quite so understanding.

238
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,400
Mr. Luthor.

239
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,840
What are you doing here?

240
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,640
Paying a bedside visit to a loyal employee.

241
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,400
It's Miss Sullivan, isn't it?

242
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,640
You know who I am?

243
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,760
I've followed your work
at the Torch for some time.

244
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,000
Given today's front-page scoop,
I assume you came...

245
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,400
...hoping Mr. O'Connor would confirm...

246
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,960
...his connection with LuthorCorp.

247
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,200
I think you just did that for him.

248
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,120
It was never a secret.

249
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,360
Unlike the now-missing
contents of your truck.

250
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,120
On or off the record?

251
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,600
The police report says robbery,
but no one's been able to find anything.

252
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,120
We were moving some industrial material.
It's nothing important.

253
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,760
Somebody sure went to
a lot of trouble to get to it.

254
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,200
Oh, it's a competitive world,
you know that.

255
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,960
Corporate sabotage is just
one of the costs of doing business.

256
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,080
- Mr. Luthor...
- Miss Sullivan, I admire your zeal...

257
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,640
...and your work at the Torch
is exemplary...

258
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,800
...but trust me.

259
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,200
You're looking for a mystery
where there's none to be found.

260
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,240
Clark.

261
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,760
Are you okay?

262
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,280
I got blind-sided yesterday by a couple
of guys. Guess I'm still a little shaken up.

263
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,160
What happened, did you get hurt?

264
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,840
I'll survive. It was more of a wrong place,
wrong time kind of thing.

265
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,880
I know the feeling,
at least metaphorically speaking.

266
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,720
I ran into Jennifer Small today.

267
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,600
Found out that she's filing
for divorce from Henry...

268
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,200
...and I'm the reason.

269
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,720
That's intense.

270
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,040
- Have you talked to Henry about it?
- What can I do without making it worse?

271
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,240
He should know, there might be
a chance to salvage his marriage.

272
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,080
Sounds like you should be
taking your own advice.

273
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,880
I hear you and Chloe are calling it quits.

274
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,760
That's different.

275
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,240
- Why?
- I can't just sit here...

276
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,160
...and watch Chloe get hurt over and over
when I can't do anything about it.

277
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,680
What's so bad that's come
between you two like this?

278
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,360
Well...

279
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,440
I wish I could make it go away.

280
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,760
- You can't.
- You and Chloe have been friends forever.

281
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,680
You can't just let that go without a fight.

282
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,640
At least the Clark Kent I know wouldn't.

283
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,720
If your father sent you,
I had nothing to do with the robbery.

284
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,240
No, no, my father doesn't know I'm here.

285
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,880
I'm sure his representatives
will be around, though.

286
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,160
No, I came to talk about your future.

287
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,600
- What do you care?
- I checked into your baseball career.

288
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,440
I understand there's interest
from some big league scouts.

289
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,400
Yeah, there's more than just interest.

290
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,400
All right?
There's college reps, there's agents.

291
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,080
This is just a bump in the road.

292
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,720
Two felony charges with bail set
at a quarter of a million dollars.

293
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,360
I'd say more like a brick wall,
wouldn't you?

294
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,040
- Why, do I look scared?
- You look guilty.

295
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,320
And if a jury agrees, you can kiss
all that talent and promise goodbye.

296
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,600
Like I told the cops, I didn't do it.

297
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,040
Well, I guess you have
nothing to worry about.

298
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,120
But if the charges stick...

299
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,560
...you might need a friend.

300
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,400
All right, what is it that you want?

301
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,840
I want to know what you stole
out of my father's truck.

302
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,240
Well, assuming that I even have a clue
what you're talking about...

303
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,800
...what's in it for me?

304
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,960
Chloe, what happened?

305
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,440
Go away, Clark.

306
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,800
Are you okay?

307
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,760
Physically, yeah, I'm fine.

308
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,800
Emotionally...

309
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,440
...what do you care?

310
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,840
I want to help.

311
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,600
We'll get the Torch back on its feet.

312
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,560
There is no "we" anymore, Clark.
There's only me.

313
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,320
And this paper was my whole life.

314
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,680
The one place I could come to when
everyone and everything let me down...

315
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,800
...and now I don't even
have that anymore.

316
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,760
- Where are you going?
- To find a friend.

317
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,000
Chloe.

318
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,360
Hey, Kent, I heard the paper's
not gonna press.

319
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,560
Did you do this?

320
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,160
I don't know how the hell you got out
of that fire, but you'd better back off.

321
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,680
What are you doing out of jail?

322
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,320
Seems I've got friends in higher places
that I didn't even know about...

323
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,400
...and suddenly you're not so anonymous.

324
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,600
I'll testify to put you away.

325
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,560
Oh, no, I'd think about that, Kent.

326
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,600
I know you're unbreakable,
but people that you care about...

327
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,880
...aren't. I'd sure hate to think...

328
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,840
...something happened
to those wholesome parents of yours.

329
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,720
Clark.

330
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,600
Clark.

331
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,520
Your mother.

332
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,320
How's Mom doing?

333
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,880
She's got some...

334
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,680
...minor cuts and bruises.
I still want to get her checked out.

335
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,160
This pregnancy doesn't need
any more complications.

336
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,240
I should've been there, Dad.

337
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,480
- You couldn't have done anything.
- Still.

338
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,920
I'm not gonna let you
beat yourself up about this.

339
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,400
What happens if they come back?

340
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,160
You and Mom should go away,
until this settles down.

341
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,560
I have never run away from a single thing
in my life and I'm not about to start now.

342
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,000
Look around,
look what they did to this place.

343
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,520
You said I can't protect you.

344
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,960
You have to think about Mom,
about the baby.

345
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,080
I am thinking about Mom,
I am thinking about the baby.

346
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,040
I'm also thinking about you.

347
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,200
Dad, please.

348
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,800
Please.

349
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,200
I'll take your mother to a doctor
in Metropolis...

350
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,000
...and maybe stay with your grandfather
for a couple days.

351
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,240
Son, I'd feel a whole hell of a lot better
if you'd agree to come with us.

352
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,480
I can't.

353
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,280
I'm not gonna stand here
and ask you to do nothing...

354
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,320
...because you and I both know
that I would not do nothing.

355
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,160
But I want you to
remember something, son.

356
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,320
They have your strength...

357
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,440
...but they don't have
any of your other abilities.

358
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,000
You make sure you give yourself
a fighting chance.

359
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,840
- Lex.
- I gotta let you go.

360
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,400
I just found out that you visited
Eric Marsh in jail.

361
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,480
Were you the one to bail him out?

362
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,840
I wasn't aware my visit
was public knowledge.

363
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,600
What's Marsh have to do with you?

364
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,840
I was the one who phoned
in the anonymous tip.

365
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,120
Him and his buddies nearly
killed my parents yesterday.

366
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,560
- Are they all right?
- They're in Metropolis, it's not safe here.

367
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,320
I heard your father's back.

368
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,520
- Lf this is some sick game between you...
- It's no game.

369
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,120
Clark, that truck was carrying a load
of highly refined meteor rocks.

370
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,760
If I'm not mistaken, I think my father's
resumed his Level 3 experiments.

371
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,640
What does that have to do with Marsh?

372
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,320
Look, I bailed him out,
hoping he'd provide answers.

373
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,600
Maybe he'd lead me to the meteor rock.

374
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,320
Where is he?

375
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,040
I don't know.

376
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,360
He beat up a security guard I had on him.

377
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,400
There's gotta be a way to draw him out.

378
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,720
Clark, I don't have anything Marsh wants.

379
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,760
Except for the meteor rocks.

380
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,120
Marsh has a connection inside LuthorCorp
that tells him when the shipments go out.

381
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,040
If he thinks your father's bringing
another load out...

382
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,600
I still have contacts at my father's firm.
They could let the word out.

383
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,480
The truck will be empty when Marsh hits.
My security team will be all over them.

384
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,640
I've seen what Eric can do.
You have to get the police on this.

385
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,360
Just go home, Clark.

386
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,080
I don't want you or your parents involved
any more than they already are.

387
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,720
Once Marsh and his friends have
the truck, give them a lot of room.

388
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,600
Nobody does anything
until they lead us to the meteor rock.

389
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,000
We're set, Mr. Luthor.

390
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,120
The truck's getting ready to move.

391
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,480
Wait for my signal
before you start following.

392
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,520
Nobody moves without my direct order...

393
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,600
Change of plans.

394
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,680
Okay, I've got the van.
Get ready to make the switch.

395
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,480
Anybody follow you?

396
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,040
I didn't see anyone, but we'd better
hurry. Luthor's bound to have it bugged.

397
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,000
How's it feel, Clark?

398
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,560
Eric, don't do this.

399
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,120
You don't understand, Kent.

400
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,280
It's done.

401
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,840
That's all of it.

402
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,360
At least for now.

403
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,240
Hey, Lex.

404
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,960
Clark, how are your parents doing?

405
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,120
Just fine. They got home
from Metropolis last night.

406
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,240
- That must be a relief.
- Yeah.

407
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,440
Eric's arrested, so it looks like
your plan came off without a hitch.

408
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,160
So it seems.

409
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,640
The intriguing thing is,
my people had nothing to do with it.

410
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,000
- Then who did?
- No one knows.

411
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,480
Marsh and his friends aren't talking...

412
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,080
...but they were found unconscious and
the meteor rocks are still unaccounted for.

413
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,280
Who do you think has them?

414
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,440
I have my suspicions.

415
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,640
Lana.

416
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,600
- Hey.
- Hey, Henry. Thanks for coming.

417
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,320
Your message said something
regarding the horse show.

418
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,400
I hope you're still planning to ride.

419
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,880
To be honest, I'm not sure.

420
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,640
I don't understand, I thought you were
really looking forward to this weekend.

421
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,760
I was. Believe me.

422
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,040
But I think it's more important
that you spend this time with Jennifer.

423
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:00,000
Lana, she told me you two talked. If this
is because of something she said...

424
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,880
No, I came into your life out of nowhere
and dropped a bomb on your family.

425
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,360
I didn't know how our relationship would
work out, but after a rocky start...

426
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,320
...I finally know that you love me.

427
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,240
I don't want to lose that.

428
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,040
I don't know what Jennifer told you,
but things between us aren't that bad.

429
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,040
Henry, she's hiring an attorney.

430
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,760
What?

431
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,320
You need to talk to her,
tell her how you feel.

432
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,080
Whatever happens after that is up to you.

433
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,440
You're my daughter,
I just can't walk away from that.

434
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,240
You're not.
I'll always be here.

435
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,880
But right now,
I think Jennifer needs you more.

436
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,120
Hey, Dad, how's Mom?

437
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,640
You'll be happy to know that both mother
and child got a clean bill of health.

438
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,280
- Good.
- Look, son, I wanted to tell you...

439
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,760
Hi, Lana.

440
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,840
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

441
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,640
- Miss Lang.
- Mr. Kent.

442
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,520
You must be here for Donatello.
I'll saddle him up.

443
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,320
No, I'm not practicing, Clark.

444
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,840
In fact, I think I might
drop out of the show.

445
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,880
I take it things with Henry
didn't go so well.

446
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,640
I told him I'd always be his daughter...

447
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,760
...but we should put our relationship on
hold until his marriage gets back on track.

448
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,960
- Wow.
- Yeah.

449
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,480
How are things with Chloe?

450
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,560
I went to go talk to her but this whole
Torch thing put her over the edge.

451
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,160
She told me to go away.

452
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,320
You two will work through this, Clark.

453
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,560
I hope so.

454
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,240
- I miss her already.
- I know what you mean.

455
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,640
I think we should remain
cautiously optimistic...

456
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,320
...that each of us will get
a second chance.

457
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,200
You know who's really
the loser in all this?

458
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,800
Donatello.

459
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,160
Poor horse worked so hard
and now he can't even strut his stuff.

460
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,200
I guess I can't disappoint him.

461
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,040
Besides, I wanted to share this
with someone special and I still am.

462
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,640
You're still going, aren't you, Clark?

463
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,840
You can count on me.

464
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,800
Miss Sullivan.

465
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,440
- Mr. Luthor.
- Your principal told me you might be here.

466
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,880
I hope I'm not interrupting you.

467
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,080
No. No, I mean...

468
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,280
...I've never entertained
a billionaire before.

469
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,240
You'll have to excuse the destruction.

470
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,840
- I was recently vandalized.
- So I heard.

471
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,280
By the same men
who hijacked my truck, I think.

472
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,120
Actually there's still a question.

473
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,480
Eric Marsh owned up to the robbery
of the truck and the assault...

474
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,800
...but he said he didn't have
anything to do with the Torch.

475
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,320
I mean, why confess
to the heavy crimes and deny that?

476
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,920
Well, it's not easy
to understand the criminal mind.

477
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,800
What's this?

478
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,120
This is an interesting display.

479
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,920
I call it the Wall of Weird.

480
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,400
I'll come to the point, Miss Sullivan.
I'd like to help you rebuild.

481
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,960
I've instructed the LuthorCorp foundation
to make a donation to your school...

482
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,840
...the fund specifically
earmarked toward rebuilding...

483
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,680
...and updating
the journalism department.

484
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,280
Mr. Luthor, I'm confused.

485
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,240
I mean, the struggling editor in me
wants to just leave it at "thank you"...

486
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,760
...but the journalist in me
has to ask, why?

487
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,640
I'm impressed with your...

488
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:02,120
...willingness to explore
alternative ideas, options.

489
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,120
You interned at the Daily Planet
this summer, didn't you?

490
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,560
Yeah.

491
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,560
I have a little influence there.

492
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,760
They certainly could use some new blood.

493
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,480
Maybe...

494
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,480
...a column...

495
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,360
...to introduce your unique point of view.

496
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,840
I don't want to look a gift horse
in the mouth...

497
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,360
...but I don't understand why the most
powerful man in this city is helping me.

498
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,040
We're after the same thing, Miss Sullivan.
The truth.

499
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,200
You know, journalists are
the midwives of history.

500
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,920
Perhaps with my help, we could...

501
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,760
...make history together.
