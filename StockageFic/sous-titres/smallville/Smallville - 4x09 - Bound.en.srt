1
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,695
What are you listening to?

2
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:14,023
My favorite song.

3
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:28,647
What's your name?

4
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:33,215
Does it really matter?

5
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:16,302
Housekeeping.

6
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:25,713
Mr. Luthor has no comment.

7
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:28,616
Don't say anything.

8
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:34,828
Look people I've told you,
my client has no comment, O.K.?

9
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:40,413
Billionaire Lex Luthor was released today
on $5 million bail, but we're told he's the

10
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:45,340
only suspect in the grisly slaying this
morning of a young woman whose body has

11
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,656
not yet been identified. The police
investigators -

12
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:54,910
So, you won't tell me how you wound up lying
naked, covered in blood, next to a dead girl

13
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,249
you hardly knew?
- I didn't kill her.

14
00:05:57,397 --> 00:06:02,089
I didn't ask. Lex you're paying me to get
you off, not to prove you're innocent.

15
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:05,810
But you're going to have
to be straight with me...

16
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:09,203
- Were you drinking last night?
- Yes.

17
00:06:09,294 --> 00:06:12,785
At the fundraiser in the hotel.
We had champagne.

18
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:15,917
- Is it possible that you were drugged?
- It wouldn't be the first time.

19
00:06:15,994 --> 00:06:20,500
If you were drugged it will show up in
the blood test I had you take.

20
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:24,665
In the meantime, you're going to have to try
to remember anything you can about this girl.

21
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:27,422
I can't.

22
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:33,572
She had a pink MP3 player.

23
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,944
- We listened to it together.
- That wasn't on the evidence list.

24
00:06:37,956 --> 00:06:41,522
Are you sure she had it with her
at the hotel?

25
00:06:43,364 --> 00:06:48,151
- Excuse me, Corinne. It's the D.A.
- Thank you Shannon, I'll be right there.

26
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:52,906
You stay put.
It's a media circus out there,

27
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:55,543
and I don't want you saying anything stupid.

28
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,358
Your bedside manner needs work.

29
00:06:58,457 --> 00:07:03,401
I'm not here to hold your hand, Lex.
You want a hug, call your mother.

30
00:07:05,713 --> 00:07:08,634
- Lex.
- Clark.

31
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:12,649
I take it you saw my
"Walk of Shame" on the news?

32
00:07:12,694 --> 00:07:15,970
- How are you holding up?
- Not so great actually.

33
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,385
- I trust you're here as a friend.
- Just tell me you didn't do this.

34
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:26,055
I met a girl at the Opera.

35
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:29,850
I took her to a hotel,
I didn't kill her.

36
00:07:30,286 --> 00:07:32,002
Who was she?

37
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:35,703
- I don't know.
- You slept with her but didn't know her name?

38
00:07:35,764 --> 00:07:40,758
It's one of those nights that never happens.
You meet someone and get caught in the moment.

39
00:07:41,104 --> 00:07:44,530
I'm guilty of that, but I'm not a murderer!

40
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:48,941
- It was my father, he's framing me.
- Your father's in prison.

41
00:07:48,987 --> 00:07:52,124
You really think that matters?

42
00:07:52,176 --> 00:07:57,197
Go home, Clark. You don't want to be
involved in this, trust me.

43
00:08:25,034 --> 00:08:28,141
[Je vais dors que seulment un temps]
I sleep for a while...

44
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:33,374
Countess Marguerite Isabelle Thoreaux,
you have been found guilty of practicing

45
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:40,076
the darkest art, Witchcraft. I hereby
condemn you to burn in the fires of hell.

46
00:08:41,111 --> 00:08:45,721
[Tu m'as trahi, Isabelle! Maintenant tu dois mourir.]
You betray me, Isabelle. You have to die.

47
00:09:19,563 --> 00:09:21,986
Clark, thank you for coming.

48
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:23,838
It's good to see you.

49
00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:42,854
How's Lex? I've been trying to contact him
since I heard, but he won't speak to me.

50
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:45,272
He thinks you're trying to frame him.

51
00:09:46,476 --> 00:09:47,867
Are you?

52
00:09:49,804 --> 00:09:52,861
- No Clark.
- Why should I believe you?

53
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,966
There's no reason you should.

54
00:09:57,157 --> 00:10:01,594
Listen to me, I was ill, Clark...

55
00:10:01,656 --> 00:10:06,327
The liver disease I had was
a death sentence...

56
00:10:06,821 --> 00:10:11,352
and something happened, I can't
explain it...

57
00:10:11,384 --> 00:10:16,352
I woke up on the floor, there
was a riot... I

58
00:10:18,508 --> 00:10:21,856
I felt as if...

59
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,923
a different kind of energy had been..
inside me,

60
00:10:27,952 --> 00:10:35,152
something strong, and...
good.

61
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:40,330
I was changed.

62
00:10:40,864 --> 00:10:44,629
And my liver had healed!

63
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:50,358
- What was it?
- I don't know.

64
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,968
All I can say was... It was miraculous!
I could see...

65
00:10:57,343 --> 00:11:04,031
The darkness... the destructive power
that had always been inside me.

66
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:09,703
I can see it in Lex now.

67
00:11:10,885 --> 00:11:13,550
I have to help him, Clark.

68
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,948
- Do you think he did it?
- No, this was a crime of passion,

69
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:24,123
or it was an elaborate frame.
The girl, did she have a car?

70
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:28,687
Lex told the police that he took her
to the hotel in his Ferrari.

71
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:32,134
Then they'll look for her car at the opera
house. They won't find it there.

72
00:11:32,216 --> 00:11:37,754
Lex has patterns. He would have had the
girl drive her own card to the hotel,

73
00:11:38,204 --> 00:11:41,985
so he could leave in the morning
and not have to take her home.

74
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:46,633
The patterns. The girl... she had
brown hair, yes?

75
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:50,498
She reminded him of Lillian.

76
00:11:50,563 --> 00:11:52,352
It's his mother.

77
00:11:53,495 --> 00:11:56,526
You have to help him, Clark.

78
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:02,611
- If I find this car...
- Anything you find, bring it to me, I can help you.

79
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:06,148
I'll see where it leads.

80
00:12:07,637 --> 00:12:10,573
- But I still don't trust you.
- I know.

81
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,253
But you will be back...
won't you?

82
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:26,267
Stupid, stupid.

83
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:31,807
- I swear, one time that thing actually bit me.
- Hi Lana, it does take a certain touch.

84
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:36,865
Are you feeling alright, you look a little pale.

85
00:12:38,097 --> 00:12:42,489
I just had this really weird dream last
night, I can't seem to shake it.

86
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:45,669
Oh, I'm sorry, Lana.
You have a visitor.

87
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,496
She's here for me?
Thanks.

88
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:58,322
Excuse me.

89
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,528
Lana!

90
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:07,437
It's wonderful to finally meet you.
You are beautiful.

91
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,629
I'm sorry, do I know you?

92
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,997
I'm Jason's mother.

93
00:13:14,374 --> 00:13:18,233
- Did I catch you off-guard?
- No... no.

94
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:24,711
Yeah actually, you have a little. I just
didn't know he was expecting you.

95
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,945
Well he isn't.

96
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,264
- Could we sit?
- Sure.

97
00:13:32,343 --> 00:13:34,642
Would you like some tea?

98
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:36,839
No thank you.

99
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:41,821
I know this sounds impossibly British, but
I can't bring myself to drink tea from a mug.

100
00:13:41,836 --> 00:13:45,106
- Is that terrible?
- No, of course not.

101
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:52,022
How's Jason? I haven't spoken to him since
he left Paris...

102
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:56,353
And he won't answer any of my calls.
I'm afraid that...

103
00:13:56,412 --> 00:14:01,094
- I am afraid he thinks that I'm angry with him.
- You're not?

104
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:04,374
I simply want to see him again.

105
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:09,351
Mrs. Teague, I...
I've wanted to meet you.

106
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:14,787
But if Jason isn't ready to be a part of
your life, I don't think I can either.

107
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:18,565
Not behind his back.

108
00:14:19,245 --> 00:14:24,202
The last thing I want to do is put you in
the middle of this, but...

109
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:30,382
If you could just tell him that I'm here,
and that I'm staying at the Smallville Inn.

110
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,716
Tell him I want to see him.

111
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:35,863
Sure.

112
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:37,477
Thanks.

113
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:44,998
You know what's interesting? A moment ago, when
I met you, you looked like you recognized me..

114
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:49,581
How can that be?

115
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:59,116
Goodbye, Lana. You must come and visit
me in Metropolis.

116
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:04,052
You are so beautiful.

117
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:08,240
I see now why he had to be with you.

118
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:25,746
- Where have you been all afternoon?
- I went to see Lionel at the prison.

119
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:30,034
Why, are you backlogged with your Community
Service hours or something?

120
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:33,135
No, look, I know this sounds crazy,

121
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:37,655
But Lionel gave me a lead in Lex's case,
he said I'd find the girl's car in the hotel

122
00:15:37,678 --> 00:15:41,147
and I think I did...
Check this out,

123
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:47,691
There were 22 cars checked into the hotel
valet that night after 10pm when Lex said he

124
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:52,600
left the opera. Of those cars, all but 3 were
hotel guests, and of those 3, two belong to

125
00:15:52,636 --> 00:15:55,595
guys that were in the hotel bar.
- Leaving one.

126
00:15:55,672 --> 00:15:58,296
Exactly, but I haven't been able to trace
a name or address.

127
00:15:58,354 --> 00:16:01,433
Why am I not surprised?
Let me try.

128
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,157
You know what the weird thing is?
The police aren't even looking into this.

129
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:11,924
Of course not, Clark. They think that Lex
is guilty, and they've already got their man.

130
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:17,174
But don't you think it's possible that this
is a setup? I mean, Lionel Luthor goes all

131
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:22,188
"Hannibal Lechter" and tells you what to
look for, and where to find it.

132
00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:27,547
I don't think so. I can't explain this, but
something happened to Lionel in prison,

133
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:30,304
- I think it changed him.
- Clark...

134
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:35,000
- And what if he really can help?
- Clark, he's the master manipulator, you can't

135
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,726
trust him, O.K.? Besides, Lex is in great hands.
He's got Corinne Harper leading his defense.

136
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:44,651
They call her "The Barracuda".
What he really needs is a good publicist.

137
00:16:44,748 --> 00:16:46,975
Have you see this?

138
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:51,942
The police have interviewed over 13 women
that have slept with Lex in the past year.

139
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:56,192
What's wrong?

140
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:01,826
Lex told me this one-night-stand was
something that never happens.

141
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:05,823
- And you believed him?
- I've got to believe somebody, Chloe.

142
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,859
There it is.

143
00:17:13,677 --> 00:17:18,524
Eve Andrews, Age 28.
Lives in Metropolis.

144
00:17:46,663 --> 00:17:47,797
Lex.

145
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:51,551
- What are you doing?
- I'm saving my ass, Clark.

146
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:54,458
What the hell are you doing here?

147
00:17:57,921 --> 00:18:00,687
You've got to help me... Please.

148
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:12,971
You were burning evidence, Lex.
Not exactly the actions of an innocent man!

149
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:15,400
Come on, Clark, think about it!

150
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:18,711
If I killed that girl, Why would I take a nap
next to her body so the maid can find me?

151
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,907
- It doesn't make any sense.
-Nor does breaking into her house, but you did that.

152
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:26,541
You better be honest with me, cause
right now, I'm an accomplice.

153
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:28,839
I didn't ask you to show up.

154
00:18:29,062 --> 00:18:31,197
How did you even know to go there?

155
00:18:32,606 --> 00:18:35,355
- I tracked down her car.
- Did you call the cops, too?

156
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:38,598
- No.
- Cause this is going to be on the 6:00 news now!

157
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,102
- Why'd you go there, Lex?
- I got a call from Corinne's office, saying

158
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:48,171
they had a lead on an address. I thought
maybe I could find out who she was.

159
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,730
I had no idea what I was walking into.

160
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:54,114
- What did you find out?
- Her name's Eve Andrews.

161
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:58,504
And as you can tell from the stack of photos,
she's been stalking me for some time.

162
00:18:58,588 --> 00:19:01,808
- So you did know her?
- No, only by name, but she didn't tell me

163
00:19:01,844 --> 00:19:04,850
at the fundraiser,
so how was I supposed to know?

164
00:19:05,016 --> 00:19:07,959
Clark, you know I didn't do this!

165
00:19:08,352 --> 00:19:10,929
It's my father trying to get back at me.

166
00:19:11,005 --> 00:19:14,929
He knows about all these stalkers! Luthorcorp's
lawyers compiled a database about them

167
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:19,541
last year. My father knew Eve would be the
perfect victim to make it look like I had motive.

168
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:22,407
I don't think it's your father, Lex.

169
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,599
I went to see him.
He wants to help.

170
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:36,155
He was the one who sent you looking
for her car, wasn't he?

171
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:38,461
- Yes.
- You're playing right into his hands.

172
00:19:38,537 --> 00:19:41,883
- Lex.
- You can't straddle the fence on this one Clark,

173
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:46,243
My father and I are enemies!
You have to decide who you really trust!

174
00:19:50,332 --> 00:19:53,058
She was stalking him and he didn't know
what she looked like?

175
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,435
He said he'd never seen her before.

176
00:19:55,523 --> 00:19:59,104
Lex lied about a lot of things,
he lied about all those women.

177
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,746
Do you think he could have done it?

178
00:20:01,776 --> 00:20:05,380
I have to say the whole "Firestarter" thing
doesn't scream "innocence", but...

179
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:09,740
there's something really strange about this.
Look at this.

180
00:20:12,725 --> 00:20:15,790
Wait, I thought Lex's attorneys had all this
under lock and key.

181
00:20:15,874 --> 00:20:19,911
Well, she may know people at the top, but I
know people at the bottom, and they work for tips.

182
00:20:19,937 --> 00:20:21,674
Check this out.

183
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:23,262
See?

184
00:20:24,402 --> 00:20:27,301
- She's wearing 2 diamond earrings. See that?
- Yeah.

185
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:31,781
O.K. now we're going to skip all this gross
"Zalman King" stuff...

186
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:37,088
Just before they get out of the elevator and
onto the penthouse floor... and look.

187
00:20:42,194 --> 00:20:46,044
- She lost an earring.
- Exactly. The police report said the dead

188
00:20:46,103 --> 00:20:49,885
woman was wearing 2 diamond earrings. So
either she found it, or...

189
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,790
Lex was with 2 different women.

190
00:20:56,911 --> 00:20:58,804
Thank you, Shannon.

191
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:09,031
That was my assistant.

192
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,180
Your tox screen came back negative, Lex.

193
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:16,509
- There were no drugs in your system.
- So it left my system, or the test was altered.

194
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,483
That's certainly not beyond
my father's capabilities.

195
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:24,028
They've got you lying next to the body, covered
in blood, and now that they I.D'ed the victim

196
00:21:24,068 --> 00:21:26,680
they also have motive.
- Why, because she was stalking me?

197
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:31,360
Yes. Do you even know why she was
stalking you, Lex?

198
00:21:32,311 --> 00:21:35,453
Because you slept with her 18 months ago.

199
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:40,193
And then you sent her a pair of diamond
earrings as a consolation prize.

200
00:21:40,268 --> 00:21:42,928
How could you not remember her?

201
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:47,779
I don't always get their names,
or remember their faces.

202
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:51,704
I suppose it doesn't help that we
all look alike, does it?

203
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:56,249
I was your type too, Lex.
Or don't you remember that, either?

204
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:01,668
- I remember, Corinne.
- Ooh. Goody for me.

205
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,470
You must enjoying this on some level.
Seeing me pay for my indiscretions.

206
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,679
I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a certain
amount of satisfaction

207
00:22:09,747 --> 00:22:12,830
seeing you hoisted on your own petard.

208
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,977
On the plus side, the view from up here
is exceedingly clear.

209
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:22,853
See I've been thinking that whoever did this
would need to have access to my legal files

210
00:22:22,902 --> 00:22:25,328
to know Eve was stalking me.

211
00:22:26,284 --> 00:22:29,588
I thought it was my dad,
but maybe I was wrong.

212
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:34,547
That database was your project, wasn't it?

213
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:38,781
You know what, I knew there might be a
conflict of interest when I took this case.

214
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:41,924
But I had hoped we got past all that.

215
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:45,780
Apparently I was wrong.

216
00:22:49,264 --> 00:22:52,234
I'm removing myself as your attorney.

217
00:23:00,293 --> 00:23:03,747
So, the police still haven't picked up on the
"missing earring" thing, and according to

218
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:07,929
the people at the front desk, they haven't
found anything yet. So that's where we're at.

219
00:23:11,982 --> 00:23:14,167
Well, if I were an earring...

220
00:23:15,773 --> 00:23:20,974
Let's re-enact the event, O.K.? So Lex
had Eve up against this wall here, so...

221
00:23:22,814 --> 00:23:26,613
O.K., come on big boy, it's for the cause
of truth and justice, now push me up against

222
00:23:26,635 --> 00:23:30,781
the wall. And her hand was like this,

223
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:35,763
and I think his hand was like this...

224
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,315
Maybe he knocked the earring
off accidentally.

225
00:23:41,928 --> 00:23:47,356
Yeah. Yeah, and then she pushed him up
against this wall over here like this.

226
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,549
Hi.

227
00:23:55,807 --> 00:23:57,325
Oh my.

228
00:23:57,483 --> 00:24:01,621
- It's O.K. You can come in.
- No that's fine, we'll just take the stairs.

229
00:24:02,228 --> 00:24:06,081
No, but nothing was happening!
We weren't doing anything! Really!

230
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:12,203
Hey Clark.

231
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:18,517
What if the earring fell down this crack?

232
00:24:34,303 --> 00:24:37,094
I'm glad you came back, Clark.

233
00:24:37,096 --> 00:24:39,243
Why did you bring me this?

234
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,699
I didn't think Lex would tell me the truth.

235
00:24:43,508 --> 00:24:45,450
And you believe that I will?

236
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:48,861
You wanted to help.
I'm trusting you.

237
00:24:49,808 --> 00:24:52,742
That belonged to the girl that Lex
met at the Opera.

238
00:24:52,814 --> 00:24:54,852
Eve Andrews, yes?

239
00:24:56,731 --> 00:25:01,452
Well that's the thing. Eve Andrews was
wearing 2 earrings when she died.

240
00:25:01,488 --> 00:25:05,698
I think there's 2 girls. And I think the girl
in the elevator is still alive.

241
00:25:05,699 --> 00:25:08,021
I just don't know how to find her.

242
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:15,370
"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. "

243
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:20,761
When I was younger, and I wanted to
get rid of a woman, I would...

244
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,591
send her a pair of diamond earrings.

245
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:27,096
Delivered by courier,
no messy farewells.

246
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,458
It was my signature.

247
00:25:29,824 --> 00:25:33,822
My son, it seems, is carrying
on the tradition.

248
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,868
The girl in the elevator is a former
lover of Lex's.

249
00:25:39,313 --> 00:25:41,397
She's the killer.

250
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:48,951
Factor his position on the case
of the Merrins...

251
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:10,000
O.K., Corinne, I'm here. What's this
new evidence you wanted to talk about?

252
00:26:10,103 --> 00:26:12,926
First you quit, now you're back...

253
00:26:12,973 --> 00:26:15,373
Look, I came a long way,
what do you want?

254
00:26:31,217 --> 00:26:34,146
- 911 emergency.
- Yeah, someone's been killed.

255
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:38,087
I'm sorry all lines are busy at the moment.
Please hold for the first emergency operator.

256
00:26:56,787 --> 00:26:59,623
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong Lex?

257
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:07,321
Don't you recognize me?

258
00:27:27,087 --> 00:27:28,774
Promise to be quiet?

259
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:39,193
- Welcome home.
- How'd you get past my security?

260
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:44,047
I work for your law firm, Lex. I told them
you'd been drinking in Metropolis,

261
00:27:44,152 --> 00:27:49,218
and you needed a ride home...
They helped me carry you up here.

262
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,121
Why here. Why are you doing this?

263
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:56,149
Because this is where it all happened.

264
00:27:56,636 --> 00:27:59,718
This is where I earned my earrings...

265
00:28:00,227 --> 00:28:02,183
The first time.

266
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:07,262
You see, you remember the other night, but
you don't remember the first time.

267
00:28:08,308 --> 00:28:09,357
I do.

268
00:28:09,427 --> 00:28:12,766
I had a fiancee.
But you didn't know that.

269
00:28:13,156 --> 00:28:16,950
I cheated on him with you because
I thought that you loved me.

270
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:22,254
And when I broke it off with him,
I called to tell you that.

271
00:28:22,298 --> 00:28:24,422
But you wouldn't take my call.

272
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:27,957
I'm sorry.
If I had known...

273
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:34,195
But you didn't. And then 3 months later,
I bump into you outside of Corinne's office,

274
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:38,481
and you don't even recognize me.
It was like I never happened to you.

275
00:28:38,574 --> 00:28:42,444
And so I started going through your files.

276
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:46,786
Turns out I wasn't the only one.

277
00:28:47,147 --> 00:28:49,332
Eve Andrews.

278
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:52,563
Among others.

279
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:56,209
But she was such a fan.

280
00:28:57,523 --> 00:29:00,741
I told her that you wanted to make amends.

281
00:29:00,898 --> 00:29:06,921
And she agreed to come to the hotel, and then
I slipped something into your champagne

282
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:12,421
after we made love. It's funny your
blood tests didn't pick that up.

283
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:16,141
- You rigged the tests.
- I just switched out the results.

284
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,222
You were the one that sent me to her place.
You called the police.

285
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:26,141
You were supposed to get caught. But you
didn't... and so here we are.

286
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:37,310
Hey. What's wrong?
You haven't said anything all night.

287
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:41,673
Talk to me.

288
00:29:43,438 --> 00:29:45,474
I met your mom.

289
00:29:46,677 --> 00:29:48,195
Where?

290
00:29:49,077 --> 00:29:52,145
Here. She...

291
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:56,564
she said that you weren't returning her
calls, so she came to see me.

292
00:29:57,353 --> 00:30:00,727
She's staying at the Smallville Inn,
wants you to stop by.

293
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,163
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

294
00:30:04,217 --> 00:30:06,320
I don't know.

295
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:09,612
I guess...

296
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:14,498
Maybe I don't want to be the one
passing notes between you and your mother.

297
00:30:17,977 --> 00:30:20,754
I wouldn't have asked you to do that.

298
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:24,406
She had no right to come here.

299
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,799
I'm sorry.

300
00:30:32,522 --> 00:30:34,640
She seemed really worried about you.

301
00:30:34,673 --> 00:30:38,048
I bet she did.
I bet she seemed sad, and...

302
00:30:38,198 --> 00:30:40,177
heartbroken...

303
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:43,265
But, she's not.

304
00:30:43,482 --> 00:30:48,826
She's manipulative... and all my life she's
tried to control me.

305
00:30:52,523 --> 00:30:54,919
What, is there something else?

306
00:30:55,401 --> 00:30:57,552
I dreamed about her.

307
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:01,507
I mean, I was dreaming about
Isabelle Thoreaux.

308
00:31:02,087 --> 00:31:04,890
She was being burned at the stake.

309
00:31:06,258 --> 00:31:09,307
And suddenly, your mom was there.

310
00:31:10,684 --> 00:31:14,183
It's probably not unusual to dream about
somebody you just met.

311
00:31:14,256 --> 00:31:15,885
Jason.

312
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:20,854
I dreamt about her
before I met her...

313
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:29,796
There it is...

314
00:31:29,849 --> 00:31:33,592
- Just like he said.
- How do they get the serial numbers so small?

315
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,498
It's lilliputian.

316
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:38,571
Lasers. Lionel said all the high-end
diamond dealers do it.

317
00:31:38,674 --> 00:31:41,477
In case it ever gets lost or stolen, you
can track it down.

318
00:31:41,495 --> 00:31:44,025
Or it can track you down.

319
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:48,411
Oh, I still can't believe that Lionel actually
called his old jewelry guy, and

320
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:51,500
had him send over the purchase orders.

321
00:31:51,832 --> 00:31:58,456
- Alright, give me the numbers.
- 722DJS3970.

322
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:04,401
Here we go, 2 diamond earrings.
Wow, very expensive.

323
00:32:04,435 --> 00:32:07,748
Couriered to Ms. Shannon Bell.

324
00:32:07,805 --> 00:32:12,851
- Shannon Bell, how do I know that name.
- According to this, she works in Lex's law firm.

325
00:32:13,518 --> 00:32:16,960
-We have to warn him.
- I'll call the police.

326
00:32:23,462 --> 00:32:26,592
You know you could have
stopped all this, Lex.

327
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:31,385
All you had to do was recognize me outside
of the Opera.

328
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:36,255
Just say, "Hi Shannon, it's nice to see you. "

329
00:32:37,218 --> 00:32:39,048
But you didn't.

330
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:43,061
I was wearing the earrings that you bought me.

331
00:32:43,188 --> 00:32:47,401
We had sex again and you still
didn't recognize me!

332
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,416
I had a life, Lex.

333
00:32:51,743 --> 00:32:54,491
I had a fiancee.

334
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:02,010
You ruined my life, and...
you didn't even know who I was!

335
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:08,646
And you do this...
all the time.

336
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:13,783
Please don't do this!

337
00:33:18,876 --> 00:33:21,109
It has to stop.

338
00:34:13,611 --> 00:34:15,900
LUTHOR ACQUITTED OF DOUBLE HOMICIDE

339
00:34:15,994 --> 00:34:20,463
I'm glad Lex was found innocent, but I wish
you would've come to us before you got involved.

340
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:24,742
First, Dad, I just wanted to help, then I
had to figure out if I could trust him or not.

341
00:34:25,076 --> 00:34:27,045
What did you decide?

342
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,881
I haven't.

343
00:34:29,882 --> 00:34:32,614
I mean, the way he treated those women.

344
00:34:34,001 --> 00:34:37,051
It showed me a side of Lex
I hadn't seen before.

345
00:34:37,103 --> 00:34:40,159
I mean, how could you just not care
that you hurt someone?

346
00:34:41,104 --> 00:34:44,712
Lex was just following
what he's learned son, that's all.

347
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:52,143
There's something else you should know.

348
00:34:53,275 --> 00:34:55,288
I went to see Lionel.

349
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:58,312
- What?
- He wanted to help Lex, and he did.

350
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,869
I couldn't have done it without him.

351
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:05,016
Clark... you know how dangerous that
man is to you.

352
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:09,543
Dad, that's the thing. I think he's
changed... and his liver healed.

353
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,211
I thought his condition was terminal.

354
00:35:13,338 --> 00:35:16,398
I think something in me actually... healed him.

355
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:24,697
- Clark, does Lionel know about this?
- No, he actually thinks... it's a miracle.

356
00:35:26,194 --> 00:35:27,879
It is.

357
00:35:28,598 --> 00:35:31,970
Look, I know this sounds crazy,
but I really think he has changed.

358
00:35:32,057 --> 00:35:33,535
I could see it in his eyes.

359
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:39,090
Clark, as far as I'm concerned, Lionel Luthor
is never going to change, and neither is Lex.

360
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,600
And we're just going to have
to accept that.

361
00:35:54,793 --> 00:35:58,151
I understand you helped vindicate me, Dad.

362
00:35:58,332 --> 00:36:01,738
There's just no telling the influence you
seem to have from behind these bars.

363
00:36:01,935 --> 00:36:05,341
I pointed your friend Clark in the right
direction, that's all I did.

364
00:36:06,277 --> 00:36:08,973
You still believe I had something to do
with this, don't you?

365
00:36:09,028 --> 00:36:10,573
No.

366
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:13,346
I just assume you must
want something in return.

367
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,989
Yes.

368
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,710
Yes I do.

369
00:36:17,733 --> 00:36:20,111
I'm not helping you get released.

370
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:24,659
You don't understand. I know that
I deserve to be here...

371
00:36:24,665 --> 00:36:27,342
in this terrible place.

372
00:36:27,607 --> 00:36:30,777
I have no one to blame but myself.

373
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:39,060
I'm in a generous mood, Dad.
So...

374
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:41,606
let's say I believe that.

375
00:36:46,502 --> 00:36:48,681
What do you want from me?

376
00:36:50,151 --> 00:36:53,367
I want to be your father...
Lex.

377
00:36:54,543 --> 00:36:56,151
If you'll let me.

378
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,651
You've got your health, Dad.

379
00:37:05,038 --> 00:37:08,075
Don't expect another miracle.

380
00:38:00,631 --> 00:38:03,037
I wanted to say thank you.

381
00:38:03,154 --> 00:38:04,932
And I'm sorry.

382
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,459
I know you were only trying to help me.

383
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:11,865
How long is this going to continue, Lex?

384
00:38:11,943 --> 00:38:13,505
I don't know.

385
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:18,013
What do you want me to tell you?

386
00:38:18,895 --> 00:38:21,431
I don't want you to tell me anything.

387
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:24,007
I want you to change.

388
00:38:24,031 --> 00:38:26,640
I don't know if I can.

389
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,447
You know, it seems the only person that
you care about is yourself.

390
00:38:33,889 --> 00:38:37,529
There's a whole side of you that
I don't know about, Lex.

391
00:38:38,624 --> 00:38:40,654
What else don't I know about you?

392
00:38:42,383 --> 00:38:46,359
You don't know that everyday I wonder
why I keep going...

393
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,925
why I do the things I do.

394
00:38:54,617 --> 00:38:57,495
You know Shannon might have been crazy...

395
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,939
but she was right about me.

396
00:39:01,891 --> 00:39:04,921
I treated those women terribly, Clark.

397
00:39:05,646 --> 00:39:08,796
People died, and I could have stopped it.

398
00:39:09,774 --> 00:39:12,148
I see that now.

399
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,001
That's a start.

400
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:20,128
You know there was a moment the other night,
when that fire she set was coming toward me...

401
00:39:20,173 --> 00:39:22,901
I thought, "Good... "

402
00:39:24,608 --> 00:39:27,586
"save the world a lot of grief. "

403
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:30,471
But somehow the fire went out.

404
00:39:32,182 --> 00:39:35,090
And she was lying on the floor...

405
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,115
and suddenly I had a second chance.

406
00:39:42,348 --> 00:39:44,830
The last few days, Lex...

407
00:39:45,661 --> 00:39:48,968
I thought your father was being more
honest with me that you were...

408
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,353
And I hated that feeling.

409
00:39:53,507 --> 00:39:56,326
I felt like we were enemies.

410
00:39:57,115 --> 00:40:00,171
Don't give up on me yet.

411
00:40:17,547 --> 00:40:19,727
What are you doing here, mother?

412
00:40:21,114 --> 00:40:23,968
I know you don't want to
talk to me, Jason.

413
00:40:24,274 --> 00:40:27,168
But every mother has a right
to see her only son.

414
00:40:27,253 --> 00:40:29,317
You didn't come here to see me.

415
00:40:29,392 --> 00:40:32,329
Is it so terrible to want to meet
your girlfriend?

416
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,865
It's the way you go about it. I'm not going
to let you do it this time.

417
00:40:35,871 --> 00:40:38,307
'Cause it's different.

418
00:40:40,643 --> 00:40:43,467
I will come see you when I'm ready.

419
00:40:44,186 --> 00:40:45,588
When will that be?

420
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:48,705
I don't know.
But you can't come back here.

421
00:40:49,768 --> 00:40:52,182
I just want you to know, Jason...

422
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,920
that I'm really glad that you're happy,
and Lana is...

423
00:40:56,012 --> 00:40:58,372
an enchanting girl.

424
00:40:59,512 --> 00:41:03,895
I can see why you moved to the middle of
nowhere to be with her, I mean she's...

425
00:41:04,293 --> 00:41:06,084
she's special.

426
00:41:07,556 --> 00:41:10,675
I knew you'd meet someone like her one day.

427
00:41:17,222 --> 00:41:20,421
Did I meet her by accident, or not?

428
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:26,926
What on Earth are you implying, of course you
did, Jason! How else could you meet her?

429
00:41:32,144 --> 00:41:35,101
I'll wait to hear from you.
