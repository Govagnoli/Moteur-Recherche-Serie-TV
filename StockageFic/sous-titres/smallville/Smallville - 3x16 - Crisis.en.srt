1
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:06,198
I didn't think Lana would find someone
to cover her shift this late in the game.

2
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:08,636
Guess I should have figured
on the Clark factor.

3
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:12,175
It sounded like she was having her
own crisis over Jensen's history exam.

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,746
Thanks for coming. I know this can't
compete with the all-you-can-drink...

5
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,281
-...Talon cram session.
-Definitely not.

6
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:25,186
I think it's great you spend so much time
volunteering here.

7
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,826
Someone's always been there
when I've been in trouble.

8
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:30,053
Seems like a good way
to give something back.

9
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:31,856
Hi, Pete.

10
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,433
And to hone your sensitive-guy skills.

11
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:41,439
Watch and learn.

12
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,499
Teen Crisis Hotline.

13
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:52,111
Well, how long has it been
since they've been divorced?

14
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,049
Yeah, I know. That can be tough.

15
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:58,286
Well, have you talked to them about it?

16
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,590
Yeah.

17
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:10,727
Teen Crisis Hotline.

18
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:13,137
-Clark!
-Lana.

19
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,997
Clark, it's happening!

20
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:17,605
-Are you there?
-Lana?

21
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,768
-He's got a gun!
-And the shot is up....

22
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:24,010
And good. 61 to 60, Vipers.

23
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:29,986
Clark! Please, help me!

24
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,454
Lana? Lana, what?

25
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:38,722
Lana? Lana?

26
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:52,167
Lana! Lana, can you hear me? Lana!

27
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:53,976
Pete, call the police.

28
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:56,910
Hey-- Please hold. Hold.

29
00:02:18,237 --> 00:02:20,728
Hey, Clark. Knock much?

30
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:24,774
You're too late. I turned off
the cappuccino machine an hour ago.

31
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,435
Please, help me!

32
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,669
Lana? Lana!

33
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,974
The call came from a blocked lD.

34
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:43,486
-Sounds like your voice, Ms. Lang.
-I know, but it can't be.

35
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,420
We think it's some sort
of a prank, sheriff.

36
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:52,055
You know, usually these situations originate
a little closer to home than you'd expect.

37
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,458
Any reason you might wanna
goose these boys with a crank call?

38
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:59,202
-Lana didn't have anything to do with this.
-Unless Ms. Lang has grown...

39
00:03:59,371 --> 00:04:02,363
...several inches and developed
an affinity for plaid...

40
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,408
...this would be a good time
for you to pipe down.

41
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,103
I suppose someone
could be imitating you.

42
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,005
Why would anyone do that?

43
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,714
If I had the answer to half the "whys"
in this town...

44
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,683
...I'd have a bestseller on my hands.

45
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:17,917
I'll look into this.

46
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,754
But you kids need to know that crank calls
aren't exactly a top priority.

47
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:28,797
You okay?

48
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:31,795
You know, if someone is doing this
as a joke...

49
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,599
...they have a pretty sick
sense of humor.

50
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:38,231
Don't worry. We'll figure out who did this.

51
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:50,110
This connection's bad.
We're missing pieces of the conversation.

52
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:54,123
But the background noise
is constant throughout.

53
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:56,523
This recording wasn't
piecemealed together.

54
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:59,858
Here, I'll play it again with the static
as low as I can get it.

55
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:05,398
That sounds like rain.

56
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,673
We haven't had a storm in months.

57
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,542
Clark, it's happening!

58
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:14,507
Why would I say that?

59
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,274
It's almost like
you were expecting something.

60
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,551
Clark! Please, help me!

61
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,916
You lied to me!

62
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,159
Hey, Chloe, can l?

63
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,889
Yeah.

64
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:36,891
I think I heard something.

65
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,409
You lied to me!

66
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:51,447
That's Adam.

67
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,484
But I haven't spoken to him since he left.

68
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:56,779
Clark, how did you hear that?

69
00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:02,058
Guess I missed too many Linkin Park
concerts. Look, there's someone else here.

70
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,986
He shoots....

71
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:10,260
And good. That makes the score
61 to 60, Vipers.

72
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,564
Gunnerson needs to miss the second shot
to keep the Vipers ' hopes...

73
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:15,866
-...for an undefeated season alive.
-Gunnerson?

74
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,668
He was benched in the preseason.

75
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:20,744
-This has to be a recording of an old game.
-No, that can't be.

76
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,041
This is the first year the Vipers
have been undefeated.

77
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:33,755
They're not even scheduled to play
the Metros until tonight.

78
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:38,794
And according to the weather service,
a storm's on the way.

79
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:43,861
Well, if none of this has happened yet,
maybe the phone call hadn't either.

80
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:49,472
You're saying the call came
from the future?

81
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,144
What is this?

82
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,916
An experimental medication.

83
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:09,788
Not exactly FDA approved, but I assume
you're working on the patent.

84
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,590
Oh, Lex, I don't have time for 20 questions.

85
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,790
I know about the lab at Metron.

86
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,000
Gives new meaning to the term
"human resources."

87
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,872
You know, there are hundreds of
projects in development at LuthorCorp.

88
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:27,877
You'll have to forgive me if I'm not current
on all the details about.... What, Metron?

89
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:32,309
You're secretly developing a serum...

90
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:36,648
...that has a certain Lazarus effect
on the dearly departed.

91
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:40,653
Resuscitating the dead?

92
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:49,257
I think your creative talents
are being wasted at LuthorCorp, son.

93
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,734
Unfortunately, this isn't fiction.

94
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:57,567
So far, the Kafkaesque trials have caused
patients' bodies...

95
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:01,736
...to deteriorate while their minds
retain consciousness.

96
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:03,915
Sort of bypasses the code of ethics...

97
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:08,076
...but I suppose if you were successful,
it could mean big business.

98
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:11,914
I applaud your moral outrage...

99
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:17,893
...but these papers don't specifically
confirm any of your accusations, son.

100
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,132
Although they would raise a few eyebrows
at the Daily Planet.

101
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:26,765
You know, you don't have to resort
to threats, Lex...

102
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,907
...if you wanna shut this project down.

103
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,777
I must not be making myself clear.

104
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,339
I came back to LuthorCorp to be
your partner, not a paper pusher.

105
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:42,009
This new project can make the company
billions of dollars.

106
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:44,781
I don't want it shut down.

107
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,360
I wanna be put in charge of it.

108
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,568
What are you doing?
This is a restricted area.

109
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:11,011
Apparently not.

110
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,712
You failed to mention, Dr. Teng,
that my son...

111
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:22,156
...recently paid you a visit.

112
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:27,094
I don't know how he found us,
but I didn't tell him anything.

113
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:32,203
That's irrelevant now because, as of
this moment, this project never existed.

114
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,464
We haven't tested
the most recent adjustments.

115
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,268
Don't worry, Dr. Teng,
your work will continue.

116
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:38,841
Just not here.

117
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:45,581
I want this lab cleared out
by the end of the day.

118
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:50,915
Or this time you will find yourself deported
back to your native homeland.

119
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:57,392
If I'm not mistaken, your government does
not have much use for women who have...

120
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:01,795
...consorted with the devils
of Western capitalism.

121
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,127
Come on.

122
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:07,362
Am I right?

123
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:03,524
Where have you been?

124
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:08,729
I'm sorry, Adam.
I know you're in a lot of pain.

125
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,894
Then why did you do this to me?

126
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:14,565
We were trying to give you
a second chance.

127
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:18,705
I've been hearing a lot of noise out there.
What's going on?

128
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:21,003
They're shutting down the lab.

129
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,007
Where are we going?

130
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:30,077
You're not taking me with you.

131
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:32,212
I can't.

132
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,716
What about the medicine?

133
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,625
Mr. Luthor took all of it.

134
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:43,195
Then get it back.

135
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:49,203
-I've only got 1 2 hours. You know that!
-He won't help you, Adam.

136
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:51,467
He doesn't even know you're alive.

137
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:54,203
I have no idea
where he's taking the serum.

138
00:11:55,781 --> 00:12:00,150
-I'm sorry.
-Then what am I supposed to do?

139
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:16,699
Look, Clark, I'm no expert on
quantum tunneling or wormholes...

140
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:20,964
...but if minds like Einstein and Thorne
believe time anomalies are possible...

141
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:22,367
...who am I to rule it out?

142
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,068
Lex, if that phone call is gonna happen
tonight, we need to find Adam.

143
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:29,946
Clark, what makes you think I can help?

144
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,842
Because you were at the lab.

145
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:35,609
And I know you met with Dr. Teng.

146
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:41,722
Clark, what have you been doing?

147
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:45,420
-Following me?
-Don't turn this around on me, LeX.

148
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:48,698
Look, we think Adam died of liver disease
a few months ago...

149
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:52,268
...and I'm guessing he was
one of Dr. Teng's subjects.

150
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,999
Lana's in trouble and I know
you're holding out on me.

151
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,771
Where is he, LeX?

152
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,312
You don't want anything
to happen to Lana.

153
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,548
I know you don't. Please.

154
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,924
Trust me, Clark.

155
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,532
There's no way Adam's
gonna come after Lana.

156
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,397
-How can you be so sure?
-Because he can't leave the lab.

157
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:29,166
He needs constant injections
just to stay alive.

158
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:34,709
I need to see it with my own eyes.

159
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,208
It's a secured lab.
You'll never be able to get in there.

160
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,511
Not without you.

161
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:51,783
LeX.

162
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,930
Adam's gone.

163
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,241
Was it worth it?

164
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:21,313
Sacrificing the lives of Dr. Teng
and all those technicians...

165
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,054
...just to get back into
the pharmaceutical business.

166
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:28,155
I hope you weren't as emotional
as this with the police.

167
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:30,988
I just spent the last five hours
covering for you.

168
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,566
I appreciate the gesture, but I told you,
I had nothing to do with the lab at Metron.

169
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:39,165
I suppose you didn't have anything
to do with those murders either.

170
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:43,904
LeX, even if I were the demonic father
you make me out to be...

171
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:46,737
...you know I would never
do anything so sloppy.

172
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,643
But I'm not worried, son.

173
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:55,146
How can you be so cavalier?

174
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,586
Because I know that I have someone
extremely competent in charge.

175
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,698
You wanted the project.

176
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,298
It's yours.

177
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,165
I'm trusting you to handle things.

178
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:26,813
Nice try, Dad.

179
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:29,317
But I'm not suiting up in the 1 1 th hour.

180
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:35,455
Clean up your own mess.

181
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:55,007
I thought I was used to seeing weird things
around here, but this was a massacre.

182
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,239
What about Adam?

183
00:16:57,415 --> 00:16:59,713
It looks like he escaped.

184
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:02,817
But you think he killed them.

185
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,923
He obviously escaped from his cell
and strangled his doctor.

186
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,616
Looks like the other victims
were trying to stop him.

187
00:17:08,793 --> 00:17:11,921
Hey, guys. So after I promised
to switch my long-distance service...

188
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:15,828
...I got the phone company to track down
the blocked number you called from.

189
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,534
Whose was it?

190
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:20,467
It's from a cell phone
belonging to Gwen Burton.

191
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,732
Does that ring a bell?

192
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:27,937
No. I have no idea who that is.

193
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:31,378
-Why would I make a call from her phone?
-I don't know.

194
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:35,713
But we can rack up one more for our "Can
you hear me 24 hours from now? " theory.

195
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:39,687
I looked into Mrs. Burton's phone records
and there were no outgoing calls last night.

196
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,918
It's like the call you received
came out of thin air.

197
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:45,822
Or a really different time zone.

198
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:48,998
Look, at least this gives us an advantage.

199
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:52,694
We know what's supposed to happen.

200
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:56,398
We have to keep Adam away from Lana
and make sure you don't get that phone.

201
00:17:56,574 --> 00:18:00,032
-But Adam could be anywhere.
-It's safer if we get you out to the farm.

202
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,315
Clark, what if we can't
stop this from happening?

203
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:22,396
Mrs. Burton?

204
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:25,695
This is a strange question,
but I work at the Teen Crisis Hotline...

205
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,067
...and we got a call from this number
last night. Is it yours?

206
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:33,008
I didn't make any calls last night.
Sorry, there must be some mistake.

207
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,543
Would you know an Adam Knight?

208
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,078
He used to be a patient here.

209
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:38,511
We don't get many patients
in Accounts Receivable.

210
00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:41,151
Look, Mrs. Burton,
I don't know how to eXplain this...

211
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:44,846
...but I think your phone's gonna be
used in a crime. Tonight.

212
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,021
-What did you say your name was?
-Clark Kent.

213
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,526
Clark, we have an excellent
psychiatric staff here.

214
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:53,823
I'd be happy to take you
to the admitting desk.

215
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,657
I know I sound crazy, but is there
a chance you lost your phone?

216
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:02,466
Actually, I lent it to my husband today.

217
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,336
He had to run some errands in Metropolis.

218
00:19:05,543 --> 00:19:08,478
Would you call him, please?

219
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:27,965
-Hello.
-Hi, honey...

220
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,567
...there's some kid here
asking about the cell phone.

221
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:32,464
What, they come in person now?

222
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:36,869
-Just tell him we're happy with our plan.
-Ask him where he is.

223
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:40,976
-Where are you?
-I'm stuck outside the city on Route 1 7.

224
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,670
I got a flat, but I should be--

225
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:46,046
Len?

226
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:48,947
Len? Len--

227
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,391
He's not answering.

228
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:18,078
Are you okay?

229
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,983
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-What happened?

230
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:24,053
Some kid just carjacked me.
He looked like a junkie.

231
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:25,712
Did you see which way he went?

232
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,595
No. I must have been out for a minute.

233
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,358
I need to call the police.

234
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:40,970
You don't have your cell phone, do you?

235
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,834
No.

236
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,093
Here you go, Lana.

237
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:08,824
I know this old house can get drafty
and I'm sure Mrs. Kent won't mind.

238
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,900
Thanks, Mr. Kent. I really appreciate it.

239
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:15,267
-Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'll tell them.
-What did Clark say?

240
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,069
He missed Adam by a few minutes
and Adam has the cell phone.

241
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,248
It's all starting to come true.

242
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:28,843
The storm.

243
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,885
The phone.

244
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:34,214
Don't you worry, Lana.

245
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:36,950
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

246
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:42,128
I'm not doing any good just standing here.

247
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,393
The police are looking
for the stolen vehicle.

248
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,299
Any leads are gonna come through
the scanner at the Torch.

249
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,168
Here, Chloe, I want you to take my truck.

250
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:53,704
The last thing we need is you
getting stuck in a creek.

251
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:55,106
Thank you.

252
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,649
Lana, it's gonna be okay. We've got lots
of time. The game hasn't even started yet.

253
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,426
Keep me posted.

254
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,688
Still no leads on Adam.

255
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,560
-What about the serum?
-What about it?

256
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:19,191
Adam knows it's keeping him alive.
He's gotta go after more of it.

257
00:22:19,537 --> 00:22:21,801
Problem is, there's no more serum
for him to find.

258
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:25,374
You know your father didn't get rid of it.
He must have a stash somewhere.

259
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:29,709
Detective Cage, Metropolis P.D.

260
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,247
We have a warrant to search the premises.

261
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,909
-On what grounds?
-Eight possible counts of negligent homicide.

262
00:22:36,554 --> 00:22:38,920
Why don't you take a load off.

263
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:42,185
We'll just make ourselves at home.

264
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:45,590
I'm sorry, Clark, but you better go.

265
00:22:46,664 --> 00:22:50,657
-I don't want you getting involved in this.
-Unfortunately, he already is.

266
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:53,599
Seeing as how Mr. Kent was
also at the scene of the crime...

267
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:56,501
...we'd like to ask
him a few questions too.

268
00:23:17,528 --> 00:23:20,258
-Where's Lana?
-I don't know. I'm not her keeper.

269
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:22,265
Don't lie to me.

270
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:25,925
I was just at the Talon, they said
you and Lana left together. Where is she?

271
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,938
Why do you care so much?

272
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:35,077
-She's got something that belongs to me.
-Well, it's obviously not here.

273
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:39,273
And if I were you, I wouldn't be either.
Everybody's looking for you.

274
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:49,149
Isn't that Clark's truck?

275
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,994
No, it's my cousin's.

276
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:57,334
Something tells me that's not
what the registration's gonna say.

277
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,797
You're covering for her.

278
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,537
Where is she?

279
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,109
Is she hiding at her old boyfriend's?

280
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,377
No!

281
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:13,749
Don't worry.

282
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:16,785
You'll be able to talk to her soon enough.

283
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:24,552
I'm sure when Mrs. Kent gets home
she'll whip you up one of her specialties.

284
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,527
-Until then, I'm afraid it's just black coffee.
-Thanks.

285
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:30,827
-I have some honey.
-No, I'm good.

286
00:24:33,671 --> 00:24:35,969
Sounds like my truck.

287
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,013
Yeah, it's Chloe.

288
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,548
Why isn't she coming inside?

289
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,118
I don't know.

290
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:56,020
Why don't you lock the door behind me.

291
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,479
Go back in the house!

292
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:24,545
-Please be careful, Mr. Kent. Please!
-Chloe?

293
00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:26,815
Mr. Kent! No!

294
00:25:37,468 --> 00:25:39,834
-Come on!
-Get away from me.

295
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,548
Lana! I know you're in there!

296
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,620
If you don't come out,
I'll kill your boyfriend's father!

297
00:25:58,422 --> 00:26:01,357
Then I'll move on to Chloe!

298
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,497
Adam!

299
00:26:06,664 --> 00:26:10,657
Whatever you want,
just don't hurt them any more!

300
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:23,011
-Please, just don't hurt them.
-Come on.

301
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,741
Just leave them alone, please. Oh, God.

302
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:30,013
Hurry up. Let's go.
Shut up and get in the truck.

303
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,997
You're gonna stand there and tell me
you weren't working with Dr. Teng?

304
00:26:40,164 --> 00:26:41,859
You can't deny you're behind this.

305
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,194
I'm the one who called the ambulance.

306
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:47,303
Now, why would I do that
if I was involved in those murders?

307
00:26:47,471 --> 00:26:51,202
Well, let's see what we got
in the goodie bag.

308
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,241
Nothing that will incriminate me.

309
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:05,287
Except some memo signed by you
as acting director of the lab.

310
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,663
-I've never seen these before.
-Amazing how that always happens.

311
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:18,665
-I'm being set up.
-Then they're doing a damn good job of it.

312
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,267
Take a breather.

313
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:24,408
Think about if you wanna
stick to that story.

314
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,372
You have to let me go.

315
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:30,742
Your friend's been running off at the mouth
for an hour fessing up...

316
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,315
-...so don't try and play the hero.
-You're bluffing.

317
00:27:33,484 --> 00:27:36,180
He didn't admit to anything
because he didn't do anything.

318
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:37,719
You really think that?

319
00:27:38,122 --> 00:27:40,852
You don't know your friend as well
as you think you do.

320
00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:45,327
Hey, Paul. The Vipers just took Roberts
off the court. He blew out his knee.

321
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:48,260
Guess who's off the bench
with five minutes in the fourth quarter.

322
00:27:48,432 --> 00:27:51,265
-Gunnerson.
-Yeah.

323
00:27:51,435 --> 00:27:54,768
That guy throws more bricks
than a mason.

324
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:57,737
-I have to go.
-Were we keeping you from something?

325
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,433
Have you called my parents yet?

326
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:01,405
Yeah, no one's answered.

327
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,570
The newspapers
would find it interesting...

328
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:07,149
...that a minor was being held
for questioning without his guardian.

329
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,980
I wouldn't take any long vacations.

330
00:28:11,155 --> 00:28:14,181
We may need to bring you in
for more questioning.

331
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,559
Damn.

332
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:28,061
Vipers lead 52 to 46 but the momentum....

333
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,140
Denali dribbles up the court,
passes to Weir in the low post.

334
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:37,907
Weir fakes right, he shoots,
but Armaganian takes it off the rim.

335
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:39,674
There's a long throw to Matthews--

336
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,944
-Which one is it?
-lt' s over here.

337
00:28:43,187 --> 00:28:46,748
Hurry up. Come on.

338
00:28:47,658 --> 00:28:49,455
Faster.

339
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,327
-I put everything in these boXes over here.
-Where are my books?

340
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:01,937
-I don't know which one I put them in.
-Well, look.

341
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:11,548
Hurry up.
I don't have a lot of time, Lana.

342
00:29:13,851 --> 00:29:16,115
The white one. The white one.

343
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,358
-Where is it?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

344
00:29:22,526 --> 00:29:25,461
I had three vials in there!
What did you do with them?

345
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:27,494
-I didn't touch them.
-You liar!

346
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:10,238
Takes it down for the Metros.
He cuts around Miller, goes up for two.

347
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,739
What happened?

348
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:14,742
I came home and found your father
and Chloe outside.

349
00:30:14,912 --> 00:30:16,243
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

350
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,712
Adam has Lana
and he has your dad's gun.

351
00:30:20,117 --> 00:30:22,745
The police are looking for him now.

352
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,855
-Do you know which way they headed?
-I don't know.

353
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:29,550
Adam keeps saying that Lana
has something of his.

354
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,523
-The serum.
-I don't know.

355
00:30:31,695 --> 00:30:34,687
He went to the Talon and the house.
I don't know where they'd go.

356
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:38,801
I'm going to the youth center. All we're
sure of is that Lana's gonna make that call.

357
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:41,403
Clark, what good is that?
You've heard the call.

358
00:30:41,572 --> 00:30:44,564
It was cutting in and out.
We could barely hear half of it.

359
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:48,439
If I figure out why it was placed to the past,
maybe I can stop it from happening.

360
00:30:48,612 --> 00:30:51,046
You think Lana will be able
to tell you where she is?

361
00:30:51,215 --> 00:30:54,343
--but he's blocked by Grier.
Boardner passes it out to Johnson.

362
00:30:54,518 --> 00:30:56,952
Johnson goes for the three-pointer
and he sinks it!

363
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,383
What's the score?

364
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:00,786
Vipers up by two, 61 to 59.

365
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:04,450
-There's three seconds left in the game.
-61 -59.

366
00:31:04,628 --> 00:31:06,357
Vipers.

367
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,227
Lana!

368
00:31:15,906 --> 00:31:17,931
Lana!

369
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:21,805
-Oh, damn it.
-Lana!

370
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:40,754
-Lana!
-Clark!

371
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:42,956
-Lana!
-Please, help me--

372
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,338
Clark, it's happening.

373
00:31:56,013 --> 00:32:01,178
-Three seconds left. Gunnerson dribbles....
-He's got a gun!

374
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:05,152
It's good! That makes the score
64 to 60, Vipers.

375
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:17,566
-Please help me!
-Lana! Lana!

376
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:37,714
Clark!

377
00:32:44,628 --> 00:32:47,426
Clark, why aren't you picking up?

378
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:59,169
Clark! He's trying to kill me!

379
00:32:59,343 --> 00:33:00,901
Please help me!

380
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,540
Clark!

381
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,678
Help me!

382
00:33:09,286 --> 00:33:11,550
-Please, help me!
-Lana!

383
00:33:11,722 --> 00:33:12,984
-Clark!
-You lied to me!

384
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:17,320
-Lana, where are you?
-I'm at Walcott Storage! Help me!

385
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:50,618
Lana?

386
00:33:52,796 --> 00:33:54,855
-Are you okay?
-Where's Adam?

387
00:34:09,446 --> 00:34:11,744
You took that bullet.

388
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,374
That's impossible.

389
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:15,916
I saw you.

390
00:34:18,055 --> 00:34:20,956
Now I know why Lionel sent me
to watch you.

391
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:25,357
Guess I found what I was looking for...

392
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,827
...just a little too late.

393
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,528
Adam.

394
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:34,595
He's not gonna stop, Clark.

395
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:38,271
I couldn't escape him.

396
00:34:39,276 --> 00:34:41,801
How long do you think you can?

397
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:20,783
-Let's go.
-FBl.

398
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:26,046
Why don't you boys hit the showers.
This case has been bumped up to varsity.

399
00:35:26,223 --> 00:35:28,748
That's just like you guys.

400
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:33,989
We do the heavy lifting
and you just show up for the prize.

401
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:40,463
This better be important.

402
00:35:40,904 --> 00:35:44,567
Your lawyer may have friends
in high places...

403
00:35:44,808 --> 00:35:47,971
...but I'm not a believer
in the trickle-down theory.

404
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:51,147
I wanna make a deal.

405
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:56,749
Why should I do that? I understand
they're building a strong case against you.

406
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,084
As flattered as I am to be the object
of so much attention...

407
00:36:01,258 --> 00:36:03,818
...you and I both know
I'm only the consolation prize.

408
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,996
-I'm listening.
-Tell the cops to drop the charges...

409
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:10,156
...and give me immunity...

410
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,761
...and I'll give you
the biggest arrest of your career.

411
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,101
What are we talking about?

412
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:28,043
I'll help you bring down my father.

413
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,856
I must admit, I'm intrigued by the research.

414
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:40,997
What happened to your
last project manager?

415
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,632
She...

416
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,791
...moved on.

417
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:48,361
And please understand me, Dr. Bergin...

418
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,942
...I will spare no eXpense on this project.

419
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,839
You onboard?

420
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:59,912
With the limited amount of serum you have,
there's barely enough for one round of trials.

421
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:04,144
Well, that's why I'm counting on you
to get it right the first time.

422
00:37:05,622 --> 00:37:11,583
Well, I suppose I could have a lab outfitted
and a trial underway within a year.

423
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:15,630
Dr. Bergin, I want you up and running
by the end of the week.

424
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:17,596
A project like this requires time.

425
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:21,135
Time is a luXury I don't have, doctor.

426
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,671
I have been...

427
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:27,709
...diagnosed with a rather unique...

428
00:37:28,345 --> 00:37:32,008
...Iiver disease and I'm out of options.

429
00:37:41,725 --> 00:37:43,522
Any luck?

430
00:37:44,194 --> 00:37:48,460
No. I.... I got lost at the first wormhole.

431
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:52,398
The world's scientists are still debating
over Einstein's theories of time travel.

432
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:55,402
I don't think we're gonna crack it
in one night.

433
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,441
Clark, there's still something
I don't understand.

434
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,978
How did you get from the hotline
to the storage unit in a split second?

435
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:09,116
Took me more than a few seconds.

436
00:38:11,755 --> 00:38:14,690
Maybe it had something to do
with the weird time anomaly.

437
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,762
You know, there's something
that I don't understand either.

438
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:25,459
Why did you call the hotline
instead of the police?

439
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,604
Because...

440
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,772
...I knew you'd be there.

441
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:36,902
Looks like we cheated fate.

442
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,308
Barely.

443
00:38:41,685 --> 00:38:44,153
I was so afraid that
I wouldn't get to you in time.

444
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:48,350
I know.

445
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:53,929
I spent the last 24 hours terrified
of what might happen.

446
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,189
But it all turned out okay.

447
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,796
It made me realize
how many decisions I make...

448
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,735
...because I'm scared
of how things will end up.

449
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,169
We both do our share of that.

450
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:16,082
Maybe it's time to stop being so afraid.

451
00:39:19,122 --> 00:39:25,220
I've always thought that my life
is so mapped out for me...

452
00:39:25,462 --> 00:39:29,023
...but, you know, maybe we have
more control over the future than we think.

453
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,000
