1
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:07,320
Hold nothing back!
Leave it all on the floor!

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,425
-How much time we got?
-We've got fifteen minutes tops!

3
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,424
Just enough time to get in and out!

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,421
All right, let's do this thing!

5
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,809
Are you ready now, Clark?

6
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:35,611
Yeah. I forgot to press
the record button. Sorry.

7
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:38,351
So, Mr. Luthor...

8
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:41,820
...any more secret construction
projects at LuthorCorp like Level 3?

9
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:43,652
Please, call me Lex.

10
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:46,662
-Lex, are you gonna answer my question?
-Chloe.

11
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,594
-What?
-It's okay, Clark.

12
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:52,326
"Our critics are our friends.
They show us our faults."

13
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:55,370
Benjamin Franklin.

14
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:57,497
Excuse me, Mr. Luthor...

15
00:00:57,674 --> 00:01:00,700
-...your father's on the phone.
-I need to get this.

16
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:05,113
I'll take it in the conservatory.

17
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:09,315
I look forward to resuming
our verbal judo.

18
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,793
-All right, boys, this is the big one!
-Yeah! Let's do it!

19
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:22,795
Let's go!

20
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:26,925
I wonder if he's really taking a call
or if he's just trying to avoid me?

21
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:29,367
Wow, that's really cool.

22
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:31,870
Do you think it's real?

23
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:39,073
Chloe?

24
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,810
Chloe.

25
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:52,653
Okay. The vault's in the wall
behind the bookcase.

26
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,525
-How do you know?
-I've got my sources.

27
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:59,532
-He was doing one of the housekeepers.
-Oh, yeah.

28
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:22,448
-We got five minutes, let's move it!
-Let's do it!

29
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:27,151
That's it, boys, come on. It's payday!

30
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,032
One minute!

31
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,146
-Come on, let's go!
-I only got one arm.

32
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,110
Yeah!

33
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:52,645
Time's up! Let's move it! Let's go!

34
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:55,556
You can't just go snooping
around someone's house.

35
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:59,889
Clark, it's a mansion.
It's designed for snooping.

36
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,721
Okay, fine.
We'll go and wait in the library...

37
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:06,357
...for Lex to officially blow us off.

38
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:10,532
-I'll put the camera away.
-Okay, I'm gonna go get my bag.

39
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,744
Hey, what's going on?

40
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:21,006
Chloe, run!

41
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:49,140
Move it! Let's move it!

42
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:51,002
Clark!

43
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:53,380
Chloe.

44
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,484
Clark!

45
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,352
Chloe!

46
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:21,229
Clark.

47
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,739
Don't worry, I brought in
the best doctors from Metropolis.

48
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,539
-Is she gonna be all right?
-Doctors aren't sure.

49
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:35,810
The fall was pretty bad. She broke
her left arm and has a concussion.

50
00:05:36,352 --> 00:05:38,718
They wanna make sure
there's no brain swelling.

51
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:41,516
I should've gotten to her.

52
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:45,457
I don't mean to belabor the obvious,
Clark, but this isn't your fault.

53
00:05:45,628 --> 00:05:49,359
I just don't know what happened.
One minute, the room is empty...

54
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:51,762
...and then they appear out of thin air.

55
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,528
I mean, do the police have any leads?

56
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:57,172
They don't think I'm the first one
that's been hit.

57
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,241
There have been over a dozen
robberies all over the county.

58
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,176
They tried to hit the
Smallville Savings & Loan.

59
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:08,977
I didn't hear about that.

60
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:12,485
Banks don't publicize attempted robberies,
it's bad for their image.

61
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:15,783
If nothing was taken,
how do they know they were robbed?

62
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,358
Apparently they tripped an alarm
inside the vault.

63
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:21,224
Although, no one knows
how they got in there.

64
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:24,625
And the stuff they stole from you.
Can the police trace it?

65
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,793
I didn't report anything stolen, Clark.

66
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:33,338
-Why not? I saw them walk out with bags.
-I don't care about that.

67
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:36,672
I just want to find the people
who did this to Chloe. When I do...

68
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:39,906
...I promise you,
they will be dealt with accordingly.

69
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,883
-What does that mean?
-It means you should let me worry about it.

70
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:47,489
Now, why don't you go home
and get some rest?

71
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:08,405
Whitney.

72
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:10,876
Hey, Whitney, wait up.

73
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:15,484
-Thought you're meeting me at the hospital.
-I'm sorry, I forgot. How's Chloe?

74
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:17,619
Better, but not out of the woods yet.

75
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:21,416
That's the thing with this town.
It'll always find a way to keep you down.

76
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:25,357
Whitney, what's wrong? Is it your dad?

77
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:28,962
No, it's nothing.
I've just got to go do inventory.

78
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:31,259
See you.

79
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:52,317
Hi, Clark. What are you doing?

80
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:56,622
-Trying to make myself useful.
-Hey, son...

81
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:58,954
...we need firewood, not toothpicks.

82
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:02,955
I know what you guys are gonna say:
It's not my fault.

83
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:07,432
-Lex already told me, so did Chloe's dad.
-They're right, Clark. You did your best.

84
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:09,730
-Chloe could've died.
-Son...

85
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,340
...becoming an adult means
learning difficult lessons...

86
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:16,569
...one of which is you can't save
everybody, no matter who you are.

87
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,941
You said you felt the effects
of the meteor rocks.

88
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:22,414
Yeah, I just don't know
where it was coming from.

89
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:26,946
Sometimes I just wish I could leave this
town and get away from the meteor rocks.

90
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,617
I'm sure that you will.
You'll get that chance.

91
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:34,126
But running away won't solve anything.

92
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,096
Don't hang around here
feeling sorry for yourself.

93
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,429
Go. See what you can find out.

94
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:02,655
I had no idea I stored
so much stuff in here.

95
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:06,454
-Will you hand me the tape, please?
-Yeah.

96
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:10,123
I still can't believe
you're selling this place, Nell.

97
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,359
I can't believe your sudden interest
in the place.

98
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:16,538
My parents met here.
This place means a lot to me.

99
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:18,469
I know, Lana...

100
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:22,668
...but one screen can't compete
with a multiplex. And the fact is...

101
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:26,645
...I wanna be able
to send you to any college you want.

102
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:33,446
Could you tell me who the buyer is?

103
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:37,286
Maybe I could talk to them.
See if they'd be willing to renovate.

104
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:41,955
It's Lex Luthor.

105
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:49,360
Lex said the people who hit the
mansion tried to rob this bank.

106
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:52,440
I've got three words for you:
official police investigation.

107
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:54,633
The police haven't done a thing.

108
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,541
There have been 12 robberies in the past
six months with the same freaky m.o.

109
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:01,512
No sign of entry, the jewels
and the cash just vanished.

110
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,620
Except for this place. Lex says that
they triggered an alarm inside the vault.

111
00:10:05,788 --> 00:10:09,554
-The question is, how'd they get inside?
-I don't know.

112
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:12,922
Now, stop channeling Chloe and come on.

113
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:25,832
Oh, no, not the Kent thousand-yard stare.

114
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:28,067
Clark! Come on, man.

115
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,737
I know you feel bad. I do too.

116
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:34,474
But we're not cops.

117
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:01,205
Nothing. Nada.

118
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:05,677
Not a single sidebar. A guy has got to miss
a hundred grand in cash and jewels.

119
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:08,013
Not Luthor, bro.

120
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:12,281
There is no telling how much
jack he's got stashed in that castle.

121
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:15,151
Cash, jewels, art, cars, you name it!

122
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:19,090
If we went downstairs, we would've found
the money pit where he swims in the stuff...

123
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,162
-...like that duck with the Irish accent.
-Uncle Scrooge.

124
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:26,131
-Yeah, yeah.
-He was Scottish, not Irish.

125
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,600
We don't have enough time. This stuff
doesn't last as long as it used to.

126
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:35,600
I know, I know.

127
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,008
I'm telling you, we need fresh blood.

128
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,672
-Yeah, but who can we trust?
-I don't know.

129
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:45,617
I think I know why Luthor
didn't file that robbery report.

130
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:48,747
Check this out.

131
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:54,853
The poster boy for Rogaine doesn't want
anyone to know he's tapped into...

132
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:58,561
...his daddy's computer system.

133
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:01,532
Maybe then we pay Luthor Junior
another visit, huh?

134
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:04,366
I think so.

135
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:10,969
I don't care.

136
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,840
If I wanted excuses, I'd call the police.

137
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:20,618
Yeah? Well, you're supposed to be the
best private security firm in Metropolis.

138
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,392
How'd you get in here?

139
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:28,894
The same way we did last time, bro.

140
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:36,603
-I'm calling the police.
-You didn't last time, and we know why.

141
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:40,199
We read the disk, Lex.

142
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:44,212
-What are you talking about?
-You're skimming money from your dad...

143
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,008
...to fund a project in Smallville.

144
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:51,017
That concerns a methane treatment plant.
It'll put our competitors out of business.

145
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:58,717
Methane plants don't need
particle accelerators.

146
00:12:58,894 --> 00:13:02,352
-What do you want?
-A million, cash.

147
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:07,569
If you try anything stupid,
even if you think a stupid thought...

148
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:10,069
...your disk is going to be uploaded
to the Internet...

149
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:14,801
...for all the world
and Big Daddy Lionel to see.

150
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:16,444
How do I reach you?

151
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:19,274
You don't. We reach you.

152
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:24,146
Now, turn around.

153
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,123
Wait there.

154
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:33,826
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

155
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:51,976
Hey, Whitney.

156
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:54,146
Whitney?

157
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:58,844
-Hey.
-I'm picking up a microwave for my mom.

158
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:02,583
You can pick it up at the back counter.

159
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,249
Is everything okay?

160
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:11,154
I bet you think it's just great
to live in Smallville your whole life.

161
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:15,667
-Take over the farm from dad.
-I'm not sure that's the life for me.

162
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:19,968
-Sometimes you don't have a choice.
-Whitney, you'll get out of here.

163
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:24,010
-You'll go further than anyone in town.
-I lost my scholarship, Kent.

164
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,176
I'm sorry.

165
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,213
Have you told Lana yet?

166
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,649
I am going to spend the rest of my life
in this store...

167
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:43,026
...develop a bad heart at fifty like my dad,
and become just another "remember him?"

168
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:48,901
I'm never getting out of Smallville.

169
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:51,301
Hey, man, you got these sneaks in a twelve?

170
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,168
Yeah.

171
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:02,474
You got a problem, bro?

172
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,516
No.

173
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:07,679
I'll go find this.

174
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,027
Hey...

175
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:21,999
-...aren't you Whitney Fordman?
-Yeah.

176
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,139
Wade Mahaney.

177
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:27,833
I saw you throw 300 yards against
Topeka last year. That was a great game.

178
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:31,875
I heard you were tracked
for a full ride to Kansas State.

179
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:36,882
-It didn't work out. Size twelve, right?
-Yeah. Thanks, buddy.

180
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,344
Man. Well, I know all about that.

181
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:44,788
Senior year I got sacked, blew out
my knee, had to have four operations.

182
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,120
Tough break.

183
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:49,025
I had a dozen schools offer me
full scholarships...

184
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,658
...and then it all went away,
just like that.

185
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:57,001
So, what's your plan now?

186
00:15:57,172 --> 00:16:01,700
Don't have one. Just don't want
to do this the rest of my life.

187
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:06,738
I hear you. Where's the future
in that, huh? Say...

188
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:09,317
...we're having a party
at our place tonight.

189
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:11,583
Why don't you swing by.

190
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:15,723
I can't, I've got to close up.

191
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:20,089
Come by after. Knock back a brew.
Detox from this.

192
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,628
Come on, man, it'll be fun.

193
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:28,499
Fun!

194
00:16:29,538 --> 00:16:32,336
I am the god of quarters.

195
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:41,816
Let me give you the tour, bro.
Come on.

196
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:47,516
-This place is awesome.
-Maybe we could bring you on, Fordman.

197
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,456
-Always use a talented guy.
-Why do you wanna help me?

198
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:53,652
Guys like us got to stick together.

199
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:56,855
I thought my life was over after football
didn't pan out.

200
00:16:57,032 --> 00:16:59,557
It was just beginning.

201
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:13,144
Trust me...

202
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:17,649
...it only gets better. Let me show you
where the real party is.

203
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:23,491
You ever been inked?

204
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:25,957
I'm not really into tattoos.

205
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,791
Initiation, bro.
First one's on the house.

206
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,661
I don't know, man, they're kind of forever.

207
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:37,738
-You wanna eat with the big dogs?
-You got to step up to the bowl.

208
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:43,673
This is like nothing
you've ever seen before.

209
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:47,373
Make you feel like a new man, swear to God.

210
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:49,779
Have a seat.

211
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:55,713
All right.

212
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:59,327
Just make sure
it doesn't say "Smallville."

213
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:36,491
Yeah, baby!

214
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,297
No! No!

215
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:48,499
-Hey! Hey, come on!
-Be the truck!

216
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:52,408
-Be the truck! Be the truck!
-You guys are crazy!

217
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:55,181
No!

218
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,484
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

219
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:08,061
-Yeah, baby!
-Yeah!

220
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,795
-Yeah.
-Yeah! You got it!

221
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:24,204
Hey.

222
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:27,047
Your dad called
and told me you were awake.

223
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,877
You're officially my first visitor.

224
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:33,852
How you feeling?

225
00:19:34,022 --> 00:19:38,152
Like a million bucks, thrown in
the washing machine and set on spin.

226
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:42,254
-Everyone was real worried about you.
-Yeah, I noticed.

227
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,264
Looks like Nell's flower shop's
been stripped clean.

228
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:48,830
I especially like the ones from Lex.

229
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:52,004
They make me feel like I won
the Kentucky Derby.

230
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:01,140
They're beautiful, Clark.
They're my favorite.

231
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:04,315
I....

232
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:06,920
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

233
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:10,658
For what?

234
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,326
Letting you get hurt.

235
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:17,954
Well, I am perturbed with you, Clark.

236
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,432
I'm also mad that you didn't put out
the Chicago Fire of 1871.

237
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:26,006
Or prevent the fall of the Roman Empire,
making you responsible for the Dark Ages.

238
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:30,838
Thanks.

239
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:36,683
Do you remember anything about those guys?

240
00:20:36,852 --> 00:20:41,346
There was one thing. The guy that
grabbed me had a tattoo on his forearm.

241
00:20:42,191 --> 00:20:44,557
An octagon, maybe.

242
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:48,585
-What's going on, Clark?
-I don't know.

243
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:51,289
Let me do some digging.

244
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:56,301
Clark Kent, investigative reporter.
Has a nice ring to it.

245
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,636
-You get some rest.
-I'll try.

246
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:09,981
Thank you.

247
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:15,750
This theater means something
to a lot of people.

248
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:20,020
I spent every Saturday of my childhood here,
eighth row center.

249
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,595
When the lights went down
and the screen flickered on...

250
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:26,598
...the problems outside these doors
just disappeared.

251
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:30,563
It was like being transported
to a magical place.

252
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:35,176
That's a nice story, but why is it
so important to you really?

253
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:43,412
My parents met here. I guess I'm just
looking for something to hold on to.

254
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:51,591
I'm supposed to preserve this monument
to Lana Lang's sentimental memories.

255
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,160
That's not what I meant.

256
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:59,028
You're a teenager, Lana.
Mercurial doesn't do you justice.

257
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:04,769
Thought you might understand.
Clearly I was mistaken.

258
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,771
This is business, Lana.

259
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:11,402
All these stores are becoming office spaces.
This town needs a parking garage.

260
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:14,741
So you're going ahead with your plans.

261
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,317
You haven't given me
any reason to change my mind.

262
00:22:18,987 --> 00:22:22,388
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a pressing matter to attend to.

263
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:36,467
Whitney, you have a minute?

264
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,801
I'm kind of busy.

265
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:44,005
Remember the guy who came in
yesterday, looking for shoes?

266
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:46,773
-No. A lot of guys come in here.
-Whitney, this is serious.

267
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:49,307
Take it easy.

268
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:54,486
-Where'd you get that tattoo?
-Mind your own business.

269
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:57,716
Look, did those guys give it to you?

270
00:22:58,994 --> 00:23:00,928
Whitney, they're bad news.

271
00:23:03,598 --> 00:23:08,365
You spend your time trying to steal Lana.
Now, you wanna become my Boy Scout.

272
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:10,698
That's not true.

273
00:23:10,872 --> 00:23:14,000
It's tough seeing yourself the way
others see you, isn't it, Kent?

274
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:18,579
-Stay away from those guys.
-You're not my father, Kent.

275
00:23:18,747 --> 00:23:21,682
Now, get the hell out of here.

276
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:39,859
Hey. Nell said you called.
Sounded urgent.

277
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:44,494
-Have you seen Whitney today?
-Yeah. I asked him what was going on.

278
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,471
He said he was out with some
new friends, blowing off steam.

279
00:23:47,642 --> 00:23:51,009
When I tried to press him,
he got angry, so I backed off.

280
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:57,080
It's hard watching people you love suffer
and there's nothing you can do to help.

281
00:23:58,153 --> 00:24:02,681
Lana, I don't know if I'm supposed to tell
you this, but Whitney lost his scholarship.

282
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,350
What?

283
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,587
Why didn't he tell me?

284
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:14,895
He was so close to his dream, and then
to just have it taken away like that.

285
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,697
Must hurt like hell.

286
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:19,733
Thanks for telling me.

287
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:22,433
You're a good friend.

288
00:24:28,183 --> 00:24:30,947
<i>I raided the Torch. I think these
are Whitney's new friends.</i>

289
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:35,389
Wade Mahaney and Scott Bowman.
Class of '96.

290
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:39,049
-Who are these guys?
-They were Whitney, six years ago.

291
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:43,459
Athletes, lettered in football, baseball,
basketball. They ruled the school.

292
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:47,633
<i>-What happened?
-Well, according to the Ledger...</i>

293
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:49,862
...Wade got injured
and Scott started using drugs.

294
00:24:50,172 --> 00:24:53,369
They watched their futures vanish.

295
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:57,240
-Do you think Whitney's in trouble?
-I don't know.

296
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,973
I tried to talk to him,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

297
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:04,414
He thinks that scholarship
is his only way out of here.

298
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:08,283
I wish he'd see himself the way I do.
There's more to him than football.

299
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:11,017
-He's lucky to have you.
-Yeah.

300
00:25:11,193 --> 00:25:12,888
Big influence I am.

301
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:16,394
Can't seem to convince anybody
to do anything today.

302
00:25:16,565 --> 00:25:19,090
Are you talking about the Talon?

303
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:23,226
I met with Lex, tried to make my case,
but he totally shot me down.

304
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:26,966
He said I hadn't given him
a good enough business reason.

305
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:29,007
Sounds kind of harsh.

306
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,471
Yeah.

307
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:35,173
But I think the thing that makes me
maddest, is that he's right.

308
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:39,815
Maybe it wasn't a rejection,
maybe it was a challenge.

309
00:25:39,988 --> 00:25:44,482
-My first challenge is helping Whitney.
-Let me work on that.

310
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:49,964
Clark, why are you doing this?
Not that I don't appreciate it.

311
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:54,830
I couldn't stop what happened to Chloe.
There's a chance for Whitney.

312
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:13,277
You got a taste.

313
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:16,720
You wanna find out
what it's all about, bro?

314
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:19,826
Yeah. Sure, I'm in.

315
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,978
<i>Glad you could make it, Luthor.</i>

316
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:46,553
<i>Go inside. You'll find
a walk-in meat locker.</i>

317
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:49,155
<i>Wait there.</i>

318
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:01,864
Now what?

319
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:05,231
Hello?

320
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,084
-How did you...?
-Open the case, Lex.

321
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:30,661
-I want the disk first.
-The money, Lex.

322
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:32,595
Give us the money!

323
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:34,064
-What's going on?
-Shut up.

324
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:46,213
It's empty. He screwed us!

325
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:51,250
-lf I brought the money, I'd never get out.
-Big mistake, rich boy.

326
00:27:53,355 --> 00:27:56,051
I phase through your neck, I kill you.

327
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,087
-We want the damn money!
-Stop it!

328
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,593
-Give us the money!
-You never said we'd do this!

329
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,459
I said, shut up!

330
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,628
Stop it, you're killing him!

331
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,734
Wade, time is almost up, we got to blow!

332
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:13,169
Next time, bring the money!

333
00:28:29,658 --> 00:28:32,024
Whitney?

334
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,596
Come on, rookie.

335
00:28:48,777 --> 00:28:51,541
What got into you, bro?
What were you thinking?

336
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:54,705
-He wasn't thinking!
-I didn't sign on to kill anyone.

337
00:28:55,116 --> 00:28:56,743
Oh, is that it, Fordman?

338
00:28:56,918 --> 00:28:59,546
-You trying to quit?
-I'm not saying that. It's just....

339
00:29:00,855 --> 00:29:04,723
Luthor doesn't seem like the kind of guy
that would just pay up and then walk away.

340
00:29:04,893 --> 00:29:08,920
Don't worry about Luthor,
I put the fear of God in him!

341
00:29:09,097 --> 00:29:11,998
It's gonna be our biggest payday yet!

342
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,692
All right, all right,
all right, that's enough.

343
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:16,530
Homeboy's fine.

344
00:29:16,705 --> 00:29:19,173
-Just had a case of jitters, didn't you?
-Yeah.

345
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,035
Yeah.

346
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,315
-He's gonna screw everything up!
-Look at us, bro, we are burning up!

347
00:29:30,485 --> 00:29:34,819
We can't just keep tatting up. We need
fresh blood to keep this dream alive.

348
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:39,356
Now go get a brew and chill out.

349
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,927
Come on.

350
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:52,470
Listen, bro.

351
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,131
I went out on a limb for you just now.

352
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,609
Don't let me down again.

353
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,447
I won't.

354
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:05,444
And don't sweat Luthor.

355
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,919
As soon as he ponies up the cash,
I think he's gonna disappear...

356
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:12,025
...for a very long time.

357
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,363
Come on.

358
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:28,865
All right, Lex...

359
00:30:29,043 --> 00:30:31,841
...what were you doing with those guys?

360
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:36,379
They were blackmailing me, Clark.

361
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:39,349
I went there to make a drop.

362
00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:45,050
You're wondering if your father's
been right about me all along, aren't you?

363
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:49,455
They stole a computer disk
that contains confidential information.

364
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:52,099
-What was on it?
-Nothing illegal...

365
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,667
...but it's not something
I want in the public domain.

366
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:59,563
-That's why you didn't want cops involved.
-Clark, I told you I'd handle it.

367
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:02,039
Question is, what were you doing there?

368
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,035
I was following Whitney.

369
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:06,646
He's been hanging with those guys.
I wanted to help.

370
00:31:06,815 --> 00:31:09,409
Is this because of Chloe?

371
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:12,710
Clark, you can't save the world.

372
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:15,822
All you'll end up with is
a messiah complex and a lot of enemies.

373
00:31:16,524 --> 00:31:19,584
I saved you, didn't I?
That turned out all right.

374
00:31:23,264 --> 00:31:24,595
What's your next move?

375
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:29,229
They're gonna learn
that it doesn't pay to rob Lex Luthor.

376
00:31:29,404 --> 00:31:31,065
What about Whitney?

377
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,635
A man is measured
by the quality of his friends.

378
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:38,040
If the quarterback's with them,
he'll have to face the consequences.

379
00:31:57,298 --> 00:31:59,027
Pete?

380
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:01,593
<i>We were supposed to meet at the Torch.</i>

381
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:03,703
Yeah, well, Chloe called...

382
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,536
-...and I told her what we were doing....
-So I insisted you guys come here.

383
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:10,735
-You should be resting.
-All this resting is driving me insane.

384
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:15,246
These so-called "health-care professionals"
just want me in bed eating Jell-O.

385
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,316
Those fascists.

386
00:32:19,053 --> 00:32:21,783
I need to do this, okay?
Don't cut me out of it, please?

387
00:32:22,123 --> 00:32:23,112
Okay.

388
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:26,456
So I was surfing the Net,
doing some research....

389
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:28,562
How'd you get online here?

390
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,665
Pete hijacked the phone line for me.

391
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:35,925
What have you got?

392
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:39,596
What if these guys are using meteorite
tattoos to speed up their metabolism?

393
00:32:39,841 --> 00:32:43,436
I mean, their molecules
are literally moving at hyperspeed.

394
00:32:44,245 --> 00:32:47,806
-That's how they go through solid objects?
-That's crazy.

395
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:50,678
Well, they're doing it.

396
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:52,452
It's like the ultimate rush.

397
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,454
But there's no way their bodies
can handle that kind of stress for long.

398
00:32:56,624 --> 00:32:58,353
What are you saying will happen?

399
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,919
You take the ultimate rush,
you pay the ultimate price.

400
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:12,063
Nell?

401
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:15,475
Nell, is that you?

402
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:24,816
Whitney.

403
00:33:24,986 --> 00:33:27,216
I'm in trouble, Lana.

404
00:33:27,388 --> 00:33:28,980
I messed up.

405
00:33:29,157 --> 00:33:30,818
I trusted the wrong guys.

406
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,083
I'm sorry.

407
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,320
I let you down.
I just don't know what to do.

408
00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:39,891
It's okay. It's okay.

409
00:33:49,477 --> 00:33:52,071
After they get the money,
they're gonna kill Lex...

410
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:53,975
...and probably me for betraying them.

411
00:33:54,148 --> 00:33:56,912
-You did the right thing.
-Yeah, too little too late.

412
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:58,575
Where are they now?

413
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,188
Back at the loft, sleeping it off.

414
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:05,793
-Did you see the disk they stole from Lex?
-No.

415
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:08,259
But it's gotta be there.
I can sneak in and get it.

416
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:11,999
-It's dangerous. We should call the police.
-No cops.

417
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:14,691
-I'm already in enough trouble.
-Tell me where they are.

418
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:19,966
-I can get in and out before they wake.
-I can't let you go alone, Clark.

419
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,535
I got myself into this mess,
I gotta try and get myself out of it.

420
00:34:36,691 --> 00:34:38,852
Empty. They must be out looking for me.

421
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:42,258
Well, let's find it before they come back.

422
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,607
It's not here.

423
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:58,644
Keep looking.
It's gotta be here somewhere.

424
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,391
I got it.

425
00:35:28,843 --> 00:35:31,607
You really screwed up, rookie.

426
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:43,012
Look, I don't know how you found
that disk, bro, but I need it back. Now.

427
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,370
Hurts, doesn't it? It feels like someone's
chewing up your insides.

428
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:07,310
I stay in long enough,
I could do some serious damage.

429
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,893
You're next, bro.

430
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,667
Wade, please.

431
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:38,277
Keep moving, rookie.

432
00:36:44,652 --> 00:36:47,917
I know what happened to your arm
in the bank vault.

433
00:36:48,856 --> 00:36:52,155
Occupational hazard.
We waited too long.

434
00:36:52,326 --> 00:36:55,659
Didn't hurt. When I pulled out,
it was fused at the shoulder.

435
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:58,321
You can't keep doing this.
You're gonna die.

436
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:03,061
If you hadn't have screwed up
our retirement plan, we wouldn't have to!

437
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:04,966
But now...

438
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,664
...you're gonna pay.

439
00:37:12,713 --> 00:37:15,011
-How'd you find us?
-Lana called...

440
00:37:15,183 --> 00:37:18,152
...told me what you guys were doing.
You should've called me first.

441
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,617
-I've gotta find Whitney.
-Clark, wait.

442
00:37:20,788 --> 00:37:23,154
I'm calling the police.

443
00:37:33,534 --> 00:37:35,229
I thought you understood.

444
00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:37,268
This was your chance to be on top again.

445
00:37:37,438 --> 00:37:40,703
I thought my life was over when
I lost my scholarship, but I was wrong.

446
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:44,038
No. You were right, your life is over.

447
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,781
Remember your initiation, bro?
That's how you joined us.

448
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:52,181
Well, that's how you're gonna leave.
We're running out of time, grab the remote.

449
00:37:55,156 --> 00:37:57,249
Let him go.

450
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,559
The cops are on their way.

451
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:09,397
Think again, rookie.
There's only one way off this team.

452
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,162
Don't worry, I got you covered.

453
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,677
Yeah!

454
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,929
Don't move!

455
00:38:40,268 --> 00:38:43,237
-Keep your hands up!
-Keep them up!

456
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:49,509
Up against the car!

457
00:38:55,283 --> 00:38:58,013
What did you tell the police?

458
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,482
The truth.

459
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:04,824
Those guys broke into my house. You two
figured it out, tried to be heroes...

460
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:06,857
-...and got in over your heads.
-What about--?

461
00:39:07,028 --> 00:39:08,859
Walking through walls part?

462
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:12,591
I don't think the cops could handle
that much truth.

463
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,663
Sorry about your disk.

464
00:39:16,537 --> 00:39:20,633
I didn't come out here for that, Clark.
I came because my friend was in trouble.

465
00:39:22,343 --> 00:39:24,470
Thanks.

466
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,018
Just remember, boys:

467
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:44,631
You keep my secret, and I'll keep yours.

468
00:39:50,938 --> 00:39:52,633
And if you don't...

469
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:56,106
...you'll find out you're not the only ones
who can reach through walls.

470
00:39:57,712 --> 00:40:00,112
Move this vehicle.
We have to transport the suspects.

471
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:01,441
Yes, sir.

472
00:40:03,617 --> 00:40:08,054
-Ah, the sweet smell of freedom.
-You were in the hospital, not Alcatraz.

473
00:40:08,222 --> 00:40:11,555
You spend a week in there and you'd feel
like a prisoner too. Come on.

474
00:40:11,726 --> 00:40:14,923
Bad food, lights out by nine and no cable?

475
00:40:15,096 --> 00:40:17,229
I'm thinking about doing an expose.

476
00:40:20,101 --> 00:40:23,366
-How's Whitney, by the way?
-He's taking it one day at a time.

477
00:40:23,537 --> 00:40:26,995
Good. All right, well, bye.

478
00:40:27,274 --> 00:40:29,936
-Oh, sorry.
-Chloe, where are you going?

479
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,479
I'm gonna do some checking
with the police.

480
00:40:32,646 --> 00:40:34,705
None of the tattoo ink
was found at the loft...

481
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:37,442
...and Scott and Derek aren't
saying anything to anyone, so....

482
00:40:37,618 --> 00:40:39,176
I smell a cover-up.

483
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,514
Chloe?

484
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,054
It's good to have you back.

485
00:40:43,724 --> 00:40:45,783
Thanks.

486
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:52,060
He's early.

487
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:54,526
Okay, here goes nothing.

488
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,602
It's a good plan.

489
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:59,365
Thanks for all your help. Wish me luck.

490
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,835
You don't need it.

491
00:41:10,651 --> 00:41:13,245
Thanks for coming.

492
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:15,585
I was surprised by your call.

493
00:41:15,756 --> 00:41:18,657
After our last meeting,
I didn't think I'd hear from you again.

494
00:41:18,826 --> 00:41:21,420
This time I came prepared.

495
00:41:22,863 --> 00:41:24,330
What's this?

496
00:41:24,832 --> 00:41:27,323
My business proposal.

497
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:30,197
Small towns across the country
have revived their downtowns...

498
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:33,704
...returning them to the social centers
they once were. They didn't do this...

499
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:36,206
...by building cookie-cutter malls
or parking garages.

500
00:41:36,377 --> 00:41:39,505
They did it by restoring the great
buildings that were already there...

501
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,841
...turning them into cafes,
bookstores, restaurants.

502
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:45,247
You want to turn the Talon
into a cafe/bookstore?

503
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:48,252
It could also be a venue
for local bands and arthouse movies.

504
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,186
I found out you can
register the building...

505
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:54,589
...as a historic landmark,
which gives you certain tax benefits.

506
00:41:55,196 --> 00:41:58,597
Just don't ask me to explain them.

507
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,391
Who's gonna manage it?

508
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:03,662
Nell said she'd be interested.

509
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:07,865
And I can train with her after school,
and try running it myself in the summers.

510
00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:10,772
How'd you come up with this?

511
00:42:11,045 --> 00:42:14,276
Something Clark said.
He told me you like to challenge people.

512
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,973
Well, you've definitely risen
to the challenge.

513
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,813
So it's a deal?

514
00:42:19,987 --> 00:42:23,684
I need to look over
everything but, yeah...

515
00:42:23,858 --> 00:42:26,122
-...it's a deal.
-Really?

516
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:28,155
Really.

517
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:32,322
I think this could be the start
of a very interesting partnership.

518
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:30,846
