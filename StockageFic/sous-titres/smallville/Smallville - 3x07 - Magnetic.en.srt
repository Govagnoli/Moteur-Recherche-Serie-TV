1
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,828
How tasteless is this?
I think they even used real meteor rock.

2
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:35,470
The American version of closure.

3
00:00:35,638 --> 00:00:37,265
You can only get over your grief...

4
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,567
...when you can
merchandise your tragedy.

5
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:42,405
Cotton candy.
Come on.

6
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:45,475
Hi. One cotton candy, please.

7
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:49,276
Sometimes I think it'd be nice
to get away from all this.

8
00:00:49,452 --> 00:00:52,615
Maybe Clark was right.
Just leave it all behind.

9
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:56,054
We almost went an entire day without
mentioning our favorite farm boy.

10
00:00:56,226 --> 00:00:59,252
Sorry. I didn't mean to throw
a wet towel over our girls' day out.

11
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:01,761
It's okay. I just feel I should
take this moment...

12
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:03,922
...to state something very obvious.

13
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:08,101
Clark not dating you
was his loss, not yours.

14
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:10,831
-Okay?
-Lana Lang. Hey!

15
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:13,639
Lana Lang, you wanna
show off your arm?

16
00:01:14,077 --> 00:01:17,069
-Amaze and astound your friends?
-Sure, why not?

17
00:01:18,615 --> 00:01:20,742
I'll let you in on a little secret too.

18
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:22,509
The game's rigged.

19
00:01:23,686 --> 00:01:27,782
Magnets. Just get it close,
I'll slip you a prize.

20
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:32,155
-Won't you get in trouble for that?
-No, it's the last day of the fair.

21
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:34,159
What are they gonna do?

22
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:37,995
I rest my case.

23
00:01:38,168 --> 00:01:39,829
Seth is my lab partner.

24
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:42,904
Yeah, and he's also had
a crush on you for forever.

25
00:01:43,072 --> 00:01:47,008
Isn't he the one who used to
spell your name out with spaghetti?

26
00:01:47,177 --> 00:01:53,047
That was in sixth grade. Now he's into,
like, cars, comics and GameCubes.

27
00:01:53,216 --> 00:01:55,116
What exactly do we have in common?

28
00:01:55,285 --> 00:01:56,547
I don't know.

29
00:01:58,955 --> 00:02:00,752
He's cute, though.

30
00:02:01,558 --> 00:02:03,822
Why not?
Expand your horizons.

31
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:05,483
-Go for it.
-All right.

32
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:18,096
-Aim. Aim.
-I am aiming!

33
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:21,633
I give up.

34
00:02:22,145 --> 00:02:23,976
Here.

35
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:27,181
For a fine effort.

36
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:29,976
Oh, Seth, l....

37
00:02:30,353 --> 00:02:31,786
You don't like it?

38
00:02:33,823 --> 00:02:37,987
-I'll take it.
-I'm sorry, sir, but you have to win first.

39
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:39,856
Oh, yeah? Like her?

40
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:45,393
I think you should...should leave.

41
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:48,163
Yeah?

42
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:50,131
I'd like to see you make me.

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,768
Here, just take it and leave him alone.

44
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:56,434
You gonna let your chick
do your fighting for you?

45
00:02:56,846 --> 00:02:59,314
Come on, punk.
What you got?

46
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:05,918
I'm gonna tear you apart!

47
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:07,420
Get security.

48
00:03:38,855 --> 00:03:41,255
Seth, oh, my God.
Someone call an ambulance!

49
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:44,954
Seth?

50
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:53,299
Okay, Seth, just relax,
and try not to move.

51
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:55,596
I'm feeling a little
claustrophobic in here.

52
00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:58,900
That's completely normal.
I'm about to turn on the MRI.

53
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:02,511
You're gonna hear some noises,
and we'll be done before you know it.

54
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:05,709
What' s that? What' s happening?
Is that normal?

55
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:09,909
It's just the magnetic field being
activated. Nothing to worry about.

56
00:04:13,756 --> 00:04:16,657
Help! Help!

57
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:19,289
Hold on!

58
00:04:33,242 --> 00:04:34,903
I need a nurse in here now!

59
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,612
Relax.

60
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:45,050
I need some help in here!
Stat!

61
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:50,951
Seth, what happened?
Are you okay?

62
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:01,400
Chloe was right.

63
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:06,272
You really are cute.

64
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:04,256
TB records?

65
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:05,867
I'm a little confused.

66
00:06:06,035 --> 00:06:09,596
I asked you to look into the tenement
fire that killed my grandparents...

67
00:06:09,772 --> 00:06:13,230
...and you brought me the history of
my father's childhood inoculations.

68
00:06:13,876 --> 00:06:15,434
Hey, these things take time.

69
00:06:15,611 --> 00:06:17,772
Especially when you're
billing by the hour.

70
00:06:17,947 --> 00:06:20,507
Yeah, well, the information I pulled...

71
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:23,385
...it's not the records that are important.

72
00:06:23,586 --> 00:06:26,350
It's the list of the individuals
who've accessed them.

73
00:06:26,522 --> 00:06:30,925
Turns out I'm not the only one
looking into the Luthor family history.

74
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:06,852
Hey.

75
00:07:08,564 --> 00:07:12,159
Either you're really excited about your
Jell-O, or you're feeling better.

76
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:14,166
I feel great, actually.

77
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:17,431
-Yeah, your cut looks amazing.
-Yeah.

78
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:21,167
You should see the MRl machine.
It's a TKO.

79
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:23,344
Yeah, do they know what happened?

80
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:26,606
I guess something interfered
with the magnetic field.

81
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:29,376
Must've just been
an old machine, I guess.

82
00:07:30,753 --> 00:07:34,382
Sorry for ruining your day at the fair.
Thanks for bringing me to the hospital.

83
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:36,218
I was happy to help.

84
00:07:41,063 --> 00:07:43,827
You know,
I'd really like to make it up to you.

85
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,764
Maybe take you out sometime?

86
00:07:48,638 --> 00:07:50,697
Seth, you don't have to.

87
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:02,744
Well, okay.

88
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:04,750
How about tonight?

89
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:15,361
Clark, what's the rush?

90
00:08:15,765 --> 00:08:18,029
You're not upset that Seth
asked me out, are you?

91
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:20,135
No. It's great.

92
00:08:20,303 --> 00:08:26,264
I'm glad you think so. Because last time
I checked, you and I were just friends.

93
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:33,371
Lana, it's fine.
Really, it's no problem.

94
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:38,319
I just....
I gotta go.

95
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:07,245
-Hello, sweetheart.
-Hi, baby.

96
00:09:08,084 --> 00:09:12,145
Something must be wrong if he
didn't eat the last piece of cherry pie.

97
00:09:13,222 --> 00:09:14,849
It's nothing.

98
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:16,582
It's just Lana.

99
00:09:17,793 --> 00:09:19,385
Seth Nelson asked her out.

100
00:09:19,729 --> 00:09:20,991
What did she say?

101
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:25,026
She said yes so fast,
it gave me whiplash.

102
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:29,367
Look, Clark, jealousy is a tough emotion.

103
00:09:29,538 --> 00:09:30,800
Dad, I'm not jealous.

104
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:34,739
Maybe a little bit...

105
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,435
...but he asked her out
on a date right in front of me.

106
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:40,377
I just find it
hard to believe she'd say yes.

107
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,111
Clark, you made a really tough
decision, son.

108
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:49,955
You didn't want to endanger Lana,
but you can't have it both ways.

109
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:52,117
If you're not willing
to go out with Lana...

110
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:55,321
...she's perfectly free
to go out with whoever she wants.

111
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:58,733
I guess you have to accept it.

112
00:10:04,006 --> 00:10:05,906
I didn't think you were gonna show.

113
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:09,909
Not that Clark Kent ever operates on
the same speed as the rest of the world.

114
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,105
-lnteresting observation, Chloe.
-Hey, Lex.

115
00:10:13,282 --> 00:10:15,648
Clark's not here.
Obviously.

116
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:17,410
Actually, I was looking for you.

117
00:10:20,556 --> 00:10:24,048
It's come to my attention that
you've been checking into my father.

118
00:10:25,695 --> 00:10:28,459
I saw your name on the
Metropolis County Records log.

119
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:33,159
Oh, yeah, that. I'm just writing
a story on him for the Torch.

120
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:38,330
Oh, really? A story that involves
obscure childhood medical records?

121
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:42,238
-Just trying to be thorough.
-The mark of a good reporter.

122
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:44,745
And you are a good reporter, Chloe.

123
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:49,344
So good
that my father pulled strings...

124
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:52,919
...to make you the youngest columnist
in the history of the Daily Planet.

125
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:54,386
What do you want, Lex?

126
00:10:54,557 --> 00:10:56,047
I'm just curious.

127
00:10:56,225 --> 00:11:00,685
Wondering why a high school reporter is
digging so deeply into my father's past.

128
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,561
Maybe I'll just ask him
about it at dinner tonight.

129
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:09,204
Go ahead, since the only way
you could've found out...

130
00:11:09,372 --> 00:11:12,068
...about those records
is if you looked into them yourself.

131
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:14,903
At least I'm prepared
for what I might find.

132
00:11:15,244 --> 00:11:18,611
I'm not so sure you realize
what you've gotten yourself into.

133
00:11:40,336 --> 00:11:41,701
Lana.

134
00:11:44,907 --> 00:11:47,341
I owe you an apology.

135
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,671
It did bother me
when Seth asked you out.

136
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:56,985
But I have to get used to the idea that
you're gonna be dating other people.

137
00:12:00,156 --> 00:12:05,059
I'm sorry too, Clark. I didn't mean
for that to happen right in front of you.

138
00:12:06,362 --> 00:12:11,095
Truthfully, I don't even know why
I agreed to go out with Seth.

139
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:15,668
Maybe I was just subconsciously
trying to make you jealous.

140
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:21,001
So you're not really into him.

141
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:25,542
He's a nice enough guy, it's just....

142
00:12:26,816 --> 00:12:28,875
There aren't any sparks.

143
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:33,011
He's gonna be here any second
to pick me up.

144
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:38,823
Lana, I know I should stay out of it...

145
00:12:38,994 --> 00:12:43,021
...but if you don't feel that way
about Seth, it's not right to lead him on.

146
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:44,831
Lana?

147
00:12:46,602 --> 00:12:50,368
-Hey. Ready to go?
-Seth, hi.

148
00:12:55,244 --> 00:12:57,178
Maybe we should sit down.

149
00:12:59,315 --> 00:13:00,612
Yeah.

150
00:13:07,323 --> 00:13:09,223
I don't know how to say this.

151
00:13:11,026 --> 00:13:13,654
I know I said I could go with you...

152
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:15,692
...but I can't.

153
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,697
I really am sorry.

154
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:22,764
It's no problem.

155
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:26,138
It's just that
you're always so busy, you know?

156
00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:30,739
You owe it to yourself to take a break...

157
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:33,605
...have a little bit of fun.

158
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:39,416
You know what?
You're right.

159
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:41,749
I'd love to go out with you.

160
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,656
-Could you cover me?
-Sure, no problem.

161
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:59,398
Seth, what are we doing here?
The fair's closed for the season.

162
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:02,772
It is, but they don't take the rides away
for a few more days.

163
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:04,776
And how are we supposed to get in?

164
00:14:06,448 --> 00:14:07,915
Turn around. It's a surprise.

165
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:22,554
How did you do that?

166
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:26,597
I guess the no-peeking rule
wasn't really clear.

167
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:28,737
Can you keep a big secret?

168
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:31,129
What do you mean?

169
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:34,807
You know after that guy hit me
and I went to the hospital?

170
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:37,241
I all of a sudden
got these strange powers.

171
00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:40,314
It's like I could warp
an electromagnetic field.

172
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:47,251
After the MRl I could move metal objects
like a magnet.

173
00:14:47,423 --> 00:14:48,788
Can you do it all the time?

174
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:54,491
Only when I concentrate.

175
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:57,527
Am I scaring you?

176
00:14:58,634 --> 00:15:01,626
Maybe in the past you would be...

177
00:15:03,072 --> 00:15:05,563
...but actually, I think it's kind of cool.

178
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:09,573
Thanks for not thinking I'm a freak.

179
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:11,713
Thanks for being honest with me.

180
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,575
It really means a lot.

181
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:28,819
You're amazing.

182
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:31,456
Let's go.

183
00:15:46,248 --> 00:15:49,183
-I love this ride.
-Yeah, me too.

184
00:15:50,252 --> 00:15:53,779
Reminds me that there's a world
out there beyond Smallville.

185
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:55,617
I'm gonna leave one day.

186
00:15:56,992 --> 00:15:59,085
I can't believe
you're here with me...

187
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:02,962
...even though I've always thought
we've had a connection, you know?

188
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,284
Yeah, me too.

189
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:26,883
I never realized it was this strong.

190
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:37,155
I'm sorry.

191
00:16:39,468 --> 00:16:42,096
I'm moving too fast.
I'll stop.

192
00:16:44,707 --> 00:16:48,040
Oh, my God!
Seth, you're crazy.

193
00:16:53,282 --> 00:16:57,343
Seth, what's going on?
You're making me nauseous.

194
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:06,924
Clark, what are you doing here?

195
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:08,620
I heard screaming.

196
00:17:08,797 --> 00:17:10,958
I thought you were in trouble
so I pulled the switch.

197
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:13,328
What switch?
I didn't hear the motor go off.

198
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:17,100
Do you always come to the fair
when it's closed, Clark?

199
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:20,538
Did you follow us here?

200
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:25,107
Are you stalking me?

201
00:17:26,482 --> 00:17:28,541
Better find a new hobby, Clark.

202
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:37,892
-You actually dated that loser?
-Yeah.

203
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,802
Nice trick.

204
00:17:52,975 --> 00:17:55,808
Haven't you got anything better to do
than follow me around?

205
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:58,640
You can control metal objects,
can't you, Seth?

206
00:17:58,814 --> 00:18:02,511
-So what if I can?
-And you've got some kind of hold on Lana.

207
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:05,578
Hate to poke a hole
in your little theory, Clark.

208
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:07,847
Lana's not made out of steel.

209
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:12,154
I don't know how you're doing it, but l
won't let you force Lana to be with you.

210
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:14,295
I'm not forcing her to do anything.

211
00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:18,900
I'm persuasive and she's on the rebound.
It's not my fault you blew it, Clark.

212
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:20,898
She's not into you, Seth.

213
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:23,166
Could've fooled me.

214
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:25,636
Look, Lana's all I've ever
thought about, okay?

215
00:18:25,808 --> 00:18:27,673
And now she's mine, so deal with it.

216
00:18:27,843 --> 00:18:30,869
I'm warning you, Seth.
Stay away from Lana.

217
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:33,879
And I'm warning you, leave us alone.

218
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:37,044
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

219
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:56,164
So you think that the
meteor flakes from the snow globe...

220
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:59,102
...plus the MRl, equals Magnet Boy?

221
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:03,336
Well, assuming we can prove that Seth
can manipulate metal with his mind...

222
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:07,073
...what does that have to do with
Lana's sudden Seth infatuation?

223
00:19:07,249 --> 00:19:10,514
Her attraction to him
has something to do with the accident.

224
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:13,549
Or Lana could just think he's really hot.

225
00:19:13,722 --> 00:19:17,852
Seriously. I know you don't want to
admit it, but it's possible she likes him.

226
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:20,893
-Chloe, they have nothing in common--
-What are you doing?

227
00:19:21,063 --> 00:19:23,554
He's been around,
but they barely know each other.

228
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:29,603
Well, except for the past two years,
you could be describing yourself.

229
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:31,136
I found it.

230
00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:36,709
Look at this.

231
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:40,144
The electromagnetic activity in Seth
is higher after the MRl.

232
00:19:40,315 --> 00:19:43,250
Well, that explains
the walking magnet theory.

233
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:45,045
Why didn't the doctors flag it?

234
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,745
According to this,
they chalked it up to an accident.

235
00:19:47,923 --> 00:19:50,517
They're gonna keep an eye on him
for a few weeks.

236
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:52,250
Let's head back to the Torch...

237
00:19:52,427 --> 00:19:56,124
...so we can check up on the effects
of electromagnetism in the body.

238
00:20:02,271 --> 00:20:03,670
What's going on?

239
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:05,968
What are you two doing in here?

240
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:11,812
Nothing.

241
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:15,982
Sorry, we were just taking a break
from candy-striping.

242
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:18,312
This is a hospital, young lady.

243
00:20:18,487 --> 00:20:20,455
Volunteering is about helping patients...

244
00:20:20,622 --> 00:20:23,455
...not about makeout sessions
in the file room, okay?

245
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,058
Okay.

246
00:20:27,863 --> 00:20:30,127
A good reporter
always thinks on her feet.

247
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:45,641
Lana.

248
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,749
I heard you warned Seth
to stay away from me.

249
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:55,322
First you follow us
to the fair, and now this?

250
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,982
-Who do you think you are, Clark?
-Lana, I had to.

251
00:20:59,161 --> 00:21:02,392
Seth is different.
He was affected by the MRl.

252
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:06,059
-lt somehow made him magnetic.
-I know that, Clark.

253
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:08,534
Seth showed me.

254
00:21:08,704 --> 00:21:12,196
He's been completely honest
about his abilities.

255
00:21:12,374 --> 00:21:14,467
And I think it's great.

256
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:18,674
Well, it's not just metal.

257
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:22,007
He's affecting you too. He's using
his powers to make you like him.

258
00:21:22,184 --> 00:21:23,446
Don't be ridiculous.

259
00:21:23,618 --> 00:21:27,418
Your brain is like a circuit board of
magnetic impulses, and Chloe and l--

260
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:29,887
You talked to Chloe about this?

261
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:31,923
It's like he's a giant magnet.

262
00:21:32,094 --> 00:21:33,994
And he's able to control
those impulses...

263
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:37,723
...make your brain secrete the
chemicals that control your emotions.

264
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:39,833
That's crazy.

265
00:21:40,102 --> 00:21:43,936
Lana, the brain releases chemicals
that control depression and hunger.

266
00:21:44,106 --> 00:21:47,769
-Why not attraction?
-Seth isn't touching me now.

267
00:21:48,076 --> 00:21:52,069
But I'm beginning to care more about
him than I have for any other guy.

268
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:53,805
Ever.

269
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:58,484
-So how do you explain that?
-I don't know.

270
00:21:59,421 --> 00:22:01,082
Maybe it's like metal.

271
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:04,282
The longer a magnet touches metal,
the longer the effects last.

272
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:07,519
Look, Clark. If you don't wanna
date me, that's fine.

273
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:09,755
But to make up some crazy theory
so I don't--

274
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:11,592
Lana, that's not it.

275
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:17,137
I came here to tell you that
who I date is none of your business.

276
00:22:18,273 --> 00:22:21,709
-Lana, Seth is dangerous.
-No, Clark, you are.

277
00:22:23,545 --> 00:22:26,673
We're not together anymore,
and that was your choice.

278
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,640
So let me go.

279
00:22:52,474 --> 00:22:53,839
Great.

280
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:59,506
Evening.

281
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:08,216
Go ahead, call the cops.

282
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,358
The first question
they're gonna ask is...

283
00:23:10,525 --> 00:23:14,359
...why would a person like me
break into a high school newspaper?

284
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,657
Whatever could I be looking for?

285
00:23:17,966 --> 00:23:20,298
Who are you?
What do you want?

286
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:24,565
I'm working for someone who's
interested in the same thing you are.

287
00:23:25,474 --> 00:23:27,635
Which Luthor sent you?

288
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:32,611
Why would you jump
to that conclusion, Chloe?

289
00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:36,047
Wait. What do you think you're doing?

290
00:23:36,785 --> 00:23:39,686
Something I doubt that you'll
want to tell the police about.

291
00:23:42,991 --> 00:23:44,458
You have a nice night.

292
00:23:59,374 --> 00:24:01,569
I gotta say, I like the new Lana.

293
00:24:01,743 --> 00:24:05,110
I took your advice and
splurged on a whole new wardrobe.

294
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,305
I can't wait to see the rest later.

295
00:24:07,482 --> 00:24:09,780
I could do a fashion show.

296
00:24:16,892 --> 00:24:20,555
You know how you said you wanted
to get out of Smallville someday?

297
00:24:22,764 --> 00:24:24,026
Why not today?

298
00:24:26,101 --> 00:24:28,035
Are you serious?

299
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,736
Where do you wanna go?

300
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,970
I don't know. I figured we'd just
see where the road takes us.

301
00:24:38,413 --> 00:24:39,846
What do you say?

302
00:24:44,252 --> 00:24:46,584
I'd go anywhere with you.

303
00:24:52,127 --> 00:24:56,063
You know we're probably
gonna need some money.

304
00:25:00,435 --> 00:25:02,369
I think I've got that covered.

305
00:25:03,138 --> 00:25:04,662
Right.

306
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:14,107
Meet me out back.
I've got a surprise for you, okay?

307
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:25,787
What are you doing, cleaning us out?

308
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,894
Taking an advance
on my share of the profits.

309
00:25:29,531 --> 00:25:32,261
Okay, joke's over.
Put the money back.

310
00:25:32,434 --> 00:25:37,133
I'm not joking, Lex. I need the cash.
Seth and I are leaving Smallville.

311
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,541
Lana, you can't be serious.

312
00:25:43,712 --> 00:25:47,239
I can't stay in Smallville
for a coffee shop, Lex.

313
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:49,747
Try and understand,
my whole family's gone.

314
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:52,113
My friends have changed.

315
00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:56,121
I found someone who really wants
to be with me, who trusts me.

316
00:25:56,558 --> 00:25:59,584
For the first time in a long time,
I don't feel like I'm alone.

317
00:26:06,935 --> 00:26:08,698
Hop in.

318
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:12,469
Pretty sweet ride for a 1 6-year-old.

319
00:26:15,076 --> 00:26:18,239
Lana, you're making a serious mistake.

320
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:20,776
Have a nice life, Lex.

321
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:23,582
Let's go.

322
00:26:34,963 --> 00:26:36,555
Where's Lana?

323
00:26:36,731 --> 00:26:38,858
Leaving town with her new boyfriend.

324
00:26:40,335 --> 00:26:42,565
She just cleared out the register.

325
00:26:43,004 --> 00:26:47,031
Don't worry, I'm calling the sheriff.
They won't even make it out of town.

326
00:27:17,605 --> 00:27:20,267
What happened?
What's wrong?

327
00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:24,611
We're stuck.

328
00:27:32,087 --> 00:27:34,783
Look at this.
It's like the road melted.

329
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:38,082
I can't believe this.

330
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,552
Oh, my God.

331
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:42,887
Seth, it's the sheriff.

332
00:27:47,135 --> 00:27:48,693
What are we gonna do?

333
00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:57,742
Don't worry, okay?
We're gonna be together.

334
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:00,275
Trust me.

335
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:22,201
Lana Lang, remain in the vehicle
and put your hands on the dashboard.

336
00:28:26,908 --> 00:28:29,001
Clark, you were right.

337
00:28:29,177 --> 00:28:31,907
-I didn't believe you before, but now....
-It's okay.

338
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,048
We all make mistakes, believe me.

339
00:28:34,616 --> 00:28:37,016
Sheriff Adams knows
that you didn't steal the car...

340
00:28:37,185 --> 00:28:39,745
...and Lex has a lawyer
working on the other charges.

341
00:28:41,656 --> 00:28:43,283
I was so mean to you.

342
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:46,250
You still didn't give up on me.

343
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:52,460
Do you have any idea where Seth went?

344
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:58,438
Well, he's got a brother
in Grandville, works at a diner.

345
00:28:58,606 --> 00:29:00,506
We were gonna stay with him.

346
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,237
Clark.

347
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:16,279
Thank you.

348
00:29:30,905 --> 00:29:33,567
You're a Luthor, so it's a given
that you're unscrupulous.

349
00:29:33,741 --> 00:29:36,801
But I really thought
petty larceny was beneath you, Lex.

350
00:29:36,978 --> 00:29:39,344
Can you be a little more
specific with the charge?

351
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:43,075
I caught some creep in my office,
trying to steal one of my computers.

352
00:29:43,251 --> 00:29:46,311
I figured either you
or your father hired him.

353
00:29:46,488 --> 00:29:47,921
But you're accusing me.

354
00:29:48,089 --> 00:29:51,388
You're what they euphemistically
call "the lesser of two evils."

355
00:29:51,726 --> 00:29:54,991
I admire your take-charge attitude.

356
00:29:55,163 --> 00:29:58,496
Barging in here
and accusing me took guts.

357
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,266
Or sheer stupidity.

358
00:30:01,903 --> 00:30:05,999
What do you say
we pay a visit to your intruder?

359
00:30:10,345 --> 00:30:11,937
How did he die?

360
00:30:13,648 --> 00:30:15,479
Natural causes.

361
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,710
-Apparently, his heart just gave out.
-You believe that?

362
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:20,411
Given what he was looking into...

363
00:30:20,588 --> 00:30:23,148
...I doubt there was anything
natural about his death.

364
00:30:23,892 --> 00:30:26,554
How do I know you're not
just playing me, Lex?

365
00:30:28,229 --> 00:30:30,561
You're right, Chloe.
I could be.

366
00:30:31,065 --> 00:30:34,796
I often bring high school girls to the
morgue to show them what happens...

367
00:30:34,969 --> 00:30:37,802
...when trained professionals
cross my father.

368
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:40,739
Well, there's nothing
in my files worth killing for.

369
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:43,605
We've got a corpse here
that says you're wrong.

370
00:30:46,114 --> 00:30:48,912
Chloe, you're involved
in a very dangerous game.

371
00:30:51,486 --> 00:30:53,351
I can protect you.

372
00:30:54,122 --> 00:30:56,716
Yeah, like you protected him?

373
00:31:00,862 --> 00:31:03,592
Mason knew the risks
of tangling with my father.

374
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:06,890
You clearly don't.

375
00:31:08,036 --> 00:31:10,163
I'm the only choice you've got.

376
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:31,284
Hey! What are you doing in here?
You're not supposed to--!

377
00:31:37,131 --> 00:31:38,598
Seth.

378
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:42,332
I'm so happy you're here.

379
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:46,731
Really? I just saw Clark leave, and I thought
you were having second thoughts.

380
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:48,739
Clark's my past.
You're my future.

381
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:52,141
I made up a story, told him
that you were headed to Grandville.

382
00:31:52,313 --> 00:31:54,008
Put your hands in the air.

383
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:05,089
Go on.

384
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:12,290
Seth doesn't have
a brother in Grandville.

385
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:14,697
Lana was trying
to throw me off his trail.

386
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:17,269
She lied to me, right to my face,
and I believed her.

387
00:32:17,438 --> 00:32:20,202
She's clearly not herself, Clark.

388
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,775
I know. I'm not angry.

389
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:26,045
I realize that that's what
I've been doing to her.

390
00:32:26,214 --> 00:32:29,206
Your feelings
for Lana are not a lie.

391
00:32:29,384 --> 00:32:31,852
You think I made the right decision,
pushing her away?

392
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:33,713
I don't know.

393
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,954
I miss the days when your answers
were yes and no.

394
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:40,026
Me too.

395
00:32:41,195 --> 00:32:44,221
Hey, Seth pulled a Bonnie and Clyde
and broke Lana out of jail.

396
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,924
-What?
-Sheriff's got all the roads blocked.

397
00:32:47,101 --> 00:32:49,092
She's gonna ruin her life
being with him.

398
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,465
-I gotta find them.
-Clark, they could be hiding anywhere.

399
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:53,607
They're a needle in a haystack.

400
00:32:56,744 --> 00:32:58,075
Depends on the needle.

401
00:33:23,371 --> 00:33:25,271
I can't believe you came back for me.

402
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,873
You could've been caught.

403
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:29,532
I'd never leave
Smallville without you.

404
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:31,872
-You're all I've ever wanted.
-Let's go now...

405
00:33:32,046 --> 00:33:33,980
...and get out of here,
just the two of us.

406
00:33:34,148 --> 00:33:36,946
No, not yet.
It's too dangerous.

407
00:33:37,118 --> 00:33:39,018
They take the rides
out tomorrow morning.

408
00:33:39,187 --> 00:33:41,246
We'll slip away on one of the trucks.

409
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:43,983
Come here.

410
00:33:55,002 --> 00:33:56,902
You're not taking her anywhere.

411
00:33:58,506 --> 00:34:00,064
I told you to stay away from her.

412
00:34:00,241 --> 00:34:01,833
Clark.

413
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:05,440
Let him go.

414
00:34:12,987 --> 00:34:15,080
Let him go, Clark,
or I swear, I'll shoot.

415
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:20,519
Get away from him, Clark!

416
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,594
Lana, I can handle it from here.

417
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:38,136
Just go. Just meet me outside, okay?

418
00:34:53,861 --> 00:34:55,158
You need help, Seth.

419
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:58,127
No, you're just saying that
because you want Lana back.

420
00:34:58,299 --> 00:34:59,994
But you can't have her.

421
00:35:09,777 --> 00:35:12,405
Looks like I'm not
the only one with special powers.

422
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:33,024
Clark, you can't fight physics.

423
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:40,269
Neither can you.

424
00:36:11,806 --> 00:36:13,501
Nice outfit.

425
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:17,507
It goes with the community service.

426
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:21,337
Which is getting off easy,
after what I did.

427
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:26,443
Lex, thanks for all your help.

428
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:31,082
What good are lawyers
if they can't jump through hoops?

429
00:36:32,393 --> 00:36:34,623
Any word on your friend Seth?

430
00:36:34,795 --> 00:36:36,126
He's still in a coma.

431
00:36:36,297 --> 00:36:39,960
They don't know what he'll remember
if and when he ever wakes up.

432
00:36:41,435 --> 00:36:43,369
Lex, I'm sorry I let you down.

433
00:36:45,306 --> 00:36:49,800
I can't defend my behavior,
magnetism or no magnetism.

434
00:36:50,278 --> 00:36:52,405
But I'd really like
my job at the Talon back.

435
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,172
Done.

436
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:56,474
I'm serious.
The place needs you.

437
00:36:56,651 --> 00:36:59,085
And I make a lousy latte.

438
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:03,051
-Lex--
-Lana...

439
00:37:03,224 --> 00:37:06,557
...I did a lot worse things than
steal a sports car when I was your age.

440
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:10,823
And I'm the last guy to criticize someone
for falling for the wrong person.

441
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,761
But I'm sure the right guy is out there.

442
00:37:29,383 --> 00:37:30,645
Lex.

443
00:37:34,322 --> 00:37:38,224
I was thinking about what you said,
and I need your help.

444
00:37:49,804 --> 00:37:52,967
All right, Chloe, you have the floor.

445
00:37:55,076 --> 00:37:57,442
It all started with the Wall of Weird.

446
00:37:57,611 --> 00:38:00,603
Your dad was interested
in the effects of the meteor rocks.

447
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:06,981
He wanted me to start feeding him
information about the more bizarre incidents.

448
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:14,321
It's always been an obsession of his.

449
00:38:16,664 --> 00:38:19,758
But I can't imagine that's
the extent of your arrangement.

450
00:38:21,035 --> 00:38:23,629
He wanted me to spy on a friend.

451
00:38:25,873 --> 00:38:27,602
Who?

452
00:38:27,775 --> 00:38:29,572
It doesn't matter.

453
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:37,343
Clark.

454
00:38:39,787 --> 00:38:42,347
-And did you?
-Of course not.

455
00:38:42,523 --> 00:38:44,423
I would never do that.
Clark is my friend.

456
00:38:44,592 --> 00:38:48,858
And I told him that,
but then he threatened to fire my dad.

457
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:54,134
So I figured that in order to
get out of my agreement with him...

458
00:38:54,301 --> 00:38:56,269
...I had to find something on your father.

459
00:38:56,437 --> 00:39:00,464
You know, something damaging enough
so that I could blackmail Lionel Luthor.

460
00:39:04,278 --> 00:39:06,974
That was a very dangerous decision.

461
00:39:07,548 --> 00:39:08,845
I know.

462
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:15,286
I'll protect you, Chloe.

463
00:39:16,657 --> 00:39:18,682
You have my word.

464
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:23,725
But in order to do that, I need to know
what you found out about my father.

465
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:29,295
Have you ever heard
of a man named Morgan Edge?

466
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:35,364
Before he was killed, he was
the biggest crime lord in Metropolis.

467
00:39:40,014 --> 00:39:43,450
He was also your father's
closest childhood friend.

468
00:39:58,966 --> 00:40:00,263
Lana.

469
00:40:01,402 --> 00:40:05,600
I came by to say thank you
for saving me from Seth.

470
00:40:06,373 --> 00:40:07,897
And to apologize.

471
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:10,476
For real this time.

472
00:40:11,712 --> 00:40:14,340
I should've believed you, Clark.
I'm sorry.

473
00:40:15,716 --> 00:40:17,707
You weren't acting
of your own free will.

474
00:40:17,885 --> 00:40:19,147
Maybe.

475
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,880
But even though
I was under Seth's influence...

476
00:40:22,056 --> 00:40:24,854
...part of me always
knew you were right.

477
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:27,994
I just kept telling myself
that you were jealous.

478
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:31,560
I guess that's just the way
I wanted you to feel.

479
00:40:37,438 --> 00:40:40,669
It wasn't easy for me
to see you with another guy.

480
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:49,512
Are you still sure
you don't want to be that guy?

481
00:40:50,985 --> 00:40:52,680
Lana....

482
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,684
It's all right. I just wanted to
make sure before I told you this.

483
00:41:01,428 --> 00:41:06,627
Even though my compass
was way off with Seth...

484
00:41:09,069 --> 00:41:12,300
...he still had the courage
to be honest with me.

485
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,106
Then he used his abilities
to manipulate you.

486
00:41:15,276 --> 00:41:18,109
I am not condoning what he did.

487
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:20,509
Believe me, I'm paying for it.

488
00:41:24,218 --> 00:41:28,052
It still felt good caring for someone...

489
00:41:28,222 --> 00:41:30,747
...and having my feelings returned.

490
00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:34,818
I want that again.

491
00:41:38,098 --> 00:41:40,396
I don't expect you
to wait forever for me.

492
00:41:40,568 --> 00:41:42,468
Good.

493
00:41:42,636 --> 00:41:46,697
Because one of these days, someone's
gonna come along that's right for me.

494
00:41:47,308 --> 00:41:50,937
And I'm going to
want to be with that person.

495
00:41:53,714 --> 00:41:56,080
And you're gonna
have to deal with that.

496
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
