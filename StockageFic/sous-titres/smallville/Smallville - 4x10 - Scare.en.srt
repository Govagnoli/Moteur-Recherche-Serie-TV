1
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:19,570
Lana.

2
00:00:19,597 --> 00:00:22,127
I was hoping that you were up.

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,908
Is everything alright?

4
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,227
It's about Jason.

5
00:00:28,757 --> 00:00:31,514
I think I've made a horrible mistake.

6
00:00:32,806 --> 00:00:34,538
Jason.

7
00:00:35,926 --> 00:00:39,755
Lana, I'm not sure I'm the one you should
be talking to about this.

8
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:43,623
Actually, I think that you're exactly
who I should be talking to.

9
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:48,523
I've been thinking about it... the way we met,
the way he followed me here,

10
00:00:48,547 --> 00:00:51,500
the way he got a job at my school.

11
00:00:52,155 --> 00:00:55,971
I think that everything that Jason has
told me has been a lie.

12
00:00:57,947 --> 00:01:03,017
I'm starting to wonder if there's another
reason he came to Smallville besides me.

13
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:06,001
- Like what?
- I don't know.

14
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:10,856
But he's really starting to scare me.

15
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,719
Don't worry, Lana.

16
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:18,192
- I'd never let anything happen to you.
- I know.

17
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:22,754
And it's made one thing very clear.

18
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:28,649
I never should have given up on us.

19
00:01:29,152 --> 00:01:32,385
I can lie to myself as much as I want...

20
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:35,834
but I've always been in love with you.

21
00:02:05,523 --> 00:02:07,359
I knew I couldn't trust you, Clark.

22
00:02:07,396 --> 00:02:09,227
Jason, No!

23
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,269
Haven't you hurt her enough already?

24
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:23,559
Jason!

25
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:38,834
Clark can't protect you from me.

26
00:02:38,948 --> 00:02:40,587
Nobody can.

27
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:15,818
Jason!

28
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:24,896
Someone call an ambulance!

29
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:28,904
Jason...
Jason, can you hear me?

30
00:04:52,688 --> 00:04:55,761
Hey...
How's he doing?

31
00:04:57,134 --> 00:05:00,057
The doctors don't know.

32
00:05:00,137 --> 00:05:04,528
His heart's beating a mile-a-minute, and
they can't get his blood pressure down.

33
00:05:04,598 --> 00:05:08,136
That's a little odd for someone who's
unconscious, isn't it?

34
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:11,202
They said he's in some sort of a "panic mode"...

35
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:14,031
Like he's having a severe nightmare.

36
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:18,681
What happened?

37
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:27,798
He came by the Talon to
pick me up for lunch, and...

38
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:30,756
I ran upstairs to grab a jacket.

39
00:05:30,756 --> 00:05:31,945
And?

40
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,623
And I heard a crash...
that's it.

41
00:05:41,014 --> 00:05:47,406
He's been perfectly healthy. But the doctors
say if they can't get his heart rate down...

42
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,980
that he could have a heart attack.

43
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:56,426
They must have some idea what caused this.

44
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:59,347
I wish I could help them.

45
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:03,399
But he was just studying all morning before
he came to the apartment.

46
00:06:03,468 --> 00:06:06,812
The first time I saw him he was lying
on the Talon floor.

47
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,134
Well let us know if there's anything we
can do to help, O.K.?

48
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:18,671
They need his insurance card.

49
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:22,901
It's in my apartment. Could you guys go get
it for me? I don't want to leave his side.

50
00:06:22,974 --> 00:06:24,900
- Yeah.
- O.K.

51
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:48,554
Clark, I don't mean to go "Dr. Phil" on you, but don't
you think you should admit they're in a relationship?

52
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,777
Come on Chloe, I'm past that.

53
00:06:51,872 --> 00:06:57,115
Yeah, I should have known by that crippling stare
on your face since you walked into the apartment.

54
00:06:57,275 --> 00:07:00,560
I just could have used some more time to
ease into it, you know?

55
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,735
Clark, you were in love with her.
That's not something you just "ease" out of.

56
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,452
It's just by the time that I found out,
they were already this... serious thing.

57
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:16,686
Yeah. But we all keep secrets for our own
reasons. I don't think I have to tell you that.

58
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:26,243
I don't think going through Jason's personal
things falls under your "snoop jurisdiction. "

59
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,377
I'll take my chances
with the jury on this one.

60
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:32,266
I think maybe if we back-track through
Jason's last couple of days, it might help.

61
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:38,914
Ooh. Jason had a meeting at LuthorCorp
this morning.

62
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,467
Why didn't Lana say something?

63
00:07:41,637 --> 00:07:43,412
Maybe she didn't know.

64
00:07:51,506 --> 00:07:56,368
- This place seems dead.
- Yeah. My dad used to work overtime on Saturdays.

65
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,155
This lot should be full by now.

66
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,140
Where do you think everybody is?

67
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:07,356
I don't know. But while you're talking to Lex,
I'm going to give myself a "Backstage Tour. "

68
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,885
Clark.

69
00:08:27,585 --> 00:08:30,069
How the hell did you get in here?

70
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:32,476
Yeah, the gate was open.

71
00:08:32,702 --> 00:08:34,695
Your security seems a little
"M.I.A." (Missing in Action) lately.

72
00:08:34,742 --> 00:08:39,060
- That's obvious, but this is a restricted area.
- This will only take a second.

73
00:08:40,716 --> 00:08:43,375
I need someone to escort a guest out.

74
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:46,842
Look Clark, I'm sorry but I just got in from
Metropolis, I've got a lot to do.

75
00:08:46,915 --> 00:08:48,631
Just now.

76
00:08:48,998 --> 00:08:51,566
I thought you had a meeting with
Jason this morning.

77
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:54,544
Not with me. He was meeting with the head
of my H.R. (Human Resources) department.

78
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:56,789
You giving him a job?

79
00:08:56,956 --> 00:09:01,542
Just some leads. I felt guilty for getting
Jason fired from the school.

80
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:04,824
He didn't even want Lana to know about it,
I'm surprised he told you.

81
00:09:04,874 --> 00:09:07,017
He didn't.

82
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:12,101
Jason's lying unconscious at the hospital.
Some sort of neurological stress.

83
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,216
Do they know what happened?

84
00:09:14,216 --> 00:09:15,329
No.

85
00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:19,359
But your H.R. guy might have been the last
person to talk to him.

86
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,875
Look I'll track him down but Clark, there
could be a lot of reasons for Jason's condition.

87
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:28,442
There could also be a lot of reasons why this
place is deserted half-way through Saturday's shift.

88
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:32,283
I'll call in a specialist from Metropolis
to take a look at him.

89
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:35,456
Assure Lana that I'm doing everything
I can for him.

90
00:11:10,445 --> 00:11:13,401
I've been waiting for you Chloe.

91
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:17,539
- Mom?
- You can't escape this, Chloe.

92
00:11:17,563 --> 00:11:20,625
None of the women in our family
ever have.

93
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:17,011
No! No!

94
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:23,030
No, no!

95
00:13:06,128 --> 00:13:07,603
Standby.

96
00:13:08,117 --> 00:13:13,106
With all our safety precautions, how the
hell does a lab explode?

97
00:13:13,652 --> 00:13:18,886
Well, when you're dealing with meteor rocks,
it's very difficult to predict how our chemicals will react.

98
00:13:21,245 --> 00:13:26,330
Mr. Luthor, we're doing everything we can.
After the alarm sounded, we sealed the room.

99
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:31,195
All affected personnel have been quarrantined,
and we're trying to fix the damaged pipes.

100
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:35,881
- You mean the bacteria's still leaking out?
- Only in that room.

101
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:43,564
Once the situation is under control,
I want the project dismantled.

102
00:13:43,618 --> 00:13:46,033
But, Mr. Luthor...

103
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:50,875
Your father negotiated this contract with
the military, we stand to make a lot

104
00:13:50,876 --> 00:13:52,900
if we can ever market the compound.

105
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:57,887
And exactly what is the market for toxins that
evoke a person's worst nightmare

106
00:13:57,946 --> 00:13:59,385
before they fall unconscious, Dr. Ford?

107
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:03,665
Think of the good. We could disable the
enemy without ever using violence,

108
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:07,169
- We have statistics to prove...
- Statistics aren't lying in those beds!

109
00:14:07,261 --> 00:14:09,202
My employees are.

110
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,768
And I'm afraid they're not the only ones.

111
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:14,374
What do you mean?

112
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:19,725
Someone who was visiting the plant this morning
is in the hospital with the same symptoms.

113
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,941
- Is he contagious?
- Oh no sir, no sir.

114
00:14:22,969 --> 00:14:27,558
The bacteria can't be transmitted from one
person to another, it has to be inhaled directly.

115
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:31,133
Then there's no reason to call the CDC (Center for
Disease Control) and panic the entire town.

116
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,903
Now where are we with the antidote?

117
00:14:34,903 --> 00:14:40,223
This will clarify when it reaches 1000 degrees
Kelvin, and then we can test it.

118
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:42,394
What's the E.T.A. (Estimate Time
of Arrival)?

119
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:49,514
Another 5 hours.

120
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:58,534
8 other people have just come down with the
condition that Jason and Chloe have.

121
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,432
The doctor's haven't found anything in common?

122
00:15:01,446 --> 00:15:04,161
Didn't you say that Jason and Chloe were
both at LuthorCorp today?

123
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:07,213
Yeah but half the victims in the hospital weren't.

124
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,497
Whatever this is seems to strike completely
at random.

125
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:12,581
There's no way to tell who's going to be next.

126
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:15,538
Sounds contagious. In the air or the water?

127
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,921
Then maybe it will show up in some
environmental quality report.

128
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:24,720
- Lana.
- Come on in.

129
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:29,871
I'm sorry to show up like this, I
just didn't know where else to go.

130
00:15:29,924 --> 00:15:32,926
Clark told us about Jason.
Has something happened?

131
00:15:33,427 --> 00:15:36,623
One of the other infected people just died.

132
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:40,182
Lana, do the doctors have any idea at all
what's going on?

133
00:15:41,147 --> 00:15:47,334
Just that a person's body can only sustain a level
of panic for so long before their heart gives out.

134
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:56,162
I can't just sit in that hospital any more, just...
just watching Chloe and Jason die.

135
00:16:01,096 --> 00:16:03,546
I want to help.

136
00:16:20,891 --> 00:16:23,736
I hope we didn't separate you from your flock.

137
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:30,213
I understand your cynicism, Warden Stone,
but I assure you I truly am a changed man.

138
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:33,189
Oh. Or just a smart one.

139
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:38,016
You know, ever since you proclaimed this sudden
conversion to our resident "St. Paul",

140
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:40,217
there hasn't been a single attempt on your life.

141
00:16:40,277 --> 00:16:43,222
I want only to be of help to others.

142
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:49,460
What is the value of my sinful life, unless I use
it as an example to shepherd fellow sinners?

143
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:54,105
to lead the away from the allure of hedonism,
and mistrust and greed.

144
00:16:54,184 --> 00:16:56,672
To follow a better way.

145
00:16:56,989 --> 00:16:58,356
Uh-huh.

146
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,570
Well I'm afraid you're going to have to
change congregations.

147
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:02,692
What do you mean?

148
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,935
The appellate court overturned your conviction.

149
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:07,150
Overturned?

150
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:09,908
My appeal doesn't come up for months.
It's not possible.

151
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:13,361
You'd be surprised what's possible
in this judicial system.

152
00:17:15,846 --> 00:17:21,240
I've done everything to work the system.
I hired the best lawyers in the world, I tried

153
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:24,908
to pay off everyone from the baliff to the
President of the United States,

154
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:30,329
and I was told, categorically, I was never
going to see life outside these walls again.

155
00:17:30,395 --> 00:17:32,892
You do not want to be telling me things
of this nature.

156
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:35,993
Yes, I do.
I'm guilty.

157
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:39,155
Not of the crime I've been imprisoned for, but...

158
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:45,911
so many other crimes, which should
have landed me in here years ago.

159
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:49,589
This is where I belong.

160
00:17:49,672 --> 00:17:52,447
It's where I can do the most good.

161
00:17:56,745 --> 00:17:59,299
You... you want to stay in prison?

162
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:04,101
Yes...
I do. I've found my...

163
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:10,698
my mission in life.

164
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:14,239
Contrary to your deluded point-of-view,

165
00:18:14,445 --> 00:18:19,432
this is not the Ritz Carlton, where you can
check in and check out at your leisure.

166
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,961
Somebody did you a favor by getting you
out of this place. I'd say be grateful.

167
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:28,676
But who? Who could do that?

168
00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:32,911
Obviously someone more powerful than you.

169
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:38,848
As soon as this paperwork is finished...
you're a free man.

170
00:18:48,371 --> 00:18:51,394
We know that Jason was in town by 9 o'clock.

171
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:54,234
According to the hourly satellite images,
we had clear skies all morning.

172
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:56,787
Hourly? Can we get it a bit more
specific than that?

173
00:18:56,815 --> 00:18:58,374
I'll try.

174
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:03,522
I just don't understand why Jason wouldn't
tell me that he had a meeting at Luthorcorp.

175
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:07,447
It might have been a blow to his pride.
Accepting Lex's offer.

176
00:19:08,306 --> 00:19:11,668
Well maybe that's what all of this
has been about.

177
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:16,580
I've been getting this feeling lately that
there's something he hasn't been telling me.

178
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:19,600
Maybe he thought you'd see him differently
if you found out.

179
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:23,304
Do you really think that I'm
that shallow, Clark?

180
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:27,907
It might take him a while to get
to know you as well as I do.

181
00:19:33,761 --> 00:19:35,464
Look at that.

182
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,137
It's like that cloud came out of nowhere.

183
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:40,878
And then it's completely gone 5 minutes later.

184
00:19:40,934 --> 00:19:43,304
It covered 2 miles before it dissipated.

185
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:46,160
- Why would a cloud just appear like that?
- Maybe it's not a cloud.

186
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:50,464
- Maybe it's pollution or smoke or something.
- If that's the county line, Chloe's house is

187
00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:54,165
right in the middle of it.
- So is LuthorCorp.

188
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:47,978
Mom?

189
00:20:54,793 --> 00:20:56,830
Dad?

190
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:18,883
Jason!

191
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,209
Lana...

192
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:38,098
Lana.

193
00:21:56,571 --> 00:21:58,965
They're all going to leave you.

194
00:21:58,992 --> 00:22:02,377
And there's nothing you can do about it.

195
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:08,829
Lana!

196
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:19,950
- I need you to hold him, get over here!
- Yes, sir.

197
00:22:40,246 --> 00:22:46,660
Mr. Luthor, we have never tested this antidote,
I urge you to try it on a lab animal first.

198
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:51,800
One of my employees is about to die. Do you
see any other options for us right now?

199
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:56,515
No sir, I don't. But please remember,
this is like a flu innoculation,

200
00:22:56,522 --> 00:22:59,742
it contains traces of the infectious element.

201
00:23:00,052 --> 00:23:03,907
Is that your way of telling me the patient's
going to get worse before he gets better?

202
00:23:04,575 --> 00:23:06,834
Assuming it works.

203
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,611
Mr. Luthor, you can't go in there!

204
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,201
You must keep exposure to the toxin
to a minimum!

205
00:23:19,226 --> 00:23:23,809
I'm responsible for this plant and everyone
who works here... I'm going with you.

206
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:36,241
I understand you're treating a patient
named Jason Teague?

207
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:39,958
Lex, I've got my hands full right now. We're
watching Mr. Teague,

208
00:24:39,966 --> 00:24:41,712
along with all the others in his condition.

209
00:24:41,786 --> 00:24:45,648
The others? Are you telling me all these
people have the same symptoms?

210
00:24:45,741 --> 00:24:49,656
Unfortunately.
We have no idea what we're dealing with.

211
00:24:52,164 --> 00:24:54,606
It's a synthetic toxin.

212
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:59,408
A pressure tank exploded this morning at
my plant.

213
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:03,791
We thought we had it contained but the toxin
release must have escaped into the atmosphere.

214
00:25:03,904 --> 00:25:06,870
It's possible all these people were exposed
at the time.

215
00:25:06,886 --> 00:25:11,649
And you're just telling me this now? I have
to call the center for disease control.

216
00:25:11,653 --> 00:25:15,921
I don't know how much they can do, but there's an
antidote my project manager's been modifying as we speak

217
00:25:15,937 --> 00:25:17,265
How close is it?

218
00:25:17,355 --> 00:25:20,721
The first trial was unsuccessful, but I assure you
we will have the situation under control.

219
00:25:20,804 --> 00:25:22,214
It's too late for that.

220
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:25,286
I need a doctor.
I need a doctor!

221
00:25:31,574 --> 00:25:34,080
Did you know about this when I talked
to you earlier today?

222
00:25:34,162 --> 00:25:38,742
Clark, other than Jason, I had no idea anyone
outside of LuthorCorp was exposed,

223
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,568
you have to believe me.

224
00:25:42,622 --> 00:25:44,676
What is this, though?

225
00:26:38,692 --> 00:26:40,891
It all makes sense.

226
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:46,942
Lana.
Help me.

227
00:26:46,994 --> 00:26:49,471
The meteor shower.

228
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,978
You came the same day.

229
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:55,091
How could I be so stupid?

230
00:26:55,443 --> 00:26:58,661
The meteor shower is the reason I'm here.

231
00:26:59,296 --> 00:27:02,745
I'm from a planet called Krypton.

232
00:27:05,281 --> 00:27:07,907
Lana, I wanted to tell you.

233
00:27:07,913 --> 00:27:10,992
But I didn't think you'd accept me.

234
00:27:17,676 --> 00:27:20,274
You're not even human?

235
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:26,441
No, please.
That stuff makes me sick!

236
00:27:28,093 --> 00:27:31,734
My parents are gone because of you.

237
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,823
I'm never going to see them again.

238
00:27:37,945 --> 00:27:41,236
You killed my parents.

239
00:27:57,395 --> 00:27:58,881
Mom.

240
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:04,929
Clark?

241
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,382
- I need to find my parents, where are they?
- They haven't been admitted.

242
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:11,381
Clark you're the first patient to come out of
this, I think you'd better sit down.

243
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:13,235
- No, I feel fine.
- Clark-

244
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,313
Dad?

245
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,059
Mom!

246
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,603
Mom?

247
00:28:49,178 --> 00:28:50,426
Lex!

248
00:28:50,502 --> 00:28:51,900
I'll keep you updated.

249
00:28:51,908 --> 00:28:53,633
- You're running out of time.
- How did you get past security?

250
00:28:53,713 --> 00:28:57,876
It's O.K... I don't understand, I left you
in the hospital, what happened?

251
00:28:57,881 --> 00:29:00,134
My parents are in there now.

252
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:01,206
Clark-

253
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:03,462
Lana, Chloe, Jason, they're all going to
die if you don't do something!

254
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:06,177
What do you suggest I do?

255
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:13,286
Use me.

256
00:29:14,871 --> 00:29:17,353
I want you to use me.

257
00:29:17,654 --> 00:29:21,566
Look, I came out of this panic state.
Maybe there's something in me that can help.

258
00:29:21,622 --> 00:29:23,776
I'll give you whatever samples you need.

259
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:26,981
Look, even if your immune system could offer
us some sort of insight, those kind of

260
00:29:27,075 --> 00:29:30,673
tests take months, years to analyze!
No, no...

261
00:29:33,918 --> 00:29:38,878
He's right, Clark. We have a new antidote
that we can test in a few hours.

262
00:29:38,948 --> 00:29:40,146
There's no time.

263
00:29:40,148 --> 00:29:44,072
The antidote needs to be heated to 1000 degrees
Kelvin until it clears, otherwise it's useless!

264
00:29:44,144 --> 00:29:46,359
This time we're going to test it first.

265
00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:49,444
People's lives are at stake. We're
running out of time.

266
00:29:49,464 --> 00:29:52,040
Look at them, Mr. Luthor. You look at them.

267
00:29:52,046 --> 00:29:56,859
Are you going to point the finger and decide which
one of them is going to take the lethal injection?

268
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,698
Whoever it is, you could be killing them.

269
00:30:49,153 --> 00:30:51,205
Mr. Luthor, No!

270
00:31:56,178 --> 00:31:58,511
- Clark?
- Thank God it worked.

271
00:31:58,554 --> 00:32:02,761
- I'm going to get the antidote to the hospital.
- Lex, you're going to be O.K.

272
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:48,826
I should have known.

273
00:33:03,352 --> 00:33:05,061
Clark.

274
00:33:06,575 --> 00:33:08,478
Is there something bothering you son?

275
00:33:08,493 --> 00:33:11,871
No, it'll just take a few days before I can
walk into that room, and...

276
00:33:13,586 --> 00:33:17,685
not get a flash of the two of you
unconscious on the floor.

277
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:20,948
Thanks for cleaning everything up.

278
00:33:21,555 --> 00:33:25,603
Somebody really did a number on that lamp
back there.

279
00:33:25,616 --> 00:33:27,487
Must have been some nightmare you had.

280
00:33:27,494 --> 00:33:30,906
And we woke up to find that it
almost came true.

281
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:34,285
Clark you walked right into Lex's office
and almost gave up your secret.

282
00:33:34,411 --> 00:33:36,582
Who knows what they would have done to you?

283
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:38,859
I didn't see any other choice.

284
00:33:38,955 --> 00:33:42,374
It's funny, because lately I've been thinking
I've gotten closer to

285
00:33:42,443 --> 00:33:45,135
being able to tell someone the truth about
me, but...

286
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:51,761
now I'm convinced more than ever that
I can't tell anyone.

287
00:33:52,992 --> 00:33:55,363
Especially not Lana.

288
00:33:56,343 --> 00:34:00,417
I know how much it would mean to you
to be able to share your secret with her.

289
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:02,831
As far apart as we've grown...

290
00:34:04,391 --> 00:34:06,674
I think about it every day.

291
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:13,130
I hope our own fears haven't gotten in your way.

292
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,380
I would hate for you to look back, and
regret not telling the people closest to you.

293
00:34:19,539 --> 00:34:23,391
I mean, there is a chance
Lana would understand.

294
00:34:26,061 --> 00:34:28,065
There is.

295
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:30,220
But what if she didn't?

296
00:34:33,259 --> 00:34:37,009
Clark, look. I'm not...
sure that it's Lana...

297
00:34:38,365 --> 00:34:40,546
But I am sure that...

298
00:34:41,828 --> 00:34:45,361
someday there will be someone you can tell.

299
00:34:56,175 --> 00:34:59,039
Egg-Foo-Yung to the rescue!

300
00:35:05,414 --> 00:35:10,420
So, if I'd waited around the Peking Duck,
you'd have, what...

301
00:35:10,956 --> 00:35:12,484
been gone?

302
00:35:14,678 --> 00:35:18,550
No I would have been here.
Trying to figure out what to say.

303
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:23,527
I don't understand.

304
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:27,136
Is this because of your mom?

305
00:35:27,847 --> 00:35:30,172
You've been different ever since I met her.

306
00:35:30,182 --> 00:35:32,963
No I've been different every since I
came to Smallville.

307
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:36,804
6 months ago, I never would have gone to
someone like Lex,

308
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,582
and groveled for a job that I don't even want.

309
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:47,406
Worst part is, I was too embarrassed
to even tell you about it.

310
00:35:47,876 --> 00:35:50,565
Since when have you ever been embarrassed
around me?

311
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:52,266
Exactly.

312
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:57,460
I don't like this person that I'm becoming, Lana.

313
00:35:57,965 --> 00:36:03,251
And I don't want to wait around for you to
resent me as much as I resent myself, so...

314
00:36:07,055 --> 00:36:09,134
That's not why you're leaving.

315
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:16,748
The one thing I learned from my relationship with
Clark is when someone isn't being honest with me.

316
00:36:24,213 --> 00:36:27,506
Jason.
Just tell me the truth.

317
00:36:50,387 --> 00:36:52,090
Be careful.

318
00:37:14,189 --> 00:37:17,671
I can't get a statement from LuthorCorp.
A huge chemical explosion causes everyone

319
00:37:17,712 --> 00:37:20,210
to relive their worst nightmares, what is that?!?

320
00:37:20,241 --> 00:37:26,315
And there's no sign of a lawsuit, it's like this
whole thing is being completely forgotten about!

321
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,974
What? What?

322
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,319
WHAT!

323
00:37:31,388 --> 00:37:34,930
I've seen you worked up before, but this
is more than amped, even for you.

324
00:37:35,313 --> 00:37:38,439
I guess it's just displaced anxiety.

325
00:37:41,996 --> 00:37:44,315
I found my mom, Clark.

326
00:37:48,148 --> 00:37:50,008
Wow, that's...

327
00:37:50,022 --> 00:37:51,521
Chloe that's great!

328
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:55,916
Yeah, I put my "feelers" out for years and
something 3 months ago finally came through, so...

329
00:37:56,319 --> 00:37:59,470
And it turns out she's...

330
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,677
she's not exactly "M.I.A." (Missing in Action),
so to speak.

331
00:38:08,262 --> 00:38:11,306
She's in a mental institution.

332
00:38:18,978 --> 00:38:20,815
I'm sorry.

333
00:38:21,096 --> 00:38:23,960
The real kicker is, it's hereditary.

334
00:38:23,964 --> 00:38:28,855
Listen, hey..
If there's one thing I've learned,

335
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:33,152
it's that you're not destined to
follow in your parent's footsteps, alright?

336
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:35,889
O.K.
Thanks.

337
00:38:37,804 --> 00:38:40,728
So, popular question of the day.

338
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:44,316
What is Clark Kent's worst nightmare?

339
00:38:46,822 --> 00:38:49,169
When I woke up.

340
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:54,367
Everyone that I knew was gone.

341
00:38:56,783 --> 00:38:59,428
I was completely alone.

342
00:38:59,435 --> 00:39:02,854
I wish I could say that I'll
always be there for you, but...

343
00:39:03,178 --> 00:39:07,400
somehow I get the feeling that may not
be a promise I can keep.

344
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:10,913
You were the only one that came out
of it, Clark, and...

345
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:13,429
I don't think it's because you've been
taking your vitamins.

346
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:17,508
- Chloe.
- Look, you know what, you don't have to tell me.

347
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:24,663
I know that I gave you my word that I was
going to stop all this prying, but...

348
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:31,229
In these last few months I got a taste of
what it was like to keep my mom's secret...

349
00:39:31,254 --> 00:39:33,824
and I've never felt more alone.

350
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:41,108
It's weird when people think they're so close to you,
but have no idea what you're really going through.

351
00:39:41,153 --> 00:39:42,514
Yeah.

352
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,922
I'd hate to live my whole life like this.

353
00:39:47,976 --> 00:39:54,631
But, after "fessing up" (confessing) it's amazing how
quickly that feeling of loneliness disappears.

354
00:39:54,668 --> 00:39:58,878
I mean, if you can't tell your best friend,
who can you tell?

355
00:39:59,307 --> 00:40:01,832
Right, Clark?
