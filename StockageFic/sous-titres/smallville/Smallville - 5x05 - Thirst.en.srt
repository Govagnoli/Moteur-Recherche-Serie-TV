1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,077
Normally I wouldn't waste my time
meeting with a college freshman...

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,753
...groveling for an internship.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,956
- Well, thank you, Ms. Kahn.
- Bitterman!

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,114
- Yeah, chief?
- Where's that piece on Senator Jennings?

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,669
- I'm typing it up.
- I don't see your fingers moving.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,877
Twenty minutes, or they'll be
twiddling over the want ads.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,837
Of course, chief.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,797
- Where was I?
- The internship.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,996
Oh, right, right, right.
You didn't get it.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,479
What?

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,196
Well, then why am I here?

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,272
Curiosity. It's the backbone
of any decent reporter.

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,271
Have you got backbone, Sullivan?

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,714
Yeah, I...

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,997
You had a column here
a couple of years ago, didn't you?

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,434
When I was in high school.

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,189
Well, that is quite
an accomplishment...

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,477
...to have your own byline
when you're practically still in diapers.

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,117
I mean, a lot of reporters...
Well, real reporters.

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,192
- Work for years before
they can get that kind of a chance.

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,874
I just wanted to meet the kid
that could pull that off.

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,713
- Thanks.
- Oh, well, don't thank me.

23
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,313
Thank Lionel Luthor.

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,948
He's the one who arm-twisted
the old chief editor...

25
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,918
...into dropping your juvenile pablum
into this paper.

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,959
- I didn't ask Lionel to do that.
- Well, you didn't say no either, did you?

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,350
You must've done something
to piss Lionel off...

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,556
...because he got you fired.

29
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,233
I remember that day.

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,038
I believe we had cake.

31
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,998
Ms. Kahn, I don't expect
to be given a column like last time.

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,675
I will start from the bottom
and work my way up...

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,637
...without any help or arm-twisting.

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,155
All I want is the opportunity
to prove myself.

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,072
Being a part of this world...

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,310
...working at the <i>Daily Planet...</i>

37
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,959
<i>...it's</i> always been my dream.

38
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,509
We all have to wake up sometime,
don't we, Sullivan?

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,918
By the way, we don't validate.

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,629
You know what, Ms. Kahn?

41
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,312
I know you may be editor in chief now,
but even you had to start somewhere.

42
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,951
And I am not gonna give up
until I get the same chance.

43
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,358
I started by being
a damn good reporter.

44
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,317
You want a break?

45
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,311
Bring me a story.

46
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,879
<i>Okay, let's stop for a second.</i>

47
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,952
<i>In case you can 't tell,</i>
<i>I was completely freaked out.</i>

48
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,351
<i>Pauline Kahn</i>
<i>had thrown down the gauntlet.</i>

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,717
<i>The woman had two Pulitzers.</i>
<i>I had a high school service plaque...</i>

50
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,997
<i>... and absolutely no idea where</i>
<i>my big story was gonna come from.</i>

51
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,515
<i>Little did I know</i>
<i>that 10 city blocks away...</i>

52
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,557
<i>... it was about to bite me in the ass.</i>

53
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
<i>Well, more like the neck,</i>
<i>but we'll get to that later.</i>

54
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,192
<i>Welcome to the Tri Psi sorority house.</i>

55
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,913
<i>I think that's Greek</i>
<i>for "bimbos, bikinis and beer."</i>

56
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,235
Pete's Pizza.
Delivered in 28 minutes, piping...

57
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,869
...hot.

58
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,873
Oh, my God, we are so starving.

59
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,192
Let's eat in the Jacuzzi.

60
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,236
I really should be getting back.

61
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,595
I have two more stops.

62
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,473
Can't you stay?

63
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,750
- Just for a little bit?
- Please?

64
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,957
Well, maybe just for a minute.

65
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,118
What about your pizza?

66
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,113
You taste so much better
than pepperoni.

67
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,789
No! No! Oh, God, no!

68
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,108
Singing telegram.

69
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,149
- Hey.
- Clark, hi.

70
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,197
I just wanted to...

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,912
...come by and surprise myself.
What's all this?

72
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,959
This is me packing.

73
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,236
- Packing for what?
- For college.

74
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,157
I got late acceptance to Met U.

75
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,673
Congratulations.

76
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,593
Why didn't you tell me
you applied to Met U?

77
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,591
Because I didn't wanna
get my hopes up.

78
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,877
You know, I applied so late,
I didn't think I had any chance.

79
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,032
With your grades,
they'd be crazy not to accept you.

80
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,272
Well, I got in just under the wire.

81
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,795
There aren't even
any dorm rooms left anymore.

82
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,269
- Where are you gonna stay?
- I can crash at chloe's.

83
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,112
But maybe I'll try a sorority.

84
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,474
I know how it sounds...

85
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,756
<i>...but</i> it's the only housing
near to campus...

86
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,309
...I have any shot of getting into.

87
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,833
You know, Central Kansas University
has plenty of housing still available.

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,629
- And...
- And they have you.

89
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,637
But they don't have any of the courses
that I'm really interested in.

90
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,995
Especially astronomy.

91
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,634
It's not gonna be that bad.

92
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,598
We'll talk to each other on the phone
all the time.

93
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,151
Don't worry.

94
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,752
Nothing's gonna change between us.

95
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,715
Welcome to the most prestigious
and exclusive sorority...

96
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,552
...at Metropolis University.

97
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,155
We are the richest,
we are the prettiest...

98
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,595
...we are the best.

99
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,116
Over the next few days,
many of you will be disappointed.

100
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,998
But if you're insanely <i>cool...</i>

101
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,151
...and very, very lucky...

102
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,073
...you might just be chosen
to be a Tri Psi.

103
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,198
And if that happens,
it'll change your life.

104
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,877
Forever.

105
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,150
<i>Meet Buffy Sanders,</i>
<i>president of the Tri Psi sorority.</i>

106
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,039
<i>By the way, I've changed the names</i>
<i>to protect the vapid.</i>

107
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,317
In the final days
of the Roman Empire...

108
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,676
...wealth and power...

109
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,308
...were the only things
the emperor coveted.

110
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,110
What about the good citizens
of Rome? What did they do?

111
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,796
Did they rise up? Burn their bras
and their draft cards?

112
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,277
No. They went to the Colosseum.

113
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,434
They stood idle while an evil man
destroyed their world.

114
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,237
In your lifetime, each of you
may be faced with a similar situation.

115
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,520
The question is, will you leave
your footprints on the history of time...

116
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,998
...or let them be washed away
by the tides of more powerful men?

117
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,711
Mr. Kent.

118
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,837
What about you?

119
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,394
Me? I...

120
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,473
LuthorCorp practically owns
your hometown of Smallville.

121
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,712
What if you found out
that Lex Luthor...

122
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,553
...the emperor of the company...

123
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,192
...was a dangerous, unstable
megalomaniac...

124
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,079
...bent on destroying your world?

125
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,435
Would you have the courage
to try to stop him?

126
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,112
I...

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,198
Read chapter three for Monday.
There'll be a quiz on the material.

128
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,310
Interesting lecture you've been giving.

129
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,677
- I hope you've been taking notes.
- Just the highlights.

130
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,389
You've been painting me
as the poster child for corporate villainy.

131
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,438
Some of the things you've said
come dangerously close to libel.

132
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,149
It's only libel if it isn't true.

133
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,632
Everything I say in this classroom
is supported by my research.

134
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,637
- Into me.
- You are a fascinating subject.

135
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,718
You wanna know
what fascinates me, professor?

136
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,670
Your lectures have
included speculation...

137
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,355
...on certain LuthorCorp projects
that aren't even public knowledge.

138
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,432
Oh, I'm sorry. I never speculate.

139
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,033
The study of history
is built on meticulous research...

140
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,990
...even before
coming to obvious conclusions.

141
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,272
And would one of your research sources
be Clark Kent?

142
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,517
I know you hired him
as your assistant.

143
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,390
Now, why would a man
of your stature...

144
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,997
...be so concerned with the comings
and goings of a freshman farm boy?

145
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,875
If you know so much about me,
professor, I'm sure you realize <i>that...</i>

146
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,869
...I donate a considerable
amount of funding to this university.

147
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,600
That allows me an unusual level
of access to the dean...

148
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,273
...and the academic review board.

149
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,431
Yeah, I know.

150
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,637
The buying of influence
is part of my second semester.

151
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,640
If you have a second semester.

152
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,157
You should all be very proud.

153
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,153
The four of you were amazing
during rush week.

154
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,118
Like little diamonds in the rough
waiting to be polished.

155
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,635
But not everyone is Tri Psi material.

156
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,871
It's sad, but it's a fact.

157
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,591
Carol, Bobbi, Susan,
please step forward.

158
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,278
The three of you were really great!

159
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,749
But great isn't enough for a Tri Psi.
A Tri Psi has to be excellent all over.

160
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,195
- Bye, now.
- Toodles.

161
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,713
- Bye-bye.
- You have to go.

162
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,599
Wait a minute, you mean that I'm in?

163
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,638
Lana, come on. You're amazing.

164
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,791
Of course we want you
to be one of us.

165
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,114
Wow, thank you.

166
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,989
But there is just this little initiation thing
that we have to do first.

167
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,400
- What the hell are you?
- We're Tri Psis.

168
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,596
The hottest vampires ever.

169
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,309
Welcome to the sisterhood.

170
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,478
Nice shot.

171
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,198
You just have to know the angles.

172
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,271
That why you've been looking
into my past?

173
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,794
Come on, professor.

174
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,914
You're not the only one interested
in history, are you?

175
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,231
You don't strike me as that much
of an academic type.

176
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,231
What's this?

177
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,757
I know you're a busy man.
Thought I'd save you some time.

178
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,958
That's my whole life in there.

179
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,749
Every record, every achievement,
every failure...

180
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,831
...all the way back
to the day I was born.

181
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,752
I'm supposed to just swallow all this?

182
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,753
You wouldn't be the great Lex Luthor
if you did.

183
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,514
No, you'll spend a fortune
checking and rechecking...

184
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,872
...convinced what you believe
must be true.

185
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,470
And what is it I believe, professor?

186
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,834
That everyone is hiding secrets
as dark as yours.

187
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,074
How did you get this?

188
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,391
Just used my brain.

189
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,357
It's an interesting document, isn't it?

190
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,353
It seems to indicate
you're using funding to the <i>university...</i>

191
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,637
...to conduct questionable
LuthorCorp experiments.

192
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,751
On campus.

193
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,632
But off the corporate books.

194
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,113
I wonder what the dean
would think about that.

195
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,553
Never start a game you can't win,
Mr. Luthor.

196
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,518
Follow.

197
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,591
With pleasure, sir.

198
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,991
What are you doing?

199
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,600
- I'm redecorating.
- Karen, this is my side of the room.

200
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,637
Yeah, but I gotta look at it, okay?

201
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,998
Now, listen to me. I did not spend
four years of high school misery...

202
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,789
...dreaming about coming to Met U
for this, okay?

203
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,234
- No, l...
- No, okay?

204
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,755
While we're on the subject
of roommate etiquette...

205
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,311
...can you please tell <i>questa ubriacata</i>
over here...

206
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,597
<i>...this</i> isn't the Betty Ford clinic,
okay?

207
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,998
I'm gonna go now.

208
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,598
I'd rather be roommates
with a two-headed monkey.

209
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,550
All right, Lana.
Rise and shine, Sleeping Beauty.

210
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,994
Up and at them.

211
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,116
<i>Okay, for someone</i>
<i>with a keen "weirdar"...</i>

212
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,191
<i>... I can 't believe I didn 't see the signs.</i>

213
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,557
<i>But I defy anyone to tell the difference</i>
<i>between a nascent vampire...</i>

214
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,631
<i>... and a freshman girl</i>
<i>with a hangover.</i>

215
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,189
Didn't you have class this morning?

216
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,158
I must have overslept.

217
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,719
First official day on campus
and you're already hung-over.

218
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,394
Maybe you really are sorority material.

219
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,472
- Is Lana here?
- Hey.

220
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,395
Yeah, what's left of her.
Pledge party. Higher learning at its best.

221
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,028
Maybe you should see
if you can breathe life into her.

222
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,511
I'll be at the library
researching ways to kill my roommate.

223
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,834
Rough night last night?

224
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,632
I guess.

225
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,074
It's all a little fuzzy.

226
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,756
It must have been some party.

227
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,475
I tried to call you a few times
last night...

228
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,949
...and again this morning.
Did you get my messages?

229
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,112
No, I haven't checked
my voicemail yet. Sorry.

230
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,715
Lana, are you okay?

231
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,558
I'm just feeling a bit dead.

232
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,871
God, you smell amazing.

233
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,998
Is that new aftershave?

234
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,472
No, it's just the usual.

235
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,272
Well, maybe we should try
something unusual.

236
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,074
Lana, l...

237
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,994
Shut up, Clark. You talk too much.

238
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,837
Lana, stop.
What's going on with you?

239
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,514
We're not in high school anymore, clark,
things change.

240
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,591
- I can see that.
- We're in college now.

241
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,150
- Live a little. I plan to.
- What does that mean?

242
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,873
It means exactly what I said.

243
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,671
If you're gonna be all needy
and insecure...

244
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,149
...maybe we need to reevaluate
this relationship.

245
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,678
Shouldn't put your hands
on things that aren't yours, professor.

246
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,236
Actually, it is mine.

247
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,599
<i>I Googled vampires.</i>

248
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,639
<i>Their historic traits include</i>
<i>aversion to sunlight, elongated canines...</i>

249
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,109
<i>... an insatiable hunger</i>
<i>for human blood.</i>

250
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,748
<i>Oh, and immortality.</i>

251
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,754
<i>Poor Lana is about to find out</i>
<i>about the last one the hard way.</i>

252
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,111
Looks like we picked a winner.

253
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,316
This is so much better
than sitting around...

254
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,268
...listening to my boyfriend
whine about his feelings.

255
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,238
You're a Tri Psi now, Lana.
We eat boyfriends for breakfast.

256
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,112
- Well, then, to breakfast.
- Breakfast.

257
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,920
Maybe I should slow down a little bit.

258
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,834
Where's the fun in that?

259
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,073
You are not one of the normal,
boring people anymore, Lana.

260
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,631
- You're one of us now.
- And we do things a little more exciting.

261
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,678
- Like what?
- Like this.

262
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,433
Oh, my God, did you see her face?

263
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,477
She's all like:

264
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,911
Oh, didn't we tell you?

265
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,109
You get to live forever.

266
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,071
Cool.

267
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,391
I don't know what's going on
with Lana.

268
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,869
<i>But I went over</i>
<i>to the sorority house to say hi...</i>

269
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,316
...and one of the pretty plastic people
told me she was still asleep...

270
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,879
<i>... at 3:00 in the afternoon.</i>

271
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,429
Yeah, I tried calling her too,
but she won't pick up.

272
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,033
Maybe she needs a little space.

273
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,919
- Or some serious deprogramming.
- What do you mean?

274
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,152
<i>Well, I'm pulling up some information</i>
<i>for a story I'm working on...</i>

275
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,709
<i>...and</i> I think there's more
going on at that house...

276
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,472
...than pedicures
and pillow fights.

277
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,551
I think you better get over here...

278
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,712
- Hey.
- Clark.

279
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,758
- What do you got?
- Besides a heart attack?

280
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,270
Okay, six years ago Tri Psi
was just your regular sorority...

281
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,351
...and then their new president
took over.

282
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,919
- Buffy Sanders.
- Yeah.

283
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,117
After that, they became
the most exclusive sorority at Met U.

284
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,272
They get more pledges than
any other Greek sorority every year...

285
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,954
...but they only choose one girl
to be part of Tri Psi.

286
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,109
- Lana.
- Yeah.

287
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,032
It looks like she's a member for life.

288
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,192
According to this, ever since
Buffy Sanders took over...

289
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,079
...not one Tri Psi has ever left
the sisterhood.

290
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,518
Think that has something to do
with the way Lana's been acting?

291
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,319
I think that there's only one way
that we can be sure.

292
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,671
- A costume party?
- It's the perfect <i>cover...</i>

293
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,751
...for us to get in there
and poke around.

294
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,069
I hate costumes.

295
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,352
Invitation?

296
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,229
Right, invitation.

297
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,755
I had one when I was
at the nail salon...

298
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,277
...and then, of course, I went
to get waxed and to the tanning bed.

299
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,158
So I...

300
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,709
Carlos, do you remember
where I put it?

301
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,878
Carlos?

302
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,912
No. No, I don't.

303
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,916
I'm not supposed to let you in
without an invitation.

304
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,716
But I won't tell if you don't, carlos.

305
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,393
Great. Okay, well...

306
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,557
Let's go, carlos. Sorry.

307
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,790
So Carlos, huh?

308
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,234
It starts with a C.

309
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,356
Don't you think the cape
was a little much?

310
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,353
I kind of like it. It's not too bad.

311
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,116
It's the mask. It slides around.
I can hardly see anything sometimes.

312
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,873
Why don't you check upstairs,
see if you can find anything.

313
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,519
I'll scope things out down here.

314
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,752
- Lf you see Lana...
- I'll let her know that you're here.

315
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,629
Lana!

316
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,591
- Lana.
- Hey!

317
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,639
Go play with your six-shooter. Me and
the kitty-cat here need to have a talk.

318
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,796
- What are you doing in here?
- I was looking for the bathroom.

319
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,639
Hot tub!

320
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,518
Sorry, Buff.

321
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,750
Come on, let's go.

322
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,869
Lana, what is wrong with you?

323
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,554
I'm having fun.
You should try it sometime.

324
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,551
What if Clark saw you with that guy?

325
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,790
You remember Clark, right?
Your boyfriend?

326
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,679
The one who cares about you
more than anything?

327
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,274
You sure know how
to ruin a party, don't you?

328
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,270
Lana, I don't know what's going on,
but this isn't you.

329
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,954
You wouldn't hurt clark like this.

330
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,194
I'm sorry, chloe.

331
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,436
But you shouldn't have come here.

332
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,873
Oh, sweetie, this isn't a movie.

333
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,835
<i>Never confront a vampire</i>
<i>when they're hungry.</i>

334
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,594
<i>Even if they are your best friend.</i>

335
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,592
<i>Clark. Please help me.</i>

336
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,633
Lana?

337
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,157
Frankly, I don't know what else to try.

338
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,754
We've given her a transfusion.
There's no improvement.

339
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,359
What's wrong with her?

340
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,714
As near as we can tell...

341
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,316
...she's been infected with
some sort of rabies-like virus.

342
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,711
It was probably transmitted in the saliva
of whatever animal bit her.

343
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,077
It's attacking her red blood cells,
preventing them from regenerating.

344
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,117
Is there anything you can do?

345
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,432
We can keep up the transfusions
and hope she stabilizes.

346
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,553
I'm sorry.

347
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,550
You have to fight it, Chloe.

348
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,639
You have to fight it.

349
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,232
Is she all right?

350
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,510
Professor, what are you doing here?

351
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,436
Visiting a sick colleague.

352
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,160
Though he seems to be doing
better than your friend.

353
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,754
- What happened to her?
- She was bitten.

354
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,433
By what?

355
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,909
I know how this is gonna sound...

356
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,114
...but I think she was attacked
by a vampire.

357
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,753
- There's no such thing as vampires.
- I know what I saw, professor.

358
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,832
She's lost a lot of blood,
and the transfusion didn't <i>work...</i>

359
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,754
...because she's infected
by some weird strain of rabies.

360
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,832
Rabies?

361
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,389
You might wanna have a word
with your buddy Lex Luthor.

362
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,832
- Lex?
- Yeah, ask him about Project 1138.

363
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,555
You got that just from
looking at chloe's chart?

364
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,320
I recognize the symptoms
from my research at LuthorCorp.

365
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,392
Now, you wanna play 20 Questions
or save your friend's life?

366
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,231
How could you be so stupid?

367
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,870
You never leave anyone alive.
You have to finish them off.

368
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,600
Or turn them by making them
drink your blood.

369
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,478
Oh, that guy Carlos saw you.

370
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,471
- His name's clark.
- Oh, whatever.

371
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,349
He saw you feeding.
And he was sneaking around my room.

372
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,239
That's two strikes.
I'm not waiting for a third.

373
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,118
- He's my boyfriend.
- So?

374
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,113
Lana, you are going
to live forever now.

375
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,558
He's gonna get old and withered and sag
in places you don't wanna see sagging.

376
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,711
You're special, he's not. Deal.

377
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,632
What are you gonna do to him?

378
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,351
Me? Oh, honey,
this is your freshman mess.

379
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,954
Find Clark and bring him back here...

380
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,795
...with just enough life in him
so we can all have a taste...

381
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,676
<i>...or</i> you're the one
we'll be feeding off of tonight.

382
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,114
Lex.

383
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,511
Project 1138, what is it?

384
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,192
- I never heard of it.
- Don't lie to me.

385
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,311
I know it has
something to do with rabies.

386
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,994
Chloe's in the hospital
dying from it right now.

387
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,475
And I think Lana's been infected too.

388
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,350
- Lana?
- No more games.

389
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,876
If you know anything about what's
going on, you gotta tell me right now.

390
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,917
Before it's too late.

391
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,559
Six years ago,
a girl named Buffy Sanders...

392
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,518
...was trapped in a cave
outside Smallville for several days.

393
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,159
I know, Lex. I read the article.

394
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,198
- Certain facts never made it to the press.
- Like what?

395
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,916
LuthorCorp aided in her rescue.
After she was transported to hospital...

396
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,237
...the site was discovered
to possess unusual characteristics.

397
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,714
Lex, quit dancing around.

398
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,235
- What did LuthorCorp find?
- Meteor rocks.

399
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,628
They had soaked into the water table,
creating infected stalactites...

400
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,157
...which, in turn, affected the indigenous
animal life, <i>Desmodus rotundus.</i>

401
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,878
Vampire bats.

402
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,190
So we are dealing with vampires.

403
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,430
There's nothing
mystical about this, Clark.

404
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,591
It's just a very unusual disease.

405
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,076
One of the LuthorCorp researchers
was bitten...

406
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,391
...and developed unusual strength,
an aversion to bright light...

407
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,477
...and adaptive canine teeth.
- Fangs?

408
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,268
It seemed to help
with the cannibalistic tendencies.

409
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,434
What happened to him, Lex?

410
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,676
He retired to Sausalito...

411
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,717
...after we cured him.

412
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,633
We were able to create a serum
that reverses the infection.

413
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,193
The stalactite keeps the serum active.

414
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,915
It must be administered
directly into the heart...

415
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,714
...to be carried
through the bloodstream effectively.

416
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,312
Clark, are you all right?

417
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,151
Lana?

418
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,950
I'm sorry it has to be this way, clark.

419
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,672
But we don't always
get to choose who we are.

420
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,953
Sometimes our destiny leads us
to places that we don't wanna go.

421
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,588
And there's
nothing we can do about it.

422
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,630
- Lana, no.
- I love you, Clark.

423
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,392
I always will.

424
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,553
Buffy was wrong about you, Clark.

425
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,949
You are special, aren't you?

426
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,750
Nice work. He's quite a catch.

427
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,394
One hundred percent
corn-fed Kansas beef.

428
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,596
Let's eat.

429
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,119
Wait, isn't there something else
we can do with him?

430
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,552
Like what? Barbecue?

431
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,910
No, like convert him.

432
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,399
Into one of us.

433
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,796
We're a sorority, not a fraternity.

434
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,632
No boys allowed.

435
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,674
- You don't understand. He's special.
- Not to me.

436
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,438
- Get out of the way.
- No.

437
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,953
Excuse me.

438
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,071
He's mine. You're not touching him.

439
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,677
I'm really disappointed in you, Lana.

440
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,114
Looks like you're not
Tri Psi material after all.

441
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,798
Looks like I'm making the rules now.

442
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,439
Anyone have a problem with that?

443
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,437
- No. It's great.
- Yeah, congratulations.

444
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,231
Get out. Get out!

445
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,555
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

446
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,712
Clark.

447
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,000
Clark, it's okay. I'm here.

448
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,115
Listen to me. You're sick.

449
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,278
No. No, I'm not.

450
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,839
I've never felt better.

451
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,671
Clark, I know what's inside of you.

452
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,310
I've felt your strength.

453
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,550
And now I want you to feel mine.

454
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,911
No. No, this is not who you are.

455
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,670
But maybe it is.

456
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,678
Maybe I've been
hiding it from you all along.

457
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,790
Just like you were hiding
who you really are from me.

458
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,559
No, please.

459
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,756
Clark, don't fight it.

460
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,520
We're meant to be together.
You know that in your heart.

461
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,672
And this way we can be. Forever.

462
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,998
All it takes is one drop of blood.

463
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,474
Lana, no.

464
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,991
<i>So the Tri Psis</i>
<i>got booted off campus...</i>

465
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,549
<i>... and the infected girls</i>
<i>were treated by LuthorCorp.</i>

466
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,553
<i>My roommate was so freaked out</i>
<i>that she transferred to NYU...</i>

467
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,996
<i>... which means Lana and I
<i>are once again under the same roof.</i>

468
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,670
<i>As for Clark and Lana,</i>
<i>they seem to be able to survive anything.</i>

469
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,638
How much of what happened
do you remember?

470
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,918
Bits and pieces.
Nothing coherent, thank God.

471
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,675
But there...
There was one thing that stuck with me.

472
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,438
Something I felt when I bit you.

473
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,037
What was that?

474
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,517
Warmth.

475
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,437
And love.

476
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,353
And an overwhelming
feeling of strength.

477
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,159
I think for a moment
I felt what was inside your heart.

478
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,348
And I've never felt closer to someone
in my entire life.

479
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,914
I miss being with you, Clark.

480
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,592
How's Lana?

481
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,837
She's back to normal, same as chloe.

482
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,955
Things haven't been great between us,
but I wanna say I appreciate your help.

483
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,916
That means a lot to me, Clark.

484
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,679
There is something
I'm still curious about.

485
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,230
How did you know
about Project 1138?

486
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,837
- Does it matter?
- Only if it came from Professor Fine.

487
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,473
What do you have against him?

488
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,990
Clark, he's the one
who's been attacking me.

489
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,875
Is that why you stopped by his lecture?
Force him to stop looking at LuthorCorp?

490
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,634
He's doing a lot more than looking.

491
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,758
He's obtaining highly classified
proprietary documents.

492
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,196
- He's only after the truth.
- I think he's after more than that.

493
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,868
Look...

494
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,678
...just be careful.

495
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,877
I don't believe Fine
is the friend you think he is.

496
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,437
<i>The most exciting part</i>
<i>of completing a story is not finishing it...</i>

497
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,795
<i>... but having someone else read it.</i>

498
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,990
Is that a good "hmm"
or a bad "hmm"?

499
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,116
No, it's a good "hmm."

500
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,273
If we printed tabloid nonsense
like <i>The Inquisitor</i> does.

501
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,510
But we're the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

502
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,433
And tall tales about slaying
Buffy the vampire...

503
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,591
...don't make it into a real newspaper.

504
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,274
Ms. Kahn, I didn't make this up.

505
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,670
They weren't vampires
of the mythical sense...

506
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,990
...they were victims
of an unusual disease.

507
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,515
Look, here, it's all the research.

508
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,719
Interviews, eyewitness accounts,
the CDC report, everything.

509
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,511
- Was that a good "hmm" or a bad...?
- Shut up.

510
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,554
Here's the thing. Your writing shows
you're not completely without talent.

511
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,869
Thank you.

512
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,794
But you're not
a real reporter either. Yet.

513
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,349
Well, everyone has to start somewhere.

514
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,358
Welcome to the <i>Daily Planet,</i> kid.

515
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,873
Oh, my God.

516
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,589
Thank you so much. Where do I start?

517
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,031
Same place I did. At the bottom.

518
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,189
<i>She never did print the article,</i>
<i>but I don 't care.</i>

519
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,591
<i>I got in on the ground floor</i>
<i>of my dream.</i>

520
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,198
<i>Okay, so it's actually the basement.</i>
<i>But it's the</i> Daily Planet.

521
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,672
<i>The paper of record for kings,</i>
<i>presidents and prime ministers.</i>

522
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,229
<i>Not to mention future superheroes.</i>

523
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,960
<i>The way I look at it,</i>
<i>I had no place to go...</i>

524
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,477
<i>... but up, up and away.</i>

525
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,551
