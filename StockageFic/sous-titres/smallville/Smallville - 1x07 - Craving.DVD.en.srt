1
00:00:20,842 --> 00:00:24,107
You know, if you're not in the mood
for my spaghetti...

2
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:26,076
...we could always order in Thai.

3
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:27,874
No spaghetti, no Thai.

4
00:00:28,049 --> 00:00:30,813
I wanna look good for
Lana's birthday party.

5
00:00:31,352 --> 00:00:35,152
I just think that maybe you're focusing
a little too hard on this one party.

6
00:00:35,323 --> 00:00:38,315
It's not just the party, it's everything.
It's....

7
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:40,393
Nobody likes me.

8
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:43,291
And why should they? I'm a cow.

9
00:00:44,198 --> 00:00:47,861
But, I've got a new plan.

10
00:00:48,036 --> 00:00:51,597
From now on, no more food. Just this.

11
00:01:13,294 --> 00:01:16,786
Cutting the heads off supermodels.
It's kind of redundant, isn't it?

12
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:21,432
Just looking for outfit ideas.

13
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,900
I still don't have anything to wear
to Lana's party.

14
00:01:25,073 --> 00:01:26,267
What's up?

15
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:29,672
Pete and I were hoping you could
give us a quick algebra download.

16
00:01:29,844 --> 00:01:32,312
I thought Clark usually helps you guys.

17
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,007
He's a little preoccupied
helping the birthday girl.

18
00:01:36,617 --> 00:01:39,017
We'll even buy you lunch.

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,454
That looks...appetizing.

20
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:53,429
Losing weight is never pretty.

21
00:01:55,903 --> 00:01:57,632
Ross, we're getting a game together.

22
00:01:57,805 --> 00:02:00,330
Do you want in, or do you want
to keep whale-watching?

23
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,009
Dustin, back off.

24
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:07,606
Chill out, cool guy. I didn't know
you were a chubby-chaser.

25
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,617
-Jodi, wait.
-Oh, man.

26
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:20,488
You'd think someone that big
would have a thicker skin.

27
00:02:22,363 --> 00:02:25,628
You'd think someone that stupid
would have a thicker head.

28
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,834
Jodi, we talked about this.
Starving yourself isn't the way.

29
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,171
I'm tired of waiting.

30
00:02:38,346 --> 00:02:42,783
Waiting and weighing and keeping
a diary of everything that I eat...

31
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,475
...so that I can feel guilty
if I have one extra grape.

32
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:49,919
I understand all of that, but you can't
just stop eating. It's not healthy.

33
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:57,524
Honey, you're beautiful already.

34
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,134
Just like your mother.

35
00:03:00,635 --> 00:03:02,694
No, Dad. I'm not.

36
00:03:03,271 --> 00:03:05,671
Mom wasn't fat.

37
00:05:20,174 --> 00:05:22,108
Okay, that's enough.

38
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:25,277
Done already?

39
00:05:25,846 --> 00:05:27,609
Your heart can go on
like that forever.

40
00:05:27,782 --> 00:05:28,874
Good.

41
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,985
I don't want to go through
this physical nonsense for five years.

42
00:05:32,153 --> 00:05:33,552
Well, let's hope not.

43
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:35,882
There is one thing I need
to talk to you about.

44
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:40,050
Your blood work came in. You have
an unusually elevated white-cell count.

45
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:42,719
What, like leukemia?

46
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:44,558
That's not likely. I don't get sick.

47
00:05:44,732 --> 00:05:47,166
-Are you on any medication?
-Nope.

48
00:05:47,335 --> 00:05:48,802
-Do you have any allergies?
-No.

49
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,665
Childhood illness?

50
00:05:52,106 --> 00:05:53,937
-Asthma.
-When did that stop?

51
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:57,906
The day I lost my hair.
Is this going somewhere?

52
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,172
If this were anywhere else,
I'd order a battery of tests.

53
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:02,282
But I do see a lot of this in Smallville.

54
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,418
Why should Smallville be any different?

55
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:10,922
Well, some say it's because the LuthorCorp
plant has contaminated the environment.

56
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,155
I very much doubt that.

57
00:06:18,032 --> 00:06:19,932
Let's order those tests.

58
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:28,669
Now, I want this to be special.

59
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:31,175
What do you think about
a three-tier birthday cake?

60
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:33,108
Thanks for the lifeline.

61
00:06:33,281 --> 00:06:36,273
It's a math midterm. I didn't pull you
out of a burning building.

62
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,680
-I still appreciate it.
-Lana?

63
00:06:38,853 --> 00:06:41,048
I wanted to get your opinion
on the balloons.

64
00:06:41,222 --> 00:06:43,417
Now, I think white always looks good.

65
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:46,560
-Works for me.
-Okay.

66
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:50,864
This whole birthday extravaganza
has been pretty distracting.

67
00:06:51,032 --> 00:06:54,331
Having a birthday party at Lex's mansion
seems pretty cool to me.

68
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:57,062
It stopped being my party a long time ago.

69
00:06:57,938 --> 00:07:01,567
If it was up to me, it would be pizza
and loud music with my friends.

70
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:04,608
Did you tell Nell that?

71
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:09,048
We've been through a lot the past few
months. I figure I should give her this one.

72
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:12,209
Lana, guess what.

73
00:07:12,386 --> 00:07:14,411
The scout called!

74
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:18,490
-I got the tryout with Kansas State.
-That's incredible!

75
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:20,024
Hey, congrats.

76
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:22,760
I haven't said yes yet.

77
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,262
They want me there on Saturday,
your big night.

78
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:28,766
It's Nell's big night. I was just
telling Clark it wasn't important.

79
00:07:29,637 --> 00:07:31,298
Yeah, Scout's honor.

80
00:07:31,672 --> 00:07:33,572
I want you to go.

81
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:42,346
Hey, I'll catch up with you guys later.

82
00:07:43,117 --> 00:07:45,881
<i>Clark, I'm telling you,
this is good news for you.</i>

83
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:49,921
Kansas State gives Whitney a full scholarship
and Lana gives him a tongue bath.

84
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:51,115
How is that good news?

85
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:53,852
Even I'm having a hard time
following this skewed logic.

86
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:57,361
Lana's going to be dateless
for her own party.

87
00:07:57,965 --> 00:07:58,954
Hi, Pete.

88
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:05,195
Jodi?

89
00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:09,406
You look....

90
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:10,976
Thinner?

91
00:08:12,012 --> 00:08:15,175
I was still looking for a euphemism,
but, yeah.

92
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:16,816
-Are you okay?
-Never better.

93
00:08:16,984 --> 00:08:20,886
My diet's just starting to pay off.
Bought some new clothes.

94
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:22,981
You look great.

95
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,188
Thank you for sticking up for me yesterday.

96
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,419
Most people wouldn't have done that.

97
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:30,587
Most people can't stand Dustin.

98
00:08:30,765 --> 00:08:32,164
Yeah.

99
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:38,764
Listen. I was wondering,
do you have a date for Lana's party?

100
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:45,477
No, he's still free.

101
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,744
Would you like to go with me?

102
00:08:53,654 --> 00:08:55,315
He'd love to.

103
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:58,287
Great. Okay, well, I'll see you later.

104
00:09:01,095 --> 00:09:02,858
Bye.

105
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:08,231
I don't get it.

106
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,634
Women dig me. Get used to it.

107
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:15,003
No, I mean Jodi. It's like
she lost that weight overnight.

108
00:09:15,176 --> 00:09:18,907
If she could do that, half the school
would be after that secret. Come on.

109
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:20,774
Let's go.

110
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,148
-Hello.
-Lana, hi. Come in.

111
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:26,684
Hey.

112
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:28,879
Lana, can I interest you in a latte?

113
00:09:29,056 --> 00:09:32,150
I'll pass. Bad waitressing flashbacks.

114
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:34,487
I brought over the produce order
for the party.

115
00:09:34,662 --> 00:09:38,029
-You could have called it in.
-And miss a chance to get out of the house?

116
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:40,633
Nell's planning this party
like a royal wedding.

117
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:42,826
Oh, yeah, I can tell.

118
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:47,835
Dad, I got the posts in the west field.

119
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:51,466
I hit some granite, but I jammed it through.

120
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:56,542
Very impressive.

121
00:09:57,985 --> 00:09:59,316
I had a sledgehammer.

122
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:05,489
Somebody's gotta work around here.

123
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,563
Thought you'd be posing
for ice sculptures by now.

124
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:14,325
I'm hiding out.

125
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:18,033
You have my sympathies.
Whitney's not even here for backup.

126
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:22,198
I know. I was contemplating stowing away
in the back of his truck on Saturday.

127
00:10:22,376 --> 00:10:25,243
A no-show at your own party.
That would keep the town talking.

128
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:27,073
I wouldn't do that to Nell.

129
00:10:27,248 --> 00:10:30,217
It's just, all this attention
is a little unnerving.

130
00:10:30,784 --> 00:10:33,617
Well, if you like,
I could be your escort on Saturday.

131
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:40,553
You know, so I can fend off
the throngs of adoring fans.

132
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:44,629
-I'd like that.
-Great.

133
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:48,098
I better go.

134
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:51,932
If I'm away too long, Nell will
probably send out a search party.

135
00:10:53,707 --> 00:10:55,197
And Clark....

136
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,310
Promise me you'll make it this time.

137
00:10:59,246 --> 00:11:00,440
I promise.

138
00:11:04,418 --> 00:11:06,283
-Thanks.
-Bye.

139
00:11:10,124 --> 00:11:13,093
Escort to fend off the adoring fans?

140
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,252
-What's wrong with that?
-Nothing, Clark.

141
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:18,889
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

142
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:21,660
Mom, Lana and I are just friends.

143
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:23,495
Okay.

144
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:25,434
I'm officially butting out.

145
00:11:25,606 --> 00:11:27,733
So, what are you gonna get her
for her birthday?

146
00:11:27,908 --> 00:11:29,375
I don't know.

147
00:11:29,977 --> 00:11:31,604
Any ideas?

148
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:36,239
My mother always said the best gifts
come from the heart.

149
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:44,087
Jodi, you feeling okay?
You look a little....

150
00:11:44,258 --> 00:11:46,624
Yeah, don't worry, Dad, I'm feeling great.

151
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:49,285
I even got a date for Lana's party.

152
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:51,693
Jodi, that's terrific.

153
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:56,996
But I want you to eat something more
than those shake things, all right?

154
00:11:57,171 --> 00:11:59,264
You know what? I will.

155
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,704
I'm done counting calories.

156
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,342
I've gotta go.

157
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:07,912
-Don't stay up too late.
-Okay.

158
00:12:09,883 --> 00:12:11,407
Bye!

159
00:15:26,914 --> 00:15:28,882
Getting your morning Lana fix?

160
00:15:30,884 --> 00:15:32,374
Chloe, don't you ever knock?

161
00:15:32,553 --> 00:15:34,851
It's a barn, Clark.

162
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:39,389
Is there a reason you're here early,
or do you just enjoy busting my chops?

163
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,584
A little of both.

164
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:44,162
Did you hear about the accident last night?
A deer was hit out on Route 5.

165
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:48,131
-It's not exactly "Wall of Weird" material.
-Check out the paper.

166
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:51,533
Animal Control said that
the deer died of causes unknown.

167
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:53,036
So?

168
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,234
Not much unknown about
a bumper at 60 miles per hour.

169
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,675
I'd love to run down theories with you,
but I've got chores to do.

170
00:16:00,514 --> 00:16:03,540
And I still haven't figured out
what to get Lana for her birthday.

171
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:06,618
Well, you or your family knows
people at Animal Control, right?

172
00:16:06,787 --> 00:16:08,311
One perk of growing up on a farm.

173
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:10,581
I was thinking we could
stop by before school.

174
00:16:10,757 --> 00:16:13,089
You could use your pull,
take a couple of pictures.

175
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,626
I'll help you out with
your gift-giving dilemma.

176
00:16:16,563 --> 00:16:19,794
Okay, but I want it to be something unique.

177
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:23,832
Just don't make it as unique
as what you gave me last year.

178
00:16:24,004 --> 00:16:27,201
Very impressive use of pull:
"Can I use your bathroom?"

179
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:29,535
I can't believe
we're looking for road kill.

180
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,938
The deer's in there.

181
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:34,378
The door's locked.

182
00:16:35,515 --> 00:16:37,676
I'm gonna go find a maintenance worker.

183
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,987
Chloe, it's open.

184
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:48,551
How'd you do that?

185
00:16:48,729 --> 00:16:50,356
Kent charm.

186
00:17:01,842 --> 00:17:03,707
Lift it up. Go.

187
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:08,078
Looks like jerky.

188
00:17:14,454 --> 00:17:18,049
The lab report says the deer lost
something like 80 percent of its body fat.

189
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:21,186
It's like it's been liposuctioned to death.

190
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:24,659
What do you think it is?
Some fat-sucking vampire in town?

191
00:17:25,632 --> 00:17:29,898
This is Smallville, Clark.
Land of the weird, home of the strange.

192
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:58,088
Jodi, honey, are you--?
Are you okay in there?

193
00:17:58,265 --> 00:18:00,062
Yeah, Dad, I'm fine.

194
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:02,428
Well, I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

195
00:18:02,602 --> 00:18:06,504
I've gotta go to Metropolis for a few days
or I'm going to lose this client.

196
00:18:06,673 --> 00:18:08,504
When will you be back?

197
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:12,771
Not till Sunday morning, which means
I'm gonna miss your big date.

198
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:15,814
It's okay, it's no big deal.

199
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:20,117
Well, do you think maybe
I could see you before I leave?

200
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:24,490
I'm kind of indecent at the moment.

201
00:18:27,694 --> 00:18:31,562
Honey, I think that maybe
we need to talk to somebody.

202
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:33,757
I don't need a shrink.

203
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:38,530
I just want you to look in a mirror
and be happy.

204
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:45,708
Daddy, I am.

205
00:19:14,841 --> 00:19:17,639
Most of my friends are trying
to get out of high school.

206
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:19,608
I was meeting with your principal.

207
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,476
Apparently, you guys are
in dire need of a new computer lab.

208
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:24,014
I figured I could help.

209
00:19:24,184 --> 00:19:27,210
They might even
name a lunch special after you.

210
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:30,720
-How'd you end up here?
-My plant manager, Gabe.

211
00:19:30,891 --> 00:19:34,554
<i>He's always going on about his daughter,
the reporter on the Torch.</i>

212
00:19:34,728 --> 00:19:36,525
Thought I'd drop by and say hello.

213
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:40,097
-She wasn't around, but I was struck by this.
-That's Chloe's hobby.

214
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:43,998
She thinks she can trace all the freak
things in Smallville to the meteor shower.

215
00:19:44,171 --> 00:19:46,002
Interesting theory.

216
00:19:46,173 --> 00:19:48,471
Most people think it's crazy.

217
00:19:48,642 --> 00:19:50,041
Maybe.

218
00:19:50,811 --> 00:19:53,575
Do you remember where you were
when they fell?

219
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:55,915
Not really.

220
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,510
-My parents hadn't adopted me yet.
-I do.

221
00:20:00,353 --> 00:20:02,617
I was right here in Smallville.

222
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:06,088
My mother wanted me to spend
some quality time with my dad.

223
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:08,591
He brought me here on a business trip.

224
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:12,323
Just a quick hop to Smallville
to finalize a deal.

225
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:15,561
Funny how one day
can change your whole life.

226
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:17,759
What happened?

227
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:21,930
I was out in a corn field
when the first meteor hit.

228
00:20:23,577 --> 00:20:27,035
It was like a tidal wave coming at me.

229
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:30,450
Then everything went black.

230
00:20:31,551 --> 00:20:36,011
Next thing I remember, I was waking up
in Metropolis General completely bald.

231
00:20:37,757 --> 00:20:39,247
Lex, I didn't know.

232
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:43,259
Not many people do, Clark.

233
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:47,366
I should have died that day.
Instead, I walked away with this.

234
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:50,731
-I'm sorry.
-Why? It's not your fault.

235
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:54,839
When I was younger,
I thought it was a curse.

236
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:58,104
Kids figured I was a freak or on chemo.

237
00:20:58,979 --> 00:21:01,209
Then I began to see it as my gift.

238
00:21:01,381 --> 00:21:03,906
The thing that defined me,
that gave me strength.

239
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:06,575
You ever wonder what you'd be like?

240
00:21:07,154 --> 00:21:09,179
You know, if you hadn't come that day?

241
00:21:09,556 --> 00:21:11,387
It doesn't matter, Clark. It happened.

242
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:15,084
Personally, I think my future's
gonna be brighter...

243
00:21:15,262 --> 00:21:18,459
...than that spoiled rich brat
that walked into that corn field.

244
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,792
Mr. Luthor.

245
00:21:24,237 --> 00:21:25,636
It's Lex.

246
00:21:27,073 --> 00:21:29,633
Clark was just telling me
your meteor theory. I like it.

247
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:30,798
Thanks.

248
00:21:30,977 --> 00:21:33,946
Especially since most people think
my company's behind everything...

249
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:37,242
-...that goes wrong in Smallville.
-That's the reigning theory.

250
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:40,147
Are you the only one
that blames the meteors instead of me?

251
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,618
Pretty much. Well, there is Mr. Hamilton.

252
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:47,317
Except most don't have high regard for a guy
who sells plastic meteor chips to tourists.

253
00:21:47,494 --> 00:21:50,088
Doesn't exactly inspire confidence.

254
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:55,224
<i>Call me when you're looking for a summer
job. I've got friends over at the Inquisitor.</i>

255
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:56,994
I'll see you tomorrow.

256
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,037
I hear you're escorting
the birthday girl. Nice work.

257
00:22:01,575 --> 00:22:03,133
We're just going as friends.

258
00:22:04,611 --> 00:22:08,047
Sure you are. Hope you got her a nice gift.

259
00:22:10,016 --> 00:22:11,347
Yeah.

260
00:22:12,085 --> 00:22:14,485
Jodi, I didn't see you in class. Are you okay?

261
00:22:14,654 --> 00:22:18,647
Yeah, I'm fine, just stomach flu.
I can't keep anything down.

262
00:22:18,825 --> 00:22:22,056
-Maybe you should go see the nurse.
-I've got it under control.

263
00:22:22,896 --> 00:22:24,295
Are you sure you're okay?

264
00:22:24,464 --> 00:22:27,695
I'm fine. I just need to rest up
for tomorrow night.

265
00:22:28,602 --> 00:22:29,830
Look.

266
00:22:30,003 --> 00:22:32,494
If you don't feel up to it, I'll understand.

267
00:22:33,907 --> 00:22:35,602
Are you kidding?

268
00:22:35,775 --> 00:22:37,936
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

269
00:22:47,754 --> 00:22:50,382
Hey, Jodi. I've been watching you.

270
00:22:50,557 --> 00:22:52,286
I bet you have.

271
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:54,154
Hitting the gym was a good idea.

272
00:22:54,794 --> 00:22:56,785
You should take your own advice.

273
00:22:58,164 --> 00:23:00,029
Whoa. You all right?

274
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:05,962
I'm just a little hungry.

275
00:23:14,381 --> 00:23:17,441
You like what you see?

276
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,548
Totally.

277
00:23:23,323 --> 00:23:28,727
I'll bet you wouldn't mind seeing
a little bit more, would you?

278
00:23:30,864 --> 00:23:33,196
Follow me.

279
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:41,032
<i>-Confederacy of Dunces.
-First edition.</i>

280
00:23:41,941 --> 00:23:45,308
-Early birthday gift?
-From Whitney. I couldn't believe it.

281
00:23:46,913 --> 00:23:48,107
It's a cool gift.

282
00:23:48,715 --> 00:23:52,276
That's the thing with Whitney. Sometimes
I think he's a million miles away...

283
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:55,615
...and then he surprises me
with something like this.

284
00:24:00,727 --> 00:24:03,719
-How are things on the party front?
-I surrendered.

285
00:24:03,897 --> 00:24:06,559
I told Nell to make
the final decisions without me.

286
00:24:06,733 --> 00:24:08,758
I cannot believe how anti-birthday you are.

287
00:24:08,935 --> 00:24:11,369
-Haven't you ever had a happy birthday?
-Once.

288
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:13,461
Went to a drive-in.

289
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:18,501
-That doesn't sound like Nell's style.
-I was with my parents.

290
00:24:18,678 --> 00:24:24,116
My dad pulled the car up to the first row
so the screen filled up the entire windshield.

291
00:24:25,418 --> 00:24:29,684
I remember feeling all grown up because
I got to sit in the front seat with them.

292
00:24:29,856 --> 00:24:33,622
They played Bugs Bunny cartoons
before the movie started.

293
00:24:33,793 --> 00:24:37,422
I was cold, so my mom
wrapped me up in her sweater.

294
00:24:38,498 --> 00:24:39,658
That sounds nice.

295
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:42,563
I fell asleep before the movie even started...

296
00:24:42,736 --> 00:24:44,670
...between my mom and dad.

297
00:24:46,506 --> 00:24:50,533
It's the last time I can remember
feeling completely safe.

298
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,507
That's a great memory.

299
00:25:10,663 --> 00:25:11,994
Hey.

300
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:16,665
-We're fine. No one's gonna see us.
-Good.

301
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:28,875
You don't think I ever meant that stuff
I said about you when you were--?

302
00:25:29,048 --> 00:25:30,447
Fat?

303
00:25:31,351 --> 00:25:33,319
You thought it was funny...

304
00:25:33,486 --> 00:25:37,923
...calling me names, making me cry...

305
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:41,458
...making me wish
that I were dead rather than fat.

306
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,722
-Well, what can I say?
-You can say you're sorry.

307
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:40,977
Help me.

308
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,630
Don't touch that.

309
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:30,792
You're not sterile and you're not me.

310
00:27:31,304 --> 00:27:33,135
My apologies, Dr. Hamilton.

311
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:36,702
You don't have a website, do you?

312
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:38,070
Excuse me?

313
00:27:38,244 --> 00:27:42,874
They're usually the ones who track me down.
The freaks with websites.

314
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:45,313
I'm just a fan.

315
00:27:45,485 --> 00:27:47,009
Lex Luthor.

316
00:27:47,954 --> 00:27:50,013
The billionaire's son.

317
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,148
Mineralogists don't have fans.

318
00:27:58,031 --> 00:28:00,966
<i>Most mineralogists didn't handle
the first Apollo moon rocks.</i>

319
00:28:01,134 --> 00:28:04,797
That was a lifetime ago
when I was a respectable scientist.

320
00:28:06,472 --> 00:28:09,066
You know, we may have
a few things in common.

321
00:28:09,242 --> 00:28:12,405
I was kicked out
of Metropolis University too.

322
00:28:15,448 --> 00:28:18,110
Ever since I found out about
a medical condition I have...

323
00:28:18,284 --> 00:28:20,946
...I've become very interested
in your work, Dr. Hamilton.

324
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,055
And you think it has
something to do with the meteors.

325
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:29,353
Isn't that your theory? The meteors
somehow alter cellular makeup?

326
00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:32,726
That sounds to me
like research worth funding.

327
00:28:35,234 --> 00:28:40,171
Yes, well, sorry. My funding is private,
and so are my results.

328
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,240
Your funding comes from tourists.

329
00:28:42,408 --> 00:28:46,504
If you are so interested in meteors,
here, take one.

330
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,171
Enjoy it. I have nothing else for sale.

331
00:28:51,618 --> 00:28:54,644
When you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

332
00:29:02,161 --> 00:29:04,254
I called the hospital. Dustin's in a coma.

333
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:08,025
His body went into shock with the loss
of fat. He hasn't told the police anything.

334
00:29:08,201 --> 00:29:10,499
Time to revisit
the fat-sucking vampire theory.

335
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,867
You know, if you hadn't been there,
he probably would have died, Clark.

336
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,804
I can't figure out why anybody
would want to steal body fat.

337
00:29:16,976 --> 00:29:19,536
I know. It takes eating disorders
to a whole new level.

338
00:29:20,847 --> 00:29:21,973
Jodi.

339
00:29:22,515 --> 00:29:25,780
-Hi, guys, what's up?
-Study group, remember?

340
00:29:27,353 --> 00:29:29,617
Totally slipped my mind.

341
00:29:31,024 --> 00:29:33,458
So no more veggie shakes, huh?

342
00:29:36,663 --> 00:29:39,530
Are you feeling okay?
Pete said you felt sick yesterday.

343
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:41,489
Oh, that.

344
00:29:42,135 --> 00:29:43,625
I'm fully recovered.

345
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,808
I guess it's safe to say
that the diet's finally over.

346
00:29:50,576 --> 00:29:53,909
I'm starving.
I haven't eaten anything all day.

347
00:29:58,618 --> 00:30:01,985
I'm just a little nervous
about the party tonight.

348
00:30:03,189 --> 00:30:04,417
Yeah.

349
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:20,631
I'll see you guys tonight.

350
00:30:29,716 --> 00:30:32,879
-Okay, what was that about?
-I don't know.

351
00:30:34,187 --> 00:30:37,350
-I gotta fly. We'll talk about this later?
-Okay.

352
00:30:37,523 --> 00:30:40,822
-Hey, where are you going?
-I'm still working on Lana's birthday gift.

353
00:30:40,993 --> 00:30:42,119
Any hints?

354
00:30:42,295 --> 00:30:45,196
Yeah. It's not a gift certificate.

355
00:31:05,017 --> 00:31:06,541
What do you think?

356
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:08,880
-It's really....
-Not you at all.

357
00:31:10,723 --> 00:31:13,248
I heard the quarterback
couldn't make it. Too bad.

358
00:31:13,426 --> 00:31:15,724
I knew you'd be devastated.

359
00:31:15,895 --> 00:31:18,830
Whitney's trying out for a football
scholarship to Kansas State.

360
00:31:18,998 --> 00:31:21,228
He didn't think he made the cut,
but someone fell out.

361
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,731
I know.

362
00:31:24,504 --> 00:31:26,438
Your aunt told me.

363
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:30,869
I like your new escort better.

364
00:31:32,245 --> 00:31:33,872
Have fun tonight.

365
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:42,221
-Mom, you almost done?
-Relax, Clark.

366
00:31:42,388 --> 00:31:44,515
You're not going to be late for once.

367
00:31:45,057 --> 00:31:47,582
By the way, did you figure out
what to get Lana?

368
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,421
Yeah, Lex helped me out.

369
00:31:49,595 --> 00:31:51,290
So, what is it?

370
00:31:51,898 --> 00:31:54,093
I thought you were butting out of this.

371
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,194
Then you better learn how to iron.

372
00:31:58,404 --> 00:32:00,429
-Hi, Chloe.
-Hi, Mrs. Kent.

373
00:32:00,606 --> 00:32:03,473
-You've gotta take a look at this.
-Why aren't you dressed?

374
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:06,771
I didn't have time. You really,
really need to check this out.

375
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,281
"Smallville Body and Fender.
Replace windshield, replace side-panels.

376
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,216
-Cause of accident, impact with deer"?
-It was Jodi's car, Clark.

377
00:32:15,388 --> 00:32:19,722
-What do you think happened to her?
-Her house is right next to a big meteor hit.

378
00:32:19,892 --> 00:32:21,985
She lost all that weight...

379
00:32:22,161 --> 00:32:25,096
...by drinking juice from vegetables
grown in her greenhouse.

380
00:32:25,264 --> 00:32:28,722
She's losing weight too fast
to keep up with regular food.

381
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:31,062
-And that's why she needs body fat.
-Exactly.

382
00:32:31,237 --> 00:32:33,068
We need to find her.

383
00:32:33,506 --> 00:32:36,737
Jodi wouldn't let anything keep her
from getting to that party.

384
00:32:37,777 --> 00:32:38,766
Pete.

385
00:32:49,755 --> 00:32:51,313
Perfect.

386
00:32:58,497 --> 00:33:00,192
-Hi.
-Hi.

387
00:33:00,366 --> 00:33:02,926
Perfect flowers for a perfect date.

388
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:10,938
They're beautiful, Pete.

389
00:33:11,577 --> 00:33:13,340
So is that dress.

390
00:33:13,946 --> 00:33:15,971
Thanks. It was my mom's.

391
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,651
Is something wrong?

392
00:33:23,556 --> 00:33:26,320
I'm fine. I just need to eat.

393
00:33:32,698 --> 00:33:36,031
That doesn't sound right.
Maybe we should go to the hospital.

394
00:33:38,771 --> 00:33:41,706
You've always been good to me, Pete.

395
00:33:41,874 --> 00:33:43,171
-Please go away now.
-Jodi.

396
00:33:44,377 --> 00:33:46,174
Go away.

397
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:48,641
Jodi, wait!

398
00:33:51,717 --> 00:33:52,945
Jodi!

399
00:33:54,854 --> 00:33:56,253
Jodi, come on!

400
00:33:57,723 --> 00:33:59,190
Jodi.

401
00:34:02,328 --> 00:34:03,989
Jodi?

402
00:34:08,467 --> 00:34:10,025
Jodi, where are you?

403
00:34:12,371 --> 00:34:14,703
Pete, please get away.

404
00:34:16,042 --> 00:34:18,476
-It's all my fault.
-Jodi?

405
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:23,110
I just wanted to be thin.
There's only so much a person can take.

406
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:26,384
Pete, please go home.

407
00:34:26,552 --> 00:34:28,884
Come on, Jodi, you don't have to hide.

408
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:32,617
I don't wanna hurt you.

409
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:35,124
Come on, Jodi, you couldn't hurt a--

410
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:45,701
Just tell me what's happening.

411
00:34:45,871 --> 00:34:48,499
Please leave.

412
00:35:13,299 --> 00:35:14,288
Jodi?

413
00:35:16,502 --> 00:35:17,696
Pete!

414
00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:29,043
Pete, are you okay?
Pete, what's wrong?

415
00:35:40,993 --> 00:35:42,051
Jodi!

416
00:35:52,071 --> 00:35:55,234
-Why can't you just leave me alone?
-You're sick.

417
00:35:55,408 --> 00:35:57,569
Whatever you did to yourself,
you can get help.

418
00:35:57,743 --> 00:35:59,768
All I wanted was to be thin.

419
00:36:13,025 --> 00:36:14,492
Jodi, this isn't you.

420
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:19,257
What, isn't this
what I'm supposed to look like?

421
00:36:44,824 --> 00:36:48,021
Look at me. I'm a freak.

422
00:36:51,864 --> 00:36:53,798
I know how to stop this for good.

423
00:37:00,473 --> 00:37:01,770
Wait!

424
00:37:17,089 --> 00:37:18,920
Jodi?

425
00:37:33,005 --> 00:37:35,701
Pete! Get over here, quick!

426
00:37:37,209 --> 00:37:38,437
Clark?

427
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,649
Is she okay?

428
00:37:45,818 --> 00:37:49,083
I think so, but we need
to get her to a hospital.

429
00:38:07,373 --> 00:38:09,136
Sneaking out, huh?

430
00:38:09,742 --> 00:38:11,573
Isn't this your shindig?

431
00:38:11,844 --> 00:38:15,575
-Says so on all the invitations.
-Right.

432
00:38:17,049 --> 00:38:20,041
You're not hiding,
you're getting some air.

433
00:38:22,555 --> 00:38:25,956
I spent 18 years of Luthor
Christmas parties in the coatroom.

434
00:38:28,027 --> 00:38:30,222
Still waiting for my reinforcements.

435
00:38:32,097 --> 00:38:34,657
I know Clark, he'll be here...

436
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:38,325
-...if he can.
-It's just a birthday.

437
00:39:07,866 --> 00:39:09,891
Clark, what happened?
The police called.

438
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:12,094
-I'm fine.
-How's Pete?

439
00:39:12,271 --> 00:39:15,365
He's got a serious migraine,
but other than that, he's okay.

440
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:19,033
Jodi's on the way to Metropolis General.
Her father's gonna meet her there.

441
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:21,679
Clark, I'm sorry about the party.

442
00:39:21,847 --> 00:39:24,213
I promised Lana I'd be there.

443
00:39:25,851 --> 00:39:27,375
I can't believe I let her down.

444
00:39:27,553 --> 00:39:30,249
Well, when you do the things you do,
son, helping people...

445
00:39:30,422 --> 00:39:32,322
...sometimes you have to make sacrifices.

446
00:39:32,491 --> 00:39:34,482
-Like Lana?
-Maybe...

447
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,288
...but you made your choice.

448
00:39:38,864 --> 00:39:40,422
Where are you going?

449
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,999
I don't have to sacrifice everything.

450
00:40:12,931 --> 00:40:14,421
Back for some more rocks?

451
00:40:15,801 --> 00:40:17,735
Apparently, I have a clean bill of health.

452
00:40:17,903 --> 00:40:21,395
Congratulations. I guess that means
you won't be bothering me anymore.

453
00:40:21,674 --> 00:40:24,700
I couldn't figure out why
you're so resistant to accept my help...

454
00:40:24,877 --> 00:40:27,107
...then I had a friend do some digging.

455
00:40:28,047 --> 00:40:33,280
I thought you got kicked out of Metropolis
University for your meteor theories.

456
00:40:33,452 --> 00:40:36,910
But apparently it was
your student-teacher relations.

457
00:40:37,523 --> 00:40:39,991
I wonder if the Smallville Police
had you register.

458
00:40:43,729 --> 00:40:44,991
Get out.

459
00:40:50,235 --> 00:40:52,499
I want you to look at something.

460
00:40:57,309 --> 00:41:01,370
I don't care about the past.
I believe in the power to reinvent yourself.

461
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,107
You want to prove
you've been right all along?

462
00:41:04,283 --> 00:41:06,183
That check should cover your vindication.

463
00:41:08,253 --> 00:41:11,814
What you're looking for could take years.

464
00:41:14,226 --> 00:41:16,285
I'm a patient man.

465
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:24,135
Tell me, why does a billionaire's son
care so much about a bunch of rocks...

466
00:41:24,303 --> 00:41:26,737
...that fell out of the sky 12 years ago?

467
00:41:27,473 --> 00:41:30,965
I save that story for the people I trust.

468
00:41:51,597 --> 00:41:53,394
Kind of missed cocktail hour.

469
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,890
I'm sorry.

470
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:01,230
I told you I stopped believing
in happy birthdays a long time ago.

471
00:42:02,941 --> 00:42:05,307
Well, maybe I can change that.

472
00:42:07,379 --> 00:42:11,110
Okay, I know I blew it tonight,
but at least let me give you your present.

473
00:42:12,117 --> 00:42:13,448
When?

474
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:15,377
Now.

475
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:28,899
Pass the popcorn.

476
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,230
-Lana.
-Yes?

477
00:42:37,209 --> 00:42:39,374
Happy birthday.

478
00:43:47,179 --> 00:43:49,170
