1
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,141
So how'd you get out of gym class?

2
00:00:13,315 --> 00:00:17,376
Spared the sweats for a couple of days,
the perk of chairing the blood drive.

3
00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:20,613
I'm sorry. Aren't you the girl
who skinned her knee in 7th grade...

4
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,283
-...and passed out when she saw the blood?
-I was hoping I'd live that down, but yeah.

5
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:28,487
Clark, you're gonna be late.
We gotta hit the showers.

6
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:33,861
-Bye, Lana.
-Bye.

7
00:00:40,276 --> 00:00:42,608
-Troy, give it back!
-Amy, just hang on.

8
00:00:42,778 --> 00:00:45,269
Just want to see if you wrote
anything about me.

9
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:50,211
Jeff, you know your sister's writing
psycho love letters to Lex Luthor?

10
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:53,780
-It's always the quiet ones.
-Give it back to her.

11
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:56,321
It's not my fault
you've got a weirdo for a sister.

12
00:00:56,492 --> 00:00:57,959
You're a child, Troy.

13
00:00:58,127 --> 00:01:01,927
It's because of boys like you
that girls want a man like Lex Luthor.

14
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:05,759
Keep dreaming, Amy.
Your parents clean his bathrooms.

15
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:08,631
You may live there,
but Luthor won't slum it with the help.

16
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:10,465
Just leave her alone.

17
00:01:11,507 --> 00:01:13,168
What are you gonna do about it?

18
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,840
Losers.

19
00:01:24,486 --> 00:01:27,046
So when are you donating blood?

20
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,779
I don't know.

21
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:33,588
Come on, Clark. Selflessly giving of yourself
to save others, girls love that.

22
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:39,466
You okay?

23
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:41,796
Yeah, I'm fine.

24
00:02:02,992 --> 00:02:04,926
Very funny, guys.

25
00:02:22,578 --> 00:02:23,943
Stop it!

26
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:26,538
Troy, you okay?

27
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,609
What happened?

28
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,749
It attacked me.

29
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:38,152
It was like a ghost.

30
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:44,086
So you didn't see anything?

31
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:46,659
When I got there,
Troy was already on the floor.

32
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,888
What about the voice he heard?

33
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:51,362
Are you thinking
the locker room's haunted?

34
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:54,866
Not unless the meteor rocks conjure up
ghosts of departed jockstraps...

35
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:57,164
...which I seriously doubt.

36
00:03:57,339 --> 00:04:00,934
Thank you. Well, it's nice
to see you still have your standards.

37
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,305
I don't have time right now.

38
00:04:03,612 --> 00:04:06,945
If you don't want to help me
with this blood drive, then just say so.

39
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:09,277
-That's not it.
-That doesn't look pretty.

40
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:10,713
Then what is it?

41
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:13,013
I really don't wanna talk
about this now, okay?

42
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:15,952
No, it's not okay.
You have been avoiding me for a week.

43
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,219
Every time I ask you what's wrong,
you push me away.

44
00:04:21,063 --> 00:04:22,690
I'm worried about you.

45
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:24,893
Don't be.

46
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:27,026
I just need some space.

47
00:04:28,637 --> 00:04:31,834
If that's what you want, fine.
But if you can't even confide in me...

48
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:34,942
...I don't know why we're going out
in the first place.

49
00:04:37,446 --> 00:04:39,676
Quick, pretend we weren't watching.

50
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:44,483
Hey, Lana, how's it going?

51
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:47,816
Not great, but thanks
for the courtesy clueless.

52
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,823
Would it cheer you up if we offered
to volunteer a pint tomorrow?

53
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:53,920
Let's find out.
How about 9:45? That's open.

54
00:04:54,096 --> 00:04:56,428
-Cool.
-There, better already.

55
00:04:56,598 --> 00:04:59,624
Clark, what time can we schedule you?

56
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:04,367
We didn't pick a time for you yet.
When can I put you down?

57
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,802
Actually, I'm not sure.

58
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:08,937
Can I get back to you?

59
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:12,444
Sure, not a problem.

60
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:15,245
Well, I mean, I figure I could help out.

61
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:17,248
Sign people up, pass out cookies.

62
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:20,253
That'd be great. Thanks.

63
00:05:21,256 --> 00:05:22,746
Bye.

64
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:27,518
Okay, nice recovery.
But am I to assume...

65
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:31,462
...that your offer to help isn't completely
without an ulterior motive?

66
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:34,769
I'm just being a good friend.

67
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:37,305
Okay.

68
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,665
Yes, Daddy, we're on schedule.

69
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:45,876
Lex is playing hard to get,
but I'm sure I can make him come around.

70
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:48,576
Bye, Daddy.

71
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:53,147
He wants to know if you're selling
this castle after we sell out your father.

72
00:05:53,322 --> 00:05:56,723
Why? Does he want to ship it
back over to Scotland?

73
00:06:07,503 --> 00:06:10,131
Amy, where's your mom?

74
00:06:10,772 --> 00:06:13,240
Flu, I think. She asked me
to cover for the afternoon.

75
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:14,807
Have you met Victoria?

76
00:06:15,878 --> 00:06:19,177
-No, not officially.
-She's gonna be staying with us.

77
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:24,646
I am so sorry.

78
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:31,159
I'll go get something to clean this up.

79
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:34,456
She spilled that on purpose!

80
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:38,362
That was a mistake. Wasn't it, Amy?

81
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,191
Sure.

82
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:44,962
She's clearly got a thing for you, Lex.

83
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:47,399
Never took you for the jealous type.

84
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:53,904
Her parents are a fixture.
I brought them here from Metropolis.

85
00:06:54,082 --> 00:06:56,312
Then send them back.

86
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:06,720
Were you just in the house?

87
00:07:08,964 --> 00:07:10,397
Amy.

88
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:17,403
Amy, I asked you a question.

89
00:07:17,906 --> 00:07:21,137
-What's going on?
-Your sister was bothering Mr. Luthor.

90
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,642
If anyone is bothering him,
it's that tramp.

91
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:26,212
She's ruining everything.
She wants him all to herself.

92
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:31,216
We may live on the Luthor estate,
but we're not part of that world.

93
00:07:31,386 --> 00:07:34,116
You have to know your place.

94
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,121
Both of you.

95
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,727
Don't worry, Mom.
We know exactly what our place is.

96
00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:51,771
Thanks, Jeff.

97
00:07:52,007 --> 00:07:53,838
Just be careful.

98
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:19,024
Clark, what's this?

99
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:21,897
Blood drive at school.
Lana's running it.

100
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,937
-Clark, you know you can't donate.
-I know, Dad.

101
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:26,165
What do I tell her?

102
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:29,242
That you have a problem with needles,
which you technically do.

103
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:33,745
Great. Not only do I lie,
but I look like a wuss.

104
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:42,813
I can't even believe
I'm actually gonna say this...

105
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:46,786
...but I guess you can't always
be honest with people.

106
00:08:47,462 --> 00:08:50,124
It's one of the prices you pay
for your abilities.

107
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:51,560
That's why I volunteered.

108
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:55,032
I'm sure it had nothing to do with the fact
that Lana is running it.

109
00:08:55,203 --> 00:08:57,728
-Whitney dropped out.
-So you thought you'd move in.

110
00:08:59,574 --> 00:09:02,566
If he doesn't see how great she is,
then he doesn't deserve her.

111
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:28,261
Looking for something?

112
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:31,366
My watch.

113
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:34,164
-Tulips look great.
-Yeah, you cleaned us out.

114
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:37,238
Mom said if you want some more,
you have to call Holland.

115
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:39,213
They're Victoria's favorite.

116
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:48,249
What was that?

117
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:06,968
You and Victoria
must be getting pretty close.

118
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,502
You seem surprised.

119
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:12,973
She just doesn't seem like your type.

120
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,283
Relationships aren't always
about love, Clark.

121
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:21,479
Sometimes they're about mutual goals.
Not every girl is Lana Lang.

122
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:25,986
Sorry, it's none of my business, really.

123
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:29,828
It's okay. I admire your standards.

124
00:10:29,998 --> 00:10:31,761
Don't lose that.

125
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:38,265
I decided to fight for Lana.

126
00:10:41,143 --> 00:10:43,008
Good for you.

127
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:45,336
Why the new attitude?

128
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:47,778
I decided to take the advice of a friend.

129
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:53,347
Don't you have another watch?

130
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:56,514
I've got hundreds.

131
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:01,528
This one's special. My mother gave it
to me right before she died.

132
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:11,730
I don't see it.

133
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:14,274
What are you, part bloodhound?

134
00:11:15,777 --> 00:11:18,337
No, I live on a farm.

135
00:11:19,314 --> 00:11:22,374
I'm pretty good at finding needles
in haystacks.

136
00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:26,482
How about I go check the library?

137
00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:02,918
-What's going on?
-Wait here.

138
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:05,146
Doesn't leave much room
for interpretation.

139
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:07,477
It was pretty weird.

140
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:09,283
I mean, the door was shaking.

141
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:14,360
When we got close, it blew open.
Lex said he felt something brush past him.

142
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:17,225
Maybe the Scottish castle
came complete with a poltergeist.

143
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,764
The police say it's vandals.

144
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:22,734
They don't know many ghosts who write
in spray paint and own a black light.

145
00:13:26,408 --> 00:13:28,672
So how's the blood drive?

146
00:13:29,144 --> 00:13:31,203
Lana and I are getting together tonight.

147
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:33,137
-At her place?
-Yeah.

148
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:34,905
That's very romantic.

149
00:13:37,786 --> 00:13:39,014
Just remember, Clark...

150
00:13:39,187 --> 00:13:43,851
...once you cross that line, you can't hide
behind the cloak of friendship anymore.

151
00:13:44,526 --> 00:13:46,517
Proceed with caution.

152
00:13:55,937 --> 00:13:57,564
Lex...

153
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:02,310
...you have disappointed me.

154
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:05,105
Hi, Dad. It's good to see you too.

155
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,339
Would you mind telling me
what she's doing here?

156
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:12,418
Right now? Working on my neck.
But knowing her, I think that's just a start.

157
00:14:14,656 --> 00:14:18,820
Could this be a ploy to get my attention?

158
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:20,617
Well done. It worked.

159
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:24,663
I know this will come as a shock, but not
everything in my life revolves around you.

160
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:28,234
I understand.
So you're simply being swindled.

161
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:34,475
Would you excuse us, Miss Hardwick?

162
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:38,271
My son and I are gonna have
a little chat about family loyalty.

163
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:40,205
It's all right.

164
00:14:40,715 --> 00:14:42,979
I'll run us a bath.

165
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:49,320
I'll be there shortly.

166
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:54,025
I'll send Sir Harry your regards.

167
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:55,321
Swell.

168
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:01,231
This is hardly business.

169
00:15:01,436 --> 00:15:04,428
Generations of Luthors would beg to differ.

170
00:15:04,606 --> 00:15:09,339
It's always business, especially
where the Hardwicks are concerned.

171
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:13,680
Lex, can't you see
she was sent to distract you?

172
00:15:13,848 --> 00:15:17,306
Sir Harry has been nipping away
at LuthorCorp for months.

173
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:19,643
LuthorCorp is your company.

174
00:15:21,222 --> 00:15:24,123
I'm just one of its
many expendable employees...

175
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:27,955
...as you made abundantly clear when
you exiled me to this charming cow town.

176
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,729
Empires are not brought down
by outside forces.

177
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,028
They are destroyed
by weaknesses from within!

178
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,971
Lex, I've told you this...

179
00:15:40,141 --> 00:15:44,271
...Smallville is your test.
Right now, you're failing.

180
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:46,641
Thanks for the update,
but I know what I'm doing.

181
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:48,143
No, you don't.

182
00:15:48,316 --> 00:15:52,946
She is playing the only card she's got, and
you are falling for it hook, line and sinker.

183
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:55,214
My personal life is my business.

184
00:15:55,457 --> 00:15:59,894
Not when it affects my company.
Then it's my business.

185
00:16:03,364 --> 00:16:05,093
Listen to this.

186
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:11,569
If you sell out your family,
then you will truly be alone in the world.

187
00:16:16,511 --> 00:16:18,376
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--

188
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:21,839
You don't deserve him.

189
00:16:30,258 --> 00:16:35,127
-Amy, hey, what's wrong?
-Her. What do you think?

190
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:36,558
Amy?

191
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,035
I've got an opening at 5.

192
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:47,072
I can shift mine to 4:30 at Station B.

193
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:49,670
-Which makes us--
-Done.

194
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:52,705
You're kidding. Everything?

195
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,872
We own this town.

196
00:16:56,851 --> 00:16:59,649
We never found a time for you to donate.

197
00:17:01,122 --> 00:17:05,286
Actually, Lana,
I have a confession to make.

198
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:08,426
I've got this thing about needles.

199
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,827
It's kind of embarrassing.

200
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:14,765
Don't worry about it.
Your secret's safe with me.

201
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:19,871
You are such a lifesaver, Clark.

202
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:23,409
It's amazing you do
all these different things.

203
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:25,375
Trying to find my place in the world.

204
00:17:28,116 --> 00:17:29,981
Can't thank you enough.

205
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:32,576
It's a great cause. How can I not help?

206
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:35,615
Ask Whitney. He's....

207
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:39,488
I don't know where he's been lately.

208
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:42,888
You know, Lana,
if you really want to thank me...

209
00:17:43,631 --> 00:17:45,155
...don't talk about Whitney.

210
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:49,530
Fair enough.

211
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:58,809
Did you ever think it's strange that
my dad and your aunt used to date?

212
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:01,546
Nell doesn't really talk about it much.

213
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:04,116
Whatever happened,
I guess she took it kind of hard.

214
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:06,850
I'm just glad that you and I are so close.

215
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:09,923
Me too.

216
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:16,153
That's the thing about Clark Kent.
He's not always there when you want him...

217
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:19,667
...but he's always there
when you need him.

218
00:18:21,135 --> 00:18:22,932
It's a fine distinction.

219
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:26,905
You're the one who's helping me
with the pledge drive.

220
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:29,870
I am.

221
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:34,139
You're the one who listens.

222
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:38,380
I do.

223
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,188
You're the one who's here.

224
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:43,422
Yeah.

225
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:48,222
Lana, you still at it?

226
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:53,300
Clark, do you have the time?

227
00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:57,396
No, but I'm guessing it's late.

228
00:18:57,805 --> 00:18:59,568
Smart kid.

229
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,217
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Tomorrow.

230
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:19,016
Have you ever seen
the sunset from my loft?

231
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,993
Yes.

232
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:27,833
But that's the great thing about sunsets.
They're unique.

233
00:19:28,002 --> 00:19:31,802
You always see things
you've never noticed before.

234
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:35,041
You want to come over tomorrow?

235
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:37,441
I'd love to.

236
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:42,510
Good night, Clark.

237
00:19:49,157 --> 00:19:52,615
"Have you seen the sunset from my loft?"
You actually said that?

238
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:55,160
And I bet your stomach
was in knots the whole time?

239
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:58,589
If I were you, I'd start scripting
what I was going to say now.

240
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:01,564
No, I think I'll play it by ear,
fly by the seat of my pants.

241
00:20:01,736 --> 00:20:03,863
Clark, you're not the flying type.

242
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:05,835
I'll make you some notes.

243
00:20:13,114 --> 00:20:15,708
Whitney, your mother called,
and she filled me in.

244
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:18,912
She shouldn't have.

245
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:22,149
Well, Whitney, she was just concerned.

246
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:25,583
Look, I'm not here to push.

247
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,991
If you need anything,
my office is just down the hall.

248
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:30,152
Okay?

249
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:32,994
Okay.

250
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,045
Sorry.

251
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:52,775
You're welcome.

252
00:21:16,477 --> 00:21:18,945
-Hi, Clark.
-Hi, Amy.

253
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:20,771
Is everything okay?

254
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:23,109
Yeah, just...

255
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:26,515
...you know, all the weirdness
at the mansion.

256
00:21:26,788 --> 00:21:30,121
Everything was fine
until Victoria got there.

257
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:35,622
Well, you're Lex's friend.
What do you think of her?

258
00:21:35,797 --> 00:21:37,958
I really don't know her that well.

259
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,460
Well, I think I figured out
why she's sticking around.

260
00:21:42,637 --> 00:21:46,630
I saw her in Lex's bedroom
going through his things.

261
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:49,641
What were you doing in Lex's bedroom?

262
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:51,642
Helping my mom.

263
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:56,248
-And Victoria didn't see you?
-No.

264
00:21:58,286 --> 00:22:03,553
See, Lex is the only one
who ever treated me like I was there.

265
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:28,441
What brings you over so late?

266
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:31,134
-Doing a little ghost-hunting?
-No.

267
00:23:31,312 --> 00:23:33,712
I came here to talk to you about Victoria.

268
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:36,076
Where is she?

269
00:23:36,817 --> 00:23:39,513
She's taking a bath. Why?
Is there a problem?

270
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:43,623
Last night when I was in here,
I saw her....

271
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:46,791
I really don't know how to say this.

272
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:49,361
She was going through the files
on my computer?

273
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:51,759
Yeah, how'd you know?

274
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,364
Very little happens in this house
without my knowledge.

275
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:57,467
You don't seem very upset about this.

276
00:23:58,406 --> 00:24:00,931
We're playing chess, Clark.
It's a game.

277
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:03,269
Like I said, we've known
each other a long time.

278
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:06,709
Well, you don't love her.
She goes behind your back.

279
00:24:07,381 --> 00:24:11,147
-Why do you want to keep her around?
-It's complicated.

280
00:24:11,452 --> 00:24:12,851
Thanks for the heads up.

281
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:15,284
That's what friends are for.

282
00:24:16,257 --> 00:24:20,626
I guess I shouldn't even bring up
that Amy's got an obsession with you.

283
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:24,689
It's a teenage crush, nothing more.

284
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:26,958
Hey, how goes your new Lana initiative?

285
00:24:28,502 --> 00:24:30,800
I found something out about Whitney.

286
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:35,498
I saw a prescription in his bag
for Amlodipine. It's a--

287
00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:37,007
Heart medication.

288
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:42,479
My mother was on it
before she had her surgery.

289
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,049
Is that what...?

290
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:47,343
I'm sorry.

291
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:51,553
She was sick for a long time, Clark.

292
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,260
The watch I lost...

293
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:57,090
...my mom gave it to me
when she knew it was getting close.

294
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:05,197
She found a Napoleon franc from 1806
and had it made into the face.

295
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,869
Why Napoleon?

296
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:11,743
<i>You ever see the painting
of Napoleon's Coronation by David?</i>

297
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:13,372
No.

298
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:18,976
Napoleon's mother couldn't make it
to his coronation.

299
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:24,385
But when he commissioned it, Napoleon told
David to paint her in as if she were there...

300
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:26,321
...right in the center.

301
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:29,254
Even though she couldn't
be there physically...

302
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,194
...he brought her into his life
through sheer force of will.

303
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:34,928
There to share in his greatness.

304
00:25:36,871 --> 00:25:38,805
It's a good story.

305
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,774
It's a good watch.

306
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,327
Lex?

307
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:47,006
You're gonna be okay.

308
00:27:15,202 --> 00:27:16,863
It's definitely blood.

309
00:27:17,037 --> 00:27:19,505
Doesn't exactly fit the Casper paradigm.

310
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:23,541
Which means that whoever attacked
you and Victoria in the bathroom...

311
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:25,372
...was invisible?

312
00:27:33,254 --> 00:27:35,848
What's this green stuff?

313
00:27:36,757 --> 00:27:38,418
It smells like roses.

314
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,026
What happened?

315
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:48,532
I just touched it.

316
00:27:50,204 --> 00:27:53,105
Okay, I'm now officially weirded out.

317
00:27:53,274 --> 00:27:54,571
What is this?

318
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:57,072
If you rubbed that all over your body,
you'd be--

319
00:27:57,244 --> 00:27:58,506
Naked?

320
00:27:59,146 --> 00:28:00,443
You'd be invisible.

321
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:14,092
So, what's our next move?
Should we call the police?

322
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:16,422
And report an invisible person?

323
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:18,324
We need a viable suspect.

324
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:21,161
Well, who's got a problem
with Lex's British fling?

325
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:22,324
Amy Palmer.

326
00:28:22,503 --> 00:28:24,528
Her parents are on the mansion's
house staff.

327
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:27,230
Amy said she saw Victoria
snooping in Lex's bedroom.

328
00:28:27,408 --> 00:28:29,638
-She said Victoria didn't see her.
-No wonder.

329
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:33,246
-Wait. Didn't Amy give blood?
-3:45, Station B.

330
00:28:33,948 --> 00:28:37,042
You've got a freakishly good memory.

331
00:28:37,818 --> 00:28:42,755
Okay, I'll get the blood type on the broken
piece of glass and check it against Amy's.

332
00:28:43,357 --> 00:28:45,917
-Call me later?
-Top of my speed-dial.

333
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:09,447
Whatever it is, I'm not interested.

334
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:14,247
What about Lana?
You interested in her?

335
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:18,280
-What is it with you and my girlfriend, Kent?
-Nothing.

336
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,123
We're just friends.

337
00:29:21,295 --> 00:29:24,321
-Think I don't see how you look at her?
-At least I pay attention.

338
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:28,497
You've got an unbelievable girlfriend,
and you don't even know it.

339
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:32,230
-What's your problem?
-How I deal with my girl is my business.

340
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:34,135
Okay?

341
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,411
I saw the heart medication in your bag.

342
00:29:41,382 --> 00:29:42,872
What's going on, Whitney?

343
00:29:48,722 --> 00:29:50,212
It's my dad.

344
00:29:50,524 --> 00:29:53,789
He's been in Metropolis all week,
you know, for tests.

345
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:56,225
Is he gonna be okay?

346
00:29:56,497 --> 00:29:58,089
Doctors don't know.

347
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,332
You haven't told Lana yet, have you?

348
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:09,771
She's been through enough pain
in her life with her parents.

349
00:30:09,944 --> 00:30:12,174
I didn't want her to go
through it with me.

350
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:23,555
I don't think you give her
enough credit.

351
00:30:25,426 --> 00:30:26,916
She's strong.

352
00:30:27,094 --> 00:30:29,460
She'd probably understand
better than anyone.

353
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:47,971
Hey, how's Victoria?

354
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:53,580
She's resting up in Metropolis for a few days
until I can get some answers.

355
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,389
Everything okay?

356
00:30:58,926 --> 00:31:00,917
You ever gotten information
you wish you hadn't?

357
00:31:01,795 --> 00:31:05,424
In my experience, there's no such thing
as too much information.

358
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,658
I assume you're talking
about the quarterback?

359
00:31:08,168 --> 00:31:09,635
His father's sick.

360
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:13,731
That's too bad.

361
00:31:15,142 --> 00:31:17,303
I wanted to take my shot
with Lana, but now--

362
00:31:17,478 --> 00:31:19,343
You feel like you'd be taking advantage.

363
00:31:20,647 --> 00:31:25,107
-What would you do?
-Who, me? I'd go for it.

364
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:28,984
See, but that's what I like about
you, Clark. You wouldn't.

365
00:31:32,526 --> 00:31:34,221
Hi, Lex.

366
00:31:34,628 --> 00:31:37,256
Amy, this is a surprise.

367
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:42,630
Well, I just saw your car outside,
so I thought I'd come in and say hi.

368
00:31:43,937 --> 00:31:46,132
Well, I appreciate the gesture.

369
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:51,105
So now that Miss Hardwick's gone,
hopefully things will be back to normal.

370
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:53,974
Victoria will be back in a few days.

371
00:31:56,817 --> 00:31:58,876
She's really not as bad as you think.

372
00:31:59,286 --> 00:32:02,414
I never thought that.

373
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:07,084
Well, bye.

374
00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:16,563
What is it?

375
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:19,628
I don't know what to say, Mr. Luthor.

376
00:32:20,874 --> 00:32:22,899
Amy's been having trouble in school...

377
00:32:23,077 --> 00:32:26,046
...but I can't imagine
she'd try to hurt Miss Hardwick.

378
00:32:34,988 --> 00:32:36,546
I hope I'm wrong.

379
00:32:45,332 --> 00:32:48,165
Looks like she's been collecting you.

380
00:32:52,673 --> 00:32:54,231
My watch.

381
00:32:55,442 --> 00:32:58,206
We had no idea, Mr. Luthor.

382
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:01,075
Please don't call the police.

383
00:33:02,683 --> 00:33:08,019
I'm not interested in retribution or publicity,
but Amy needs help.

384
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:11,851
Counseling, medical treatment,
whatever it takes, just send me the bill.

385
00:33:12,726 --> 00:33:16,184
Even so, I think it'd be best for everyone
if you left the mansion tonight.

386
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,191
Yes, of course.

387
00:33:46,393 --> 00:33:47,883
You made it.

388
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:50,091
Sorry I'm late.

389
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:52,432
It's just getting to the good part.

390
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:03,740
What do you think?

391
00:34:05,979 --> 00:34:08,812
I think it's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

392
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:19,185
The other night on the porch,
I felt you were trying to tell me something.

393
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,883
I was.

394
00:34:21,995 --> 00:34:25,123
But Nell's timing was impeccable,
as always.

395
00:34:27,701 --> 00:34:29,760
She's not here now.

396
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:35,137
What I wanted to tell you was....

397
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,577
What I wanted to say was...

398
00:34:46,486 --> 00:34:48,977
...I would never do anything to hurt you.

399
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:50,487
I know that.

400
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:55,116
But if I said what I really wanted
to say right now, that's what I'd do.

401
00:34:55,295 --> 00:34:56,421
I'd hurt you.

402
00:34:58,031 --> 00:35:00,397
Why don't you take a shot?

403
00:35:00,634 --> 00:35:02,499
I'm pretty strong.

404
00:35:02,669 --> 00:35:06,435
I know, but I think Whitney
needs to know that too.

405
00:35:07,074 --> 00:35:10,066
I thought you didn't want
to talk about Whitney.

406
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:16,442
I don't.

407
00:35:18,318 --> 00:35:21,617
But if you were my girlfriend
standing in Whitney's loft...

408
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:24,120
...l'd hope he'd say the same thing.

409
00:35:27,728 --> 00:35:29,958
I understand you're mad at him...

410
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:34,396
...but you need to talk to him. He needs
you right now. He just doesn't know it.

411
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,898
Clark, why are you doing this?

412
00:35:44,945 --> 00:35:50,178
Because after all this time, you and I are
finally friends, and I don't wanna lose that.

413
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,818
Look.

414
00:36:03,397 --> 00:36:05,024
We missed it.

415
00:36:44,004 --> 00:36:47,770
I just wanted to feel close to you.

416
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:05,116
Jeff is gonna pack everything else.

417
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:08,261
My husband will be back
in the morning to pick it up.

418
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:13,028
-Again, Mr. Luthor, l--
-It's okay. It's okay.

419
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:15,358
Drive safely.

420
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:40,556
Yes, I'd like to leave a message
for Victoria Hardwick.

421
00:37:45,966 --> 00:37:47,627
Who's there?

422
00:37:49,136 --> 00:37:51,104
Come out and show yourself.

423
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,779
How'd it go with Lana?

424
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,153
We're still friends.

425
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:15,726
-Are you okay with that?
-No.

426
00:38:16,663 --> 00:38:19,291
But I think it's the right call for now.

427
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:22,590
Hello?

428
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,597
Hey, Mrs. Kent.

429
00:38:25,772 --> 00:38:27,899
Hi, Chloe. Well, I'll see you later.

430
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:32,406
Okay, so, bad news on the Dracula front.

431
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:34,547
The drop of blood
on the mirror was type A.

432
00:38:34,714 --> 00:38:35,942
Amy Palmer was type O.

433
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:38,716
But she had a shrine
to Lex in her room.

434
00:38:38,885 --> 00:38:42,412
She may be a little Lex-obsessed, but
she's not the one that tried to off Victoria.

435
00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:44,454
Check the paper.

436
00:38:47,027 --> 00:38:49,587
Amy's blood type doesn't match,
but look at Jeff's.

437
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:52,260
Her brother?
He's always been so quiet.

438
00:38:52,966 --> 00:38:54,399
Practically invisible.

439
00:38:55,936 --> 00:38:58,063
I'll catch up with you later.

440
00:39:04,911 --> 00:39:09,678
Don't you understand? She loved you.

441
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,444
How could you send her away?

442
00:39:13,253 --> 00:39:16,518
-Who are you?
-Suddenly, you care.

443
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:21,150
Master Lex with his castle,
his plant, his expensive cars.

444
00:39:21,328 --> 00:39:24,320
When did people ever mattered to you?

445
00:39:24,931 --> 00:39:26,694
Jeff?

446
00:39:28,068 --> 00:39:29,865
Where are you?

447
00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:37,232
Servants are supposed to be invisible.

448
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:41,474
We tried to hide,
fade into the woodwork.

449
00:39:41,648 --> 00:39:45,243
My parents lived with it, pretended
it didn't matter, but Amy wanted more.

450
00:39:45,418 --> 00:39:47,113
And I'm through pretending!

451
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:54,693
What have I ever done to you?

452
00:39:58,298 --> 00:40:00,960
You threw her out like she was nothing.

453
00:40:01,134 --> 00:40:05,468
-I thought she was attacking Victoria.
-That was me. I wanted to scare her.

454
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,004
Make her leave.

455
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:11,473
I wanted everything back to the way it was
for Amy, but you're not interested in love.

456
00:40:11,645 --> 00:40:14,079
That kind of love could get me arrested.

457
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:16,738
She's a little young for me, Jeff.

458
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:19,886
You ruined her life!

459
00:40:20,053 --> 00:40:22,078
Our lives!

460
00:40:22,255 --> 00:40:24,917
I'm not gonna let you hurt her again!

461
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,163
Lex! It's me. Open up!

462
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:51,849
Stay away from him, Kent.

463
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:57,080
This is your fault too.

464
00:40:58,558 --> 00:41:01,527
Jeff, what happened?

465
00:41:01,761 --> 00:41:03,820
Chemistry, Kent.

466
00:41:03,997 --> 00:41:07,125
Some plants don't absorb light,
they refract it.

467
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,428
I found a weird green rose
on the grounds, and I studied it.

468
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:13,971
And then I used the oils
to become what I've always been...

469
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:16,940
...to Lex, to the people at school...

470
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,441
...everyone.

471
00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:31,385
Like you're something special.

472
00:41:31,558 --> 00:41:33,753
Well, I'm special too.

473
00:42:02,422 --> 00:42:04,686
What do you think's
gonna happen to Jeff?

474
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:07,156
A lot of serious therapy.

475
00:42:07,827 --> 00:42:10,819
The bigger question is
how he made himself invisible.

476
00:42:10,997 --> 00:42:14,364
I don't know. I guess
the secret's gonna stay with him.

477
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:17,829
-How's your head?
-I've survived worse.

478
00:42:18,104 --> 00:42:20,732
Can't say the same about
my father's antique collection.

479
00:42:20,907 --> 00:42:23,467
-Sorry.
-Don't be.

480
00:42:23,643 --> 00:42:25,736
My mother always hated that room.

481
00:42:25,912 --> 00:42:29,780
"War's in our nature," she said.
"We don't need to put it on display."

482
