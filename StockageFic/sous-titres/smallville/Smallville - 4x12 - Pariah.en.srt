1
00:00:02,258 --> 00:00:03,700
Previously on "smallville"...

2
00:00:05,651 --> 00:00:09,130
you ran off with a girl
you barely know and got married.

3
00:00:09,372 --> 00:00:12,079
It wasn't legal.
I was on red kryptonite, mom.

4
00:00:12,114 --> 00:00:13,776
Jason, what's really going on here?

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,298
Where this is heading with us,
I just don't think you're ready.

6
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:21,031
There's a part of me that never feels freer
than when I'm with alicia.

7
00:00:21,078 --> 00:00:25,027
You know what she did. She tried
to kill lana, and she tried to kill you.

8
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:26,772
Alicia needs to be in an institution.

9
00:00:26,796 --> 00:00:28,162
Why'd they let her out of belle reve?

10
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:31,794
A little something my doctor came up with.
It keeps me from using my powers.

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,222
Why did you just walk out
on this relationship?

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,863
I think that my mother arranged it.

13
00:00:35,913 --> 00:00:38,057
You don't even see
what you did was wrong!

14
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:39,938
You dosed me with red kryptonite!

15
00:00:39,984 --> 00:00:43,138
Look, I know that we can never be
together after what I did.

16
00:00:43,184 --> 00:00:46,969
Whatever's going on, it doesn't change
the way that I feel about you.

17
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:51,937
I love you, clark. For as long as I live,
I'm never gonna reveal your secret.

18
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:58,210
I love rock 'n' roll so put another
dime in the jukebox, baby.

19
00:00:58,257 --> 00:01:04,252
I love rock 'n' roll so come and
take your time and dance with me.

20
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:11,815
He smiled, so I got up
and asked for his name.

21
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:13,142
You. Right there.

22
00:01:13,177 --> 00:01:16,676
Said it doesn't matter 'cause
he said that it's all the same.

23
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:18,203
Yeah Lois!

24
00:01:18,238 --> 00:01:23,864
I said, can I take you home?
Where we can be alone

25
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:30,136
and then we were movin' on
and he was with me, yeah, me

26
00:01:30,202 --> 00:01:35,557
next we were movin' on, and
he was with me yeah, me... singin'

27
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:40,567
I love rock 'n' roll so put another
dime in the jukebox, baby.

28
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:46,144
I love rock 'n' roll so come and
take your time and dance with me.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,339
first he married the girl,
now he's dating her?

30
00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:01,739
That was subtle, lois.
Right. Good.

31
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,223
I think I've seen enough for one night.

32
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:17,592
Lana, wait.

33
00:02:20,823 --> 00:02:23,302
- I just want to apologize.
- For what?

34
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,809
trying to kill me or not succeeding?

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,809
Look, all I want is a chance
to prove to you who I really am.

36
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:32,102
You already have.

37
00:02:38,872 --> 00:02:41,087
- I can't believe you brought her here.
- Jason, listen...

38
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:43,626
listen to what... another apology?

39
00:02:44,149 --> 00:02:48,072
You think just 'cause she says she's better
that everything's going to be okay?

40
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:50,257
Come on, man.

41
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,793
Lana?

42
00:04:19,455 --> 00:04:20,516
Lana?

43
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:26,716
Hey.

44
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:30,470
Lana?

45
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:33,147
Hey, can you hear me?

46
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:39,577
Lana.

47
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,470
Lana, look at me.

48
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:49,131

52
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:47,874
How is lana?
Is she okay?

53
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:50,137
Hey, clark, yeah,
she's... she's fine.

54
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:53,675
I mean, lucky for her, jason pulled a T.J. Hooker
and broke her bathroom door down.

55
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:57,954
Only to discover that lana's mystery assailant
had somehow flown the coop.

56
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,215
So, have they arrested
your arm ornament yet?

57
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:02,661
What?

58
00:06:02,707 --> 00:06:08,502
Sheriff adams was just here, and she spent a lot of time
focusing on the "attacked in a locked room" scenario.

59
00:06:08,548 --> 00:06:12,933
And the name alicia baker came up...
more than once in a bunny boiler kind of way.

60
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:15,164
Alicia didn't do this.

61
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,613
Ever since her release from belle reve, she's been wearing
a lead bracelet. It prevents her from using her abilities.

62
00:06:19,674 --> 00:06:24,167
And did she also happen to be wearing anything
low-cut when she spun you that tale, 'cause

63
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:26,613
I'm not sure you're thinking
with your big brain here.

64
00:06:26,674 --> 00:06:32,736
Clark, just because alicia says that the bracelet keeps her
from teleporting doesn't mean that it's the truth.

65
00:06:32,797 --> 00:06:36,228
She was with me when lana got attacked.
I was saying good night in grandville.

66
00:06:36,274 --> 00:06:41,797
Every second? You have to admit that
she can transport easier than captain kirk.

67
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:46,335
And she did try to carve herself a jack-o-lana before,
cut and dry... emphasis on the "cut. "

68
00:06:46,397 --> 00:06:50,212
I'm telling you, alicia couldn't have done this.
I know her.

69
00:07:02,617 --> 00:07:03,525
Clark...

70
00:07:05,094 --> 00:07:07,171
lana doesn't want to see you.

71
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:17,886
I'm getting a funny sense
of déjà vu here, mr. Kent.

72
00:07:17,947 --> 00:07:20,317
Haven't we acted out
this particular charade before?

73
00:07:20,363 --> 00:07:23,224
This is different, sheriff.
Alicia did not attack lana.

74
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,624
She was with me.

75
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:29,178
I better not find out you're covering
for that girlfriend of yours, mr. Kent.

76
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,963
Having you as an alibi is the only thing
keeping me from tossing her tail in jail.

77
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,877
Sheriff adams already has
alicia tried and convicted.

78
00:07:46,923 --> 00:07:48,523
Sheriff adams has a point, clark.

79
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,308
First las vegas, and now an assault charge.
What are you doing with this girl, clark?

80
00:07:52,354 --> 00:07:53,693
Alicia didn't do this.

81
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:58,077
Son, your girlfriend has problems, and this relationship
is not healthy. Why can't you see that?

82
00:07:58,108 --> 00:08:01,323
You always told me to look for
the good in people, to believe in them,

83
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:03,200
and alicia deserves a second chance.

84
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:06,492
Why do you continue to see her
knowing how we feel?

85
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:10,009
She kept my secret.
She got shot protecting me.

86
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:12,271
What else does she have to do
to prove herself?

87
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:14,148
What if she did this, clark?

88
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:17,932
What if she attacked lana
the way she did before?

89
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:27,371
Ever thought about getting out more?

90
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:31,509
This coming from the hotshot college student
who ran away from college this weekend.

91
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:33,570
- It's greek week.
- So?

92
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:37,970
So they're wearing their letters on their shirts,
they sing group songs...

93
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,463
the fraternities are having
a power puking contest.

94
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:42,151
Oh, okay. Enough said.

95
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:45,186
I don't understand why you
came out to smallville, though.

96
00:08:45,247 --> 00:08:48,601
Well, believe it or not,
I like spending time with you, little cousin.

97
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:52,171
Although, that doesn't mean I'm ready
to buy into your "meteors make freaks" theory.

98
00:08:52,217 --> 00:08:56,494
It's not just a theory, lois.
Alicia baker tried to kill my best friend twice,

99
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,909
and it was because of her meteor-induced abilities
that she was able to do that.

100
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:03,026
Did you know that lana's
bathroom door was locked?

101
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:05,642
Who else could've gotten in or out,
for that matter?

102
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:07,288
That's what I want to know.

103
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:10,980
Chloe, we need to find out if there's anybody else
in smallville who has abilities similar to alicia's.

104
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:15,819
Clark, I'm sorry, but even if there was someone else
like alicia, what would they have against lana?

105
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:19,003
Hey, I finished that op-ed piece, chloe.

106
00:09:19,065 --> 00:09:20,111
Great.

107
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:22,280
- Hey, lois.
- Hi.

108
00:09:23,065 --> 00:09:26,388
I had a feeling I'd bump into you here. Um,

109
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,173
I was wondering if, uh,
you'd like to maybe

110
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:34,460
have a cup of coffee
or something with me, maybe.

111
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:35,752
Coffee?

112
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,245
You know, lois was just saying
she needs to get out more.

113
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:42,532
I... I... look

114
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:44,302
excellent, it's a date.

115
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:46,578
"Smallville's glory days"

116
00:09:48,394 --> 00:09:49,825
Sounds interesting.

117
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:53,378
I think it is, and I'll tell you
about it over coffee.

118
00:09:55,855 --> 00:10:00,720
Hey, tim, uh, you were at the talon last night.
Did you see anything... suspicious?

119
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:03,720
Um, no, nothing out of the ordinary.

120
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:08,704
But your mother... she was there. She was cleaning up,
and the blond girl that you were with was in the alley.

121
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:10,797
Maybe they saw something.

122
00:10:22,797 --> 00:10:26,228
You look like a big cat in a small cage.

123
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:30,382
You all right?

124
00:10:31,553 --> 00:10:32,753
No.

125
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:37,815
Someone saw a blond girl

126
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:41,246
in the alley behind the talon
when lana was attacked.

127
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,527
Then somebody saw another blond girl in the alley,
because it wasn't me.

128
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,820
There's bound to be suspicion, clark.

129
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:59,127
People think I did it.

130
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,666
Besides, you couldn't have done it,
because you were with me

131
00:11:03,712 --> 00:11:07,312
and you were wearing your bracelet.

132
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:17,276
Clark.

133
00:11:17,353 --> 00:11:19,061
You lied to me.

134
00:11:22,938 --> 00:11:25,600
I didn't... I didn't lie.

135
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:28,061
I didn't think I needed it.

136
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:31,261
You don't understand.

137
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:35,871
I couldn't give up my powers again.
It was worse than being in prison.

138
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,471
What would you do if somebody told you
that you couldn't use your abilities?

139
00:11:40,778 --> 00:11:42,424
I don't know.

140
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:46,070
But I would... I would give them away in a second
before I'd use them to hurt someone.

141
00:11:46,132 --> 00:11:48,178
Yeah, so would I.

142
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,968
I'm better now, clark.
You know that.

143
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:55,707
I just want people
to accept me for who I am.

144
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:58,058
I think if you're honest with yourself,

145
00:11:58,106 --> 00:12:01,779
you'll realize that deep down inside,
you want that to.

146
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:08,753
Look, I'm... so sorry that I didn't tell you
about the bracelet.

147
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:14,891
But I didn't do anything to hurt lana.

148
00:12:15,722 --> 00:12:17,322
I swear.

149
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,966
I swear.

150
00:12:27,136 --> 00:12:30,782
Jason, don't be ridiculous.
I'll be fine for a few hours.

151
00:12:30,828 --> 00:12:33,226
You do realize that you were attacked
in your own apartment

152
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,436
behind a locked door.
You want me just to leave you alone,

153
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:39,473
and spend the evening digging through
the university's microfiche? No.

154
00:12:39,543 --> 00:12:43,196
Well, I am not going
to let you flunk history.

155
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:46,366
Mom. Ready to go?

156
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:50,474
Why don't clark and I stay with lana?

157
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:59,077
I think that
that is a great idea.

158
00:13:01,185 --> 00:13:02,277
Go.

159
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:04,554
I'll be fine.

160
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,231
All right.

161
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,416
I won't be long.

162
00:14:39,224 --> 00:14:39,940
Oh...

163
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:41,732
Mom, what are you doing here?

164
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:45,329
I had to come to make sure
my son was all right.

165
00:14:45,913 --> 00:14:48,805
I phoned dr. Martin on the way here.
He can see you today.

166
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:51,128
I'm fine. I've been hurt worse in football.

167
00:14:51,175 --> 00:14:54,051
Well, it never hurts to get a second opinion
from a real doctor.

168
00:14:54,098 --> 00:14:55,990
Let it go, mom.

169
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,529
It's just hard to see you
suffering here by yourself.

170
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,421
You'd at least think
your girlfriend would be here.

171
00:15:02,498 --> 00:15:04,005
You really want to play that game?

172
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,221
This is not a game, jason. This is your life.

173
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:10,252
And I'm worried about the path
you're heading down.

174
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:12,683
Oh, you mean the path you sent me down?

175
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:14,790
What are you talking about?

176
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:19,513
Lana... the girl you made sure
I met in paris.

177
00:15:19,898 --> 00:15:22,003
Are you serious?

178
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:29,390
How could anyone maneuver two people
meeting and falling in love in paris?

179
00:15:30,932 --> 00:15:33,671
Mrs. Teague.
Um, I didn't know you were here.

180
00:15:33,702 --> 00:15:36,578
Come in, lana.
We were just talking about you.

181
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:42,081
Did, uh, jason share
his matchmaking theory with you?

182
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:44,588
Yeah, he did.

183
00:15:44,635 --> 00:15:47,712
And what did you think...
that I had somehow used my

184
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:54,547
mysterious powers to coerce you into going to paris
at exactly the same time that my son was there?

185
00:15:55,347 --> 00:15:57,193
You don't have to answer that.

186
00:15:57,255 --> 00:15:59,270
I think she already has.

187
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:02,363
Lana,

188
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:05,532
I'm not a perfect mother. I can be...

189
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:11,040
overprotective and sometimes overbearing,
especially when it comes to women in my son's life.

190
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:11,932
Mom?

191
00:16:11,978 --> 00:16:16,286
I had nothing to do
with getting the two of you together,

192
00:16:16,347 --> 00:16:18,901
as you can probably realize
from my reaction to it.

193
00:16:18,947 --> 00:16:22,562
And why my son
feels the need to blame me

194
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:24,793
for meeting you...

195
00:16:25,362 --> 00:16:28,455
is something you should be asking yourself.

196
00:16:33,562 --> 00:16:36,415
If you change your mind about the doctor,
let me know.

197
00:16:37,645 --> 00:16:39,199
Feel better?

198
00:17:17,846 --> 00:17:20,030
It won't work.

199
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,461
The one that they made me
at belle reve was special.

200
00:17:25,507 --> 00:17:31,245
It had to be able to release trace amounts of lead
into my bloodstream to dampen my abilities.

201
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:32,799
Remember?

202
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,399
I guess it's the thought that counts.

203
00:17:37,645 --> 00:17:40,476
That's a pretty ugly cut.

204
00:17:40,722 --> 00:17:42,660
Where were you last night?

205
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:46,414
I was wondering if you were
ever gonna call me again. Why?

206
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:50,522
Lana's boyfriend was attacked.

207
00:17:51,815 --> 00:17:55,153
I was the one who saved him,
and I found this in his car.

208
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:57,441
Okay, I didn't do it, clark.

209
00:17:58,564 --> 00:18:01,518
I don't know how
that got there, but I...

210
00:18:01,856 --> 00:18:02,964
it wasn't me.

211
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,395
Alicia, you have to turn yourself in.

212
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:07,272
You don't believe me.

213
00:18:07,302 --> 00:18:08,887
I want to.

214
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:11,985
I really do.
But I need to stop who's doing this.

215
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:13,895
Okay, well, then find out
who really did it.

216
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:16,951
- Everybody thinks it's you.
- Why, because of my powers?

217
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,228
Because I'm a freak?

218
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:25,105
You know what, clark? Maybe if everybody knew
your secret, you'd be a suspect, too.

219
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,566
No, alicia, this is not about your abilities.

220
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,035
That's really easy for you to say, clark.

221
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:32,158
Everybody thinks that you're normal.

222
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,173
How do you think your friends would react
if they found out that you were exactly like me?

223
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,918
We'll just go to the sheriff. We'll tell her what happened.
We'll explain everything.

224
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:41,933
She'll understand, and it'll all work out.

225
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:46,795
Just explain it to her.

226
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:50,242
All right, I'll go with you...

227
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,211
if you tell her about your powers, too.

228
00:19:00,318 --> 00:19:01,965
I can't do that.

229
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:03,611
Why not, clark?

230
00:19:03,657 --> 00:19:05,795
Don't you understand that...

231
00:19:06,164 --> 00:19:12,087
once people know the truth about us,
then they'll have to accept us for who we really are?

232
00:19:14,241 --> 00:19:15,610
I'm sorry.

233
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:17,579
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

234
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:22,810
Letting people know about us is the only way
that we're ever gonna be free, clark.

235
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:26,963
Don't hate me for wanting that.

236
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:34,794
Goodbye, clark.

237
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:36,502
Alicia...

238
00:19:57,641 --> 00:20:00,087
Mr. Kent, didn't see you there.

239
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,995
Did you come to help your mother?

240
00:20:03,718 --> 00:20:06,980
Mmm, she has almost got
that latte machine down.

241
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,503
No, sheriff, I came here to see you.

242
00:20:11,164 --> 00:20:14,995
I found this in the car
when jason was attacked.

243
00:20:16,502 --> 00:20:18,318
It belongs to alicia.

244
00:20:18,856 --> 00:20:21,554
You flip-flop more than a politician, mr. Kent.

245
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,692
So now you think
your girlfriend's guilty, huh?

246
00:20:24,985 --> 00:20:26,000
Maybe.

247
00:20:26,046 --> 00:20:28,523
Well, I hate to disappoint you, mr. Kent,

248
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:30,615
but I've already been
down that road.

249
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:34,771
Despite your claim that miss baker was with you
at the time of the first incident,

250
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,787
I yanked her in for a little dog-and-pony.

251
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:41,940
The scarf may have been there,
but your girlfriend wasn't.

252
00:20:42,387 --> 00:20:48,465
Alicia baker was locked in an interrogation room with me
at the time the second victim was attacked.

253
00:20:48,526 --> 00:20:51,495
There's no way she could've done it.

254
00:21:21,861 --> 00:21:24,322
"Can any cell hold her?"

255
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,548
Probably not.

256
00:21:28,778 --> 00:21:30,963
Alicia, what are you doing here?

257
00:21:31,732 --> 00:21:33,578
Chloe sullivan...

258
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:35,670
ace reporter.

259
00:21:36,055 --> 00:21:39,198
You write all these articles
about the people you call "freaks",

260
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:43,038
and you don't even realize
that someone close to you is one of them.

261
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:47,025
Why are you ignoring
what's right in front of your face, chloe?

262
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:50,056
Don't you want to know
the truth about clark kent?

263
00:21:51,237 --> 00:21:54,102
Everyone knows you're crazy.
Why should I believe you?

264
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:57,610
You don't have to.
I'm gonna prove it.

265
00:21:57,764 --> 00:22:00,472
And then you can write
the story of a lifetime.

266
00:22:04,426 --> 00:22:06,656
Where are we?
What are you doing?

267
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:11,348
Giving you your next headline...
and making things better for clark.

268
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:21,800
Clark, I'm on old blossom road, and there's something
really wrong with the car! It won't stop!

269
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:24,046
Just hurry!

270
00:22:25,352 --> 00:22:30,215
Once you see this, you'll understand.
And clark can be who he really is,

271
00:22:30,277 --> 00:22:35,150
and you can use that poison pen of yours
to enlighten smallville for a change.

272
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,058
- Clark, what are you..?
- Don't worry, chloe.

273
00:23:19,337 --> 00:23:21,214
Oh, my god.

274
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:33,807
Voilà, smallville... about 1988.

275
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:38,059
Before the meteor shower.
After that, everything changed.

276
00:23:38,105 --> 00:23:43,213
My father used to say that... that the meteor shower
infected smallville somehow. It brought an..

277
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:45,321
evil to our town.

278
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:47,874
Sounds like something
from the sci-fi channel.

279
00:23:47,921 --> 00:23:49,151
Yeah.

280
00:23:49,197 --> 00:23:53,351
I'm sorry, I get a little carried away
by the past sometimes.

281
00:23:54,044 --> 00:23:58,090
I don't have many memories
of my father, you know.

282
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,752
He passed away when I was young.

283
00:24:02,552 --> 00:24:04,660
I know what it's like to lose a parent.

284
00:24:04,706 --> 00:24:06,652
My mom died when I was little.

285
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:09,444
I cherish the memories I have of her.

286
00:24:10,037 --> 00:24:11,206
Yeah...

287
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:16,222
my favorites are when my father
used to talk about smallville

288
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:18,807
and the way things used to be.

289
00:24:19,314 --> 00:24:20,576
I mean...

290
00:24:20,652 --> 00:24:22,468
look at it now.

291
00:24:22,514 --> 00:24:26,576
Nobody... nobody cares
about right or wrong or...

292
00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:28,206
or morality.

293
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:31,390
Like that football coach dating a student.

294
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,052
It's not right.

295
00:24:33,175 --> 00:24:35,744
They're both over 18.

296
00:24:38,483 --> 00:24:42,406
Lois, it... it doesn't make it right.

297
00:24:42,668 --> 00:24:46,406
No. I mean, rules...
rules are there for a reason.

298
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,606
If those two got away with it,
then other people would try,

299
00:24:50,652 --> 00:24:52,098
you see?

300
00:24:52,268 --> 00:24:55,191
It's a good thing
that they were punished.

301
00:24:56,037 --> 00:25:00,480
So you think they were attacked because
someone thought their relationship was immoral?

302
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:06,126
I think that they got exactly
what they deserved.

303
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:13,535
Wow... just look at the time.

304
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:17,796
I've gotta get back to the torch.
I have some... studying to do.

305
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,749
Chloe, have you seen clark?

306
00:25:38,795 --> 00:25:41,302
What?
Have I seen clark do what?

307
00:25:41,441 --> 00:25:43,318
What? Uh...

308
00:25:43,379 --> 00:25:45,517
- yeah, I've seen him.
- Where?

309
00:25:45,563 --> 00:25:47,471
Why?
Something happen?

310
00:25:47,517 --> 00:25:51,467
Bad date. I'm starting to think maybe alicia
isn't our resident psycho killer.

311
00:25:51,528 --> 00:25:52,974
I need to find clark.

312
00:25:53,021 --> 00:25:55,574
He's probably zipping around,
looking for alicia.

313
00:25:56,313 --> 00:25:57,682
You all right?

314
00:25:57,821 --> 00:26:00,821
Fine. Yeah.
Fine. Uh...

315
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:04,990
he's probably out at alicia's house.

316
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:08,298
I'll swing by, see if he's there. Can you give me
a call if he shows up here? Okay.

317
00:26:08,344 --> 00:26:10,283
Okay.
Okay.

318
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:24,855
I'm glad you're finally home.

319
00:26:24,886 --> 00:26:26,440
What are you doing?

320
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:28,809
Oh, I'm...

321
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:32,948
I'm just looking for evidence
to leave at the next murder.

322
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:34,809
It was you.

323
00:26:35,255 --> 00:26:38,378
Everyone thinks that
I'm guilty because of you.

324
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,332
You are guilty. I mean, this...
this really used to be such a nice little town.

325
00:26:42,378 --> 00:26:44,625
You don't understand what you've done.

326
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:48,071
Even clark thinks that I'm guilty.
You're not getting to...

327
00:26:50,963 --> 00:26:52,348
I already have.

328
00:27:18,215 --> 00:27:21,046
You certainly have grown.

329
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:26,769
Forgive me, but... you'll have to
refresh my memory, Mrs. Teague.

330
00:27:26,953 --> 00:27:29,153
I wasn't aware that we'd met before.

331
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:31,784
No, please, Lex, call me Genevieve.

332
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:36,722
I served on numerous committees
with your father and your late mother.

333
00:27:36,768 --> 00:27:38,817
I used to see you with them often.

334
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:41,922
A bored young boy at the opera...

335
00:27:41,968 --> 00:27:44,014
always getting into trouble.

336
00:27:44,337 --> 00:27:47,291
Some of my finer moments, I'm sure.

337
00:27:47,352 --> 00:27:49,521
Can I get you something, Genevieve?

338
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:52,937
I assure you, my tastes have matured.

339
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,234
I'm sure you've developed a taste
for quite a lot of things, Lex.

340
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:06,926
I understand you have
a relationship with lana lang.

341
00:28:08,511 --> 00:28:11,064
Care to tell me where this is going?

342
00:28:13,034 --> 00:28:18,571
My son is young, Lex. Young and headstrong...
like that boy at the opera.

343
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:21,694
He can't always see what's best for him.

344
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,602
And you can.

345
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:26,901
With the wisdom of age, yes, I can.

346
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:29,640
And what I see is that he's

347
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:32,932
throwing his future away,
as is your friend.

348
00:28:36,343 --> 00:28:40,604
Surely you know they're in a relationship
that will never work.

349
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:46,497
I don't usually involve myself in other
people's affairs of the heart, Genevieve.

350
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,850
But you did intervene at the high school.

351
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:51,204
That was a civic matter.

352
00:28:51,942 --> 00:28:56,958
Look, I'm not a family therapist,
but I would suggest that you talk to your son.

353
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:01,943
Oh, I've tried, lex.

354
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:05,528
But as is often the way with young men,

355
00:29:05,574 --> 00:29:08,389
they don't listen particularly to their mothers.

356
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:13,476
I was hoping I could
persuade you to help me.

357
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,522
As I said, I don't interfere...

358
00:29:18,553 --> 00:29:21,969
...in other people's affairs
of the heart, I know.

359
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:25,692
Perhaps you should look
at the bigger picture, Lex.

360
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:29,108
Helping me could work
to your advantage.

361
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:32,185
I recently came across
some information

362
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:36,929
about how your father managed to overturn
his conviction and get out of prison.

363
00:29:37,991 --> 00:29:40,360
Information you might find...

364
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,637
very interesting.

365
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:15,910
Alicia!

366
00:30:27,837 --> 00:30:28,807
Alicia.

367
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,129
No. Please, no.

368
00:30:40,283 --> 00:30:42,222
Please, Alicia.

369
00:30:42,268 --> 00:30:44,114
No... no.

370
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:47,560
No!

371
00:30:48,129 --> 00:30:49,053
No!

372
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:55,468
No!

373
00:30:57,761 --> 00:30:58,822
Clark!

374
00:31:00,022 --> 00:31:01,745
Oh, my god.

375
00:31:02,145 --> 00:31:04,391
Clark, what happened?

376
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,011
I think I know who did this...

377
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,526
and where we can find him.

378
00:31:31,254 --> 00:31:34,392
even you thought she was guilty,
didn't you? Huh?

379
00:31:39,885 --> 00:31:45,392
Try not to feel too bad. I mean, hey,
she did try to kill your girlfriend last year.

380
00:31:47,854 --> 00:31:50,285
You tried to kill lana.
What does that make you?

381
00:31:50,331 --> 00:31:54,984
No, try to understand, Clark.
I did what's right for Smallville.

382
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,792
I have to make things right.

383
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,955
You killed alicia.

384
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,678
I loved her, and you took
that away from me.

385
00:32:24,505 --> 00:32:26,259
You killed her!

386
00:32:26,705 --> 00:32:29,136
All she wanted was a chance.

387
00:32:29,182 --> 00:32:31,198
- You killed her!
- Clark! Stop!

388
00:32:31,244 --> 00:32:33,951
Stop! Clark!

389
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:40,398
Let him go!

390
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,401
It's gonna be okay.

391
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,155
Clark, it's gonna be okay.

392
00:33:07,135 --> 00:33:09,582
Now, why would lex luthor
want to see me?

393
00:33:09,692 --> 00:33:11,292
Let me take a stab at it.

394
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:17,661
'Cause you want to lecture me on the evils of a part-time coach
dating an 18-year-old high school student.

395
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:21,032
I took a hard line about
the school rules, Jason, but...

396
00:33:21,078 --> 00:33:24,401
that doesn't mean I don't appreciate
the individuals involved.

397
00:33:24,447 --> 00:33:26,878
I'm sorry I cost you a job.

398
00:33:26,955 --> 00:33:28,970
And I'd like to make it up to you.

399
00:33:31,212 --> 00:33:32,488
Really.

400
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:37,735
I mean, you still haven't rescheduled my meeting
with your H.R. guy over at luthorcorp.

401
00:33:37,781 --> 00:33:41,012
I have a position you might
find more appealing.

402
00:33:41,704 --> 00:33:45,231
A position that pays $100,000 a year.

403
00:33:46,616 --> 00:33:50,770
Because I'm obviously qualified
for a $100,000-a-year job.

404
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:52,789
My mother put you up to this,
didn't she?

405
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:55,066
She is trying her best
to get between lana and me.

406
00:33:55,096 --> 00:33:57,819
She's trying to do
a lot more than that, Jason.

407
00:33:58,342 --> 00:34:00,789
That's why I want to work together...

408
00:34:00,973 --> 00:34:03,450
to find out what she's really up to.

409
00:34:03,931 --> 00:34:05,977
You want to team up
against my mother?

410
00:34:06,024 --> 00:34:08,085
The enemy of my enemy.

411
00:34:09,824 --> 00:34:12,285
And how do I know I can trust you?

412
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:14,439
You don't.

413
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,809
But what other choice do you have?

414
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:40,779
Clark...

415
00:34:42,702 --> 00:34:45,805
honey, you've been up here for two days.

416
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,789
What happened to alicia...

417
00:34:57,143 --> 00:34:59,204
wasn't your fault.

418
00:35:01,343 --> 00:35:03,974
If I had believed her,
she wouldn't be dead.

419
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:05,135
Clark,

420
00:35:05,182 --> 00:35:07,674
she was framed. There'S...

421
00:35:08,797 --> 00:35:11,458
there's no way
you could've known that.

422
00:35:13,274 --> 00:35:15,136
I could've trusted her.

423
00:35:15,182 --> 00:35:19,705
Did you know that alicia wanted me to go
to the sheriff with her and tell her everything?

424
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:24,874
Alicia thought that if people knew
the truth about me and what I can do,

425
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,520
they wouldn't be so quick to judge her.

426
00:35:29,182 --> 00:35:31,162
But I didn't go.

427
00:35:32,408 --> 00:35:35,747
I was too afraid of
what people might think,

428
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:37,639
how they would react.

429
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,547
What if she was right?

430
00:35:39,593 --> 00:35:41,639
Because if people knew

431
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,764
what I can do and who I really am...

432
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:50,272
maybe she'd still be alive.

433
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:58,280
And I just can't
forgive myself for that.

434
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,220
I'm headed back to school.
I have an 8:00 class tomorrow.

435
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,343
Okay.

436
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:29,989
Looking for clues about Tim's ability,

437
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,958
things we should have
seen before, blaming alicia?

438
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,943
I think maybe
I've seen too much already.

439
00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:37,620
I've spent the last four years
ferreting out meteor freaks, trying to

440
00:36:37,682 --> 00:36:39,528
expose them.

441
00:36:39,943 --> 00:36:42,251
I never should've started this wall.

442
00:36:43,989 --> 00:36:46,579
Chloe, you're a reporter.

443
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:49,441
You investigate and expose.
That's who you are.

444
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:52,195
Yeah, well, I guess
sometimes it sucks being me.

445
00:36:57,439 --> 00:36:58,608
Lois, if...

446
00:36:58,654 --> 00:37:00,870
if you found out something...

447
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:05,593
something someone didn't want you to know
about them... would you tell them?

448
00:37:06,597 --> 00:37:10,382
That depends. Is that person
someone you care about?

449
00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:13,320
Yeah.

450
00:37:13,474 --> 00:37:16,332
And has keeping
the secret hurt anyone?

451
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:19,886
No.

452
00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:22,394
Then my answer is no.

453
00:37:22,424 --> 00:37:26,316
If I really cared about that person,
I wouldn't tell them that I knew.

454
00:37:26,393 --> 00:37:30,316
But I would go out of my way to be
supportive of them so that hopefully,

455
00:37:30,362 --> 00:37:33,985
one day, they would be comfortable
enough to tell me themselves.

456
00:37:35,348 --> 00:37:39,133
No offense, lois, but that's the last thing
I expected to hear from you.

457
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:44,050
I've learned the hard way
that people keep secrets for a reason,

458
00:37:44,173 --> 00:37:46,665
even from the people
they're closest to.

459
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:52,270
Chloe, is there something
you want to tell me?

460
00:37:54,793 --> 00:37:56,901
Are you the one with the secret?

461
00:37:56,947 --> 00:37:58,393
No.

462
00:37:59,032 --> 00:38:00,740
No, it's not me.

463
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:02,524
Okay.

464
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:06,416
I'll see you in a couple
of weeks or so.

465
00:38:06,663 --> 00:38:07,724
Yeah.

466
00:38:11,182 --> 00:38:14,120
I'm sure whoever it is
that you're talking about

467
00:38:14,243 --> 00:38:16,474
will tell you when they're ready.

468
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,151
Thanks.

469
00:38:19,628 --> 00:38:20,659
Bye baby.

470
00:38:20,861 --> 00:38:21,938
Bye.

471
00:38:22,353 --> 00:38:24,415
- Safe drive home.
- Okay.

472
00:38:39,424 --> 00:38:40,885
Clark...

473
00:38:41,793 --> 00:38:43,161
why don't you just tell me?

474
00:38:59,953 --> 00:39:02,704
Local teen discovers indian caves.

475
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,144
Hey, Clark.

476
00:39:34,113 --> 00:39:37,329
I... just wanted to say
that I am so sorry.

477
00:39:37,852 --> 00:39:39,883
For everything.

478
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,609
It must've been so hard

479
00:39:49,132 --> 00:39:51,194
being so different,

480
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:56,278
having everyone judge you
before they even know you.

481
00:39:57,841 --> 00:40:01,518
Knowing that there's some people that...
might never accept you.

482
00:40:09,136 --> 00:40:10,336
I just...

483
00:40:11,228 --> 00:40:14,351
I want you to know
that I'm here for you...

484
00:40:15,674 --> 00:40:17,874
if you ever need to talk.

485
00:40:23,117 --> 00:40:26,425
Thanks, chloe.
I appreciate that.

486
