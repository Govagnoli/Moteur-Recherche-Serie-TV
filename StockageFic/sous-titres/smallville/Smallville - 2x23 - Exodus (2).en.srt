1
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,320
Fear not, Kal-EI.

2
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,080
- Who are you?
- I am Jor-EI, your father.

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,880
- I thought you died.
- I am his memory.

4
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,760
His will.

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,800
I am to fulfill his promise
and guide you all the days of your life.

6
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,800
You are the last son of Krypton.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When you traveled through the cosmos,
you carried the hopes and dreams...

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,160
...of your people.
They now live through you, Kal-EI.

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,920
It is time.

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,360
Time for what?

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,920
Time to accept your destiny.

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,440
I don't know what you have
in mind for me, but l...

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,600
By the setting of the sun Sol...

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,480
...you will return to me.

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,120
Your destiny will be fulfilled.

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,080
Your thoughts are not
a mystery to me, Kal-EI.

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,280
But these people have served
their purpose.

18
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,200
It is time to leave them.

19
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,960
Please...

20
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,960
...everything and everyone
I love is here in Smallville.

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,720
You must let go of your past.

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,720
I will guide you to your future.

23
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,080
No, I don't want your guidance.

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,040
- I want to create my own future.
- You have no choice, Kal-EI.

25
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,920
Well, you're up early.

26
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,120
Never went to sleep.

27
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,840
Clark, what's wrong?

28
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,000
I kind of met my biological father
last night.

29
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,240
When I heard his voice,
it was coming from the ship.

30
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,280
But it sounded like
it was from my own head.

31
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,040
He said it was time.

32
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,520
- He said it was time for what?
- To leave Smallville and fulfill my destiny.

33
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,840
He said that?

34
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,360
- I have until sundown today.
- Or what?

35
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,960
I'm not sure.

36
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,640
But he said I didn't have a choice.

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,560
Why is it happening now
when my life is coming together?

38
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,640
The farm's out of debt,
I'm gonna be a big brother.

39
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,680
Lana and I are finally getting together.

40
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,520
Whatever your biological father
may have had in mind for you...

41
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,720
...they're his hopes and dreams,
not yours.

42
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,040
Clark, you choose your own destiny.

43
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,320
Nobody can decide that for you, son.

44
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,440
This is my home...

45
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,760
...and you're my parents.

46
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,600
It's where I belong,
and I'm not going anywhere.

47
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,560
Haven't seen you two together since...

48
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,800
Well, Dad, since you tried to bribe
Helen into dumping me.

49
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,440
And now Dr. Bryce refuses to accept this,
my wedding gift to her.

50
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,640
If you two star-crossed lovers
will excuse me.

51
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,920
You want to tell me
what that was all about?

52
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,480
Exactly what your father said.

53
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,680
You know what, I'm tired of being
a pawn in this never-ending struggle.

54
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,760
We both said some things last night.

55
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,520
I don't want to go into this marriage
with any secrets between us.

56
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,200
I haven't held anything back, Lex.

57
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,320
I have. Look inside.

58
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,200
I did break into your office.
And that's what I was after.

59
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,320
I told you because
I'm trying to break the cycle.

60
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,160
I don't want to be the person
who did this anymore.

61
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,560
But you did do it, Lex.

62
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,560
You committed a crime.

63
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,120
You violated my privacy
and that of my patient.

64
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,120
- I know.
- What did you think would happen?

65
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,640
That you'd give it back,
tell me what you did...

66
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,600
...and I'd just forgive you
and we'd live happily ever after?

67
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,440
I don't know what I expected.

68
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,240
All I know is that I love you.

69
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,040
I'm sure in some part
of that twisted mind, you do.

70
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,000
I didn't have it analyzed.

71
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,240
What was so important
about this blood, anyway?

72
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,400
I thought it would give me
the answers I've been looking for.

73
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,560
All it did was end this relationship.

74
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,280
You okay?

75
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,960
Yeah, I'm great.

76
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,400
You know...

77
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,240
...I can always tell
when you're being less than truthful.

78
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,160
It's just, I've...

79
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,720
I've waited for this for so long.

80
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,600
For us.

81
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,120
I just don't want it to go away.

82
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,920
I'm not going anywhere.

83
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,480
Neither am I.

84
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,680
So, Lana, does this mean you're
officially my date to Lex's wedding?

85
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,320
Only after we officially tell Chloe
about our change in status.

86
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,080
Clark, I've been avoiding her all day.

87
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,720
All right, just let me tell her.

88
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,360
Chloe and I agreed that we'd
be upfront about things like this.

89
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,320
Well, I'm sure if we're honest,
she'll be fine.

90
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,840
Never realized the small-town press
could be so pithy.

91
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,160
What do you think your father's up to?

92
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,320
He's already got a team
working overtime...

93
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,360
...installing some pretty sophisticated
machinery down there.

94
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,400
What for?

95
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,280
I wish I could tell you, but I'm the last
person he'd ever let back in those caves.

96
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,200
He's tightened security.

97
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,360
I doubt even you'll be able to sneak past.

98
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,160
Where's this tailor?

99
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,680
Kind of pressed for time today.

100
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,760
I canceled him.

101
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,960
Why?

102
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,320
Because Helen's not walking
down the aisle tomorrow.

103
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,040
I saw her last night.
She seemed really happy.

104
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,760
- A lot can change in 24 hours.
- Why'd she break it off?

105
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,560
I've always been fighting my destiny.

106
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,120
Trying to avoid becoming my father.

107
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,120
But we all have certain genes that...

108
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,160
...no matter how much we want
to change, dominate us.

109
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,200
What'd you do?

110
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,080
I betrayed Helen's trust.

111
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,520
Then I fought my own nature
and did something very un-Luthor-like.

112
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,560
I confessed my sin,
hoping she'd forgive me.

113
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,680
My guess is she didn't.

114
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,720
Don't tell anyone, Clark.

115
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,440
I want to hold on to my romantic notions
for one more day.

116
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm gonna have to put a stop
to these unauthorized visits.

117
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,160
Mr. Luthor.

118
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,600
What are you doing here?

119
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,080
I was just curious.

120
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,640
I'd suppose so.

121
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,600
According to poor Dr. Walden, you're
talked about quite a bit on these walls.

122
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,680
Apparently, you are going to rule us all.

123
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,880
I'm surprised someone like you would
put stock in anything he had to say.

124
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,160
I know you worked closely
with the man, Clark.

125
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,920
I'm sure there are insights you could
give me. It would be extremely helpful.

126
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,720
He didn't tell me anything.

127
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,400
What's with all the machinery?

128
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm going to unlock the secrets
hidden in these walls.

129
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,880
Didn't you see what happened
to Dr. Walden? It's dangerous.

130
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,040
Yes, but I have something he didn't:

131
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,960
The key.

132
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,840
Once I insert that key into the slot...

133
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,760
...I'm convinced the answers
will be revealed to me.

134
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,680
I thought your key
was stolen from your vault.

135
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,000
It was. But before it mysteriously
disappeared, I had it analyzed.

136
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,320
The composition was...

137
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,840
...unique.

138
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,720
There's nothing like it on Earth.
With one exception:

139
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,760
The meteor rocks found here
in Smallville.

140
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,600
So I have fashioned my own key.

141
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,960
It's identical in every detail.

142
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,120
Isn't it beautiful? Look.

143
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,080
Clark, you don't look well.
Are you all right?

144
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,400
I'm fine.

145
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,160
Just...

146
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,240
...be careful.

147
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,600
Lionel Luthor's never gotten
anywhere in life by playing it safe.

148
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,400
- I'm sure you'll render Clark speechless.
- Chloe, hi.

149
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,760
Be careful you two don't upstage
the bride and groom.

150
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,240
- What do you mean?
- You two are going together, I assume.

151
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,760
Yeah. Yeah, as friends.

152
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,840
Right. Friends.

153
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,360
Have you seen Clark?
He's been looking for you.

154
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,720
No. I've been trying to track
him down all day...

155
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,200
...but his parents said that he was
mired in best-man duties.

156
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,360
When did you see him last?

157
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,840
Oh, I ran into him at the Talon.

158
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,120
He wanted to talk to you,
said it was important.

159
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,520
Well, I guess it couldn't be as important
as you thought.

160
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,800
Have fun tomorrow.

161
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,200
I figured this is where I'd find you.

162
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,680
Just watching the sunset.

163
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,720
Hope it's not the last one
I see from up here.

164
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,560
It won't be, Clark.

165
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,080
Son, it's just another sundown.

166
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,760
Come on, your mother's got dinner ready.

167
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,240
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

168
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,560
Dad?

169
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,360
Yeah.

170
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,080
Thanks for always believing in me.

171
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,440
You're welcome, son.

172
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,240
It is time, Kal-EI. Come to me.

173
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,840
You will obey me, Kal-EI.

174
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,440
You're not my father.
I won't let you control me.

175
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,280
This is the mark of your ancestors.
You cannot fight it, Kal-EI.

176
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,160
At the zenith of the star Sol,
you will begin your journey.

177
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,760
If you do not, you will hurt
the ones you love most.

178
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,360
Clark, why aren't you ready?

179
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,320
The wedding doesn't start for
a few hours.

180
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,480
- Your mother wants to get a good seat.
- I promised I'd go early...

181
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,200
...and check the flowers.

182
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,560
I gotta pick up Lana,
so I'll meet you there.

183
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,240
We obviously have to get used to the fact
that you have a girlfriend now.

184
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,200
Clark...

185
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,160
How's it going today, son?

186
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,000
Good.

187
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,000
- No voice?
- No voice.

188
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,760
Looks like you'll have to face the future
the old-fashioned way.

189
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,400
I guess so. It's pretty scary.

190
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,480
Heck, yeah.

191
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,160
- Mom.
- Yes?

192
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,120
You look beautiful today.

193
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,280
Thank you, sweetheart.

194
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,480
Helen.

195
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,560
- You're here.
- I am so angry at you.

196
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,160
- What you did was unforgivable.
- You're right.

197
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,880
But the farther I got
from you and this town...

198
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:59,080
...I realized that, while any sane person
would have kept driving...

199
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,800
...I needed to turn around.

200
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,600
I started to look at myself and mistakes
that I've made in my life.

201
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,720
I hope I'm not one of them.

202
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,360
No, Lex, you're not.

203
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,120
That's the thing.

204
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,160
I still love you.

205
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,320
Oh, man.

206
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,320
- Does it hurt?
- No, not now.

207
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,480
You got any idea what it means?

208
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,200
It's my biological father's way
of telling me I have to do what he wants.

209
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,680
I'm afraid by noon it'll control me.

210
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,680
Your parents must be freaked out.

211
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,120
I didn't tell them.

212
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,600
Why wouldn't you tell them, Clark?

213
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,640
Because, Pete,
I know what I have to do...

214
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,840
...and they'll never agree with me
in a million years.

215
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,440
I have to destroy the ship.

216
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,960
What?

217
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,840
Clark, no.

218
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,400
This traveled millions of miles through
space. I don't think we can even dent it.

219
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,480
What if we had a kryptonite key?

220
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,200
Clark, this is whacked.

221
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,520
Pete, remember Lana's necklace?

222
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,800
What's it have to do
with destroying the ship?

223
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,560
Everything, Pete. When Tina Greer
tied me up down here, it nearly killed me.

224
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,480
But before it could,
the ship neutralized it.

225
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,160
- You said the ship was protecting you.
- What if it's actually protecting itself?

226
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,920
Think about it, Pete.

227
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,760
I'm from Krypton and so is this ship, and
what's the one thing that can kill me?

228
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,280
So you're thinking that kryptonite
can destroy the ship?

229
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,600
Clark, it's too dangerous.

230
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,960
Do you hear me? You've never done this
before. You don't know what'll happen.

231
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,400
It could kill you.

232
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,800
Besides, where are we gonna get
a kryptonite key?

233
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,000
How much longer now?

234
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,360
- Another 10 minutes, sir.
- Another 10 minutes.

235
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,960
Hey, Luthor!
I've got something to say to you.

236
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,760
Security.

237
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,600
- Get him out of here.
- Don't put your hands on me. Get off me.

238
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,720
If they don't let me go, I'll lay a lawsuit
on you so fast your head will spin.

239
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,920
All right, all right, I'll talk to him.
Do I know you?

240
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,760
- The name's Pete Ross.
- Ross, Ross, Ross...

241
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,160
As in Ross Creamed Corn?
You stole my family's business.

242
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,360
- I overpaid for that ramshackle factory.
- Nobody in this town likes you.

243
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,160
- Don't touch me. You hate him.
- I know that.

244
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,880
But I value their hatred.
I find it very useful.

245
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,040
You see, people are always
at their weakest when they're angry.

246
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,400
Ask your father.

247
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,120
I'll do that.

248
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,760
Get him out.

249
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,640
No.

250
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,680
No.

251
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,520
No!

252
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,440
You.

253
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,200
Search him. Search him.

254
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,640
- Search me? What are you doing?
- Where is it?

255
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,640
Where's what?

256
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,560
Careful, Mr. Luthor.

257
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,880
Wouldn't want to look weak.

258
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,800
Lex.

259
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,000
Mr. And Mrs. Kent.

260
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,160
Where's the best man?

261
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,400
Well, Clark and punctuality have never
been on the best terms, but he'll be here.

262
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,120
I got you something.

263
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,720
- A compass.
- Yeah, it's a Kent family tradition.

264
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,360
My father gave me one at our wedding,
in case I got lost going down the aisle.

265
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,280
Thank you, Mr. Kent.

266
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,920
Why aren't you dressed?

267
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,960
- There's something I have to do first.
- What?

268
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,000
I can't tell you.

269
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,960
Just know it's for us and our future.

270
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,120
Last time a guy said that to me...

271
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,920
...he went off to war.

272
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,280
You should go.

273
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,720
I'll meet you there.

274
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,240
You sure you're all right?

275
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,680
Yeah.

276
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,240
Go.

277
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,720
Okay.

278
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,640
- Lana, l...
- Yeah?

279
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,160
I just wanted to remember this moment.

280
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,640
Any word on Clark? Helen's already
circled the church five times.

281
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,200
He was coming with Lana.

282
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,560
Lana, where's Clark?

283
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,560
He said he had something to do.
It seemed important.

284
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,720
- Mr. Kent...
- I'm sorry, Lex.

285
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,880
You'll have to start
without your best man.

286
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,920
- We can wait.
- Hey, don't worry about Clark.

287
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,920
You've got far more important
things to do here. Good luck.

288
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,280
Hey, Clark.

289
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,400
I'm glad I caught you
before the wedding.

290
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,760
- Chloe, what are you doing here?
- I heard you were looking for me.

291
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,840
Yeah, I was.

292
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,880
I can't talk to you right now.

293
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,960
- What are you doing?
- I'll find you later.

294
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,360
- Clark, I couldn't...
- Don't worry. I'll find you, okay?

295
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,560
So how'd you decide?

296
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,560
Rock, Paper, Scissors? Coin toss?
Or did you just draw the short straw?

297
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Decide...?

298
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,840
Who was gonna tell me
that you and Lana are together.

299
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,280
You know?

300
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,280
Yeah. I came over to the barn the other
night to warn you about something.

301
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,640
- About what?
- You know, it doesn't matter now.

302
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,480
The point is,
I saw you and Lana in a major lip-Iock.

303
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,280
- I didn't mean...
- Didn't what, Clark?

304
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,280
News flash! You've always
been in love with Lana.

305
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,320
I tried to deny it, thinking that maybe
we could work something out, but...

306
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,640
It's like fate, Clark.

307
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,560
Inevitable, but always surprising
when it actually happens.

308
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,440
- I was gonna tell you.
- Really?

309
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,280
Obviously it was on
the top of your to-do list.

310
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,680
I can deal with the fact you guys are
together. It hurts, but I was prepared.

311
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,160
But we just made a promise
to be honest with each other...

312
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,160
...and you didn't have the guts
to keep your word.

313
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,400
Or was it too much fun making a fool of
me that you couldn't reveal your secret?

314
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,040
Have a nice life, Clark.

315
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,960
Mr. And Mrs. Luthor, welcome aboard.

316
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,000
It'll be a couple of minutes.
The tower's generator just kicked in.

317
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,480
The county suffered
some sort of power failure.

318
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,360
Good. It'll mask our getaway.

319
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,200
To our new life.

320
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,160
What's the matter?

321
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,080
Nothing.

322
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,880
Everything's perfect.

323
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,520
- How is she?
- Doctors don't know yet.

324
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,120
What did you do, Clark?

325
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,200
I stole Lionel's kryptonite key.

326
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,600
I put it in the ship.

327
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,720
Why did you do that?

328
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,920
Dad, I lied about the voice.

329
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,040
It did come back.
It told me I had to leave by noon.

330
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,480
I didn't have a choice, Dad.

331
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,600
- I had to destroy the ship.
- Why didn't you tell us?

332
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,280
I knew you wouldn't agree
with what I did.

333
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,560
Dad, I didn't want it to take me
away from you.

334
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,160
- I'm so sorry for what I did.
- Your actions have consequences, Clark.

335
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,160
- Didn't your mother and I teach you that?
- Yes, but...

336
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,480
There's no time for excuses, Clark.

337
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,800
It's too late.

338
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,720
You didn't think this thing through.

339
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,240
You had no idea what was gonna
happen, and now...

340
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,240
Now your mother...

341
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,360
...is lying in a hospital bed.

342
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,600
Mr. Kent.

343
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,320
Doctor, how is my wife?

344
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,720
She has a mild concussion,
but she'll be fine.

345
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,600
And how is our baby?

346
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,640
I'm sorry.

347
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,920
Dad.

348
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,800
Clark, what happened?

349
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,360
It looks like a bomb went off.

350
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,800
Where are your parents?

351
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,200
Hospital.

352
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,960
They're fine.

353
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,960
My mom lost the baby.

354
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,200
The baby?

355
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,520
This is all my fault, Lana. I did this.

356
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,200
How could you do this?

357
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,080
The same way I always do.

358
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,200
Bring pain and suffering
to everyone's lives.

359
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,440
- Clark, that's not true.
- Yes, Lana, it is.

360
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,000
Lana, I've kept so much from you.

361
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,880
If you knew the truth,
you'd never talk to me again.

362
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,680
I don't believe that.

363
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,280
I tried to cover up my past
and push it away.

364
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,120
I couldn't.

365
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,160
He said if I didn't go,
everyone I love would be hurt.

366
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,880
He was right.

367
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,920
Clark, you're in shock.

368
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,400
- You're not making any...
- No, Lana, stay away from me.

369
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,560
Stay away from me
before I hurt you too.

370
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,120
I'm glad you finally decided
to accept my offer.

371
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,160
You know you have a very exciting
future ahead of you, Ms. Sullivan.

372
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,560
Well, opportunities like this aren't
dropped on your doorstep every day.

373
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,440
Why the sudden change of heart?

374
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,240
You were right about Clark.

375
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,640
He wasn't who I thought he was.

376
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,880
I'm surprised I hadn't noticed earlier.
So much for my journalistic instinct.

377
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,440
No. No, love has a way of blinding
even the sharpest minds.

378
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,800
We don't look because
we don't want to see.

379
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,120
But once love has been stripped away,
then we see the real person clearly.

380
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:10,680
They're revealed to us
with all their flaws, their foibles...

381
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,800
...and their secrets.

382
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,840
I've got a meeting.

383
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,640
- I'm sorry to rush you out like this.
- That's fine.

384
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,480
Mr. Luthor, why are you
so interested in Clark?

385
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,520
You don't expect me to show you
all my cards now, do you?

386
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,880
No, I guess not.

387
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,120
All will be revealed in good time,
Ms. Sullivan.

388
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,560
Thank you, Mr. Luthor.

389
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,000
I'm here, sweetheart. I'm here.

390
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,080
Clark, I've been looking all over for you,
I heard what happened.

391
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,360
You here to tell me I screwed up
in a major way?

392
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,320
No, I'm here to say I'm sorry
and I want to help.

393
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,360
It's too late for that, Pete.
No one can help me now.

394
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,560
Clark, what are you looking for?

395
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,240
I know Chloe kept one of those
red kryptonite rings here.

396
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,280
Why do you want it?
You know what it does.

397
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,440
Yeah, it makes me feel better.

398
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,360
That's not the answer, Clark.

399
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,240
I saw Lana. I heard what happened
to your mom's baby.

400
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,640
- Clark, you need to talk to your folks.
- I did talk to my parents, Pete.

401
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,360
You should've seen the way my dad
looked at me. It was like I was an alien.

402
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,920
If I'd done what I should've,
none of this would've happened.

403
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,480
Clark, don't do it. When you put
that ring on, you're not yourself.

404
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,920
Exactly who I don't
want to be right now, Pete.

405
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,560
Clark!

406
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,400
Clark, where are you going?

407
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,520
Away from here.

408
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,520
The Clark Kent I know wouldn't
run away from his problems.

409
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,480
The Clark Kent you know is a lie.

410
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,120
- Why won't you let me in?
- Because you won't like what you see.

411
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,800
- I am not giving up on you.
- No one can save me.

412
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,640
- Not even you.
- Your parents need you. I need you.

413
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,160
I love you, Clark.

414
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,760
I love you too.

415
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,680
More than you'll ever know.

416
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,400
That's why I have to leave.

417
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,120
Come with me.

418
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,520
Smallville's my home.
It's your home too.

419
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,760
Not anymore.

420
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,480
Helen.

421
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,480
Helen?

422
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,800
You will obey me, Kal-EI.
