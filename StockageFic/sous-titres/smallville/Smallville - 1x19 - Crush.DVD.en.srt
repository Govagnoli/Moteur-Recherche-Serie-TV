1
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,577
Justin.

2
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:27,844
I just thought I'd stop by
and say goodbye.

3
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:31,753
I heard you were going
back to Smallville tomorrow.

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,290
Yeah, Smallville.

5
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:37,963
How's it going?

6
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:48,741
You tell me.

7
00:00:50,277 --> 00:00:53,576
You've been here five months.
You've come a long way.

8
00:00:53,748 --> 00:00:55,841
Your body has done a lot of healing.

9
00:00:56,384 --> 00:00:59,046
Except for my hands.

10
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:03,289
They'll never get better
and I'll never draw again...

11
00:01:03,457 --> 00:01:06,517
...and that's the only thing
I was ever good at.

12
00:01:06,694 --> 00:01:11,529
You suffer severe nerve damage. It's
lucky you have movement in your hands.

13
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:14,463
-I did everything I could, you know that.
-Really?

14
00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:19,299
Is that what you told the five patients
who filed malpractice suits against you?

15
00:01:19,473 --> 00:01:22,567
Now, I can understand
your still being angry...

16
00:01:22,743 --> 00:01:25,177
...but blaming me isn't
gonna change your condition.

17
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:28,543
You were in an accident
and you have to accept that.

18
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:30,877
I was in a hit-and-run.

19
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:36,346
You know, when I was your age,
I wanted to be a violinist.

20
00:01:36,524 --> 00:01:40,858
So I applied to the Conservatory,
but I failed the audition.

21
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:44,691
The instructor told me
that I had the hands of a surgeon...

22
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,859
...and that's why I moved into medicine.

23
00:01:48,035 --> 00:01:50,265
As one door closes...

24
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:53,271
...another one opens.

25
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:57,108
You're young,
you'll find something new.

26
00:01:58,646 --> 00:02:01,012
Goodbye, Justin.

27
00:02:05,453 --> 00:02:07,751
Have a nice life, Dr. Wells.

28
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:13,350
Rene, honey, I'm sorry.

29
00:02:13,527 --> 00:02:16,826
-Another ungrateful patient?
-Aren't they all?

30
00:02:16,997 --> 00:02:20,990
-So you think he'll sue?
-He doesn't have any proof.

31
00:02:21,168 --> 00:02:25,104
He's alive, he should be thanking me.

32
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:37,477
What's going on?

33
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,694
You okay?

34
00:02:54,668 --> 00:02:58,001
Get us out of here! Hurry up! Come on!

35
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:03,474
Get us out of here now. Get us
out of here now! Hurry up! Come on!

36
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:08,310
-Help!
-Help us!

37
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:11,945
That's it.

38
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:15,054
-Give me a hand up.
-All right.

39
00:03:37,711 --> 00:03:40,077
Okay, grab my hands.

40
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,058
I see you in a uniform flying.

41
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:08,929
Have you ever considered
a career in the Air Force?

42
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:11,469
I'll think about it.

43
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:16,942
What are you smiling about?

44
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:20,603
I landed a summer job at Mayor Siegel's
working on his re-election campaign.

45
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:23,011
I thought you were helping
your mom at the court.

46
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:26,710
Judge Ross can get some KSU
students to schlep her files.

47
00:05:26,887 --> 00:05:29,447
Who wants to hang out with
their parents all summer?

48
00:05:29,623 --> 00:05:31,614
-Yeah.
-Sorry, Clark.

49
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:34,886
Did you notice Kwan's son
down at the Air Force booth?

50
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:38,930
Growing up with Kwan,
the Air Force would seem like Club Med.

51
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:42,532
-Wow, you look nice.
-Thanks, I was going for professional.

52
00:05:42,703 --> 00:05:46,605
<i>Did you know the Daily Planet only takes
four high school interns from the state?</i>

53
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:48,765
-You're a shoo-in, Chloe.
-Tell him that.

54
00:05:48,942 --> 00:05:51,934
He said they received
over 500 applicants last year.

55
00:05:52,112 --> 00:05:55,013
<i>-I doubt I'll get an interview.
-There's always the Inquisitor.</i>

56
00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:58,083
<i>-Didn't Lex offer to hook you up?
-I'm interning at the Planet.</i>

57
00:05:58,252 --> 00:06:00,550
I don't care if it's delivering coffee.

58
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:03,554
Why don't you try again Saturday
when you're in Metropolis?

59
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:06,420
Why are you going to Metropolis?

60
00:06:08,295 --> 00:06:10,593
We're going to Metropolis, Clark.

61
00:06:10,764 --> 00:06:13,528
The student journalism conference?

62
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:17,831
You were supposed to sign us up. I know
you didn't forget. It's too late to get in.

63
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:22,499
Sorry. I've been at the Talon all week
with Lana working on a history project.

64
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:26,134
-Everything else becomes less important.
-Whoa, that's not true.

65
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:30,276
How much time have we spent
together in three weeks?

66
00:06:30,451 --> 00:06:33,716
-We see each other every day.
-It was 45 minutes. My car broke down...

67
00:06:33,887 --> 00:06:36,117
...outside the Talon
and you gave me a ride home.

68
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,919
-I had to tear you away from Lana.
-Don't you think you're being unfair?

69
00:06:40,094 --> 00:06:42,892
No! Whenever Lex and Lana are around,
no one else exists.

70
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,631
Wait, Chloe, why are you being
so hypersensitive?

71
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,329
Most men are from Mars, but you're from
a distant galaxy I've never heard of.

72
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:56,335
I know I screwed up, but why is
Chloe having a breakdown?

73
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,968
-You're not the most observant person.
-What are you talking about?

74
00:07:00,147 --> 00:07:05,278
She wanted to spend a day with you. She
was gonna ask you to the spring formal.

75
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:07,283
Yeah, but that'd be like....

76
00:07:07,454 --> 00:07:09,445
Date?

77
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,222
Maybe if you took off your Lana
blinders, you'd realize Chloe likes you.

78
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:24,394
Clark, I'm not interested in an apology.

79
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:27,802
-Not the welcome I was expecting, hi.
-Hey!

80
00:07:27,975 --> 00:07:30,569
How are you? It's good to see you.
When did you get back?

81
00:07:30,744 --> 00:07:35,181
Yesterday. I just wanted to thank you,
by the way, for sending all those emails.

82
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:39,945
-They got me through a tough time.
-I'm sure lots of people kept in touch.

83
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,385
For most of my friends,
it was out of sight, out of mind.

84
00:07:43,557 --> 00:07:46,890
I know the feeling. So when can you
start drawing your cartoon again?

85
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,463
Everybody's been waiting for the further
adventures of the flaming crow's feet.

86
00:07:55,836 --> 00:07:58,134
Unfortunately my drawing
hand's kind of shot.

87
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:01,998
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

88
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:05,968
I'm in the process
of re-evaluating my life.

89
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:12,381
So listen, is there any chance that
maybe I could buy you a cup of coffee...

90
00:08:12,553 --> 00:08:16,045
...or one of those nonfat,
no-foam lattes that you like?

91
00:08:20,227 --> 00:08:24,891
Yeah, why not? I'm in the process
of re-evaluating my life too.

92
00:08:29,436 --> 00:08:30,801
Let's go.

93
00:08:57,364 --> 00:08:59,355
What are you doing here?

94
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:05,095
I'm here for the same reason you are.

95
00:09:06,073 --> 00:09:10,703
-The anniversary of her death.
-It's been nine years.

96
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:13,339
Why the sudden burst of sentimentality?

97
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,342
I deserve that, just disappearing
from your life.

98
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:19,611
I'm sure all that LuthorCorp stock
my mother left you helped.

99
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:22,414
Is that what your father told you?

100
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:26,621
All those years I thought you loved me.

101
00:09:28,362 --> 00:09:30,694
But you were just in it for the money.

102
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:37,596
I know you're angry and you have
every right to be, but we need to talk.

103
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,903
I can't believe there's anything
you'd say that would interest me.

104
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,770
Goodbye, Pamela.

105
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:58,047
This one's my favorite strip.

106
00:09:58,225 --> 00:09:59,783
-Really.
-Yes.

107
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,359
Hey, guys.

108
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:03,257
-Hey.
-You know Justin.

109
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,729
Yeah. Of course, welcome back.
How are you feeling?

110
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,961
Oh, just kind of taking it
one day at a time.

111
00:10:11,772 --> 00:10:13,603
Did they find the driver who hit you?

112
00:10:13,774 --> 00:10:17,835
No. No, I couldn't give the police much. I
didn't remember anything for a long time.

113
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:20,338
Well, what do you remember?

114
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:24,677
-A little bit of the license plate. DDI.
-Well, we should look into it.

115
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:27,752
-Call the police.
-lf we find something, we'll pass it on.

116
00:10:31,658 --> 00:10:33,216
Okay.

117
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:38,527
Anyway, I talked to Lex. He scored us
two tickets to the conference.

118
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:42,096
Don't worry about it. Justin's
signed up so I'm going as his guest.

119
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:44,860
-Yeah, or we could all go together.
-No.

120
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:48,908
Clark's not that interested
in journalism anyway.

121
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:54,975
Right, okay. I should probably
get going, listen--

122
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:09,157
Thank you.

123
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:19,699
-Hi.
-Hey, Clark. Is your mom around?

124
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:23,570
-I wanted to order more of her pies.
-She's in class, I can help you.

125
00:11:23,744 --> 00:11:26,804
I thought you'd be helping
Chloe proof the latest edition.

126
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,347
-She had enough help.
-Are you two still fighting?

127
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:32,417
Who said we were fighting?

128
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:37,523
Kind of caught it yesterday at the career
fair. What's going on with you two?

129
00:11:39,192 --> 00:11:40,853
Chloe likes me.

130
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:44,088
So how do you feel about her?

131
00:11:45,198 --> 00:11:47,792
Like maybe we could be
more than friends.

132
00:11:50,137 --> 00:11:53,629
-I saw her with Justin. I got kind of--
-Jealous?

133
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,666
It's like you find out this secret
and it colors everything.

134
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:02,004
Just can't believe I never saw it before.

135
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:07,181
Sometimes the right person can be in
front of your eyes and you never know.

136
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:19,792
-So how many pies did you want?
-A dozen.

137
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:25,261
How's Whitney?
I hear his dad's feeling better.

138
00:12:26,206 --> 00:12:28,197
He's great.

139
00:12:29,776 --> 00:12:31,403
Everything okay?

140
00:12:32,646 --> 00:12:34,079
Never better.

141
00:12:37,284 --> 00:12:40,651
Good luck. I hope things
work out with Chloe.

142
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:43,913
Me too.

143
00:12:44,491 --> 00:12:45,890
Bye.

144
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:16,148
Damn it.

145
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:05,368
Pete.

146
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,632
-Hey.
-Hey, you seen Chloe?

147
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:11,437
Not since English. She's probably
hanging out with Justin.

148
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:16,745
-What do you think about that guy?
-He seems pretty cool.

149
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:21,081
Never got to know him that well before,
he was always buried in a sketchpad.

150
00:14:21,254 --> 00:14:23,119
Chloe seems to like him.

151
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,622
Careful, Clark, you almost
sound a little jealous.

152
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,953
I'm not jealous, I'm concerned.

153
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:31,325
Why, because Chloe's falling for a
nice guy? It's got me worried too.

154
00:14:31,498 --> 00:14:32,829
Look.

155
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:36,400
Justin had this in his
portfolio yesterday.

156
00:14:37,771 --> 00:14:41,673
"Going Down. Doctor Loses
Hands in Freak Accident."

157
00:14:41,842 --> 00:14:44,709
-So?
-That was Justin's doctor.

158
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:47,339
Don't you think it's weird
he's carrying that?

159
00:14:47,848 --> 00:14:50,373
I liked the tragic irony.

160
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:53,579
You always talk about people
behind their backs?

161
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:55,653
-Justin, I didn't mean--
-Yes, you did.

162
00:14:55,822 --> 00:15:00,555
I start spending time with Chloe, suddenly
you realize she exists and want me out?

163
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:04,629
-Chloe and I are just friends.
-You had your chance with her.

164
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:07,463
Now you let me have mine.

165
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,318
What the hell are you doing here?

166
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:34,449
I wanted to see what kind
of young man you'd grown into.

167
00:15:34,628 --> 00:15:36,528
A very busy one.

168
00:15:37,664 --> 00:15:39,256
So if there's nothing else--

169
00:15:39,432 --> 00:15:43,459
We were close once, Alexander,
you were like a son to me.

170
00:15:43,637 --> 00:15:46,367
You were an employee.
You were paid to watch me while...

171
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:50,976
...my mother's health failed and my father
crisscrossed the globe on business.

172
00:15:51,177 --> 00:15:53,441
I loved you like my own.

173
00:15:53,613 --> 00:15:58,516
After the meteor shower, I was the one
who never looked at you differently.

174
00:15:59,853 --> 00:16:02,287
Just because you knew me
at a vulnerable point...

175
00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:05,322
...doesn't give you the right
to waltz back in a decade later.

176
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:11,887
Things have changed. I've changed.
What do you want from me?

177
00:16:12,065 --> 00:16:14,693
I want you to know
what really happened.

178
00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:19,497
-You lied to my mother on her deathbed.
-No, I didn't.

179
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:23,165
I had every intention of staying,
but your father sent me away.

180
00:16:23,343 --> 00:16:26,835
After the funeral, he called me
into his office and told me...

181
00:16:27,013 --> 00:16:31,006
...if I ever had contact with you again
that he would disinherit you.

182
00:16:31,184 --> 00:16:32,674
Why would he do that?

183
00:16:32,852 --> 00:16:36,583
Because he wanted you
to be his son, not hers.

184
00:16:36,756 --> 00:16:38,815
So why show up now?

185
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,121
Does the statute of limitations
on my father's threat expire?

186
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:48,395
I needed to see if you'd found
a way to be true to yourself...

187
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:50,934
...in spite of Lionel's efforts.

188
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,776
And to be honest,
I wanted your forgiveness.

189
00:17:02,115 --> 00:17:06,211
I'm afraid you'll have to find
a way to grant it to yourself.

190
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:13,084
Goodbye, Alexander.

191
00:17:25,138 --> 00:17:28,232
I wish everything sold as well as
your mom's organic apple pies.

192
00:17:28,408 --> 00:17:31,502
-Every little bit helps.
-Hey, Clark.

193
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:36,706
-Hey, Whitney, how's your dad?
-On the mend. Happy to be home.

194
00:17:37,684 --> 00:17:39,584
Hey. Keep Saturday night free.

195
00:17:39,753 --> 00:17:42,381
<i>Got two tickets to Our Town
at the Metropolis Playhouse.</i>

196
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:47,258
-Wow. What inspired you to do that?
-Saw you reading it at school.

197
00:17:47,427 --> 00:17:50,191
Thought I might start making up
for some lost time.

198
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:55,129
-See you.
-Bye.

199
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,038
Whitney has paid more attention to me in
the last two weeks than he has all year.

200
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:07,202
Have you talked to him about it?

201
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,948
He's seemed so happy ever
since his dad got better.

202
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:14,052
-He wants to pick up where we left off.
-How do you feel about that?

203
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:18,017
After Mr. Fordman got sick,
Whitney needed me.

204
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:22,821
Kind of defined our relationship.
Now we need to redefine it.

205
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:25,190
There's a lot of that going on.

206
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:30,025
-How are things with Chloe?
-Unresolved.

207
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:33,139
What are you gonna do?

208
00:18:33,306 --> 00:18:37,208
I don't know, just don't want
to lose a friend in the process.

209
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:40,210
Once you've crossed that line,
you can't go back.

210
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:46,377
Chloe gave that same advice
about someone else.

211
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,211
What happened?

212
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,884
-Decided to stay friends.
-Do you regret that decision?

213
00:18:56,229 --> 00:19:01,633
Yeah. I let that moment slip away
and I don't think I'll ever get it back.

214
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,936
I don't want to make
that same mistake twice.

215
00:19:16,216 --> 00:19:20,380
Hey. I just emailed the partial license
plate details of your hit-and-run...

216
00:19:20,553 --> 00:19:24,011
...to my contact at the DMV. I told him
to start with cars in the county.

217
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,682
He said that he would fax me
whatever information he found.

218
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:29,920
Wow.

219
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:34,900
Oh, here, it took me all night.

220
00:19:39,472 --> 00:19:41,303
Oh, wow.

221
00:19:42,742 --> 00:19:46,508
-It's beautiful.
-Well, so are you.

222
00:19:49,215 --> 00:19:53,208
Did you know that after that car hit me
and I was lying in the road...

223
00:19:53,386 --> 00:19:58,016
-...I kept picturing your face?
-Me? Why me?

224
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:01,549
Because I always had
the biggest crush on you.

225
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:06,665
And I was too afraid to do anything.
I thought, here I am about to die...

226
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:10,166
...and I'm never gonna get the
chance to tell her how I feel.

227
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,501
But when you started emailing me
when I was in the hospital...

228
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:20,875
...I knew that this was my chance and I
wasn't going to let you get away twice.

229
00:20:25,618 --> 00:20:28,086
I fought my way back for you.

230
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,685
What just happened?

231
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:06,691
-Can you keep an open mind?
-Sure.

232
00:21:07,627 --> 00:21:09,822
Something happened to me
after the accident...

233
00:21:09,996 --> 00:21:13,454
...and when I was in the hospital
I found that I could move things.

234
00:21:14,634 --> 00:21:17,797
-With my mind.
-Like telekinesis?

235
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:21,566
Am I freaking you out?

236
00:21:22,475 --> 00:21:25,808
Believe it or not,
I have seen stranger things.

237
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:29,745
Because I don't want
to end up on your wall.

238
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:35,786
Don't worry, you won't. Now,
let's make everything float again.

239
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,127
Hey, Chloe, can l--?

240
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:52,766
-Can I talk to you outside for a second?
-Yeah, sure, Clark.

241
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:55,271
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

242
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:17,896
Don't you think this Justin
thing is moving a little too fast?

243
00:22:18,064 --> 00:22:22,433
We've been emailing for six months.
I know him better than I know you.

244
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:25,670
-Did he say what happened to his doctor?
-No.

245
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:29,403
But he did tell me that you were
talking about him behind his back.

246
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:32,976
-I was just looking out for you, Chloe.
-What's with you, Clark?

247
00:22:33,146 --> 00:22:34,807
Do you have some savior complex?

248
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:39,441
If I'm in trouble you'll rescue me. Other
than that you're emotionally unavailable.

249
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:43,111
I just don't want you getting involved
with Justin because you're mad at me.

250
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:46,554
Believe it or not, Clark, my world
does not revolve around you.

251
00:22:46,726 --> 00:22:49,354
Why can't you accept that
I've found someone special...

252
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:52,828
...and unlike you, I'm willing
to take a chance?

253
00:23:20,593 --> 00:23:25,428
Just tell me one thing,
was it easy to lie to everybody?

254
00:23:25,898 --> 00:23:31,165
-Justin? What are you doing here?
-Reliving old memories.

255
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:33,865
I think you should go home.

256
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:42,470
I was only halfway across the crosswalk
when your car came barreling around.

257
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:45,717
Hit me so hard, it felt
like I'd been broken in half.

258
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:48,415
I don't know what you're talking about.

259
00:23:50,757 --> 00:23:53,920
I remember lying in the street,
blood dripping into my eyes...

260
00:23:54,093 --> 00:23:58,792
...watching your taillights disappear.
You didn't even bother to stop.

261
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,265
It wasn't me.

262
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:13,276
It started in the hospital.

263
00:24:13,446 --> 00:24:17,780
Maybe as a way to compensate for
the motor skills I'd lost in my hands.

264
00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:21,485
I was immobilized in a total body cast.

265
00:24:21,654 --> 00:24:24,555
Then I found that I could move
things just by thinking.

266
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:37,627
But that didn't replace what I'd lost.

267
00:24:39,205 --> 00:24:41,799
Because nothing could ever do that.

268
00:24:48,281 --> 00:24:50,408
Justin, stop it!

269
00:24:50,783 --> 00:24:55,379
Do you know what it feels like
to be hit by a 2000-pound car?

270
00:25:26,152 --> 00:25:28,313
Hey, Lex, what are you
doing here so late?

271
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:32,015
Came to talk to your parents about the
settlement. What are you reading?

272
00:25:38,264 --> 00:25:40,255
<i>Men are From Mars,
Women are From Venus?</i>

273
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:43,459
I'm trying to get an insight
into the female psyche.

274
00:25:43,636 --> 00:25:48,437
I seriously doubt you'll find it
in here. What's the problem?

275
00:25:49,575 --> 00:25:53,306
I've got these two amazing friends
who both happen to be girls.

276
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,416
For argument's sake,
let's call them Lana and Chloe.

277
00:25:59,085 --> 00:26:02,714
I've always liked Lana,
but I could never get near her.

278
00:26:03,122 --> 00:26:06,114
I found out that Chloe likes me,
I may have feelings for her too.

279
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:07,759
Which one do you want to pursue?

280
00:26:07,927 --> 00:26:10,259
I want to protect my
friendship with both.

281
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:12,897
Then you'll never get either one.

282
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:17,561
Thanks. Think I'll stick with the book.

283
00:26:17,737 --> 00:26:21,229
Clark, love isn't about playing
it safe, it's about risks.

284
00:26:21,407 --> 00:26:24,308
Unless you put yourself
out there, you'll never know.

285
00:26:24,477 --> 00:26:28,971
-Have you ever been in love before?
-I've only loved two women in my life.

286
00:26:29,148 --> 00:26:33,141
-One died and the other betrayed me.
-I'm sorry.

287
00:26:34,053 --> 00:26:36,487
Some people are meant to be alone.

288
00:26:43,563 --> 00:26:48,591
-Mom, what is it?
-It's Principal Kwan.

289
00:26:48,768 --> 00:26:51,464
He was killed in an accident.

290
00:26:58,644 --> 00:27:02,080
-Hey, guys. How are you holding up?
-I still can't believe this happened.

291
00:27:02,248 --> 00:27:05,649
Putting together a memorial issue but
when you're looking for pictures...

292
00:27:05,818 --> 00:27:09,811
...you never find them. Pete, can you
check the library files? One more time?

293
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:11,923
-Sure.
-Thank you.

294
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:17,586
Got Kwan's police report. His car was
still on, it must have slipped into gear.

295
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:21,494
-Chloe, are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

296
00:27:22,034 --> 00:27:24,468
-I can't find anything in this office!
-Let me help.

297
00:27:24,637 --> 00:27:26,571
No, thank you.

298
00:27:30,343 --> 00:27:32,140
Chloe, look at this.

299
00:27:33,713 --> 00:27:37,809
The first three numbers of Kwan's license
plate match Justin's hit-and-run driver.

300
00:27:37,984 --> 00:27:39,576
-What are you getting at?
-Well...

301
00:27:39,752 --> 00:27:42,186
...there's a lot of weird accidents
around this guy.

302
00:27:42,355 --> 00:27:45,324
Clark, you are seriously barking
up the wrong tree here.

303
00:27:45,491 --> 00:27:47,425
Did you get a response from the DMV?

304
00:27:47,593 --> 00:27:49,720
-No, it never came through.
-Yes, you did.

305
00:27:49,895 --> 00:27:52,921
4:43 yesterday. Around
the time you were here with Justin.

306
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:55,431
-He couldn't have done it.
-Because you like him?

307
00:27:55,601 --> 00:27:59,037
No, because I know him and
I know he wouldn't hurt anyone.

308
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:06,877
I hope you're right.

309
00:28:16,522 --> 00:28:22,392
"I celebrate myself and what
I assume you shall assume."

310
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:27,624
"For every atom belonging to me
as good belongs to you."

311
00:28:29,602 --> 00:28:32,070
Sounds like a description
of family, doesn't it?

312
00:28:32,238 --> 00:28:35,730
Not ours. Since when
do you read poetry?

313
00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:39,977
We're selling Cadmus Labs, Lex.

314
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:44,472
Our deal memo gives me 50 percent
ownership with veto rights.

315
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,210
I don't recall you asking my opinion.

316
00:28:47,386 --> 00:28:49,445
We only bought Cadmus
to bankrupt Sir Harry.

317
00:28:49,622 --> 00:28:52,921
After we pumped and dumped the stock,
the company's worthless.

318
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:54,923
It served its purpose.

319
00:28:55,227 --> 00:28:58,685
You didn't come all this way
to talk about Cadmus.

320
00:28:59,632 --> 00:29:03,124
I understand Pamela's
back in the States.

321
00:29:03,302 --> 00:29:06,396
-And that she paid you a visit.
-Did you come to disinherit me?

322
00:29:06,672 --> 00:29:09,436
-Is that what she told you?
-Is it true?

323
00:29:10,576 --> 00:29:14,808
Your mother was
an extraordinary woman.

324
00:29:15,147 --> 00:29:21,017
But her taste in help left a lot to be
desired. Pamela was a hanger-on.

325
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:24,321
She convinced your mother
to leave her all that stock, then...

326
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,856
...she disappeared before
the body was even cold.

327
00:29:27,293 --> 00:29:29,921
You took time out of your busy
schedule to tell me that?

328
00:29:30,096 --> 00:29:35,193
I know how much she meant to you and I
don't want her using emotional tyranny...

329
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:37,801
-...to hit you up for money.
-Why would she do that?

330
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,267
She's got plenty of stock.

331
00:29:39,605 --> 00:29:42,699
Probably she doesn't want to sell it
to pay her medical bills.

332
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,433
What medical bills?

333
00:29:45,678 --> 00:29:51,446
-She didn't tell you. How noble.
-Tell me what?

334
00:29:52,218 --> 00:29:56,279
She's dying, Lex. Cancer.

335
00:29:58,424 --> 00:30:02,292
Probably all those years sitting
in the sun in Saint-Tropez.

336
00:30:05,865 --> 00:30:09,357
-What does she want?
-Forgiveness.

337
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,997
And what did you tell her?

338
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:15,969
To get out.

339
00:30:18,177 --> 00:30:23,479
No. She doesn't know you
very well, does she?

340
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:48,640
What are you doing in here?

341
00:30:48,808 --> 00:30:54,246
Danny, I'm really sorry about
what happened to your dad.

342
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:01,716
I don't understand what happened.
He had the car keys with him.

343
00:31:01,887 --> 00:31:07,052
It's like something just smashed
the car right into him.

344
00:31:09,228 --> 00:31:12,129
Danny, did you know a Justin Gaines?

345
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:15,463
Do you know if he came
by here last night?

346
00:31:15,634 --> 00:31:17,465
No, why?

347
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:22,998
I think Justin believes your father
was responsible for the accident.

348
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:25,735
That's crazy. You should leave.

349
00:31:25,911 --> 00:31:30,041
He matched part of your dad's license
plate to the hit-and-run driver's.

350
00:31:40,392 --> 00:31:42,724
Is there a chance Justin's right?

351
00:31:44,096 --> 00:31:46,394
My dad didn't deserve this.

352
00:31:49,735 --> 00:31:53,000
Your dad wasn't the one
driving the car, was he?

353
00:31:57,643 --> 00:31:59,668
You're the one who hit Justin.

354
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:01,808
My dad...

355
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,350
...he was just trying to protect me.

356
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:32,206
Chloe?

357
00:32:36,282 --> 00:32:39,809
-My mom said you were here.
-Oh, I wanted to surprise you.

358
00:32:39,985 --> 00:32:43,853
I didn't see you at school today.
Did you hear about Principal Kwan?

359
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:47,517
-I did. That's really weird, right?
-Yeah.

360
00:32:47,693 --> 00:32:50,457
I guess you never know
when your time's up.

361
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:55,726
Which is why I think we should make
the most of the time that we have.

362
00:32:57,736 --> 00:33:01,570
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. I forgot, I just remembered...

363
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:05,509
...I told Clark I'd meet him at his house.

364
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:11,848
For someone that is out of the picture,
you sure spend a lot of time with him.

365
00:33:12,017 --> 00:33:16,545
Don't worry. Today I plan on telling him
exactly what's going on between us.

366
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,911
You did the right thing, Clark.
Convincing Danny to turn himself in.

367
00:33:45,084 --> 00:33:49,350
-His father's dead. He's going to jail.
-Some secrets destroy families.

368
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:52,581
Clark, Chloe's on the phone,
she sounds really freaked out.

369
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,523
-Chloe, what's up?
-I've been calling all over the place.

370
00:33:57,696 --> 00:34:00,460
I really screwed up, Justin
is involved, you were right.

371
00:34:00,632 --> 00:34:03,465
<i>-Well, calm down. Where are you?
-In your barn.</i>

372
00:34:03,635 --> 00:34:06,160
I haven't been completely
honest with you, Clark.

373
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:09,239
I know how Justin caused
those accidents.

374
00:34:11,543 --> 00:34:12,874
Chloe? Chloe!

375
00:34:20,285 --> 00:34:21,946
Justin?

376
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,371
How could you betray me? How could
you betray what we had together?

377
00:35:09,668 --> 00:35:10,999
Oh, no!

378
00:35:14,807 --> 00:35:18,766
That's what I love about you,
Chloe. You're a fighter.

379
00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:48,034
I'm sorry. I didn't want it
to end like this.

380
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:03,483
-How did you do that?
-You killed the wrong man.

381
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:05,987
-You're lying.
-His son just turned himself in.

382
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:08,916
-He was the one who hit you.
-That is not true!

383
00:36:09,094 --> 00:36:12,928
You said you cared about Chloe. How
many people are you willing to kill?

384
00:36:13,098 --> 00:36:14,827
Just one more.

385
00:36:18,203 --> 00:36:21,138
You've really got to stick
those landings, Clark.

386
00:36:22,107 --> 00:36:24,200
You can't win, Justin.

387
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,189
Chloe, are you okay?

388
00:37:14,526 --> 00:37:18,826
-You're the last person I expected.
-Why didn't you tell me?

389
00:37:18,997 --> 00:37:22,728
-It's not your concern.
-It's not my concern that you're dying?

390
00:37:24,736 --> 00:37:29,639
-I could help, I can get you treatment.
-I didn't come to you for help or pity...

391
00:37:29,808 --> 00:37:33,437
...I came because I have
nothing left to lose.

392
00:37:38,584 --> 00:37:43,886
The truth is, I'm ashamed that it took
metastasizing to give me the courage.

393
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:48,618
I let that bastard frighten me
into submission for so long.

394
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:55,389
I was too scared to even tell you
just once how much you mean to me.

395
00:37:57,769 --> 00:38:01,034
How much I wanted
to help you grow up.

396
00:38:01,273 --> 00:38:06,233
I wish you had. I might be a better man.

397
00:38:07,145 --> 00:38:12,378
The fact that you're here speaks
volumes about the man that you are.

398
00:38:16,455 --> 00:38:18,980
Your mother would be proud.

399
00:38:23,895 --> 00:38:28,355
-I really miss her.
-So do I.

400
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:57,121
-I just spoke to Justin's parents.
-How's he doing?

401
00:38:57,296 --> 00:39:00,663
He's in the psychiatric ward. The police
don't know what to charge him with...

402
00:39:00,832 --> 00:39:02,925
...but at least he won't hurt anybody.

403
00:39:04,436 --> 00:39:10,671
So should we do the "I told you so" part
or is my perennial bad judgment implicit?

404
00:39:10,876 --> 00:39:12,935
Chloe, I wish I were wrong.

405
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:17,678
What is it with me? I can spot Wall of
Weird material from a mile away...

406
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:20,010
...but put it in front of me
and I'm oblivious.

407
00:39:20,285 --> 00:39:23,049
You're not oblivious, you're trusting.

408
00:39:23,555 --> 00:39:26,388
You're strong enough to take risks
with your emotions.

409
00:39:26,558 --> 00:39:28,958
I wish I were as brave as you.

410
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:33,491
I still have those tickets
to the journalism convention.

411
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:38,462
It'd be a good chance for us
to spend some time together.

412
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:42,030
Okay, it's a date.

413
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:10,330
Whitney, we need to talk.

414
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:15,196
What is it? What happened?

415
00:40:16,308 --> 00:40:18,173
It's my dad.

416
00:43:08,313 --> 00:43:09,302
