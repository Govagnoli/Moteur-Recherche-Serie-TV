1
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,408
Hello, gentlemen.

2
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:21,053
- Hey, Chloe.
- What are you doing to those poor citrus?

3
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:24,019
Apparently, there's enough acid
in them to act as a battery.

4
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,987
How very Survivor of you.

5
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,650
What are you gonna call it,
a Clockwork Orange?

6
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:31,092
Don't you wish
you were the first one to say that?

7
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,930
- Sure, you can use our outlet.
- Thanks.

8
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,734
What's up with that guy?

9
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:46,468
His name is Cyrus Krupp.
He transferred in a couple of weeks ago.

10
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:50,912
They asked me to give him the new-student
tour, but he said he wouldn't be here long.

11
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,587
Maybe that's why he's trying so hard
to win friends and influence people.

12
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,018
- Bye.
- Bye.

13
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,568
What are you doing, man?

14
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,437
Hey, what are you doing?

15
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:20,873
Hey, freak, why don't you jack in
somewhere else?

16
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,708
Give me those.

17
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,046
Check it out, man.
Loser's listening to a dial tone.

18
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,882
You don't have the capacity
to comprehend that sound.

19
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,921
You calling me stupid?

20
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,856
Let's just say you're not one
of mankind's brightest lights.

21
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:39,660
- Hey! Don't damage my transmitter!
- Don't damage his transmitter!

22
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,130
The transmitter!

23
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,336
Guys, why don't you
just leave him alone.

24
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,309
- Stay out of it, Kent.
- Yeah, back off, Kent.

25
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,208
I don't want to hurt you, Kyle.
Just give my transmitter back.

26
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,485
- Get out of here, freak.
- I'm warning you.

27
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,352
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

28
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,356
Oh, yeah.

29
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,660
- Oh, now he's crying.
- Oh, yeah.

30
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,559
- That's right. Go home to Mama.
- Bye.

31
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,398
- Who's crying now?
- Don't damage the transmitter.

32
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,536
Now, leave me alone!

33
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,521
Hey. Tyson, haven't seen you
in a long time.

34
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:50,129
I finally got some time off from the Talon,
I thought I'd take him out for a good run.

35
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,422
He hasn't been out much since Whitney.

36
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,333
Chloe told me what happened
at the electronics lab. Pretty wild.

37
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,908
It was definitely weird.
It's like Cyrus is in his own world.

38
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,273
Takes teenage alienation
to a whole new level.

39
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,481
Well, we all have our ways
of escaping from our lives.

40
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,744
I ride, Chloe writes and you...

41
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:20,115
You do incredibly strenuous farm chores
by yourself.

42
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,259
Well, I guess you know
my deepest and darkest secret now.

43
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:31,232
- Whoa, boy.
- He's been doing that a lot lately.

44
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,100
- Thought some air would do him good.
- Did you call the vet?

45
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,072
Yeah, he doesn't know
what's wrong with him.

46
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,438
Chalked it up to old age.

47
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,671
Whitney's mom wants to sell him.

48
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,112
She can't afford to stable him anymore.

49
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,279
Why don't you board him here?

50
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,586
Would your parents be okay with it?

51
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,493
I don't see why not.
It is a farm, after all.

52
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,763
Thanks.

53
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:13,912
- Why didn't you tell me about it?
- I thought I bought every copy in Smallville.

54
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:20,378
Helen, I've been living
with this kind of thing my whole life.

55
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:23,647
I'm sorry they've come after you too.
I was trying to protect you.

56
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,115
You can't, Lex. It's not just the paper.

57
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:30,524
I mean, people have been treating me
differently ever since I started dating you.

58
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,359
I've sacrificed so much to get where I am.

59
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,625
And now your reputation is being trashed
by rumor and innuendo?

60
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,501
- Is that why you haven't moved in?
- I already told you...

61
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,472
...my lease isn't up yet,
and I haven't had time to pack.

62
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,236
Okay.

63
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,240
I'll pay to break your lease...

64
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,382
...and I'll have movers
at your place in an hour.

65
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,856
What's stopping you now?

66
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,484
I need to do this on my own schedule.

67
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:10,798
I want you to know
that I completely believe in us...

68
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,797
...but if you want to back out...

69
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,765
...I'll understand.

70
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,246
Can you make it two hours?

71
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,159
Hey, Kent.

72
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,068
I know your secret.

73
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,467
Lana told me
you're boarding Whitney's horse.

74
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,610
Oh, yeah, that. Right.

75
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,179
- You made her year, you know.
- Well, Tyson's really important to her.

76
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,215
She didn't want another part
of her past just taken away.

77
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,875
And she'll be here every day.
Just like old times.

78
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,647
There's nothing romantic
about mucking out horse stalls.

79
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,415
Clark.

80
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:09,425
- I see the electronics lab is still closed.
- The fire marshals are investigating...

81
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,119
...Cyrus' pyrotechnics.

82
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:16,234
Did you know Principal Reynolds suspended
him and he confiscated his science project?

83
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,734
Do you have any idea how he did it?

84
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:23,001
Could have been a trick.
Or it could be meteor-rock inspired.

85
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,077
Or he could be an alien.

86
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,046
- Alien? Why would you say that?
- Rumors from his old school.

87
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:34,653
He went to junior high in Grandville and told
some kids there he was extraterrestrial.

88
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:38,689
Needless to say, they sent him
to a distant corner in the social galaxy.

89
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:43,926
- He didn't do anything super, did he?
- Like start fire with his eyes?

90
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:50,197
But he did make it a habit of running away.
Last time, cops found him in a field, naked.

91
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:54,100
Cyrus was pointing to the sky saying,
"They're coming to take me home."

92
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,037
That incident landed him
in the mental institution.

93
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,644
You don't think
he's really an alien, do you?

94
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,940
No. But wouldn't it be awesome
if he was, though?

95
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,942
- Yeah, it'd be the story of the century.
- This isn't about Pulitzers, Clark.

96
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,055
I mean, can you imagine
being from another planet?

97
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:14,383
The experiences you could share?

98
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,529
- It wouldn't freak you out?
- Oh, compared to most people...

99
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,858
...I think aliens would be a step up.

100
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,154
Cyrus.

101
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,325
What are you doing here, Clark?

102
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,394
I heard about your suspension,
wanted to make sure you were okay.

103
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,570
High school is irrelevant.

104
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,773
Just gives me more time
to concentrate on my work.

105
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,470
- Where's your parents?
- Foster parents. They work late.

106
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,810
They don't bother me
as long as they get their monthly check.

107
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,046
Is this interrogation over?

108
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,049
I heard about the rumor
from your old school.

109
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,193
That I'm an alien.
You've come to see if it's true.

110
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,361
I have an open mind.

111
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,489
If I showed you any of my other
special powers, would that appease you?

112
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,396
Go away, Clark.

113
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,938
You're like all the others.
I won't be ridiculed by your kind anymore.

114
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,837
I'm not here to make fun of you.
Or to get you in trouble.

115
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,205
- Then what do you want?
- The truth.

116
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,074
I promise I won't tell anyone.

117
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,586
I input these coordinates into my
transmitter, send a signal to my planet.

118
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,419
- How do you know they're correct?
- I used to have these weird dreams.

119
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,223
That's when they were given to me.
Afterwards, I'd wake up in strange places.

120
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:02,231
Frightened my old foster parents.
They had me locked away eventually.

121
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,469
Can't imagine any other race
being as barbaric as humans.

122
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:09,335
- Why, what'd they do to you?
- Tried to make me believe I was crazy.

123
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,941
That I was really one of you.

124
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,838
Cyrus, I want to believe you.

125
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,506
What kind of proof do you have?

126
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:21,175
Whatever proof I had was destroyed
the day of the meteor shower.

127
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,984
That's when I arrived on Earth.

128
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:28,058
An elderly couple found me
on the outskirts of town and raised me.

129
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,594
After they died,
I bounced around between foster parents...

130
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,460
...but I kept trying to get back here.
- Why?

131
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,467
Smallville's ground zero for the signal.

132
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,831
I have to be here
so my real parents can take me home.

133
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,079
Martha?

134
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,045
Martha, you down here...?

135
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,094
Sweetheart, is anything wrong?

136
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:08,666
I'm just thinking of Clark
traveling millions of miles through space.

137
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:13,464
How the ship protected him,
and what it did for me.

138
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,774
The ship has given us two miracles.

139
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,810
I hope you're right.

140
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,613
Martha, what is it?

141
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,851
I'm not sure. I'm...
I'm scared.

142
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,827
I'm having these terrible headaches
and mood swings...

143
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,694
...and my sleeping patterns
are all upside-down.

144
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,768
Dr. Baker said
that you're perfectly healthy...

145
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,269
...and that your pregnancy's
absolutely normal.

146
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,670
Except for the way
I was able to conceive.

147
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:54,340
I want Helen Bryce to examine me,
just to make sure.

148
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,914
- No.
- I trust her.

149
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,348
She's seen Clark's blood. She knows
that something brought me back...

150
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,750
...and she hasn't sent anybody
knocking at our door for answers.

151
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,359
Dr. Helen Bryce is intimately involved
with Lex Luthor.

152
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:11,189
If you need a second opinion, get it
from any other doctor but Helen Bryce.

153
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,887
Why not?

154
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:17,293
Because I don't want our family secrets
becoming pillow talk.

155
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,911
I never figured you
for having an identity crisis, Clark.

156
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:42,657
- It's for a friend.
- Haven't heard that one before.

157
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:47,595
What's your friend's problem,
Napoleon or messiah complex?

158
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,962
Actually, he thinks he's an alien.

159
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,227
So that proves he isn't.

160
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,210
Clark, if you were really an alien,
would you tell people about it?

161
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,639
Probably not.

162
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,945
Let me guess.
Your friend, he's a little odd.

163
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,013
Spends a lot of time alone,
thinks no one understands him.

164
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:12,320
I just described myself in high school.
It's a classic outsider profile.

165
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,187
I'd say he's just trying to get attention.

166
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,528
You believe
there are aliens among us, Clark?

167
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:27,166
- I just want to help him.
- Give me his name. I'll talk to some people.

168
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:31,433
I promised to keep it private.
He's trying to avoid any more doctors.

169
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,312
By the way, I have to congratulate you.

170
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,417
Offering to board Whitney's horse?
That was a masterful stroke.

171
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,782
I didn't do anything. She needed a place
for her horse and I offered.

172
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,651
So did I. But she turned me down.

173
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,225
Told her she could keep him
in the mansion stables, free of charge.

174
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,824
Guess she was holding out
for the right offer.

175
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,573
Clark.

176
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,319
- Dad, what's going on?
- I don't know, son.

177
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,888
We got Tyson out of the trailer,
Lana was walking him and he collapsed.

178
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,653
She's pretty upset. Why don't
you stay with her, I'll call the vet.

179
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,201
- Not feeling too good?
- I've seen him sick before, but not this bad.

180
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,343
There's help on the way.

181
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,573
I can't lose Tyson too.

182
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,220
He's gonna be fine, Lana, he's a fighter.

183
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,878
Just like his owner.

184
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,861
How could you betray me?

185
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,293
You told that Chloe girl my secret.
She wants to interview me.

186
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,630
- What?
- They'll send me to another shrink.

187
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:09,535
- They could lock me away again.
- This is not the time nor place for this.

188
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,602
I never should have trusted you.

189
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,603
Clark.

190
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,488
- What's wrong with him?
- We don't know, the vet's on the way.

191
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:53,747
It's okay. You don't need all these people
poking and prodding you, boy.

192
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:55,748
I'll make you better.

193
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,566
Hey.

194
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,434
Hey.

195
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:01,211
- I don't know why you're so skeptical.
- It's hard to believe that that kid...

196
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:05,221
...could heal a horse by touching it.
It sounds like an old revival-meeting story.

197
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,985
The vet couldn't believe it,
but he said Tyson's healthy.

198
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,958
Cyrus wouldn't be the first
in Smallville with abilities.

199
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,758
Except I don't think he's from Smallville.

200
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:19,835
Look, this is gonna sound crazy and I didn't
believe it myself at first, but I'm starting to.

201
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:23,907
I think there's a very strong possibility
that Cyrus is from Krypton.

202
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,843
Why would you think that?

203
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:30,377
- He said he was.
- He said he was from Krypton?

204
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:34,712
Well, he didn't use the name,
but I didn't know it until Dr. Swann told me.

205
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,721
But he said he came to Earth during
the meteor shower. And there's more.

206
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,327
Yesterday I saw him start a fire
with heat from his eyes.

207
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,428
What about strength or speed?

208
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,332
- No, but...
- Clark.

209
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,800
Son, we know you want to believe this,
but you don't even have the ability to heal.

210
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,830
That doesn't prove anything.
I didn't get heat vision till last year.

211
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,806
Maybe we'll develop the same abilities.

212
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,969
Or maybe people on Krypton
don't have the same abilities at all.

213
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:05,207
We don't know for sure,
we've never met anyone else from there.

214
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:08,285
Dr. Swann said you were
the last survivor of your planet.

215
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,581
What if Dr. Swann is wrong?

216
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:15,092
Look, don't you see? If I'm right,
this means I'm not alone anymore.

217
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,630
Can I help you, ma'am?

218
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:03,334
- I was looking for the solarium.
- That's in the south wing. I'll escort you.

219
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,244
You know, Lex gave me this master key.

220
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:14,317
It's supposed to open every door
in the mansion, but I can't open that one.

221
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,320
That room is strictly off-limits.
The only person with a key is Mr. Luthor.

222
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,720
Shall we?

223
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,163
Hey, Kent, where's your little buddy?

224
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,463
You tell him payback's gonna suck.

225
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,633
- Magic.
- What?

226
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,536
That was how Cyrus started the fire.

227
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:41,702
The fire marshals found strips of magnesium
powder hidden behind the blackboard.

228
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,338
All Cyrus had to do was wait
for the right moment, hit the detonator...

229
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,715
...and before you can say "presto,"
instant inferno.

230
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:57,892
- I didn't see him use a detonator.
- But illusion is the art of misdirection, Clark.

231
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:03,098
Trust me, this kid is more David Blaine
than he is Wall of Weird.

232
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,733
Well, that still doesn't explain
how he cured Tyson.

233
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,900
Yeah, I haven't figured that one out yet.

234
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,510
But I'd bet that he faked
that one too somehow.

235
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,615
- No, I was there. It was real.
- Well, I'm not discounting the possibility...

236
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,115
...that he may have
some magic healing power.

237
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:23,550
But if he does, it's probably
a byproduct of meteorite poisoning.

238
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,551
He is no more extraterrestrial than you are.

239
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,823
When I saw your name on the chart,
I thought there was a mistake.

240
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,458
I haven't had a new patient
since the Inquisitor hit the stands.

241
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,731
People can be small-minded.
I hope things work out for you.

242
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,273
Thank you, Mrs. Kent.

243
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,436
So...

244
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,877
According to the charts your OB sent over...

245
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,644
...your pregnancy's
been smooth sailing so far.

246
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,720
I don't know about that.

247
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,915
Whatever we talk about
is confidential, right?

248
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,357
- Of course.
- You won't tell anyone?

249
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:06,497
Not even significant others?

250
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:11,331
- You're worried I'll tell Lex?
- Jonathan. He doesn't know I'm here.

251
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,430
I can assure you, everything in this office
stays between you and me.

252
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:23,504
Mrs. Kent, does this have anything
to do with Clark's unusual blood work...

253
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,776
...or your miraculous recovery?
Because I'll be honest with you.

254
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,750
I still don't understand
what I saw that day.

255
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,085
Martha...

256
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:37,922
...if you really want me to help,
you've gotta be completely honest with me.

257
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:44,435
For your safety. And the baby's.

258
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,071
Cyrus.

259
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:53,742
Lex?

260
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:58,546
- What are you doing here?
- I've always wanted to meet an alien.

261
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,587
When I heard what happened
with Lana's horse...

262
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,814
...I realized this Cyrus
must be the friend you mentioned.

263
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,451
- You said he was fantasizing.
- After what we found in the cave...

264
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,427
...I try and keep an open mind.

265
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,429
Take a look at this.

266
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,894
See, I've always had a theory
that the meteor shower...

267
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:23,769
...would have been a perfect cover
for an alien spacecraft to land on Earth.

268
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:28,679
Anyway, looks like we both wasted a trip.
You want a ride?

269
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,314
No, I think I'll stay and wait.

270
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:33,246
Tell your friend I'd like to buy him
a latte sometime.

271
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,249
See you later, Clark.

272
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,557
I don't trust your friend.

273
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,225
I know you faked the fire, Cyrus.

274
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:51,925
I don't deny it.

275
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,937
Kyle and his intelligence-challenged
comrades...

276
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:58,440
...have harassed me since I got here.
- Why didn't you use your powers?

277
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:03,104
- I only have the power to heal, not to harm.
- You still claim that you cured that horse?

278
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,680
Believe whatever you want.

279
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,385
Did you draw these?

280
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,054
That's how I got to Earth.

281
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,486
Where's the spaceship?

282
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:19,960
I don't know.

283
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:24,800
But you remember coming here.

284
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,563
Remember those dreams
I told you about?

285
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,905
I dream about my parents too.

286
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,438
And what it'll be like the day I go home.

287
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,142
I believe you, Cyrus.

288
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,182
You do?

289
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:51,255
That makes you the first person
who doesn't think I'm crazy.

290
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,904
Wow, you built this?

291
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:04,837
What is it?

292
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,410
My transmission tower.

293
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,012
How does it work?

294
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,412
At the appointed time, I'll send a signal
and my parents will come.

295
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:17,351
They'll transport me up to their ship,
and then they'll take me home.

296
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:21,754
I can see how this would be a little difficult
to explain to a group of psychiatrists.

297
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,760
I wish that were my only problem.

298
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:28,126
I'm supposed to send a signal
at midnight tomorrow...

299
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,996
...but I don't have my transmitter.

300
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,502
After the incident in the electronics lab,
Reynolds confiscated it.

301
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:38,008
- Can't you build another one?
- There isn't time.

302
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:41,873
The conditions necessary for my departure
only occur once every 200 years.

303
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:47,280
If I don't get that transmitter back,
I'll never get home.

304
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,020
Please. Help me.

305
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,791
What are you losers doing?

306
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,761
If I were you, I'd get back in my truck
and go home. Now!

307
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:38,391
- Take it easy, Cyrus.
- Lf you don't leave us alone, you'll regret it.

308
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,233
Save it, reject. We know how you
faked that fire to make us look like morons.

309
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,898
They're all laughing at us,
so we'll kick your ass.

310
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,703
Yeah, that's right.

311
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,837
This time you didn't have a chance to
set up one of your little tricks, did you?

312
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,416
I'm warning you, Kyle. Leave me alone.

313
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,990
- My truck!
- What's going on?

314
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,731
Come on, let's get out of here!

315
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,826
I warned you, now leave!

316
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:21,939
- Way to go, Cyrus, you did it.
- No, I didn't, Clark.

317
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,445
- You did.
- That's crazy.

318
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,585
Now I know why you've been helping me,
why you believe me.

319
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,186
Cyrus, I don't know
what you're talking about.

320
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,321
You're an alien too.

321
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,336
I can't believe Cyrus knows your secret.

322
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,947
What was I supposed to do, Pete?
Beat up those guys?

323
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,846
Grab Cyrus and run away
at 1000 miles an hour?

324
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,782
I didn't have much of a choice.

325
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:06,253
- Well, have you told your parents yet?
- No.

326
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:09,052
- They'd just freak out.
- And they'd have a right to.

327
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:12,287
I mean, how long until
Cyrus tells somebody?

328
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,464
It's not like he's exactly stable.

329
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,898
- He's not gonna tell anyone.
- Clark, how do you know that?

330
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:23,234
Look at this.
The coordinates that Cyrus gave me...

331
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,844
...are for the same solar system
as Krypton.

332
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:31,480
Clark, dozens of astronomers
have written about the meteor showers.

333
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,279
- He could have used their research.
- First the drawings of the ship, now this?

334
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:39,549
It's too much of a coincidence. Maybe my
parents weren't alone in saving their child.

335
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:42,557
If you wanna know,
I could take him a piece of meteor rock.

336
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,327
- No, it's called Kryptonite.
- Kryptonite.

337
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,762
- Is that with a C or a K?
- Clark, are you up there?

338
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,230
K.

339
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,404
Cyrus was at the Talon
when Child Protective Services took him.

340
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:57,336
- What?
- His foster parents couldn't handle him...

341
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:02,412
...so they're sending him to the
Smallville Medical Center for assessment.

342
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,158
Clark.

343
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,993
I don't want to be locked up again.

344
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,295
You don't know what it's like.

345
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,497
- The doctors. The tests.
- What can I do?

346
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:34,174
If I'm not on that tower at midnight...

347
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,279
...I'm gonna be stranded
on this world forever.

348
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,391
You gotta get out of here.

349
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,364
Clark.

350
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,297
- Come with me.
- What are you talking about?

351
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,964
You're not meant for this Earth
any more than I am.

352
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,337
I'll take you back to your real home.

353
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,145
This is my real home.

354
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,581
Everything I care about is on Earth.

355
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:20,956
Good luck, Cyrus.

356
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,817
You give me hope for this world, Clark.

357
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,395
I wish there were more people
like you here.

358
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:34,963
I'll send you a postcard.

359
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:43,480
Lex, we need to have a talk.

360
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,583
Is this a closet-space issue?

361
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,319
Because I could use
the walk-in across the hall.

362
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:54,522
When you asked me to move in, you gave
me a key to open every door in the house.

363
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,557
All except one.

364
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:00,455
- You've been exploring.
- At first I thought I could deal with it...

365
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,432
...but then the more I think about it,
the more it starts to bother me.

366
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,593
There's nothing of consequence
in that room.

367
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:10,229
- Then why is it locked?
- Look...

368
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:13,400
...everyone needs a place
where they can be alone.

369
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:17,241
Hear their own thoughts.
That's all that room is for me.

370
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:21,843
You are welcome to make your own space
anywhere else in the mansion.

371
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,478
I wasn't looking for a roommate.
I want someone to share my life with.

372
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:29,093
You know, you need to figure out
what kind of a relationship you want.

373
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,287
Because if this is gonna work,
there can't be any locked doors between us.

374
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,904
Hey, Clark.
Cyrus escaped from the medical center.

375
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:51,014
The Child Protective Services and the sheriff
are searching for him everywhere.

376
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,843
Take a look at this.

377
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,715
- Who are these people?
- John and Maggie Burnet...

378
00:30:56,888 --> 00:31:00,324
...and their son, William. They disappeared
the day of the meteor shower.

379
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:04,052
Rescue workers suspected they were
vaporized when their farmhouse was hit.

380
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,922
- But no remains were ever found.
- Lf the son survived...

381
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,066
...he'd be too young to remember.

382
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,293
The older couple that adopted Cyrus...

383
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:14,529
...lived half a mile away
from the Burnet house.

384
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,164
- What are you saying?
- What we're saying is, Cyrus is not an alien.

385
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,208
He's an orphan.

386
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,650
- Let him know.
- Yeah, man! Come on!

387
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:09,554
- Take it down, baby!
- Where you going, firestarter?

388
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:14,025
You'd better get off there,
because this thing is coming down!

389
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:17,065
What are you gonna do, fly away?

390
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,768
Let's teach this freak a lesson
he won't forget.

391
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,106
Come on, space boy!

392
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:29,639
- Yeah, Kyle, take it down!
- Come on, buddy!

393
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,252
Down! Bring him down!

394
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,831
No! Stop!

395
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,095
You can't do this!

396
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,007
Stop!

397
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,511
No! Not now!
You'll ruin everything!

398
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,418
Do it!

399
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,292
No!

400
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,329
Faster! Come on!

401
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,401
Stop, please! No!

402
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,817
Go! Go! Go!

403
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,591
I gotta get up there.
My parents are coming.

404
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,363
Your parents died.
In the meteor shower.

405
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,529
That's ridiculous,
my parents aren't human.

406
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,933
Hey, I think his neck's broken.

407
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,109
Cyrus, you can save him.

408
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:11,044
They're here. I can't,
I'll be stranded on this world forever.

409
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,979
- You have the power to heal.
- Why do you care about them?

410
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,781
Cyrus, don't let him die.
We both know you're better than that.

411
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,752
Come on!

412
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:02,422
I missed it. I missed it.

413
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,994
Cyrus.

414
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,166
Cyrus.

415
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,505
This is the Kansas State Police.

416
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,615
If you require assistance,
please stay where you are.

417
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:23,550
Emergency vehicles have been dispatched
and will arrive shortly.

418
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,011
Clark.

419
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,218
Clark!

420
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:28,178
The doctors say that Cyrus
had a complete mental breakdown.

421
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:32,313
His body's there but his mind is gone.

422
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,420
They don't know if he'll recover.

423
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,431
They transferred him
to a special hospital in Metropolis.

424
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,304
Son...

425
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:53,572
...how do you think Cyrus
was able to draw your ship?

426
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,806
His house was near
where you guys found me.

427
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:01,543
My guess, he was outside
and saw the ship land.

428
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:06,514
Memories stayed with him and over time
he thought that past was his own.

429
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,556
We know how much
you wanted to believe...

430
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,889
...that there could be somebody else
out there like you.

431
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,503
What is it, Clark?

432
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:28,639
Why would Cyrus pass up what he believed
was his only opportunity to go home...

433
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:33,684
...to save Kyle, the school bully?

434
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:37,179
Because he was a lot more like you
than we ever thought.

435
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,472
What is all this?

436
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,616
Montaigne said...

437
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:13,421
...obsession was the wellspring
of genius and madness.

438
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,458
This is my obsession.

439
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:22,298
I'm sure you can understand
my reluctance to show you this room.

440
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:27,895
I thought you might decide
I was a little eccentric.

441
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:16,243
There's a lot here about the Kents.

442
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,346
Yeah.

443
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:26,627
They're an interesting family.

444
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,788
Don't you think?

445
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,934
Hey.

446
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,575
Whatever Cyrus did to Tyson
wasn't temporary.

447
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:16,913
It's like he's a colt again.

448
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,339
Well, I'm glad some good
came out of all this.

449
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,782
Yeah, Cyrus seemed really Ionely.

450
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,819
Lana, what if Cyrus really
could have proven he was an alien?

451
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,455
What do you mean?

452
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:40,464
I mean, how would you feel about him
if he actually was from another planet?

453
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,370
Well...

454
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,173
I guess I'd try and keep an open mind.

455
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:52,110
You'd never feel completely comfortable
with him, would you?

456
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:55,982
Have to admit, I'd be a little freaked out.

457
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,785
Does that make me a bad person?

458
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:07,091
No. Just honest.

459
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:12,898
Clark, look.

460
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,335
Think it's a spaceship?

461
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,535
It's just a shooting star.
