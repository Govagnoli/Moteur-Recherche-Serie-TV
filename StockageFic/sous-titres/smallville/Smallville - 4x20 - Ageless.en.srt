1
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:08,727
I need help now!

2
00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:13,289
Please, you have to help us.
No, no, it isn't enough time.

3
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:16,828
What the hell's the matter
with you people? This is an emergency!

4
00:00:16,856 --> 00:00:19,025
It's too late. It's too late.

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,607
It's coming!

6
00:00:28,877 --> 00:00:31,929
Oh, god.
What's happening to me?

7
00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:41,202
I'm sorry!

8
00:00:41,944 --> 00:00:45,187
No! No, don't leave me, please!

9
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,150
Are you all right?

10
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:02,058
Yeah, what was that?

11
00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:02,860
I don't know.

12
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:05,280
I think it came from evans field.

13
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:24,367
Oh, my god.

14
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:27,308
Lana, wait. Lana!

19
00:02:55,632 --> 00:02:58,586
Last time I checked, babies don't just
fall out of the sky, mr. Kent.

20
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:00,654
It left a 30-foot crater, sheriff.

21
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:01,875
How else would you explain it?

22
00:03:01,922 --> 00:03:05,127
Well, I can'T. That's why we're conducting
a little something called an investigation.

23
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,880
What's gonna happen
to the baby now, sheriff?

24
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:11,013
Well, he'll be placed with child services
until we can find a home for him.

25
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:15,277
You did good for a change, mr. Kent.

26
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:18,718
The little critter wouldn't
be alive if not for you.

27
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:22,945
Dad,

28
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,340
this baby's parents...

29
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,651
I don't think they're from around here.

30
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:33,275
What do you mean?
You think the baby's...

31
00:03:34,191 --> 00:03:35,448
the baby's not from earth?

32
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,888
We found him in a crater,
just like you and mom found me.

33
00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:41,751
Yeah, but when we found you,
we also found a spaceship.

34
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:46,152
The truth is, we don't know
what happened on that field.

35
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:55,618
Hi.

36
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,379
Hi.

37
00:03:57,989 --> 00:03:59,727
I've tried everything,
but he won't stop.

38
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:00,631
Is he okay?

39
00:04:00,737 --> 00:04:04,469
If you can believe it, all his crying is a good sign.
The doctor said he's perfectly healthy.

40
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,247
I'm gonna go talk to the nurses,
find out if we can get some more formula.

41
00:04:08,294 --> 00:04:09,703
Clark, you take over.

42
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:10,948
- Me?
- Yeah.

43
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:12,674
Well, I, lana...

44
00:04:13,073 --> 00:04:14,738
I don't really...

45
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:22,610
Wow,

46
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,353
looks like someone has
the magic touch.

47
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:30,384
I'll be right back.

48
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:32,756
Uh...

49
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:35,786
when does child services
come and take him?

50
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:36,737
They're not.

51
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:38,824
They don't have room for him yet, so

52
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:40,973
he's going to stay
in the hospital until they do.

53
00:04:41,384 --> 00:04:43,168
Well, he can't stay in the hospital.

54
00:04:43,438 --> 00:04:44,448
I mean, he...

55
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:48,217
maybe he can come stay with us.

56
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,608
Until they find room for him.

57
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:06,204
I found an arrowhead
in evans field once,

58
00:05:06,228 --> 00:05:07,893
but never a baby in a crater.

59
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:09,173
It's really weird.

60
00:05:09,619 --> 00:05:12,907
But what's even weirder
is the way clark is with him.

61
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,537
Let me guess...
he's completely baby-phobic.

62
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,765
Actually, exactly the opposite.

63
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,162
You should see the look in his eyes
when he's holding that baby.

64
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:22,368
It's like he's completely at ease,

65
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:24,047
not to mention

66
00:05:24,094 --> 00:05:26,689
he's a natural born baby burper.

67
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,376
I've got the spit-up stains to prove it.

68
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:31,477
Sorry I'm late. I was up all night
with the crying machine

69
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:33,520
and every time I put him down,
he starts up again.

70
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,775
Well, if you need any help,
I could come over tonight.

71
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:38,767
Well, that would be great.
Could you pick up some formula on the way?

72
00:05:38,802 --> 00:05:40,528
Sure. How are youon diapers?

73
00:05:40,552 --> 00:05:42,083
The diapers... pretty good.

74
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:42,923
Okay,

75
00:05:42,987 --> 00:05:47,578
before you guys start picking out the schools...
for the little tyke, you might wanna hear this.

76
00:05:48,212 --> 00:05:51,397
I had my contact at emergency
services run a check of all

77
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:54,221
the 911 calls made around the time
that you found the baby.

78
00:05:54,257 --> 00:05:56,675
This one kinda stuck out.

79
00:05:57,378 --> 00:06:00,032
What the hell's the matter with you people?
It's an emergency!

80
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:02,650
It's too late!
It's coming! It's coming! Aah!

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,914
She sounds so scared.

82
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:07,215
No! No, don't leave me, please!

83
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:11,700
Did he just leave her there?

84
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:14,058
If he did, he might still be alive.

85
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:17,041
From the sounds of this,
the mother wasn't as lucky.

86
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:25,476
She didn't even get to see her own baby.

87
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:29,585
But the baby survived.
How is that possible?

88
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:31,681
Can you trace this call back
to the cell phone?

89
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:32,867
I can try.

90
00:06:33,336 --> 00:06:35,826
If this is the father, he might
have some answers for us.

91
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:47,412
Genevieve.

92
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:52,379
You know, I'm not accustomed
to being summoned like a lapdog.

93
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:55,514
Don't be silly, lionel.

94
00:06:55,902 --> 00:06:57,532
I'd never allow you on my lap.

95
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:03,572
So, uh, why am I here,
if not for the, uh,

96
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,748
pleasure of your company?

97
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:08,891
It's time to repay old debts, lionel.

98
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:14,466
Arranging your release from maximum
security prison was not an easy task.

99
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:19,410
And I have yet to receive
even a hint of gratitude.

100
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:24,742
Well, I've been racking my brain
trying to write a thank-you note, but, uh,

101
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:27,865
words could never express the way I feel.

102
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,006
Your son just returned from china
with a lost element.

103
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:36,472
And I would like you to retrieve it for me.

104
00:07:36,495 --> 00:07:38,688
No, no, you have the wrong son in mind.

105
00:07:38,735 --> 00:07:41,307
It was jason who brought
the stone back home.

106
00:07:41,565 --> 00:07:44,559
Jason's incapable of such subterfuge.

107
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,945
Unfortunately, he inherited his intelligence

108
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,164
from my husband's side of the family.

109
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,487
Yeah, I never thought you married well.

110
00:07:53,898 --> 00:07:55,636
Lex, on the other hand,

111
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,667
received his genes from a

112
00:07:57,721 --> 00:08:00,105
far more cunning source.

113
00:08:00,716 --> 00:08:03,839
You know, there were other treasure
seekers in china, genevieve.

114
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:05,152
Ha.

115
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:07,969
A farmboy,

116
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:10,165
an ex-cheerleader,

117
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,229
and lex luthor.

118
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:14,942
Who do you think ended up
with the prize?

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,787
Well,

120
00:08:16,222 --> 00:08:19,122
my son hasn't been
listening to me for years.

121
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,097
What do you want me to do,
give him a good spanking?

122
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:28,158
You know, lionel,

123
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:32,583
I don't think either one of us
want me to go after lex myself.

124
00:08:35,142 --> 00:08:36,845
You be careful, genevieve.

125
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:41,116
I regard a threat to any luthor
as a threat to me.

126
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,711
Interpret it any way you like.

127
00:08:45,613 --> 00:08:47,157
I want that stone,

128
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:48,872
lionel.

129
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:05,045
What's the matter?

130
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:07,479
What's the matter, little guy?
Is your milk too cold? Huh?

131
00:09:14,317 --> 00:09:15,224
Here, try this.

132
00:09:15,352 --> 00:09:17,334
Try this, try this, try this.

133
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:18,074
Huh?

134
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:19,143
Yeah?

135
00:09:19,366 --> 00:09:21,655
There you go.
There you go.

136
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,758
Clark, I could easily get
chelsea to cover for me

137
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:25,540
at the talon.
You don't have to stay home.

138
00:09:25,575 --> 00:09:27,375
That's okay.
I want to stay with him.

139
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,046
Okay.

140
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:30,800
It kind of changes your perspective

141
00:09:30,824 --> 00:09:32,595
when you have someone who
depends on you for everything.

142
00:09:32,642 --> 00:09:33,323
Yeah.

143
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,601
And I mean everything.

144
00:09:36,712 --> 00:09:38,075
Could you hand mea diaper?

145
00:09:38,096 --> 00:09:39,405
Here you go.

146
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:43,082
Well, listen, you have my number at the talon,
and your dad's out in the barn if you need him.

147
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:44,023
- Okay.
- Okay?

148
00:09:44,058 --> 00:09:45,303
Have fun.

149
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:45,949
Yeah.

150
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:50,985
Okay.

151
00:09:57,654 --> 00:10:00,818
Clark kent, changing diapers like a pro.

152
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:05,096
You know, all this baby stuff
is easier than people say.

153
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:07,139
I think I pretty much
got it under control.

154
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:10,062
Oh...

155
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:13,725
Nice aim, little guy.

156
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:16,179
Clark, we can't keep
calling him "little guy. "

157
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:18,557
They're gonna make fun of him
when he gets to high school.

158
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:19,816
Well, um...

159
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:22,599
we found him in evans field.

160
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:24,557
Why don't we call him evan?

161
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:27,352
I think he likes it.

162
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:29,618
Hello, evan.

163
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:32,072
This is clark, and I'm lana.

164
00:10:32,483 --> 00:10:35,778
And we think that you're
the most beautiful baby ever.

165
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,723
You know, lana, maybe weshould take a step back.

166
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:41,778
Step back from what?

167
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:45,674
Well, maybe we shouldn't
get so attached.

168
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,028
I mean, if his father's still alive...

169
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:53,280
then he never should've
left him in that field.

170
00:10:53,597 --> 00:10:55,194
Lana, we don't know what happened.

171
00:10:55,382 --> 00:10:57,695
He could've gone for help.
He could be looking for evan right now.

172
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,162
Or maybe he isn't.

173
00:11:00,758 --> 00:11:03,858
Maybe evan is an orphan,
just like we were.

174
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:08,578
Clark, things like this don't just happen.

175
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:12,288
There's a reason he survived
and that someone like you found him.

176
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:15,233
We found him.

177
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:22,266
Evan?

178
00:11:27,268 --> 00:11:28,971
Clark, what's happening?

179
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:36,453
Clark, wha...

180
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:44,132
my god.

181
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:02,759
What are you doing, son?

182
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:07,280
an exciting new venture,
something worthy of a captain of industry?

183
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:09,985
I'm simply continuing
where you left off, dad.

184
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:12,463
I, uh, can't talk now.

185
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:13,543
Well,

186
00:12:13,684 --> 00:12:14,987
we better talk.

187
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:19,069
Genevieve teague thinks
you have the missing element.

188
00:12:21,512 --> 00:12:22,839
The one from china.

189
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,655
Come on, dad.

190
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:29,748
You've raised me
to be smarter than that.

191
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:35,454
Why use genevieve teague as a threat?
Why not just come out and ask for it yourself?

192
00:12:35,818 --> 00:12:39,646
I'm here as a father who's concerned
about the safety of his son.

193
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:46,270
She had bridgette crosby murdered
because of one of those elements.

194
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:48,689
You think she'd hesitate
to do the same to you?

195
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,999
I don't have it.

196
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:57,856
And even if I did,
I'd never trust you.

197
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:01,179
Lex...

198
00:13:02,506 --> 00:13:05,463
we haven't a lot of time
left to spend together.

199
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,594
You can go on for the rest of your life
being mistrustful of me,

200
00:13:11,369 --> 00:13:13,969
or you can accept me
as your father

201
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:15,484
who loves you.

202
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:27,219
She's dangerous, lex.
She...

203
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:31,117
watch your back, son.

204
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:33,417
I always do.

205
00:13:48,736 --> 00:13:50,250
Where is evan now?

206
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:52,057
In the loft with lana.

207
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:55,121
And, mom, I've never seen anything like it.
Last night, he was just a baby.

208
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,082
His growth spurt was really amazing.

209
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,691
And frightening.

210
00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:00,802
Evan needs to be seen by a doctor.

211
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,962
We have to take him back
to the hospital.

212
00:14:02,998 --> 00:14:06,097
What are we gonna tell the doctors...
he's some second-generation meteor freak?

213
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:08,759
He'll either wind up in belle reve
or a laboratory for the rest of his life.

214
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:11,260
I don't know, clark, but we
owe it to him to do something.

215
00:14:11,883 --> 00:14:15,781
I was thinking we'd take him to someone who
has experience in the effects of meteor rock.

216
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:16,662
Clark,

217
00:14:17,071 --> 00:14:19,630
I realize that lex
has helped us in the past,

218
00:14:19,971 --> 00:14:23,200
but there's no way that I'm about to put
this young man's life in his hands.

219
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:24,491
If I were in trouble,

220
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:26,523
and lex was the only one
who could help,

221
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,116
what would you do?

222
00:14:34,691 --> 00:14:36,476
"You must be very kind to him,

223
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:39,608
to teach him all he needs
to know in rabbit land.

224
00:14:39,655 --> 00:14:42,579
For he is going to live with us
forever and ever. "

225
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:47,626
You know how to read?

226
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,254
I've read all of clark's books.
But this is my favorite.

227
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:53,579
I also liked the encyclopedia.

228
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,851
The encyclopedia, huh?
That's a pretty long book.

229
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:00,422
I know. I stopped on "W."

230
00:15:00,493 --> 00:15:03,393
Windmills. Did you know they
were invented in persia?

231
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,088
Why are you looking
at me like that?

232
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:10,262
Um...

233
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,018
you are a very,
very special boy, evan.

234
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:19,774
I think that you are the most special
little boy that I have ever met.

235
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:21,159
Really?

236
00:15:21,371 --> 00:15:22,216
Yeah.

237
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,177
And you're really lucky,

238
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,394
because there are so many more
books for you to read

239
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:29,606
and so many places
for you to see.

240
00:15:29,653 --> 00:15:30,769
Like what?

241
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:32,518
Like a real windmill.

242
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:37,309
And when you stand up on top of it,
the whole world stretches out around you.

243
00:15:37,661 --> 00:15:40,007
Can we go right now?

244
00:15:40,535 --> 00:15:41,604
Where are you going?

245
00:15:43,104 --> 00:15:44,067
Dad!

246
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,261
Mom's taking me to see a real windmill.
Wanna come?

247
00:15:47,554 --> 00:15:48,341
Um...

248
00:15:49,703 --> 00:15:50,501
evan...

249
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:53,331
listen...

250
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:57,604
we're not your real parents.

251
00:15:58,062 --> 00:16:00,458
Everyone's supposed to have
a mother and father.

252
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:03,945
And they're supposed to love each other
very much, just like you and lana.

253
00:16:09,764 --> 00:16:12,218
Clark and I care
about you a lot, evan.

254
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:13,613
That's what matters.

255
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:15,914
If you're not my mom and dad,

256
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,591
where are they?

257
00:16:21,656 --> 00:16:23,239
We don't know, but...

258
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:24,894
wherever they are,

259
00:16:25,775 --> 00:16:28,041
I'm sure they love you very much.

260
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:34,018
You wanna go for a ride in the truck?

261
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:35,885
Are we going to the windmill?

262
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:40,077
Uh... we will, but first, I want to
take you to meet a friend of mine.

263
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:09,407
I hope I've done the right thing.

264
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:14,902
Clark, he looks really scared.

265
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,570
I just hope it'll be over soon.

266
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:20,717
Lex has his top scientists trying
to figure out what's happening.

267
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,639
And they've already come up
with some intriguing discoveries.

268
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,868
Lex, is he gonna be all right?

269
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,202
Tell us what's happening.

270
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:33,417
Well, the results are only
preliminary, but...

271
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:36,869
the data indicates that
evan's body is storing energy,

272
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:38,593
like a battery charging.

273
00:17:38,628 --> 00:17:40,202
Charging for what?

274
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:44,358
The theory we're working on is that
once enough energy is stored, it's

275
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:47,664
expended to fuel a burst
of rapid cell division.

276
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,494
That's how he was able to go from
a baby to a 7-year-old in one day.

277
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,068
Is there any way to stop it?

278
00:17:52,302 --> 00:17:54,827
My team believes a bone marrow
transplant might slow the growth

279
00:17:54,862 --> 00:17:56,823
and bring his metabolism
back to normal.

280
00:17:56,893 --> 00:17:58,664
Can we use my bone marrow?

281
00:17:58,734 --> 00:18:00,613
We're willing to do
anything to help.

282
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:03,748
Well, it's not that simple.

283
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:06,425
His genetic makeup is highly unusual.

284
00:18:06,828 --> 00:18:10,492
For this to work, we'll need an exact match
with a living donor, which means

285
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:12,100
a biological parent.

286
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:15,341
Well, we think his mother died
when he was born.

287
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:17,159
We're still trying to find his father.

288
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:20,986
What's going to happen
to evan if we can't?

289
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:32,504
Evan!

290
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:36,399
Evan.

291
00:18:40,568 --> 00:18:41,836
Unbelievable.

292
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,354
What's wrong with me?

293
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:51,778
Prep the level 3 facility.
I want him transferred immediately.

294
00:18:51,802 --> 00:18:53,692
No. You're not
taking him anywhere.

295
00:18:54,115 --> 00:18:56,602
Clark, we need to isolate him
while we run more tests.

296
00:18:56,907 --> 00:18:58,187
I just want to go home.

297
00:18:58,222 --> 00:18:59,937
Lex, he's just a boy.

298
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:02,787
We understand you're trying to help,
and we appreciate it.

299
00:19:02,846 --> 00:19:05,276
He's been through enough.
We're taking him home.

300
00:19:25,394 --> 00:19:26,779
I'm dying, aren't I?

301
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:29,445
Evan, don't say that.

302
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:33,511
I- I read the average

303
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:35,951
life span of a man is 74 years.

304
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:40,671
I've aged from a newborn
to a teenager

305
00:19:40,832 --> 00:19:42,101
in 48 hours.

306
00:19:45,036 --> 00:19:46,058
Do the math.

307
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:48,171
Evan, we're not gonna give up.

308
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,806
Lex has got his team working
on a cure right now.

309
00:19:50,853 --> 00:19:52,145
And if we can find your father...

310
00:19:52,178 --> 00:19:54,585
do you really think they're gonna
find a cure for me overnight?

311
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,418
It's like my life was just some sort
of trick that was played on me.

312
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:05,857
All that stuff I read in the books
that I thought I was gonna see...

313
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,299
I'm not...

314
00:20:12,362 --> 00:20:13,182
am I?

315
00:20:13,851 --> 00:20:15,506
Don't talk like that, all right?

316
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:17,373
We just have to keep trying.

317
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:21,013
It's not fair.

318
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:27,110
This whole thing... it's just not fair!

319
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:36,397
Clark, we have to do something.
We can't just let this happen to him.

320
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:39,579
Would you go see if he's okay?

321
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:42,656
I need to find his father.

322
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:02,108
So our friendly phone
company just got friendlier.

323
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:05,346
I was able to trace the 911
call back to a cell phone.

324
00:21:05,382 --> 00:21:08,646
His mother was karen gallagher.
She was a senior here.

325
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:11,429
I remember hearing about her.
Was she wall of weird material?

326
00:21:11,476 --> 00:21:15,033
I got a couple blips on the radar
when I heard that she...

327
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:18,109
had a knack for shorting monitors when
ever she walked into the computer lab,

328
00:21:18,156 --> 00:21:21,684
but I had no idea that super-fast pregnancy
powers was part of the equation.

329
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:23,069
How long was she pregnant for?

330
00:21:24,044 --> 00:21:27,379
Well, last weekend, christina varrano
had a party at her house,

331
00:21:27,414 --> 00:21:32,239
and karen apparently went nc-17
with some guy in the bedroom.

332
00:21:32,356 --> 00:21:34,258
Christina has no idea
who the guy was.

333
00:21:34,282 --> 00:21:37,276
So she got pregnant and
delivered a baby a week later?

334
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:42,738
We need to find evan's father.

335
00:21:45,215 --> 00:21:46,202
Okay.

336
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:48,127
Well,

337
00:21:48,796 --> 00:21:51,661
christina used e-vite
to send out all her invitations.

338
00:21:51,694 --> 00:21:54,277
I guess ours got lost
in the electronic mail.

339
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:57,424
Let's just check all the rsvp
sand try to track him down.

340
00:22:05,714 --> 00:22:08,379
Excuse me. Does tanner
sutherland work here?

341
00:22:08,591 --> 00:22:09,869
Yeah, he's over there.

342
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:12,722
Thank you.

343
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:15,810
Tanner?

344
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:18,170
Leave your car around
back, I'll get to it.

345
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:23,917
Hey, were you at christina
varrano's party last week?

346
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,260
Uh, I don't remember.

347
00:22:32,014 --> 00:22:33,388
I think I was working.

348
00:22:34,926 --> 00:22:36,852
So you didn't hook up
with karen gallagher?

349
00:22:38,238 --> 00:22:39,553
What do you want?

350
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,382
Who the hell are you?

351
00:22:41,511 --> 00:22:43,202
I'm the guy who found your son,

352
00:22:44,024 --> 00:22:45,645
laying in the middle of a field.

353
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,014
Look, dude, I don't have a son, and...

354
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:50,867
I don't know what you're
talking about, all right?

355
00:22:50,914 --> 00:22:52,382
I got work to do.

356
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:55,352
I'm not going to let you walk away from this.
You have a responsibility.

357
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:57,337
Get off me, man.
What's your problem?

358
00:22:57,395 --> 00:22:59,579
My problem is your son needs your help.

359
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,793
Now tell me how he got
on that field.

360
00:23:09,006 --> 00:23:10,530
I got with this girl

361
00:23:10,718 --> 00:23:11,739
at a party.

362
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,743
The next day, she calls me up, crying,

363
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:18,115
saying she's... she's pregnant.

364
00:23:20,284 --> 00:23:22,550
I go over, and her stomach...

365
00:23:22,585 --> 00:23:24,041
it was already...

366
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,656
a week later, we were in my car,

367
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:32,441
we're speeding to the hospital

368
00:23:32,476 --> 00:23:35,822
and she's screaming, "it's coming!"
And she starts glowing.

369
00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:38,594
And then the car it went
up like a freakin' a-bomb.

370
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,255
That wasn't a baby.

371
00:23:43,995 --> 00:23:45,756
It was some kind of monster.

372
00:23:47,318 --> 00:23:49,373
He's a human being, tanner,

373
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,134
and he's your son.

374
00:23:51,251 --> 00:23:52,651
He's aging rapidly.

375
00:23:53,485 --> 00:23:54,753
He needs your help.

376
00:23:55,528 --> 00:23:57,935
He needs a bone marrow transplant.
You're the only one who can help him.

377
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:58,851
What?

378
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,260
No.

379
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,489
Look, I can't deal with this.

380
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,274
I'm sorry.

381
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,718
I can't.

382
00:24:19,463 --> 00:24:21,482
How could someone do
that to their own son?

383
00:24:21,518 --> 00:24:22,210
Clark,

384
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:25,078
being a father is an
enormous responsibility.

385
00:24:25,113 --> 00:24:26,745
The kid is just too young
to handle it.

386
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:29,986
He's evan's only hope, and evan's going
to die if we can't convince him to help.

387
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:32,405
I know that, son, and we're
gonna figure it out.

388
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,444
But what's more important right now
is what are we gonna tell evan?

389
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:37,910
Maybe it's best I don't even
tell him I found his father.

390
00:24:38,191 --> 00:24:40,082
He's gonna take it pretty hard.

391
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:41,056
Son,

392
00:24:41,303 --> 00:24:43,919
an orphaned child has every right
to know about his origins.

393
00:24:43,954 --> 00:24:46,115
You should know that
better than anybody.

394
00:24:46,643 --> 00:24:47,794
I'll tell you what...

395
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:50,283
I'll talk to him, okay?
I mean, I do have a little

396
00:24:50,318 --> 00:24:52,080
experience in that department.

397
00:24:52,112 --> 00:24:53,979
Thanks, dad, but I think I should tell him.

398
00:24:54,003 --> 00:24:55,071
Tell him what?

399
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,781
Did you find my father?

400
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:02,668
Clark, where is he?

401
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:07,136
He works downtown...

402
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,540
at massey's auto garage.
His name's tanner sutherland.

403
00:25:12,808 --> 00:25:14,136
When can I see him?

404
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,872
Look, evan, um,

405
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:19,303
sometimes, when you

406
00:25:19,631 --> 00:25:22,943
meet your biological father,
it can be painful.

407
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,462
Why?

408
00:25:26,411 --> 00:25:27,632
I don't understand.

409
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:32,800
They don't always live up
to your expectations, evan.

410
00:25:33,128 --> 00:25:34,444
Trust me, I know.

411
00:25:34,937 --> 00:25:36,264
But I want to see him.

412
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:38,119
Evan, we're just
trying to protect you.

413
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:39,716
You can't protect me.

414
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:40,970
No one can.

415
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:42,191
Just calm down, okay?

416
00:25:42,214 --> 00:25:44,070
Stop telling me what to do, clark.

417
00:25:45,162 --> 00:25:46,641
You're not my father.

418
00:25:48,802 --> 00:25:50,140
- Evan!
- Clark.

419
00:25:59,264 --> 00:26:01,340
Is there any possibility of an error?

420
00:26:01,505 --> 00:26:03,665
We've run the projections three times.

421
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:05,157
Lex,

422
00:26:05,461 --> 00:26:06,836
I found evan's father.

423
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:08,740
Where is he?

424
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:11,201
He's here in smallville,
but he doesn't want to help.

425
00:26:11,248 --> 00:26:14,465
I've just been informed that evan's cell
division is increasing exponentially,

426
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,307
along with the energy
he expels when he ages.

427
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,264
We have only a few hours
to stabilize evan.

428
00:26:20,452 --> 00:26:24,550
According to the projections, evan is building
towards a massive chronological event.

429
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:27,016
You're saying evan's about to die?

430
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:29,092
It's a lot worse than that.

431
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:34,011
The next time evan ages, he'll release enough
energy to kill himself and anyone else at hand.

432
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:45,754
Good night.

433
00:26:52,448 --> 00:26:55,101
We're closed.
Come back tomorrow.

434
00:27:00,197 --> 00:27:01,853
Are you deaf?

435
00:27:02,335 --> 00:27:03,814
What are you staring at?

436
00:27:04,413 --> 00:27:05,670
My father.

437
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,912
Don't call me that.

438
00:27:07,948 --> 00:27:09,310
I'm not your dad.

439
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:10,540
Yes, you are.

440
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,217
Why won't you admit it?

441
00:27:13,252 --> 00:27:14,908
You stay the hell away from me.

442
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,280
Please, dad. Just help me.

443
00:27:17,582 --> 00:27:18,674
I'm your son.

444
00:27:18,698 --> 00:27:19,995
No, you're not!

445
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:22,185
You're some kind of freak!

446
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:37,556
Dad?

447
00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:44,836
Dad?

448
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,184
Dad.

449
00:27:51,476 --> 00:27:52,356
Oh, my god

450
00:27:54,082 --> 00:27:55,139
what have I done?

451
00:28:01,611 --> 00:28:03,619
Okay, dad, call me if you find him.

452
00:28:04,218 --> 00:28:05,157
What happened?

453
00:28:05,204 --> 00:28:06,461
Evan's gone.

454
00:28:06,543 --> 00:28:08,009
He must've snuck out.

455
00:28:08,056 --> 00:28:11,061
My parents are looking for him, and lana's
at the farm in case he comes back.

456
00:28:11,096 --> 00:28:13,644
Well, let's make sure we can
help him when he turns up.

457
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:15,054
Lex.

458
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:23,037
He's dead.

459
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:28,732
Evan.

460
00:28:29,553 --> 00:28:33,111
Clark, we needed a living donor
to stop evan from aging again.

461
00:28:35,107 --> 00:28:37,233
There's gotta be something else
we can do to help him.

462
00:28:39,837 --> 00:28:40,917
There is.

463
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:46,295
We need to track him down and seal him
in a containment chamber under luthorcorp.

464
00:28:47,752 --> 00:28:48,891
No. Lex...

465
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:52,085
it's the only way to contain
the blast from his final change.

466
00:28:54,257 --> 00:28:56,112
Lex, I'm not gonna let him just die.

467
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:58,934
Nothing can stop that
from happening now, clark.

468
00:29:00,425 --> 00:29:01,482
Look, I'm sorry,

469
00:29:01,517 --> 00:29:04,793
but if we don't isolate evan, a lot of
innocent people are going to be killed.

470
00:29:20,932 --> 00:29:22,611
He hasn't come back, mr. Kent.

471
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:25,405
Let me know if you find him.

472
00:29:31,842 --> 00:29:34,448
Ok. Evan, I have been worried
sick about you.

473
00:29:34,483 --> 00:29:36,538
We've been looking for you all night.

474
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:41,966
Are you okay?

475
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:44,056
I don't know.

476
00:29:45,324 --> 00:29:46,991
I did something bad.

477
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:50,960
Evan, tell me what happened.

478
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,796
It was an accident...

479
00:29:58,262 --> 00:29:59,448
a mistake.

480
00:30:00,928 --> 00:30:03,039
We all make mistakes.

481
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,505
It's part of what makes us human.

482
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:08,746
What happened?

483
00:30:13,428 --> 00:30:14,637
Are you all right?

484
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:17,983
It's happening again.

485
00:30:18,852 --> 00:30:19,921
I can feel it.

486
00:30:20,614 --> 00:30:23,908
I'm gonna call clark, and we're
gonna get you help, okay?

487
00:30:31,775 --> 00:30:32,738
It's coming.

488
00:30:33,243 --> 00:30:34,581
I can feel it.

489
00:30:35,027 --> 00:30:37,611
There has to be something
that we can do.

490
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:41,380
There is.

491
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:45,521
The windmill that you told me about,

492
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:46,589
remember?

493
00:30:47,728 --> 00:30:50,135
Where the whole world
stretches out around you.

494
00:30:54,163 --> 00:30:55,396
I'd like to see it.

495
00:30:55,807 --> 00:30:57,091
Just once.

496
00:31:00,707 --> 00:31:02,351
Please, lana, hurry.

497
00:31:09,144 --> 00:31:09,931
Chloe,

498
00:31:09,966 --> 00:31:11,364
has evan been here?

499
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:15,321
No. I mean, at the rate he's aging,
I'm not even sure I'd recognize him.

500
00:31:15,356 --> 00:31:18,385
He must be with lana. I keep trying
to call her, but all I get is static.

501
00:31:18,547 --> 00:31:22,117
Maybe he's putting off
an energy field like his mom was.

502
00:31:22,352 --> 00:31:23,949
That would explain the power surges.

503
00:31:23,984 --> 00:31:24,888
Power surges?

504
00:31:24,912 --> 00:31:27,683
Yeah, they've been popping up
all over town for the last hour.

505
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,726
Looks, they're happening all over.

506
00:31:31,969 --> 00:31:32,944
What's this?

507
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:36,100
It's the dwp grid. See,
these are the affected areas.

508
00:31:36,135 --> 00:31:37,603
Where's the most recent one?

509
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:38,589
Um...

510
00:31:40,586 --> 00:31:42,124
10 miles west

511
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,461
on the outskirts of town
in the middle of nowhere.

512
00:31:44,484 --> 00:31:46,351
Why would lana and evan
be way out there?

513
00:31:46,387 --> 00:31:47,338
The windmill.

514
00:31:47,807 --> 00:31:49,392
The one at chandler field?

515
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,099
Go get 'em, speedy.

516
00:32:01,162 --> 00:32:02,125
You were right.

517
00:32:02,641 --> 00:32:04,705
The whole world is right there.

518
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:11,973
It's beautiful.

519
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,341
I'm glad you finally got
a chance to see it.

520
00:32:30,729 --> 00:32:32,326
Lana, you have to go.

521
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:34,733
No, clark, we have to help him.

522
00:32:34,768 --> 00:32:36,494
There's no time.
You have to go now.

523
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,514
Clark...

524
00:32:38,312 --> 00:32:39,310
go.

525
00:32:48,756 --> 00:32:50,118
It's okay. I'm here.

526
00:32:50,717 --> 00:32:52,103
I'm sorry for what I said.

527
00:32:52,232 --> 00:32:54,227
It's okay, I know.
It's all right.

528
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:56,599
I'm glad it was you
and lana that found me.

529
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,687
I think you found us.

530
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:01,459
What's happening?

531
00:33:01,518 --> 00:33:03,397
I can feel it.
You better go.

532
00:33:03,444 --> 00:33:04,230
No.

533
00:33:04,324 --> 00:33:05,945
Evan, I'm not leaving you.

534
00:33:08,047 --> 00:33:10,054
I wish you had been
my father, clark.

535
00:33:15,251 --> 00:33:16,097
Evan.

536
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:17,776
Evan.

537
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:38,730
Clark!

538
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:40,186
Clark!

539
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,763
Clark,

540
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:50,961
are you all right?

541
00:33:51,581 --> 00:33:53,588
I got clear just before...

542
00:33:54,305 --> 00:33:55,361
where's evan?

543
00:33:59,922 --> 00:34:00,896
He's gone.

544
00:34:37,405 --> 00:34:39,213
I can't believe he's gone.

545
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,559
I know. Me too.

546
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:47,406
This whole year, I've felt...

547
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:49,566
so disconnected.

548
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:53,682
But when evan came into my life,

549
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:58,613
it was like I finally knew
where I belonged.

550
00:35:00,254 --> 00:35:01,887
I had a purpose.

551
00:35:01,922 --> 00:35:03,800
He only lived for a short time,

552
00:35:05,444 --> 00:35:08,858
but it seems like evan's affected us
like we've known him our whole lives.

553
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:16,506
Clark, we think we have
all the time in the world,

554
00:35:16,529 --> 00:35:19,547
that we're going to live forever,
but it's not true.

555
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:24,066
I guess we should make
the most of the time we have

556
00:35:25,909 --> 00:35:27,424
before it's too late.

557
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:40,875
This was his favorite book.

558
00:35:42,484 --> 00:35:43,259
Really?

559
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:44,433
Yeah.

560
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:48,272
It was my favorite book
when I was a kid.

561
00:35:52,312 --> 00:35:53,099
I, um,

562
00:35:54,226 --> 00:35:56,598
I used to pretend
that I was the rabbit.

563
00:35:57,573 --> 00:36:01,084
I was just like him, and my parents had
brought me to life with their love.

564
00:36:05,225 --> 00:36:08,970
My only hope is that
evan felt that way about us.

565
00:36:29,524 --> 00:36:32,084
It's a 1961 bordeaux.

566
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:35,510
I am honored.

567
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:39,608
Well, I assume your visit
means I have...

568
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:41,440
cause to celebrate.

569
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:44,714
Don't all my visits deserve
to be celebrated, genevieve?

570
00:36:46,393 --> 00:36:48,718
Some more than others.

571
00:36:50,413 --> 00:36:51,274
Mmm...

572
00:36:52,781 --> 00:36:54,319
do you have something for me?

573
00:36:55,458 --> 00:36:57,290
I most certainly do.

574
00:36:59,368 --> 00:37:01,505
To the resolution of our problem.

575
00:37:01,904 --> 00:37:02,644
Hmm...

576
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:10,520
parenthood...

577
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:13,068
it's an interesting
phenomen on, isn't it?

578
00:37:15,956 --> 00:37:19,703
The lengths we go to...
to protect our children.

579
00:37:25,656 --> 00:37:26,830
No limits.

580
00:37:28,278 --> 00:37:30,016
What are you...

581
00:37:38,247 --> 00:37:41,558
The wine you've just drunk
will kill you in a matter of minutes.

582
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:46,396
I'm told that the pain
will be excruciating.

583
00:37:49,345 --> 00:37:50,778
How about a trade?

584
00:37:51,557 --> 00:37:55,373
You give me the stone that you
stole from bridgette crosby,

585
00:37:55,937 --> 00:37:57,487
and I give you...

586
00:37:59,457 --> 00:38:00,808
the antidote.

587
00:38:01,935 --> 00:38:03,391
One more thing...

588
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:07,031
you go near my son,

589
00:38:07,242 --> 00:38:10,881
and anything that happens
to him happens to you.

590
00:38:13,006 --> 00:38:14,392
Is that understood?

591
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:20,553
The element, genevieve.

592
00:38:21,715 --> 00:38:22,819
Where is it?

593
00:38:49,356 --> 00:38:51,549
You did everything you could, clark.

594
00:38:54,684 --> 00:38:56,575
I'm sure evan knew that.

595
00:39:01,783 --> 00:39:04,741
All the times that
I've run off or disappeared

596
00:39:05,974 --> 00:39:08,640
or almost died, how do you
guys deal with that?

597
00:39:10,874 --> 00:39:14,420
It isn't easy, clark, but
it does come with the territory.

598
00:39:16,675 --> 00:39:19,599
You see, every parent's greatest fear
is that one day they...

599
00:39:19,636 --> 00:39:21,655
will lose their child forever.

600
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:28,184
It seems like raising a kid
is the toughest job in the world.

601
00:39:28,548 --> 00:39:30,976
It's also the most rewarding.

602
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:34,144
There is nothing quite like

603
00:39:35,107 --> 00:39:36,715
watching your son

604
00:39:37,972 --> 00:39:40,930
grow up into a young man
you can be very proud of.

605
00:39:46,733 --> 00:39:48,788
It's too bad I'll never know
what that's like.

606
00:39:50,409 --> 00:39:51,336
Why not?

607
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,789
I'm from another planet.

608
00:39:57,597 --> 00:40:00,462
I'm not even human.
Who knows if I can have kids?

609
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:04,053
Clark, your father and
I couldn't have children.

610
00:40:05,462 --> 00:40:07,587
We were still blessed with a son.

611
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:13,271
You never know what
the future will bring you.

612
00:40:32,674 --> 00:40:33,660
Clark.

613
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:37,276
Lana told me you straightened
things out with child services.

614
00:40:37,957 --> 00:40:39,202
I appreciate it.

615
00:40:39,777 --> 00:40:42,047
Well, I know you grew
pretty tight with him.

616
00:40:43,256 --> 00:40:46,297
I promise you, evan's life wasn't in vain.

617
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:47,835
What do you mean?

618
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:53,260
Well, my team believes studying his unique
cellular structure could advance research on

619
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:57,062
cancer and age-related
diseases by hundreds of years.

620
00:40:58,353 --> 00:41:02,557
I'm releasing our findings to every
research facility across the globe.

621
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:06,114
Evan's life may offer hope
for generations to come.

622
00:41:09,472 --> 00:41:11,397
He was a special kid, lex.

623
00:41:14,157 --> 00:41:16,874
I can't help wondering what
kind of man he would've become.

624
00:41:17,813 --> 00:41:18,940
A good one...

625
00:41:19,868 --> 00:41:21,747
as long as you were in his life.

626
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,128
I bet you're gonna be
a great dad someday, clark.

627
00:41:29,723 --> 00:41:31,202
So will you, lex.

628
00:41:32,235 --> 00:41:33,809
I don't know about that.

629
00:41:35,323 --> 00:41:38,198
Look, we're all reflections
of how we've been raised.

630
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,640
Your parents gave you
encouragement and support.

631
00:41:40,687 --> 00:41:42,519
My chose the opposite track.

632
00:41:43,411 --> 00:41:46,238
I plan on leaving
a different kind of legacy.

633
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:51,839
Well, I better get back to work.

634
00:41:54,366 --> 00:41:55,434
Thanks, lex.

635
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:08,801
Mr. Luthor...

636
00:42:09,575 --> 00:42:11,701
are you sure you want
to release the findings?

637
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:14,904
Eventually...

638
00:42:21,204 --> 00:42:25,204
