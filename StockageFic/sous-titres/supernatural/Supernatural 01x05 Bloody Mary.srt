1
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,050
Okay, your turn. Truth or dare?

2
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,080
Truth.

3
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,650
Do you want to make out with benji swartz?

4
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,510
Dare.

5
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,150
Okay, lame.

6
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,160
You have to...

7
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,890
say "bloody mary" in the bathroom.

8
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,380
Is that the best you can come up with?

9
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,830
Who's bloody mary?

10
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,580
She's this witch.

11
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,760
I heard she was a lady killed in a car crash.

12
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,540
It doesn't matter who she is.

13
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,560
If you say her name three times
in the bathroom mirror,

14
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,410
she appears...

15
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,330
and scratches your eyes out!

16
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,680
So why would anyone say it?

17
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,780
Because it isn't real.

18
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,410
No turning on the lights.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,920
And remember,

20
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,890
three times.

21
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,530
Bloody mary.

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,490
This is so stupid.

23
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,230
Bloody mary.

24
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,460
Bloody mary.

25
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,350
Scared you.

26
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,600
You guys are jerks.

27
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,520
Lily?

28
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,170
You mind keeping it down?

29
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:38,960
Sorry, daddy.

30
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,720
Sorry, mr. Shoemaker.

31
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,800
You so like him!

32
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,380
Hey, geek.

33
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,910
You guys having fun?

34
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,460
You're out past curfew.

35
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,960
Thanks, dad.

36
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,270
Why Sam ?

37
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:09,760
No!

38
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,750
- Why Sam?
- Sam, wake up.

39
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,010
I take it I was having a nightmare?

40
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,300
Yeah, another one.

41
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,190
Hey, at least I got some sleep.

42
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,520
Hey, you know, sooner or later,
we're gonna talk about this.

43
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,120
Are we here?

44
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,890
Yep. Welcome to Toledo, Ohio.

45
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,440
So, what do you think
really happened to this guy?

46
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,020
So what we're gonna find out.

47
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,240
Let's go.

48
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:17,740
Hey.

49
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,030
Hey.

50
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,110
Can I help you?

51
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,710
Yeah, we're the... med students.

52
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,740
Sorry?

53
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:25,960
Oh, doctor...

54
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,110
Fliglavitch didn't tell you?

55
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,980
We talked to him
on the phone.

56
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,300
We're from Ohio state.

57
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,550
He's supposed to show us
the shoemaker corpse.

58
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,290
It's for our paper.

59
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,260
Well, I'm sorry, he's at lunch.

60
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,050
Oh.

61
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,220
Well, he said, uh

62
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,610
oh, well, you know, it doesn't matter.

63
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,980
You don't mind showing us
the body, do you?

64
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,200
Sorry, I can't.

65
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,560
Doc will be back in an hour.
You can wait for him,

66
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,280
if you want.

67
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,170
An hour?

68
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,140
We got to be heading back
to columbus.

69
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,810
Yeah.

70
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,060
Look man, this paper's half our grade,

71
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,800
- So if you don't mind helping us out?
- Look, man

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,720
No.

73
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,810
I'm gonna hit him
in his face, I swear.

74
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,210
Follow me.

75
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,450
Dude, I earned that money.

76
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,040
You won it in a poker game.

77
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,010
Yeah.

78
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,540
The newspaper said his daughter found him.

79
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,420
She said his eyes were bleeding.

80
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,520
More than that.

81
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,140
They practically liquefied.

82
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,710
Any sign of a struggle,
maybe somebody did it to him?

83
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,530
Nope.

84
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,560
Besides the daughter, he was all alone.

85
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,930
What's the official causeof death?

86
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,970
Doc's not sure.
He's thinking massive stroke,

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,520
maybe an aneurysm.

88
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,750
Something burst up in there, that's for sure.

89
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,150
What do you mean?

90
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,350
Intense cerebral bleeding.

91
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,030
This guy had more blooding his skull
than anyone I've ever seen.

92
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,870
But the eyes?

93
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,590
What would cause something like that?

94
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,290
Capillaries can burst.

95
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,240
See a lot of bloodshot eyes
with stroke victims.

96
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,630
Yeah, you ever see exploding eyeballs?

97
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,480
That's a first for me.

98
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,190
But, hey, I'm not the doctor.

99
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,670
Think we could take a look atthat police report?

100
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,370
You know, for our paper?

101
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,450
I'm not really supposed to show you

102
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,850
Might not be one of ours.

103
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,840
Might just be some freak medical thing.

104
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,700
How many times in dad's long

105
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,730
and varied career has it actually been
a freak medical thing

106
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,830
and not some sign
of an awful supernatural death?

107
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,850
Uh, almost never.

108
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,990
Exactly.

109
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,940
All right.

110
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,690
Let's go talk to the daughter.

111
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,090
Feel like we're underdressed.

112
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,070
You must be Donna,right?

113
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:07,830
Yeah.

114
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,670
Hi, uh... We're really sorry.

115
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,270
Thank you.

116
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,640
I'm sam.This is dean.

117
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,720
We worked with your dad.

118
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:19,770
You did?

119
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,280
Yeah.This whole thing

120
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,180
I mean, a stroke.

121
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,590
I don't think she really wants
to talk about this right now.

122
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,830
It's okay, I'm okay.

123
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,770
Were there ever any symptoms?

124
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,130
Dizziness, migraines?

125
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,000
No.

126
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,050
That's because it wasn't a stroke.

127
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,240
Lily, don't say that.

128
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,160
What?

129
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,370
I'm sorry, she's just upset.

130
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,300
No, it happened because of me.

131
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,580
Sweetie, it didn't.

132
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,430
Lily,

133
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,080
why would you saysomething like that?

134
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,540
Right before he died,I said it.

135
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,010
You said what?

136
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,130
Bloody Mary, three times
in the bathroom mirror.

137
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,030
She took his eyes, that's what she does.

138
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,420
That's not why dad died.This isn't your fault.

139
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,600
I think your sister's right,lily.

140
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,490
There's no way it could
have been Bloody Mary.

141
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,660
Your dad didn't say it,did he?

142
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,750
No, I don't think so.

143
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,460
Sam:The Bloody Mary legend

144
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,630
dad ever find any evidence
that it was a real thing?

145
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,620
Not that I know of.

146
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,440
I mean,

147
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,980
everywhere else,

148
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,950
all over the country,
kids will play Bloody Mary.

149
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,120
And as far as we know, nobody dies from it.

150
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,880
Hey well, maybe everywhere
it's just a story,

151
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,460
but here it's actually happening.

152
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,090
The place where the legend began?

153
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,520
But according to the legend,
the person who says...

154
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,110
the person who says you know what gets it

155
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:13,700
But here...

156
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,210
Shoemaker gets it instead,yeah.

157
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:15,840
Right.

158
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,570
Never heard anything like that before.

159
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,740
Still, the guy did die
right in front of the mirror.

160
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,060
And the daughter's right.
The way the legend goes,

161
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,510
"you know who" scratches your eyes out.

162
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,970
It's worth checking into.

163
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,880
What are you doingup here?

164
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:37,910
We...

165
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,810
we had to go to the bathroom.

166
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,710
Who are you?

167
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,140
Like we said downstairs,
we worked with Donna's dad.

168
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,910
He was a day trader or something,
he worked by himself.

169
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,640
No, I know, I meant...

170
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,780
and those weird questions downstairs,

171
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,730
what was that?

172
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,510
So you tell me what's going on

173
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,200
or I start screaming.

174
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,520
All right, all right.

175
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,750
We think something happened to Donna's dad.

176
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,910
Yeah, a stroke.

177
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,990
That's not the sign of a typical stroke.

178
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,730
We think it might be something else.

179
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,170
Like what?

180
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,730
Honestly,

181
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
we don't know yet.

182
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,990
But we don't want it
to happen to anyone else.

183
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,240
That's the truth.

184
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:22,760
So,

185
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,430
if you're gonna scream,

186
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,300
go right ahead.

187
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,770
Who are you, cops?

188
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,070
Something like that.

189
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,150
I'll tell you what.

190
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,030
Here.

191
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,660
If you think of anything,

192
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,610
you or your friends notice anything strange,

193
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,090
out of the ordinary, just give us a call.

194
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,280
All right, say Bloody Mary really is haunting this town.

195
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,230
There's gonna be some sort of proof

196
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,670
a local woman who died nasty.

197
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,640
Yeah, but a legend
this wide spread, it's hard.

198
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,910
I mean, there's like 50 versions
of who she actually is.

199
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,030
One story says she's a witch,

200
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,130
another says she's a mutilated bride.

201
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,210
There's a lot more.

202
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,890
What are we supposed to be looking for?

203
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,770
Every version's got thingsin common.

204
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,960
It's always a woman named Mary,

205
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,010
and she always dies in front of a mirror.

206
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,150
So we've got to search local newspapers

207
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,020
public records as far back as they go,

208
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,920
see if we can find a Mary who fits the bill.

209
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,590
Well, that sounds annoying.

210
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,320
No, it won't be so bad,

211
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,320
as long as we...

212
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,060
I take it back.

213
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,090
This will be very annoying.

214
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,070
I'm not sure. They were cops
or detectives or something.

215
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,180
Whoever they were, they were cute.

216
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,010
Jill.

217
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,050
You didn't think so?

218
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,020
Yeah, okay,they were cute. But,

219
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,620
still,do you think something
could have happenedto Donna's dad?

220
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,090
Maybe Lily was right.

221
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,450
Maybe Bloody Mary got him.

222
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,330
Very funny.

223
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,280
Wait, I'm sorry.

224
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,100
Was that fear I hear in your voice?

225
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,430
No.

226
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,500
Charlie...

227
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,510
I'm walking to the bathroom mirror right now.

228
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,480
Jill, quit it.

229
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
Oh, no,

230
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,660
I can't help myself.

231
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,730
I'm gonna say it.

232
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,710
Bloody Mary.

233
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,830
Bloody Mary.

234
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,640
Bloody Mary.

235
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,720
Jill?

236
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,220
Jill!

237
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,680
You're such a freak.
I'll call you tomorrow.

238
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,440
You did it.

239
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,600
You killed that boy.

240
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,820
Why Sam?

241
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,930
Why'd you let me fall asleep?

242
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,060
'Cause I'm an awesome brother.

243
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,530
So, what did you dream about?

244
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,030
Lollipops and candy canes.

245
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,720
Yeah, sure.

246
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,130
You find anything?

247
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,720
Oh, besides a whole new level of frustration?

248
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,220
No. I've looked at everything.

249
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,990
A few local women, a Laura and a Catherine,

250
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,770
committed suicide in front of a mirror,

251
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,150
and a giant mirror fell on a guy named dave.

252
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,090
But, uh...

253
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,940
No Mary.

254
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,710
Maybe we just haven't found it yet.

255
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,960
I've also been searching for strange deaths,

256
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,560
in the area, you know,

257
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,510
eyeball bleeding, that sort of thing.

258
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,620
There's nothing.

259
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,330
Whatever's happening here,
maybe it just ain't Mary.

260
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,280
Hello?

261
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,170
And they found her on the bathroom floor.

262
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,150
And her-her eyes...

263
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,050
they were gone.

264
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,710
I'm sorry.

265
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,010
And she said it.

266
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,240
I heard her say it.

267
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,340
But it couldn't be because of that.

268
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,670
I'm insane, right?

269
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,560
No, you're not insane.

270
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,240
God, that makes me feel so much worse.

271
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:33,940
Look...

272
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,780
we think something's happening here,

273
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,510
something that can't be explained.

274
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,600
And we're gonna stop it,

275
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,800
but we could use your help.

276
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,130
What did you tell Jill's mom?

277
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,710
I just said I needed some time alone
with Jill's pictures and things.

278
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,410
Great.

279
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,100
I hate lying to her.

280
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,050
This is for the greater good.

281
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,040
Hit the lights.

282
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,560
What are you guys looking for?

283
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,760
We'll let you know as soon as we find it.

284
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,090
Hey, night vision.

285
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,490
Thanks. Perfect.

286
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,920
Do I look like Paris Hilton?

287
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,840
So, I don't get it.

288
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,200
I mean, the first victim didn't summon Mary,

289
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,800
and the second victim did.

290
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,370
How's she choosing them?

291
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,590
Beats me.

292
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,910
I want to know
why Jill said it in the first place.

293
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,030
It's just a joke.

294
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,150
Somebody's gonna say it again.
It's just a matter of time.

295
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,030
Hey.

296
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,780
There's a black light in the trunk, right?

297
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,300
Gary Bryman?

298
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,070
You know who that is?

299
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,040
No.

300
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,630
So, Gary Bryman was an 8 year-old boy.

301
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,530
Two years ago,
he was killed in a hit and run.

302
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,340
The car was described
as a black toyota camry,

303
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,290
but nobody got the plates or saw the driver.

304
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,410
Oh, my god.

305
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:06,920
What?

306
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,710
Jill drove that car.

307
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,490
We need to get back
to your friend Donna's house.

308
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,690
Linda shoemaker.

309
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,390
Why are you asking me this?

310
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,690
Look, we're sorry, but it's important.

311
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,380
Yeah.

312
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,110
Linda's my mom, okay?

313
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,260
And she overdosed on sleeping pills.

314
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,000
It was an accident, and that's it.

315
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,130
I think you should leave.

316
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,870
- Donna, just listen
- Get out of my house!

317
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:48,910
Oh, my god.

318
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,690
Do you really think her dad
could have killed her mom?

319
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,920
Maybe.

320
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,840
I think I should stick around.

321
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,000
All right. Whatever you do, don't...

322
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,420
Believe me, I won't say it.

323
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,290
Wait, wait, wait.

324
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,470
You're doing a nationwide search?

325
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,210
Yep.

326
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,960
The NCIC, the FBI database

327
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,240
any mary in the country who died
in front of a mirror is good enough for me.

328
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,510
But if she's haunting the town,
she should have died in the town.

329
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,490
I'm telling you. There's nothing local.
I check. So, unless you've gota better idea.

330
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,850
Why Mary's choosing a victim?
It seems like there's a pattern.

331
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,050
I know I was thinking the same thing.

332
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,060
With mr. Shoemaker and Jill's hit and run

333
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,560
both had secrets where people died.

334
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,100
Right.

335
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,510
There's a lot of folklore about mirrors

336
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,440
that they reveal or your lies,
or your secrets,

337
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,490
that they're a true reflection of your soul,

338
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,880
which is why it's bad luck to break them.

339
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,790
Right. Right.

340
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,960
Yeah, so maybe if you've got a secret,

341
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,750
I mean, like a really nasty one
where someone died,

342
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,060
then mary sees it and punishes you for it.

343
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,830
Whether you summoned her or not.

344
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,630
Take a look at this.

345
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,440
Looks like the same handprint.

346
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,530
Her name was Mary Worthington

347
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,480
an unsolved murder in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

348
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,300
I was on the job for 35 years,

349
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,780
detective for most of that.

350
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,790
Now, everybody packs it in
with a few loose ends,

351
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,740
but the Mary Worthington murder...

352
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,860
that one still gets me.

353
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,220
What exactly happened?

354
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,290
You boys said you were reporters.

355
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,150
We know Mary was 19,

356
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,350
lived by herself.

357
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,220
We know she won a few beauty contests,

358
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,690
dreamt of getting out of Indiana,

359
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,110
being an actress.

360
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,560
And we know, the night of march 29th,

361
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,390
someone broke into her apartment

362
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,340
and murdered her,

363
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,390
cut out her eyeswith a knife.

364
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:41,900
That's right.

365
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,120
See, sir, when we ask you what happened,
we want to know what

366
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,240
you think happened.

367
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,580
Technically, I'm not supposed
to have a copy of this.

368
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,090
Now,

369
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,660
see that there,

370
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,030
"t-r-e"?

371
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,110
Yeah.

372
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,410
I think Mary was trying
to spell out the name of her killer.

373
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,440
You know who it was?

374
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:10,830
Not for sure.

375
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,610
But there was a local man,

376
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,540
a surgeon,

377
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,070
Trevor Sampson.

378
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,550
And I think he cut her up good.

379
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,990
Now, why would he do something like that?

380
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,620
Her diary mentioned a man she was seeing.

381
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,160
She called him by his initial, "T."

382
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,610
Well,

383
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,880
her last entry,

384
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,100
she was gonna tell
to his wife about their affair.

385
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,340
But how do you know it was Sampson who killed her?

386
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,210
It's hard to say.

387
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,580
But the way her eyes were cut out,
it was almost professional.

388
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,240
But you could never prove it?

389
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:44,860
No.

390
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,120
No prints,

391
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,360
no witnesses.

392
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,300
He was meticulous.

393
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,040
Is he still alive?

394
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,380
Nope.

395
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,170
If you ask me,

396
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,420
Mary spent her last living moments

397
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,100
trying to expose this guy's secret.

398
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,330
But she never could.

399
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,340
Where's she buried?

400
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,620
She wasn't.

401
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,820
She was cremated.

402
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,700
What about that mirror?  It's not
in evidence lockup somewhere, is it?

403
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,170
No.

404
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,860
It was returned to Mary's family
a long time ago.

405
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,450
You have the names
of her family by any chance?

406
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,430
I mean, you bring
these strangers into my house,

407
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,940
and they ask me things like that?

408
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,240
They were only trying to help.

409
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,330
Please, Donna, you have to believe me.

410
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,240
What? About bloody mary?

411
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,530
Please, I know it sounds crazy.

412
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,730
"Crazy" doesn't even begin to cover it.

413
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,030
I mean, it's one thing
for my sister to believe this crap.

414
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,900
She's 12. But you?

415
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,330
Think about the way

416
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,970
your dad died,

417
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,400
okay, and the way Jill died.

418
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,200
Okay, so...

419
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:01,850
Bloody Mary.

420
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,230
No!

421
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,110
Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary.

422
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,800
See? Nothing happened.

423
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,470
Why would you do that?

424
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,950
Oh, my god,

425
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,480
there really is something wrong with you.

426
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,830
Elements that lose electrons become

427
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,260
positive ions,

428
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,790
which are smaller than other
atoms of the same element.

429
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,730
Therefore, the ionic radius

430
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,090
is smaller than the atomic radius

431
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,950
Charlie!

432
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,350
Charlie!

433
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,940
Charlie, stop it! What's wrong?
Just calm down!

434
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,190
- Charlie!
- Aah! Let me go!

435
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,040
Charlie!

436
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:06,970
Oh, really?

437
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,460
Ah, that's too bad, Mr. Worthington.

438
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,700
I would have paid a lot for that mirror.

439
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,930
Okay, well, maybe next time.

440
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,270
All right, thanks.

441
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,100
So?

442
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,090
So, that was Mary's brother.

443
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,500
The mirror was in the family for years,

444
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,840
until he sold it

445
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,150
one week ago

446
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,110
to a store called estate antiques,

447
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,040
a store in Toledo.

448
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,790
So wherever the mirror goes,
that's where Mary goes?

449
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,340
Her spirit's definitely
tied up with it somehow.

450
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,350
Isn't there an old superstition
that says mirrors can capture spirits?

451
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,040
Yeah, there is.
When someone would die in a house,

452
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,470
people would cover up the mirrors
so the ghost wouldn't get trapped.

453
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,120
This Mary dies in front of the mirror,
and it draws in her spirit.

454
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,280
Yeah, but how could she move
through 100 different mirrors?

455
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,260
I don't know but if the mirror is the source,

456
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,770
I say we find it and smash it.

457
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,550
Yeah, I don't know. Maybe.

458
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,230
Hello?

459
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,320
Charlie?

460
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,390
Hey.

461
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,280
Hey. It's okay.

462
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,690
You can open up your eyes, Charlie.

463
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,420
It's okay, all right?

464
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,510
Now, listen.

465
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,430
You're gonna stay right here

466
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:32,780
on this bed.

467
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,740
You're not gonna look at glass

468
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,830
or anything else that has a reflection, okay?

469
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,750
as long as you do that

470
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,920
she cannot get you.

471
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,610
But I can't keep that up forever.

472
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,790
I'm gonna die, aren't I?

473
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,210
No.

474
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,380
No.

475
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,250
Not anytime soon.

476
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,370
All right, Charlie,

477
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,040
we need to know what happened.

478
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,250
We were in the bathroom.

479
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,350
Donna said it.

480
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,880
That's not what we're talking about.

481
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,710
Something happened, didn't it,

482
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,060
in your life.

483
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,590
A secret...

484
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,010
where someone got hurt?

485
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,020
Can you tell us about it?

486
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,100
I had this boyfriend.

487
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,820
I loved him.

488
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,760
But he kind of scared me, too, you know?

489
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,580
And...

490
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,700
one night

491
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,340
at his house,

492
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,760
we got in this fight.

493
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,420
Then I broke up with him,

494
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,690
and he got upset and he said

495
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,220
he needed me and he loved me.

496
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,570
And he said...

497
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,390
"charlie, if you walk out that door
right now, I'm gonna kill myself."

498
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,530
And you know what I said?

499
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,320
I said, "go ahead."

500
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,400
And I left.

501
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,760
How could I say that?

502
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,650
How could I leave him like that?

503
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,680
I just...

504
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,280
I didn't believe him, you know?

505
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,040
I should have.

506
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,720
Her boyfriend killing himself,
that's not really Charlie's fault.

507
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,670
You know as well as I do,

508
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,340
spirits don't exactly see shades of gray,

509
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,150
Dean.

510
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,660
Charlie had a secret,

511
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,880
someone died.

512
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,530
That's good enough for Mary.

513
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,230
I guess.

514
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,030
You know,I've been thinking,

515
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,550
it might not be enough
to just smash that mirror.

516
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,140
Why, what do you mean?

517
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,660
Mary's hard to pin down, right?

518
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,360
And she moves around from mirror to mirror.

519
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,260
So, who's to say that she's not gonna
just keep hiding in them forever?

520
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,790
So maybe...

521
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,470
we should try to pin her down,

522
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,670
you know, summon her to her mirror

523
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,640
and then smash it.

524
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,590
Well, how do you know that's gonna work?

525
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,400
I don't,

526
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,230
I'm not for sure.

527
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,060
Well, who's gonnasummon her?

528
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,520
I will.

529
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,780
She'll come after me.

530
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,460
All right, you know what? That's it.

531
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,650
This is about Jessica, isn't it?

532
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,960
You think that's your dirty little secret,

533
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,740
that you killed her somehow?

534
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,790
Sam, this has got to stop, man.

535
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,150
I mean,

536
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,820
the nightmares and-and

537
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,880
calling her name out
in the middle of the night,

538
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,950
it's gonna kill you.

539
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,260
Now, listen to me.

540
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,040
It wasn't your fault.

541
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:21,160
If you want to blame something,
then blame the thing that killed her.

542
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,050
Or, hell, why don't you take a swing at me?

543
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,490
I'm the one that dragged you
away from her the first place.

544
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,810
I don't blame you.

545
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,590
You shouldn't blame yourself,

546
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,560
because there's nothingyou could've done.

547
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,340
- I could've warned her.
- About what?!

548
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,710
You didn't know what was gonna happen.

549
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,170
And, besides,

550
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,350
all of this isn't a secret.
I mean, I know all about it.

551
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,830
It's not gonna work with Mary anyway.

552
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,110
No, you don't.

553
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,100
I don't what?

554
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,360
You don't know all about it.

555
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,410
I haven't told you everything.

556
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,540
What are you talking about?

557
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,410
It wouldn't really be a secret
if I told you, would it?

558
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,100
No.

559
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
I don't like it.

560
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,990
It's not gonna happen. Forget it.

561
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,810
Dean, that girl back there is going to die

562
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,580
unless we do something about it.

563
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,100
And you know what?

564
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,270
Who knows how many more people
are gonna die after that?

565
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,730
Now, we're doing this.

566
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,570
You've got to let me do this.

567
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,340
Well, that's just great.

568
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,320
All right, let's start looking.

569
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,300
Maybe they've already sold it.

570
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,900
I don't think so.

571
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,050
That's it.

572
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,160
You sure about this?

573
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,400
Bloody Mary.

574
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,420
Bloody Mary.

575
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,430
Bloody Mary.

576
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,640
I'll go check that out. Stay here. Be careful.

577
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,510
Smash anything that moves.

578
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,310
Crap.

579
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,340
hold on

580
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,070
Whoa, guys, false alarm.

581
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,670
I tripped the system.

582
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,660
Who are you?

583
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,360
I'm the boss's kid.

584
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,440
You're Mr. Yamashiro's kid?

585
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,640
Come on.

586
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:55,900
Come into this one.

587
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,850
It's your fault.

588
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,310
You killed her.

589
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,170
You killed Jessica.

590
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,410
Like I said, I was adopted.

591
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:33,920
Yeah.

592
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,530
You know, I just

593
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,270
I really don't have timefor this right now.

594
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,420
You never told her the truth,

595
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,260
who you really were.

596
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,620
But it's more than that,isn't it?

597
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,090
Those nightmares you've been having

598
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,950
of jessica dying,

599
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,320
screaming,

600
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,020
burning

601
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,900
you had them for days before she died.

602
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,850
Didn't you?!

603
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,160
You were so desperateto ignore them,

604
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,840
to believethey were just dreams.

605
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,900
How could you ignore them like that?

606
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,930
How could you leave her alone to die?

607
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,300
You dreamt it would happen!

608
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,520
Dude.

609
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,470
Sammy, sammy!

610
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,150
It's sam.

611
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,030
God, are you okay?

612
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,080
Uh, yeah.

613
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,920
Come on, come on.

614
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,980
You killed them!

615
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,060
All those people!

616
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,540
You killed them!

617
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,970
Hey, sam?

618
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,640
Yeah?

619
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:20,030
That's got to be like what,
600 years of bad luck?

620
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,900
So this is really over?

621
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,680
Yeah, it's over.

622
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,660
Thank you.

623
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,010
Charlie?

624
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,260
Your boyfriend's death,

625
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,180
you really should try to forgive yourself.

626
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,920
No matter what you did,

627
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,560
you probably couldn't have stopped it.

628
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,450
Sometimes bad things just happen.

629
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,690
That's good advice.

630
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,470
hey, sam?

631
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,120
Yeah?

632
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,580
Now that this is all over,

633
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,210
I want you to tell me what that secret is.

634
00:39:58,990 --> 00:39:59,880
Look...

635
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,330
You're my brother.

636
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,940
And I'd die for you.

637
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,480
But there are some things
I need to keep to myself.
