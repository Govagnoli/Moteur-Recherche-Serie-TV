1
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,160
You boys really screwed up this time.

2
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,520
Where is he?

3
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,350
You're never gonna see your father again.

4
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,070
They've got dad.

5
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,010
Meg?

6
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,050
- What did she say?
- I just told you, Sammy.

7
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,110
Okay.

8
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,150
Okay.

9
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,710
What are you doing,
Dean?

10
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,850
We got to go.

11
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,340
Why?

12
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,570
Because the demon
knows we're in Salvation, alright?

13
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,760
It knows we've got the colt.

14
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,440
It gots dad.
It's probably coming for us next.

15
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,670
Good. We've still got three bullets left.

16
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,960
Listen, tough guy, we're not ready.

17
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,710
Okay? We don't know
how many of them are out there.

18
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,310
Look, we're no good to anybody dead.

19
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,490
We're leaving... now.

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,710
I'm telling you, Dean,
we could've taken him.

21
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,880
All we need is a plan.

22
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,400
They're probably keeping dad alive.
We just have to figure out where.

23
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,970
They're gonna want to trade him
for the gun.

24
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,010
- What?
- Dean, if that were true,

25
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,000
why didn't Meg mention a trade?

26
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,330
Dad...

27
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,170
- He might be...
- Don't!

28
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,820
I don't want to believe it
any more than you,

29
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,720
but if he is...

30
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,560
All the more
reason to kill this damn thing.

31
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
We still have the colt.
We can still finish the job.

32
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,350
Screw the job, Sam!

33
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,250
Dean, I'm just trying to do
what he would want.

34
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,820
He would have wanted us to keep going.

35
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,690
Quit talking about him like
he's dead already!

36
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,870
Listen to me.

37
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,190
Everything stops until we get him back.
You understand me?

38
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,200
Everything.

39
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,770
So, how do we find him?

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,040
Maybe we go to Lincoln.

41
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,620
Start at the warehouse
where he was taken.

42
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,280
Come on, Dean. You really think these demons
are gonna leave a trail?

43
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,830
You're right.

44
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,620
We need help.

45
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,430
Here you go.

46
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,230
What is this... holy water?

47
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,480
That one is.
This is whiskey.

48
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,580
Bobby, thanks.
Thanks for everything.

49
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,980
To tell you the truth,
I wasn't sure if we should come.

50
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,740
Nonsense. Your daddy needs help.

51
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,900
Yeah, but the last time we saw you,

52
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,030
you did threaten
to blast him full of buckshot.

53
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,780
You cocked the shotgun and everything.

54
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,340
Yeah, well, what can I say?

55
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,500
John just has that effect on people.

56
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,740
Yeah, I guess he does.

57
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,250
None of that matters now.

58
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,820
All that matters
is that you get him back.

59
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,560
Bobby, this book...

60
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,070
- I've never seen anything like it.
- "Key of Solomon"?

61
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,570
It's the real deal, all right.

62
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,520
And these uh... these protective circles,
they really work?

63
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,470
Hell yeah!

64
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,280
You get a demon in one,

65
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,930
they're trapped.
Powerless.

66
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,010
It's like a satanic roach motel.

67
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,630
The man knows his stuff.

68
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,120
I'll tell you something else, too.

69
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,200
This is some serious crap
you boys stepped in.

70
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,240
Oh, yeah?

71
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,870
- How's that?
- Normal year, I hear of

72
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,030
say, three demonic possessions,
maybe four, tops.

73
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,740
- Yeah?
- This year, I heard of 27 so far.

74
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,850
You get what I'm saying?

75
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,580
More and more demons are
walking among us.

76
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,100
- A lot more.
- Do you know why?

77
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,800
No, but I know it's something big.

78
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,680
The storm's coming,

79
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,910
and you boys, your daddy...

80
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,980
you are smack in the middle of it.

81
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,740
Rumsfeld.

82
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,760
What is it?

83
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,290
Something's wrong.

84
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,610
No more crap, okay?

85
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,590
I want the colt, Sam.

86
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,570
The real colt.

87
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,760
Right now.

88
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,050
We don't have it on us.
We buried it.

89
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,980
Didn't I say "no more crap"?

90
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,000
I swear... After everything I heard
about you Winchesters,

91
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,300
I've got to tell you,
I'm a little underwhelmed.

92
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,380
First Johnny tries to pawn off a fake gun,

93
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,530
and then he leaves the real gun
with you two chuckleheads.

94
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,550
Lackluster, men.

95
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,450
I mean, did you really think

96
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,650
I wouldn't find you?

97
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:32,980
A ctually,

98
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,420
we were counting on it.

99
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,460
Gotcha.

100
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,810
You know,

101
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,090
if you wanted to tie me up,

102
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,680
all you had to do was ask.

103
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,900
I salted the doors and windows.

104
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,100
If there are any demons out there,
they ain't getting in.

105
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,810
Where's our father, Meg?

106
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,470
You didn't ask very nice.

107
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,990
Where's our father, bitch?

108
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,640
Jeez. You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

109
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,070
Oh, I forgot. You don't.

110
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,760
You think this is a freaking game?!

111
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,270
Where is he?!
What did you do to him?!

112
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,760
He died screaming.

113
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,070
I killed him myself.

114
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,530
That's kind of a turn-on...

115
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,170
You hitting a girl.

116
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,370
You're no girl.

117
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,780
Dean,

118
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,600
- you okay?
- She's lying. He's not dead.

119
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,580
Dean, you've got to be careful with her.
Don't hurt her.

120
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,810
- Why?
- Because she really is a girl.

121
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,680
- That's why.
- What are you talking about?

122
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,920
She's possessed.

123
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,840
That's a human possessed by a demon.
Can't you tell?

124
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,860
Are you trying to tell me there's an
innocent girl trapped somewhere in there?

125
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,200
That's actually good news.

126
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,410
Are you gonna read me a story?

127
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,860
Something like that.

128
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,660
Hit it, Sam.

129
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,700
"regna terrae,

130
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,920
cantáTe deo,
psáLlite dóMino"...

131
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,210
An exorcism?

132
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,110
Are you serious?

133
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,790
We're going for it, baby...
Head spinning,

134
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,320
projectile vomiting,
the whole nine yards.

135
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,170
"tribuite virtutem deo".

136
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,450
I'm gonna kill you.

137
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,900
I'm gonna rip the bones
from your body.

138
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,920
No, you're gonna burn in Hell.

139
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,840
Unless you tell us where our dad is.

140
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,990
Well, at least you'll get a nice tan.

141
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,140
"exorcizamus te,
omnis immundus spiritus,

142
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,290

"omnis congregatio

145
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He begged for his life
with tears in his eyes.

146
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,490
He begged to see his sons
one last time.

147
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,570
That's when I slit his throat.

148
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,050
"ergo"...

149
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,870
For your sake,

150
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,020
I hope you're lying.

151
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,020
'cause if it's true,
I swear to god,

152
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,910
I will march into Hell myself,

153
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,450
and I will slaughter each and every one

154
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,060
of you evil sons of bitches,
so help me God.

155

Where is he?

163
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,500
You just won't take "dead"
for an answer, will you?

164
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,460
- Where is he?!
- Dead!

165
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,090
No, he's not!

166
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,970
He's not dead!
He can't be!

167
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,640
What are you looking at?
Keep reading.

168

He will be!

Wait! What?!

175
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,340
He's not dead,

176
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,500
but he will be
after what we do to him.

177
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,540
How do we know
you're telling the truth?

178
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,640
You don't.

179
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,030
- Sam!
- A building!

180
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,460
Okay?

181
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,230
- A building in Jefferson city.
- Missouri?

182
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,080
- Where, where? An address.
- I don't know.

183
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,130
And the demon, the one we're looking for,
where is it?

184
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,770
I don't know. I swear.

185
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,150
That's everything.
That's all I know.

186
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,760
Finish it.

187
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,520
What? I told you the truth.

188
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,640
I don't care.

189
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,410
You son of a bitch.
You promised.

190
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,410
I lied!

191
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,840
Sam?

192
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
Sam!

193
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,790
Read.

194
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,280
We can still use her,

195
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,660
find out where the demon is.

196
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,260
- She doesn't know.
- She lied.

197
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,000
Sam, there's an innocent girl trapped
somewhere in there.

198
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,120
We've got to help her.

199
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,520
You're gonna kill her.

200
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,510
What?

201
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,540
You said
she fell from a building.

202
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,270
That girl's body is broken.

203
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,390
The only thing keeping her alive
is that demon inside.

204
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,390
You exorcise it,
the girl is gonna die.

205
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,690
Listen to me, both of you,
we're not gonna leave her like that.

206
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,810
She is a human being.

207
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,180
And we're gonna put her
out of her misery.

208
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,010
Sam, finish it.

209
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,360
Finish it.

210
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,350
"dominicos
sanctae ecclesiae.

211
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,960
"terogamus audi nos.

212
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,660
"terribilis deus
de sanctuario suo deus israhel

213
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,680
"ipse tribuite virtutem
et fortitudinem plebi suae.

214
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,270
benedictus deus.
gloria patri".

215
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,960
She's still alive.

216
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,610
Call 911.
Get some water and blankets.

217
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,520
Thank you.

218
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,930
Shh, shh, just take it easy,
all right?

219
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,560
Come on. Let's get her down.

220
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,590
Sorry, sorry.

221
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,480
I've got you.
I've got you.

222
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,840
It's okay. It's okay.

223
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,990
A year.

224
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,360
What?

225
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,660
It's been a year.

226
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,170
Shh, shh, just take it easy.

227
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,950
I've been awake for some of it.

228
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,290
I couldn't move my own body.

229
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,110
The things I did...

230
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,950
It's a nightmare.

231
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,830
Was it telling us the truth
about our dad?

232
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,950
- Dean.
- We need to know.

233
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,260
Yes.

234
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,770
But it wants... you to know

235
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,220
that... They want you
to come for him.

236
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,090
If dad's still alive,
none of that matters.

237
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,060
Where is the demon
we're looking for?

238
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,840
Not there.

239
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,580
Other ones.

240
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,370
Awful ones.

241
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,350
Where are they keeping our dad?

242
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,450
By the r-river.

243
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,340
Sunrise.

244
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,420
"Sunrise"?
What does that mean?

245
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,190
What does that mean?

246
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,070
You better hurry up and beat it

247
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,160
before the paramedics get here.

248
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,570
What are you gonna tell them?

249
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,440
You think you guys
invented lying to the cops?!

250
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,750
I'll figure something out.

251
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,990
Here. Take this.
You might need it.

252
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,940
Thanks.

253
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,110
Thanks... for everything.

254
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,690
Be careful, all right?

255
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,040
Just go find your dad.

256
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,220
And when you do,
you bring him around, would you?

257
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,730
I won't even try to shoot him this time.

258
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,020
You've been quiet.

259
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,720
Just getting ready.

260
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,140
He's gonna be fine, Dean.

261
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,550
Dude, what are you drawing
on my car?

262
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,070
It's called a devil's trap.

263
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,810
Demons can't get through it
or inside it.

264
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,660
So?

265
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,990
It basically turns the trunk
into a lockbox.

266
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,720
So?

267
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,000
So we have a place to hide the colt
while we go get dad.

268
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,420
What are you talking about?
We're bringing the colt with us.

269
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,390
We can't, Dean.

270
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,050
We've only got three bullets left.

271
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,360
We can't just use them on any demon.
We've got to use them on the demon.

272
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,080
No, we have to save dad, Sam, okay?

273
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,390
We're gonna need
all the help we can get.

274
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,910
You know how pissed dad would be
if we used all the bullets?

275
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,220
Dean, he wouldn't want us to bring the gun.

276
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,770
I don't care, Sam!
I don't care what dad wants, okay?

277
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,290
And since when do you care
what dad wants?

278
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,670
We want to kill this demon.

279
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,430
You used to want that, too!

280
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,910
Hell, you're the one who came
and got me at school!

281
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,450
You're the one
who dragged me into this.

282
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,100
I'm just trying to finish it.

283
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,070
Well, you and dad are a lot more alike
than I thought. You know that?

284
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,730
You both can't wait to sacrifice yourself
for this thing.

285
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,130
But you know what? I'm gonna be
the one to bury you.

286
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,970
You're selfish, you know that?

287
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,160
You don't care about anything
but revenge.

288
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,050
That's not true, Dean.

289
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,690
I want dad back,

290
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,780
but they are expecting us
to bring this gun.

291
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,030
They get the gun,
they will kill us all.

292
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,750
That colt is our only leverage,
and you know it, Dean.

293
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,950
We cannot bring that gun.

294
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,740
We can't.

295
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,410
Fine.

296
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,410
- I'm serious, Dean.
- I said "fine," Sam.

297
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,060
Hey, hey.

298
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,510
I think I know
what Meg meant by "sunrise".

299
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,210
Son of a bitch.
That's pretty smart.

300
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,100
If these demons can possess people,

301
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,990
they can possess almost anybody inside.

302
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,980
Yeah, and make anybody attack us.

303
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,860
And so we can't kill 'em...
A building full of human shields.

304
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,810
They probably know
exactly what we look like, too,

305
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,510
and they could look like anybody.

306
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,470
- This sucks out loud.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

307
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,810
All right.

308
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,660
So, how the hell
are we gonna get in?

309
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,000
Pull the fire alarm,

310
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,750
- get out all the civilians.
- Okay,

311
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,290
but then the city responds in...

312
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,170
- what, seven minutes?
- Seven minutes, exactly.

313
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,160
Hey, what's happening?
Is it a fire?

314
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,730
We're figuring that out right now, sir.
Just stay back.

315
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,400
I got a yorkie upstairs,
and he pees when he's nervous.

316
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,910
Sir, you have to stay back.

317
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,040
I always wanted to be a fireman
when I grew up.

318
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,990
You never told me that.

319
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,550
This is the fire department.
We need you to evacuate.

320
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,310
Hurry up!

321
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,180
Dad.

322
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,790
He's still breathing.

323
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,310
Dad, wake up.

324
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,750
Dad!

325
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,530
- Wait. Wait.
- What?

326
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,560
He could be possessed,
for all we know.

327
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,380
What, are you nuts?

328
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,490
Dean, we got to be sure.

329
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,640
Sam?

330
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,910
Why are you splashing water on me?

331
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,920
Dad, are you okay?

332
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,660
They've been drugging me.

333
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,020
- Where's the colt?
- Don't worry, dad,

334
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,870
it's safe.

335
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,870
Good, boys. Good, boys.

336
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,040
Hey, buddy,
You can't go in.

337
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,910
Go!

338
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,750
Back, back!

339
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,600
Go!

340
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,700
Sam, let's go!

341
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,630
Sam!

342
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,250
Sam, come on.
Come on.

343
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,360
Come on.

344
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,070
Come on,
we've got to get out of here.

345
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,350
How is he?

346
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,930
He just needed a little rest,
that's all.

347
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,110
How are you?

348
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,150
I'll survive.

349
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,000
Hey, you don't think
we were followed here, do you?

350
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,440
I don't know.

351
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,860
I don't think so. I mean,

352
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,090
we couldn't have found
a more out-of-the-way place to hole up.

353
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,560
Yeah.

354
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,300
Hey, uh...

355
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,820
Dean, you, um...

356
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,940
You saved my life back there.

357
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,770
So I guess you're glad
I brought the gun, huh?

358
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,580
Man, I'm trying to thank you here.

359
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,580
You're welcome.

360
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,820
Hey, Sam?

361
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,000
Yeah?

362
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,120
You know that guy I shot?

363
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,600
There was a person in there.

364
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,890
You didn't have a choice,
Dean.

365
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,170
Yeah, I know.
That's not what bothers me.

366
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,350
Then what does?

367
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,560
Killing that guy, killing Meg.

368
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,250
I didn't hesitate.
I didn't even flinch.

369
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,920
For you or dad, the things I'm willing
to do or kill, it's just...

370
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,620
This scares me sometimes.

371
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,650
It shouldn't.

372
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,610
You did good.

373
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,440
You're not mad?

374
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,920
For what?

375
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,410
Using a bullet.

376
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,630
Mad?

377
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,300
I'm proud of you.

378
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
You know, Sam and I,

379
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,040
we can get pretty obsessed.

380
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,010
But you...
You watch out for this family.

381
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,280
You always have.

382
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,780
Thanks.

383
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,100
- It found us. It's here.
- The demon?

384
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,470
Sam, lines of salt in front of
every window, every door.

385
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,760
Already did it.

386
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,640
- Check it, okay?
- Okay.

387
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,410
- Dean, you got the gun?
- Yeah.

388
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,650
- Give it to me.
- Sam tried to shoot the demon in Salvation.

389
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,740
- It vanished.
- It's me. I won't miss.

390
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,570
Now, the gun. Hurry.

391
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,590
Son, please.

392
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,550
Give me the gun.
What are you doing, Dean?

393
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,910
He'd be furious.

394
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,880
What?

395
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,230
That I wasted a bullet.

396
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,100
He wouldn't be proud of me.
He'd tear me a new one.

397
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,690
You're not my dad.

398
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,550
Dean, it's me.

399
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,500
I know my dad better than anyone,

400
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,160
and you ain't him.

401
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,490
- What the hell has gotten into you?
- I could ask you the same thing.

402
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,900
Stay back.

403
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,700
Dean?
What the hell is going on?

404
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,860
Your brother's lost his mind.

405
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,670
- He's not dad.
- What?

406
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,030
I think he's possessed.

407
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,970
I think he's been possessed
since we rescued him.

408
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,290
- Don't listen to him, Sammy.
- Dean, how do you know?

409
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,620
He's different.

410
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:24,960
You know, we don't have time
for this.

411
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,430
Sam, if you want to kill this demon,

412
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,320
you've got to trust me.

413
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,840
Sam?

414
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,380
No.

415
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,180
No.

416
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,870
Fine.

417
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,970
You're both so sure.

418
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,540
Go ahead.

419
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,680
Kill me.

420
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,810
I thought so.

421
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,400
What a pain in the ass
this thing's been.

422
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,120
It's you, isn't it?

423
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,370
We've been looking for you
for a long time.

424
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,060
Well, you found me.

425
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,940
But the holy water?

426
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,980
You think something like that works
on something like me?

427
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,060
I'm gonna kill you!

428
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,440
Oh, that would be a neat trick.

429
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,230
In fact,

430
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,250
here.

431
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:11,980
Make the gun float to you there,
psychic boy.

432
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,740
Well, this is fun.

433
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:26,480
I could've killed you a hundred times
today, but this...

434
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,120
This is worth the wait.

435
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,070
Your dad...

436
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,790
He's in here with me,

437
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,540
trapped inside his own meat suit.

438
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,170
He says "hi," by the way.

439
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,490
He's gonna tear you apart.

440
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,940
He's gonna taste the iron
in your blood.

441
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,690
- Let him go, or I swear to god...
- What?

442
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,770
What are you and god gonna do?

443
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,690
You see, as far as I'm concerned,

444
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,020
this is justice.

445
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,310
You know that little exorcism of yours?

446
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,510
That was my daughter.

447
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,080
- Who, Meg?
- The one in the alley?

448
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,890
That was my boy.

449
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,560
You understand?

450
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,160
- You've got to be kidding me.
- What?

451
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:27,140
You're the only one that can have a family?

452
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,530
You destroyed my children.

453
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,970
How would you feel if I killed your family?

454
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:41,370
Oh, that's right.

455
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,110
I forgot. I did.

456
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,990
Still,

457
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,090
two wrongs don't make a right.

458
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,220
You son of a bitch.

459
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,400
I want to know why.

460
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,390
Why did you do it?

461
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,410
You mean why did I kill
mommy and pretty little Jess?

462
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,520
Yeah.

463
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,080
You know, I never told you this,
but

464
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,710
Sam was gonna ask her
to marry him.

465
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,520
Been shopping for rings
and everything.

466
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,580
You want to know why?

467
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,350
- Because they got in the way.
- In the way of what?

468
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,320
My plans for you, Sammy...

469
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,690
You...

470
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,380
And all the children like you.

471
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,740
Listen,

472
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,160
you mind just getting this over with, huh?

473
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,040
'cause I really can't stand the monologuing.

474
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,810
Funny,

475
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,570
but that's all part of your m.o.,
isn't it?

476
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,320
Mask all that nasty pain,

477
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,580
mask the truth.

478
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,990
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

479
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,160
You know, you fight, and you fight for
this family, but the truth is

480
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,120
they don't need you.

481
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,510
Not like you need them.

482
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,640
Sam...

483
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,120
he's clearly John's favorite.

484
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,430
Even when they fight,

485
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:00,400
it's more concern
than he's ever shown you.

486
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,720
I bet you're real proud of your kids,
too, huh?

487
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,120
Oh, wait, I forgot.

488
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,070
I wasted 'em.

489
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,860
Dean!

490
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,120
No!

491
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,220
Dad!

492
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,390
Dad, don't you let it kill me!

493
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,310
Dean!

494
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,370
Dad, please.

495
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,780
Dean!

496
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,250
No!

497
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,760
Stop.

498
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,780
Stop it.

499
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,490
You kill me,

500
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,240
you kill daddy.

501
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,950
I know.

502
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,180
Dean? Dean? Hey.

503
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,940
Oh, god,
you lost a lot of blood.

504
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,430
- Where's dad?
- He's right here.

505
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,910
He's right here, Dean.

506
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,340
Go check on him.

507
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,210
Dad?

508
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,340
Sammy!
It's still alive.

509
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,900
It's inside me. I can feel it.

510
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,320
You shoot me.

511
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,830
You shoot me!
You shoot me in the heart, son!

512
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,540
- Do it, now!
- Sam, don't you do it.

513
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,820
- Don't you do it.
- You've got to hurry.

514
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,820
I can't hold on to it much longer.

515
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,270
You shoot me, son!

516
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,100
Shoot me!

517
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,680
Son, I'm begging you!

518
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,280
We can end this here and now!

519
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,560
Sammy!

520
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,700
Sam, no.

521
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,510
You do this!

522
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,780
Sammy!

523
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,190
Sam, Sam...

524
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,760
"Bad Moon Rising"
by Credence Clearwater Revival

525
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:13,120
I hear hurricanes a-blowin'.

526
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:18,480
I know the end is comin' soon.

527
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,950
Look, just hold on, all right?
The hospital is only 10 minutes away.

528
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,730
I'm surprised at you, Sammy.

529
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,440
Why didn't you kill it?

530
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,260
I thought we saw eye-to-eye on this.
Killing this demon comes first...

531
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,670
before me,
before everything.

532
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,090
No, sir,

533
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,920
not before everything.

534
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,050
Look, we've still got the colt.

535
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,740
We still have the one bullet left.

536
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,810
We just have to start over,
