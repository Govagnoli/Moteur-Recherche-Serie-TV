1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,300
Take your brother outside
as fast as you can !

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,500
Now, Dean ! Go !

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:10,880
Mary !

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:11,640
No !

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,500
Dad's on a hunting trip.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,020
And he hasn't been home
in a few days.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,370
I swore I was done hunting.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,120
I can't do this alone.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,390
No !

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,960
We got work to do.

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,940
This was dad's single most
valuable possession.

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,070
Everything he knows about
every evil thing is in here.

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,070
I think he wants us to pick up
where he left off

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,370
You know, saving people,

15
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,440
hunting things,

16
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,360
family business.

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:39,850
No.

18
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,210
I got to find
Jessica's killer.

19
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,680
It's the only thing
I can think about.

20
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,060
Sam, You know
we're gonna find dad,

21
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:44,480
right ?

22
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,370
Yeah. I know.

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,280
Nervous flyer ?

24
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,350
It's that obvious, huh ?

25
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,590
You know, what are the odds
of dying in a plane crash ?

26
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,520
I mean, what

27
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,680
20,000 to one ?

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,910
Wow.

29
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,460
That's, uh, really reassuring.
Thank you.

30
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,780
Thanks.

31
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:08,990
Miranda,

32
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,760
how are you today ?

33
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,130
I'm doing just fine, Chuck.

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,790
Welcome aboard.

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,120
15c towards the back
of the plane, on the right.

36
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,140
Have a nice flight, sir.

37
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,190
Oh, I'm counting on it.

38
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,930
Um...

39
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,010
uh, 11F,

40
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,900
- that's the middle of the plane, on...
- Thank you

41
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,710
...the left.

42
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,910
Excuse me.

43
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,910
Do you know how long
we've been up ?

44
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,290
Oh, uh...
about 40 minutes.

45
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:56,810
Wow.

46
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,410
Time really
does fly, huh ?

47
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,320
Excuse me.

48
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,810
I've got to stretch my legs.

49
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,710
you, what the hell
are you doing ?!

50
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,860
Morning, sunshine.

51
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:42,910
What time is it ?

52
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,320
Huh, It's about 5:45.

53
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,150
In the morning ?

54
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,600
Yep.

55
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,820
Where does the day go ?

56
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,840
Did you get any sleep
last night ?

57
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,340
Yeah, I grabbed
a couple hours.

58
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,020
You, liar

59
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,030
'cause I was up at 3:00,

60
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,490
and you were watching
a George Foreman infomercial.

61
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,320
Hey, what can I say ?

62
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,230
It's riveting tv.

63
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,970
When was the last time
you got a good night's sleep ?

64
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:00,770
I don't know,

65
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,370
A little while, I guess.
It's not a big deal

66
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,250
Yeah, it is.

67
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,060
I appreciate your concern.

68
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,390
I'm not concerned about you.

69
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,830
It's your job to keep my ass
alive, so I need you sharp.

70
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,710
Seriously, are you still having
nightmares about Jess ?

71
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,500
Yeah.

72
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,830
But it's not just her.
It's everything.

73
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,890
I just forgot, you know ?
This job.

74
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,180
man, it gets to you.

75
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,420
You can't let it. You can't
bring it home like that.

76
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,220
So, what ?

77
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:29,800
All this it...

78
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,090
never keeps you up at night ?

79
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,660
Never ?

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,690
You're never afraid ?

81
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,800
No, not really.

82
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,550
That's not fear.

83
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,670
That is precaution.

84
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,090
All right, whatever.

85
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,200
I'm too tired to argue.

86
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,320
Hello ?

87
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,020
Dean,

88
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,890
it's Jerry Panowski.

89
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,790
You and your dad helped me out
a couple years back.

90
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,760
Oh, all right,

91
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,500
yeah, up in kittanning,
Pennsylvania, the poltergeist thing.

92
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,820
It's not back, is it ?

93
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,460
No.

94
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,350
No.

95
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,340
Thank god, no.

96
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,460
But it's something else, and...

97
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,260
Well, I think
it could be a lot worse.

98
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,420
What is it ?

99
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:19,960
Can we talk in person ?

100
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,230
Thanks for making the trip so quick.

101
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,800
I ought to be doing you guys a
favor, not the other way around.

102
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,170
Dean and your dad
really helped me out.

103
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,330
Yeah, he told me. It was a poltergeist ?

104
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,020
Poltergeist ?

105
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,080
Man, I loved that movie.

106
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,920
Hey, nobody's talking to you.
Keep walking.

107
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,480
Damn right it was a poltergeist
practically tore our house apart.

108
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,360
Tell you something

109
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,240
if it wasn't for you and your dad,

110
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,460
I probably wouldn't be alive.

111
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,310
Your dad said you were off at college.
Is that right?

112
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,080
Yeah, I was. I'm...

113
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,450
taking some time off.

114
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,270
Well, he was real proud of you.
I could tell.

115
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,000
He talked about you
all the time.

116
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:58,930
He did ?

117
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,260
Yeah, you bet he did.

118
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,630
Oh, hey, I tried to get
ahold of him, but I couldn't.

119
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,110
How's he doing, anyway ?

120
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,170
He's, um...

121
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,030
...wrapped up
in a job right now.

122
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,760
Well, we're missing
the old man.

123
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,940
We get sam.

124
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,220
Even trade, huh ?

125
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,150
No, not by a long shot.

126
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,360
I got something
I want you guys to hear.

127
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,220
I listened to this.

128
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,180
Well,

129
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,850
it sounded like it was up your alley

130
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,010
Normally I wouldn't have access to this.

131
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,740
It's the cockpit voice recorder
for united britannia flight 2485.

132
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,890
It was one of ours.

133
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:29,830
Maydayé

134
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,380
Took off from here,

135
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,650
crashed about 200 miles south.

136
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,960
Now, they're saying
mechanical failure.

137
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,410
Cabin depressurized somehow.
Nobody knows why.

138
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,010
Over 100 people on board.

139
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,880
Only seven got out alive.

140
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,590
Pilot was one.

141
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,040
His name is chuck lambert.
He's a good friend of mine.

142
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,540
Chuck is, uh...

143
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,400
well, he's pretty broken up about it,

144
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,030
like it was his fault.

145
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,630
You don't think it was?

146
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,970
No, I don't.

147
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,130
Jerry,

148
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,080
we're gonna need passenger manifests,

149
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,590
hum...a list of survivors.

150
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,080
All right.

151
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,810
And huh...

152
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,380
any way we can take
a look at the wreckage?

153
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,230
The other stuff is no problem,

154
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,080
but the wreckage

155
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,690
fellas, the ntsb has it locked
down in an evidence warehouse.

156
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,090
No way I've got
that kind of clearance.

157
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,050
No problem.

158
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,750
Hey

159
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,350
Hi.

160
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,200
You've been in there forever.

161
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,670
You can't rush perfection.

162
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,460
Homeland security?

163
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,490
That's pretty illegal,

164
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,250
even for us.

165
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:53,540
Yeah, well,

166
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,860
it's something new, you know?

167
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,510
People haven't seen it
a thousand times.

168
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,050
All right, so, what do you got?

169
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:02,880
Well,

170
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,380
there's definitely E.V.P.
on the cockpit voice recorder.

171
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:05,810
Yeah?

172
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:06,370
Listen.

173
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,780
"No survivors"?

174
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,350
What's that supposed to mean?

175
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,780
There were seven survivors.

176
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:18,950
Got me.

177
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,600
So, what are you thinking?
A haunted flight?

178
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,610
There's a long history of spirits and

179
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,590
death omens on planes and ships,

180
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,670
like phantom travelers.

181
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,100
Mm-hmm

182
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,010
Or remember flight 401?

183
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,670
Right

184
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,620
the one that crashed,

185
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,120
the airline salvaged some of this parts,*

186
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,220
put it in other planes,

187
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,680
then the spirit of the pilot and
copilot haunted those flights.

188
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,080
Right.

189
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,610
Yep.

190
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,720
Maybe we got a similar deal.

191
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,730
All rigth so, survivors which one
do you want to talk to first?

192
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,440
Third on the list Max Jaffey.

193
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,090
Why him?

194
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,300
For one, he's from around here.

195
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,070
And two,

196
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,980
if anyone saw anything weird.

197
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,110
he did.

198
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,060
What makes you say that?

199
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,590
Well, I spoke to his mother,

200
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,660
and she told me where to find him.

201
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,650
I don't understand.

202
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,550
I already spoke with homeland security.

203
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,460
Right.

204
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,430
Some new information has come up.

205
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,520
So if you could just answer
a couple questions...

206
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,020
just before the plane went down,

207
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,940
did you notice anything unusual?

208
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:09,970
Like what?

209
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,930
Strange lights,

210
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,850
weird noises, maybe...

211
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,920
voices.

212
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,570
No, nothing.

213
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,260
Mr. Joffey

214
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,640
Jaffey.

215
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,420
Jaffey.

216
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,660
You checked yourself in here,

217
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,210
right?

218
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,160
Can I ask why?

219
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,910
I was a little stressed.

220
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,710
I survived a plane crash.

221
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:31,890
And that's

222
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,750
what terrified you?

223
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,890
That's what you were afraid of?

224
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,420
I... I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

225
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,320
I think maybe you did
see something up there.

226
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,280
We need to know what.

227
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,780
No.

228
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,960
No, I was...

229
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:43,820
delusional

230
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,500
seeing things.

231
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,750
He was seeing things.

232
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,770
It's okay.

233
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,010
Then just tell us what
you thought you saw, please.

234
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,220
There was...

235
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,010
this...

236
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:02,990
man.

237
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,480
And, uh,

238
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,950
he had these...

239
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,610
eyes...

240
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,420
these, uh...

241
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,600
black eyes.

242
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,120
And I saw him

243
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,970
I thought I saw him...

244
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,370
what?

245
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,700
He opened the emergency exit.

246
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,400
But that's...

247
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,520
that's impossible,

248
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,150
right? I mean, I looked it up.

249
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,040
There's something like

250
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,220
two tons of pressure on that door.

251
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,870
Yeah...

252
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,600
This man, huh...

253
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,100
did he seem to appear and disappear.

254
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,660
Rapidly.It would look
something like a mirage.

255
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,670
What are you, nuts?

256
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,940
He was a passenger.

257
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,820
He was sitting right in front of me.

258
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,820
Say here we are

259
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,010
George Phelps, seat 20c.

260
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,110
Hmm.

261
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,160
Man, I don't care how strong you are.

262
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,540
Even yoked up on pcp or something,

263
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,810
no way you can open up an
emergency door during a flight.

264
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,730
Not if you're human.

265
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,960
But maybe this guy George
was something else

266
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,370
some kind of creature,
maybe, in human form.

267
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,510
Does that look like
a creature's lair to you?

268
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,140
This is your late husband?

269
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,520
Yes, that was my george.

270
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,380
And you said he was a...

271
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:40,980
dentist?

272
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:41,950
Mm-hmm.

273
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,420
He was headed to a convention in Denver.

274
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,170
Do you know that
he was petrified to fly?

275
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,080
For him to go like that...

276
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,840
how long were you married?

277
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,330
13 years.

278
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,220
In all that time,

279
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,440
did you ever notice anything...

280
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,270
strange about him,

281
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,350
anything out of the ordinary?

282
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,120
Well...

283
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,290
uh, he had acid reflux,

284
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,460
if that's what you mean.

285
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,610
I mean it goes without saying.

286
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,990
It just doesn't make any sense.

287
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,940
A middle-aged dentist with an ulcer

288
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,630
is not exactly evil personified.

289
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,450
You know what we need to do
is get inside that ntsb warehouse,

290
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,900
check out the wreckage.

291
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,560
Okay.

292
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,730
But if we're gonna go that route,

293
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,570
we'd better look the part.

294
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,910
I look like one of the blues brothers.

295
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,020
No, you don't.

296
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,670
You look more like a...

297
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,370
seventh-grader at his first dance.

298
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,270
I hate this thing.

299
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,730
Hey.

300
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,750
You want into that warehouse or not?

301
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,020
what is that?

302
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,280
It's an E.M.F. Meter...

303
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,360
reads electromagnetic frequencies.

304
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,930
Yeah, I know what
an E.M.F. Meter is,

305
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,320
but why does that one look like
a busted-up walkman?

306
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,500
That's what I made it out of.

307
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,150
It's homemade.

308
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,290
Yeah, I can see that.

309
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,530
Check out emergency door handle.

310
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,930
What is this stuff?

311
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,330
One way to find out.

312
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,960
Homeland security?

313
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,220
What?

314
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,720
One team of you guys isn't enough?

315
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,150
What are you talking about?

316
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,430
Two of your buddies went inside
not five minutes ago.

317
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,530
These monkey suits do come in handy.

318
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,760
Listen Chuck

319
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,930
It's like getting back
on a horse,

320
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,910
only in this case, a little twin engine.

321
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,010
Not even a horse

322
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,930
more like a pony.

323
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,800
I'll be right there with you too. *

324
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,750
Anytime you feel like you don't want
the wheel, I'll take over.

325
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,430
Look, Chuck,

326
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,080
we don't have to do this today.

327
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,230
I'm not trying to rush you.

328
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,810
No, the...

329
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,850
the waiting is worse.

330
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,050
Okay, they're filling up
the tank. Then we go.

331
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,780
Huh.

332
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,800
This stuff is covered in sulfur.

333
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,680
You're sure?

334
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,170
Take a look for yourself.

335
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,520
"You effin' piece of..."

336
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,810
if you fellows will excuse me,

337
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,240
I have an idiot to fire.

338
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,330
Hmm.

339
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,980
Here is not too many things that leave
behind a sulfuric residue.*

340
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,020
Demonic possession?

341
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,580
It would explain how a mortal man would have
the strength to open up an emergency hatch.

342
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,100
If the guy was possessed,

343
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,010
it's possible.

344
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,620
This goes way beyond floating over a bed or

345
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,500
barfing pea soup.

346
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,030
What mean it's one thing
to possess a person,

347
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,940
but to use them to take down
an entire airplane?

348
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,730
You ever heard of something
like this before?

349
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:05,420
Never.

350
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,810
I'm ready.

351
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,820
Let's do this.

352
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,600
How you feeling?

353
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,640
I feel great.

354
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,640
You'll be back flying jumbos
before you know it.

355
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:25,830
I hope so.

356
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,240
How long we been up?

357
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,470
Huh... Almost 40 minutes.

358
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:33,260
Wow.

359
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:34,930
Time really does fly.

360
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,000
so,

361
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,420
every religion in every world culture

362
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,240
has the concept of demons
and demonic possession, right?

363
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,430
I mean christian, native american,
hindu. You name it.

364
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,140
Yeah, but none of them
describe anything like this.

365
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,330
Well, that's not exactly true.

366
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,720
You see according to japanese beliefs,

367
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,400
certain demons are
behind certain disasters,

368
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,290
both natural

369
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,230
and man-made

370
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,470
One causes earthquakes.
Another causes disease.

371
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,010
And this one
causes plane crashes?

372
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,270
All right, so, what?

373
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,270
We have a demonthat's evolved with the times

374
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,990
and found a way
to ratchet up the body count?

375
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,460
Yeah.

376
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,140
You know,

377
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,310
who knows how many planes
it's brought down before this one?

378
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,560
What?

379
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,000
I don't know, man.
This isn't our normal gig.

380
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,150
I mean, demons,
they don't want anything just

381
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,040
death and destructionfor its own sake.

382
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:52,700
This is big.

383
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,180
I wish dad was here.

384
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,440
Yeah. Me too.

385
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,360
Hello?

386
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,510
Dean it's Jerry

387
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,380
Oh, hey, Jerry.

388
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,600
My pilot friend...

389
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,620
Chuck Lambert, is dead.

390
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,100
Wha...

391
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,570
Jerry, I'm sorry. What happened?

392
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,900
He and his buddy went up
in a small twin.

393
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:19,960
About an hour ago.

394
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,400
The plane went down.

395
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,520
Where'd this happen?

396
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,920
About 60 miles west of here,
near nazareth.

397
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,870
I'll try to ignore the irony in that.

398
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,650
I'm sorry?

399
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:28,370
Nothing.

400
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,960
Jerry hang in there, all right?
We'll catch up with you soon.

401
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:33,810
Another crash?

402
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:34,520
Yeah.

403
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,350
Let's go.

404
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,070
Where?

405
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,340
Nazareth.

406
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:49,810
Sulfur?

407
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,580
Well, that's great.

408
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,960
All right, that's two plane
crashes involving Chuck Lambert.

409
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,000
This demon sounds likeit was after him.

410
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,440
With all due respect to Chuck,

411
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,530
if that's the case,
that would be the good news.

412
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:04,710
What's the bad news?

413
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,400
Chuck's plane went down
exactly 40 minutes into flight.

414
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,410
And get this

415
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,100
so did flight 2485.

416
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,180
40 minutes?

417
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,230
What does that mean?

418
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,060
It's biblical numerology.

419
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,250
You know Noah's ark, it rained for 40days.

420
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,250
The number means death.

421
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,340
I went back,

422
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,990
and there have been six plane
crashes over the last decade

423
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,710
that all went down
exactly 40 minutes in.

424
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,580
Any survivors?

425
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:26,700
No.

426
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:27,630
Or not

427
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,740
until now,at least

428
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,980
not until flight 2485, for some reason.

429
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,390
And the cockpit voice recorder

430
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,720
remember what the E.V.P. Said?

431
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:35,840
"No survivors."

432
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,040
It's going after all the survivors.

433
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,270
Something finish the job.

434
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:47,540
Really?

435
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,850
Well, thank you for taking our survey,

436
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,130
and if you do plan to fly,

437
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,930
please don't forget your friendsat united britannia airlines.

438
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,090
Thanks.

439
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,140
All right.

440
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,820
That takes care of Blaines
Anderson and Dennis Holloway.

441
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,250
They're not flying anytime soon.

442
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,770
So our only wildcard is the flight
attendant amanda walker.

443
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,530
Right

444
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,600
Her sister Karen said her flight
leaves Indianapolis at 8:00.

445
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,150
Yeah but it's her first night backon the job.

446
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,490
That sounds like just our luck.

447
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,360
Dean, this is a 5-hour drive made

448
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,890
even with you behind the wheel.

449
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,970
Call amanda's cellphone again,

450
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,260
see if we can't head her off at the pass.

451
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,640
I already left her three voice messages.

452
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,670
She must have turned her cellphone off.

453
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,370
God,we're never gonna make it.

454
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,100
We'll make it.

455
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:36,580
right there.

456
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,780
They're boarding in 30 minutes.

457
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,490
Okay.

458
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,330
We still have some cards to play.

459
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,330
We need to find a phone.

460
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,310
Airport Services.

461
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,470
Hi. Gate 13.

462
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,660
Who are you calling, Sir

463
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,330
I'm trying to contact an Amanda Walker.

464
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,180
She's a flight attendant on flight, um...

465
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,560
Flight 424.

466
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,690
"Amanda walker,"

467
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,600
"Amanda Walker, you have a phone call"

468
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,440
"white courtesy phone, gate 13."

469
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,300
Come on.

470
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,050
This is amanda walker.

471
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,160
Miss walker.

472
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,340
Hi, this is Dr. James Headfield

473
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,470
from st. Francis memorial hospital.

474
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,550
We have a Karen Walker here.

475
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,440
Why Karen?

476
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,520
Nothing serious just a minor car accident,

477
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,020
but she was injured, so

478
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,050
Wa-wait, that's impossible.
I just got off the phone with her.

479
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,810
You what?

480
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:23,720
Five minutes ago.

481
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,350
She's at her house,
cramming for a final.

482
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,280
Who is this?

483
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,430
Uh, well...

484
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,900
there must be some mistake.

485
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,890
And how would you even know I was here?

486
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,120
Is this one of Vince's friends?

487
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,760
Guilty as charged.

488
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,550
Wow. This is unbelievable.

489
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,960
He's really sorry.

490
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,110
Well, you tell him
to mind his own business

491
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,860
and stay out of my life, okay?

492
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,840
Yes, but...

493
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,800
he really needs to see you tonight,

494
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,820
so

495
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,360
No, I'm sorry. It's too late.

496
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,550
Don't be like that.

497
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,060
Come on. The guy's...

498
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,780
...a mess. Really. It's pathetic.

499
00:23:59,090 --> 00:23:59,750
Really?

500
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,690
Oh, yeah.

501
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,790
Look, I've got to go. Um...

502
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,830
Tell him to call me when I land.

503
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,680
No, no. Wait, Amanda. Amanda!

504
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,090
How are you?

505
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,580
- Hey, boss.
- Hey

506
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,180
Damn it!

507
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,710
So close.

508
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,780
All right, it's time for plan "B."

509
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,260
We're getting on that plane.

510
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,990
Oh,oh,Now, just hold on a second.

511
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:34,680
Dean,

512
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,940
That plane is leaving

513
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,450
with over 100 passengers on board,

514
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,370
and if we're right,

515
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,240
that plane is gonna crash.

516
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,010
I know.

517
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,670
Okay.

518
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,360
We're getting on the plane, we need
to find that demon and exorcise it.

519
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,470
I'll get the tickets. You get
whatever you can out of the trunk.

520
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,660
* security.

521
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,990
Meet me back here in five minutes.

522
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,900
Are you okay?

523
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,430
No, not really.

524
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,770
What? What's wrong?

525
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,840
Well, I kind of have
this problem with, uh...

526
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,700
flying?

527
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,760
It's never really been
an issue until now.

528
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:07,920
You're joking, right?

529
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,100
Do I look like I'm joking?

530
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,360
Why do you think
I drive everywhere, sam?

531
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,170
All right. Uh, I'll go.

532
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:15,840
What?

533
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,860
I'll do this oneon my own.

534
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,150
Are you, nuts?

535
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,010
You said that the plane's gonna crash.

536
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,990
Dean, we can do it together,
or I can do this for myself.

537
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,840
I'm not seeing a third option, here.

538
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,490
Come on!

539
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:27,790
Really?

540
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:30,860
Man...

541
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,090
- Just try to relax.
- Just try to shut up.

542
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,410
You're humming Metallica?

543
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,550
Calms me down.

544
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,470
Look, man,

545
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,930
I get you're nervous, all right?

546
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,460
But you got to stay focused.

547
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,250
Okay.

548
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,140
I mean, we got

549
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,010
32 minutes and counting
to track this thing down

550
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:30,230
or who Everit's possessing, anyway
and perform a full-on exorcism.

551
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,350
On a crowded plane.That's gonna be easy.

552
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,020
take it one step at a time, all right?

553
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,410
Now,

554
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,490
who is it possessing?

555
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,750
It's usually gonna be somebody

556
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,770
with some sort of weakness, you know,

557
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,840
a chink in the armor that
the demon can worm through,

558
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,930
somebody with an addiction
or emotional distress.

559
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,510
Well,

560
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,410
this is Amanda's first flight after the crash.

561
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,010
If I were her, I'd be pretty messed up.

562
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,760
Mm-hmm.

563
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:56,420
Excuse me.

564
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,660
Are you Amanda?

565
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,630
No, I'm not.

566
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,440
Oh, my mistake.

567
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,160
All right, well, that's got
to be amanda back there,so

568
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,940
I'll go talk to her,

569
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,070
and, uh, I'll get a read
on her mental state.

570
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,750
What if she's already possessed?

571
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,460
There's ways to test that.

572
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,810
I brought holy water.

573
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,350
No. I think we can go more subtle.

574
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,910
If she's possessed, she'll
flinch at the name of god.

575
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,380
Oh. Nice.

576
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,120
Hey.

577
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,930
What?

578
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,960
Say it in latin.

579
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:31,880
I know.

580
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,520
Okay.

581
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,370
Hey!

582
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,640
What?!

583
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,720
Uh, in latin, it's "Cristo."

584
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,580
Dude, I know! I'm not an idiot!

585
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,140
- Hi.
- Hi.

586
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,210
Can I help you with something?

587
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,160
Oh, no.

588
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,110
I'm just a bit of an uneasy flier.

589
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,060
It makes me feel better
to walk around a little bit.

590
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,050
Oh, it happens to the best of us.

591
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,720
Of course, you being a stewardess,
I guess flying comes easy to you.

592
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,960
You'd be surprised.

593
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,160
Really? You're a nervous flier?

594
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,420
Yeah, maybe a little bit.

595
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,330
How is it that,being a stewardess,

596
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,710
you're scared to fly?

597
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,980
Kind of a long story.

598
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,620
Right. I'm sorry for asking.

599
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,470
It's okay.

600
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,340
You ever consider other employment?

601
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,370
No.

602
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,480
Look, everybody's scared of something.

603
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,880
I just, uh...

604
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,550
I'm not gonna let it hold me back.

605
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,480
Huh.

606
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,100
So...

607
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,600
Cristo.

608
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,130
I'm sorry. Did you say something?

609
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,040
Cristo?

610
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,340
I-I didn't, I didn't

611
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,590
Yeah, nothing. Never mind.

612
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,480
Okay.

613
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,960
All right, well, she's got to be the
most well-adjusted person on the planet.

614
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,020
- You said "cristo"?
- Yeah.

615
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,360
- And?
- There's no demon in her.

616
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,890
There's no demon getting in her.

617
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,680
So, if it's on the plane,
it can be anyone...

618
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:14,840
anywhere.

619
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,710
- Come on! That can't be normal!
- Hey, hey,

620
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,050
it's just a little turbulence.

621
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,890
Sam, this plane is going to crash, okay?

622
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,340
So quit treating me like I'm friggin' fool.

623
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,150
- You need to calm down.
- No, I'm sorry I can't.

624
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,460
Yes, you can.

625
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,680
Dude, Stow the touchy-feely,
self-help yoga crap.

626
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,750
- It's not helping.
- Listen, if you're panicked,

627
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,970
you're wide opento demonic possession,

628
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,990
so you need to calm yourself down

629
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,060
right now.

630
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,510
Good.

631
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,480
Now,

632
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,320
I found an exorcism in here
that I think is gonna work

633
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,090
the ritual romano.

634
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,970
What do we have to do?

635
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,180
It's two parts.

636
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,580
The first part expels the demon from the victim's body.

637
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,730
It makes it manifest,
which actually makes it more powerful.

638
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:00,740
More powerful?

639
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:01,730
- Yeah.
- How?

640
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,800
Well, it doesn't need
to possess someone anymore.

641
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,610
It can just wreak havoc on its own.

642
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,010
Oh. And why is that a good thing?

643
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,450
Well, because the second part

644
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,720
sends the bastard back to hell

645
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,240
once and for all.

646
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,360
First thing's first we got to find it.

647
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,670
Ohh! Don't do that.

648
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,550
Anything?

649
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,550
No, nothing. How much time we got?

650
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,660
15 minutes.

651
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,150
Maybe we missed somebody.

652
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,370
Maybe the thing's just not on the plane.

653
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,510
You believe that?

654
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,310
Well, I will if you will.

655
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,460
What? What is it?

656
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,440
Cristo.

657
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,260
she's not gonna believe this.

658
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,410
12 minutes, dude.

659
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,570
Oh, hi.

660
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,850
Flight's not too bumpy for you, I hope.

661
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,020
Actually, that's kind of what
we need to talk to you about.

662
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,060
Um, okay.What can I do for you?

663
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,080
This is gonna sound nuts, but

664
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,650
we just don't have time for the whole
"the true this out there" speech right now.

665
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,790
Look, we know you were on flight 2485.

666
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,370
Who are you guys?

667
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,580
Now, we've spoken to some other survivors.

668
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,020
We know something brought down that plane
and it wasn't a mechanical failure.

669
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,060
We need your help

670
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,800
Because we need to stop from happening again.

671
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:02,790
- Here. Now.
- I'm sorry

672
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,630
- Here. I-I'm very busy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second.

673
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,050
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

674
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,530
But listen to me, huh...

675
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,850
the pilot in 2485, Chuck Lambert.

676
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:11,820
he's dead.

677
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,480
Wait. What?

678
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:14,820
What, Chuck is dead?

679
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,600
He died in a plane crash.

680
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,240
That's two plane crashes in two months.

681
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,860
That doesn't strike you as strange?

682
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,310
Look, there was something wrong with 2485.

683
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,630
Now maybe you're sensitive maybe you didn't

684
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,000
but there's something wrong with this flight, too.

685
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,630
Amanda,you have to believe us.

686
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,670
On...

687
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,260
on 2485,

688
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,060
there was this man.

689
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,160
He...had these eyes.

690
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,030
Yes. That's exactly
what we're talking about.

691
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,650
I don't understand what are you asking me to do?

692
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,420
Okay. The copilot,
we need you bring him back here.

693
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,450
Why?
What does he have to do with anything?

694
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,430
Don't have time to explain.

695
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,830
We just need to talk to him. Okay?

696
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,280
How am I supposed to go in the cockpit

697
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,090
- and get the copilot
- *

698
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,770
I * there's something broken back here,

699
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,150
whatever will get him
out of that cockpit.

700
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,600
Do you know that I could lose my job

701
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,730
- if you --
- you're gonna lose a lot more if you don't help us out.*

702
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,840
Okay.

703
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,820
Yeah, what's the problem?

704
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,410
Wait. What are you doing? You said
you were just gonna talk to him.

705
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,870
We are gonna talk to him.

706
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,920
Oh, my god.What's wrong with him?

707
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,880
Look. We need you calm.

708
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,650
- We need you outside the curtain.
- well, I don't underst..., I don't know

709
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,240
Don't let anybody in, okay?
Can you do that?

710
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,510
Can you do that?

711
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,370
Amanda?

712
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,140
Okay.

713
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,420
Okay.

714
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,150
Hurry up, sam. I don't know
how much longer I can hold him.

715
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,940
I know what happened to your girlfriend!

716
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,310
She must have died screaming!

717
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,570
Even now, she's burning!

718
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,080
Sam!

719
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,700
"prayer"...

720
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,030
I got him.

721
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:18,920
Where'd he go?

722
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,870
He's in the plane.

723
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,400
Hurry up.We got to finish it.

724
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,330
I don't know.

725
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,590
I was walking through the airport,

726
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,100
then it all goes blank.

727
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,480
I don't even remember getting on the plane.

728
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,550
Anything else?

729
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,800
No, that's all.

730
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,390
"thank you"

731
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,570
Let's get out of here.

732
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,250
You okay?

733
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:33,620
Dean,

734
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,110
it knew about Jessica.

735
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,990
Sam, these things,t-they read minds.

736
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,070
They lie.

737
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,000
All right?That's all it was.

738
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,220
Yeah.

739
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,340
Come on.

740
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,630
Nobody knows what
you guys did, but i do.

741
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,640
A lot of people could have been killed.

742
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,360
Your dad's gonna be real proud.

743
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,160
We'll see you around, Jerry.

744
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,240
You know, Jerry.

745
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,110
Yeah.

746
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,890
I meant to ask you how did you get
my cellphone number, anyway?

747
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,510
I've only had it for like six months.

748
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,900
Your dad gave it to me.

749
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:18,940
What?

750
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,250
When did you talk to him?

751
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,750
I mean, I didn't exactly talk to him,but

752
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,690
I called his number. His voice
message said to give you a call.

753
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,310
Thanks again, guys.

754
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,880
This doesn't make any sense, man.

755
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,960
I've called dad's number like 50 times.

756
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,230
It's been out of service.

757
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,630
This is John Winchester.

758
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,200
I can't be reached.

759
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,460
