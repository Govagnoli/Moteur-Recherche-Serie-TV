1
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,130
Can't keep kids out of this place.

2
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,450
What is it anyway?

3
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,930
I forgot you're not a local.

4
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,050
You don't know the legend.

5
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,210
Legend?

6
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,210
Every town's got its stories, right?

7
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,210
Ours is Roosevelt asylum.

8
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,050
They say it's haunted with the ghosts of the patients.

9
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,330
Spend the night,

10
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,450
spirits will drive you insane.

11
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,610
Hello?!

12
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,050
Police officers!

13
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,370
Police officers!

14
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,090
You tell me these kids brought bolt cutters?

15
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:55,890
Come on.

16
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,010
Let's split up.

17
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,450
All right.

18
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,850
Hello?

19
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,450
Hello?

20
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,960
All right.

21
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,040
Come on out.

22
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,400
Kelly, you copy?

23
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,200
Jeez!

24
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Where the hell you been?!

25
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,920
In there.

26
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,120
What was it? See anything?

27
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,000
No.

28
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,600
This is patrol 1 4. We are clear, we return to the station

29
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,440
Hey.

30
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,240
So, what?

31
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,440
You're still not talking to me?

32
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,280
Walt.

33
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,310
I said I was sorry about before.

34
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,030
How many times do I have to say it?

35
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,190
No, dad was in California last we heard from him.

36
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,350
We just thought if he comes to you for munitions,

37
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,150
maybe you've seen him in the last few weeks.

38
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,130
- Just call us if you hear anything.
- Okay.

39
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,140
Thanks.

40
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,110
Caleb hasn't heard
from him?

41
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:05,800
Nope.

42
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,100
Neither has Jefferson or pastor Jim.

43
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,000
What about the journal?
Any leads in there?

44
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,650
No. Same last time I looked.

45
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,140
Nothing I can make out.

46
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,730
I love the guy, but I swear
he writes like freaking Yoda.

47
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,190
And maybe we should call the feds,

48
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,360
file a missing person's out.

49
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,660
We talked about this. Dad would be
pissed if we put the feds on his tail.

50
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,790
I don't care anymore

51
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,850
After all that happened back in kansas,

52
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,850
I mean...

53
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,980
he should have been there, Dean.

54
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,960
You said so yourself.
You tried to call him and nothing.

55
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,010
I know.

56
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,750
I loose my cellphone.

57
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,600
You know, he could be dead
for all we know.

58
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,850
Don't say that.

59
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,630
He's not dead. He's...

60
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,930
He's what? He's hiding? He's busy?

61
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,350
I don't believe it.

62
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,850
What?

63
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,380
It's a-a text message.

64
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,590
It's coordinates.

65
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,390
You think dad was texting us?

66
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,840
He's given us coordinates before.

67
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,900
The man can barely work a toaster, Dean.

68
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,390
Sam, this is good news.

69
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,840
It means he's okay, or alive.

70
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,620
Was there a number on the caller I.D.?

71
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,830
Huh, it said "unknown."

72
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,120
Okay, well, where do the coordinates point?

73
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,370
That's the interesting part.

74
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,990
Rockford, Illinois.

75
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,090
Okay, and that's interesting how?

76
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,830
I checked the local rockford paper.
Take a look at this.

77
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,630
This cop, Walter Kelly,

78
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,650
comes home from his shift,
shoots his wife,

79
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,750
then puts the gun in his mouth,
blows his brains out.

80
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,890
Earlier that night, kelly and his partner

81
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,350
responded to a call
at the Roosevelt asylum.

82
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,890
Okay, I'm not following.
What does this have to do with us?

83
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,710
Dad earmarked the same asylum
in the journal.

84
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,690
Let's see.

85
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,910
Here.

86
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,530
"Seven unconfirmed sightings, two deaths"

87
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,110
till last week, at least.

88
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,090
I think this is where he wants us to go.

89
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,810
This is a job.

90
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,750
Dad wants us to work a job.

91
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,490
Maybe we'll meet up with him.
Maybe he's there.

92
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,500
Maybe he's not.

93
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,680
May He could be sending us there
by ourselves to hunting thing.

94
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,930
Who cares?

95
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,470
If he wants us there,
it's good enough for me.

96
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,450
This doesn't strike you as weird...

97
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,340
the texting,

98
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,840
- the coordinates?
- Sam.

99
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,260
Dad's telling us to go somewhere.
We're going.

100
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,490
You're Daniel Gunderson,
right, you're cop?

101
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,420
Yeah.

102
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,240
I'm...

103
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,530
Nigel Tufnel

104
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,660
with the chicago tribune.

105
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,150
Do you mind if I ask a couple questions

106
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,160
about your partner?

107
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,090
Yeah, I do.

108
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,020
I'm just trying to have a beer here.

109
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,270
I just want to hear
the story in your words.

110
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,860
A week ago, my partner
was sitting in that chair,

111
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,350
and now he's dead.

112
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,560
Are you gonna ambush me here?

113
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,330
Sorry,

114
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,860
but I need to know what happened.

115
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,650
Heyn buddy! How about leaving
the poor guy alone, huh?!

116
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,350
The man's an officer! Why don't
you show a little respect?!

117
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,420
You didn't have to do that.

118
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,750
Yeah, of course I did.

119
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,690
That guy's a serious jerk.

120
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,710
Let me buy you a beer, huh?

121
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,360
Two?

122
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,600
Thanks.

123
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,890
You shoved me kind of hard
in there, buddy boy.

124
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,350
I had to sell it, didn't I?

125
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,160
It's method acting.

126
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:28,980
Huh?

127
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,190
Never mind.

128
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,280
What did you find out from Gunderson?

129
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,970
So, Walter Kelly was a good cop.

130
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,750
Head of his class, even-keeled.

131
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,120
He had a bright future ahead of him.

132
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,720
What about at home?

133
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,620
He and his wife had a few fights. Like everybody.

134
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,110
But it was mostly smooth sailing.

135
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,810
They were even talking about having kids.

136
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,430
?All right, so how the kelly had some deep see the crazy way in the bus * ???

137
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,760
- or something else did it to him.
- Right.

138
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,580
What did Gunderson tell you about the asylum?

139
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,310
A lot.

140
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,150
So, apparently,
the cops chased the kids here...

141
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,380
into the south wing.

142
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,530
South wing, huh?

143
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,620
Wait a second.

144
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,610
South wing, south wing.

145
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,010
"1972,

146
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,030
three kids broke into the south wing.

147
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,560
Only one survived."

148
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,010
The way he tells it, one of his friends

149
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,910
went nuts and started lighting up the place.

150
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,410
So, whatever's going on,

151
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,980
south wing seems like the heart of it.

152
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,560
Yeah, but if kids are spelunking the asylum,

153
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,290
why aren't there a ton more deaths?

154
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,090
It looks like the doors
are usually chained.

155
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,750
They could have been
chained up for years.

156
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,890
Yeah, to keep people out.

157
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,110
Or to keep something in.

158
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,420
Let me know if you see
any dead people, Haley Joel.

159
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,630
Dude, enough.

160
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,170
I'm serious. You've got to be careful. Right.

161
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,650
I told you, it's not E.S.P.

162
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,840
I just have strange vibes, sometimes,

163
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,050
weird dreams.

164
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,910
Yeah, whatever.
Don't ask, don't tell.

165
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,480
Do you get any reading
on that thing or not?

166
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,420
No. Of course,
it doesn't mean nobody's home.

167
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,650
Spirits can't appear during certain hours of day.

168
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,100
The freaks come out at night.

169
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,270
- Ya.
- Hey Sam

170
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,810
Who do you think
is a hotter psychic

171
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,830
Patricia Arquette,
Jennifer Love Hewitt or you?

172
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,910
Man.

173
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,460
Electroshock,

174
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,160
lobotomies. They did
some twisted stuff to these people,

175
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,240
kind of like my man Jack
in "cuckoo's nest."

176
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,730
So, what do you think?

177
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,960
Ghosts are possessing people?

178
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,410
Maybe.

179
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,130
Maybe it's more like Amityville
or the smurl haunting.

180
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,550
Ah, spirits driving them insane,

181
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,260
kind of like my man Jack
in "the shining."

182
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,830
Dean...

183
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,820
When are we going to talk about it?

184
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,550
Talk about what?

185
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,120
About the fact that dad's not here.

186
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,140
Oh, uh, let's see, never.

187
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,070
I'm being serious, man.

188
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:37,880
So am I, sam.

189
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,270
Look. He sent us here.
He obviously wants us here.

190
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,560
We'll just have to
pick up the search later.

191
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,100
It doesn't matter what he wants.

192
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,360
See, that attitude right there,

193
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,300
that is why I always got the extra cookie.

194
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,510
Dad could be in trouble.

195
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,050
We should be looking for him.

196
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,800
We deserve some answers, Dean. I mean,
this is our family were talking about..

197
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,170
I understand that, sam,

198
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,300
but he's given us an order.

199
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,960
So what ? We've got to
always follow dad's orders?

200
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,250
Of course we do.

201
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,620
Sanford Ellicott

202
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,800
You know what we got to do?

203
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,940
We've got to find out
more about the south wing,

204
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,970
see if something happened here.

205
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,020
Sam Winchester?

206
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,760
That's me.

207
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,810
Come on in.

208
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,220
Thanks again for see me last minute.

209
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,980
Dr. Ellicott?

210
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,920
Ellicott, that name.

211
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,150
Wasn't there a dr. Sanford Ellicott?

212
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,060
Yeah, he was a chief
psychiatrist somewhere.

213
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,010
My father was chief of staff
at the old Roosevelt asylum.

214
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,140
How did you know?

215
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,700
Huh, well, I'm sort of
a local-history buff.

216
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,500
Hey, wasn't there an incident
or something in the...

217
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,560
in the hospital, I guess,
in the south wing, right?

218
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,060
We're on your dollar, Sam.

219
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,440
We're here to talk about you.

220
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,350
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, sure.

221
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,100
- So?
- So.

222
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,350
How's things?

223
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,820
Uh, things are good, doctor.

224
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,670
Good.

225
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,080
What you been doing?

226
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:39,980
Uh...

227
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,690
same old. I've just been on a...

228
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,710
on a road trip with my brother.

229
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,960
Was that fun?

230
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,950
Loads.

231
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,570
Um...

232
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,070
You know... We...

233
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,610
met a lot of...

234
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,430
interesting people.

235
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,200
Mm-hmm.

236
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,820
Did a lot of, uh...

237
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,440
a lot of interesting things.

238
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,300
Uh...

239
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,280
You know,

240
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,700
what was it...

241
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,640
exactly that happened in the south wing?

242
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,610
- I forget...
- Look,

243
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,100
if you're a local-history buff,

244
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,080
then you know all
about the Roosevelt riot.

245
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,130
The riot?

246
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,320
- Well, no, I know, I'm just curious --
- Sam.

247
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,420
Let's cut the bull, shall we?

248
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,600
You're avoiding the subject.

249
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,560
What subject?

250
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,490
You.

251
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,630
Now, I'll make you a deal.

252
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,420
I'll tell you all about the Roosevelt riot

253
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,890
if you tell me something honest
about yourself...

254
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,540
like, uh...

255
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,050
this brother you're road-tripping with.

256
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,950
How do you feel about him?

257
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:50,830
Dude.

258
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,020
You were in there forever.
What the hell were you talking about?

259
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,510
Just the hospital,
you know.

260
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,280
And?

261
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,980
And the south wing,

262
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,550
it's where they housed the real hard cases,

263
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,330
psychotics, the criminally insane.

264
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,100
Sounds cozy.

265
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,320
Yeah, and one night in '64, they rioted,

266
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,380
attacked the staff,
attacked each other.

267
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,960
So, what, the patients took over
the asylum?

268
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,580
- Apparently.
- Any deaths?

269
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,760
Some patients, some staff.

270
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,970
I guess
it was pretty gory.

271
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,670
Some of the bodies
were never even recovered,

272
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,730
including our chief of staff, Ellicott.

273
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,100
Cops scoured every inch of the place,

274
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,970
but I guess the patients must have...

275
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,290
stuffed the bodies somewhere hidden.

276
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,700
- That's grim.
- Ya.

277
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,300
So they transferred
all the surviving patients

278
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,790
and shut down the hospital
for good.

279
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,670
All right so the * we've got a bunch of violent
deaths and unrecovered bodies.

280
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,170
Which could mean
a bunch of angry spirits.

281
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,680
Not good times. Let's check out
the hospital tonight.

282
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,230
Check this out.

283
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,380
Creepy...

284
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,370
yet terrifying.

285
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,780
I thought we were going to a movie.

286
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,210
This is better.
It's like we're in a movie.

287
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,770
I can't believe you call this a date.

288
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,940
Come on. That'll be fine.

289
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,770
That's look around.

290
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,510
Come on!

291
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,240
- What was that?
- Ugh!

292
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,700
Hey, look.

293
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,320
Come on, let's check it out.

294
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,060
I don't want to.

295
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,520
Let's just go.

296
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,820
Come on.

297
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,420
Okay.

298
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,960
Okay. You can wait here.

299
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,260
Gavin, no.

300
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,550
I'm just gonna be a minute.

301
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,830
Nothing's gonna get you, I promise.

302
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,040
Damn it.

303
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,160
Hey, sweetie,
couldn't take it, huh?

304
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,220
Hey.

305
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,070
Gavin, where are you?

306
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,390
Gavin.

307
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,720
Getting readings?

308
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,170
No, big-time.

309
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,320
This place is orbing like crazy.

310
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,190
There's probably
multiple spirits out and about.

311
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,580
And if these unrecovered bodies
are causing the haunting?

312
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,880
We got to find them and burn them.

313
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,650
Just be careful.

314
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,530
The only thing that makes me
more nervous than a pissed-off spirit

315
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,680
is a pissed-off spirit of a psycho killer.

316
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,310
Dean!

317
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,610
Dean!

318
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,190
Shotgun!

319
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,610
Sam, get down!

320
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,380
That was weird.

321
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,230
Yeah,

322
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,490
you're telling me.

323
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,020
No, Dean, I mean, it was weird
that she didn't attack me.

324
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,890
It looked pretty aggro from where I was standing.

325
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,100
She didn't hurt me.

326
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,320
She didn't even try.

327
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,990
So she didn't want to hurt me,
then what did she want?

328
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,640
It's all right.We're not going to hurt you.

329
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,470
It's okay.

330
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,010
What's your name?

331
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:01,780
Katherine.

332
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,890
Kat.

333
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:04,780
Okay.

334
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,040
I'm dean.This is sam.

335
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,250
What are you doing here?

336
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,290
My boyfriend, Gavin...

337
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,590
is he here?

338
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,250
Somewhere.

339
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,730
He thought it would be fun,
try and see some ghosts.

340
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,200
I thought it was all just...

341
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,020
you know...

342
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,810
pretend.

343
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,770
I've seen things.

344
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,100
I heard Gavin scream, and...

345
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,800
All right, Kat, come on.

346
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,980
Sam's gonna get you out of here.
Then we're gonna find your boyfriend.

347
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,610
No, no.

348
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,080
I'm not gonna leave without Gavin.

349
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,580
I'm coming with you.

350
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,570
It's no a joke around here, okay.
It's dangerous.

351
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,310
That's why I've got to find him.

352
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,550
All right, I guess we're gonna split up, then.

353
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,690
Let's go.

354
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,910
Gavin!

355
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,370
Gavin!

356
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,380
Gavin!

357
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:04,910
Gavin!

358
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,610
I've got a question for you.

359
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,840
You've seen a lot of horror movies, yeah?

360
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,850
I guess so.

361
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,680
Do me a favor.
Next time you see one,

362
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,850
pay attention.

363
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,840
When someone says a place is haunted,

364
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,170
don't go in.

365
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,250
Gavin?

366
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,950
Hey, gavin.

367
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,870
Hey, it's okay. It's okay. I'm here to help.

368
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,250
Who are you?

369
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,540
My name is Sam.

370
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,330
We found your girlfriend.

371
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,660
- Kat?
- Yeah.

372
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,800
Is she all right?

373
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,150
She's worried about you. Are you okay?

374
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,390
I was running. I, uh,

375
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,520
I think I fell.

376
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,860
You were running from what?

377
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,780
There was...

378
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,980
There was this girl. Her-her face...

379
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,610
it was all messed up.

380
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,630
Okay, listen, listen,

381
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,570
this girl, did she try to hurt you?

382
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,170
What? No, she, uh...

383
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,190
she what?

384
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,500
She kissed me.

385
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,650
Um, but she didn't hurt you physically?

386
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,720
Dude, she kissed me.

387
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,500
I'm scarred for life.

388
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,290
[ Chuckles ] Trust me, it could have been worse.

389
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,910
And now, do you remember anything else?

390
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,450
She, uh...

391
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,170
Actually, she tried to whisper something in my ear.

392
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,630
What?

393
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,940
I don't know. I ran like hell.

394
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,070
You son of a bitch.

395
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,660
It's all right. I've got a lighter.

396
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,600
Ow. You're hurting my arm.

397
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,260
What are you talking about?

398
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:06,420
Let me out!Please!

399
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,320
Kat, hang on!

400
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,130
What's going on?

401
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,220
She's inside with one of them.

402
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,440
Help me!

403
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,250
Kat!

404
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,470
Get me out of here!

405
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,340
Kat, it's not gonna hurt you.

406
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,420
Listen to me. You have to face it.
You have to calm down.

407
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,520
She's got to what?

408
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,410
I have to what?

409
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:55,170
These spirits, they don't try to hurt, they're trying to communicate.

410
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,750
You've got to listen to. You've got to face it.

411
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,650
You face it.

412
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,230
No. It's the only way you're gonna get out of there.

413
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,000
No!

414
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,140
Look at it.That's all.

415
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,520
Come on.You can do it.

416
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,230
Kat?

417
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,640
Now, I hope you're right about this.

418
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,760
Yeah, me, too.

419
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,520
Oh, Kat.

420
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,930
1, 3, 7.

421
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,680
Sorry?

422
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,560
It whispered in my ear

423
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,060
1, 3, 7.

424
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,460
Room number.

425
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,140
All right. So if these spirits aren't trying to hurt anyone.

426
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,680
then what are they trying to do?

427
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,220
Maybe that's what they've been trying to tell us.

428
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,360
I guess we'll find out.

429
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:07,940
All right.

430
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,350
So,

431
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,500
now, you guys ready to leave this place?

432
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,210
That's an understatement.

433
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,220
Okay.

434
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,010
You get them out of here.

435
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,870
I'm gonna gofind room 137.

436
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,400
So, how do you guys know about all this ghost stuff?

437
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,410
It's kind of our job.

438
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,330
Why would anyone want a job like that?

439
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,750
I had a crappy guidance counselor.

440
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,090
And Dean? He's your boss?

441
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,220
No.

442
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,130
All right.

443
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,960
I think we have a small problem.

444
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,540
Let's break it down.

445
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,680
I don't think that's gonna work.

446
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,650
Then a window.

447
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,300
They're barred.

448
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,970
How are we supposed to get out?

449
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,580
That's the point. We're not.

450
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,410
There's something in here.

451
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,710
It doesn't want us to leave.

452
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,830
Those patients.

453
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:51,800
No.

454
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,400
Something else.

455
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,880
This is why I get paid the big bucks.

456
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,540
"Patients journal."

457
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,820
All work and no play makes Dr. Ellicott,

458
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,880
a very dull boy.

459
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,320
Right. I've looked everywhere.

460
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,660
There's no other way out.

461
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,000
So, what the hell are we gonna do?

462
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,580
For starters, we're not gonna panic.

463
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,710
Why the hell not?

464
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:07,800
Hey.

465
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,850
Sam, it's me.

466
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,960
I see it. It's coming at me.

467
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,970
Where are you?

468
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,020
I'm in the basement. Hurry up!

469
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,920
I'm on my way.

470
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,180
All right. Can either of you handle a shotgun?

471
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,520
What?! No!

472
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:18,660
I can.

473
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,060
My dad took me skeet shooting a couple times.

474
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,910
Oh, I heard.

475
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,050
It's loaded with rock salt.

476
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,020
Now, it might not kill a spirit,

477
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,560
but it will repel it, so if you see something,

478
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,170
shoot.

479
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:27,820
Okay.

480
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,670
Okay.

481
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,960
Dean!

482
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,850
Dean!

483
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,040
Dean?

484
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,040
Don't be afraid.

485
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,860
I'm going to make you all better.

486
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,970
Hey, Gavin.

487
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,320
Yeah?

488
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,680
If we make it out of here alive,

489
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,320
we are so breaking up.

490
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,700
Did you hear that?

491
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,870
Something's coming.

492
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,820
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

493
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,680
Don't shoot! It's me!

494
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,540
Sorry. Sorry.

495
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,330
Son of a...

496
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,760
what are you still doing here?

497
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,970
Where's Sam?

498
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,680
He went to the basement. You called him.

499
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,260
I didn't call him.

500
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,470
His cellphone rang.

501
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,690
He said it was you.

502
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,650
Basement, huh?

503
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,630
All right.

504
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,700
Watch yourselves.

505
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:22,860
And watch out for me.

506
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,710
Sammy?

507
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,590
Sam, you down here?

508
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,250
Sam!

509
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,570
Sam!

510
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,530
Man...

511
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,880
Answer me when I'm calling you.

512
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:43,980
You all right?

513
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,030
Yeah, I'm fine.

514
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,530
You know that wasn't me who called, right?

515
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,560
Yeah, I know. I think something lured me down here.

516
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,890
I think I know who

517
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,910
Dr. Ellicott.

518
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,500
That's what the spirits have been trying to tell us.
You haven't seen him, have you?

519
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,390
No.

520
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,490
How do you knowit was him?

521
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,780
Because I found his logbook.

522
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,300
Apparently, he was experimenting on his patients.

523
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,880
Awful stuff.

524
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,540
Makes lobotomies look like a couple of aspirin.

525
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,120
But it was the patients who rioted.

526
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,820
Yeah. They were rioting against Dr. Ellicott.

527
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,400
Dr. Feelgood was working on some
sort of extreme-rage therapy.

528
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,670
He thought if he could get his
patients to vent their anger,

529
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,050
then they'd be cured of it.

530
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,670
Instead it only made them worse and worse

531
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,890
and angrier and angrier.

532
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,510
I'm thinking, what if his spirit

533
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,890
is doing the same thing?

534
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,860
To the cop,

535
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,320
the kids in the '70s

536
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,910
making them so angry they become homicidal.

537
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,610
Come on.

538
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,520
We've got to find his bones and torch them.

539
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,810
How?

540
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,440
The police never found his body.

541
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,110
The logbook said he had some
hidden procedure room down here

542
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,220
Somewhere where he'd work
on his patients. So,

543
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,080
if I was a patient,
I'd drag his ass down here

544
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,420
do a little work on myself.

545
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,840
I don't know.It sounds kind of...

546
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,610
Of crazy?

547
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,310
Yeah.

548
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,730
Yeah, exactly.

549
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,500
I told you I looked everywhere.

550
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,160
I didn't find a hidden room.

551
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,060
Well, that's why they call it hidden.

552
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,950
You hear that?

553
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,220
What?

554
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,960
There's a door here.

555
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,140
Dean.

556
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,940
Step back from the door.

557
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,060
Sam, put the gun down.

558
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,560
Is that an order?

559
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,800
That's more of a friendly request.

560
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,020
'Cause I'm getting pretty tired
of taking your orders.

561
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,700
I knew it.

562
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,400
Ellicott did something to you, didn't he?

563
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,570
For once in your life,

564
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,870
shut your mouth.

565
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,210
What are you gonna do, sam?

566
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,430
The gun's filled with rock salt.

567
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,610
It's not gonna kill me.

568
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,500
No.

569
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,670
But it'll hurt like hell.

570
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,180
Sam.

571
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,320
We've got to burn Ellicott's bones,

572
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,700
and all this will be over,

573
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,240
and you'll be back to normal.

574
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,420
I am normal.

575
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,010
I'm just telling the truth for the first time.

576
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,150
I mean, why are we even here?

577
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,560
'Cause you're following dad's orders
like a good little soldier?

578
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,070
'Cause you always do
what he says without question?

579
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,300
Are you that desperate for his approval?

580
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,920
This isn't you talking, Sam.

581
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,540
That's the difference between you and me.

582
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,560
I have a mind of my own.

583
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,500
I'm not pathetic like you.

584
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,530
So what are you gonna do? Huh. You gonna kill me?

585
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,450
We're no closer to finding dad today

586
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,450
You know, I am sick of doing what you tell me to do.

587
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,760
We're no closer to finding dad today

588
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,620
than we were six months ago.

589
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,700
Well, then here.

590
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,720
Let me make it easier for you.

591
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,800
Come on.

592
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,890
Take it.

593
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,010
Real bullets are gonna work
a hell of a lot better than rock salt.

594
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,920
Take it.

595
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,920
You hate me that much?

596
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,280
You think you can kill your own brother?

597
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,370
Then go ahead.

598
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,760
Pull the trigger.

599
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,130
Do it!

600
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,450
Man, I'm not gonna give you a loaded pistol.

601
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,920
Sorry, Sammy.

602
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,940
Oh, that's just gross.

603
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:11,780
Soak it up.

604
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,680
Don't be afraid.

605
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,820
I'm going to help you.

606
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,730
I'm going to make you all better.

607
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,250
You're not gonna try and kill me, are you?

608
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,850
No.

609
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,520
Good.

610
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,750
'Cause that would be awkward.

611
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,880
Thanks, guys.

612
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,340
Yeah, thanks.

613
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,730
No more haunted asylums, okay?

614
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,870
Hey, Dean.

615
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,790
I' sorry, man. I...

616
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,790
...said some awful thingsback there.

617
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,570
You remember all that?

618
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:57,780
Yeah.

619
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,240
It's like I couldn't control it, but I didn't mean it

620
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,580
any of it.

621
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,160
You didn't, huh?

622
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,140
No. Of course, not.

623
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,470
Do we need to talk about this?

624
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,300
No.

625
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,090
I'm not really in the sharing and caring kind of mood.

626
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,200
I just want to get some sleep.

627
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,870
Dean.

628
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,140
Hello.

629
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:45,740
Dad?
