1
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,560
Now I lay me down to sleep.

2
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,140
I pray the lord my soul to keep.

3
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,610
Thy angels watch me
through the night

4
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,040
and keep me safe
till morning light.

5
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,430
Amen.

6
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,730
Amen.

7
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,870
Night, monkeypuss.

8
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,580
Daddy ?

9
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,220
Is mommy coming home ?

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,310
No, honey.

11
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,860
She's spending the night at
the hospital with your sister.

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,240
Hey.

13
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,100
You sleep tight now.

14
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,270
Yeah, you probably missed something.
That's why.

15
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,310
Dude, I ran lexisnexis,
local police reports, newspapers.

16
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,140
I couldn't find a single red flag.

17
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,010
Are you sure you got
the coordinates right ?

18
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,470
Yeah, I double-checked.
It's Fitchburg, Wisconsin.

19
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,430
Dad wouldn't have sent us coordinates
if it wasn't important, Sammy.

20
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,740
Well, I'm telling you, I looked,
and all I could find was a big, steamy pile of nothing.

21
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,220
If dad's sending us hunting for something,
I don't know what.

22
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,180
Well, maybe he's gonna
meet us there.

23
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,870
Yeah, 'cause he's been so easy
to find up to this point.

24
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,040
You're a real smartass,
you know that ?

25
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,310
Don't worry. I'm sure there's something
in Fitchburg worth killing.

26
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,490
Yeah ?
What makes you so sure ?

27
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,360
Because I'm the oldest,
which means I'm always right.

28
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,460
No, it doesn't.

29
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,710
It totally does.

30
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,950
Well,

31
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,740
that the local freemasons are up
to something sneaky, but...

32
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,170
other than that, nobody's heard
about anything weird going on.

33
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,240
Dean, you got the time ?

34
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,050
10 after 4:00.

35
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,860
Why ?

36
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,180
What's wrong with this picture ?

37
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,260
School's out, isn't it ?

38
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,580
Yeah.

39
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,460
So where is everybody ?

40
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,300
This place should be crawling
with kids right now.

41
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,240
It sure is quiet out here.

42
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,980
Yeah, it's a shame.

43
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,910
Why is that ?

44
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,140
You know, kids getting sick.
It's a terrible thing.

45
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,270
How many ?

46
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,580
Just five or six,
but serious, hospital serious.

47
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,210
A lot of parents are getting
pretty anxious.

48
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,930
They think it's catching.

49
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,090
Dude, dude,
I am not using this I.D.

50
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,820
Why not ?

51
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,010
Because it says
"bikini inspector" on it.

52
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,300
Don't worry. She won't look that close.
Hell, she won't even ask to see it.

53
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,120
It's all about confidence, Sammy.

54
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,430
Hi. I'm Dr. Jerry Kaplan,
in the center for disease control.

55
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,710
Can I see some I.D. ?

56
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,110
Yeah, of course.

57
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,370
Now, could you direct me
to the pediatrics ward, please ?

58
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,350
Okay, just go down that hall,
turn left, up the stairs.

59
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,890
See ? Told you it would work.

60
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,660
Follow me. It's upstairs.

61
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,820
Dean.

62
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,760
Thanks for seeing us, Dr. Hydaker.

63
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,270
Oh, I'm glad you guys are here.

64
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,100
I was just about to call the CDC myself.

65
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,910
How did you find out anyway ?

66
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,670
Oh, some G.P... I forget his name...
He called Atlanta and...

67
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,140
must have beat you to the punch.

68
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,290
So you say you got six cases
so far ?

69
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,060
Yeah, in five weeks.

70
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,520
At first I thought it was bacterial pneumonia,
not that newsworthy.

71
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,020
But now...

72
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,250
Now, what ?

73
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,530
The kids aren't responding
to antibiotics.

74
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,460
Their white-cell counts
keep going down.

75
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,580
Their immune systems
just aren't doing their job.

76
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,960
It's like their bodies are...

77
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,890
- wearing out.
- Excuse me, Dr. Hydaker.

78
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,600
You ever see anything
like this before ?

79
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,350
Never this severe.

80
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,240
The way it spreads...
That's a new one for me.

81
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,080
What do you mean ?

82
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,130
It works its way through families,

83
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,200
but only the children,
one sibling after another.

84
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,420
You mind if we interview
a few of the kids ?

85
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,430
They're not conscious.

86
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,470
None of them ?

87
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,530
No.

88
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,500
Can we talk to the parents ?

89
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,640
If you think it'll help.

90
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,720
Yeah, yeah. Who was your most
recent admission ?

91
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,060
I should get back to my girls.

92
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,490
We understand that,

93
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,640
and we really appreciate
you talking to us.

94
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,250
Now, you say Mary's the oldest ?

95
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,510
13.

96
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,660
Okay, and she came down
with it first, right ? And then...

97
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,400
Bethany, the next night.

98
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,060
Within 24 hours ?

99
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,770
I guess.

100
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,170
Look, I already went through
all this with the doctor.

101
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,100
Right. Just a few more
questions, if you don't mind.

102
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,160
How do you think
they caught pneumonia ?

103
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,310
Were they out in the cold,
anything like that ?

104
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,270
- No, we think it was an open window.
- Both times ?

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,210
The first time, I don't...

106
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,250
I don't really remember, but the second time
for sure, and...

107
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,030
- I know I closed it before I put Bethany to bed.
- So you think she opened it ?

108
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,730
It's a second-story window, no ledge.

109
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,620
No one else could have.

110
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,120
You know this might not be
anything supernatural.

111
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,410
- It might just be pneumonia.
- Maybe.

112
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,550
Or maybe something opened that window.

113
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,220
I don't know, man. Look, dad
sent us down here for a reason.

114
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,820
- I think we might be barking up the right tree.
- I'll tell you one thing.

115
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,680
What ?

116
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,030
That guy we just talked to...

117
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,550
I'm betting it'll be a while
before he goes home.

118
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,320
You got anything over there ?

119
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,820
No, nothing.

120
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,610
Yeah, me neither.

121
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,430
Hey, Dean.

122
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,830
Yeah ?

123
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,740
You were right.

124
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,720
It's not pneumonia.

125
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,650
It's rotted.

126
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
What the hell leaves a handprint like that ?

127
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,680
All right.

128
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,650
You know the drill, Dean.

129
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,850
If anyone calls,

130
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,610
you don't pick up.

131
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,780
If it's me,

132
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,860
I'll ring once and then call back.

133
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,260
You got that ?

134
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,120
Don't answer the phone unless
it rings once first.

135
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,080
Come on, dude. Look alive.
This stuff's important.

136
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,470
I know, it's just, we've done it
like a million times,

137
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,940
and you know I'm not stupid.

138
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,660
I know you're not,

139
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,880
but it only takes one mistake.
You got that ?

140
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,400
All right, if I'm not back sunday night...

141
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,880
Call pastor Jim.

142
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,840
Lock the doors

143
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,680
and windows, close the shades,

144
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,020
- and most important...
- Watch out for Sammy.

145
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,650
I know.

146
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,450
All right, if something tries to bust in...

147
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,170
Shoot first, ask questions later.

148
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,400
That's my man.

149
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,750
I know why dad sent us here.

150
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,020
He's faced this thing before.

151
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,170
He wants us to finish the job.

152
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,920
So what the hell is a shtriga ?

153
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,950
It's kind of like a witch, I think.
I don't know much about them.

154
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,810
Well, I've never heard of it, and
it's not in dad's journal.

155
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,470
Dad hunted one in Fort Douglas, Wisconsin,
about 16, 17 years ago.

156
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,470
- You were there. You don't remember ?
- No.

157
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,510
I guess he caught wind that the thing's in Fitchburg now
and kicked us the coordinates.

158
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,760
So wait, this...

159
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,510
Shtriga.

160
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,520
Right, you think it's the same
one dad hunted before ?

161
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,900
Yeah, maybe.

162
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,300
If dad went after it,
why is it still breathing air ?

163
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,300
Because it got away.

164
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,190
Got away ?

165
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,240
- Yeah, Sammy, it happens.
- Not very often.

166
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,020
I don't know what to tell you. Maybe dad
didn't have his wheaties that morning.

167
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,080
- What else do you remember ?
- Nothing. I was a kid, all right ?

168
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,650
King or two queens ?

169
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,470
Two queens.

170
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,850
Yeah, I bet.

171
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,670
- What'd you say ?
- Nice car.

172
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

173
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,130
- Checking in ?
- Yeah.

174
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,560
Uh, do me a favor. Go get your brother
some dinner.

175
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,250
I'm helping a guest.

176
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,830
Two queens.

177
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,920
Funny kid.

178
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,490
Oh, yeah, he thinks so.

179
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,180
Will that be cash or credit ?

180
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,350
Do you take mastercard ?

181
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,270
Perfect.

182
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:58,970
There you go.

183
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,020
When's dad gonna get back ?

184
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,500
Tomorrow.

185
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:20,750
When ?

186
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,420
I don't know. He usually comes in late,
though.

187
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,360
Now, eat your dinner.

188
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,510
I'm sick of "scabetti-os."

189
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,010
You're the one who wanted them.

190
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,540
I want lucky charms.

191
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,580
- There's no more lucky charms.
- I saw the box.

192
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,370
Okay, maybe there is,

193
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,540
but there's only enough left for one bowl
and I haven't had any yet.

194
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,460
Do you want the prize ?

195
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,660
Sir ?

196
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,090
Thanks.

197
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,980
Well,

198
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,120
you were right.

199
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,210
It wasn't very easy to find,

200
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,640
but you were right. A shtriga is
a kind of witch.

201
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,300
They're albanian, but legends about them
date back to ancient Rome.

202
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,870
They feed off of "spiritus vitae".

203
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,150
- Spirit what ?
- Vitae.

204
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,860
It's latin. It translates
to "breath of life",

205
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,970
kind of like your

206
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,700
life force or essence.

207
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,960
Didn't the doctor say the kids' bodies
were wearing out ?

208
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,250
It's a thought.

209
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,330
You know, she takes your vitality,
maybe your immunity goes to hell,

210
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,590
pneumonia takes hold.

211
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,960
Anyway, shtrigas can feed off
anyone, but they prefer...

212
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,710
children.

213
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,360
Yeah.

214
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,430
Probably because they have stronger
life force. And get this...

215
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,510
Shtrigas are invulnerable to all weapons
devised by god and man.

216
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,150
No, that's not right.

217
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,450
She's vulnerable when she feeds.

218
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,940
What ?

219
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,220
If you catch her when she's eating,

220
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,000
you can blast her with consecrated wrought irons,
buckshots or rounds I think.

221
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,560
How do you know that ?

222
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,600
Dad told me. I remember.

223
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,480
Oh.

224
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,910
So, uh,

225
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,570
anything else dad might have mentioned ?

226
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,530
No, that's it.

227
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,520
What ?

228
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,090
Nothing.

229
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,910
Okay,

230
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,420
so, assuming we can kill it when it eats,
we've still got to find the thing first,

231
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,870
which ain't gonna be a cakewalk.

232
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,440
Shtrigas take on a human disguise when
they're not hunting.

233
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,760
What kind of human disguise ?

234
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,440
Historically, something innocuous.

235
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,880
It could be anything, but it's usually
a feeble old woman, which may be how

236
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,780
- the witches-as-old-crones legend got started.
- Hang on.

237
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,040
What ?

238
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:01,990
Check this out.

239
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,730
I marked down all the addresses
of the victims.

240
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,600
Now, these are the houses
that have been hit so far,

241
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,690
and dead center...

242
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,570
- the hospital.
- the hospital.

243
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,080
When we were there,
I saw a patient, an old woman.

244
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,400
An old person, huh ?

245
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,780
- Yeah.
- In the hospital ?

246
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,630
Better call the coast guard.

247
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,080
Well, listen, smartass, she had an inverted cross
hanging on her wall.

248
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,850
- Good night, Dr. Hydaker.
- See you tomorrow, Betty.

249
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,050
Try to get some sleep.

250
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,150
Who the hell are you ?

251
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,490
Who's there ?

252
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,850
You trying to steal my stuff ?

253
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,070
They're always stealing around here.

254
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,950
No, ma'am, we're maintenance.
We're sorry.

255
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,350
We thought you were sleeping.

256
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,170
Ah, nonsense. I was sleeping
with my peepers open.

257
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,870
And fix that crucifix, would you ?

258
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,130
I've asked four damn times already.

259
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,250
"I was sleeping with my peepers open".

260
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,140
I almost smoked that old gal,
I swear.

261
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,350
It's not funny.

262
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,960
Oh, man, you should have seen
your face, Dean.

263
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,510
Oh, yeah, laugh it on, man.
We're back to square one.

264
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,440
Hang on.

265
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,830
Hey, what's wrong ?

266
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,480
My brother's sick.

267
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,100
The little guy ?

268
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,030
Pneumonia.

269
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,600
He's in the hospital.

270
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,700
It's my fault.

271
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,830
No, come on. How ?

272
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,710
I should have made sure the window
was latched.

273
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,070
He wouldn't have gotten pneumonia
if the window was latched.

274
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,250
Listen to me.

275
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,990
I can promise you

276
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,200
that this is not your fault, okay ?

277
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,530
It's my job to look after him.

278
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,950
Michael.

279
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,140
Well, turn on the "no vacancy" sign
while I'm gone.

280
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,990
I've got Denise covering room service,
so don't bother with the rooms.

281
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,440
- I'm going with you.
- Not now, Michael.

282
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,560
- But I got to see Asher.
- Hey, Michael.

283
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,440
Hey.

284
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,020
I know how you feel. I'm a big brother, too.
But you got to go easy on your mom right now, okay ?

285
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,290
- Damn it.
- I got it.

286
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,070
Thanks.

287
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,910
You're in no condition to drive.

288
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,400
Why don't you let me give you
a lift to the hospital ?

289
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,890
- No, no, I couldn't possibly...
- No, it's no trouble. I insist.

290
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,060
Thanks.

291
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,180
Be good.

292
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,140
We're gonna kill this thing.
I want it dead. You hear me ?

293
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,190
- Hey.
- Hey, how's the kid ?

294
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,730
He's not good. Where you at ?

295
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,570
I'm at the library, trying to find out as much
as I can about this shtriga.

296
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,140
Yeah, what do you got ?

297
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,180
Well, bad news.

298
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,700
I started with Fort Douglas
around the time you said dad was there.

299
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,620
And ?

300
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,840
Same deal. Before that,
there was Ogdenville.

301
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:53,000
Before that, north Haverbrook and Brockway.

302
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,960
Every 15 to 20 years, it hits a new town.

303
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,000
Dean, this thing is just getting
started in Fitchburg.

304
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,980
In all these other places, it goes on
for months, dozens of kids,

305
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,800
before the shtriga finally moves on.

306
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,780
Kids just...

307
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,240
languish in comas, and then they die.

308
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,640
How far back does this thing go ?

309
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,220
I don't know.

310
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,960
The earliest mention I could find is this place
called Black River Falls, back in the 1890s.

311
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,450
Talk about a horror show.

312
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,730
- Sam ?
- Hold on.

313
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,220
I'm looking at a photograph right now
of a bunch of doctors standing around a kid's bed.

314
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,910
One of the doctors...

315
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,280
is Hydaker.

316
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:35,720
And ?

317
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,080
And this picture was taken in 1893.

318
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,680
You sure ?

319
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,600
Yeah.

320
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,480
Yeah, absolutely.

321
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,430
Don't worry.

322
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,530
Your son's in good hands.

323
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,930
I'm gonna take care of him.

324
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,450
So what's the CDC come up
with so far ?

325
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,920
We're still working on a few theories.

326
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,920
You'll know something as soon as
we do.

327
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,010
Well, nothing's more important
to me than these kids.

328
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,370
Just let me know if I can help.

329
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,550
I'll do that.

330
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,580
We should have thought of this before.

331
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,040
Doctor's a perfect disguise. You're trusted.
You can control the whole thing.

332
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,090
That son of a bitch.

333
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,650
I'm surprised you didn't draw
on him right there.

334
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,070
Yeah, well...

335
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,110
First of all,

336
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,200
I'm not gonna open fire
in a freakin' pediatrics ward.

337
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,000
Good call.

338
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,560
Second, it wouldn't have done
any good because

339
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,240
the bastard's bulletproof unless
he's chowing down on something.

340
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,320
And third,

341
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,300
I wasn't packing, which is probably
a really good thing 'cause

342
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,870
I probably would have just burned
a clip in him off of principle alone.

343
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,160
You're getting wise
in your old age, Dean.

344
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,230
You're damn right.

345
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,040
'Cause now I know
how we're gonna get it.

346
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,020
What do you mean ?

347
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,680
The shtriga...
it works through siblings, right ?

348
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,540
Right.

349
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,110
Well, last night...

350
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,230
it went after Asher.

351
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,260
So tonight, it's probably gonna come
after Michael.

352
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,490
Then we got to get him
out of here.

353
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,370
No.

354
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,740
No, that would blow the whole deal.

355
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,820
- What ?
- Yeah.

356
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,440
Then you want to use
the kid as bait ?

357
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,500
Are you nuts ?

358
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,370
No.

359
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,560
- No. forget it. That's out of the question.
- That's not out of the question, Sam.

360
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,250
It's the only way...
If this thing disappears,

361
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,920
it could be years
before we get another chance.

362
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:32,890
Michael's a kid,

363
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,450
and I'm not gonna dangle him in front of
that thing like a worm on a hook.

364
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,150
Dad did not send me here
to walk away.

365
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,660
Send you here ? He didn't send you here.
He sent us here.

366
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,420
This isn't about you, Sam.

367
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,640
I'm the one that screwed up.
It's my fault.

368
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,780
There's no telling how many kids have gotten
hurt because of me.

369
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,080
What are you saying, Dean ?

370
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,210
How is it your fault ?

371
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,410
Dean.

372
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,110
You've been hiding something
from the get-go.

373
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,890
Since when does dad bail on a hunt ?

374
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,180
Since when does
he let something get away ?

375
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,770
Now, talk to me, man.

376
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,290
Tell me what's going on.

377
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,440
Fort Douglas, Wisconsin.

378
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,060
It was...

379
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,050
the third night in this... crap room, and I was
climbing the walls, man. I needed to get some air.

380
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,980
Hey, kid.

381
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,210
We're closing up.

382
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,940
Get out of the way !

383
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:15,670
Sammy.

384
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,730
Sammy.

385
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,810
Sammy.

386
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,470
You okay ?

387
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,010
Dad, what's going on ?

388
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,490
Are you all right ?

389
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,060
What happened ?

390
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,700
I... I just went out.

391
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,740
What ?

392
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,530
Just for a second. I'm sorry.

393
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,890
I told you not to leave this room.

394
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:43,000
I told you not to let him
out of your sight.

395
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,300
Dad just...

396
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,550
grabbed us and booked,

397
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,390
dropped us off at pastor Jim's
about three hours away.

398
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,340
By the time he got back to...

399
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,860
Fort Douglas, the shtriga had disappeared.
It was...

400
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,930
just gone.

401
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,410
It never resurfaced until now.

402
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,060
Dad never spoke about it again.

403
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,700
I didn't ask.

404
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,200
But he, uh...

405
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,990
He looked at me different,

406
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,280
you know,

407
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,510
which was worse.

408
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,980
Not that I blame him.

409
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,680
He gave me an order, and I didn't listen,
and I almost got you killed.

410
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,030
- You were just a kid.
- Don't.

411
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:43,670
Don't.

412
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,120
Dad knew this was
unfinished business for me.

413
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,110
He sent me here to finish it.

414
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,570
But using Michael...

415
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,220
I don't know, Dean.

416
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,780
I mean,

417
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,820
how about one of us hides under the cover ?
You know, we'll be the bait.

418
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,680
No, that won't work.

419
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,640
It's got to get close enough
to feed. It'll see us.

420
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,920
Believe me, I don't like it, but
it's got to be the kid.

421
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,130
You're crazy ! Just...

422
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,700
- go away or I'm calling the cops.
- Hang on a second.

423
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,890
Just listen to me.

424
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,920
You have to believe me, okay ?

425
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,090
This thing came through the window
and then attacked your brother.

426
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,150
I've seen it.

427
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,920
I know what it looks like

428
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,190
'cause it attacked my brother once, too.

429
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,770
This thing...

430
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,050
is it, like...

431
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,620
it has this long,

432
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,910
black robe ?

433
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,610
You saw it last night, didn't you ?

434
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,290
I thought I was having a nightmare.

435
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,680
I'd give anything not to tell you this,

436
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,660
but sometimes nightmares are real.

437
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:10,110
So... why are you telling me ?

438
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,500
Because we need your help.

439
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,140
My help ?

440
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,450
We can kill it,

441
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,590
me and him. It's what we do.

442
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,260
But we can't do it without you.

443
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,390
What ?

444
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,940
- No.
- Michael, listen to me.

445
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,410
This thing hurt Asher,

446
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:30,640
and it's gonna keep hurting kids
unless we stop it. Do you understand me ?

447
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,130
Well, that went crappy.

448
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,310
Now what ?

449
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,760
What did you expect ?

450
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,120
You can't ask an adult to do something
like that, much less a kid.

451
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,450
If you kill it, will Asher get better ?

452
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,230
Honestly ?

453
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,180
We don't know.

454
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,430
You said you're a big brother.

455
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:07,450
Yeah.

456
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,000
You'd take care of your little brother ?

457
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,020
You'd do anything for him ?

458
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,020
Yeah, I would.

459
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,730
Me too.

460
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,770
I'll help.

461
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:47,140
This camera has night vision on it,
so we'll be able to see you as clear as day.

462
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,140
Are we good ?

463
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,570
Hair to the right.

464
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,040
There, there.

465
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,040
What do I do ?

466
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,250
Just stay under the covers.

467
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,740
And if it shows up ?

468
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,300
Well, we'll be right in the next room.

469
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,650
We're gonna come in with guns,

470
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,320
so as soon as we do, you roll off this bed
and you crawl under it.

471
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,660
What if you shoot me ?

472
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,250
We won't shoot you. We're good shots.

473
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,480
We're not gonna fire
until you're clear, okay ?

474
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,180
Have you heard a gunshot before ?

475
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,770
Like in the movies ?

476
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,140
It's gonna be a lot louder
than in the movies.

477
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,850
So I want you to stay under the bed,

478
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,520
cover your ears, and do not come out until
we say so, you understand ?

479
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,870
Michael, are you sure you want
to do this ?

480
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,340
You don't have to. It's okay.
I won't be mad.

481
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,760
No, I'm okay.

482
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,220
Just don't shoot me.

483
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,620
We're not gonna let anything
happen to you.

484
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,180
I promise.

485
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,620
What time is it ?

486
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,310
3:00.

487
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,020
You sure these iron rounds
are gonna work ?

488
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,920
Consecrated iron rounds. And yeah,
it's what dad used last time.

489
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,950
Hey, Dean, I'm sorry.

490
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:23,940
For what ?

491
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,000
You know...

492
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,250
I've really given you a lot of crap

493
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:33,150
for always following dad's orders.

494
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,290
But I know why you do it.

495
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,200
Oh, god. Kill me now.

496
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,500
Wait, look.

497
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,060
- Now ?
- Not yet.

498
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,860
Michael, down !

499
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,320
- Mike, you all right ?
- Yeah.

500
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,410
Just sit tight.

501
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,240
Dean !

502
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,430
You okay, little brother ?

503
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,150
It's okay, Michael.
You can come on out.

504
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,070
Hey, Joanna, how's Asher doing ?

505
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,180
- Have you seen Michael ?
- Mom ! Mom !

506
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,230
- How's Ash ?
- I've got some good news.

507
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,430
Your brother's gonna be fine.

508
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,060
- Really ?
- Yeah, really.

509
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,270
No one can explain it. It's, uh,

510
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,360
it's a miracle.

511
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,880
They're gonna keep him in overnight for observation,
but after that, he's coming home.

512
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,840
That's great.

513
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,840
- How are all the other kids doing ?
- Good, real good.

514
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,830
A bunch of them should be checking out
in a few days.

515
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,780
Dr. Travis says the ward's gonna be like
a ghost town.

516
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,100
Dr. Travis ?

517
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,820
What about Dr. Hydaker ?

518
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,340
Oh, he wasn't in today.

519
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,830
He must have been sick
or something.

520
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,890
Yeah, he must have.

521
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,840
So did anything happen while I was gone ?

522
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,970
No, same old stuff.

523
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,000
You can go see Ash.

524
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,670
- Now ?
- Only if you want to.

525
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,060
I better get going before he hot-wires
the car and drives himself.

526
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,550
It's too bad.

527
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,900
No, they'll be fine.

528
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,830
That's not what I meant.

529
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,070
I meant Michael.

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,790
He'll always know there are things out there in the dark.
He'll never be the same, you know ?

531
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,790
Sometimes I just wish that...

532
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,350
What ?

533
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,770
I wish I could have
that kind of innocence.

534
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,560
If it means anything,
sometimes I wish you could, too.
