1
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,200
Mommy?

2
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,630
Hey, sweetie.

3
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,680
- Why aren't you in bed?
- There's something in my closet.

4
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,600
See?

5
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,860
There's nothing there.

6
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,980
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

7
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,910
Now, come on.

8
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,970
Into bed.

9
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,650
I don't like this house.

10
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,760
You're just not used to it yet.

11
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,140
But you and your brother and me,
we are going to be very happy here.

12
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,630
I promise.

13
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,700
I love you.

14
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,880
The chair.

15
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,080
Okay.

16
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,630
Right.

17
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,340
The chair.

18
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,470
Just to be safe.

19
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,690
Please, god, don't let it be rats.

20
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,720
Terrific.

21
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,460
All right.

22
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,190
I've been cruising some websites.

23
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,580
Think I found a few candidates
for our next gig.

24
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,470
A fishing trawler found off
the coast of Cali.

25
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,930
Its crew vanished.

26
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,480
And we got some cattle
mutilations in west Texas.

27
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,530
Hey!

28
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,260
Am I boring you
with this hunting-evil stuff?

29
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,760
No, I'm listening. Keep going.

30
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,330
And here a Sacramento man
shot himself in the head...

31
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,930
three times.

32
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,220
Any of these things
blowing up your skirt, pal?

33
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,020
- Wait, I've seen this.
- Seen what?

34
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,630
What are you doing?

35
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,280
Dean, I know
where we have to go next.

36
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:56,960
Where?

37
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,460
Back home.

38
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,220
Back to Kansas.

39
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,370
Okay, random.
Where'd that come from?

40
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,200
All right, um...

41
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,480
this photo was taken in front
of our old house, right?

42
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,730
The house where mom died?

43
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,750
Yeah.

44
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,880
It didn't burn down right?
I mean not completely, they rebuilt it, right?

45
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,220
I guess so, yeah. What the hell
are you talking about?

46
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,390
Okay, look,
this is gonna sound crazy,

47
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,420
but the people who live in our old house,

48
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,230
I think they might be in danger.

49
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,850
- Why would you think that?
- Uh...

50
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,860
just, um...
look, just...

51
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,190
You got to trust me on this, okay?

52
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,760
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Trust you?
- Yeah.

53
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,090
You got to give me
a little bit more than that.

54
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,810
I can't really explain,
it is all.

55
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,440
Well, tough. I'm not going
anywhere until you do.

56
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,580
I have these nightmares.

57
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,220
I've noticed.

58
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,830
And sometimes they come true.

59
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,750
Come again?

60
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,240
Look, Dean...

61
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,800
I dreamt about Jessica's death

62
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,420
for days before it happened.

63
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,570
Sane people have weird dreams, man.
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

64
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,120
No, I dreamt about the blood dripping,
her on the ceiling, the fire, everything,

65
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,930
and I didn't do anything
'cause I didn't believe it.

66
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,550
Now I'm dreaming about that tree,

67
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,460
about our house, and some woman inside
screaming for help. I mean,

68
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,000
that's where it all started, man.
This has to mean something, right?

69
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't know.

70
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,080
What do you mean you don't know, Dean?
This...

71
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,830
This woman might be in danger.

72
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,880
- This might be the thing that killed mom and Jessica.
- All right, just slow down,would you?

73
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,280
I mean, first you're telling me
that you've got this Shining...

74
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,250
...and then you tell me
that I've got to go back home,

75
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,340
especially when...

76
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,320
When what?

77
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,900
When I swore to myself
that I would never go back there.

78
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,770
Dean, we have to check this out.

79
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,220
Just to make sure.

80
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,350
I know we do.

81
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,660
You gonna be all right, man?

82
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,260
Let me get back to you on that.

83
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,510
Yes?

84
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,090
Sorry to bother you, ma'am,

85
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,500
- but we're with the federal...
- I'm Sam Winchester

86
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,430
and this is my brother, Dean.

87
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,740
Um...we used to live here.

88
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,910
You know, we were just driving by, and

89
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,260
we were wondering
if we could come see the old place.

90
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,440
Winchester...

91
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,310
That is so funny.

92
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,710
You know, I,
I think I found some of your photos the other night.

93
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,370
You did?

94
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,570
Okay. Come on in.

95
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,070
Juice, juice, juice!

96
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,950
Juice, juice,  juice!

97
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,710
That's Richie.
He's kind of a juice junkie.

98
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,800
But, hey, at least he won't get scurvy.

99
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,080
Sari,

100
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,500
this is Sam and Dean.

101
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,410
- They used to live here.
- Hi.

102
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,830
Hey, Sari.

103
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,000
So, you just moved in?

104
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,710
Uh, yeah, from Wichita.

105
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,180
You got family here?

106
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,130
No, I just, uh...

107
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,310
um, needed a fresh start.
That's all.

108
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,520
So new town,

109
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,700
new job

110
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,650
I mean, as soon as I find one,

111
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,260
new house.

112
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,930
So, how you liking it so far?

113
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,720
Well, uh, all due respect
to your childhood home,

114
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,140
I mean, I'm sure you have
lots of happy memories here,

115
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,770
but this place has its issues.

116
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,200
What do you mean?

117
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,260
Well, it's just getting old

118
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,700
like, the wiring, you know?
We've got

119
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,860
flickering lights almost hourly.

120
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,170
Oh, that's too bad.

121
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,610
What else?

122
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,100
Um...sink's backed up.
There's rats in the basement.

123
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,520
I'm sorry.

124
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:37,280
- I don't mean to complain.
- No.

125
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,630
Have you seen the rats
or have you just heard scratching?

126
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,620
- Just the scratching, actually.
- Mom?

127
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,770
Ask them if it was here
when they lived here.

128
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,120
What, Sari?

129
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,550
The thing in my closet.

130
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,730
Oh, no, baby, there was
nothing in their closets.

131
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,650
Right?

132
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,620
Right, no.No, of course not.

133
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,370
She had a nightmare the other night.

134
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,940
I wasn't dreaming.

135
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,410
It came into my bedroom,
and it was on fire.

136
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,210
You heard that ?
A figure on fire.

137
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,790
- And that woman Jenny, that was the woman in your dreams?
- Yeah.

138
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,520
And you hear what she was talking about ?
scratching, flickering lights ?

139
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,740
- Both signs of a malevolent spirit.
- Yeah well.

140
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,920
I'm just freaked out your weirdo visions are coming true.

141
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,070
Forget about that for a minute.

142
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,840
- The thing in the house, do you think it's the thing that killed mom and Jessica?
- I don't know!

143
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,010
Has it come back or has it been
there the whole time?

144
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,290
Maybe it's something else entirely.
Sam, we don't know yet.

145
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,010
Those people are in danger, Dean.

146
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,320
- We have to get them out of that house.
- And we will.

147
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,090
- No, I mean now.
- And how you're gonna do that ?

148
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,650
- You got a story she's gonna believe?
- Then what are we supposed to do?!

149
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,840
We just got to chill out, that's all.

150
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,950
If this was any other kind of job,
what would we do?

151
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,690
We'd try to figure out
what we were dealing with.

152
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,680
- We'd dig into the history of the house.
- Exactly.

153
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,190
Except this time we already know what happened.

154
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,700
Yeah, but how much do we know?
How much do you actually remember?

155
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,460
- About that night, you mean?
- Yeah.

156
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,270
Not much.

157
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,000
I remember the fire...

158
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,830
the heat.

159
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,050
Then I carried you out the front door.

160
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,510
You did?

161
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,650
Yeah, well, you never knew that?

162
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,710
No.

163
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,550
And, uh...

164
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,020
well, you know dad's story as well as I do.
Mom was...

165
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,550
was on the ceiling.

166
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,730
Whatever put her there
was long gone by the time dad found her.

167
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,330
And he never had a theory
about what did it?

168
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,330
If he did, he kept it to himself.

169
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,410
God knows we asked him enough times.

170
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,070
Okay.

171
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,380
So, if we're gonna figure out
what's going on now,

172
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,440
we have to figure out
what happened back then,

173
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,210
and see if it's the same thing.

174
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:02,830
Yeah.

175
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,160
Talk to dad's friends, neighbors,
people who were there at the time.

176
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,240
Does this feel like just another job to you?

177
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,430
I'll be right back.
I got to go to the bathroom.

178
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,070
This is John Winchester.

179
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:45,220
If this is an emergency, call my son Dean,
866 907 32 35.

180
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:45,760
Dad...

181
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,240
I know I've left you messages before.

182
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,070
I don't even know if you get 'em.

183
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:57,510
But

184
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,040
I'm with Sam

185
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,530
and we're in Lawrence,

186
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,860
and there's something in our old house.

187
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,800
I don't know if it's the thing
that killed mom or not,

188
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:10,620
but...

189
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,880
I don't know what to do.

190
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,490
So,

191
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,020
whatever you're doing,
if you could get here...

192
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,750
please.

193
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,700
I need your help, dad.

194
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,060
No, sir, nothing weird down there.
I promise.

195
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,390
- Sink just backed upon its own.
- I'll take a look.

196
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,470
Thanks.

197
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,840
Oh, okay, I'll get out of your way.

198
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,260
So you and John Winchester,
you used to own this garage together?

199
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,890
Yeah, we used to. A long time ago.

200
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,840
Matter of fact,

201
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,860
must be 20 years
since John disappeared.

202
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,350
So, why are the cops interested all of a sudden?

203
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,200
Oh, we're reopening some of our unsolved cases,
and the Winchester disappearance is one of them.

204
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,770
Uh-huh. Well, what do you want
to know about John?

205
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,980
Whatever you remember, you know.
Whatever sticks out in your mind.

206
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,860
He was a stubborn bastard.
I remember that.

207
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,920
And, uh...

208
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,720
oh, whatever the game,
he hated to lose, you know?

209
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,400
It was that whole marine thing.

210
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,310
But, uh...

211
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,960
well, he sure loved Mary,

212
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,330
and he doted on those kids.

213
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,180
But that was before the fire.

214
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:05,830
That's right.

215
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,450
He ever talk about that night?

216
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,510
No,

217
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,860
not at first.

218
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,270
- I think he was in shock.
- Right,

219
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,130
but eventually,

220
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,450
what did he say about it?

221
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,790
Oh, he wasn't thinking straight.
He said, uh...

222
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,690
he said something caused that fire
and killed Mary.

223
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,700
He ever say what did it?

224
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,980
Nothing did it.
It was an accident.

225
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,850
An electrical short in the ceiling
or walls or something.

226
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,300
- I begged him to get some help, but...
- But what?

227
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,600
Oh, it just got worse and worse.

228
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,310
How?

229
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,340
Oh, he started reading these strange old books.

230
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,950
He started going to see this palm reader in town.

231
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,120
Palm reader?
You have a name?

232
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,070
No.

233
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,230
All right, so, there are a few psychics
and palm readers in town.

234
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,590
There's someone named El Divino.
There's...

235
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,370
There's the mysterious Mr. Fortinsky.

236
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,980
- Uh, Missouri Moseley, some dude --
- Wait, wait...

237
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,130
Missouri Moseley?

238
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:08,870
What?

239
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,040
That's a psychic?

240
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,180
Uh...yeah.Yeah, I guess so.

241
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,480
In dad's journal...

242
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,900
Look at this.

243
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,720
First page, first sentence.
Read that.

244
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,870
"I went to Missouri...

245
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,570
and I learned the truth."

246
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,060
I always thought he meant the state.

247
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:40,235
All right, then.

248
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,508
Don't you worry about a thing.

249
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:44,972
Your wife is crazy about you.

250
00:18:48,263 --> 00:18:50,806
Whew! Poor bastard.

251
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:53,519
His woman cold-bangin'the gardener.

252
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:56,444
Why didn't you tell him?

253
00:18:56,823 --> 00:18:58,910
People don't come here for the truth.

254
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,704
They come for good news.

255
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:02,926
Well?

256
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:06,224
Sam and Dean, come on already.
I ain't got all day.

257
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:15,661
Well, let me look at you.

258
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,228
Oh, you boys grew up handsome.

259
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:23,582
And you were one goofy-looking kid, too.

260
00:19:25,277 --> 00:19:26,272
Sam.

261
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,510
Oh, honey.

262
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,382
I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

263
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,546
And your father...

264
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:40,645
...he's missing?

265
00:19:43,472 --> 00:19:45,046
How'd you know all that?

266
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,665
Well,

267
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:49,471
you were just thinking it, just now.

268
00:19:49,973 --> 00:19:51,821
Well, where is he?
Is he okay?

269
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:53,786
I don't know.

270
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:55,399
Don't know?

271
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,080
You're supposed to be a psychic, right?

272
00:19:58,722 --> 00:20:02,674
Boy, you see me sawing some bony tramp in half?

273
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,054
You think I'm a magician?

274
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:07,284
I may be able to read thoughts and sense energies in a room,

275
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:09,426
but I can't just pull facts out of thin air.

276
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:09,881
Sit!

277
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:10,731
Please.

278
00:20:20,455 --> 00:20:23,958
Boy, you put your foot on my coffee table,
I'm gonna whack you with a spoon.

279
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:24,862
I didn't do anything.

280
00:20:24,944 --> 00:20:26,383
Well, you were thinking about it.

281
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:34,321
Okay, so...

282
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:36,013
our dad.

283
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:38,249
When did you first meet him?

284
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:40,262
He came for a reading

285
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:43,583
a few days after the fire.

286
00:20:44,438 --> 00:20:47,675
I just told him what was really out there in the dark.

287
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:49,472
I guess you could say

288
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:52,710
I drew back the curtains for him.

289
00:20:52,735 --> 00:20:53,775
What about the fire?

290
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:57,687
Do you know about what killed our mom?

291
00:20:57,915 --> 00:20:58,747
A little.

292
00:20:59,654 --> 00:21:01,721
Your daddy took me to your house.

293
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:03,601
He was hoping I could

294
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:04,763
sense the

295
00:21:05,215 --> 00:21:06,185
echoes,

296
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,165
the fingerprints of this thing.

297
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,423
And could you?

298
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:10,725
I don't...

299
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:13,356
What was it?

300
00:21:14,015 --> 00:21:14,957
I don't know.

301
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:19,482
But it was evil.

302
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:23,921
Look, I feel just awful
about the poor man's hand,

303
00:21:24,877 --> 00:21:27,451
but how can I be held liable?

304
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,289
Yeah, but

305
00:21:30,443 --> 00:21:32,471
I can't afford a lawyer.

306
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:37,444
Okay, listen, y-you just got
to let me call you back.

307
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:41,507
Richie, mommy's gonna be right back,

308
00:21:41,724 --> 00:21:42,439
okay?

309
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:43,344
Okay.

310
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,355
Okay.

311
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,242
So,

312
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:53,335
you think something's back in that house?

313
00:21:54,265 --> 00:21:55,738
Definitely.

314
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,495
I don't understand.

315
00:22:01,047 --> 00:22:02,159
What?

316
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:06,468
I haven't been back inside,

317
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:10,739
but I've been keeping an eye on the place,
and it's been quiet.

318
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:12,996
No sudden deaths, no

319
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:14,806
freak accidents.

320
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,370
Why is it acting up now?

321
00:22:16,842 --> 00:22:17,667
I don't know.

322
00:22:18,377 --> 00:22:21,610
But dad going missing and Jessica dying
and

323
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:23,490
now this house,

324
00:22:23,983 --> 00:22:27,268
all happening at once.
It just feels like something's starting.

325
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,961
That's a comforting thought.

326
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:01,154
Juicy!

327
00:23:15,017 --> 00:23:18,756
Oh, baby, either we have rats
or mommy is going crazy.

328
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:20,168
Richie?

329
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:23,898
Richie?!

330
00:23:33,816 --> 00:23:36,069
Baby, where are you?!

331
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:44,752
Wha...

332
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:54,668
- Mum!
- Oh, my god!

333
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:01,763
Oh, baby!

334
00:24:04,714 --> 00:24:06,387
Sam, Dean,

335
00:24:06,748 --> 00:24:07,879
what are you doing here?

336
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,100
Hey, Jenny.

337
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:11,638
Um, this is our friend Missouri.

338
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:15,646
If it's not too much trouble, we were hoping
to show her the house, you know,

339
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:17,641
for old time's sake.

340
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:19,846
No, you know, this isn't a good time.

341
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:21,770
- I'm kind of busy.
- Listen, Jenny,it's important.

342
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:22,381
Ow!

343
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:25,926
Give the poor girl a break.
Can't you see she's upset?

344
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,338
Forgive this boy. He means well.

345
00:24:27,372 --> 00:24:29,335
He's just not the sharpest tool in the shed.

346
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:30,699
But hear me out.

347
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:32,346
About what?

348
00:24:32,402 --> 00:24:33,622
About this house.

349
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,721
What are you talking about?

350
00:24:36,198 --> 00:24:38,826
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

351
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:43,611
You think there's something in this house,
something that wants to hurt your family.

352
00:24:43,645 --> 00:24:45,046
Am I mistaken?

353
00:24:45,946 --> 00:24:47,620
Who are you?

354
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:50,803
We're people who can help,
who can stop this thing,

355
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:53,200
but you're gonna have to trust us,
just a little.

356
00:24:55,824 --> 00:25:00,838
If there's a dark energy around here,
this room should be the center of it.

357
00:25:02,137 --> 00:25:02,919
Why?

358
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:06,009
This used to be your nursery, Sam.

359
00:25:06,043 --> 00:25:08,237
This is where it all happened.

360
00:25:22,968 --> 00:25:24,585
That an emf?

361
00:25:24,964 --> 00:25:25,529
Yeah.

362
00:25:26,454 --> 00:25:27,270
Amateur.

363
00:25:37,258 --> 00:25:39,993
I don't know if you boys should
be disappointed or relieved,

364
00:25:40,027 --> 00:25:42,128
but this ain't the thing
that took your mom.

365
00:25:43,728 --> 00:25:45,103
Are you sure?

366
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:47,230
How do you know?

367
00:25:47,237 --> 00:25:50,899
It isn't the same energy
I felt the last time I was here.

368
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:52,295
It's something different.

369
00:25:53,244 --> 00:25:54,229
What is it?

370
00:25:55,797 --> 00:25:57,234
Not it...

371
00:25:57,964 --> 00:25:59,453
them.

372
00:26:00,044 --> 00:26:02,999
There's more than one spirit in this place.

373
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:05,668
What are they doing here?

374
00:26:05,701 --> 00:26:08,456
They're here because of
what happened to your family.

375
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:10,860
You see, all those years ago,

376
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:13,397
real evil came to you.

377
00:26:14,727 --> 00:26:19,153
It walked this house.
That kind of evil leaves wounds,

378
00:26:19,188 --> 00:26:21,859
and sometimes wounds get infected.

379
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,832
I don't understand.

380
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:27,022
This place is a magnet for paranormal energy.

381
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:32,056
It's attracted a poltergeist,

382
00:26:32,494 --> 00:26:34,107
a nasty one,

383
00:26:34,846 --> 00:26:38,471
and it won't rest until Jenny
and her babies are dead.

384
00:26:38,504 --> 00:26:40,651
You said there was more than one spirit.

385
00:26:40,737 --> 00:26:42,186
There is.

386
00:26:44,942 --> 00:26:48,118
I just can't quite make out the second one.

387
00:26:52,031 --> 00:26:53,808
Well, one thing's for damn sure,

388
00:26:54,374 --> 00:26:56,144
nobody's dying in this house,

389
00:26:56,178 --> 00:26:57,275
ever again.

390
00:26:57,931 --> 00:27:00,196
So, whatever is here,
how do we stop it?

391
00:27:03,486 --> 00:27:05,530
So, what is all this stuff anyway?

392
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:09,268
Angelica root, van van oil, crossroad dirt,

393
00:27:09,321 --> 00:27:11,188
a few other odds and ends.

394
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:12,405
What are we supposed to do with it?

395
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:15,495
We're gonna put them inside the walls

396
00:27:15,703 --> 00:27:18,818
in the north, south, east, west corners

397
00:27:18,852 --> 00:27:20,713
on each floor of the house.

398
00:27:20,746 --> 00:27:23,742
Punching holes in the drywall.
Jenny's gonna love that.

399
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:26,032
She'll live.

400
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:29,222
And this will destroy the spirits?

401
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:30,487
It should.

402
00:27:31,036 --> 00:27:33,561
It should purify the house completely.

403
00:27:34,663 --> 00:27:36,268
We'll each take a floor,

404
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:38,074
but we work fast.

405
00:27:38,108 --> 00:27:40,864
Once the spirits realize what we're up to,

406
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:42,944
things are gonna get bad.

407
00:27:44,651 --> 00:27:45,472
Okay.

408
00:27:46,753 --> 00:27:48,086
Careful.

409
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:53,206
Look, I -- you know,
I'm not sure I'm comfortable leaving you guys here alone.

410
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,455
Just take your kids to the movie or something,
and

411
00:27:55,491 --> 00:27:57,568
it'll be over by the time you get back.

412
00:27:58,408 --> 00:27:59,074
Okay.

413
00:28:53,695 --> 00:28:55,383
Aah! Uhh!

414
00:29:32,055 --> 00:29:32,802
Sam!

415
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:35,741
Sam!

416
00:29:57,924 --> 00:29:59,073
Come on.

417
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:21,874
Are you sure this is over?

418
00:30:24,927 --> 00:30:26,190
I'm sure.

419
00:30:26,602 --> 00:30:27,189
Why?

420
00:30:28,297 --> 00:30:29,922
Why do you ask?

421
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,278
No, never mind.

422
00:30:33,922 --> 00:30:35,702
It's nothing, I guess.

423
00:30:37,663 --> 00:30:38,938
Hello?

424
00:30:39,495 --> 00:30:40,920
We're home.

425
00:30:43,846 --> 00:30:45,395
What happened?

426
00:30:45,495 --> 00:30:48,070
Hi. Sorry.
Um, we'll...

427
00:30:48,103 --> 00:30:50,059
we'll pay for all of this.

428
00:30:50,794 --> 00:30:52,174
Don't you worry.

429
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,220
Dean's gonna clean up this mess.

430
00:30:57,135 --> 00:30:59,047
Well, what are you waiting for, boy?

431
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,820
Get the mop.

432
00:31:00,691 --> 00:31:02,194
And don't cuss at me.

433
00:31:22,941 --> 00:31:23,676
Okay.

434
00:32:15,671 --> 00:32:17,699
So, tell me again.
What are we still doing here?

435
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:19,141
I don't know, I-I just...

436
00:32:19,763 --> 00:32:21,289
I still have a bad feeling.

437
00:32:21,853 --> 00:32:22,825
Why?

438
00:32:23,322 --> 00:32:26,835
Missouri did her whole zelda rubenstein thing.
The house should be clean. This should be over.

439
00:32:27,052 --> 00:32:29,854
Yeah, probably, but I just want to make sure.
That's all.

440
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:34,210
The problem is I could be sleeping in a bed right now.

441
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:39,326
Dean!

442
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,464
Dean!

443
00:32:42,352 --> 00:32:44,129
You grab the kids,
I'll get Jenny.

444
00:33:02,108 --> 00:33:03,748
- Come on!
- Jenny!

445
00:33:03,785 --> 00:33:06,307
- I can't open the door!
- Stand back!

446
00:33:09,262 --> 00:33:10,708
- Come on!
- No, my kids!

447
00:33:10,715 --> 00:33:11,794
Sam's got your kids. Come on.

448
00:33:14,445 --> 00:33:15,499
Help!

449
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:17,207
Please!

450
00:33:20,688 --> 00:33:21,760
Come here.

451
00:33:22,437 --> 00:33:23,971
Don't look, don't look.

452
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:40,001
Sari, take your brother outside
as fast as you can and don't look back.

453
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:49,517
Are you okay, baby?

454
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,295
- Sari, where's Sam?
- He's inside. Something's got him.

455
00:34:13,756 --> 00:34:15,609
Ugh! Aah!

456
00:34:37,817 --> 00:34:38,374
Sam!

457
00:34:58,349 --> 00:34:59,150
Sam?!

458
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:00,525
Sam!

459
00:35:05,106 --> 00:35:07,167
- No, don't! Don't!
- What? Why?

460
00:35:08,432 --> 00:35:09,858
Because I know who it is.

461
00:35:10,606 --> 00:35:12,261
I can see her now.

462
00:35:28,764 --> 00:35:30,051
Mom.

463
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:41,248
Dean.

464
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:57,434
Sam.

465
00:36:03,676 --> 00:36:05,273
I'm sorry.

466
00:36:09,821 --> 00:36:11,422
F-for what?

467
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,042
You, get out of my house.

468
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,064
And let go of my son.

469
00:36:58,172 --> 00:36:59,687
Now it's over.

470
00:37:12,906 --> 00:37:14,114
Thanks for these.

471
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:16,634
Don't thank me. They're yours.

472
00:37:21,173 --> 00:37:22,016
Well,

473
00:37:22,477 --> 00:37:25,942
there are no spirits in there anymore,
this time for sure.

474
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:28,696
Not even my mom?

475
00:37:29,336 --> 00:37:30,623
No.

476
00:37:34,821 --> 00:37:36,256
What happened?

477
00:37:37,265 --> 00:37:41,753
Your mom's spirit and the poltergeists' energy,
they canceled each other out.

478
00:37:42,224 --> 00:37:45,683
Your mom destroyed herself going after the thing.

479
00:37:46,894 --> 00:37:49,073
Why would she do something like that?

480
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:53,050
Well, to protect her boys, of course.

481
00:38:00,638 --> 00:38:02,562
Sam, I'm sorry.

482
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:06,168
For what?

483
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:09,437
You sensed it was here,
didn't you?

484
00:38:09,471 --> 00:38:11,133
Even when I couldn't.

485
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:17,646
What's happening to me?

486
00:38:18,574 --> 00:38:21,466
I know I should have all the answers, but...

487
00:38:23,106 --> 00:38:24,481
I don't know.

488
00:38:25,034 --> 00:38:26,424
Sam, you ready ?

489
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,389
Bye.

490
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:36,598
Bye Sam.

491
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:40,135
Ah.

492
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:43,048
Don't you boys be strangers.

493
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:44,643
We won't.

494
00:38:46,134 --> 00:38:47,341
See you around.

495
00:39:17,509 --> 00:39:19,048
That boy...

496
00:39:20,622 --> 00:39:22,433
he has such

497
00:39:22,522 --> 00:39:24,443
powerful abilities.

498
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:30,719
Why he couldn't sense his own father,

499
00:39:30,923 --> 00:39:32,482
I have no idea.

500
00:39:38,024 --> 00:39:39,120
Mary's spirit...

501
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:43,067
do you really think she saved the boys?

502
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,234
I do.

503
00:39:57,782 --> 00:40:00,405
John Winchester, I could just slap you.

504
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:02,833
Why don't you go talk to your children?

505
00:40:04,406 --> 00:40:05,863
God, I want to.

506
00:40:07,776 --> 00:40:10,182
You have no idea how much I want to see them.

507
00:40:13,016 --> 00:40:13,936
But I can't.

508
00:40:15,536 --> 00:40:16,216
Not yet.

509
00:40:22,518 --> 00:40:24,228
Not until I know the truth.
