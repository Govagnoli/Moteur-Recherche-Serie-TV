Previously on Supernatural.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,950
Take your brother outside as  fast
as you can ! Now Dean ! Go !

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,760
Mary ! No !

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,550
Dad's on a hunting trip.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,130
And he hasn't been
home in a few days.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,360
I swore I was done hunting,

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,460
I can't do this alone.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,140
We got work to do.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,710
This is dad's single

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,980
most valuable possession.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,220
Everything he knows about
every evil thing is in here.

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,150
I think he wants us to
pick up where he left off.

13
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,450
You know, saving people,

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,520
hunting things...

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,400
Family business.

16
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:39,910
No.

17
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,270
I gotta find Jessica's killer.

18
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,720
It's the only thing
I can think about.

19
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,550
Sam, you know we're
gonna find dad, right ?

20
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,630
Yeah, I know.

22
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,430
Morning, daddy.

23
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,820
Morning, sweetheart.

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,140
All these workouts,
Soph, I don't know.

25
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,990
Guys don't like buff girls.

26
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,840
Yeah, well, girls don't like
guys who still live at home.

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,840
Be careful.

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,950
I will.

29
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,700
Can I get you anything else ?

30
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,280
Just the check, please.

31
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,250
Okay.

32
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,970
You know, Sam, we are allowed
to have fun once in a while.

33
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,750
That's fun.

34
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,860
Here, take a look at this.
I think I got one.

35
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,730
Lake Manitoc, Wisconsin.

36
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,460
Last week, Sophie Carlton,

37
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,690
18, walks into the lake,

38
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,910
doesn't walk out.

39
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,560
Authorities dragged the water.

40
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,500
Nothing.

41
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,420
Sophie Carlton is the third
Lake Manitoc drowning this year.

42
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,240
None of the other bodies
were found, either

43
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,480
They had a funeral
two days ago.

44
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,120
A funeral ?

45
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,120
Yes, they buried an empty coffin.

46
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,140
for closure or whatever.

47
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,410
Closure ?

48
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,410
What closure ?

49
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,300
People don't just
disappear, Dean.

50
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,420
Other people just stop
looking for them.

51
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,190
Something you want
to say to me ?

52
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,860
The trail for dad.
It's getting colder.

53
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,540
every day.

54
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,500
- What are we supposed to do ?
- I don't know.

55
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,510
Something.

56
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,740
- Anything.
- No one.

57
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,120
I'm sick of this attitude.

58
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,950
You don't think I want to find
dad as much as you do ?

59
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,730
Yeah, I know you do it.

60
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,340
I'm the one that's been with him
every single day for the past two years.

61
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,550
While you've been off to
college going to pep rallies.

62
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,830
We will find dad,

63
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,010
but until then, we're
gonna kill everything bad,

64
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,620
between here and there.

65
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,410
Okay ?

66
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,710
All right, Lake Manitoc.

67
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:23,750
Hey.

68
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,280
Huh ?

69
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,090
How far ?

70
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,400
Will Carlton ?

71
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,430
Yeah, that's right.

72
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,610
I'm agent Ford.

73
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,080
This is agent Hamill.

74
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,260
We're with the U.S.
Wildlife service.

75
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,080
She was about 100 yards out.

76
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,700
That's where she
got dragged down.

77
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,050
And you're sure she
didn't just drown ?

78
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,510
Yeah.

79
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,190
She was a varsity swimmer.

80
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,000
She practically
grew up in that lake.

81
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,170
She's as safe out there
as in her own bathtub.

82
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,950
So no splashing,

83
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,110
no signs of distress ?

84
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,260
No, that's what
I'm telling you.

85
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,500
Did you see any
shadows in the water,

86
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,120
maybe,

87
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,660
some dark shape
breach the surface ?

88
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,650
No, again, she was
really far out there.

89
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,430
You ever see any strange
tracks by the shoreline ?

90
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,330
No, never.

91
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,220
Why ?

92
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,630
What do you think's out there ?

93
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,270
We'll let you know
as soon as we do.

94
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,860
What about your father ?

95
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,490
Can we talk to him ?

96
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,100
Look.

97
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,630
If you don't mind,
I mean,

98
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,250
he didn't see anything, and
he's kind of been through a lot.

99
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,310
We understand.

100
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,330
Now, I'm sorry, but,

101
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,400
why does the wildlife service
care about an accidental drowning ?

102
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,820
You sure it's accidental ?

103
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,980
Will Carlton saw
something grab his sister.

104
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,620
Like what ?

105
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,030
Here, sit, please.

106
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,000
There are no indigenous
carnivores in that lake.

107
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,780
There's nothing even big
enough to pull down a person,

108
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,640
unless it was the Loch Ness monster.

109
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,860
Yeah, right.

110
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,890
Will Carlton was traumatized, and
sometimes the mind plays tricks.

111
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,130
Still,

112
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,070
we dragged that entire lake.
We even ran a sonar sweep,

113
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,790
just to be sure, and there
was nothing down there.

114
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,830
That's weird, though.

115
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,790
That's the third
missing body this year.

116
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,920
I know.

117
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,270
These are people from my town.

118
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,860
These are people I care about.

119
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,750
I know.

120
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,090
Anyway . . .

121
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,930
All this.

122
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,020
It won't be a problem
much longer.

123
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,590
What do you mean ?

124
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,820
Well, the dam,
of course.

125
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,230
Of course.

126
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,350
The dam.

127
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,650
It's, uh...

128
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:54,850
It sprung a leak.

129
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,000
It's falling apart,

130
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,240
and the feds won't give
us the grant to repair it,

131
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,930
so they've opened
the spillway.

132
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,250
In another six months,

133
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,200
there won't be
much of a lake.

134
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,950
There won't be much
of a town, either,

135
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,110
but as federal wildlife,

136
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,570
you already knew that.

137
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,050
Exactly.

138
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,550
Sorry, am I interrupting ?

139
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,240
I think come back later.

140
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,300
Gentlemen, this is my daughter.

141
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,850
It's a pleasure to meet you.

142
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,070
I'm Dean.

143
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,770
Andrea Bar. Hi.

144
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,370
Hi.

145
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,040
They're from the
wildlife service,

146
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,830
about the lake.

147
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,120
Oh, hey, there.

148
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,320
What's your name ?

149
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,670
His name is Lucas.

150
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,290
Is he okay ?

151
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,920
My grandson's been through a lot.

152
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,080
We all have.

153
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,700
Well,

154
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,950
if there's anything else
I can do for you,

155
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,990
please, let me know.

156
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:52,830
Thanks.

157
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,320
You know, now that
you mentioned it,

158
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,520
could you point us in the direction
of a reasonably priced motel ?

159
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,310
Lakefront motel, go around
the corner, it's two blocks up.

160
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,060
Two.

161
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,630
Would you mind showing us ?

162
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,580
You want me to
walk you two blocks ?

163
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,890
Not if it's any trouble.

164
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,260
I'm headed that way anyway.

165
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,330
I'll be back to pick up lucas at 3:00.

166
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,090
We'll go to the park,
okay, sweetie ?

167
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:19,960
Thanks again.

168
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,160
So, cute kid.

169
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,060
Thanks.

170
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,540
Kids are the best, huh ?

171
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,480
There it is.

172
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,510
Like I said, two blocks.

173
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,330
Thanks.

174
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,470
Must be hard with
your sense of direction,

175
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,610
never being able to find your
way to a decent pickup line.

176
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,270
Enjoy your stay.

177
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,150
"Kids are the best" ?

178
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,500
- You don't even like kids.
- I love kids.

179
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,710
Name three children
that you even know.

180
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,200
I'm thinking.

181
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,000
So there's the three
drowning victims this year.

182
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,940
And before that ?

183
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,740
Yeah, six more,

184
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,280
spread outover the past 35 years.

185
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,150
Those bodies were
never recovered, either.

186
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,170
If there is something out there,

187
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,230
it's picking up its pace.

188
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,750
So we got a lake monster on a binge ?

189
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,380
This whole lake monster
theory, it just bugs me.

190
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,450
Why ?

191
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,650
Loch Ness, lake Champlain

192
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,150
there are literally hundreds
of eyewitness accounts,

193
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,990
but here, almost nothing.

194
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,540
Whatever it is out there,

195
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,130
Noone's living to talk about it.

196
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,590
Wait, Bar,

197
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,650
Christopher Bar, where have
I heard that name before ?

198
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,190
Christopher Bar,
the victim in may.

199
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,630
Christopher Bar was
Andrea's husband,

200
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,300
Lucas' father.

201
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,570
Apparently,

202
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,560
he took Lucas out swimming.

203
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,900
Lucas was on a floating wooden
platform when Chris drowned,

204
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,280
two hours,

205
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,480
before the kid got rescued.

206
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,000
Maybe we have an
eyewitness after all.

207
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,220
No wonder that kid
was so freaked out.

208
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,010
Watching one of your parents die
isn't something you just get over.

209
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,310
Can we join you ?

210
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,520
I'm here with my son.

211
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,970
Mind if I say hi ?

212
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,530
Tell your friend this whole "jerry maguire"
thing's not gonna work on me.

213
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,930
I don't think that's
what this is about.

214
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,190
How's it going ?

215
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,520
Oh, I used to
love these things.

216
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,810
So crayons is
more your thing ?

217
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,230
That's cool.
Chicks dig artists.

218
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,900
Hey, these are pretty good.

219
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,410
You mind if I sit and
draw with you for a while ?

220
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,360
I'm not so bad myself.

221
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,290
You know, I'm thinking
you can hear me.

222
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,190
You just don't want to talk.

223
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,820
I don't know exactly
what happened to your dad,

224
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,680
but I know it was
something real bad.

225
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,570
I think I know how you feel.

226
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,130
When I was your age,
I saw something.

227
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,890
Anyway . . .

228
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,530
Maybe you don't think
anyone will listen to you.

229
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,190
Or, uh...

230
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,090
Or believe you.

231
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,380
I want you to know that I will.

232
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,190
You don't even have to

233
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,180
say anything.
You could draw me a picture,

234
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,530
about what you saw that day,

235
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,010
with your dad,

236
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,090
on the lake.

237
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,890
Okay,

238
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:55,960
no problem.

239
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,390
This is for you.

240
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,730
This is my family.

241
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,170
That's my dad.

242
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,330
That's...

243
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,970
That's my mom.

244
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,240
That's my geek brother,

245
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,250
and that's me.

246
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,620
All right, so I'm
a sucky artist.

247
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,340
I'll see you around, Lucas.

248
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,870
Lucas hasn't said a word,
not even to me,

249
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,520
not since

250
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,950
his dad's accident.

251
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,700
Yeah, we heard.

252
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:39,860
Sorry.

253
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,670
What are the doctors saying ?

254
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,340
That it's a kind of
post-traumatic stress.

255
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,610
That can't be easy

256
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,430
for either of you.

257
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,940
We moved in with my dad.

258
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,470
He helps out a lot.

259
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,490
It's just...

260
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,230
when I think about what Lucas
went through, what he saw...

261
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,700
Kids are strong.

262
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,180
You'd be surprised
what they can deal with.

263
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,970
You know,

264
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,020
he used to have such life.

265
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,590
He was hard to keep up with,
to tell you the truth.

266
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,090
Now he just sits there,

267
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,700
drawing those pictures,
playing with those army men.

268
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,180
I just wish.

269
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,900
Hey, sweetie.

270
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,950
Thanks.

271
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,030
Thanks, Lucas.

272
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,660
Hey, dad.

273
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,750
You should probably
eat something.

274
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,320
I'm gonna make
some dinner, okay ?

275
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,550
So,

276
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,600
I think it's safe to say
we can rule out Nessie.

277
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,400
What do you mean ?

278
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,490
I just drove past the Carlton house.
There was an ambulance there.

279
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,980
Will Carlton is dead.

280
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,760
He drowned ?

281
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,350
Yep, in the sink.

282
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,140
What the hell ?

283
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,660
So this isn't a creature. We're
dealing with something else.

284
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,460
Yeah, but what ?

285
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,090
I don't know.

286
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,310
A water wraith maybe ?

287
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,570
Some kind of demon ?

288
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,390
I mean, something
that controls water...

289
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,220
...water that comes
from the Same source.

290
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,060
- The lake
- Yeah

291
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,920
which would explain why
it's upping the body count.

292
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,070
The lake is draining. It'll be dry in
a few months. Whatever this thing is,

293
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,520
whatever it wants,

294
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,670
it's running out of time.

295
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,190
And if it can get
through the pipes,

296
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,580
it can get to anyone,

297
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,540
almost anywhere.

298
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,560
This is gonna happen again soon.

299
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,270
And we do know one other thing for sure.

300
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,510
We know this has got
something to do with Bill Carlton.

301
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,560
It took both his kids.

302
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,810
And I've been asking around.

303
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,120
Lucas' dad, Chris

304
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,820
Bill Carlton's godson.

305
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,150
Let's go pay
Mr. Carlton a visit.

306
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,790
Mr. Carlton ?

307
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,340
We'd like to ask you
a few questions,

308
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,080
if you don't mind.

309
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,440
- We're from the department
- I don't care who you're with.

310
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,440
I've answered
enough questions today.

311
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,080
Your son said he saw
something in that lake.

312
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,130
What about you ?

313
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,150
You ever see anything out there ?

314
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,510
Mr. Carlton,

315
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,420
Sophie's drowning
and Will's death.

316
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,120
We think there might
be a connection,

317
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,000
- to you or your family.
- My children are gone.

318
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,180
It's...

319
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,820
It's worse than dying.

320
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,790
Go away...

321
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,230
Please.

322
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,290
What do you think ?

323
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,150
I think the poor guy's
been through hell.

324
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,650
I also think he's not
telling us something.

325
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,660
So now what ?

326
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,220
What is it ?

327
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,300
Maybe Bill's not the only
one who knows something.

328
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,340
I'm sorry, but I don't
think it's a good idea.

329
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,490
I just need to talk to him,

330
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,570
just for a few minutes.

331
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,290
He won't say anything.

332
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,320
- What good's it gonna do?
- Andrea,

333
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,060
we think more people
might get hurt.

334
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,900
We think something's
happening out there.

335
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,530
My husband, the others,
they just drowned.

336
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,630
That's all.

337
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,780
If that's what
you really believe,

338
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,580
then we'll go,

339
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,750
but if you think
there's even a possibility

340
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,770
that something else
could be going on here,

341
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,720
please let me talk to your son.

342
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,790
Hey, Lucas.

343
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,340
You remember me ?

344
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,730
You know, I, uh...

345
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,640
I wanted to thank you
for that last drawing...

346
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,270
...but the thing is

347
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,060
I need your help again.

348
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,110
How did you know
to draw this ?

349
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,010
Did you know something
bad was gonna happen ?

350
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,040
Maybe you could

351
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,920
nod yes or no

352
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:24,810
for me.

353
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,190
You're scared.

354
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,000
It's okay.

355
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,930
I understand.

356
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,730
See, when I was your age,

357
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,200
I saw something real
bad happen to my mom,

358
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,190
and I was scared, too.

359
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,230
I didn't feel like talking,

360
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,710
just like you,

361
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,340
but, see, my mom,

362
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,640
I know she wanted
me to be brave.

363
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,430
I think about
that every day.

364
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,320
And I do my best
to be brave.

365
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,700
And maybe your dad

366
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,260
wants you to be brave, too.

367
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,500
Thanks, Lucas.

368
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,530
Andrea said the kid never drew
like that till his dad died.

369
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,810
There are cases going
through a traumatic experience

370
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,470
could make certain people more sensitive
to premonitions, psychic tendencies.

371
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,760
What if Lucas is
tapping into it somehow ?

372
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,940
It's only a matter of time
before somebody else drowns,

373
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,540
so if you got
a better lead, please.

374
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,230
All right.

375
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,380
We got another house to find.

376
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,680
There's about a thousand yellow
two-stories in this county alone.

377
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,450
See this church ?

378
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,850
I bet there's less than
a thousand of those around here.

379
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,300
Oh, college boy
thinks he's so smart.

380
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,670
You know, um...

381
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,790
What you said about mom.

382
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,360
You never told me that before.

383
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,090
It's no big deal.

384
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,550
Oh, god, we're not gonna have
to hug or anything, are we ?

385
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,530
We're sorry to bother you, ma'am,

386
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,910
but does a little boy
live here by chance ?

387
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,010
He might wear

388
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,160
a blue ball cap,

389
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,730
has a red bicycle.

390
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,570
No, sir.

391
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,150
Not for a very long time.

392
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,290
Peter's been gone 35 years now.

393
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,760
The police never

394
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,570
I never had any idea
what happened.

395
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,600
He just disappeared.

396
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,560
Losing him,

397
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,550
you know,

398
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:41,550
it's...

399
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,390
It's worse than dying.

400
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,910
Did he disappear from here,

401
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:52,920
I mean, from this house ?

402
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,150
He was supposed to

403
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,050
ride his bike

404
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,420
straight home

405
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,570
after school,

406
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,430
and he never showed up.

407
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,620
"Peter Sweeney and Billy Carlton,

408
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,280
1970."

409
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,090
You've taken everything,

410
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,710
everyone.

411
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,810
I've got nothing left.

412
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,550
I didn't understand.

413
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,900
I didn't believe.

414
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,950
Now I think I do.

415
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,230
I think I finally
know what you want.

416
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,220
Okay, this little boy,
Peter Sweeney, vanishes,

417
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,520
and this is all connected
to Bill Carlton somehow.

418
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,410
Bill sure as hell seems
to be hiding something.

419
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,840
And Bill, the people he loves

420
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,790
they're all getting punished.

421
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,340
So that Bill did
something to Peter.

422
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,640
What if Bill killed him ?

423
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,410
Peter's spirit
would be furious.

424
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,870
It'd want revenge.
It's possible.

425
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,570
Mr. Carlton !

426
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,950
Hey. Check it out.

427
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,630
Mr. Carlton !
You need to come back !

428
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,910
Come out of the water !
Turn the boat around !

429
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,640
Baby, what's wrong ?

430
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,150
Sam, Dean.

431
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,760
I didn't expect
to see you here.

432
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,540
So now you're on
a first-name basis.

433
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,730
What are you doing here ?

434
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,940
I brought you dinner.

435
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,070
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I don't really have the time.

436
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,680
I heard about Bill Carlton.

437
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,230
Is it true? Is something
going on with the lake ?

438
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,830
Right now, we don't
know what the truth is,

439
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,480
but I think it might be better
if you and lucas went on home.

440
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,960
Lucas, hey, what is it ?

441
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,540
- Lucas.
- Lucas.

442
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,080
Lucas, it's okay.
It's okay. Hey,

443
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,510
Lucas, it's okay.
It's okay.

444
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,100
Okay, just so I'm clear,
you see . . .

445
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,230
something

446
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,170
attack Bill's boat,

447
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,780
sending Bill,

448
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,450
who is a very good
swimmer, by the way,

449
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,940
into the drink,

450
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,390
and you never
see him again ?

451
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,130
Yeah, that about sums it up.

452
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,620
And I'm supposed
to believe this,

453
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,290
even though I've already
sonar-swept that entire lake

454
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,890
and what you're
describing is impossible

455
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,770
and you're not really
wildlife service ?

456
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,800
That's right,

457
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,720
I checked.

458
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,550
The department's
never heard of you two.

459
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,720
See ?

460
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,640
- Now, we can explain that.
- Enough,

461
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,410
please.

462
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,790
The only reason
you're breathing free air

463
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,740
is one of Bill's neighbors saw him
steering out that boat just before you did.

464
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,080
So

465
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,820
we have a couple
of options here.

466
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,210
I can arrest you for
impersonating government officials

467
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,680
and hold you as material witnesses
to Bill Carlton's disappearance,

468
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,710
or

469
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,710
we can chalk this
all up to a bad day,

470
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,380
you get into your car,

471
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,290
you put this town
in your rearview mirror,

472
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:59,330
and you don't ever
darken my doorstep

473
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,070
again !

474
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,180
Door number two sounds good.

475
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,860
That's the one I'd pick.

476
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,190
Baby...

477
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,430
What are you doing up ?

478
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,810
Come on, let's go to bed.

479
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,270
Green.

480
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,070
What ?

481
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,530
Light's green.

482
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,300
Ah, the interstate's
the other way.

483
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:01,910
I know.

484
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,610
But, Dean, this job,
I think it's over.

485
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,460
I'm not so sure.

486
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,410
If bill murdered Peter Sweeney
and Peter's spirit got its revenge,

487
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,580
case closed.
The spirit should be at rest.

488
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,850
All right, so what if we take off
and this thing isn't done ?

489
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,090
What if we missed something ?
What if more people get hurt ?

490
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,680
But why would you think that ?

491
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,030
Because Lucas
was really scared.

492
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,710
That's what this is about ?

493
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,900
I just don't want to leave town
till I know the kid's okay.

494
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,300
Who are you,

495
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,160
and what have you
done with my brother ?

496
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,610
Shut up.

497
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,900
Are you sure about this ?

498
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,470
It's pretty late, man.

499
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,080
Lucas ? Lucas !

500
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,790
Lucas !

501
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,700
Can you tell me ?

502
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,580
No

503
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,950
It doesn't make any sense.

504
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,370
I'm going crazy.

505
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,810
No, you're not.

506
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,310
Tell me what happened.

507
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,800
Everything.

508
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,910
I heard...

509
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,450
I thought I heard...

510
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,420
there was this voice.

511
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,850
What did it say ?

512
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:51,710
It said

513
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,800
it said, "come play with me."

514
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,930
What's happening ?

515
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,230
Do you recognize the
kids in these pictures ?

516
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,070
What ?

517
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,770
No, I huh...

518
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,840
I mean, except that's
my dad right there.

519
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,350
He must have been about

520
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,500
12 in these pictures.

521
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,370
Chris Bar's drowning

522
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,920
the connection wasn't to Bill Carlton.
It must have been to sheriff.

523
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,390
Bill and the sheriff,

524
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,280
they were both
involved with Peter.

525
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,530
What about Chris ?

526
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,200
My dad, what are
you talking about ?

527
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,280
Lucas ?

528
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,250
Lucas, what is it ?

529
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,410
Lucas, honey ?

530
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,070
You and Lucas get back to
the house and stay there, okay ?

531
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,660
Peter's bike.

532
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,430
Who are you?

533
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,130
Put the gun down, Jake.

534
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,230
How did you know
that was there ?

535
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,080
What happened ?

536
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,770
You and Bill killed Peter,

537
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,880
drowned him in the lake,
and then buried the bike ?

538
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,450
You can't bury
the truth, Jake.

539
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,150
Nothing stays buried.

540
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,020
Go to your room, sweetie.

541
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,070
Now.

542
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,300
Lock the door and wait
for me. Don't come out.

543
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,970
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

544
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,320
You and Bill killed
Peter Sweeney 35 years ago.

545
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:09,290
that's what the hell
I'm talking about.

546
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:09,880
Dad

547
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,150
And now you got one
seriously pissed-off spirit.

548
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,400
It's gonna take Andrea,

549
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,260
Lucas,

550
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,500
everyone you love.

551
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,020
It's gonna drown them,

552
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,200
and it's gonna drag their
bodies god knows where.

553
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,670
So you can feel the Same
pain Peter's mom felt.

554
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,740
And then after that,

555
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,610
it's gonna take you,

556
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:27,570
and it's not gonna
stop until it does.

557
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,450
How do you know that ?

558
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,910
Because that's exactly
what it did to Bill Carlton.

559
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,070
Listen to yourselves,

560
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:33,900
both of you.

561
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,040
You're insane.

562
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,190
I don't really give a rat's ass
what you think of us,

563
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,740
but if we're gonna
bring down this spirit,

564
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,440
we need to find the remains,

565
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,480
salt them,

566
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,700
and burn them into dust.

567
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,350
Tell me you buried
Peter somewhere.

568
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,040
Tell me you didn't just
let him go in the lake.

569
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,790
Come play with me.

570
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,050
Dad,

571
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,110
is any of this true ?

572
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,340
No. Don't listen to them.

573
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,620
They're liars,
and they're dangerous.

574
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,330
Something tried
to drown me.

575
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,100
Chris died on that lake.

576
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,220
Dad, look at me.

577
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,060
Tell me you

578
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,590
you didn't kill anyone.

579
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,170
Oh, my god.

580
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,510
Billy and I were at the lake.

581
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,010
Peter was the smallest one.
We always bullied him,

582
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,590
but this time...

583
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,860
It got rough.

584
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,180
We were holding his
head under the water.

585
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,240
We didn't mean to,

586
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,670
but we held him
under too long,

587
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:49,950
and he drowned.

588
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,940
We let the body go,

589
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,650
and it sank.

590
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,640
Oh, Andrea.

591
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,760
We were kids.

592
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,100
We were so scared.

593
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,100
It was a mistake,

594
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,940
but, Andrea,

595
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,540
to say that I have anything
to do with these drownings,

596
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,650
with Chris,

597
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,640
because of some ghost

598
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,400
it's not rational.

599
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,600
All right, listen to me,

600
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,000
all of you.

601
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,090
We need to get you
away from this lake

602
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,760
as far as we can right now.

603
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,110
Lucas !

604
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,750
Come play with me.

605
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,380
Lucas !

606
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,150
Lucas !
Stay where you are !

607
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,470
Oh, my god !

608
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,950
Andrea, stay there.

609
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,130
No, Lucas !

610
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,430
We'll get him.
Stay on the dock.

611
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,410
Lucas ?

612
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,790
Sam ?

613
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,100
Lucas, where are you ?

614
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:28,820
Peter,

615
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:29,920
if you can hear me,

616
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:31,950
please, Peter,

617
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,700
I'm sorry.

618
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:34,930
- I'm so...
- Dad, no !

619
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm so sorry.

620
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,020
Peter.

621
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:37,910
Lucas

622
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,270
he's j... he's
just a little boy.

623
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,950
Please, it's not
his fault. It's mine.

624
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,220
Please take me !

625
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:45,710
Jake,

626
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:46,110
no !

627
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,760
Listen, let it be over!

628
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,600
Dad

629
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,200
Daddy !

630
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,460
No

631
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,900
No...

632
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,470
Look,

633
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,590
we're not gonna
save everybody.

634
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:51,760
I know.

635
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,230
Sam,

636
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,260
Dean.

637
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,130
Hey.

638
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,900
We're glad
we caught you.

639
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,180
We just, um,

640
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,770
we made you
lunch for the road.

641
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,160
Lucas insisted on making
the sandwiches himself.

642
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:07,580
Can I give it
to them now ?

643
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,020
Of course.

644
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,940
Come on, Lucas,
let's load this in the car.

645
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,210
How you holding up?

646
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,380
It's just gonna take a long time
to sort through everything, you know ?

647
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,720
Andrea, I'm sorry.

648
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,410
You saved my son.

649
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,790
I can't ask
for more than that.

650
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,160
Dad loved me.

651
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,450
He loved Lucas.

652
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,360
No matter what he did,

653
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,460
I just have to...

654
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,150
hold on to that.

655
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:55,900
All right,

656
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,470
if you're gonna
be talking now,

657
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,650
this is a very important phrase, so
I want you to repeat it one more time.

658
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,760
Zeppelin rules !

659
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,110
That's right.
Up high.

660
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,540
Take care of
your mom, okay ?

661
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,660
Thank you.

662
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,880
Sam, move your ass.

663
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,240
We're gonna run out of daylight
before we hit the road.
