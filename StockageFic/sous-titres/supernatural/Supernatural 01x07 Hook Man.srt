1
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,170
Okay, what do you think?

2
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,220
Um...

3
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,400
Oh, god. Too Martha Stewart?

4
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,180
Here, wear this.

5
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,920
Um...

6
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,940
I don't know if this is really me.

7
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,620
Lori, there's a hot chick buried somewhere in there.

8
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,590
Okay, okay.

9
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,290
so?

10
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,250
Damn, girl!

11
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,440
He's not gonna know what hit him.

12
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,710
okay, I think he's probably downstairs.

13
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,060
I'll see you later.

14
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,100
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

15
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,910
There's nothing you wouldn't do.

16
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,500
It's true.

17
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,780
I thought we were going to the party.

18
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,500
Well, we can't arrive on time.

19
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,350
You know, if I didn't know any better,

20
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,350
I'd think you brought me here on purpose.

21
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,630
What? I'm offended.

22
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,220
Yeah, I'm sure.

23
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,620
Do you want to get that?

24
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,410
Definitely not.

25
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,530
No.

26
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,250
It's okay.

27
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,510
Hey, I mean it.

28
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,550
What was that?

29
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,960
I don't know.

30
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,130
What is that?

31
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,900
Rich, no!

32
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,950
Just wait here.

33
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,250
What the hell?

34
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,630
Rich, let's go.

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,610
Aah!

36
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,140
Aah!

37
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,040
Rich?

38
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,490
Rich?

39
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,460
Rich, where are you?

40
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,480
Okay.

41
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,570
Okay.

42
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,180
All right.

43
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,050
Thank you for your time.

44
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,880
Your half-caff

45
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,130
double venti vanilla latte

46
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,130
is getting cold over here,

47
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:15,820
Francis.

48
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,690
Byte me.

49
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,860
So, anything?

50
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,300
I had them check the FBI's

51
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,810
missing-persons databank.

52
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,660
No "John Does"

53
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,850
fitting that description.

54
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,000
I even ran his plates

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,220
for traffic violations.

56
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,440
I'm telling you, I don't think

57
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,600
dad wants to be found.

58
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,080
Check this out.

59
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,900

out of plains courier,

00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,870
Ankeny, Iowa.

62
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:36,830
It's about 100 miles

63
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,450
from here.

64
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,710
"Mutilated body was found

67
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,000
Keep reading.

68
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,950
"Authorities are unable

Could be something

77
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,060
interesting.

78
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,900
It could be nothing.

79
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,090
One witness

80
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,940
who didn't see anything

81
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,540
doesn't mean

82
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,430
it's the invisible man.

83
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,630
But what if it is?

84
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,830
Dad would check it out.

85
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,490
Why are we here?

86
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,190
Victim lived here.

87
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,010
Nice wheels.

88
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,580
We're your fraternity brothersfrom ohio.

89
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,090
We're new in town, transfers.

90
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,570
Looking for a place to stay.

91
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,010
Who are you?

92
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,110
We're your new roommates.

93
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,390
Do me a favor?Get my back.

94
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,880
Big game today.

95
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,270
He's the artist.

96
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,050
Things he can dowith a brush...

97
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,490
so...

98
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,300
murph, is it true?

99
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,790
What?

100
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,090
We heard one of the guys heregot killed last week.

101
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,390
Yeah.

102
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,780
What happened?

103
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,590
They're saying some psychowith a knife,

104
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,310
maybe a drifterpassing through.

105
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,160
Rich was a good guy.

106
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,700
Rich was with somebody?

107
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,140
Not just somebody

108
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:41,960
Lori Sorenson.

109
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,580
Who's lori sorenson?

110
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,800
You missed a spotdown on the back.

111
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,480
Lori's a freshman.She's a local.

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,300
Super hot.

113
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,780
And get this

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,530
she's a reverend's daughter.

115
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,270
You wouldn't happen to know which church, would you?

116
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,890
Our hearts go out to the family

117
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,540
of the young man who perished,

118
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,280
and my personal prayers of thanks go out, as well,

119
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,360
because I believe he died

120
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,300
trying to protect my daughter.

121
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,710
And now, as time heals all our wounds,

122
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,000
we should reflect on what this tragedy means

123
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,760
to us as a church...

124
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,380
..as a community,

125
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,030
and as a family.

126
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,450
The loss of a young person

127
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,140
is particularly tragic.

128
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,130
A life unlived

129
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,730
is the saddest

130
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:40,920
of passings.

131
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,430
So, please, let us pray for peace,

132
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,270
for guidance,

133
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,250
and for the power to protect our children.

134
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,900
I can't. It's sunday night.

135
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,320
It's just us girls.

136
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,590
We're gonna do tequila shots and watch "reality bites."

137
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,120
My dad makes dinnerevery sunday night.

138
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,220
Come on, lori.

139
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,640
I know this has been hard,

140
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,120
but you are allowed to have fun.

141
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,480
I'll try.

142
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,630
Okay.

143
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,390
Are you lori?

144
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:22,860
Yeah.

145
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,350
My name is Sam.

146
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,590
This is my brother, Dean.

147
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,350
We just transferred hereto the university.

148
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,940
I saw you inside.

149
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,130
We don't want to bother you. We just

150
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,850
heard about what happened.

151
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,600
We wanted to say how sorry we were.

152
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,210
I kind of know what you're going through.

153
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,020
I-I saw

154
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,420
someone get hurt once.

155
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,680
It's something you don't forget.

156
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,010
Dad, hum...

157
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,950
This is Sam and Dean.

158
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,290
They're new students.

159
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,700
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

160
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,660
I must say that was an inspiring sermon.

161
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,800
Thank you very much.

162
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,400
It's so nice to find young people

163
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,730
who are open to the lord's message.

164
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,690
Listen, we're new in town, actually,

165
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,220
and we're looking for a...

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,590
tell me, Lori, what are the police saying?

167
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,200
Well, they don't have a lot to go on.

168
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,810
I think they blame me for that.

169
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,870
What do you mean?

170
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,330
My story.

171
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,560
I was so scared, I...

172
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,410
guess I was seeing things.

173
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,590
That doesn't mean it wasn't real.

174
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,540
So you believe her?

175
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,780
I do.

176
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,930
And I think she's hot, too.

177
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,740
No, man, there's something in her eyes.

178
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,280
And listen to this.

179
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,800
She heard scratching on the roof

180
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,870
and found the bloody body

181
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,410
suspended upside down over the car.

182
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,210
Bloody body suspended? That sounds like

183
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,810
the hookman legend.

184
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,810
That's one of the most famous urban legends.

185
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,570
You don't think that we're dealing with the hookman.

186
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,190
Every urban legend has a source,

187
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,570
a place where it all began.

188
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,750
What about the scratches and the tire punctures

189
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,960
and the invisible killer?

190
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,550
Maybe the hookman isn't a man at all.

191
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,850
What if it's some kind of spirit?

192
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,770
Here you go.

193
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,960
Arrest records going back to

194
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,820
1851.

195
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,240
Thanks.

196
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,330
Okay.

197
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,090
This is how you spent four good years of your life, huh?

198
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,770
Welcome to higher education.

199
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,210
Hey, check this out.

200
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:32,990
a preacher

201
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,480
named Jacob Karns was arrested for murder.

202
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,580
He was so angry over the red-light district in town

203
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,370
that one night he killed 13 prostitutes.

204
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,710
"Some of the deceased were found in their beds,

205
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,710
"sheets soaked with blood,

206
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,910
others suspended upside down from the limbs of trees

207
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,770
as a warning against sins of the flesh."

208
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,960
Get this he murder weapon?

209
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,530
Looks like the preacher lost his hand in an accident,

210
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,200
had it replaced with a silver hook.

211
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,310
Look where all this happened.

212
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,200
9 mile road.

213
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,870
Same place where the frat boy was killed.

214
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,130
Nice job, Dr. Venkman.

215
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,350
Let's check it out.

216
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,760
I know this is your first time really living alone

217
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,870
since mom died.

218
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,740
That's not it. I worry about you.

219
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,080
There are 22 girls in there. I'm perfectly safe.

220
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,530
That's what I'm worried about.

221
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,970
You don't think I know what goes on in there?

222
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,240
Dad, do we have to have this argument again?

223
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,460
I'm over 18. I can live my own life.

224
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,870
Which means partying with that roommate of yours.

225
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,320
I'm an adult. I can take care of myself.

226
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:42,870
Good night.

227
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,660
Lori. Lori, come

228
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,790
Lori.

229
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,390
Taylor, are you awake?

230
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,090
Here you go.

231
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,610
If it is a spirit, buckshot won't do much good.#

232
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,480
Yeah. Rock salt.

233
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:12,950
Hmm.

234
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,380
Salt being a spirit deterrent.

235
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,770
Yep.

236
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,180
It won't kill 'em, but it'll slow 'em down.

237
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,930
That's pretty good. You and dad think of this?

238
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,200
I told you,

239
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,250
you don't have to be a college graduate to be a genius.

240
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,640
Over there, over there.

241
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,410
Put the gun down now! Now!

242
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,760
Hands behind your head!

243
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,030
Wait, wait, wait! Okay, okay.

244
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,970
Get down on your knees! Come on, do it!

245
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,860
On your knees.

246
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,880
Get down on your bellies. Come on, do it.

247
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,410
He had the gun.

248
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,760
Oh, my god!

249
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,950
Saved your ass.

250
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,450
Talked the sheriff down to a fine, dude.

251
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,760
I'm Matlock. But how?

252
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,800
Told him you were a dumb-ass pledge

253
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,920
and that we were hazing you.

254
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,370
What about the shotgun?

255
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,020
I said that you were hunting ghosts

256
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,850
and that spirits are repelled by rock salt.

257
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,860
You know, typical hell week prank.

258
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,680
And he believed you?

259
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,220
Well, you look like a dumb-ass pledge.

260
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,760
I just want to take her home.

261
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,980
I understand, reverend,

262
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,130
but Lori's now connected to two murders

263
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,040
and I can't ignore that.

264
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,410
Listen to me.

265
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,600
Arrest her now or let me take her home.

266
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,210
Make sure she's available for questioning.

267
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,440
Thank you.

268
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,620
Sweet heart, give it normal.

269
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,600
Okay.

270
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,330
Here we go.

271
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,430
Why would the hookman have come here?

272
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,140
This is a long way from 9 mile road.

273
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,990
Maybe he's not haunting the scene of his crime.

274
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,380
Maybe it's about something else.

275
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,260
Dude, sorority girls.

276
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,890
Think we'll see a naked pillow fight?

277
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:02,970
Try and be quiet, will you?

278
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,230
Me be quiet? You be quiet.

279
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,230
"Aren't you glad you didn't turn on the light?"

280
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,310
That's right out of the legend.

281
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,190
Yeah, that's classic hookman, all right.

282
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,980
It's definitely a spirit.

283
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,110
Yeah.

284
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,730
I've never smelled ozone this strong before.

285
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,320
Hey, come here.

286
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,610
Does that look familiar to you?

287
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,620
It's the same symbol.

288
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,260
Seems like it is the spirit of Jacob Karns.

289
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,580
Let's find the Dude's grave,

290
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,420
salt and burn the bones, and put him down.

291
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,120
"After execution, Jacob Karns was laid to rest

292
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,990
in old north cemetery

293
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,200
in an unmarked grave."

294
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,950
Super.

295
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,330
Okay, so, we know it's Jacob Karns,

296
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,040
but we still don't know where he'll manifest next.

297
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,560
Or why.

298
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,500
I'll take a wild guess about why.

299
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,860
I think your friend Lori has something to do with this.

300
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,640
You've been holding out on me.

301
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,330
This college thing is awesome!

302
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,670
This wasn't really my experience.

303
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,800
Let me guess

304
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,610
library, studying, straight as.

305
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,820
What a geek.

306
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,110
Did you do your homework?

307
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,570
Yeah, it was bugging me.

308
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,060
How is the hookman tied with Lori?

309
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,080
I think I came up with something.

310
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,440
1932 "clergyman arrested for murder."

311
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,860
1967 "seminarian held in hippie rampage."

312
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,640
There's a pattern here.

313
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,540
In both cases, the suspect was a man of religion

314
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,420
who openly preached against immorality

315
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,230
and then found himself wanted for killings

316
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,230
he claimed were the work of an invisible force,

317
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,150
killings carried out get this

318
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,760
with a sharp instrument.

319
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,010
What's the connection to Lori?

320
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,840
A man of religion

321
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,940
who openly preaches against immorality.

322
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,620
Except this time instead of saving the whole town,

323
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,230
he's just trying to save his only daughter.

324
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,420
Reverend Sorenson.

325
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,310
Do you think he's summoning the spirit?

326
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,450
Maybe.

327
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,180
Or you know how a poltergeist

328
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,850
can haunt a person instead of a place?

329
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,570
The spirit latches onto the reverend's repressed emotions,

330
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,380
feeds off them.

331
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,820
Without the reverend ever even knowing it.

332
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,350
Either way, you should keep an eye on Lori tonight.

333
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:58,830
What about you?

334
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,420
I'm gonna go see if I can find that unmarked grave.

335
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,000
Here we go.

336
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,090
That's it.

337
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,640
Next time,

338
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,240
I get to watch the cute girl's house.

339
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,140
Hello, preacher.

340
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,550
I saw you from upstairs.

341
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,330
What are you doing here?

342
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,960
I'm keeping an eye on the place.

343
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,750
I was worried.

344
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,090
About me?

345
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,400
Yeah, sorry.

346
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,700
No, it's cool.

347
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,410
I already called the cops.

348
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,270
No, seriously, I think you're sweet,

349
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,700
which is probably why you should run away from me

350
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,920
as fast as you can.

351
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,260
Why would you say that?

352
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,980
It's like I'm cursed or something.

353
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,410
People around me keep dying.

354
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,850
I think I know how you feel.

355
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,330
Goodbye, preacher.

356
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,300
No one will talk to me anymore...

357
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,230
except you.

358
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,440
The sheriff thinks I'm a suspect.

359
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,830
And you know what my dad will say?

360
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,670
"Pave faith."

361
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,750
What does he know about faith?

362
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,170
I heard you guys fighting before.

363
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,340
He's seeing a woman,

364
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,070
a married woman.

365
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,590
I just found out.

366
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,720
She comes to our church with her husband,

367
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,600
I know her kids,

368
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,150
and he talks to me about religion,

369
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,470
about morality?

370
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,700
It's like on one hand, you know,

371
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,900
just do what you want and be happy,

372
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,780
but he taught me

373
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,220
raised me to believe that

374
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,900
if you do something wrong,

375
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,050
you will get punished.

376
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,120
I just don't know what to think anymore.

377
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,280
Sam?

378
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,460
Lori, I can't.

379
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,020
That someone you lost?

380
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,370
I'm sorry.

381
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,190
Lori.

382
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,350
Come inside, please.

383
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,030
I'll come in when I'm ready.

384
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,270
Ack! Aah!

385
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,300
No! No!

386
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,230
Dad!

387
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,730
It's okay. It's all right.

388
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,140
It's okay. It's okay.

389
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,520
We were just talking.

390
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,690
Then Lori's dad came out,

391
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,850
and then he appeared.

392
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,160
A big man

393
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,610
carrying a weapon, some kind of a hook?

394
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,750
Yes, sir.

395
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,610
Ever seen him before?

396
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,240
No, sir.

397
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,180
Son, it seems every time I turn around, I'm seeing you.

398
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,680
I suggest you try to stay out of trouble.

399
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,040
Yes, sir.

400
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,110
It's all right. I'm with him.

401
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:30,700
That's my brother. Hey, brother.

402
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,750
Let him through.

403
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,200
Thanks.

404
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,510
Go ahead.

405
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,440
You okay?

406
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,970
Yeah.

407
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,460
What the hell happened?

408
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,680
Hookman.

409
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,770
You saw him?

410
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,550
Damn right.

411
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,680
Why didn't you torch the bones?

412
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,170
You talk about I did.

413
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,020
You sure it's the spirit of Jacob Karns?

414
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,730
Sure as hell looked like him. And that's not all.

415
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,010
I don't think the spirit is latching onto the reverend.

416
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,340
Yeah, the guy wouldn't send the hookman after himself.

417
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,570
I think it's latching onto Lori.

418
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,750
Last night she found out that her father

419
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,530
is having an affair with a married woman.

420
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,640
So what?

421
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,670
So, she's upset about it.

422
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,870
She's upset about the immorality of it.

423
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,590
She was raised to believe

424
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,500
that if you do something wrong, you get punished.

425
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,870
Okay, so she's conflicted,

426
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,650
and the spirit of preacher Karns

427
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,160
is latching onto her emotions

428
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,600
and doing the punishing for her.

429
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,590
Right.

430
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,300
Rich comes on too strong.

431
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,250
Taylor tries to make her into a party girl.

432
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,030
Dad has an affair.

433
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,280
Remind me not to piss this girl off.

434
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,380
But I burned those bones. I buried them in salt.

435
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,720
Why didn't that stop him?

436
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,410
You must've missed something.

437
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,850
No, I burned everything in that coffin.

438
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,360
Did you get the hook?

439
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:50,920
The hook?

440
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,600
It was the murder weapon,

441
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,490
and in a way it was part of him.

442
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,590
So, like the bones,

443
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,030
the hook is a source of his power.

444
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,420
So, if we find the hook...

445
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,250
both: We stop the hookman.

446
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,360
Here's something,I think.

447
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,610
Logbook, Iowa state penitentiary.

448
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,630
"Karns, Jacob

449
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,870
personal affects, disposition thereof."

450
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:21,700
Does it mention the hook?

451
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,850
"Upon execution, all earthly items shall be remanded

452
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,050
"to the prisoner's house of worship,

453
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,420
St. Barnabas church."

454
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,360
Isn't that where Lori's father preaches?

455
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:31,880
Yeah.

456
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,230
Where Lori lives?

457
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,580
That's why the hookman's been haunting reverends

458
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,620
and reverends' daughters for the past 200 years.

459
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,590
Yeah but if the hook were at the church or Lori's house,

460
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,920
don't you think someone might've seen it?

461
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,780
I mean, a blood-stained, silver-handled hook?

462
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,860
Check the church records.

463
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,670
"St. Barnabas donations,1862.

464
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,420
Received silver-handled hook

465
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,740
from state penitentiary.

466
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,570
Reforged."

467
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,470
They melted it down,

468
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,190
made it into something else.

469
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,690
All right. We can't take any chances.

470
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,090
Anything silver goes in the fire.

471
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,590
I agree.

472
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,600
So Lori's still at the hospital.

473
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,590
We'll have to break in.

474
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,010
All right, take your pick.

475
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,570
I'll take the house.

476
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,580
Okay.

477
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,140
Hey.

478
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,100
Stay out of her underwear drawer.

479
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,980
I got everything that even looks silver.

480
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,980
Better safe than sorry.

481
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,260
Move, move.

482
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,090
Lori?

483
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,090
What are you doing here?

484
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,870
What is it?

485
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,850
I've been trying to understand what's been happening,

486
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,960
why?

487
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,880
Now I know, so I'm praying for forgiveness.

488
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,290
Forgiveness for what?

489
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,910
Don't you see?

490
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,630
I'm to blame for all this.

491
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,340
I've read in the bible about avenging angels.

492
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,730
Trust me. This guy,

493
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,080
he's no angel.

494
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,300
I was so angry at my father.

495
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,880
Part of me wanted him punished,

496
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:17,170
and then he came and he punished him.

497
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,710
It's not your fault.

498
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,390
Yes, it is.

499
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,330
I don't know how, but it is.

500
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,620
I killed rich.

501
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,950
Taylor, too.

502
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,880
I nearly killed my father.

503
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:27,970
Lori.

504
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,120
I can see it now.

505
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,800
They didn't deserve to be punished.

506
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,000
I do.

507
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,310
Come on. We got to go.

508
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,070
Go!

509
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,380
Come on!

510
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,800
No!

511
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,520
Come on, get up.

512
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,960
Sam, drop!

513
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,430
I thought we got all the silver.

514
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,250
Why is he still here?

515
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,600
Maybe we missed something.

516
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,120
Lori, where did you get that chain?

517
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,860
My father gave it to me.

518
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:05,850
Where'd your dad get it?

519
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,700
It was a church heirloom. He gave it to me.

520
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,120
Is it silver?

521
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,590
Yes.

522
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,240
Sam.

523
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,690
And you saw him, too, the man with the hook?

524
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,430
Yes, I told you. We all saw him.

525
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,240
We fought him off, and then he ran.

526
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,480
And that's all?

527
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,010
Yeah, that's all.

528
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,690
Listen, you and your brother

529
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,070
oh, don't worry. We're leaving town.

530
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,800
You gonna be okay?

531
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,610
Yeah.

532
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,840
I still don't know what happened,

533
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,940
but...

534
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,180
I do know you saved my life.

535
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,610
My father's, too.

536
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,060
Thank you.

537
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,850
We could stay.
