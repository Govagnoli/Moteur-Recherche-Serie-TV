1
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,589
Man, these are some phat houses, huh?

2
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:02,028
I'd like to live here.

3
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:02,668
Yeah.

4
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,687
Too bad you can't afford it.

5
00:01:05,596 --> 00:01:06,716
Yeah, you're right.

6
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,604
This neighborhood will be damn expensive when it's done.

7
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,500
This place is perfect...

8
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:35,460
ow!

9
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,728
...Except for the mosquitoes.

10
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:42,346
Aah!

11
00:01:43,455 --> 00:01:43,915
Dustin?

12
00:01:44,964 --> 00:01:46,244
Help me, I'm trapped!

13
00:01:47,153 --> 00:01:48,372
I broke my ankle.

14
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:50,841
I'll get a rope!

15
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,229
Oh, damn.

16
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,549
Oh god!

17
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:23,113
Travis, help!

18
00:02:23,263 --> 00:02:24,022
Hang on!

19
00:02:33,897 --> 00:02:35,306
Travis, help!

20
00:02:35,746 --> 00:02:37,465
Aah! Aaah!

21
00:02:37,485 --> 00:02:39,144
It's okay, Dustin. It's okay.

22
00:02:42,432 --> 00:02:42,962
Dustin?

23
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:45,241
Dustin, I'm here.

24
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:48,149
Oh, god.

25
00:02:55,715 --> 00:02:57,384
I got something to say.

26
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:13,945
ow!

27
00:03:16,353 --> 00:03:17,493
Yeah, you're doing all right.

28
00:03:17,503 --> 00:03:19,052
gonna start a fire

29
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,019
You know, we could get day jobs once in a while.

30
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:25,918
Hunting's our day job,

31
00:03:26,418 --> 00:03:27,487
and the pay is crap.

32
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:28,836
Yeah, but hustling pool,

33
00:03:29,536 --> 00:03:30,405
credit-card scams?

34
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:32,654
It's not the most honest thing in the world, Dean.

35
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:33,893
Well, let's see... Honest...

36
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:35,513
fun and easy...

37
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:37,781
It's no contest.

38
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:38,371
Besides,

39
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:40,200
we're good at it.
It's what we were raised to do.

40
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,948
- How we were raised was jacked.
- Yeah, says you.

41
00:03:43,368 --> 00:03:44,907
- We got a new gig or what?
- Maybe.

42
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:47,656
Oasis Plains, Oklahoma.
Not far from here.

43
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,235
Gas-company employee.

44
00:03:49,974 --> 00:03:51,634
Dustin Burwash,

45
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:54,062
supposedly died from creutzfeldt-jakob.

46
00:03:54,382 --> 00:03:54,702
Huh?

47
00:03:55,332 --> 00:03:57,400
- Human mad cow disease.
- Mad cow?

48
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,749
Wasn't that on "Oprah"?

49
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:01,248
You watch "Oprah"?

50
00:04:04,396 --> 00:04:07,085
So this guy eats a bad burger.
Why is it our kind of thing?

51
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:10,903
Mad cow disease causes massive brain degeneration.

52
00:04:10,903 --> 00:04:13,271
It takes months, even years
for the damage to appear,

53
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:14,401
but this guy, Dustin,

54
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:17,079
sounds like his brain disintegrated
in about an hour,

55
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,289
maybe less.

56
00:04:18,309 --> 00:04:19,728
- Okay, that's weird.
- Yeah.

57
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:21,417
Now, it could be a disease,

58
00:04:22,047 --> 00:04:23,506
or it could be something much nastier.

59
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:25,974
All right, Oklahoma.

60
00:04:26,594 --> 00:04:28,013
Man, work, work, work.

61
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,222
No time to spend my money.

62
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:35,029
We got the power, we got the glory

63
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,188
Just say you need it...

64
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:45,583
Travis Weaver?

65
00:04:47,263 --> 00:04:48,022
Yeah, that's right.

66
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:51,270
Are you the Travis who worked with uncle Dusty?

67
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,889
Dustin never mentioned nephews.

68
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:54,998
Really?

69
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,587
Well, he sure mentioned you.

70
00:04:56,627 --> 00:04:58,027
He said you were the greatest.

71
00:04:58,456 --> 00:04:59,186
Oh, he did?

72
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:00,275
Huh.

73
00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:02,674
So, we wanted to ask you...

74
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:04,333
what exactly happened out there?

75
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:06,502
I'm not sure.

76
00:05:06,952 --> 00:05:09,530
He fell in the sinkhole.
I went to the truck to get some rope, and

77
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,289
by the time I got back...

78
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:13,128
What'd you see?

79
00:05:14,577 --> 00:05:15,007
Nothing.

80
00:05:15,697 --> 00:05:16,406
Just Dustin.

81
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:18,135
No wounds or anything?

82
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:19,445
Well, he was bleeding

83
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:21,943
from his eyes and his ears, his nose,

84
00:05:22,803 --> 00:05:23,272
that's it.

85
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:25,591
So do you think it could be this whole mad cow thing?

86
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:27,860
I don't know.

87
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,599
That's what the doctors are saying.

88
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:30,528
But if it was,

89
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:35,296
he would have acted strange beforehand,
like dementia, loss of motor control.

90
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:37,215
- You ever notice anything like that?
- No.

91
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:38,104
No way.

92
00:05:39,293 --> 00:05:41,502
Yeah, but if it wasn't some disease,
what the hell was it?

93
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:43,491
That's a good question.

94
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:44,041
Yep.

95
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:45,610
Can you tell us where this happened?

96
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:46,729
Yeah.

97
00:06:09,697 --> 00:06:10,146
Huh.

98
00:06:11,635 --> 00:06:12,335
What do you think?

99
00:06:13,095 --> 00:06:13,974
I don't know,

100
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:16,493
but if that guy Travis was right,
it happened pretty damn fast.

101
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:18,032
So what?

102
00:06:18,342 --> 00:06:19,941
Some sort of creature chewed on his brain?

103
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:21,330
No, there'd be an entry wound.

104
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,379
Sounds like this thing worked from the inside.

105
00:06:27,077 --> 00:06:27,587
Huh.

106
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:30,465
It looks like there's only room for one.

107
00:06:31,245 --> 00:06:32,274
You want to flip a coin?

108
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:35,442
Dean, we have no idea what's down there.

109
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:38,351
All right, I'll go if you're scared.

110
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,590
Scared?

111
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,049
Flip the damn coin.

112
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:45,397
Call it in the air...

113
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:46,206
chicken.

114
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:48,735
I'm going.

115
00:06:48,805 --> 00:06:49,684
I said I'd go.

116
00:06:49,984 --> 00:06:50,954
I'm going.

117
00:06:51,373 --> 00:06:52,183
All right.

118
00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:55,321
Don't drop me.

119
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:01,358
So, you found some beetles

120
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,747
in a hole in the ground.

121
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:04,976
That's shocking, Sam.

122
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:07,454
There were no tunnels, no tracks,

123
00:07:07,854 --> 00:07:10,313
no evidence of any other kind of creature down there.

124
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:12,232
You know, some beetles do eat meat.

125
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:14,940
Now, it's usually dead meat, but...
- How many did you find down there?

126
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,650
10.

127
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:19,328
It would take a whole lot more than that
to eat out somebody's brain.

128
00:07:19,428 --> 00:07:20,607
Well, maybe there were more.

129
00:07:21,377 --> 00:07:22,956
I don't know. It sounds like a stretch to me.

130
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,724
We need more information on the area, the neighborhood,

131
00:07:25,744 --> 00:07:28,293
whether something like this has ever happened before.

132
00:07:30,202 --> 00:07:30,701
What?

133
00:07:31,391 --> 00:07:32,690
I know a good place to start.

134
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:36,398
I'm kind of hungry for a little barbecue,
how about you?

135
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,466
What, we can't talk to the locals?

136
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:43,584
- And the free food's got nothing to do with it?
- Of course not. I'm a professional.

137
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:44,624
Right.

138
00:08:03,873 --> 00:08:06,361
Growing up in a place like this would freak me out.

139
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:07,631
Why?

140
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,028
The manicured lawns, the"how was your day, honey?"...

141
00:08:12,128 --> 00:08:13,547
I'd blow my brains out.

142
00:08:14,957 --> 00:08:16,716
There's nothing wrong with normal.

143
00:08:17,905 --> 00:08:19,764
I'd take our family over normal any day.

144
00:08:23,842 --> 00:08:25,611
- Welcome.
- Is this the barbecue?

145
00:08:25,711 --> 00:08:27,869
Yeah, not the best weather, but...

146
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,647
- I'm Larry Pike, the developer here, and you are?
- Dean. This is Sam.

147
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:32,597
Sam, Dean, good to meet you.

148
00:08:32,297 --> 00:08:34,806
- So, you two are interested in Oasis Plains?
- Yes, sir.

149
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:36,145
Let me just say

150
00:08:36,245 --> 00:08:39,603
that we accept homeowners
of any race,religion, color, or...

151
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,442
sexual orientation.

152
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:44,000
We're brothers.

153
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,468
Our father is getting on in years,
and we're just looking for a place for him.

154
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:49,138
Great,

155
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:51,366
great. Well, seniors are welcome, too.
Come on in.

156
00:08:57,313 --> 00:08:58,802
You said you were the developer?

157
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:01,781
18 months ago, I was walking this valley with my survey team.

158
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,789
There was nothing here but scrub brush and squirrels,

159
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:07,497
and you know what?
We built such a nice place to live

160
00:09:07,707 --> 00:09:10,096
that I actually bought into it myself.
This is our house.

161
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:14,344
We're the first family in Oasis Plains.
This is my wife, Joanie.

162
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:15,253
- Hi, there.
- Hi,

163
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:16,792
- nice to meet you.
- Sam and Dean.

164
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:18,211
- Sam.
- Joannie.

165
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:19,930
Tell them how much you love the place, honey.

166
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,139
And lie if you have to because I need to sell some houses.

167
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:25,607
Boys, if you'll excuse me.

168
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:29,845
Don't let his salesman routine scare you.
This really is a great place to live.

169
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:31,804
Hi, I'm Linda Bloom, head of sales.

170
00:09:31,894 --> 00:09:33,473
And Linda was second to move in.

171
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,302
She's a very noisy neighbor, though.

172
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:38,260
She's kidding, of course.

173
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,039
I take it you two are interested in becoming homeowners.

174
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:42,908
- Well...
- Y-yeah.

175
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:47,915
Well, let me just say that we accept homeowners
of any race, religion, color,or...

176
00:09:48,774 --> 00:09:50,223
sexual orientation.

177
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:51,053
Hmm.

178
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:51,893
Right.

179
00:09:52,252 --> 00:09:54,281
Uh, I'm gonna go talk to Larry.

180
00:09:54,591 --> 00:09:55,431
Okay, honey?

181
00:10:00,888 --> 00:10:02,397
You have three choices...

182
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:04,476
carpet, hardwood, and tile.

183
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:05,245
Whoa,

184
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:07,214
someone likes bugs.

185
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:10,732
My son. He's into insects.

186
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:12,891
He's very inquisitive.

187
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,200
Hmm.

188
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,458
Who can say no to a steam shower?
I use mine every day.

189
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:18,848
Sounds great.

190
00:10:18,977 --> 00:10:22,116
You also have three different whirlpool tubs
to choose from.

191
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,215
The hardware for the tubs include nickel, brass,

192
00:10:24,264 --> 00:10:27,143
- and when you see the kitchens, you can choose from...
- Excuse me.

193
00:10:27,183 --> 00:10:28,552
Um, okay.

194
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,415
Is this yours?

195
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,324
- You gonna tell my dad?
- I don't know.

196
00:10:43,504 --> 00:10:44,413
Who's your dad?

197
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:45,752
Yeah.

198
00:10:45,852 --> 00:10:48,401
Larry usually skips me in the family introductions.

199
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:51,929
Ouch. First-name basis with the old man...
sounds pretty grim.

200
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:53,828
Well, I'm not exactly brochure material.

201
00:10:54,138 --> 00:10:56,407
Well, hang in there. It gets better.
Alright? I promise.

202
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:57,506
When?

203
00:10:57,536 --> 00:10:58,136
Matthew!

204
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:08,170
I am so sorry about my son and his...

205
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:08,870
- pet.
- It's no bother.

206
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:10,359
Excuse us.

207
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:18,464
Remind you of somebody?

208
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:23,661
Dad?

209
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:26,380
Dad never treated us like that.

210
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:29,148
Well, dad never treated you like that.
You were perfect.

211
00:11:29,158 --> 00:11:30,587
He was all over my case.

212
00:11:32,287 --> 00:11:33,426
You don't remember?

213
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:36,584
Maybe he had to raise his voice,
but sometimes you were out of line.

214
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:37,304
Right.

215
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:41,042
Right, like when I said I'd rather play soccer
than learn bow hunting.

216
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:42,721
Bow hunting's an important skill.

217
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,540
Whatever.

218
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,538
How was your tour?

219
00:11:47,718 --> 00:11:49,657
It was excellent.I'm ready to buy.

220
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:51,596
So you might be onto something.

221
00:11:52,205 --> 00:11:54,814
Looks like Dustin Burwash
wasn't the first strange death around here.

222
00:11:54,974 --> 00:11:55,544
What happened?

223
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:57,472
About a year ago, before they broke ground,

224
00:11:57,532 --> 00:11:59,691
one of Larry's surveyors dropped dead while on the job.

225
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:02,520
Get this... severe allergic reaction to bee stings.

226
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:04,019
- More bugs.
- More bugs.

227
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:08,766
I've heard of killer bees, but killer beetles?

228
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:10,775
What is it that could make different bugs attack?

229
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:15,303
Well, hauntings sometimes include bug manifestations.

230
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,721
Yeah, but I didn't see any evidence of ghost activity.

231
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:18,931
Yeah, me neither.

232
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,708
Maybe they're being controlled somehow...
by something or someone.

233
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:25,417
You mean like "Willard"?

234
00:12:25,447 --> 00:12:26,986
Yeah, bugs instead of rats.

235
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:33,792
There are cases of psychic connections
between people and animals, elementals, telepaths.

236
00:12:33,802 --> 00:12:35,811
Yeah, that whole Timmy/Lassie thing.

237
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,310
Larry's kid...

238
00:12:38,869 --> 00:12:40,079
bugs for pets.

239
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:41,648
- Matt?
- Yeah.

240
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,675
- He did try to scare the realtor with a tarantula.
- Think he's our willard?

241
00:12:46,855 --> 00:12:47,734
I don't know.

242
00:12:47,794 --> 00:12:49,374
Anything's possible, I guess.

243
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:53,291
Ooh, hey, pull over here.

244
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:03,196
What are we doing here?

245
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:08,463
It's too late to talk to anybody else.

246
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,651
We're gonna squat in an empty house?

247
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,139
I want to try the steam shower. Come on.

248
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:16,858
Come on!

249
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:46,742
Atoko valley county
began mandatory insecticide

250
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:49,400
spraying across a wide swath of the district today.

251
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,977
Authorities say the decision to spray
was made because of several recent cases of west nile virus,

252
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:59,324
coupled with a dramatic increase
in the mosquito population in some areas.

253
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:03,972
Although some residents cite concerns
about the high levels of pesticide being used...

254
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:31,447
Aaah! Aaah!

255
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:01,170
You ever coming out of there?

256
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,199
What?!

257
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,328
- Dean, a police call came in on the scanner.
- Hold on.

258
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:08,146
Someone was found dead three blocks from here.
Come on.

259
00:15:10,615 --> 00:15:12,044
This shower is awesome.

260
00:15:12,274 --> 00:15:13,113
Come on.

261
00:15:40,368 --> 00:15:42,427
Okay, look, I don't know anything more right now.

262
00:15:42,477 --> 00:15:44,036
I'll have to call you back.

263
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:44,856
All right.

264
00:15:46,215 --> 00:15:47,884
Hello, you're back early.

265
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:51,392
- Yeah, we wanted to take another look at the neighborhood.
- What's going on?

266
00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:00,517
You guys met Linda Bloom at the barbecue?

267
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:01,486
The realtor.

268
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:03,035
Well, she, uh,

269
00:16:03,895 --> 00:16:05,064
passed away last night.

270
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:07,133
What happened?

271
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:09,682
I'm still trying to find out.

272
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:11,950
I identified the body for the police.

273
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,089
I'm sorry. This isn't a good time.

274
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:15,918
It's okay.

275
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:16,918
Excuse me.

276
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,425
You know what we have to do, right?

277
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:25,023
- We got to get in that house.
- See if we got a bug problem.

278
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:53,038
This looks like the place.

279
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,040
Spiders.

280
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:08,879
From spider boy?

281
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:09,778
Matt.

282
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:12,277
Maybe.

283
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:36,054
Isn't his house that way?

284
00:17:36,114 --> 00:17:37,033
Yep.

285
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:41,860
So where's he going?

286
00:18:06,387 --> 00:18:07,726
Hey, Matt.

287
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,475
Remember me?

288
00:18:10,404 --> 00:18:11,334
What are you doing out here?

289
00:18:11,454 --> 00:18:12,773
We want to talk to you.

290
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:15,781
You're not here to buy a house, are you?

291
00:18:16,781 --> 00:18:17,510
Wait,

292
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,549
you're not serial killers?

293
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:21,908
No, no. No, I think you're safe.

294
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:24,177
So, Matt...

295
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:27,055
you sure know a lot about insects.

296
00:18:28,144 --> 00:18:28,694
So?

297
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:31,902
Did you hear what happened to Linda, the realtor?

298
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:34,971
I hear she died this morning.

299
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:36,190
Mm, that's right.

300
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,739
Spider bites.

301
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:39,298
Matt,

302
00:18:40,128 --> 00:18:42,337
you tried to scare her with a spider.

303
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:44,475
Wait,

304
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:46,524
you think I had something to do with that?

305
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,113
You tell us.

306
00:18:48,883 --> 00:18:50,792
That tarantula was a joke.

307
00:18:51,372 --> 00:18:54,730
Anyway, that wouldn't explain the bee attack
or the gas-company guy.

308
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,288
You know about those?

309
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,027
There is something going on here.

310
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:00,526
I don't know what,

311
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:01,086
but

312
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:03,245
something's happening with the insects.

313
00:19:03,505 --> 00:19:04,924
Let me show you something.

314
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,358
So, if you knew about all this bug stuff,
why not tell your dad?

315
00:19:15,468 --> 00:19:17,227
Maybe he could clear everybody out.

316
00:19:17,387 --> 00:19:19,036
Believe me, I've tried, but

317
00:19:19,286 --> 00:19:20,985
Larry doesn't listen to me.

318
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:21,855
Why not?

319
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,144
Mostly?

320
00:19:23,284 --> 00:19:25,193
He's too disappointed in his freak son.

321
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:27,781
I hear ya.

322
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:29,160
You do?

323
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:32,499
Matt, how old are you?

324
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:33,328
16.

325
00:19:34,617 --> 00:19:37,276
Well, don't sweat it 'cause in two years
something great's gonna happen.

326
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,185
- What?
- College.

327
00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:42,163
You'll be able to get out of that house
and away from your dad.

328
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:45,142
What kind of advice is that?
A kid should stick with his family.

329
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:51,058
How much further, Matt?

330
00:19:51,228 --> 00:19:52,198
We're close.

331
00:20:12,706 --> 00:20:14,835
I've been keeping track of the insect population.
It's

332
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:16,734
part of an A.P. Science class.

333
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:19,253
You two are like peas in a pod.

334
00:20:21,231 --> 00:20:22,131
What's been happening?

335
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:23,140
A lot.

336
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,229
I mean, from bees to earthworms,

337
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:27,728
beetles...

338
00:20:27,848 --> 00:20:29,277
you name it. It's

339
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:31,056
like they're congregating here.

340
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:31,746
Why?

341
00:20:32,245 --> 00:20:33,135
I don't know.

342
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:36,423
What's that?

343
00:21:11,843 --> 00:21:12,983
There's something down there.

344
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,829
Oh, come on.

345
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,052
So, a bunch of skeletons in an unmarked grave.

346
00:22:14,843 --> 00:22:16,734
Yeah, maybe this is a haunting...

347
00:22:16,864 --> 00:22:18,104
some pissed-off spirits,

348
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:20,635
- some unfinished business.
- Yeah, maybe.

349
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:22,595
The question is, why bugs

350
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,736
and why now?

351
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,597
That's two questions.

352
00:22:26,868 --> 00:22:28,418
So, with that kid back there...

353
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:31,129
how could you tell him to just ditch his family like that?

354
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:32,479
Just, uh,

355
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,461
I know what the kid's going through.

356
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:38,112
- How about telling him to respect his old man? How's that for advice?
- Dean, come on.

357
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,402
This isn't about his old man.

358
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:41,733
You think I didn't respect dad.

359
00:22:41,844 --> 00:22:43,013
That's what this is about.

360
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:45,524
Just forget it. Sorry I brought it up.

361
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:46,565
I respected him,

362
00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:48,625
but no matter what I did,

363
00:22:48,856 --> 00:22:50,056
it was never good enough.

364
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,727
- What are you saying, that dad was disappointed in you?
- Was?

365
00:22:54,017 --> 00:22:54,817
Is...

366
00:22:55,278 --> 00:22:57,318
- always has been.
- Why would you think that?

367
00:22:57,358 --> 00:22:59,028
Because I didn't want to bow hunt

368
00:22:59,189 --> 00:23:02,020
or hustle pool, because I wanted to go
to school and live my life,

369
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,321
which in our whacked-out family made me the freak.

370
00:23:06,311 --> 00:23:08,552
Yeah, you were kind of like the blond chick in "the munsters."

371
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:10,454
Dean,

372
00:23:11,164 --> 00:23:13,614
you know what most dads are
when their kids score a full ride?

373
00:23:14,545 --> 00:23:15,236
Proud.

374
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:18,787
Most dads don't toss their kids out of the house.

375
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:21,278
I remember that fight.

376
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:24,949
In fact, I seem to recall a few choice phrases
coming out of your mouth.

377
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,301
You know,

378
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:33,372
truth is, when we finally do find dad,

379
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:36,213
I don't know if he's even gonna want to see me.

380
00:23:37,924 --> 00:23:39,845
Sam, dad was never disappointed in you.

381
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:41,695
Never.

382
00:23:42,905 --> 00:23:44,046
He was scared.

383
00:23:44,736 --> 00:23:45,866
What are you talking about?

384
00:23:45,906 --> 00:23:48,467
He was afraid of what could have happened to you
if he wasn't around.

385
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,569
But even when you two weren't talking,

386
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,519
he used to swing by Stanford whenever he could,

387
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,160
keep an eye on you,

388
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,112
make sure you were safe.

389
00:23:58,771 --> 00:23:59,681
What?

390
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:01,653
Yeah.

391
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,224
Why didn't he tell me any of that?

392
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,576
It's a two-way street, dude.
You could have picked up the phone.

393
00:24:17,128 --> 00:24:18,889
Come on, we're gonna be late for our appointment.

394
00:24:26,872 --> 00:24:28,322
So, you two are students?

395
00:24:28,732 --> 00:24:29,752
Yeah.

396
00:24:29,852 --> 00:24:32,014
Yeah, we're in your class.

397
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:33,513
Anthro 101.

398
00:24:33,893 --> 00:24:35,015
Oh, yeah.

399
00:24:35,085 --> 00:24:35,825
So,

400
00:24:35,895 --> 00:24:37,786
what about the bones, Professor?

401
00:24:38,626 --> 00:24:41,266
This is quite an interesting find you've made.

402
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:45,199
I'd say they're 170 years old, give or take.

403
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,518
The time frame and the geography

404
00:24:47,538 --> 00:24:49,380
heavily suggest native american.

405
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:53,011
Were there any tribes or reservations on that land?

406
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,681
Not according to the historical record,

407
00:24:55,751 --> 00:24:56,643
but

408
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,212
the, uh...

409
00:24:58,253 --> 00:25:02,234
relocation of native peoples was quite common at that time.

410
00:25:02,474 --> 00:25:03,185
Right.

411
00:25:03,955 --> 00:25:04,566
Well,

412
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:06,536
are there any local legends,

413
00:25:06,736 --> 00:25:08,856
oral histories about the area?

414
00:25:09,807 --> 00:25:10,938
Well...

415
00:25:11,528 --> 00:25:14,960
you know, there's a euchee tribe in Sapulpa.

416
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:16,860
It's about 60 miles from here.

417
00:25:18,211 --> 00:25:20,100
Someone out there might know the truth.

418
00:25:23,082 --> 00:25:24,082
All right.

419
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,769
Joe Whitetree?

420
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:14,311
We'd like to ask you a few questions, if that's all right.

421
00:26:14,891 --> 00:26:16,372
We're students from the university.

422
00:26:16,431 --> 00:26:18,402
No, you're not. You're lying.

423
00:26:20,363 --> 00:26:21,134
Um,

424
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:24,375
- the truth is...
- You know who starts sentence with

425
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:25,535
"truth is"?

426
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:25,655
Liars.

427
00:26:29,436 --> 00:26:31,137
Have you heard of Oasis Plains?

428
00:26:31,187 --> 00:26:33,547
It's a housing development near the Atoka valley.

429
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,158
I like him.

430
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,020
He's not a liar.

431
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,200
I know the area.

432
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:44,451
What can you tell us about the history there?

433
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:45,652
Why do you want to know?

434
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:47,493
Something...

435
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:48,913
something bad

436
00:26:49,744 --> 00:26:51,644
is happening in Oasis Plains.

437
00:26:52,575 --> 00:26:56,136
We think it might have something to do
with some old bones we found down there...

438
00:26:57,307 --> 00:26:58,727
native american bones.

439
00:27:03,408 --> 00:27:05,639
I'll tell you what my grandfather told me,

440
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:08,151
what his grandfather told him.

441
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,300
200 years ago,

442
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,202
a band of my ancestors lived in that valley.

443
00:27:13,922 --> 00:27:17,403
One day, the american calvary came to relocate them.

444
00:27:20,364 --> 00:27:21,906
They were resistant...

445
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,126
calvary impatient.

446
00:27:25,658 --> 00:27:27,367
As my grandfather put it,

447
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:29,158
on a night,

448
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,289
the moon

449
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:31,529
and the sun

450
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:33,970
shared the sky as equals,

451
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,801
the calvary first raided our village.

452
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:39,392
They murdered,

453
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:40,872
raped.

454
00:27:41,913 --> 00:27:44,183
The next day, the calvary came again,

455
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:46,484
and the next and the next.

456
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,855
And on the sixth night, the calvary came one last time,

457
00:27:50,956 --> 00:27:52,906
and by the time the sun rose,

458
00:27:53,077 --> 00:27:55,137
every man, woman, and child

459
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,868
still in the village

460
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,199
was dead.

461
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:04,420
They say on the sixth night,

462
00:28:04,571 --> 00:28:07,072
as the chief of the village lay dying,

463
00:28:07,412 --> 00:28:09,233
he whispered to the heavens

464
00:28:10,043 --> 00:28:13,255
that no white man would ever tarnish this land again.

465
00:28:14,145 --> 00:28:15,125
Nature

466
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,616
would rise up

467
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:18,786
and protect the valley,

468
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,927
and it would bring as many days of misery and death

469
00:28:22,477 --> 00:28:23,588
to the white man

470
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:26,258
as the calvary had brought upon his people.

471
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,060
Insects.

472
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,282
That sounds like nature to me.

473
00:28:32,781 --> 00:28:33,811
Six days?

474
00:28:34,072 --> 00:28:36,082
And on the night of the sixth day,

475
00:28:36,952 --> 00:28:38,524
none would survive.

476
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:48,497
When did the gas-company man die?

477
00:28:49,448 --> 00:28:51,968
Let's see, we got here tuesday, so friday the 20th.

478
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:53,329
March 20th.

479
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,630
That's the spring equinox.

480
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:58,581
The night, the sun and the moon share the sky as equals.

481
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:02,382
So every year about this time,
anybody in Oasis Plains is in danger.

482
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:06,473
- Larry built his neighborhood on cursed land.
- And on the sixth night... that's tonight.

483
00:29:06,794 --> 00:29:10,095
If we don't do something,
Larry's family will be dead by sunrise.

484
00:29:11,395 --> 00:29:12,746
So how do we break a curse?

485
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:12,836
You don't break a curse.

486
00:29:13,226 --> 00:29:14,586
You get out of its way.
We got to get those people out now.

487
00:30:33,004 --> 00:30:35,923
Yes, mr. Pike, there's a main-line gas leak
in your neighborhood.

488
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:37,509
God, really? And how big?

489
00:30:37,608 --> 00:30:40,258
Well, it's fairly extensive. I don't want to alarm you,
but

490
00:30:40,387 --> 00:30:44,083
we need your family out of the vicinity
for at least 12 hours or so, just to be safe.

491
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:45,190
And who is this again?

492
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,900
Travis Weaver. I work for Oklahoma gas and power.

493
00:30:47,949 --> 00:30:48,488
Uh-huh.

494
00:30:48,698 --> 00:30:52,414
The problemis I know Travis. He's worked with us for a year.
So who is this?

495
00:30:52,922 --> 00:30:53,908
Uh...

496
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:56,560
give me the phone.

497
00:31:05,267 --> 00:31:05,885
Hello?

498
00:31:05,994 --> 00:31:06,961
Matt, it's Sam.

499
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,182
Sam, my backyard's crawling with cockroaches.

500
00:31:09,182 --> 00:31:12,519
Matt, just listen. You have to get your family
out of that house right now, okay?

501
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:13,637
What, why?

502
00:31:14,494 --> 00:31:15,709
Because something's coming.

503
00:31:16,346 --> 00:31:17,143
More bugs.

504
00:31:17,483 --> 00:31:18,698
Yeah, a lot more.

505
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:21,787
My dad doesn't listen in the best of circumstances.

506
00:31:21,807 --> 00:31:24,667
- What am I supposed to tell him?
- You got to make him listen, okay?

507
00:31:24,856 --> 00:31:26,041
Give me the phone. Give me the phone!

508
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,300
Matt, under no circumstances are you to tell the truth.
He'll just think you're nuts.

509
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,870
- But he's my...
- Tell him you have a sharp pain in your right side,

510
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,444
and you got to go to the hospital, okay?

511
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:35,208
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

512
00:31:38,934 --> 00:31:39,931
"Make him listen."

513
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:41,674
What are you thinking?

514
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:54,917
Damn it, they're still here.
Come on.

515
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:04,613
Get off my property before I call the cops!

516
00:32:04,652 --> 00:32:06,285
- Mr. Pike, listen.
- Dad,

517
00:32:06,774 --> 00:32:07,760
they're just trying to help.

518
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:08,836
Get in the house!

519
00:32:09,364 --> 00:32:10,988
Sorry. I told him the truth.

520
00:32:11,037 --> 00:32:12,821
We had a plan, Matt. What happened to the plan?

521
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,152
Look, it's twelve a.m.

522
00:32:15,293 --> 00:32:16,638
They are coming any minute now.

523
00:32:16,698 --> 00:32:19,697
You need to get your family and go before it's too late.

524
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:23,463
Oh, yeah, you mean before the biblical swarm.

525
00:32:23,632 --> 00:32:25,982
What do you think really happened
to that realtor, huh?

526
00:32:26,124 --> 00:32:27,479
And the gas-company guy?

527
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:29,660
You don't think something weird's going on around here?

528
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:32,002
Look, I don't know who you are, but you're crazy.

529
00:32:32,012 --> 00:32:34,383
You come near my boy or my family again,

530
00:32:34,483 --> 00:32:35,518
we're gonna have a problem.

531
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:38,150
- Well, I hate to be a downer, but we got a problem right now.
- Dad, they're right.

532
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:39,256
We're in danger.

533
00:32:40,182 --> 00:32:42,115
Matt, get inside now!

534
00:32:42,483 --> 00:32:43,489
Why won't you listen to me?!

535
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:45,861
Because this is crazy! It doesn't make any sense!

536
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,688
Look,

537
00:32:46,947 --> 00:32:48,502
this land is cursed.

538
00:32:48,822 --> 00:32:52,099
People have died here.
Are you gonna really take that risk with your family?

539
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:52,607
Wait.

540
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,397
You hear it?

541
00:32:59,672 --> 00:33:00,678
What the hell?

542
00:33:05,131 --> 00:33:07,125
It's time to go. Larry, get your wife.

543
00:33:07,822 --> 00:33:08,220
Guys.

544
00:33:12,296 --> 00:33:13,351
Oh, my god.

545
00:33:15,354 --> 00:33:16,529
We'll never make it.

546
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:18,482
Everybody in the house.
Everybody in the house!

547
00:33:18,682 --> 00:33:19,329
Let's go!

548
00:33:24,092 --> 00:33:26,205
- Is there anyone else in the neighborhood?
- No, it's just us.

549
00:33:26,824 --> 00:33:27,969
Honey, what's happening?

550
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:29,522
What's that noise?

551
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:31,576
Call 911.

552
00:33:32,373 --> 00:33:33,219
Joanie!

553
00:33:33,468 --> 00:33:34,076
Okay.

554
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:36,826
I need towels.

555
00:33:36,936 --> 00:33:40,074
We got to lock this place up.
Come on, doors, windows, the fireplace, everything. Okay?

556
00:33:40,743 --> 00:33:41,728
Phones are dead.

557
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:43,113
They must have chewed through the phone lines.

558
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:50,068
And the power lines.

559
00:33:50,298 --> 00:33:51,124
Maybe my cell.

560
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,240
No signal.

561
00:33:55,777 --> 00:33:56,713
You won't get one.

562
00:33:57,422 --> 00:33:59,026
They're blanketing the house.

563
00:34:15,435 --> 00:34:16,452
So, what do we do now?

564
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,116
We try to outlast it.

565
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,750
- Hopefully the curse will end at sunrise.
- Hopefully?

566
00:34:44,938 --> 00:34:46,662
- Bug spray?
- Trust me.

567
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:50,050
What is that?

568
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:01,029
The flue.

569
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:05,463
I think everybody needs to get upstairs.

570
00:35:16,285 --> 00:35:18,467
Everybody upstairs now!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

571
00:35:21,714 --> 00:35:23,020
Quick!

572
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:33,920
Okay, Joanie, go, go, go.

573
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,867
Matt, go.

574
00:35:36,382 --> 00:35:37,427
Hurry!

575
00:35:43,964 --> 00:35:44,921
- You in?
- Yeah.

576
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:49,664
Come on!

577
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:57,395
My god, what's that?!

578
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:04,698
Something's eating through the wood.

579
00:36:06,072 --> 00:36:06,889
Termites.

580
00:36:11,165 --> 00:36:12,510
All right, everybody get back.

581
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:14,055
Get back! Get back!

582
00:36:14,085 --> 00:36:14,632
Get back!

583
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:16,425
Matt.

584
00:37:16,029 --> 00:37:18,331
Huddle together. Cover your faces.

585
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:29,450
Look!

586
00:38:28,645 --> 00:38:29,562
What, no goodbye?

587
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:30,877
Good timing.

588
00:38:30,987 --> 00:38:32,411
Another hour and we'd have been gone.

589
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:33,537
For good?

590
00:38:34,444 --> 00:38:35,032
Yeah.

591
00:38:35,093 --> 00:38:38,718
The development's been put on hold while the government investigates
those bones you found,

592
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:40,472
but I'm gonna make damn sure

593
00:38:40,602 --> 00:38:41,697
no one lives here again.

594
00:38:42,464 --> 00:38:43,870
You don't seem too upset about it.

595
00:38:45,055 --> 00:38:48,175
Well, this has been the biggest financial disaster
of my career, but,

596
00:38:49,549 --> 00:38:50,616
somehow...

597
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:53,714
I really don't care.

598
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,347
What's this?

599
00:39:09,566 --> 00:39:10,364
I don't know.

600
00:39:11,528 --> 00:39:12,197
They

601
00:39:12,456 --> 00:39:13,731
kind of weird me out now.

602
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:17,567
Yeah, I should hope so.

603
00:39:37,853 --> 00:39:38,900
I want to find dad.

604
00:39:40,643 --> 00:39:41,419
Yeah, me too.

605
00:39:42,975 --> 00:39:44,031
Yeah, but I just...

606
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,684
I want to apologize to him.

607
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:52,699
For what?

608
00:39:55,181 --> 00:39:56,835
All the things I said to him.

609
00:39:59,594 --> 00:40:01,010
He was just doing the best he could.

610
00:40:04,249 --> 00:40:05,802
Well, don't worry, we'll find him,

611
00:40:06,968 --> 00:40:08,373
and you'll apologize,

612
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,680
and within five minutes, you guys will
beat each other's throats.

613
00:40:15,626 --> 00:40:17,409
Yeah, probably.

614
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,585
- Let's hit the road.
- Let's.
