1
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,270
Come on, let's say good night to your brother.

2
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,910
- Night Sam.
- Good night, love.

3
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,790
Hey! Dean.

4
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,030
- Daddy!
- Hey buddy!

5
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,750
What do you think?
Sam is ready to toss around football yet?

6
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,550
- No, daddy.
- No?

7
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,430
- You got him?
- I got him.

8
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,080
Sweet dreams, Sammy.

9
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,320
- John?

10
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,040
John, is he hungry?

11
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,880
Okay.

12
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,480
Sammy!

13
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,360
Mary!

14
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,240
Mary!

15
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,560
Mary!

16
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,160
Hey, Sammy.

17
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,880
Okay?

18
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,560
Mary!

19
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,600
Daddy!

20
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,280
Take your brother outside
as fast as you can!

21
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,640
Don't look back!

22
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,800
Now, Dean!
Go!

23
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,220
It's okay, Sammy.

24
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:49,321
Got you.

25
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,830
I got it.
I got it.

26
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,220
Here.

27
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,520
Stay back.
You have to stay back.

28
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,680
Sam!

29
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,840
Get a move on, would you?

30
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
We were supposed to be there
like 15 minutes ago.

31
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,520
Sam, you're coming or what?

32
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,640
Do I have to?
Yes. It'll be fun.

33
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,240
And where's your costume?

34
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,040
You know how I feel
about Halloween.

35
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,000
So here's to Sam and his
awesome LSAT victory.

36
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,520
All right, all right.
It's not that big a deal.

37
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, he acts all humble,
but he scored a 174.

38
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,360
- Is that good?
- Scary good.

39
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,640
See, there you go.
You are a first-round draft pick.

40
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,920
You can go to any law school you want.

41
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,080
Actually, I got an interview here monday.

42
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,560
If it goes okay, I think I got
a shot at a full ride next year.

43
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,400
Hey, it's gonna go great.

44
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,480
It better.

45
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,800
How does it feel to be
the golden boy in your family?

46
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,840
They don't know.

47
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,560
No? I would be gloating.
Why not?

48
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,520
Because we're not exactly the Bradys.

49
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,840
I'm not exactly the Huxtables.
More shots?

50
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,360
- No.
- No. No.
- No!

51
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,580
Seriously, I'm proud of you, and you're...

52
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:40,380
gonna knock them dead on monday.

53
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,740
You're gonna get that full ride.

54
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,060
I know it.

55
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,180
What would I do without you?

56
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,770
Crash and burn.

57
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,030
Whoa! Easy, tiger.

58
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,390
Dean?

59
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,350
You scared the crap out of me.

60
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,750
That's because you're out of practice.

61
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,990
Or not.

62
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,550
Get off of me.

63
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,610
Dean, what the hell are you doing here?

64
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,730
I was looking for a beer.

65
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,010
What the hell are you doing here?

66
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,730
Ok, all right, we got to talk.

67
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,130
- The phone?
- If I'd called would you picked up?

68
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,300
Sam?

69
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,540
Jess, hey.

70
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,790
Dean, this is my girlfriend, Jessica.

71
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,270
Wait.
Your brother Dean?

72
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,510
I love the Smurfs.

73
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,730
You know, I got to tell you.

74
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:25,731
You are completely out of my brother's league.

75
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,150
Just let me put something on.

76
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,830
No, no.
No, I wouldn't dream of it, seriously.

77
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,830
Anyway, I got to borrow your boyfriend here...

78
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:34,830
talk about some private family business, but...

79
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,950
it's nice meeting you.

80
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,520
No.

81
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,400
No, whatever you want to say,
you can say it in front of her.

82
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,920
Okay.

83
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,570
Dad hasn't been home in a few days.

84
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,710
So? He's working overtime
on a "Miller Time" shift.

85
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:52,511
He'll stumble back in sooner or later.

86
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,910
Dad's on a hunting trip,

87
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,230
and he hasn't been home in a few days.

88
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,070
Jess, excuse us.

89
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,510
We have to go outside.

90
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,030
I mean, come on, you can't
just break in the middle...

91
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,230
of the night and expect me
to hit the road with you.

92
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,230
You're  not hearing me, Sammy.
Dad's missing.

93
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,990
I need you to help me find him.

94
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,690
You remember the poltergeist in Amherst?

95
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:18,991
Or the devil's gates in Clifton?

96
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,670
He was missing then, too.

97
00:08:20,671 --> 00:08:22,270
He's always missing, and he's always fine.

98
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,110
Not for this long.

99
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:24,511
Now, are you gonna come with me or not?

100
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,750
I'm not.

101
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,830
Why not?

102
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,070
I swore I was done hunting.
For good.

103
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,050
Come on, it wasn't easy, but it wasn't that bad.

104
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:32,051
Yeah?

105
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,030
When I told dad I was scared of the thing...

106
00:08:34,031 --> 00:08:35,631
in my closet, he gave me a .45.

107
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,710
What was he supposed to do?

108
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,590
I was 9 years old.

109
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,470
He was supposed to say:
"Don't be afraid of the dark."

110
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,030
"Don't be afraid of the dark"?
Are you kidding me?

111
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,010
Of course, you should be afraid.

112
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:45,111
You know what's out there.

113
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,210
Yeah I know but still...

114
00:08:46,211 --> 00:08:47,710
the way we grew up
after mom was killed...

115
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,150
and dad's obsession to find
the thing that killed her.

116
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,550
But we still haven't found the damn thing.

117
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,150
So we kill everything we can find.

118
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,470
Save a lot of people doing it, too.

119
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,630
You think mom would have wanted this for us?

120
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,150
The weapon training and
melting the silver into bullets?

121
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,670
Man, Dean, we were raised like warriors.

122
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,710
So, what are you gonna do?

123
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,510
Are you just gonna live some
normal, apple-pie life?

124
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,110
Is that it?

125
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,470
No, not normal.
Safe.

126
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,670
And that's why you ran away.

127
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,350
I was just going to college.

128
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,310
It was dad who said if I was gonna go...

129
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:25,511
I should stay gone.

130
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,990
And that's what I'm doing.

131
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,390
Dad's in real trouble right now...

132
00:09:29,391 --> 00:09:30,791
if he's not dead already.

133
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:31,792
I can feel it.

134
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,950
I can't do this alone.

135
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,510
Yes, you can.

136
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,510
Yeah.
Well, I don't want to.

137
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,950
What was he hunting?

138
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,670
All right. Let's see.
Where the hell did I put that thing?

139
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,630
So when dad left,
why didn't you go with him?

140
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,530
I  was working my own gig...

141
00:10:02,531 --> 00:10:04,231
This voodoo thing down in New Orleans.

142
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,150
Dad let you go on a hunting
trip by yourself?

143
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,910
I'm 26, dude.

144
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,910
All right, here we go.

145
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,770
So dad was checking out
this two-lane blacktop...

146
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:16,271
just outside of Jericho, California.

147
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,710
About a month ago, this guy...

148
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,790
They found his car, but he'd vanished.

149
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:20,991
Completely M.I.A.

150
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,270
So maybe he was kidnapped.

151
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,270
Yeah, well, here's another one in April...

152
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,330
another one in December '04, '03, '98, '92...

153
00:10:29,331 --> 00:10:30,631
10 of them over the past 20 years...

154
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,590
All men, all same 5-mile stretch of road.

155
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,590
Started happening more and more, so...

156
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,030
dad went to go dig around.

157
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,750
That was about three weeks ago.

158
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,430
I hadn't heard from him since,
which is bad enough,

159
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,590
and then I get this voice mail yesterday.

160
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,990
"Dean, something's starting to happen.
I think it's serious."

161
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,950
"I need to try to figure out what's going on."

162
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,630
"Be very careful, Dean.
We're all in danger."

163
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,710
You know there's EVP on that?

164
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,550
Not bad, Sammy.
Kind of like riding a bike, isn't it?

165
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,890
All right. I slowed the message down...

166
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:08,191
and ran it through a goldwave...

167
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,870
took out the hiss,
and this is what I got.

168
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,790
"I can never go home."

169
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,590
Never go home.

170
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,370
You know, in almost two years...

171
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:26,571
I've never bothered you...

172
00:11:26,572 --> 00:11:27,872
never asked you for a thing.

173
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,150
All right, I'll go.

174
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,430
I'll help you find him,

175
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,510
but I have to get back first thing Monday.

176
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,790
Just wait here.

177
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,750
What's first thing monday?

178
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,710
I've this...

179
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,110
I have an interview.

180
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,870
What? A job interview?
Skip it.

181
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,210
It's a law-school interview...

182
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:57,711
and it's my whole future on a plate.

183
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,670
Law school?

184
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,110
So we got a deal or not?

185
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,670
Wait, you're taking off?

186
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,350
Is this about your dad?
Is he all right?

187
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,790
Yeah. You know,
just a little family drama.

188
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,790
But your brother said he was on
some kind of hunting trip.

189
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,350
Yeah, he's just deer hunting up at the cabin,

190
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,630
and he's probably got Jim, Jack,
and Jose along with him.

191
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,190
We're just gonna go bring him back.

192
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,270
What about the interview?

193
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,150
I'll make the interview.

194
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,630
This is only for a couple days.

195
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,310
Sam, I mean, please.
Just stop for a second.

196
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,270
You're sure you're okay?

197
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,150
I'm fine.

198
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,110
It's just...
You want even talk about your family...

199
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,330
and now you're taking off
in the middle of the night...

200
00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:39,431
to spend the weekend with them.

201
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,350
And with Monday coming up...
It's just not kind of your style.

202
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,630
Hey, everything's gonna be okay.

203
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,430
I would be back in time, I promise.

204
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,470
At least tell me where you're going!

205
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,790
Amy, I can't come over tonight.

206
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,230
Because I got work in
the morning, that's why.

207
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,950
Okay, I miss it, my dad's
gonna have my ass.

208
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,990
Hey, uh, Amy, let me call you back.

209
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,190
Car trouble or something?

210
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,110
Take me home.

211
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,790
Sure, get in.

212
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,710
So where do you live?

213
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,030
At the end of Breckenridge Road.

214
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,270
You're coming from a Halloween
party or something?

215
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,630
You know, um, a girl like you
really shouldn't be alone out here.

216
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,150
I'm with you.

217
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,150
Do you think I'm pretty?

218
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,470
Will you come home with me?

219
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,390
Um...Hell, yeah.

220
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,510
Come on.
You don't live here.

221
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,350
I can never go home.

222
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:19,590
What? What are you talking about?
Nobody lives here.

223
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,590
Huh, where do you live?

224
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,950
That's good.

225
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,190
Joke's over, okay?

226
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,910
You want me to leave?

227
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,830
Hello?

228
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,350
Hello?

229
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,970
Hey. Do you want breakfast?

230
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,490
No, thanks.

231
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,170
So how'd you pay for that stuff?

232
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:11,171
You and dad are still running
credit-card scams?

233
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,490
Yeah, well, hunting ain't
exactly a pro-ball career.

234
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:16,950
Besides, all we do is apply.

235
00:17:16,951 --> 00:17:18,451
It's not our fault they send us the cards.

236
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,610
Yeah, and what names did you write
on the application this time?

237
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,790
Uh... Bert Aframian and his son, Hector.

238
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:28,091
Scored two cards out of the deal.

239
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,610
Sounds about right.

240
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,610
I swear, man,you got to update
your cassette-tape collection.

241
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,370
Why?

242
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,370
Well, for one...
They're cassette tapes.

243
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,330
And two...

244
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:40,330
Black Sabbath, Motorhead, Metallica?

245
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,290
It's the greatest hits of mullet rock.

246
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,730
House rules, Sammy...
driver picks the music,

247
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,290
shotgun shuts his cake hole.

248
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,570
Yo Sammy is a chubby 12-year-old.
It's Sam, ok?...

249
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,170
Sorry, I can't hear you.
The music's too loud.

250
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,290
Thank you.

251
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,250
All right. So there's no one matching dad
at the hospital or morgue.

252
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,490
So that's something, I guess.

253
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,690
Check it out.

254
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,330
Let's go.

255
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,930
Did you guys find anything?

256
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,530
No!
Nothing!

257
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,290
No sign of struggle, no footprints,
no fingerprints...

258
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,250
Spotless.
It's almost too clean.

259
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,610
So this kid, Troy...

260
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,530
- He's dating your daughter, isn't he?
- Ya.

261
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,570
How's Amy doing?

262
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,650
She's  been putting up missing
posters downtown.

263
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,330
You had another one like this last
month, didn't you?

264
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,610
And who are you?

265
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,490
Federal marshals.

266
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,010
You two are a little young for
marshals, aren't you?

267
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,810
Thanks, that's awfully kind of you.

268
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,170
You did have another one just
like this, correct?

269
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,050
Yeah, that's right,

270
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,450
about a mile up the road.
There have been others before that.

271
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:30,090
So this victim...
You knew him?

272
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,770
A town like this, everybody
knows everybody.

273
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,490
Any connection between the victims
besides that they're all men?

274
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,370
No. Not so far as we can tell.

275
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,730
So what's the theory?

276
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,130
Honestly, we don't know...

277
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,450
Serial murderer, kidnapping ring.

278
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,470
Well, that is exactly the kind of
crap police work...

279
00:19:44,471 --> 00:19:46,371
I'd expect out of you guys.

280
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,730
Thank you for your time.

281
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,890
Gentlemen.

282
00:19:59,010 --> 00:19:59,970
What was that for?

283
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,490
- Why do you have to step on my foot?
- Why do you have to talk to police like that?

284
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,010
Come on.
They don't really know what's going on.

285
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,250
We're all alone on this.

286
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,510
If we're gonna find dad...

287
00:20:07,311 --> 00:20:09,211
we've got to get to the bottom
of this thing ourselves.

288
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,090
Can I help you boys?

289
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,290
No, sir. We were just leaving.

290
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,530
Agent Mulder, agent Scully.

291
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,850
I'll bet you that's her.

292
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:27,970
Yeah.

293
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,530
- You must be Amy.
- Yeah.

294
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,530
Troy told us about you.
We're his uncles.

295
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:34,731
I'm Dean. This is Sammy.

296
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,290
He never mentioned you to me.

297
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,010
Well,  that's Troy, I guess.

298
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,690
We're not around much.
We're up in Modesto.

299
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,750
So we're looking for him, too...

300
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:43,451
and we're kind of asking around.

301
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,730
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

302
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,090
Do you mind if we ask you a
couple questions?

303
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,650
I was on the phone with Troy.
He was driving home.

304
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:56,330
He said he would call me right back,
and he never did.

305
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,770
He didn't say anything strange?
Or out of the ordinary?

306
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,650
No, nothing I can remember.

307
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,330
I like your necklace.

308
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,130
Troy gave it to me.

309
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,530
Mostly to scare my parents...
You know, the devil stuff.

310
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,010
Actually it means just the opposite.

311
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,650
A pentagram is a protection against evil.

312
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,650
Really powerful,
I mean if you believe in that kind of thing.

313
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,010
Ok, thank you, Unsolved Mysteries.

314
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,410
Here's the deal, ladies...

315
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,770
The way Troy disappeared...
Something's not right.

316
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,810
So if you've heard anything...

317
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:34,850
What is it?

318
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,410
Well, it's just...

319
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,330
I mean, with all these guys
going missing, people talk.

320
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,490
What do they talk about?

321
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,130
It's kind of this local legend.

322
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,550
This one girl, she got murdered out...

323
00:21:48,251 --> 00:21:50,851
on Centennial like decades ago.

324
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,970
Well, supposedly, she's still out there.

325
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,570
She hitchhikes, and whoever picks her up...

326
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,650
Well, they disappear forever.

327
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,810
- Let me try.
- I got it.

328
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,890
Dude.

329
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,450
You're such a control freak.

330
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,210
So angry spirits are born out
of violent death, right?

331
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:28,011
Yeah.

332
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,730
Maybe it's not murder.

333
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,170
This was 1981.

334
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:41,271
Constance Welch, 24 years old...

335
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:43,370
jumps off Sylvania Bridge,
drowns in the river.

336
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,090
- Does it say why she did it?
- Yeah.

337
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:45,970
What?

338
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,930
An hour before they found her, she calls 911.

339
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,510
Her two little kids are in the bathtub.

340
00:22:50,511 --> 00:22:52,011
She leaves them alone for a minute...

341
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,130
and when she comes back...

342
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,410
they aren't breathing.

343
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,050
Both died.

344
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,490
"Our babies were gone,
and Constance just couldn't bear it,"

345
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,450
said husband, Joseph Welch.

346
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,730
That bridge look familiar to you?

347
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,410
So this is where Constance took the swan dive.

348
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,450
So you think dad would have been here?

349
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,810
Well, he's chasing the same story,
and we're chasing him.

350
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,450
Okay, so now what?

351
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,850
Now we keep digging till we find him.
It might take a while.

352
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,530
- Dean, I told you I've got to get back by...
- Monday.

353
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,330
Right.
The interview.

354
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,850
Yeah.
Yeah, I forgot.

355
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,290
You're really serious about this, aren't you?

356
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,330
You think you're just gonna
become some lawyer...

357
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,930
marry your girl?

358
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,050
Maybe.
Why not?

359
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,890
Does Jessica know the truth about you?

360
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:43,491
Does she know about the things you've done?

361
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,410
No, and she's not ever going to know.

362
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,530
Well, that's healthy.

363
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,570
You can pretend all you want,
Sammy, but sooner or later...

364
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:52,171
you're gonna have to face
up to who you really are.

365
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,290
Who is that?

366
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,730
- One of us.
- No!

367
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,290
I'm not like you. This is not going to be my life.

368
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:00,250
- Well, you have a responsibility.
- To dad?

369
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,250
And his crusade?

370
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,530
If it weren't for pictures,
I wouldn't even know what mom looks like.

371
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,250
What difference would it make?

372
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,530
Even if we do find the thing that killed her...

373
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,970
mom's gone, and she isn't coming back.

374
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,210
Don't talk about her like that.

375
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,930
Sam.

376
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,970
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

377
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,610
- What the...?
- Who's driving your car?

378
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,730
Come on, Dean.
Let's go! Go!

379
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,460
Dean!

380
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,460
Dean!

381
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:31,980
What?!

382
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,700
Hey, are you all right?

383
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,700
I'm super.

384
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,460
Car all right?

385
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,140
Yeah, whatever she did to it,
it seems all right now.

386
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,420
That Constance chick...
What a bitch!

387
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,300
Well, she doesn't want us digging around,
that's for sure.

388
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,380
So where's the trail go from here, genius?

389
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,140
You smell like a toilet.

390
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,220
One room, please.

391
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,740
You guys having a reunion or something?

392
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,660
What do you mean?

393
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,220
That  other guy, Bert Aframian.

394
00:26:18,221 --> 00:26:20,221
He came in and bought out
a room for the whole month.

395
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,100
I don't think he's been here
for a couple days at least.

396
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,700
Salt, cat's-eye shells...

397
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,740
He was worried,
trying to keep something from coming in.

398
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,700
What do you got here?

399
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,620
Centennial Highway victims.

400
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,420
I don't get it.

401
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,700
I mean, different men, different
jobs, age, ethnicities.

402
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,060
There's always a connection, right?

403
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,220
What do these guys have in common?

404
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,020
Dad figured it out.

405
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,460
What do you mean?

406
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,500
He found the same article we did.

407
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,780
Constance Welch.
She's a woman in white.

408
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,060
You sly dogs.

409
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,680
All right, so if we're dealing
with a woman in white...

410
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:49,581
dad would have found the
corpse and destroyed it.

411
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,300
She might have another weakness.

412
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,220
No, dad would want to make sure.
He'd dig her up.

413
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,580
Does it say where she's buried?

414
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,700
No, not that I can tell.

415
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,340
If I were dad, though,
I'd go ask her husband...

416
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,940
if he's still alive.

417
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,920
All right, why don't you see
if you can find an address?

418
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,221
I'm gonna get cleaned up.

419
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,940
Hey, Dean, what I said earlier
about mom and dad...

420
00:28:14,941 --> 00:28:16,341
I'm sorry.

421
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,500
No chick-flick moments.

422
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,380
All right... jerk.

423
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,300
Bitch.

424
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,220
"Hey, it's me.
It's about 10:20..."

425
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,940
Hey, man. I'm starving. I'm gonna grab a little...

426
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:47,741
something to eat
at that diner down the street.

427
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,980
You want anything?

428
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:49,820
No.

429
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,060
Aframian's buying.

430
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,300
"So come home soon, okay?
I love you."

431
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,540
What?

432
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,060
Dude, five-O.
Take off.

433
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,460
What about you?

434
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,220
Uh, they kind of spotted me.
Go find dad.

435
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,260
Problem, officers?

436
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,620
Where's your partner?

437
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,820
Partner? What?
What partner?

438
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,380
So fake U.S. Marshal, fake credit cards.

439
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,060
You got anything that's real?

440
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,460
My boobs.

441
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,340
You have the right to remain silent.

442
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,380
So you want to give us your real name?

443
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,820
I told you.
It's Nugent, Ted Nugent.

444
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,120
I'm not sure you realize just how
much trouble you're in here.

445
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,180
We're talking, like,
misdemeanor kind of trouble...

446
00:30:01,281 --> 00:30:02,981
or "squeal like a pig" trouble?

447
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,980
You got the faces of 10 missing
persons taped to your wall...

448
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,140
along with a whole lot
of satanic mumbo jumbo.

449
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,380
Boy, you are officially a suspect.

450
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,240
That makes sense because
when the first one...

451
00:30:13,241 --> 00:30:15,341
went missing in '82, I was 3.

452
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,660
I know you got partners.
One of them's an older guy.

453
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,300
Maybe he started the whole thing.

454
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,020
So tell me, Dean...

455
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,220
is this his?

456
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,900
I thought that might be your name.

457
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,940
See, I leafed through this,

458
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,620
what little I could make out.

459
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:43,421
I mean, it's nine kinds of crazy...

460
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,580
but I found this, too.

461
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,760
Now, you're staying right here...

462
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:53,061
till you tell me exactly
what the hell that means.

463
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,860
- Hi, uh, are you Joseph Welch?
- Yeah.

464
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,380
Yeah, he was older, but that's him.

465
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,700
He came by three or four days ago,
said he was a reporter.

466
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,420
That's right.
We're working on a story together.

467
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,260
Well, I don't know...

468
00:31:18,261 --> 00:31:20,761
what the hell kind of
story you're working on...

469
00:31:20,762 --> 00:31:21,462
the questions he asked me.

470
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,300
About your late wife, Constance.

471
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,900
He asked me where she was buried.

472
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,260
And where is that again?

473
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,300
What?
I got to go through these twice?

474
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,820
It's fact checking, if you don't mind.

475
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,620
In a plot behind my old place
over on Breckenridge.

476
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,700
Why did you move?

477
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,380
I'm not gonna live in the house
where my children died.

478
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,940
Mr. Welch, did you ever marry again?

479
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,540
No way.
Constance... She was the love of my life...

480
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,820
prettiest woman I ever known.

481
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,420
So you had a happy marriage?

482
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,580
Definitely.

483
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,140
Well, that should do it.
Thanks for your time.

484
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,020
Mr. Welch, you ever hear
of a woman in white?

485
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:21,900
A what?

486
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,340
A woman in white or
sometimes a weeping woman.

487
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,300
It's a ghost story.

488
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,660
Well, it's more of a phenomenon, really.

489
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,300
They're spirits. They've been
sighted for hundreds of years...

490
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,660
dozens of places in Hawaii and Mexico,
lately in Arizona, Indiana.

491
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,500
All these are different women,
you understand...

492
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,580
but all share the same story.

493
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,540
Boy, I don't care much for nonsense.

494
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,980
You see, when they were alive,

495
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,340
their husbands were unfaithful to them...

496
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,260
and these women...

497
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,340
basically suffering from temporary insanity...

498
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:55,541
murdered their children.

499
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,780
Then, once they realized
what they had done...

500
00:32:58,781 --> 00:33:00,381
they took their own lives.

501
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,340
So now their spirits are cursed...

502
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,580
walking back roads, waterways...

503
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,860
and if they find an unfaithful man,
they kill him...

504
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,940
and that man is never seen again.

505
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,900
You think...

506
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,540
You think that has something
to do with Constance...

507
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,300
you smart ass?

508
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,940
You tell me.

509
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:28,540
I mean, maybe...
Maybe I made some mistakes...

510
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,700
but no matter what I did...

511
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,980
Constance never would have
killed her own children.

512
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,340
Now, you get the hell out of here...

513
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,300
and you don't come back.

514
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,060
I don't know how many
times I got to tell you.

515
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,820
It's my high-school locker combo.

516
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,860
Are we gonna do this all night long?

517
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,860
We just got a 911.
Shots fired over at Whiteford Road.

518
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,220
Do you have to go to the bathroom?

519
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,420
No.

520
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,740
Good.

521
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,780
Fake 911 phone call, Sammy?
That's pretty illegal.

522
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,780
You're welcome.

523
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,100
Listen, we got to talk

524
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,820
Tell me about it.
So the husband was unfaithful.

525
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,500
We are dealing with a woman in white.

526
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,060
She's buried behind her old house.

527
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,220
Sammy, would you shut up for a second?

528
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,300
I can't figure out why he
hasn't destroyed the corpse yet.

529
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,860
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
He's gone.

530
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,260
Dad left Jericho.

531
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,100
What?
How do you know?

532
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,660
I've got his journal.

533
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,380
He doesn't go anywhere
without that thing.

534
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,580
Well, he did this time.

535
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,380
What's it say?

536
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,680
Same old ex-Marine crap...

537
00:35:24,681 --> 00:35:26,381
when he wants to let us know where he's going.

538
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,220
Coordinates.

539
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,180
Where to?

540
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,300
I'm not sure yet.

541
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,360
I don't understand.
I mean, what can be so important

542
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,820
that he just gets out in the
middle of the job?

543
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,540
Dean, what the hell is going on?

544
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,220
Sam, Sam!

545
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,700
Take me home.

546
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,300
Take me home.

547
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,820
No.

548
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,180
Don't do this.

549
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,220
I can never go home.

550
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,860
You're scared to go home.

551
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,660
Hold me.

552
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,020
I'm so cold.

553
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,260
You can't kill me.
I'm not unfaithful.

554
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,220
I've never been.

555
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,380
You will be.

556
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,460
I'm taking you home.

557
00:37:09,981 --> 00:37:11,081
Just hold me.

558
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,380
Sam!

559
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,700
- Sam!
- Here!

560
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,860
You okay?

561
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,340
I think.

562
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,940
- Can you move?
- Yeah. Help me.

563
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,900
You've come home to us, mommy.

564
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,340
So this is where she drowned her kids.

565
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,340
That's why she could never go home.

566
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,740
She was too scared to face them.

567
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,500
You found her weak spot.

568
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,180
Nice work, Sammy.

569
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,700
I wish I could say the same for you.

570
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,020
What were you thinking
shooting Casper in the face, you freak?

571
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,540
Hey, saved your ass.

572
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,860
I'll tell you another thing.

573
00:40:13,861 --> 00:40:15,261
If you screwed up my car...

574
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,940
I'll kill you.

575
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,300
Okay, here's where dad went.

576
00:40:31,301 --> 00:40:33,101
It's called Blackwater Ridge, Colorado.

577
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,980
Sounds charming.
How far?

578
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,660
About 600 miles.

579
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,580
If we shag ass,
we can make it by morning.

580
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,900
Dean, um...

581
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,380
You're not going.

582
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,820
The interview's in 10 hours.
I got to be there.

583
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,380
Yeah. Yeah, whatever.
I'll take you home.

584
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,580
You'll call me if you find him?

585
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,140
Maybe I can meet up with you later, huh?

586
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,220
Yeah, all right.

587
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,820
Sam.

588
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,380
You know, we made a hell of a team back there.

589
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,140
Yeah.

590
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,460
Jess!

591
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,340
You home!?

592
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,660
No!

593
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,420
Sam!

594
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,180
Jess!

595
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,300
Sam! Sam!

596
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,220
No! No!

597
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,740
Jess!
Jess! No!

598
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,540
We got work to do.
