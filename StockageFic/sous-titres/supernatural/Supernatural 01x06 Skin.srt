1
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,670
Freeze!

2
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:51,850
Don't move!

3
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:52,660
Drop the knife.

4
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,239
Keep your hands where I can see them!

5
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:55,109
Drop it!

6
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:58,249
In a gadda da vida, baby

7
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:02,588
don't you know that I'll always be true?

8
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:22,456
All right.

9
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:25,295
I figure we'd hit tucumcari by lunch,
then head south,

10
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,575
hit bisbee by midnight.

11
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:31,414
Sam wears women's underwear.

12
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:33,714
I've been listening. I'm just busy.
- Busy doing what?

13
00:02:34,094 --> 00:02:35,304
Reading e-mails.

14
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:38,674
E- mails from who?

15
00:02:38,803 --> 00:02:40,503
From my friends at Stanford.

16
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:42,663
You're kidding.
You still keep in touch with your college buddies?

17
00:02:43,953 --> 00:02:44,673
Why not?

18
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:45,873
Well...

19
00:02:49,442 --> 00:02:51,232
What exactly do you tell them,

20
00:02:51,702 --> 00:02:54,601
You know, about where you've been,
what you've been doing?

21
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,691
I tell them I'm on a road trip with my big brother.

22
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:58,901
I tell them I needed some time off, after Jess.

23
00:02:59,361 --> 00:03:00,651
Well, so you lie to them.

24
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:01,680
No.

25
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,290
I just don't tell them

26
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,470
everything.

27
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,460
Yeah. That's called lying.

28
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,669
Hey, man, I get it.
Telling them the truth is far worse.

29
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:11,779
So what am I supposed to do,
just cut everybody out of my life?

30
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:15,359
You're serious?
- Look, it sucks.

31
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:18,568
But in a job like this,
you can't get close to people.

32
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:20,418
You're kind of antisocial.
You know that?

33
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:21,888
Yeah. Whatever.

34
00:03:25,697 --> 00:03:27,237
God.
- What?

35
00:03:29,197 --> 00:03:32,546
This e-mail from this girl, Rebecca Warren,
one of those friends of mine.

36
00:03:32,596 --> 00:03:33,326
Is she hot?

37
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:36,806
I went to school with her and her brother Zach.

38
00:03:36,856 --> 00:03:38,785
She says Zach's been charged with murder.

39
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:42,745
He's been arrested for killing his girlfriend.
Rebecca says he didn't do it,

40
00:03:42,795 --> 00:03:46,004
but it sounds like the cops have a pretty good case.

41
00:03:46,254 --> 00:03:48,544
Dude, what kind of people you hanging out with?

42
00:03:48,654 --> 00:03:51,014
No, man. I know Zach.
He's no killer.

43
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,244
Well, maybe you know Zach as well as he knows you.

44
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:55,373
They're in St. Louis.
We're going.

45
00:03:56,693 --> 00:03:58,493
I'm sorry about your buddy, okay?

46
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:01,742
But this does not sound like our kind of problem.
- It is our problem.

47
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,852
They're my friends.
- St. Louis is 400 miles behind us, Sam.

48
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,689
Oh, my god. Sam.
- Well, if it isn't little Becky.

49
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,629
You know what you can do with that "little Becky" crap.

50
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:30,499
I got your e-mail.

51
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:32,348
I didn't think that you would come here.

52
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:35,248
Dean, older brother.
- Hi.

53
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:36,078
Hi.

54
00:04:36,488 --> 00:04:37,668
We're here to help.

55
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:38,997
Whatever we can do.

56
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:40,547
Come in.

57
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:46,686
Nice place.

58
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:47,786
It's my parents'.

59
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:50,776
I was just crashing here for the long weekend
when everything happened.

60
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,816
I decided to take the semester off.

61
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,295
I'm gonna stay until Zach's free.

62
00:04:55,745 --> 00:04:56,535
Where are your folks?

63
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:58,595
They live in Paris for half the year,

64
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:00,595
so they're on their way home now for the trial.

65
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:02,584
Do you guys want a beer or something?

66
00:05:02,614 --> 00:05:03,764
Hey.
- No, thanks.

67
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:06,224
So...

68
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:07,634
tell us what happened.

69
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:13,673
Well, um, Zach had came home,
and he found Emily tied to a chair.

70
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,972
And she was beaten up and bloody, and she wasn't breathing.

71
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:20,162
And so he...he called 911.

72
00:05:20,372 --> 00:05:22,142
And the police, they showed up, and...

73
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:24,261
and they arrested him.

74
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:25,641
But the thing is,

75
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:28,251
the only way that Zach could have killed Emily

76
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:30,630
is if he was in two places at the same time.

77
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,910
The police, they have a video.

78
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,770
It's from the security tape from across the street.

79
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,929
And it shows Zach coming home at 10:30.

80
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:42,879
Now, Emily was killed just after that,

81
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:48,008
but I swear he was here with me,
having a few beers until at least after midnight.

82
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:50,128
You know, maybe we could see the crime scene,

83
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:51,338
Zach's house.

84
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:52,088
We could?

85
00:05:53,477 --> 00:05:56,997
Why?What could you do?
- Well, me, not much.

86
00:05:57,047 --> 00:05:59,007
But Dean's a cop.

87
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:03,926
A detective, actually.

88
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:05,536
Really? Where?

89
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:07,506
Bisbee, Arizona.

90
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:10,645
But I'm off duty now.

91
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:16,244
You guys, it's so nice to offer, but I just...
I don't know.

92
00:06:16,984 --> 00:06:17,954
Beck,

93
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:18,914
Look.

94
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:20,564
I know Zach didn't do this.

95
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:24,773
Now, we have to find a way to prove that he's innocent.

96
00:06:26,943 --> 00:06:27,903
Okay.

97
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:30,742
I'm gonna go get the keys.

98
00:06:37,182 --> 00:06:39,761
Oh, yeah, man.
You're a real straight shooter with your friends.

99
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:40,411
Look,

100
00:06:41,171 --> 00:06:43,951
Zach and Becky need our help.
- I just don't think this is our kind of problem.

101
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:45,011
Two places at once?

102
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,660
We've looked into less.

103
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:07,468
You're sure this is okay?

104
00:07:07,558 --> 00:07:08,267
Yeah.

105
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:09,997
I am an officer of the law.

106
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:29,105
Beck, you wanna wait outside?

107
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:31,954
No. I wanna help.

108
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:42,483
Tell us what else the police said.

109
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:43,633
Well...

110
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:46,422
there was no sign of a break-in.

111
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:48,422
They say that Emily let her attacker in.

112
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:51,132
And the lawyers are already talking about a plea bargaining.

113
00:07:57,221 --> 00:07:58,351
Look, Beck...

114
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:00,290
if Zach didn't do this,

115
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,310
it means someone else did.

116
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,660
Any idea who?

117
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:10,229
Um, there was something.

118
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:13,279
About a week before, somebody broke in here

119
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,068
and stole some clothes

120
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,908
Zach's clothes.

121
00:08:17,068 --> 00:08:19,258
And the police,they don't think it's anything.

122
00:08:19,738 --> 00:08:22,567
I mean, we're not that far from downtown.

123
00:08:23,097 --> 00:08:25,077
I mean, sometimes people get robbed.

124
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:35,516
You know, that used to be the sweetest dog.

125
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:36,746
What happened?

126
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:38,085
He just changed.

127
00:08:38,155 --> 00:08:39,805
Do you remember when he changed?

128
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:41,675
I guess around the time of the murder.

129
00:08:53,103 --> 00:08:57,053
So the neighbor's dog went psycho
right around the time Zach's girlfriend was killed.

130
00:08:58,053 --> 00:09:00,582
Animals can have a sharp sense of the paranormal.

131
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:02,542
Maybe Fido saw something.

132
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:06,812
So you think maybe this is our kind of problem?

133
00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:07,881
No. Probably not.

134
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:10,491
But we should look at the security tape just to make sure.

135
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:11,841
Yeah.
- Yeah.

136
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:16,740
So the tape, the security footage?

137
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,790
Think maybe your lawyers could get their hands on it?

138
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,420
I just don't have that kind of jurisdiction.

139
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,210
I've already got it.

140
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,299
I didn't want to say something in front of the cop.

141
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:25,109
I, um,

142
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:26,839
I stole it off the lawyer's desk.

143
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,729
I just had to see it for myself.

144
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:31,138
All right.

145
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:53,915
Why do they always have to send you?

146
00:09:53,985 --> 00:09:55,575
Because I'm the best.

147
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:58,025
I know.
That's why I want you to stay home.

148
00:09:58,345 --> 00:10:00,734
It's just Kansas city.

149
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:03,444
I'll be home tomorrow night

150
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:04,804
and make it up to you.

151
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,820
Here he comes.

152
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,239
22:04 That's just after 10:00.

153
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:41,279
You said time of death was about 10:30.

154
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:44,698
Our lawyers hired some kind of video expert.

155
00:10:44,788 --> 00:10:46,438
He says the tape's authentic.

156
00:10:46,668 --> 00:10:48,178
It wasn't tampered with.

157
00:10:52,227 --> 00:10:55,237
Hey, Beck, can we take those beers now?

158
00:10:55,407 --> 00:10:56,627
Oh, sure.

159
00:10:58,027 --> 00:10:59,416
Hey, uh...

160
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,406
maybe some sandwiches, too?

161
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:03,096
What do you think this is, hooters?

162
00:11:05,126 --> 00:11:06,186
I wish.

163
00:11:06,786 --> 00:11:07,675
What is it?

164
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:08,805
Check this out.

165
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:17,834
Maybe it's just a camera flare.

166
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:20,044
That's not like any camera flare I've ever seen.

167
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:23,263
A lot of cultures believe that a photograph can catch
a glimpse of the soul.

168
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:25,033
Right.
- Remember that dog that was freaking out?

169
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:26,163
Maybe he saw this thing.

170
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:28,703
Maybe this is some kind of dark double of Zach's

171
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:30,262
something that looks like him but isn't him.

172
00:11:30,282 --> 00:11:31,062
Like a doppelganger.

173
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:33,702
That would sure explain how he was two places at once.

174
00:11:43,251 --> 00:11:44,850
Honey, it's me.

175
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,130
Client canceled at the last minute.

176
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:53,659
I called.

177
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:54,729
Why didn't you answer?

178
00:11:58,719 --> 00:11:59,708
Lindsay?

179
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:03,778
Lindsay?

180
00:12:07,387 --> 00:12:08,427
Lindsay?!

181
00:12:11,547 --> 00:12:12,287
Oh.

182
00:12:13,837 --> 00:12:15,456
It's okay, Lindsay. It's me.

183
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,626
Please, don't hurt me any more.

184
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,576
Leave me alone.

185
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:18,028
All right.

186
00:13:18,138 --> 00:13:20,188
What are we doing here at 5:30 in the morning?

187
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:21,128
I realized something.

188
00:13:21,587 --> 00:13:24,507
The videotape shows the killer going in but not coming out.

189
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:26,537
So he came out the back door?

190
00:13:26,697 --> 00:13:27,347
Right,

191
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:29,076
so there should be a trail to follow,

192
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:30,846
a trail the police would never pursue.

193
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:33,086
'Cause they think the killer never left.

194
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:34,586
They caught your friend Zach inside.

195
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:37,645
Still don't know what we're doing here at 5:30 in the morning.

196
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:52,353
Blood.

197
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,423
Somebody came this way.

198
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:57,253
Maybe the trail ends. I don't see anything over here.

199
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,820
What happened?

200
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,550
He tried to kill his wife.

201
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,280
Tied her up and beat her.

202
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,090
Really?

203
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,859
I used to see him going to work in the morning.
He'd wave, say hello.

204
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:26,409
He seemed like such a nice guy.

205
00:14:51,585 --> 00:14:52,125
Hey.

206
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,695
Remember when I said this wasn't our kind of problem?

207
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:56,245
Yeah.
- Definitely our kind of problem.

208
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:57,065
What did you find out?

209
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:59,054
I talked to the patrolman who was first on the scene.

210
00:14:59,084 --> 00:15:00,254
He heard this guy Alex's story.

211
00:15:00,454 --> 00:15:03,894
Apparently the dude was driving home from a
business trip when his wife was attacked.

212
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:05,104
So he was two places at once.

213
00:15:05,144 --> 00:15:05,544
Exactly.

214
00:15:05,684 --> 00:15:07,033
Then he sees himself in the house.

215
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:08,233
Police think he's a nut job.

216
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:12,383
Two dark doubles attacking loved ones in exactly the same way.

217
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:15,432
Could be the same thing doing it, too.

218
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:17,902
Shapeshifter?

219
00:15:18,072 --> 00:15:20,032
Something that can make itself look like anyone?

220
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:21,921
Every culture in the world has a shapeshifter lore;

221
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:24,831
legends of creatures who can transform themselves

222
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,291
into animals or other men.
- Right, skinwalkers, werewolves.

223
00:15:27,311 --> 00:15:29,180
We've got two attacks within blocks of each other.

224
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,010
I'm guessing we got a shapeshifter
problem in the neighborhood.

225
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,450
Let me ask you this.

226
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,460
In all this shapeshifter lore,

227
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,799
can any of them fly?

228
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,649
Not that I know of.
- I picked up a trail here.

229
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:43,718
Someone ran out of the back of this building,
headed off this way.

230
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:44,848
Just like your friend's house.

231
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:45,648
Yeah.

232
00:15:45,688 --> 00:15:47,018
And just like at Zach's house,

233
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:49,228
the trail suddenly ends.

234
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:51,257
Whatever it is just

235
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,727
disappeared.

236
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:56,267
Well, there's another way to go.

237
00:15:57,647 --> 00:15:58,177
Down.

238
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:19,964
I bet this runs right by Zach's house, too.

239
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:23,313
The shapeshifter could be using the sewer system to get around.

240
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:25,333
I think you're right.

241
00:16:26,743 --> 00:16:27,903
Look at this.

242
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:33,292
Oh.

243
00:16:34,522 --> 00:16:36,841
Is this from his victims?

244
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:44,270
You know, I just had a sick thought.

245
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,200
When the shapeshifter changes shape,

246
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,860
maybe it sheds.

247
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,639
That is sick.

248
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:55,249
Well, one thing I learned from dad

249
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,499
no matter what kind of shapeshifter it is,

250
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,538
there's one sure way to kill it.

251
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:01,318
Silver bullet to the heart.

252
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:02,208
That's right.

253
00:17:05,438 --> 00:17:06,247
This is Sam.

254
00:17:06,537 --> 00:17:07,397
Where are you?

255
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:09,557
We're near Zach's.
We're just checking some things out.

256
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:12,547
Well look Sam, just stop, because I really don't need your help anymore.

257
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:13,436
What are you talking about?

258
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:15,796
I told the lawyers that we went to the crime scene.

259
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:17,766
Why would you do that?

260
00:17:17,856 --> 00:17:19,596
I told them that we were with a police officer.

261
00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:20,575
And they checked it out,

262
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:23,455
and they told me there is no detective Dean Winchester.

263
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:23,855
Beck

264
00:17:23,905 --> 00:17:26,505
I don't understand why you would lie to me about something like that.

265
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:28,304
We were trying to help.

266
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,394
Oh, trying to help?

267
00:17:29,684 --> 00:17:31,984
Do you realize that that was a sealed crime scene?

268
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:33,394
This could have just ruined Zach's case.

269
00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:35,553
Beck, I'm sorry, but...
- No. Goodbye, Sam.

270
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:51,131
I hate to say it, but that's exactly what I'm talking about.

271
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:55,231
You lie to your friends because if they knew the real you
they'd be freaked.

272
00:17:55,631 --> 00:17:57,041
It's just

273
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:59,660
It'd be easier if...
- If I was like you.

274
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,620
Hey, man, like it or not, we are not like other people.

275
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,650
But I'll tell you one thing.

276
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,819
This whole gig...

277
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,569
..it ain't without perks.

278
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:05,271
I think we're close to its lair.

279
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:06,341
Why do you say that?

280
00:19:06,431 --> 00:19:09,011
'Cause there's another puke-inducing pile next to your face.

281
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,631
Oh, God.

282
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,990
It looks like it's lived here for awhile.

283
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,690
Who knows how many murders he's gotten away with?

284
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,620
Dean!

285
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:27,039
Get this son of a bitch!

286
00:19:56,815 --> 00:19:58,314
All right. Let's split up.

287
00:19:58,414 --> 00:20:00,194
All right. I'll meet you around the other side.

288
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:37,179
Hey.

289
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,069
Anything?

290
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:42,728
No. He's gone.

291
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,588
All right. Let's get back to the car.

292
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:02,066
You think he found another way underground?

293
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:03,486
Probably.

294
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:04,915
You got the keys?

295
00:21:08,755 --> 00:21:13,064
Hey, didn't dad once face a shapeshifter in San Antonio?

296
00:21:13,414 --> 00:21:14,284
That was Austin.

297
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:17,954
And it turned out not to be a shapeshifter.
It was a thought-form

298
00:21:18,064 --> 00:21:19,494
a psychic projection. Remember?

299
00:21:21,483 --> 00:21:22,153
Oh. Right.

300
00:21:23,593 --> 00:21:24,483
Here you go.

301
00:21:40,771 --> 00:21:41,801
Don't move!

302
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,550
What have you done with him?

303
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,000
Dude, chill.

304
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,040
It's me, all right?
- No, I don't think so.

305
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,980
Where's my brother?
- You're about to shoot him.

306
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:50,579
Sam, calm down.

307
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,659
You caught those keys with your left.

308
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:53,179
Your shoulder was hurt.

309
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:54,079
Yeah. It's better.

310
00:21:54,219 --> 00:21:55,289
What do you want me to do, cry?

311
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:56,549
You're not my brother.

312
00:21:58,398 --> 00:22:00,638
Why don't you pull the trigger,then, hmm?

313
00:22:00,728 --> 00:22:01,688
Because you're not sure.

314
00:22:02,258 --> 00:22:03,458
Dude, you know me.

315
00:22:03,808 --> 00:22:04,417
Don't.

316
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,553
Where is he?

317
00:22:40,643 --> 00:22:41,852
Where's dean?

318
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:45,692
I wouldn't worry about him.

319
00:22:46,662 --> 00:22:48,122
I'd worry about you.

320
00:22:48,162 --> 00:22:49,281
Where is he?

321
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:52,471
You don't really wanna know.

322
00:22:55,021 --> 00:22:57,990
I swear, the more I learn about you and your family...

323
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,450
I thought I came from a bad back ground.

324
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,270
What do you mean, learn?

325
00:23:24,257 --> 00:23:25,827
He's sure got issues with you.

326
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,626
You got to go to college.

327
00:23:29,626 --> 00:23:30,786
He had to stay home.

328
00:23:32,826 --> 00:23:34,075
I mean I had to stay home

329
00:23:34,145 --> 00:23:35,145
with dad.

330
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:37,225
You don't think I had dreams of my own?

331
00:23:37,325 --> 00:23:38,895
But dad needed me.

332
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:40,595
Where the hell were you?

333
00:23:40,615 --> 00:23:42,394
Where is my brother?

334
00:23:42,424 --> 00:23:43,364
I'm your brother.

335
00:23:45,844 --> 00:23:46,784
See, deep down...

336
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:49,203
I'm just jealous.

337
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:52,183
You got friends.You could have a life.

338
00:23:54,243 --> 00:23:55,163
Me,

339
00:23:55,343 --> 00:23:56,992
I know I'm a freak.

340
00:23:57,292 --> 00:24:00,082
And sooner or later, everybody's gonna leave me.

341
00:24:02,522 --> 00:24:03,762
What are you talking about?

342
00:24:03,852 --> 00:24:04,601
You left.

343
00:24:05,741 --> 00:24:08,361
Hell, I did everything dad asked me to, and he ditched me, too.

344
00:24:08,671 --> 00:24:10,301
No explanation. Nothing. Just... poof.

345
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,990
Left me with your sorry ass.

346
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:21,269
But still, this life,

347
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:24,309
it's not without its perks.

348
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:27,608
I meet the nicest people.

349
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:30,028
Like little Becky.

350
00:24:30,448 --> 00:24:32,868
You know Dean would bang her if he had the chance.

351
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:35,817
Let's see what happens.

352
00:24:47,046 --> 00:24:48,676
Oh, hi.

353
00:24:48,785 --> 00:24:50,365
I know what you're gonna say.
- Oh, you do?

354
00:24:50,475 --> 00:24:51,935
Well, no. Not exactly.

355
00:24:51,995 --> 00:24:53,045
But I can take a guess.

356
00:24:53,965 --> 00:24:54,925
"Get off my porch."

357
00:24:56,734 --> 00:24:57,504
That's about right.

358
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:00,124
I admit it, we lied.

359
00:25:00,344 --> 00:25:01,994
Thought I'd try to explain myself.

360
00:25:02,404 --> 00:25:03,903
Sam told me not to come.
But

361
00:25:03,993 --> 00:25:06,103
I thought, "what the hell? I have to try."

362
00:25:12,382 --> 00:25:13,592
Damn it.

363
00:25:17,592 --> 00:25:21,091
That'd better be you, Sam, and not that freak of nature.

364
00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:22,941
Yeah, it's me.

365
00:25:23,081 --> 00:25:24,441
He went to Rebecca's,

366
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:25,831
looking like you.

367
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,640
Well, he's not stupid.

368
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,100
He picked the handsome one.

369
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,359
So you're saying that there's something out there
that made itself look like my brother?

370
00:25:40,449 --> 00:25:41,088
Mm-hmm.

371
00:25:42,298 --> 00:25:43,218
What'd you call it?

372
00:25:43,548 --> 00:25:44,498
- A shapeshifter.

373
00:25:46,048 --> 00:25:46,858
Yeah,

374
00:25:46,968 --> 00:25:48,208
maybe we're crazy.

375
00:25:48,977 --> 00:25:50,057
But what if we're not?

376
00:25:50,827 --> 00:25:53,837
I mean, look. You said it yourself.
Zach was in two places at once.

377
00:25:54,217 --> 00:25:55,287
Tell me how that could happen.

378
00:25:55,357 --> 00:25:56,106
Okay. So

379
00:25:56,396 --> 00:25:57,076
this thing,

380
00:25:57,366 --> 00:25:58,046
it

381
00:25:58,466 --> 00:26:00,306
it can make itself look like anybody?

382
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:01,436
That's right.

383
00:26:01,886 --> 00:26:04,835
Well, what is it, like a genetic freak?

384
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:08,185
Maybe.

385
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:12,694
Evolution is about mutation,

386
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:13,754
right?

387
00:26:15,044 --> 00:26:17,264
So maybe this thing was born human

388
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:19,523
but was different.

389
00:26:20,973 --> 00:26:21,663
Hideous

390
00:26:22,063 --> 00:26:23,003
and hated.

391
00:26:24,993 --> 00:26:27,022
Until he learned to become someone else.

392
00:26:32,302 --> 00:26:33,611
Yeah, that's the thing.

393
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:35,931
He didn't just look like you. He was you.

394
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:37,841
Or he was becoming you.

395
00:26:38,111 --> 00:26:38,861
What do you mean?

396
00:26:38,911 --> 00:26:41,950
I don't know. It's like he was downloading your thoughts and memories.

397
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,510
You mean like the vulcan mind-meld?

398
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,720
Yeah. Something like that.

399
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,960
I mean, maybe that's why he didn't just kill us.

400
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:54,369
Maybe, he needs to keep us alive

401
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:57,398
a psychic connection.
- Hands.

402
00:26:58,098 --> 00:26:58,878
Yeah.

403
00:26:59,098 --> 00:27:00,208
Come on. We got to go.

404
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:01,368
He's probably at Rebecca's already.

405
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,617
Come on. We got to find a phone, call the police.

406
00:27:06,747 --> 00:27:07,807
Whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa, whoa.

407
00:27:08,037 --> 00:27:09,727
You're gonna put an apb out on me.

408
00:27:10,377 --> 00:27:11,176
Sorry.

409
00:27:12,016 --> 00:27:12,736
This way.

410
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:19,475
It's funny.

411
00:27:20,795 --> 00:27:22,145
I kind of understand him.

412
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,615
He's all alone.

413
00:27:25,285 --> 00:27:26,424
Close to no one.

414
00:27:27,264 --> 00:27:29,394
All he wants is for someone to love him.

415
00:27:32,774 --> 00:27:33,963
He's like me.

416
00:27:39,503 --> 00:27:41,122
Everybody needs

417
00:27:41,232 --> 00:27:44,072
a little human touch now and then.

418
00:27:45,242 --> 00:27:46,882
It's so hard to be different.

419
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:48,281
You should go.

420
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,180
You are disgusting! Just get the hell out of here!

421
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,090
Rebecca, just calm down.
- Oh, calm down?

422
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,389
What is wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

423
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:06,539
What's wrong with you?!
- I'm calling the police.

424
00:28:19,427 --> 00:28:20,677
Give me your hands.

425
00:28:21,897 --> 00:28:22,727
Shut up!

426
00:28:27,656 --> 00:28:29,146
You're a nice girl, Rebecca.

427
00:28:30,386 --> 00:28:31,676
I mean, I liked you.

428
00:28:33,815 --> 00:28:34,655
Believe me,

429
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:36,145
it makes it harder.

430
00:28:39,915 --> 00:28:41,574
But I got to do what I got to do.

431
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,880
I wish I would've met you

432
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:20,149
now it's a little late

433
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:23,579
Freeze!

434
00:29:25,248 --> 00:29:26,378
Drop the knife.

435
00:29:26,638 --> 00:29:27,948
Drop the knife!

436
00:29:32,368 --> 00:29:32,957
Come on! Come on!

437
00:29:33,487 --> 00:29:39,747
They think that your early ending was all wrong

438
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:49,875
for the most part, they're right but look how they all got strong.

439
00:29:52,715 --> 00:29:55,464
That's why I say, hey, man, nice shot..

440
00:29:58,904 --> 00:30:00,804
Good shot, man

441
00:30:02,763 --> 00:30:06,763
That's why I say, hey, man, nice shot

442
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:10,812
Good shot, man

443
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:45,768
An anonymous tip led police to a home in the central west end,

444
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:49,087
where a S.W.A.T. Team discovered a local woman bound and gagged.

445
00:30:49,187 --> 00:30:53,067
Her attacker, a white male approximately 24 to 30 years of age,

446
00:30:53,137 --> 00:30:54,897
was discovered hiding in the home.

447
00:30:55,076 --> 00:30:56,406
Shots were fired.

448
00:30:56,616 --> 00:30:58,296
It's not even a good picture.

449
00:30:58,326 --> 00:31:00,236
It's good enough.

450
00:31:06,695 --> 00:31:08,855
Aw, come on!

451
00:31:11,614 --> 00:31:14,074
They said attempted murder. At least we know...
- I didn't kill her.

452
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,454
I'll check with Rebecca in the morning to see if she's all right.

453
00:31:16,504 --> 00:31:19,443
First I want to find that handsome devil and kick the holy crap out of him.

454
00:31:19,623 --> 00:31:20,443
We have no weapons.

455
00:31:20,533 --> 00:31:21,343
No silver bullets.

456
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:22,753
The guy's walking around with my face.

457
00:31:23,183 --> 00:31:24,733
It's a little personal. I want to find him.

458
00:31:26,002 --> 00:31:26,512
Okay.

459
00:31:27,392 --> 00:31:27,972
Where do we look?

460
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,172
We could start with the sewers.

461
00:31:29,272 --> 00:31:30,612
We have no weapons.

462
00:31:30,772 --> 00:31:32,581
He stole our guns. We need more.

463
00:31:35,221 --> 00:31:35,981
The car?

464
00:31:36,331 --> 00:31:37,691
I'm betting he drove over to Rebecca's.

465
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:39,960
The news said he fled on foot. I bet it's still parked there.

466
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,610
Oh, the thought of him driving my car.
- Aw, come on.

467
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,060
It's killing me.
- Let it go.

468
00:31:57,078 --> 00:31:58,008
There she is.

469
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:00,928
Finally, something went right tonight.

470
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:12,766
This way.This way!

471
00:32:13,396 --> 00:32:14,416
You go. I'll hold them off.

472
00:32:14,776 --> 00:32:15,766
What are you talking about!
They'll catch you.

473
00:32:15,836 --> 00:32:17,865
They can't hold me! Just go. Keep out of sight.

474
00:32:17,925 --> 00:32:18,775
Meet me at Rebecca's.

475
00:32:19,755 --> 00:32:21,995
Dean, stay out of the sewers alone!

476
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:23,855
I mean it!

477
00:32:24,604 --> 00:32:25,424
Don't move.

478
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:27,604
Keep your hands so I can see them.

479
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:37,273
I'm sorry, Sam.

480
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:38,873
You know me.

481
00:32:39,483 --> 00:32:40,412
I just can't wait.

482
00:33:17,337 --> 00:33:20,117
So say this shapeshifter is real.

483
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:21,957
By the way, you know,you're crazy.

484
00:33:22,997 --> 00:33:24,107
But, um,

485
00:33:24,197 --> 00:33:25,186
say it is real.

486
00:33:26,146 --> 00:33:27,126
How do you stop it?

487
00:33:27,886 --> 00:33:28,596
Thanks.

488
00:33:29,616 --> 00:33:31,486
Silver bullet to the heart.

489
00:33:33,115 --> 00:33:34,125
You are crazy.

490
00:33:37,435 --> 00:33:38,475
What happened?

491
00:33:39,374 --> 00:33:42,564
I- I was walking home, and everything just went white.

492
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:47,123
Someone hit me over the head,
and I wound up here just in time to see that thing turn into me.

493
00:33:47,223 --> 00:33:50,133
I don't know. How is that even possible?
- Okay. Okay.It's okay.

494
00:33:50,443 --> 00:33:51,963
Come on. Can you walk?

495
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:53,253
Okay. We got to hurry.

496
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:54,322
Sam went to see you.

497
00:34:03,201 --> 00:34:04,741
What are you gonna do to me?

498
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,921
I'm not gonna do anything.

499
00:34:07,571 --> 00:34:08,521
Dean will, though.

500
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,330
They'll never catch him.

501
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,100
Oh, doesn't matter.

502
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,179
Murder in the first of his own brother.

503
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:19,539
He'll be hunted the rest of his life.

504
00:34:25,308 --> 00:34:26,728
I must say.

505
00:34:27,488 --> 00:34:29,618
I will be sorry to lose this skin.

506
00:34:29,978 --> 00:34:31,847
Your brother's got a lot of good qualities.

507
00:34:32,617 --> 00:34:34,647
You should appreciate him more than you do.

508
00:34:36,277 --> 00:34:37,567
Cheers.

509
00:35:14,062 --> 00:35:15,752
Not bad, little brother.

510
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:16,731
You're not him.

511
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:33,219
Even when we were kids,

512
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,459
I always kicked your ass.

513
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,424
Hey!

514
00:37:09,876 --> 00:37:11,166
So this is what you do?

515
00:37:11,506 --> 00:37:14,066
You and your brother, you hunt down these kinds of things?

516
00:37:15,086 --> 00:37:16,995
Yeah, pretty much.
- I can't believe it.

517
00:37:17,245 --> 00:37:18,775
I mean, I saw it with my own eyes, and...

518
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:22,015
Does everybody at school...

519
00:37:22,105 --> 00:37:23,614
Nobody knows that you do this?

520
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:24,974
No.

521
00:37:25,814 --> 00:37:26,744
Did Jessica know?

522
00:37:28,734 --> 00:37:29,914
No, she didn't.

523
00:37:32,313 --> 00:37:33,693
It must be lonely.

524
00:37:34,113 --> 00:37:34,823
Oh, no.

525
00:37:34,903 --> 00:37:35,863
No, it's not so bad.

526
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:39,452
Anyway, what can I do? It's my family.

527
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:44,222
Well, you know, Zach and me and everybody at school,
we really miss you.

528
00:37:45,752 --> 00:37:47,221
Yeah. Me too.

529
00:37:50,271 --> 00:37:53,021
Well, will you call sometime?

530
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,900
It might not before a little while.

531
00:38:11,858 --> 00:38:13,528
So what about your friend Zach?

532
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:17,917
The cops are blaming this Dean Winchester guy for Emily's murder.

533
00:38:18,237 --> 00:38:20,187
They found the murder weapon in the guy's lair,

534
00:38:20,407 --> 00:38:22,717
Zach's clothes stained with her blood.

535
00:38:22,937 --> 00:38:25,956
Now they're thinking maybe the surveillance tape was tampered with.

536
00:38:26,176 --> 00:38:28,486
Yeah, Becca says Zach will be released soon.

537
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,565
Oh, oh, oh

538
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:40,314
Sorry, man.

539
00:38:42,184 --> 00:38:43,114
About what?

540
00:38:45,144 --> 00:38:46,853
I really wish things could be different, you know?

541
00:38:46,913 --> 00:38:47,843
I wish you could just be

542
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:49,753
joe college.

543
00:38:49,793 --> 00:38:50,573
Aw, it's okay.

544
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:52,773
You know, truth is,

545
00:38:53,132 --> 00:38:55,532
even at Stanford, deep down, I never really fit in.

546
00:38:55,592 --> 00:38:57,022
Well, that's because you're a freak.

547
00:38:57,222 --> 00:38:58,092
Yeah. Thanks.

548
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,542
Well, I'm a freak, too.

549
00:39:00,252 --> 00:39:01,831
I'm right there with you all the way.

550
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:04,851
Yeah, I know you are.

551
00:39:06,681 --> 00:39:08,001
You know, I got to say,

552
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,930
I'm sorry I'm gonna miss it.
- Miss what?

553
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,180
How many chances am I gonna have to see my own funeral?
