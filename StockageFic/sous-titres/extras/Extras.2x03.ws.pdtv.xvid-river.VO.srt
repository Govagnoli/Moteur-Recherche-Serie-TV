1
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,881
Oh, I don't like the sound of that.

2
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:29,945
What's up with you?

3
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:33,730
There's a story here
about the Brazilian rowing team.

4
00:00:33,856 --> 00:00:36,943
They've been practicing on Amazon
and it's full of piranha fish,

5
00:00:36,978 --> 00:00:38,571
and they capsized.

6
00:00:38,669 --> 00:00:42,965
Says in paper they were in danger
of having their cocks eaten.

7
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:46,199
Why would piranhas go
for the cocks first?

8
00:00:47,985 --> 00:00:50,320
It doesn't mean
what you think it...

9
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:55,036
The cox is a little fella who sits
at back of boat shouting stroke.

10
00:00:55,713 --> 00:00:59,087
If I were a piranha,
I'd draw the line at eating cocks.

11
00:00:59,145 --> 00:01:00,592
It doesn't mean they...

12
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,880
- Oh, you don't get it, do you?
- I don't get it.

13
00:01:02,915 --> 00:01:05,168
I know you don't get it.

14
00:01:05,554 --> 00:01:08,052
Why, what would you go for first
if you were a piranha?

15
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:10,249
I'd probably just have
a bag of crisps.

16
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:13,564
Are you havin' a laugh?
Is he havin' a laugh?

17
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:15,805
He'd definitely be interested
in the film, yeah.

18
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,416
Who else is in it?

19
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,178
Fellow played who?

20
00:01:19,926 --> 00:01:21,465
Harry Potter?

21
00:01:21,757 --> 00:01:23,722
I've never heard of him. What...

22
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:27,660
Little magical kid with glasses?
You know Andy's in his fourties?

23
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:30,601
Do you... Oh, they've got
something for him, okay!

24
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,816
And how much would you be paying?

25
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:38,587
You've got more money
than sense, mate.

26
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:41,178
No, I'm his agent, yeah.

27
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:44,832
You know, I met a bloke once who said
he'd love to take me up the Amazon.

28
00:01:47,318 --> 00:01:48,368
What did you say?

29
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:50,528
I said: "Alright,
as long as you're paying."

30
00:01:52,956 --> 00:01:55,664
- What did he say?
- He was a bit shocked, to be honest.

31
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:56,727
Not surprised.

32
00:01:56,768 --> 00:01:58,897
Not as shocked as when I told him
I'd only do it

33
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,150
if we could take lots of photos
to show my mum.

34
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:02,514
Oh, finished.

35
00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:18,054
Knockety-knock-knock?
Hello!

36
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:19,107
Alright?

37
00:02:19,164 --> 00:02:22,045
Great show, brilliant show tonight.
Very very funny.

38
00:02:22,237 --> 00:02:23,792
What was your favourite bit?

39
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:26,499
- You didn't watch it, did you?
- It's not my cup of tea, to be honest.

40
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,665
If I'm being truthful,
it's not my thing. I can't get with it.

41
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:32,517
I'd like to talk some business.
How do you fancy 3 days with Billy Piper?

42
00:02:32,673 --> 00:02:35,870
- 3 days with Billie Piper?
- Good money. You'd be in and out.

43
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:36,988
What're you talking about?

44
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,555
Billy Piper.
Little magical kid with glasses.

45
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:41,581
D'you mean Harry Potter?

46
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:44,935
- What did I say?
- Billie Piper.

47
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:48,132
- I've heard of him. Who's he?
- She! She's an actress.

48
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:50,148
She's in "Doctor Who". She...

49
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,506
- Do you watch television?
- Do I watch television?

50
00:02:52,594 --> 00:02:55,826
I've just bought myself
a brand new 52 inch plasma TV set.

51
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:57,974
Fifty? That's way too big
for your flat.

52
00:02:58,027 --> 00:02:59,704
It is too big. I don't know
what I was thinking.

53
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,969
It's too bright. I was wiring it up,
and David Dickinson came on.

54
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,699
And his tan nearly
took my eyeballs out.

55
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:07,843
I'm all over the place, got headaches...
I've got it in a box now.

56
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:09,870
I'm just watching a little portable.

57
00:03:10,097 --> 00:03:11,931
You don't wanna buy a TV, do you?

58
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,568
- How much did you pay for it?
- 3,500 £.

59
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,629
What would you sell it to me for?

60
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:18,464
35,000 £, face value.

61
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:19,842
Obviously not.

62
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,023
No, you gotta give me
a discount, it's secondhand. 1,500 £.

63
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,516
That's an insult. I'd rather smash it up
than give it to you for 5,000£

64
00:03:26,603 --> 00:03:28,053
- That is pathetic.
- Alright.

65
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,493
This project, go on.

66
00:03:29,615 --> 00:03:31,571
Big british movie. Lots of stars.

67
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:33,677
Dame Diana Rigg's in it,
all sorts of people.

68
00:03:33,764 --> 00:03:35,790
I know you wanna get to movies,
so this could be a good in.

69
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:38,410
Plus, I checked with them straight away,
I said: "Will he still get paid..."

70
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,559
"even if his performance is crap?"
They said yes.

71
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:42,672
- So it's a win-win for us.
- You didn't ask'em that.

72
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,204
Because I was worried that if you got
a gig and they saw the sitcom,

73
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,654
they might fire you.

74
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,497
But they've already
seen the show, so...

75
00:03:48,654 --> 00:03:49,804
Oh, they've seen the show?

76
00:03:49,851 --> 00:03:52,601
Cause they're in the business
and they watch TV. There, yeah.

77
00:03:53,056 --> 00:03:55,553
- I wonder if they wanna buy a TV.
- Don't ask them.

78
00:03:55,658 --> 00:03:57,580
Alright, call'em and say yes,
I'm interested.

79
00:03:57,685 --> 00:03:59,903
And get Maggie some extra work,
I don't wanna spend

80
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:02,060
3 days with loads of actors
I don't know.

81
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,597
Nightmare.
Call'em out.

82
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,008
- Well, I'll call'em later.
- Non, call'em now.

83
00:04:06,165 --> 00:04:08,139
- I'll call'em outside.
- Call'em in here.

84
00:04:08,243 --> 00:04:10,479
No, I don't wanna call'em
in front of you.

85
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:13,833
- Don't ask if they wanna buy a telly.
- I might as well do it here, then.

86
00:04:16,907 --> 00:04:18,706
Ridiculous.

87
00:04:28,593 --> 00:04:32,174
- So, what scene are we starting with?
- 2nd of 1.4.1.

88
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,410
This is Warwick.

89
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:36,087
Nice to meet you.

90
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:38,323
This is my fiancée, Claire.

91
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,071
- So, do you know your lines?
- I've only got two.

92
00:04:44,612 --> 00:04:46,778
You're sure this food
is definitely free?

93
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:48,018
This is my agent.

94
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:50,865
- Darren Lamb, nice to meet you.
- This is Warwick.

95
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:51,861
Where?

96
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:54,725
Oh, midget. Hello.

97
00:04:54,883 --> 00:04:57,067
I'm gonna get some coffees.

98
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:00,944
- What was your name, sorry?
- It's Warwick.

99
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:03,756
Funny little name.

100
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:05,957
Can I just show you
where you're gonna be standing?

101
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:08,105
Yes.
Don't...

102
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,350
Are those your own clothes?

103
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:19,878
No.

104
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:23,550
Where do you get normal clothes from?
Are they children clothes?

105
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:25,310
Are they toy clothes?

106
00:05:25,364 --> 00:05:28,160
Like your shoes for instance,
are they like little toy bear's booties?

107
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,155
Like you sometimes see,
like a toy monkey...

108
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,985
with little trainers on. Would you have
a pair of them for yourself?

109
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:35,484
There are special shops,
and I do a lot of Internet shops.

110
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:37,083
Internet. That makes sense.
That's clever.

111
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:41,128
Can I fit in your house?

112
00:05:43,257 --> 00:05:46,117
- What're you talking about?
- Internet and stuff.

113
00:05:46,537 --> 00:05:47,410
Yeah, it should be a laugh.

114
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,351
Imagine if I followed him home
to his tiny little house, right?

115
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:51,370
And as he goes up to bed,
I put my face against the window

116
00:05:51,428 --> 00:05:53,786
just like Godzilla, just grrargh!
Freakim him out.

117
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:56,027
Reaching in through the window
like King Kong...

118
00:05:56,097 --> 00:05:57,206
What are you doing?!

119
00:05:57,288 --> 00:05:59,588
- I'm just having a chat...
- Why are you still here?

120
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:02,680
Don't!
We've got to learn our lines.

121
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,035
See you later.

122
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:09,638
- Agent?
- Idiot.

123
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,206
Wood elf?

124
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:25,957
Why do you cry?

125
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:28,969
Blow as I might...

126
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,572
My flute makes no sound.

127
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:33,322
Without my music...

128
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:36,334
The birds cannot sing
their morning song.

129
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:41,589
- May I take a look?
- Certainly, but...

130
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:43,783
I don't know what a boy can do.

131
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,072
Especially one dressed so...

132
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:48,068
strangely.

133
00:06:55,294 --> 00:06:56,741
Try it now.

134
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:09,959
Sweet music is born again!

135
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,036
But I am curious.

136
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:15,352
How did you know
you'd need such an implement?

137
00:07:16,076 --> 00:07:18,422
Always be prepared.

138
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:26,608
Ok, cut that. Thank you.
Check the gate.

139
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:29,323
Can I get a drink of water, please?

140
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,078
- You married?
- Yes.

141
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:37,923
That don't stop me.

142
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:40,806
A ring don't mean a thing.

143
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:49,052
This chair free?

144
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:51,200
Uh... yeah.

145
00:07:57,036 --> 00:07:58,355
How you doing?

146
00:07:58,484 --> 00:07:59,488
Okay.

147
00:08:00,585 --> 00:08:02,966
God, I still got these on.
I don't need these.

148
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:04,635
They're just for the character.

149
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,558
Even if I did need glasses
in my life, you know... I never read.

150
00:08:09,304 --> 00:08:10,320
Right.

151
00:08:17,522 --> 00:08:18,316
What?

152
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:20,838
Fags.

153
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:26,791
You smoke, do you?

154
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:30,176
Me? Oh, yeah.
Just a little bit. You?

155
00:08:30,305 --> 00:08:30,946
No.

156
00:08:31,226 --> 00:08:34,647
No? Good girl. Very wise.
I've got to put down, really.

157
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,130
I've done it with a girl.

158
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:41,437
What?

159
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,145
I've done it with a girl.
Intercourse-wise.

160
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:46,783
- So if you're looking for...
<i>- Daniel?</i>

161
00:08:46,842 --> 00:08:48,931
It's my mum.
Say they're your fags.

162
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,604
What're you doing?

163
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:54,020
Nothing.
She's tried to give me fags!

164
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:54,849
No, I'm not!

165
00:08:54,907 --> 00:08:57,394
You should know better,
you're old enough to be his mother!

166
00:08:57,476 --> 00:08:58,935
And she was trying
to have it off with me.

167
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:01,981
Well, of course she was.
You're bloody gorgeous. Come on, you.

168
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:23,249
- Makes me sick.
- What?

169
00:09:23,377 --> 00:09:25,408
These showbiz dwarves...

170
00:09:25,513 --> 00:09:27,941
who use their powers
to get women out of their league.

171
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:30,229
- What, Warwick?
- No, Paul Daniels.

172
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,868
If she's into short men,
you could bear with a chance.

173
00:09:35,915 --> 00:09:37,841
- I'm not short.
- Yeah, you are.

174
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:39,580
5'8, average height.

175
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,156
Well, average in <i>your</i> days.

176
00:09:41,238 --> 00:09:43,479
- My days? Born in the sixties.
- Early sixties.

177
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:45,160
- Quite, yeah.
- 1960.

178
00:09:45,207 --> 00:09:47,343
- No.
- 1961?

179
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:51,335
- That'd be why you didn't grow.
- I did grow!

180
00:09:51,394 --> 00:09:54,159
With all the powdered egg
and the rationing and everything.

181
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:56,576
- That was the war!
- Yeah, whatever.

182
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:57,901
Do you know what?

183
00:09:58,017 --> 00:09:59,733
You've got small man complex.

184
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:00,691
But what's that?

185
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:05,131
You're bad-tempered, grumpy, you
want power and people to respect you.

186
00:10:05,176 --> 00:10:09,965
Like that little famous person,
what's his name? Begins with an "N".

187
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:12,034
- Napoleon?
- Noel Edmunds.

188
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,807
I'm not short.
I'm average high. And that's...

189
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:17,644
I can see
how it is upsetting for you.

190
00:10:17,728 --> 00:10:19,969
Cause there's him,
he's even smaller than you are...

191
00:10:20,027 --> 00:10:21,626
- Cause I'm not small.
- He's getting all these...

192
00:10:21,743 --> 00:10:23,926
- attractive and beautiful women.
- We all are.

193
00:10:23,996 --> 00:10:25,186
But you get nothing.

194
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,078
Well, I'm getting'em.

195
00:10:27,136 --> 00:10:29,611
There was the one
that looked like Ronnie Corbet.

196
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:31,758
- We know why you went for her.
- Why?

197
00:10:31,817 --> 00:10:34,186
Cause you could look her in the eye.

198
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:35,972
It's not a competition.

199
00:10:36,043 --> 00:10:38,751
It's not like she saw us both
and went "Oh, I like the short one".

200
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:40,373
- Is that you or him?
- Him!

201
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,046
- See? There's the temper.
- I'm saying...

202
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:45,182
If she'd had met us both
at the same time...

203
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:47,667
We don't know
who she'd had chosen.

204
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:51,067
I think I know.

205
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:52,386
She'd had chosen the one...

206
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:53,822
Who ?

207
00:10:54,032 --> 00:10:56,915
Don't know what to say.
It'll sound arrogant I don't wanna...

208
00:10:57,219 --> 00:11:00,172
But if she was single
and she met us both...

209
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:02,570
Tell me?

210
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:04,859
Oh for f... Just think.

211
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:06,668
- I'm thinking.
- Your own thoughts.

212
00:11:06,738 --> 00:11:08,641
Stay out of mine.

213
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:15,945
- A bit stodgy, innit?
- Honestly, I'm sick of this.

214
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:18,708
Can we get something nice tonight?
My treat, but a proper restaurant.

215
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:19,370
Yeah.

216
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:24,447
Hey, guys.
What're we doing?

217
00:11:24,636 --> 00:11:25,709
Just been eating.

218
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:29,146
Yeah, sweet. Look, thanks
for covering my ass earlier.

219
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:31,435
The offer still stands.

220
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:32,919
What offer?

221
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,560
You know...

222
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:41,303
I was gonna go and get a drink.
Does anybody want anything?

223
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:43,433
- A cup of tea.
- Give me a bourbon, babe.

224
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:44,937
I think it's mostly
just teas and coffees.

225
00:11:45,006 --> 00:11:48,762
Then give me a cup of joe. Make it
strong, I don't want the weak shit.

226
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:56,839
When she comes back, make some excuse
and leave us alone, will you?

227
00:11:57,869 --> 00:11:59,371
What do you have planned?

228
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:08,175
- You unravelled it?
- Ready for action.

229
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:10,166
Let's just hope it's big enough.

230
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:19,162
Can I have my johnny back?

231
00:12:20,052 --> 00:12:23,686
"<i>May</i> I have my johnny back".

232
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:26,035
- Please.
- Yeah.

233
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,690
It's not called a johnny there, is it?

234
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:31,695
- Durex?
- No, that's a brand name.

235
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:35,800
"May I have back
my prophylactic or sheath?"

236
00:12:35,914 --> 00:12:39,460
May I have my prophylac...

237
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:41,049
...tic.

238
00:12:41,818 --> 00:12:43,914
Can I have it please?

239
00:12:48,928 --> 00:12:52,561
Excuse me?
Haven't you forgotten something?

240
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:55,583
Oh, thank you, Dame Diana.

241
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:00,718
- Still will be using it?
- Yeah, that'll be fine.

242
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:02,728
Lucky girl.

243
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,191
You're getting married to...?

244
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,593
That's really nice of you.

245
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:32,230
It's really "nice" of me?

246
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:36,422
Me and my friend Andy -
Andy Millman - were talking...

247
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:40,318
and he was surprised
that you'd chosen someone like...

248
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:45,175
...Warwick, over someone...
Someone like him, who's...

249
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:47,935
Do you only like small people?

250
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,376
I don't like cause he's small,
but cause he has a nice personality.

251
00:13:51,481 --> 00:13:54,415
Well, that's good then.
Because Andy was saying

252
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:58,065
that if you didn't mind someone who's
a little bit taller, he's up for it.

253
00:14:00,178 --> 00:14:01,436
Sorry, so...

254
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:04,440
Your friend is so arrogant
he thinks he just has to get the word,

255
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,026
and I would immediately
leave my fiancé for him...

256
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,912
because he's taller.

257
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:11,602
Do you understand
how offensive that is?

258
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:17,210
- It's a bit out of order, isn't it?
- It is out of order.

259
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:21,087
He shouldn't have said that, should he?
- No, he shouldn't have.

260
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:27,778
Yes!

261
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,735
This is alright, innit?

262
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:32,127
Share the wealth.

263
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:35,603
Kid's doing wild, isn't he?

264
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:38,555
It's a lovely place though, eh,
but depressing though.

265
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,498
Why?

266
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,970
Here I am with <i>you</i> in a nice place,
instead of a proper man.

267
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:45,384
None taken.

268
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:47,236
I mean like, on a date.

269
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:50,991
The only person with money that
finds me attractive is a teenage boy.

270
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:54,450
Could be worse. He's a film star,
he's got his own condom...

271
00:14:55,026 --> 00:14:58,608
Excuse me. Hi.
I know this isn't really...

272
00:14:58,782 --> 00:15:00,826
- Could I please get your autograph?
- Yeah, sure.

273
00:15:02,171 --> 00:15:04,651
- To Emma.
- No worries.

274
00:15:04,774 --> 00:15:06,101
You could do me a favour, actually.

275
00:15:06,224 --> 00:15:09,385
Can you tell the woman to shut
her kid up? He's doing my head in.

276
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:12,128
Cheers.

277
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:14,940
I'll never get used to that.

278
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:16,722
Why does someone want
a name on a piece of paper?

279
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,591
I know, it's a bit weird.

280
00:15:21,491 --> 00:15:23,692
Oh, she's told him it's you.

281
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:25,909
She's coming over.

282
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:28,737
Excuse me.

283
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:31,603
I understand you have a problem with me
bringing my son into a restaurant?

284
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:33,009
If he's like that, yes.

285
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:36,311
- What do you mean, "like that"?
- Why should <i>we</i> be burdened

286
00:15:36,415 --> 00:15:37,445
Andy, don't...

287
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:40,921
You think that because you're on TV,
you can order the rest of the world around?

288
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:42,440
It's nothing to do with that.

289
00:15:42,563 --> 00:15:46,178
But he's gonna make that sort of noise...
It's a restaurant, for God's sake.

290
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:49,567
- It's not my fault, is it?
- Yes it is, you decided to have it.

291
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:52,118
Of course, I decided to have him.

292
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:55,332
You'll be pleased to know
we're about to leave anyway. So...

293
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:57,183
I hope you have
a wonderful evening,

294
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:59,314
and that you realise
you're a horrible little man.

295
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:01,480
Oh, not even realising.

296
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,896
- I didn't realise...
- I was trying to tell you.

297
00:16:11,018 --> 00:16:13,953
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I was trying to tell you...

298
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:29,224
Hello, Andy. How's it going, mate?
Paul, mate.

299
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:30,237
I was just passing.

300
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,979
Wanna clear up all this nonsense about
you having a go at Down Syndrome people?

301
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:34,958
We've had this woman
come to us saying that

302
00:16:35,046 --> 00:16:36,848
you were having a go
at her kid who's Down's and that.

303
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:38,821
Sorry, are you a journalist?

304
00:16:38,905 --> 00:16:40,180
Sort of, mate. Just freelance.

305
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,503
Just trying to turn this round
to get the truth out there, if you may.

306
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,716
So what happened?
The Down syndrome's making a racket,

307
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,358
you tell him to shut up
and suddenly his mum's up...

308
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:48,383
I didn't tell him to shut up.
I didn't tell anyone to shut up.

309
00:16:48,452 --> 00:16:51,376
The world's gone mad.
You can't say what you think anymore.

310
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:54,595
I didn't know he was
Down syndrom, for a start.

311
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:56,092
So you're in a restaurant
with your girlfriend...

312
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:58,141
- She's not my girlfriend.
- But she's a girl and a friend.

313
00:16:58,228 --> 00:17:00,516
- I'll put "girlfriend". Psycho.
- She's not my girlfriend.

314
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:02,677
- What psycho girlfriend? She's not...
- Short hand...

315
00:17:02,747 --> 00:17:05,525
And you heard a noise and
it was driving you mad.

316
00:17:05,629 --> 00:17:07,526
Can't say "mad" nowadays, can you?

317
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:09,342
He was making a noise
and I got a little...

318
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:11,307
Mad. The mad kid
was driving you mad.

319
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,741
Can't say "mad", nowadays, can you?
Or "mental".

320
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:17,001
I wouldn't say... Can you make it clear
I didn't know it was Down syndrome?

321
00:17:17,106 --> 00:17:18,643
- I will, I will.
- Put that down.

322
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:21,281
Are you actually
writing anything there?

323
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,093
So, you complained,
the mum came over, she went nuts.

324
00:17:24,163 --> 00:17:25,945
- Well, she was agitated...
- So <i>she</i> went mad?

325
00:17:26,032 --> 00:17:28,250
You could say she was going
madder than her son

326
00:17:28,303 --> 00:17:29,962
Would you say she was going mental?

327
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,360
- Say "mental".
- No.

328
00:17:31,465 --> 00:17:34,416
Can't say "mental" nowadays, can you?
If you wanna say "mental", you can't.

329
00:17:34,556 --> 00:17:37,141
- I've gotta go.
- Cheers, mate. Got everything I need.

330
00:17:38,734 --> 00:17:42,070
"In a shocking outburst that would stun
comedy fans everywhere,

331
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:45,389
so cool TV funny man
Andy Millman lost his temper

332
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:47,433
and blasted a Down syndrome child

333
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,049
for supposedly ruining his dinner
at a 100£ a head restaurant."

334
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:52,551
100£ a head?

335
00:17:52,743 --> 00:17:53,983
It was about 80 quid...

336
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:56,411
200 quid for a meal for two people?
How the other half live?

337
00:17:56,498 --> 00:17:57,966
Sorry, that makes me sick.

338
00:17:58,018 --> 00:18:00,097
"Millman had been glugging
red wine with his girlfriend."

339
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,669
- Ah, pissed.
- I got one drink.

340
00:18:01,757 --> 00:18:03,486
- Did you glug it, though?
- Did I what?

341
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:06,525
- It says here you glugged it.
- I don't know what glugging is.

342
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,595
Never glug. Always sip
a lovely wine, never glug it.

343
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:12,149
Can we stop saying "glug"?

344
00:18:12,534 --> 00:18:15,975
I wasn't even drinking red wine,
Maggie was. I had a beer.

345
00:18:16,027 --> 00:18:18,159
"Millman had been glugging red wine...

346
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,914
and let off a tirade of abuse at the
innocent child and the stunned mother,

347
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,766
who he claimed was
"as mad as her son".

348
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,548
- I didn't say that!
- Someone did.

349
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:28,137
Says Madam Maureen Wilson:
"I used to be a fan of Andy's,

350
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:32,138
but after his torrent of hate, if he
thinks I'll ever his program again..."

351
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,042
Here. "...he's having a laugh."

352
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,028
She used your old catch-phrase against you,
stitched you up. It's clever, witty.

353
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:41,866
As if she ever said that. As if she's
making little jokes, being that angry.

354
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:46,075
So. What can we do
about this, can we sue?

355
00:18:46,163 --> 00:18:47,281
I don't think it's worth it.

356
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:49,360
This sort of thing,
tomorrow it's fish and chip paper.

357
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:51,282
Although he's not having
fish and chips anymore.

358
00:18:51,352 --> 00:18:53,046
You'd have trouble doing 200£
in a chippy, wouldn't you?

359
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:56,137
- I didn't spend 200 quid.
- It says 230 in this one.

360
00:18:56,207 --> 00:18:57,692
- Lies.
- No, it does.

361
00:18:57,797 --> 00:18:59,753
I don't mean you're lying,
I mean <i>they're</i> lying.

362
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,832
They make stuff up, don't they?

363
00:19:01,972 --> 00:19:03,055
Don't know about that.

364
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,570
You've never heard of
a paper making stuff up?

365
00:19:06,492 --> 00:19:08,815
Of course, they do.
They made stuff up about you too.

366
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:11,505
When they said you went in
to the EastEnders bosses

367
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:13,418
to beg for his job back
and you're on your knees,

368
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:16,527
and then you burst into tears.
They made that up.

369
00:19:18,135 --> 00:19:19,655
Didn't they?

370
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:23,620
Bullshit.

371
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:27,742
I guess only time will tell.
Anything else?

372
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:30,938
Let's move to the story
about the actor Andy Millman.

373
00:19:31,025 --> 00:19:31,934
Who is he?

374
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:34,222
He's that guy, he does
the "is he having a laugh?".

375
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:39,305
Ok. He's in a restaurant and
he's insulted a Down syndrome boy.

376
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:41,593
Both mother and son
are completely devastated,

377
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,655
because it was an unprovoked attack.

378
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,948
Did he hit him?!

379
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,272
It doesn't say.

380
00:19:46,328 --> 00:19:50,153
If he <i>did</i> strike the boy,
then he deserved to be banned from TV.

381
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:54,065
So, have you heard about this?

382
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:58,484
TV actor Andy Millman
has hit a Down syndrome child.

383
00:19:58,554 --> 00:20:01,628
Today we're asking
our celebrities out of control:

384
00:20:01,716 --> 00:20:05,392
is it one rule for us
and an other for the rich and famous?

385
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:08,047
Tony's on the line. What do you make
of this Millman character?

386
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:11,297
<i>What can you say?
It's disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.</i>

387
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:13,725
<i>Excuse my french,
but I think he's a shit.</i>

388
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,607
No, you're excused in this case
because I think you're right.

389
00:20:16,695 --> 00:20:19,507
I don't normally tolerate
foul language on the air, but...

390
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,725
What else can you say
about this piece of work?

391
00:20:21,777 --> 00:20:24,939
<i>The thing is, I heard he also
hit the mother. Punch in the face!</i>

392
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:27,926
He punched the mother?!
Oh, my God.

393
00:20:27,996 --> 00:20:31,175
Tony, thank you. That gives
a whole fresh new light to the story.

394
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,057
Coming up today:
what made rising star Andy Millman

395
00:20:34,127 --> 00:20:36,345
punch a defenseless
Down syndrome child

396
00:20:36,433 --> 00:20:39,385
and his elderly
wheel-chair bound mother in the face?

397
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:41,446
Denise Robertson will be here to speculate.

398
00:20:41,516 --> 00:20:43,314
Plus, Rwanda revisited.

399
00:20:43,402 --> 00:20:45,183
12 years after the genocide,

400
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:48,834
a harrowing report from
Big Brother 2 winner, Brian Dowling.

401
00:20:49,026 --> 00:20:52,904
Andy, quick, come here!
Look.

402
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,507
What the f...

403
00:20:56,467 --> 00:21:00,083
<i>It's great to clear the air. I know
there's been a lot of press speculation</i>

404
00:21:00,223 --> 00:21:02,354
- What's he doing?
- <i>I spoke to Andy...</i>

405
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:04,275
<i>and he's explained
everything to me.</i>

406
00:21:04,362 --> 00:21:06,720
The truth is this:
he is successful,

407
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,956
and he wanted to go to
a classy restaurant.

408
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:11,716
You know, I'm sure
you sometimes want it yourself.

409
00:21:11,873 --> 00:21:14,493
As he said to me,
he's got some cash now.

410
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,022
He does not wanna have to associate
with riffraff, and why should he?

411
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:20,170
<i>So, he's in this posh restaurant
with his friend</i>

412
00:21:20,222 --> 00:21:22,284
and there is a mother in there
with a kid.

413
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:25,131
And the kid's making a lot of noise,
a little racket.

414
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:27,594
He's ruining it for everyone.
Andy's obviously furious.

415
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:29,013
Andy, because...

416
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,048
he's paying through the nose
for this grub. I mean it's silly money.

417
00:21:32,117 --> 00:21:35,278
So he complains to the mother,
and they get into this ruck.

418
00:21:35,366 --> 00:21:40,035
And the thing is, he didn't realise
that the kid was...

419
00:21:40,122 --> 00:21:41,921
mentally deranged, or whatever.

420
00:21:42,026 --> 00:21:43,470
Cause he could
only see him from behind.

421
00:21:43,527 --> 00:21:46,794
And I defy anyone to be able
to identify from behind...

422
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,309
you know,
one of these Mongoloids.

423
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:51,074
<i>I'm sorry, a Mongoloid?</i>

424
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,712
Yeah, no, I mean if you had
a bunch of people line up over there

425
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:57,589
and one of them was a Mongoloid,
and they had their backs to you...

426
00:21:57,677 --> 00:21:59,651
I defy anyone to be able
to tell which one it was.

427
00:21:59,738 --> 00:22:00,908
I think I could.

428
00:22:00,996 --> 00:22:03,109
Big words, Richard,
but I don't think you could.

429
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,642
I'm sorry, I think I could.

430
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:08,839
Can we try and sort that out
for tomorrow? Just get a few in?

431
00:22:08,978 --> 00:22:10,742
I don't think we can do that, Richard.

432
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,520
Come on, Judy. Let's see,
it'llbe interesting, just try it out.

433
00:22:13,695 --> 00:22:15,406
Darren, thank you very much.

434
00:22:15,494 --> 00:22:18,550
Oh, before I go,
do you remember Barry of EastEnders?

435
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:23,633
He's recorded a CD,
did it in his garage.

436
00:22:23,703 --> 00:22:26,690
It's only available on the Internet.
It's Barry singing songs from the shows.

437
00:22:26,777 --> 00:22:29,397
- He's got a lovely voice, Richard.
<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>

438
00:22:29,537 --> 00:22:33,502
Good, that's sorted out.
At least I've got my best man on it.

439
00:22:39,161 --> 00:22:42,375
Yeah, can I have
the Sun newspaper, please?

440
00:22:45,153 --> 00:22:47,755
Thanks, everyone.
Now, Dougie.

441
00:22:47,843 --> 00:22:52,087
I asked your mum what's the one thing
you'd most like in the whole world,

442
00:22:52,157 --> 00:22:55,284
and she said an X-Box.
Is that right?

443
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,484
What have we got here, then?

444
00:22:57,677 --> 00:23:00,961
Oh, thank you.

445
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,830
Do you apologise then, Andy?

446
00:23:02,865 --> 00:23:05,416
That wasn't a case of apology,
just a misunderstanding.

447
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:06,777
No apology necessary.

448
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:10,253
- The X-Box is apology enough.
- It was not an apology.

449
00:23:10,376 --> 00:23:13,781
- And you're happy with that?
- Very happy.

450
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:16,628
- Can I just say, as a further apology.
- It was not an apology.

451
00:23:16,716 --> 00:23:19,231
We've talked with Maureen, and
we both agreed it would be appropriate

452
00:23:19,318 --> 00:23:21,903
if Andy to donate to a charity
of Maureen's choosing

453
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,767
his entire fee for the film
he's currently working on.

454
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,217
After agency's deductions.

455
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:29,187
That's very generous.
It's a lovely surprise.

456
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:32,610
It <i>is</i> a surprise.
A big surprise.

457
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,861
We know who I am.
What's your name?

458
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:04,167
My name is Claire.

459
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:07,031
You have a lovely necklace on, Claire.

460
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:09,354
Thank you. It's very nice, thanks.

461
00:24:11,154 --> 00:24:12,412
Would you...

462
00:24:12,971 --> 00:24:15,154
...fancy dinner?
Are you free tonight?

463
00:24:15,277 --> 00:24:16,866
I'm not, actually, no.

464
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,482
I'm engaged.

465
00:24:18,534 --> 00:24:20,944
- Lunch, tomorrow?
- No, thank you.

466
00:24:21,031 --> 00:24:24,045
I'm not going out
for any meal with you.

467
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:26,630
Not even brunch?

468
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,106
No, not even brunch.

469
00:24:36,394 --> 00:24:38,839
Hey, Maggie, listen.

470
00:24:39,223 --> 00:24:43,048
I'm gonna cut to the chase, because
I respect you too much to bullshit you.

471
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,371
It's over. Yeah?

472
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,869
- Sorry?
- It's over between us.

473
00:24:47,957 --> 00:24:50,594
I don't want tears, that's the kind
of guy I am, you knew that going in.

474
00:24:50,681 --> 00:24:52,175
I just think it's better
we end things now

475
00:24:52,244 --> 00:24:54,620
before you fall in love with me
any deeper.

476
00:24:54,751 --> 00:24:58,192
You knew it wasn't forever. I said
it was playtime. We had some laughs, but...

477
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,969
I cannot be tied down to one chick.

478
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:06,069
I don't wanna waste this on you.

479
00:25:06,383 --> 00:25:08,200
I've got a better bird now.

480
00:25:09,056 --> 00:25:11,012
Well, thanks for your honesty.

481
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:21,118
- Something to remember me by.
- You brushed your teeth today?

482
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:22,183
- Yes!
- Yes.

483
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:24,271
- Oi, Radcliffe!
- What?

484
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:26,699
- What've you been up to?
- Nothing.

485
00:25:26,804 --> 00:25:30,804
Don't lie. You've been chatting up
my fiancée, she just told me!

486
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,064
Mum?

487
00:25:32,146 --> 00:25:34,445
Don't call for your mum.
You were chatting up my bird.

488
00:25:34,515 --> 00:25:36,271
So act like a man and
deal with the consequences.

489
00:25:36,376 --> 00:25:38,699
- I was just...
- "I was just neeh-neeh-neeh".

490
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:41,162
- You speccy little git.
- These aren't real glasses.

491
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:43,729
- You're a speccy git.
- Leave him alone, he's just a boy.

492
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:46,035
- I'm 17.
- What's it got to do with you?

493
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,345
- He's doing nothing, is he?
- Don't stick your big nose in, love.

494
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,476
- Alright, calm down.
- Oh, you!

495
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,043
I'm glad you're here,
'cause you had the same idea.

496
00:25:54,148 --> 00:25:56,190
I know you said
your little mate in here

497
00:25:56,261 --> 00:25:58,987
to do your dirty work for you,
trying to undermine me.

498
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:00,244
What've you done?

499
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:02,742
- Nothing.
- You think it's ok, do you?

500
00:26:02,882 --> 00:26:04,488
Trying to steal my fiancée?

501
00:26:04,585 --> 00:26:07,240
- I don't know... what're you doing?
- You shit!

502
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:11,100
- What do you think I got this ring for?
- I don't know, you're a hobbit?

503
00:26:11,204 --> 00:26:13,334
- You fat shit!
- I don't... the rules to fight with a...

504
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,523
Let me try that.

505
00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:18,419
That usually works in cartoons.
What're you doing, mate?

506
00:26:23,346 --> 00:26:24,725
Accident on...

507
00:26:25,494 --> 00:26:26,577
...knee.

508
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:28,272
Wh... What are you doing?

509
00:26:28,342 --> 00:26:31,660
Lucky shot. He was going mad at me.
Instead of the face...

510
00:26:31,765 --> 00:26:34,281
- Sweetheart, Warwick.
- He's not...

511
00:26:34,805 --> 00:26:35,888
He's breathing.

512
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:38,263
It's alright, he's breathing.

513
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,172
Have you still got that cat suit
from the Avengers?

514
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:44,849
Go away, Daniel.

515
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,097
His eyes are open.
Right, okay, let's move on.

516
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:51,503
Remember that charity you promised
to give half of your film fee to?

517
00:26:51,572 --> 00:26:54,314
You mean, the charity <i>you</i> promised
to give half of my film fee to...

518
00:26:54,755 --> 00:26:56,907
Well, they're basically quite keen
to get hold of the cash.

519
00:26:56,952 --> 00:26:59,695
Yeah, but I was kicked out,
so there is no fee.

520
00:26:59,747 --> 00:27:01,825
But there's expecting the money.
We gotta give it to them.

521
00:27:01,895 --> 00:27:04,166
They don't know
what the fee was, do they?

522
00:27:04,305 --> 00:27:07,536
They do.
Cause I mentioned it to them.

523
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,405
I've got to give them
wages I haven't even earned ?

524
00:27:09,493 --> 00:27:11,020
It's okay, 'cause we can pay'em
the money we owe them

525
00:27:11,073 --> 00:27:12,218
from the money
we get for the sitcom.

526
00:27:12,306 --> 00:27:14,086
- How much is it?
- About a half.

527
00:27:14,157 --> 00:27:15,223
Half an episode?

528
00:27:15,415 --> 00:27:16,602
Well, half the all series.

529
00:27:16,672 --> 00:27:18,960
I gotta give them a half my wages
for the entire series?

530
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,742
Not my fault, you're the one
who assaulted the kid with...

531
00:27:20,794 --> 00:27:22,017
I didn't assault him,
I didn't know he was...

532
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:25,143
You must have upset him in some way
'cause you made it into the papers.

533
00:27:25,283 --> 00:27:27,536
Talking of the papers,
you've made quite a splash again.

534
00:27:27,624 --> 00:27:30,820
But annoyingly, they didn't go with
the "giving the kid an X-Box" angle.

535
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,182
What'd they go with?

536
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:34,960
"TV bully kicks dwarf in face"

537
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:38,208
Accurate. But, as you say,
there's no such thing as bad publicity.

538
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:39,955
"Pick on someone
your own size fatty"?

539
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:42,889
- Oh, maybe there is.
- This is the worst one.

540
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:45,912
"Suicide bombers get lotto funding."
Look at that.

541
00:27:46,034 --> 00:27:47,624
What's it have got to do with me?

542
00:27:47,781 --> 00:27:49,790
Well, nothing.
It's just shocking.

543
00:27:51,787 --> 00:27:54,739
No, actually, what am I talking about.
This is the worst one, in the Mail.

544
00:27:54,803 --> 00:27:57,040
"Gipsies are eating our pets".

545
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,874
Subtitles: Nathbot & Quarkienette
Thanks Phil

Watch the credits until the end ;)

547
00:28:28,557 --> 00:28:30,930
Yeah, I know. It's number 3.

548
00:28:32,998 --> 00:28:34,074
Damned!
