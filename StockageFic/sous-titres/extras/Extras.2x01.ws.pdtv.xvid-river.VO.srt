1
00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:03,760
Maybe I'm stupid.

2
00:00:03,938 --> 00:00:08,647
Maybe the jury's stupid.
So many things don't add up.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,895
You say you were
in a restaurant.

4
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:12,651
You ate alone.

5
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:15,140
But no one remembers you.

6
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:18,284
And the flowers...

7
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:22,128
The flowers...

8
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:26,137
It seems very odd that you would
send your wife flowers

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,418
and not include a card.

10
00:00:29,248 --> 00:00:31,889
Whenever I sent my wife flowers,
I always wrote a card.

11
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,797
Objection!

12
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:36,229
When did you ever
send me flowers?

13
00:00:36,326 --> 00:00:37,128
I sent you flowers.

14
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:39,671
Name me one occasion
when you sent me flowers.

15
00:00:39,754 --> 00:00:41,012
After your mother died.

16
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:43,846
- A wreath doesn't count.
- Of course it does.

17
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:45,975
Does that count?

18
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:49,141
My Lord, does that count?

19
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:50,634
It's still flowers.

20
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:52,736
You asked, when did I
ever send you flowers.

21
00:00:52,805 --> 00:00:54,630
Let's stick to the fact,
shall we?

22
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:56,828
Shove your fact
and your flowers...

23
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:58,583
Order!

24
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,113
I order you...

25
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:03,989
to kiss and make up.

26
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,233
- My Lord?
- You heard me.

27
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:49,849
Hello?

28
00:01:50,084 --> 00:01:50,969
Oi.

29
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:52,254
<i>Hey, how're you doing?</i>

30
00:01:52,323 --> 00:01:53,996
- Nervous.
- <i>Why?</i>

31
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:56,443
- Bug night, tonight.
- Why, what's happening?

32
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:58,543
- Filming the sitcom.
- <i>What sitcom?</i>

33
00:01:58,612 --> 00:02:00,645
My sitcom!
You're coming down!

34
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:02,110
Oh, yeah.

35
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,958
- <i>I thought it was next week.</i>
- No, it's tonight, 7:30.

36
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,908
Then every thursday
for six weeks.

37
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:09,378
- Put it in your diary.
- I haven't got a diary.

38
00:02:09,434 --> 00:02:10,624
It's a figure of speech.

39
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:12,251
<i>You do the speech?</i>

40
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,372
This has been helpful,
I'm glad I called.

41
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:17,331
- Let me know how it goes, eh?
- You're coming down!

42
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,566
Alright, then.
What time does it start?

43
00:02:20,994 --> 00:02:22,321
7:30.

44
00:02:22,418 --> 00:02:25,846
- <i>Alright then. Bye.</i>
- Alright. Cheers.

45
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:41,416
Alright, see you later. Bye.

46
00:02:41,665 --> 00:02:43,365
- Hiya.
- Hi.

47
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,891
- What were you rolling your eyes at?
- Just at that lot, all...

48
00:02:46,987 --> 00:02:48,743
Fawning all over you.

49
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:50,416
That must get a bit
exhausting, eh?

50
00:02:50,485 --> 00:02:52,475
Yeah, it can be pretty exhausting.

51
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:55,364
Especially 'cause they're just
doing it 'cause you're famous.

52
00:02:55,516 --> 00:02:57,770
Well, they're not doing it
just 'cause I'm famous.

53
00:02:57,853 --> 00:02:59,443
No but it is though, innit?

54
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:01,558
No. Smart looks as well.

55
00:03:02,526 --> 00:03:06,328
I still think they wouldn't be acting
like that if you weren't a film star.

56
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,134
Yeah, I think they pretty much would,
I've always had attention.

57
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:12,466
No, all I'm saying is,
if you were the prop boy,

58
00:03:12,618 --> 00:03:14,194
you'd just get ignored.

59
00:03:15,508 --> 00:03:18,604
What, with this face?
I wouldn't get ignored.

60
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:21,867
I'll tell you who does
get ignored. Johnny Depp.

61
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:23,761
On the set of
Pirates of the Caribbean,

62
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:25,309
the buzz birds would just walk
straight past him.

63
00:03:25,392 --> 00:03:28,240
"Get out of the bloody way, whoever
you are, we wanna get to Orlando."

64
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,230
They ran to me
like flies around shit.

65
00:03:30,313 --> 00:03:31,889
- They ignored Johnny Depp?
- Yeah.

66
00:03:31,972 --> 00:03:35,676
They go: "Orlando, who's that
freak over there that we didn't notice?"

67
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:39,091
I'm going, "It's Johnny Depp",
and they go "Pff, who cares?"

68
00:03:39,174 --> 00:03:41,261
"You were Legolas
in Lord of the Rings!"

69
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:44,123
Ooh, look at me,
I'm in arthouse movies!

70
00:03:44,206 --> 00:03:46,653
Oh, I've got scissors for hands!

71
00:03:46,888 --> 00:03:49,777
Willy Wonka?
Johnny Wanker.

72
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:00,591
Hey, buddy.

73
00:04:00,771 --> 00:04:03,094
Alright?
How's it going, all set?

74
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:04,614
I'm not sure
I'm doing the right thing.

75
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,355
This is not the comedy
I signed to do.

76
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,825
I wanted to write something...
real, that people would rely to,

77
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:12,190
and it's all changed 'cause
people stuck their nose in it.

78
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:15,355
I'm hearing you. Alright, but you know what?
This is typical first night nerves.

79
00:04:15,452 --> 00:04:17,912
You're thinking,
"the script is not funny,

80
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:20,249
it's crass, it's lowest
common denominator",

81
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:21,728
and you're right.

82
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:24,300
But don't worry about it,
'cause people will watch anything.

83
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:26,871
Particularly if it's right after "Eastenders",
they haven't got to change the channel.

84
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:29,457
Those sort of morons will help us
win the ratings war.

85
00:04:29,526 --> 00:04:31,572
And you know, ratings
in the end are what count.

86
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:32,346
And merchandise.

87
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:33,536
It's no account to me, alright?

88
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:36,495
I wanna write a good credible comedy
that will stand the test of time.

89
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:39,595
Okay, I agree, I said that 'cause I thought
that's what you wanted me to say.

90
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:41,741
Well don't.
Tell the truth.

91
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,801
Well I will, and the truth is,
if you're not happy,

92
00:04:43,857 --> 00:04:45,308
- I'm right behind you.
- Right.

93
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:47,418
- And I've got the perfect replacement.
- For what?

94
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,541
For you, for your character.
It's only Barry.

95
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:52,705
Alright, Shaun?

96
00:04:52,754 --> 00:04:54,878
He's all set, knows all the lines,
he's ready to go, he can step in.

97
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:55,932
What's your character catch phrase?

98
00:04:55,982 --> 00:04:58,226
Not a catch phrase. Something
the real Ray did actually say.

99
00:04:58,269 --> 00:04:59,224
What was it?

100
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,283
"You're having a laugh?
Is he having a laugh?"

101
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:03,826
Look at that. Nothing.

102
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,403
Stoney face. I love a giggle, me,
I love a laugh, don't I?

103
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,040
You do it.

104
00:05:07,196 --> 00:05:09,524
"You're having a laugh?
Is he having a laugh?"

105
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:11,534
He's good, I don't know
how he comes up with it.

106
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,942
He didn't come up with it.

107
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:15,894
The thing about Barry is, I've noticed
this, people will laugh <i>at</i> him.

108
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:18,255
They never laugh <i>with</i> him.
That's extraordinary.

109
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:19,317
Look at that face.

110
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:21,589
They's a sort of undercurrent
of tragedy to it.

111
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,276
Do it.

112
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:26,402
I love it
because he's desperate.

113
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,571
Yeah, the role's taken.
Cheers.

114
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,482
***, hello.
How's it going, alright?

115
00:05:31,654 --> 00:05:33,643
- Everything alright?
- I think so. Damon?

116
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:37,019
Yeah, everybody's in, rehearsal
should kick off about 20 past.

117
00:05:37,394 --> 00:05:41,105
Just one teeny itsy
wincy little hiccup.

118
00:05:41,183 --> 00:05:43,172
Paul Shane's dropped out.

119
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,319
Why?

120
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:47,051
He was worried
it was a little bit too broad.

121
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:49,790
Paul Shane thinks
this is too broad? Right.

122
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:52,598
Well, it's only a little part, isn't it?
We've got a replacement.

123
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,630
- Keith's on its way.
- Keith?

124
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,422
- Keith... Chegwin.
- Keith Chegwin?!

125
00:05:57,532 --> 00:05:59,661
Can he act?
He's a tv presenter, isn't he?

126
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,813
We thought it would add a nice
little bit of extra kitsch value.

127
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:04,154
Right.

128
00:06:04,265 --> 00:06:06,767
- See, that does annoy me a little bit.
- Why?

129
00:06:06,822 --> 00:06:09,242
If you're looking for a podgy fellow,
who'd do anything to get on the telly...

130
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:10,404
Barry!

131
00:06:10,528 --> 00:06:12,505
You were trying to get him
<i>my</i> part a minute ago!

132
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:13,978
But he's versatile,
he's multitalented.

133
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:15,906
You never even saw his one-man version
of Romeo and Juliet!

134
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,413
Do a bit for him, will you?

135
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:21,546
O, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

136
00:06:21,684 --> 00:06:24,241
What satisfaction
canst thou have to-night?

137
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,755
The exchange of
thy love's faithful vow for mine.

138
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:32,432
I gave thee mine
before thou didst request it:

139
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:35,238
And yet I would it were to give...

140
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:36,897
again.

141
00:06:41,612 --> 00:06:43,327
It always gets me a bit.

142
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:53,530
Maggie.

143
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,871
Hello.

144
00:06:57,235 --> 00:06:59,391
You're not still an extra, are you?

145
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,336
God that must do your head in.
You know, I'm an actress now.

146
00:07:02,392 --> 00:07:04,259
- How long have you been an extra?
-Supporting artist.

147
00:07:04,328 --> 00:07:06,636
- How long have you been doing that?
- Well... about 18 months.

148
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:09,526
Got my nose plucked out of the cesspool.
No disrespect.

149
00:07:09,582 --> 00:07:10,798
None taken.

150
00:07:10,895 --> 00:07:12,734
I've got a scene acting
with Orlando Bloom?

151
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:15,015
- He's gorgeous.
- Well...

152
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:16,522
I just did a scene with him.

153
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:19,785
No, but... I mean,
not an actual scene with dialogue.

154
00:07:19,882 --> 00:07:21,955
You were just a fuzzy bloke
in the background.

155
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:24,264
- No disrespect.
- None taken. Again.

156
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,052
Hang on.

157
00:07:25,148 --> 00:07:27,886
Oh, it's Matty Bauer.
I've just got to take this.

158
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:29,143
Hello, darling.

159
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:35,282
Listen.

160
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:38,586
Look, Matt, can I just call you back?
Sorry, I'm just with a friend.

161
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:40,798
Yes, she is female.

162
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,101
He says,
can I take a picture of you?

163
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:45,733
Hold on a sec.

164
00:07:48,498 --> 00:07:51,069
I'll text it to you.
You're a dirty old man.

165
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,133
Bye.

166
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,173
He's not old. He's 28 and
he's got his own yacht. So...

167
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:58,064
He's quite a catch.

168
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:00,829
So, where are you living at the moment?
Have you got your own place?

169
00:08:00,884 --> 00:08:02,252
Yes, I've got my own place.

170
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:03,835
'Cause you were renting before.

171
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,503
That grotty little council place
behind Londis.

172
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,544
- I'm still there.
- You're well, though.

173
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,523
- Surprisingly.
- Well, that's the main thing.

174
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,053
Even if you've got nothing else,
at least you've got your health, eh?

175
00:08:15,192 --> 00:08:17,182
- At the moment.
- Yeah.

176
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,348
Talking of bad luck,
did you hear about Barbra?

177
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,312
Trev has left her
for a younger model.

178
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,455
She is devastated.

179
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:26,086
Honestly, all alone.

180
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:28,782
Crying herself to sleep every night
in that big house.

181
00:08:28,893 --> 00:08:31,712
She has got her own house,
at least, which is something.

182
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:33,122
Good for her.

183
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,473
Oh, that'd be Matsy.

184
00:08:38,942 --> 00:08:39,840
No.

185
00:08:40,822 --> 00:08:42,315
Nevermind.

186
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:47,085
Oh, he's late again. Alfie's gonna
be in so much trouble.

187
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,325
Well, I'm not carrying the can
for him again.

188
00:08:49,422 --> 00:08:51,412
He's no excuses this time.

189
00:08:51,482 --> 00:08:53,472
Mr Stoke said if he's late
one more time,

190
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:55,539
he's gonna give him
the brush off.

191
00:08:57,142 --> 00:08:59,078
Oh, here he is.

192
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:02,022
Alfie, not again!
Why are you late?

193
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,580
Because I buried
my sister today.

194
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:07,636
Yep, great.
Let's move on, next scene.

195
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:10,233
Sorry, I don't want to interfere.
Is that how he's gonna do it?

196
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:12,660
Cause it's gotta be a sad line,
"I buried my sister today".

197
00:09:12,743 --> 00:09:15,052
He was smiling.
It's gotta be an emotional...

198
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:15,964
Hang on, everyone.

199
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:19,890
Sorry Keith, can we try that again?
You were smiling, mate. It's...

200
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:22,213
They all sort of think you're a joke
'cause you're always late,

201
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:24,632
but today you've got a valid reason,
you buried your sister.

202
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:27,355
It's sort of like a...
It's like an emotional point.

203
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,042
Could we do it again?

204
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:32,166
- Yeah, no worries.
- Okay. Sorry.

205
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:36,770
You're smiling again.

206
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:39,659
You mustn't smile,
you're sad.

207
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:42,258
Okay?
You've just been to a funeral.

208
00:09:43,364 --> 00:09:44,927
Okay, in you come.

209
00:09:47,872 --> 00:09:51,895
Alfie, not again!
Why are you late?

210
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,319
Because...

211
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,821
I buried my sister today.

212
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:57,286
Don't look at the camera.

213
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,305
You can't,
mustn't look at the camera.

214
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:02,706
Ok? It sort of breaks.
This is real life.

215
00:10:02,788 --> 00:10:04,821
- Alright.
- Go again.

216
00:10:06,341 --> 00:10:08,636
Okay, in you come, action.

217
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:11,387
You're smiling. Sad.

218
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,211
You look straight
at the lense again.

219
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,423
Good, double one, mate.
On again.

220
00:10:16,335 --> 00:10:17,663
Action.

221
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:22,676
Alfie, not again!
Why are you late?

222
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:26,312
We can't see you, Keith!
You've gone too far, okay?

223
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:30,169
You've got to stay on that blue mark.
That's for you to stand on.

224
00:10:30,252 --> 00:10:31,868
'Cause that's
where the camera...

225
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:34,330
is pointing and
then we can see your face.

226
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:36,666
So, just to recap.
Come in, not smiling,

227
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,740
'cause you're sad,
you just buried your sister.

228
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:41,228
Don't look at the camera
and stand on that mark.

229
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:44,920
So we can see you
on the telly. Okay?

230
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,726
- There is a lot to remember, eh?
- There is a lot to remember.

231
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:50,463
It's called acting.

232
00:10:51,804 --> 00:10:52,965
Action.

233
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:55,108
Sad!

234
00:10:55,606 --> 00:10:57,375
Too far. Left a bit.

235
00:10:57,513 --> 00:10:59,655
Don't look at me?
Look at her asking the question.

236
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:02,268
- Why are you late?
- Because my sister buried me today.

237
00:11:02,338 --> 00:11:05,020
Oh, for fuck's sake,
why would your sister bury you?

238
00:11:05,102 --> 00:11:06,803
That'd be mental!

239
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,056
Sorry, I got sort of confused.

240
00:11:09,388 --> 00:11:12,043
- Thing is, my sister's not dead.
- What?

241
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:14,670
I told'em when I started.
My sister.

242
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:16,688
She's not dead.

243
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,831
Do you mean,
in your real life?

244
00:11:19,342 --> 00:11:20,338
Yeah.

245
00:11:21,858 --> 00:11:24,208
Presume you didn't work
in a factory all your life.

246
00:11:24,305 --> 00:11:26,116
- No.
- And your name is not Alfie.

247
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:29,399
Yeah. That's another thing.
Sometimes...

248
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:32,068
I don't know
who's talking to who.

249
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:36,297
Would you rather
be called Keith in this?

250
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:38,288
It would help.

251
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,431
Okay everyone, we're changing Keith's
character name from Alfie to Keith.

252
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:45,857
Ok good, let's go again.

253
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:48,719
This time, then.

254
00:11:49,673 --> 00:11:51,111
In you come, Keith.

255
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:54,698
- Keith me or Keith the character?
- Same person!

256
00:11:56,043 --> 00:11:58,864
Keith, you and Keith the character.
Only one Keith, okay? In you come.

257
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,014
Action!

258
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,841
- The door's stuck.
- That's lunch!

259
00:12:07,037 --> 00:12:09,725
Okay. No, okay. Bye.

260
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:14,105
Yeah, sister called to do
a small part in a film,

261
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:16,162
I had to let them down,
I'm too busy.

262
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,868
- Oh, I wonder if they'd want you?
- No, I wouldn't have thought so.

263
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:21,693
Hang on,
let me give them a call.

264
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:24,832
Try and help my bloody mate.
You need the help.

265
00:12:26,505 --> 00:12:28,842
Hiya Pauline,
about that job...

266
00:12:28,925 --> 00:12:31,012
I've got a friend
who's available.

267
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:33,376
Does she have to be
good looking?

268
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:35,105
Does she?

269
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:39,764
I don't know,
late thirties, early fourties?

270
00:12:40,082 --> 00:12:42,667
I'd say... mousy. But...

271
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:45,625
But lovely girl.
Great personality.

272
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,353
Desperate for anything.

273
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,223
No? Alright, well, I tried.

274
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:52,993
Okay, cheers.

275
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:54,832
Sorry about that.

276
00:12:54,928 --> 00:12:56,891
It's not your lucky day.

277
00:13:00,735 --> 00:13:02,616
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

278
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:20,656
I'm back again.

279
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,010
Fourteen years I did here
at the BBC.

280
00:13:25,397 --> 00:13:26,932
Swap Shop.

281
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:30,180
Cheggers Plays Pop, all sorts.

282
00:13:31,535 --> 00:13:33,885
Still run by jews
and queers, is it?

283
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,526
- It's... what?
- This place.

284
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:39,622
It's still run by jews
and queers.

285
00:13:42,895 --> 00:13:44,803
I think there are
some jews people.

286
00:13:44,997 --> 00:13:46,794
And some gay people, yeah.

287
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,660
"Gay".

288
00:13:48,978 --> 00:13:50,264
Ethical.

289
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,365
Not meant to say "queer", are you?

290
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,881
Suggests something abnormal.

291
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,066
What could be more normal than
shoving your cock up a bloke's arse?

292
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,122
I put it this way:

293
00:14:03,287 --> 00:14:05,638
if God had wanted a cock up an arse,

294
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:07,877
he wouldn't have given us minges.

295
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,168
Men have knobs.

296
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:13,919
Women have fannies.

297
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:17,321
Pop, knob in fanny.

298
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,962
Not up the arse.

299
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:22,547
Good.

300
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,994
That's me making notes.

301
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:27,731
- You want?
- No, thanks.

302
00:14:27,855 --> 00:14:29,832
It's all good advice.

303
00:14:42,763 --> 00:14:44,850
- Hiya.
- Hello again.

304
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:45,942
What're you reading?

305
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,739
Oh, just... "Hello".

306
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:49,302
Oh, yeah. "Heat".

307
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:56,216
- Oh, no. I can't believe it.
- What is it?

308
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,608
I just topped 5 Sexiest Film Stars,
for God's sake.

309
00:14:58,677 --> 00:15:00,447
- You in it?
- Number one.

310
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:03,779
It's stupid.
What do they mean, these lists?

311
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:04,664
Nothing, really.

312
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:06,807
Don't slag'em off,
it's their opinion.

313
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:08,880
Oh, no, look at this.

314
00:15:08,977 --> 00:15:11,092
Women magazine.

315
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,314
"I'm having an affair
with my brother-in-law's ghost"?

316
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:17,618
No, that, Women's Top 10 Fancy Snogs.
Number one again.

317
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:19,803
What was that thing
about a ghost?

318
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:23,798
"My husband's brother ghost visits me
and I think I'm falling in love with him."

319
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:25,547
Do they have sex?

320
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:30,165
It doesn't say.
It doesn't matter, look.

321
00:15:30,234 --> 00:15:32,364
We were looking at the number one
fancy snog for women.

322
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,423
Number one,
Orlando Bloom.

323
00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:37,659
I'm not gonna show this to Johnny Depp,
he's only number four.

324
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:40,009
Really?
He'd be <i>my</i> number one.

325
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:42,539
You want number one?
There's the proof.

326
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:45,803
It was the same on the set
of Pirates of the Caribbean.

327
00:15:45,872 --> 00:15:48,360
Me and Keira doing a kissing scene,
I do a brilliant take,

328
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:51,332
everyone claps, the director
goes: "That was amazing".

329
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:54,525
Keira goes: "Oh, can we just do
that kissing bit again?"

330
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:56,364
I know what she's up to.

331
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:57,884
And I teese her and I go:

332
00:15:57,967 --> 00:16:00,303
"If you wanna kiss somebody,
why don't you kiss Johnny Depp."

333
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:03,704
She goes: "Don't make me fucking sick,
I'm gonna vomit if you carry on like that."

334
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:06,069
Why do you keep talking
about Johnny Depp?

335
00:16:06,152 --> 00:16:07,368
I don't keep talking about him.

336
00:16:07,437 --> 00:16:09,580
I never talk about him.
He's boring, he's a prat.

337
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,945
Weren't for me, he wouldn't last five minutes,
he'd get smacked straight away.

338
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,926
Where are you from?

339
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:15,663
Beyond the Wold,
near Royal Windsor.

340
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,981
But they're all subjective though,
those lists, aren't they?

341
00:16:19,064 --> 00:16:21,718
Well no, obviously I am
objectively really good-looking.

342
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:23,446
It's not objective, is it?

343
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:27,151
Personally, I think
you're a wee bit...

344
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:29,847
What's that?
You're warming me up?

345
00:16:30,138 --> 00:16:31,410
Let's have a drink later.

346
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:32,751
I can't, I'm meeting my friend.

347
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,056
Come out for a coffee with me.

348
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:36,760
Just get to know me.
Get to know the normal me.

349
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:39,597
Take a better look at me,
you know, see the attractiveness.

350
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,629
I don't think you are.

351
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,622
Liar.

352
00:16:55,157 --> 00:16:56,415
Try them on.

353
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,515
- A bit whacking, aren't they?
- Big glasses are funny.

354
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,307
- Real Ray didn't even wear glasses.
- Put'em on!

355
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:07,947
That's funny.
Do the catch phrase.

356
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:11,059
It's not a catch phrase, it's
something he actually used to say.

357
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:13,229
"You're having a laugh?
Is he having a laugh?"

358
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,779
Now the wig.

359
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:18,728
How about that one?

360
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,520
- It looks ridiculous.
- That looks funny.

361
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:23,110
He didn't even have curly hair.

362
00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:25,716
- Curly is funny.
- What do you mean, curly is funny?

363
00:17:25,785 --> 00:17:27,596
Curly hair. It's funny!

364
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:30,257
Harpo Marks,
Leo Sayer.

365
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,572
Loads of people are curly
and they aren't funny.

366
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,967
Starsky from "Starksy and Hutch".
Jim Morrison.

367
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,379
- Blacks.
- Don't say "blacks".

368
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,587
- What shall I say?
- Say "black people".

369
00:17:42,057 --> 00:17:42,818
Okay.

370
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:44,408
Black people aren't funny.

371
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:45,928
Black people <i>are</i> funny, Keith.

372
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,574
Name one black person
that's funny.

373
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:49,523
I can name you loads
of funny black persons.

374
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,735
Dave Chappelle,
Chris Rock, Eddie Murphy.

375
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:52,910
English.

376
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,072
Don't change the rules
half way through.

377
00:17:57,555 --> 00:18:00,721
There are loads of funny
english black people, too.

378
00:18:00,818 --> 00:18:01,758
Who?

379
00:18:25,928 --> 00:18:28,251
- Good news.
- Oh, more good news, excellent!

380
00:18:28,431 --> 00:18:31,845
Right. Eddie Osbourne.
Electrician.

381
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:34,748
He splat with his wife a while ago
and he's back on the market.

382
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,574
Lovely guy.
Just your type.

383
00:18:36,684 --> 00:18:38,993
- Really?
- Sweet guy. Lovely guy.

384
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,306
Interested?

385
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:41,772
Yeah.

386
00:18:42,532 --> 00:18:44,578
Great. Eddie?

387
00:18:44,827 --> 00:18:45,850
Yo!

388
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,694
This is her.

389
00:18:53,392 --> 00:18:54,388
No.

390
00:18:55,151 --> 00:18:57,598
- Nevermind.
- He's not bothered.

391
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,197
I just don't know
where you're going wrong.

392
00:19:01,372 --> 00:19:03,459
Right. Kiss me.

393
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,492
- One kiss. Come on.
- No!

394
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,331
One kiss. Just let me
show you how I do it.

395
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,903
- No tongues if you don't want.
- If it's gonna shut you up.

396
00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:21,266
- Well?
- Not really my cup of tea.

397
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,296
Sorry about that.

398
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,492
You're in this club.

399
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:43,008
This vision walks over.

400
00:19:43,188 --> 00:19:46,160
She says "Hi, handsome.
Wanna buy me a drink?"

401
00:19:46,229 --> 00:19:48,455
- What do you say?
- I say I'm not made of money.

402
00:19:48,593 --> 00:19:50,473
Oh, you're never gonna get
a woman like that.

403
00:19:50,543 --> 00:19:52,547
I don't want
a woman like that!

404
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,745
Go and be nice to her.

405
00:19:54,828 --> 00:19:56,736
Caress her hair.

406
00:19:58,021 --> 00:20:00,192
No, don't pat it,
she's not a dog!

407
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:02,196
She must be a dog
if she's going out with him.

408
00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:04,823
Oh, Mr Stokes.

409
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:06,648
Sorry.

410
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:15,440
Maybe waggle the glasses.

411
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:17,597
- I'm not sure about the glasses.
- We gotta have the glasses.

412
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,131
- It's hysterical!
- I don't think so.

413
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:20,998
It's definitely funnier
with the glasses.

414
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:23,362
- Yeah, it is, I agree.
- There's a surprise.

415
00:20:23,527 --> 00:20:26,914
I'm sorry if my presence here
as head of comedy irritates you,

416
00:20:26,984 --> 00:20:28,905
but I've been in this business
a lot longer than you,

417
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:31,671
and my opinion wil be heard
because I'm the man with the money.

418
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:32,956
It's not your money.

419
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,039
No, but I'm entrusted to make sure
that it's spent correctly.

420
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:39,316
Oh, we'll make sure it's spent correctly,
which is apparently on funny glasses.

421
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:41,694
- Just five...
- Yes.

422
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,496
Oh, do you mind if I take these
for later on?

423
00:20:49,104 --> 00:20:51,772
Can I just say that,
I know what you're going through.

424
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:55,504
My character on "Eastenders" was
an interesting three-dimensional person.

425
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,620
But then over the years,
the writers turned him into a joke

426
00:20:57,703 --> 00:21:00,634
and that's why I walked away,
it wasn't what I wanted to do.

427
00:21:00,744 --> 00:21:03,938
And I know some people
look at me know, say I was a fool.

428
00:21:04,028 --> 00:21:07,539
But I know I walked away
with my intergrity and my pride intact.

429
00:21:08,216 --> 00:21:11,271
You know, I just think
you gotta do what you think it's right.

430
00:21:16,857 --> 00:21:19,276
- Iain. Can I have a word?
- Yeah, what is it?

431
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,612
This isn't the comedy
I signed up to make, okay?

432
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:23,368
In fact, I think it's awful.

433
00:21:23,437 --> 00:21:25,967
Shall we not do this here?
Shall we go up to my office--

434
00:21:26,022 --> 00:21:28,483
No, I don't care who hears
what I've got to say,

435
00:21:28,566 --> 00:21:31,207
because I'm at that point now.
Everyone has interfered,

436
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:32,215
It's embarrassing.

437
00:21:32,284 --> 00:21:34,938
I don't want go on television
and be famous for the sake of it.

438
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:37,192
I want to do something
that I'm proud of.

439
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,459
And I won't be proud of...

440
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:43,137
shouting out catch phrases
in a stupid wig and funny glasses.

441
00:21:43,206 --> 00:21:44,505
I wanna do what <i>I</i> wanna do,

442
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:46,593
otherwise I'll hate myself
for the rest of my life.

443
00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:48,508
And I'll tell you what,
a case in point:

444
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,306
Shaun.
On "Eastenders",

445
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:52,525
they started to turn
his character into a joke.

446
00:21:52,621 --> 00:21:55,193
And he walked away,
at the top of his game.

447
00:21:55,345 --> 00:21:56,672
That's called integrity.

448
00:21:56,769 --> 00:21:59,188
Okay? It doesn't matter
what happens to him now.

449
00:21:59,313 --> 00:22:01,013
'Cause he's got his dignity.

450
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,619
- Shaun, are you...
- Leave it.

451
00:22:31,806 --> 00:22:34,723
So basically, I'm not gonna
prostitute myself anymore,

452
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:36,396
or my work. Okay?

453
00:22:36,474 --> 00:22:38,469
I'm just sick of people
coming along, telling me...

454
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:39,821
how they think
it should be done.

455
00:22:39,863 --> 00:22:41,718
And me just having to bend over
and take up the arse.

456
00:22:42,732 --> 00:22:44,993
Shall I just say, no disrespect
to either of you...

457
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,182
as gays...

458
00:22:46,285 --> 00:22:48,649
We don't know
if you're givers or receivers,

459
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:50,378
very difficult to tell
just from looking at you.

460
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:52,355
Although if I was putting money
on that, it'd probably go...

461
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:53,902
Anyway, I...

462
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,727
You've heard
what I've got say.

463
00:23:03,972 --> 00:23:06,588
Right. Well, thanks for
telling us how you feel.

464
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,248
So, here's how I see
things going forward.

465
00:23:12,317 --> 00:23:14,874
You can either carry on and record
this show as we've already planned,

466
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:18,344
or you can pull the plug,
waste everybody's time and hard work,

467
00:23:18,455 --> 00:23:20,998
waste the thousands of pounds
we've already spent so far,

468
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:24,081
burn all your bridges with the BBC,
you can go back to being an extra,

469
00:23:24,192 --> 00:23:26,998
and then you can work
your way back up again from nothing.

470
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:29,031
What do you wanna do?

471
00:23:39,838 --> 00:23:42,742
- Well, what're you gonna do?
- Sitcom.

472
00:23:43,143 --> 00:23:45,949
This... This can be good.

473
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:47,981
That's what I've been trying to say.

474
00:23:48,106 --> 00:23:50,857
Finish this off,
'cause it can...

475
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:52,377
I don't wanna let people down.

476
00:23:52,488 --> 00:23:54,603
I wanna get on with this
and get this on the telly.

477
00:23:54,686 --> 00:23:57,492
And then in the future, might be
look up doing the way I wanna do it...

478
00:23:57,589 --> 00:23:59,732
- Or not.
- Or not. See how it goes.

479
00:23:59,863 --> 00:24:01,301
That's all I wanna...

480
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,149
- Okay.
- Good.

481
00:24:09,518 --> 00:24:10,458
- Andy.
- Yeah?

482
00:24:10,527 --> 00:24:12,559
- Don't forget your--
- Glasses.

483
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,168
- Cutting a bit fine aren't you?
- I know, I'm sorry I'm late.

484
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:34,477
- Everything alright?
- Yeah.

485
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,565
- Your first night nerves?
- No, no.

486
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:40,062
Actually I had to kick a bit of arse
'cause I was getting sick of all this.

487
00:24:40,118 --> 00:24:42,441
Is it a good comedy,
is it a bad comedy...

488
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:44,639
Is a good comedy
if it pleases people?

489
00:24:44,736 --> 00:24:46,215
Can we get on with it?
You know what I mean?

490
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:49,381
A comedy has to be as broad
as possible so you take everyone in.

491
00:24:49,464 --> 00:24:52,091
I want the whole families to like this.
I want the four-years-old to like this.

492
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,944
- They will.
- D'you know what I mean?

493
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:57,318
And if doesn't stands the test of time,
so what, do something else, but...

494
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:01,396
You know... Bring as much joy
into the world as you can.

495
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,686
Well, as long as you're happy.

496
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:07,424
I'm happy if people are happy.

497
00:25:10,313 --> 00:25:12,234
- Are you definitely ready for this?
- Yeah.

498
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,501
- You're definitely gonna...
- Yes.

499
00:25:16,493 --> 00:25:18,055
Forget about it,
he's gonna do it, mate.

500
00:25:18,152 --> 00:25:20,544
- Fuck!
- I know, I'm as annoyed as you are.

501
00:25:30,225 --> 00:25:33,073
Bloody hell, Rita,
you look terrible.

502
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,160
Life as a single mum
getting to you?

503
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:39,502
I was up til 2 a.m. doing
me daughter's science homework.

504
00:25:39,598 --> 00:25:43,137
Did you know that Alexander Flemming
discovered penicillin

505
00:25:43,206 --> 00:25:45,985
when he found mold
on some old bread he'd left out?

506
00:25:46,095 --> 00:25:47,865
He should look
under Gobbler's bed,

507
00:25:47,962 --> 00:25:50,201
find a new species.

508
00:25:50,824 --> 00:25:54,072
He'd find a new species
if he looked <i>in</i> Gobbler's bed.

509
00:25:55,814 --> 00:25:57,114
I don't get it.

510
00:25:58,206 --> 00:25:59,810
<i>You</i> don't get it.

511
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,896
I've been
without a man so long,

512
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:04,537
I'd think I'd say yes
if <i>Ray</i> asked me out.

513
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:06,037
My, is it burning?

514
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:09,010
Maybe I can last
a few more years.

515
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,885
Morning, campers.

516
00:26:11,983 --> 00:26:13,759
Congratulations are in order.

517
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,427
You all succesfully
clocked in on time, this morning.

518
00:26:16,524 --> 00:26:18,363
You just forgot
to start bloody work!

519
00:26:20,202 --> 00:26:22,331
Steady on, Mr Stokes.

520
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,391
We've been comforting Rita.

521
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,695
She's been up all night, trying to get
her head around some fella called Alexander.

522
00:26:29,118 --> 00:26:30,348
Lucky beggar.

523
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:32,367
No one that works here, I hope.

524
00:26:32,622 --> 00:26:33,770
No, he's dead.

525
00:26:34,378 --> 00:26:35,858
You cook for him, as well!

526
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:41,139
Oh, Mr Stokes,
will you be nice to her?

527
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,301
Well, Rita,
I know you had your problems,

528
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:49,269
but I want you to know this:
the door to my office is always open.

529
00:26:49,573 --> 00:26:51,328
Thank you, Mr Stokes.

530
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:54,204
I think it's the bloody hinges.
Get up your ass and fix it, will you?

531
00:26:55,933 --> 00:26:58,532
- I haven't got any tools.
- You're joking?

532
00:26:58,629 --> 00:27:01,448
You've got two right here.
Gobbler is a complete spanner.

533
00:27:02,637 --> 00:27:03,882
I don't get it.

534
00:27:04,795 --> 00:27:09,108
What Mr Stokes has cleverly done
with recourse to upon...

535
00:27:09,205 --> 00:27:12,537
is take Rita's usage
of the word "tool"...

536
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:16,588
a device that performs manual
or mechanical work,

537
00:27:16,643 --> 00:27:22,324
and transposed its meaning into
the vulgar slang definition of "tool".

538
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:25,767
Meaning the male
reproductive appendage.

539
00:27:26,707 --> 00:27:28,297
Are you having a laugh?

540
00:27:28,407 --> 00:27:30,039
Is he having a laugh?

541
00:27:33,744 --> 00:27:35,389
You're having a laugh!

542
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,260
He is having a laugh!

543
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:58,139
You're having a laugh.

544
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:06,274
Oh, I got a letter back
from the dating agency.

545
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:09,233
Yet this guy replied,
sent me a picture.

546
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:12,032
Before you ask,
it was taken on his allotment

547
00:28:12,115 --> 00:28:14,811
and yes,
he did win the first prize.

548
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:31,154
