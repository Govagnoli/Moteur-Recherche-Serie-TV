1
00:00:05,517 --> 00:00:07,019
Horatio.

2
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:09,240
Emma. What are you doing here?

3
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:11,949
I couldn't bear to let you go
without saying goodbye.

4
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:14,367
You shouldn't have come, Emma.
People will talk.

5
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:18,382
Let them talk.
I'm tired of hiding our love away.

6
00:00:18,462 --> 00:00:21,320
- I'm not ashamed of how I feel.
- Neither am I.

7
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:23,502
But we both know we shouldn't be together.

8
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:27,075
- Shouldn't? Who says we shouldn't?
- My conscience.

9
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:31,279
My conscience tells me
everything I feel for you is wrong.

10
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:35,449
But my heart, my heart says...

11
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:37,911
I can't live without you.

12
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:41,690
- Promise me you'll return.
- I promise.

13
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:44,505
Because if Napoleon doesn't kill me,

14
00:00:44,592 --> 00:00:47,765
then being away from you surely will.

15
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:59,557
Cut! Yeah, brilliant, thank you.

16
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:03,212
- Could you see me?
- Yeah, definitely.

17
00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:06,818
Excellent. We'll get out
before that fat little extra gets his face in.

18
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,788
Okay.

19
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:15,558
DIRECTOR: Rest the guys for 10 minutes.

20
00:01:15,645 --> 00:01:18,536
That's correct. Yeah, great.

21
00:01:18,623 --> 00:01:20,407
We're moving on to 37.

22
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:33,989
Hey. Who are we using
for the girl by the carriage?

23
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,888
We thought this one.

24
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:40,618
No, I said I needed some decent tits
and they're... rubbish.

25
00:01:42,449 --> 00:01:46,413
Well, I could maybe pad them up a bit.
Or just sort of, like, push them...

26
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:48,678
- You could use these.
- Bingo.

27
00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:51,857
Bingo these in half an hour
after I've had a wee fiddle with them.

28
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:55,351
- I just need to squeeze them.
- Well, work on them over lunch, yeah?

29
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:58,608
Because at the moment
they're just, urgh, nothing.

30
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,791
- Okay.
- Good.

31
00:02:00,874 --> 00:02:02,692
Would it be easier just to use these?

32
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,264
We made a decision to use mine, so can we
just go with these? If I just squeeze them...

33
00:02:07,347 --> 00:02:09,165
It would be less work.

34
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:12,776
You've got padding at the bottom of them.
Can I get some padding?

35
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,615
MAGGIE: This cow's like,
she's like sticking her tits in his face

36
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:22,464
and I'm saying, "He said he wanted to use
my tits. Can we just go with my tits, please?"

37
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:24,498
I think Meryl Streep
went through a similar thing.

38
00:02:24,581 --> 00:02:27,551
- I know it's not important but...
- It is important.

39
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:30,259
I remember Laurence Olivier
having a rant in Richard III

40
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:32,914
because they wanted to use
stunt testicles and he said,

41
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:36,173
"Listen, these gonads are going to be seen
because they went to RADA.

42
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,068
"You either use the Lord Olivier plums
or nothing at all."

43
00:02:39,155 --> 00:02:40,498
Next.

44
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:43,317
Ahh... And what do you recommend,
my good man?

45
00:02:44,912 --> 00:02:47,803
- Chicken's the warmest.
- Is it? I'll have that, then.

46
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,388
Chicken.

47
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,734
Your heart's not in this, is it?

48
00:02:57,818 --> 00:03:00,393
Although one of your pubes is, I see.

49
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:05,552
- Straight in there like that, no messing.
- It's not a pube, it's a dog hair.

50
00:03:05,641 --> 00:03:08,453
It's all right, it's not a pube,
it's a dog hair, everyone.

51
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,115
I thought it was a pube.
It's not, it's just a dog hair.

52
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,560
If you do get a hair in there, he just
gets it out with his big sausage fingers.

53
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:20,330
- I don't know why I do this.
- What?

54
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:24,174
All this. "Oh, we'll cut before
the fat bloke gets his face in shot."

55
00:03:24,265 --> 00:03:27,754
It's just absolutely demeaning.
I don't know why I put myself through it.

56
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:30,053
- Because you're an actor.
- This isn't acting.

57
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:32,514
Getting the back of your head
or your arm in a shot.

58
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:35,778
And bloody Ross Kemp in every scene,
he gets all the lines.

59
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,198
Do you know what I mean?
Why is he the star and not me?

60
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:40,733
There but for the grace of God go I.
And it's just... What?

61
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:42,371
- It's not quite.
- Well, it is.

62
00:03:42,452 --> 00:03:44,033
It's not just luck, is it?

63
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,853
- Why not? We're about the same age...
- No, he's younger than you.

64
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:49,074
- No, he's not. We're about the same age.
- Is he?

65
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:51,783
- Yeah.
- He looks a lot younger than you.

66
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:53,964
You're having a laugh.
He hasn't got any hair.

67
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:56,667
He's meant to look like that.
He's shaved it all off.

68
00:03:56,748 --> 00:03:58,882
It's like cool, it's like Vin Diesel.

69
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:01,264
Vin Diesel?
Sorry, are we looking at the same bloke?

70
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:06,188
Have another look, right. Look at him there.
He looks more like Zippy from Rainbow.

71
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:07,587
(MIMICKING ZIPPY) Hello!

72
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:11,474
Bungle, what are you doing
in the Queen Vic, Bungle?

73
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:15,286
Phil, why did you sleep with my wife?
Look, look.

74
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:19,183
Vin Diesel hasn't got
a perfectly round little head

75
00:04:19,263 --> 00:04:21,713
that opens and shuts like Pac-Man, look at it.

76
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:25,258
- He's got less chins than you as well.
- One chin, one chin each.

77
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:28,038
- Yeah, but yours is growing another one.
- Shut up.

78
00:04:28,118 --> 00:04:30,569
In five years' time,
he's still going to look pretty rugged

79
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,821
- and you're just going to look like a pelican.
- A pelican? Good, nice one.

80
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:39,744
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

81
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,380
Well, obviously him.

82
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:43,562
- Husband material?
- Could be.

83
00:04:43,645 --> 00:04:46,773
- What are you basing it on this time?
- Don't know but look at him.

84
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:49,674
He's all dashing and handsome in his green.

85
00:04:50,078 --> 00:04:53,015
Why do men not dress like that nowadays?

86
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:55,512
Because they'd get beaten up on the Tube.

87
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:12,112
- All right?
- All right, Greg.

88
00:05:12,832 --> 00:05:14,616
- Indeed I am.
- Good.

89
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:18,657
I'm actually working across the way,
Studio H, the big one.

90
00:05:18,749 --> 00:05:21,606
Doing a film with Mr Vinnie Jones.

91
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:25,335
So, actually, just learning a few lines
I've got to do with him later.

92
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,554
- Lines?
- Yes, indeed.

93
00:05:27,922 --> 00:05:29,265
Well done.

94
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:31,643
So what's your part in this epic, then?

95
00:05:31,734 --> 00:05:33,710
The fourth seaman from the left or...

96
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,267
Hardly.

97
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:38,362
You got something a bit more...
Bit meatier, bit more substantial.

98
00:05:38,445 --> 00:05:41,415
You got a speaking part or a... No?

99
00:05:41,502 --> 00:05:42,688
Not in this one, no.

100
00:05:42,773 --> 00:05:45,630
- Seriously, how do you survive?
- Don't worry about it, really.

101
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,331
- Digging into the savings?
- Not really.

102
00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:51,269
The pile diminishes, does it?
Gotta get some work soon.

103
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,688
- Gotta get some work soon.
- Working all the time, mate.

104
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:55,590
- Don't worry about it.
- Sort of.

105
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,779
Are your parents still sending you money?

106
00:05:57,863 --> 00:06:01,386
Well, yeah. Either that or I,
you know, threaten to sign on.

107
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:04,842
And lo! The cheque doth cometh in the post.

108
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,873
- It keeps the wolf from the door.
- Good.

109
00:06:06,956 --> 00:06:09,610
How is the door of the house
your parents bought you, is that all right?

110
00:06:09,696 --> 00:06:11,039
- Yes, it's fine.
- Good.

111
00:06:11,126 --> 00:06:14,220
- Look, I've got lines to learn.
- Thanks for coming over and sharing that.

112
00:06:14,303 --> 00:06:17,002
- Seriously, mate, something will crop up.
- Don't worry about it.

113
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:18,900
Don't worry about it, mate.
Worry about yourself.

114
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:20,174
- Stiff upper lip.
- Yes.

115
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:23,467
- And other clichés too numerous to mention.
- Don't mention them then.

116
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:25,814
- See you later, mate.
- Cheers, mate.

117
00:06:25,898 --> 00:06:27,716
Tosser. Not you.

118
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:57,381
Excuse me. Do you mind
if I go in front of you, please?

119
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:59,602
- What?
- Can I go before you?

120
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:02,424
- Why?
- I've got a little bit of a stomach upset.

121
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,899
Oh, okay.

122
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:10,447
- Hello.
- Hi.

123
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:13,502
I think she wants to go in front of you,
she's got diarrhoea.

124
00:07:14,265 --> 00:07:17,280
Don't want it exploding everywhere. Messy.

125
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:20,691
Thank you.

126
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:37,014
Saw you looking.

127
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:39,312
Thought I'd better get it out of the way.

128
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:42,691
Yeah, it is me.

129
00:07:43,372 --> 00:07:44,761
Hi, I'm Andy.

130
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:47,064
- How you doing?
- Oh!

131
00:07:47,144 --> 00:07:48,770
- Sorry, did that hurt?
- No...

132
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:52,782
Good. I was worried I might have hurt you.
Don't know my own strength sometimes.

133
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:56,713
If I had meant to hurt you, you wouldn't
have any ribs left so you got off lightly.

134
00:07:56,794 --> 00:07:59,210
- Let's leave it there.
- Okay.

135
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,817
You know, I love playing military parts.

136
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:07,312
Well, as you know, I was in the SAS.

137
00:08:07,952 --> 00:08:11,047
No. I knew you did that TV show
about the SAS.

138
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:14,852
Yeah, but how did I know
how to do all that shit in it?

139
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,672
I assumed you had consultants and stuff.

140
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:20,460
If that's what you believe,
then that's what you believe.

141
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,431
All right, I wasn't in the SAS
for six months and they didn't say,

142
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,732
"Ross, why don't you give up
this acting lark?

143
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:28,679
"We could really do with you
in Afghanistan."

144
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,386
- Did they?
- Couldn't say.

145
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,754
All I know is, if I do get into a fight,
I'd better have an escape route

146
00:08:33,843 --> 00:08:38,124
because I don't want to go to prison
for murder, because that's what it would be.

147
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:40,865
Because my body is a lethal weapon.

148
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:43,483
And me in prison, face like this.

149
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,033
Pretty boy.

150
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:49,330
I'd be in the shower just lathering up,

151
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:52,380
a couple of guys would come in
wanting a bit of Kemp arse.

152
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,444
I'd see them in the mirror and...

153
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,079
What I'm saying is,
you'd best not get into a fight with me.

154
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,063
Sure.

155
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:07,787
Or a conversation.

156
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:17,561
What do you do when you're not doing this?
What's your day job?

157
00:09:17,643 --> 00:09:19,620
I work in a pub.

158
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,882
- What about you?
- I do this full time. I'm an actor.

159
00:09:22,964 --> 00:09:25,302
- You do this full time?
- Yeah, yeah.

160
00:09:25,387 --> 00:09:27,126
Like most actors, I act full time.

161
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:30,545
Yeah, but this isn't really acting, is it?
I mean, this is extra work.

162
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:33,282
Well, no, supporting artist work, innit?

163
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:36,496
But it's just, this is just pocket money.
I am actually an actor.

164
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:40,030
Right. I was gonna say 'cause you can't
really make a living from being an extra.

165
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:41,260
No.

166
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,393
No, but he used to have a proper job.
He used to... He owns his own house.

167
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,530
Doesn't have to pay a mortgage
so he can afford to live on a pittance.

168
00:09:48,617 --> 00:09:51,587
I don't live on a pittance, though, do I?
People pay me to act so...

169
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,967
- Yeah, you say you're an actor.
- Yeah, I do.

170
00:09:54,057 --> 00:09:56,078
- But what have you actually acted in?
- I've appeared...

171
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,889
I mean proper acting, not walking in
the background. I mean, actually speaking.

172
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,549
- I know.
- Well?

173
00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:05,610
- What, you want me to...
- Yeah.

174
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:06,720
Okay.

175
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:10,368
- My Family, the Robert Lindsay sitcom.
- Really?

176
00:10:10,457 --> 00:10:13,507
Yeah, it was just a thing,
sort of a scene on the bus

177
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:15,412
and the bus conductor come along

178
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,515
and, "Tickets please," and I just went,
"Yeah, sure, no problem."

179
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:21,376
- Did you?
- Yes.

180
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:23,123
- That was the line?
- Yeah.

181
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:24,864
He comes along and goes, "Tickets please,"

182
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:26,611
and I go, "Yeah, no problem. Mate,
there you go."

183
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:29,240
So if I got that episode and watched it,
that's what I'd see you say,

184
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:31,420
- "Sure, no problem."
- Well, yeah.

185
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:33,525
(MUMBLES) "...there you go."

186
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:36,150
Well, I didn't... What was that?
What's the line?

187
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:38,330
- What's the problem?
- What is the line?

188
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:40,152
The conductor wants the ticket,
I'm showing him it.

189
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,979
And what do you say?

190
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:43,850
He asks for my ticket.

191
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:45,750
- Yeah.
- And I go...

192
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,882
I can't hear what you're saying.
No, let's do it like it is actually on the screen.

193
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:53,255
I'll be the bus driver, okay,
and you just be you, all right?

194
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:55,760
Tickets please, can I see your tickets please?

195
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,695
I can't hear anything.
No one can hear anything.

196
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,879
- It was years ago.
- But that's not proper acting.

197
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,140
- What is it, then?
- I can tell you what acting is.

198
00:11:04,224 --> 00:11:07,398
- I can tell you what I've acted in...
- Not interested.

199
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:10,892
I've acted in, and I'm talking proper
speaking parts, in Emmerdale,

200
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,522
- Silent Witness.
- Silent Witness?

201
00:11:12,603 --> 00:11:14,072
- Silent Witness.
- Shh!

202
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:17,874
I was a narc in The Bill,
that was a recurring character,

203
00:11:17,964 --> 00:11:21,172
that was three episodes
and really good lines of dialogue.

204
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,394
You haven't even been in The Bill, have you?

205
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:25,980
- I don't want to be in The Bill.
- You haven't even been in The Bill?

206
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:27,770
Listen, I don't want to be in The Bill.

207
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:30,031
- Have you ever been in Casualty?
- Yeah.

208
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:33,797
- The TV show Casualty?
- Well, no, but... No.

209
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:53,462
Right, this is the deal.

210
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:56,243
You've been my agent
now for, what, five years?

211
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:59,655
And you're not getting me
any real acting work.

212
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:02,517
- Nothing's coming in.
- Nothing's coming in. In five years?

213
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:04,699
That's the problem.
I'm as annoyed as you are.

214
00:12:04,782 --> 00:12:08,712
But I'm not sure there's a demand for,
you know, little 45-year-old blokes.

215
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:09,820
43.

216
00:12:09,905 --> 00:12:13,112
Whatever. You know, I wonder,
are you sure you want to be an actor?

217
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:17,368
You've given it five years, nothing's come in.
Maybe it's time to just throw in the towel.

218
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:20,622
My agent, ladies and gentlemen. My agent.

219
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:23,800
- Look... Hello, mate, all right?
- Sorry to interrupt.

220
00:12:23,882 --> 00:12:26,582
- That's all right. Do you know Barry?
- All right, Shaun. How's it going?

221
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,712
I'm working with a friend of yours
at the moment, Ross Kemp.

222
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,268
- How is he?
- Yeah, good.

223
00:12:31,348 --> 00:12:34,600
I wouldn't mention Ross' name round here.
Ross is sort of mud with Barry

224
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:37,936
because it was Ross that persuaded
Barry to leave EastEnders.

225
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:40,797
Ross leaves, he goes to ITV.
He says it's a million pounds or nothing.

226
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:42,380
They give him a million pound contract.

227
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:46,227
So I go with Barry and say we want a million
pounds or nothing, they chose nothing.

228
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:49,763
They went with the nothing option that time,
didn't they?

229
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:53,342
You were upset, weren't you? Depressed.
Couldn't get out of bed for two weeks.

230
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:55,324
I was livid and looking back,
what I should have done is,

231
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:58,382
I shouldn't have given them
the nothing option. I should have said,

232
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,440
"We want a million pounds or we want £500,"

233
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:03,233
and that way we'd have
definitely got something.

234
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:04,941
- £500?
- Exactly, this is it.

235
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:08,387
- But live and learn, don't you?
- This isn't living though, is it?

236
00:13:08,477 --> 00:13:11,130
Don't start that again.
I've got loads of stuff for you.

237
00:13:11,217 --> 00:13:12,402
Like what?

238
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:15,932
There's a light flickering in the gents.
Could you have a tinker with that?

239
00:13:16,022 --> 00:13:17,681
Yeah, I could do that.

240
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:21,214
Could I use your computer later?
I've just got to get the new CV knocked up.

241
00:13:21,303 --> 00:13:23,280
Yeah, yeah, knock yourself out.

242
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:26,700
- Well, see you.
- All right, then. Cheers, B.

243
00:13:30,714 --> 00:13:34,396
Sorry, the reason I'm here is
I want to know what your plan of action is.

244
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:36,304
What's your strategy?
What is your business plan?

245
00:13:36,393 --> 00:13:39,679
My plan is when you get some work,
then I can start making some money.

246
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:42,184
Because what I'm no good at is,
you know, breaking an act.

247
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,601
So when I'm successful, you can deduct
12 and a half percent, no problem.

248
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:47,740
15 for adverts.
That's what I'm hanging on for, really.

249
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:50,371
You just want someone
to call up and give me an advert.

250
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,997
That would be amazing, brilliant.

251
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,620
Right, okay.
Make sure the phone's on the hook, then.

252
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:58,302
You joke about it. It was unplugged
for two days. No one noticed.

253
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:05,969
The man does not know where to start, okay?

254
00:14:06,493 --> 00:14:08,831
This is my CV that he's sending
out to people.

255
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:12,642
I mean, casting agents, producers.
He typed it himself, okay.

256
00:14:13,124 --> 00:14:18,037
"From 1986 to 1999 Andy Millman
worked at the Natwest in Wokingham.

257
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:22,018
"Andy left this comfortable,
adequately-paid job

258
00:14:22,099 --> 00:14:26,063
"to try and become an actor,
despite his age, weight and looks.

259
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:29,718
"Andy claims to be a great actor
but has not yet had the chance to prove it

260
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:33,846
"because, so far, he's had no offers
except extra work which, as you know,

261
00:14:33,932 --> 00:14:36,586
"is pointless and badly paid.

262
00:14:36,672 --> 00:14:40,083
"Acting is Andy's dream.
If you can make that dream come true,

263
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:41,872
"please, please call."

264
00:14:41,954 --> 00:14:46,121
- I mean, it's like he's writing to Jim'll Fix It.
- Oh, you have to fire him.

265
00:14:46,203 --> 00:14:50,370
I can't fire him, can I? I can't bear to see
his stupid little face. He'd be devastated.

266
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:53,027
- Yes, but it's your career.
- I know.

267
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:56,398
What are you going to do?
I mean, you'll have to find all your own work.

268
00:14:56,488 --> 00:14:59,458
Yeah, having a dog and barking yourself
springs to mind.

269
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:03,589
Start today, start now.
Go up to the director and ask him for a line.

270
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:06,408
Ross Kemp.
You've spoken to Ross Kemp, haven't you?

271
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:08,674
- Yes.
- Go up to Ross Kemp and ask him for a line.

272
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:12,609
Just say to him, "I thought you were
brilliant in EastEnders, Ultimate Force.

273
00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:14,666
I loved you in Spandau Ballet.

274
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:16,809
- What?
- Spandau Ballet.

275
00:15:16,898 --> 00:15:20,310
He wasn't in Spandau Ballet.
That was Martin Kemp.

276
00:15:20,393 --> 00:15:22,572
Martin Kemp was in EastEnders
and Spandau Ballet.

277
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:24,678
- Who's this one?
- Ross Kemp.

278
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:26,940
- Are they not brothers?
- No.

279
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,420
Martin Kemp and Gary Kemp
were the brothers.

280
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:33,375
- Well, who's this one?
- Ross Kemp.

281
00:15:33,457 --> 00:15:36,428
- Who's his brother?
- I don't know if he's got a brother.

282
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:41,157
Yes, he does. He's got that little bald one
with the pink face that looks like him.

283
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,900
Phil Mitchell?

284
00:15:42,988 --> 00:15:46,511
His on screen brother. Phil and Grant
Mitchell, but they're not really brothers.

285
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:49,730
Yes, they are. They're the Mitchell brothers.

286
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:54,099
What do you mean, the Mitchell brothers?
You know his name is Ross Kemp.

287
00:15:56,727 --> 00:15:58,387
What bit's confusing you?

288
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:01,332
The brothers.

289
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:04,110
The brothers?

290
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:05,497
What?

291
00:16:06,337 --> 00:16:09,589
Is that confusing you, too?
Do you think we've landed in the future?

292
00:16:09,673 --> 00:16:11,412
Shut your face.

293
00:16:12,731 --> 00:16:15,745
MAGGIE: You see, this is why I can never
go and speak to that guy

294
00:16:15,828 --> 00:16:19,679
because I'm not smart enough for him.
He's an intellectual.

295
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,492
How do you know he's an intellectual?
You've never even spoken to him.

296
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:25,707
- Well, he reads the big papers.
- Oh, the big papers, sure.

297
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:28,686
See, it's always the same,
if a bloke is really smart,

298
00:16:28,773 --> 00:16:31,393
I just always worry that
I'm not clever enough for him.

299
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:35,324
He's going to want to talk about politics
or whatever and I won't know what to say.

300
00:16:35,405 --> 00:16:39,652
One time, I went out with this bloke and
we were in the pub playing the quiz machine

301
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:44,014
and it was for a fiver and the question
came up "Who discovered America?"

302
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:46,394
And I just panicked and I said, "Colombo."

303
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:49,656
See, you're laughing because I'm stupid.

304
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,710
No, it's an easy mistake to make.
They sound the same.

305
00:16:52,798 --> 00:16:54,266
That's what I thought.

306
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,323
- You should just go and talk to him.
- You think?

307
00:16:56,411 --> 00:16:59,144
Yeah, I don't know why you're so shy.
Just go and talk to him.

308
00:17:14,797 --> 00:17:16,818
The FT.

309
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,160
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

310
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,609
NASDAQ, you twat, what are you like?

311
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:26,978
- You play the markets, do you?
- Oh, yeah.

312
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:29,044
How's it going? Any tips?

313
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,560
Buy high, buy low. Buy low, sell high.

314
00:17:38,861 --> 00:17:42,588
- What you reading?
- It's Frank Kermode's book on Shakespeare.

315
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:44,457
It's for my new PhD.

316
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,905
Shakespeare, eh? Oh! Bloody genius, him.

317
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,521
Midsummer Night's Dream. Bottom...

318
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:55,413
- Oh, how is your diarrhoea?
- Fine, it's good.

319
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,588
- I'm going to get a coffee, I think.
- I've got to go and call my broker anyway.

320
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:02,041
All right. I was going to ask
if you wanted to get one.

321
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:05,146
Definitely. He's not there anyway,
he's away on holiday.

322
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:09,624
All right.

323
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,169
Hiya.

324
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:22,659
They're making a film over there
with Vinnie Jones.

325
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,905
What's he doing making a film?
He's a bloody footballer.

326
00:18:28,022 --> 00:18:31,512
- Look at the size of those lights.
- You reckon they're big lights?

327
00:18:31,596 --> 00:18:34,295
If I wanted big lights, I could have big lights.

328
00:18:34,376 --> 00:18:37,346
I just don't want big lights.
I want small lights if anything.

329
00:18:41,523 --> 00:18:44,697
I know an old colleague of yours
actually, Shaun Williamson.

330
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:47,390
- Shaun?
- Barry off EastEnders.

331
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,982
- Oh, Barry, yeah.
- Yeah.

332
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:52,083
We've got the same agent
because I'm actually a real actor.

333
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,582
I'm just, well, not just an extra

334
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,875
so if there was a line going in this
with just a little bit of dialogue,

335
00:18:57,963 --> 00:19:01,453
it'd be great for me because,
as I said, I'm a proper actor.

336
00:19:01,537 --> 00:19:04,711
Yeah, I hope you're better than him.
I mean, he's a bloody footballer.

337
00:19:04,793 --> 00:19:07,967
He's good at what he does, isn't he?
The old "hard man" thing, I suppose.

338
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:12,375
- Because he actually is in real life so...
- You reckon? You think he's a tough guy?

339
00:19:12,457 --> 00:19:15,823
I'd like to see him come at me
with all that "I'm a hard bastard" stuff.

340
00:19:15,912 --> 00:19:20,588
I'd say, "Put the baseball bat down,
it's just you and me, skin on skin."

341
00:19:21,511 --> 00:19:24,007
Stripped to the waist, to the death.

342
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:30,044
I'm trained.
He starts with me, I will destroy him.

343
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:39,051
Okay. Well, as I say, if you could
put a word in, I could just do a line.

344
00:19:39,142 --> 00:19:41,920
Yeah, I'll sort that out for you, no problem.
No problem.

345
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:43,979
Really?

346
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:48,627
Cheers. I'll see you later.

347
00:19:55,622 --> 00:20:01,021
I tell you, if there's a hag, a washerwoman,
toothless wench to be had, it'll be me.

348
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:04,547
I'm never the one that gets to wear
the taffeta dress, it's not fair.

349
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,895
- They've padded you up.
- That's actually me.

350
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:12,332
I was going to ask, I hope it doesn't seem
pushy, but would you like to go for a meal?

351
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,554
Yeah, I'm starving.

352
00:20:14,643 --> 00:20:16,744
Oh, not right now but I thought maybe later.

353
00:20:16,827 --> 00:20:20,272
Yeah, no, absolutely, yeah. Oh, I'd love to.

354
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:22,496
- Good.
- Okay, then.

355
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:44,066
What you doing here?
Still scavenging the bins for food, are you?

356
00:20:44,148 --> 00:20:48,112
No need. Bloody waiting on a scene
I've got to do with Ross Kemp.

357
00:20:48,198 --> 00:20:50,852
He asked me personally so... Good, though.

358
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,505
Yeah, well done.

359
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:58,352
- Shame it's only telly but, you know...
- Not really.

360
00:20:58,443 --> 00:21:02,125
It's something. I mean, keep at it,
you might make it into the films.

361
00:21:02,216 --> 00:21:05,310
Yeah, but what I wouldn't do is
do a film with Vinnie Jones,

362
00:21:05,392 --> 00:21:07,052
he's a footballer but that's all right.

363
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,268
You say he's a footballer
but he's still been in films, hasn't he?

364
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:12,852
You know, with John Travolta
and Nicolas Cage.

365
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:16,065
What did he get paid for that, by the way?
Because I was talking to Ross...

366
00:21:16,154 --> 00:21:18,807
You know Ross got a million pounds
to go to ITV?

367
00:21:18,894 --> 00:21:21,988
- Yeah. Pretend to be a hard man.
- Not really.

368
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,165
- Unlike Vinnie. Real life hard man.
- Hmm.

369
00:21:25,247 --> 00:21:29,573
Yeah. On a serious note,
Ross explained to me,

370
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:34,218
you know, Ross was trained by the SAS
and he said if Vinnie Jones

371
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:39,056
tried his antics on with him, he'd rip him
apart so you might want to warn him that.

372
00:21:39,146 --> 00:21:40,535
- He said that?
- Yeah.

373
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:43,427
I'm not stirring shit, just warning.
I don't want to see him get hurt.

374
00:21:43,514 --> 00:21:45,964
I don't care about him,
but I wouldn't want to see him get hurt.

375
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,076
I've said my bit so...

376
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,763
- I've got to go. I'll see you later.
- See you later, mate.

377
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:58,833
You've done so much.

378
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:02,770
Not really. I'm probably a bit older than you.

379
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:04,953
- How old are you?
- 34.

380
00:22:05,037 --> 00:22:08,481
Well, I'm actually older than you
but thank you very much.

381
00:22:08,571 --> 00:22:11,383
Well, you don't look it.
I thought you were in your 20s.

382
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,604
You never, did you? Oh, God.

383
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,506
I'm not!

384
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:22,022
- Anything you fancy?
- Possibly.

385
00:22:23,263 --> 00:22:25,285
- I meant on the menu.
- I know.

386
00:22:35,018 --> 00:22:37,434
- What have you been saying?
- About what?

387
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:41,122
Why am I hearing that Vinnie Jones
is looking for me and he wants to batter me?

388
00:22:41,212 --> 00:22:42,838
I haven't said anything.

389
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,777
How's he know I've been slagging him off?
Who have you been speaking to?

390
00:22:45,858 --> 00:22:48,671
No one. You're not scared of him, are you?

391
00:22:48,757 --> 00:22:51,931
No. Not with what I could do to him.

392
00:22:52,013 --> 00:22:54,430
- With your SAS stuff and that.
- Yeah.

393
00:22:54,515 --> 00:22:56,570
I mean, do you know what that stands for?

394
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:58,952
SAS? Special Air Service.

395
00:23:00,154 --> 00:23:01,780
What?

396
00:23:01,861 --> 00:23:04,075
Special Air Service, isn't it?

397
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:06,784
- It doesn't stand for that.
- Doesn't it?

398
00:23:07,858 --> 00:23:11,427
I've talked to actual SAS people,
they've told me what it stands for.

399
00:23:11,511 --> 00:23:13,171
What does it stand for, then?

400
00:23:14,132 --> 00:23:16,548
Super Army Soldiers.

401
00:23:20,485 --> 00:23:22,664
Su... Are you sure?

402
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:25,640
Yeah, I mean actual SAS people
have told me that.

403
00:23:25,727 --> 00:23:28,584
The actual guys themselves
and they should know.

404
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:32,913
- They weren't winding you up?
- They wouldn't do that to one of their own.

405
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:37,390
No. I thought it was Special Air Services.

406
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:41,208
Special Air Services? I mean, that sounds
like FedEx or something, doesn't it?

407
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:45,856
Registered delivery or whatever. Do you
think a postman needs arms like these?

408
00:23:45,939 --> 00:23:48,830
Did I get these muscles lifting jiffy bags?

409
00:23:52,214 --> 00:23:53,716
Definitely not.

410
00:23:54,676 --> 00:23:59,713
If Vinnie Jones comes near me
looking for a fight, I will unleash hell.

411
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,683
Okay.

412
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:14,570
- Well, that was fun.
- Absolutely.

413
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:17,462
- Do you want to come in for a cup of tea?
- I'd love to.

414
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:18,768
Okay.

415
00:24:20,844 --> 00:24:22,708
Right, just go through.

416
00:24:28,985 --> 00:24:31,119
You're sweet, you're hot chocolate.

417
00:24:40,421 --> 00:24:43,990
Come on, love, you're like a dead horse.
Put a bit of minge around it.

418
00:24:45,345 --> 00:24:46,564
Okay.

419
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:54,513
- I head-butted a horse once.
- He must have really annoyed you.

420
00:24:54,598 --> 00:24:55,987
Kemp.

421
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:57,806
All right, Vinnie, how's it going?

422
00:24:57,894 --> 00:25:01,982
Never mind the "All right, Vinnie, how's it
going" bollocks. What you been saying?

423
00:25:02,063 --> 00:25:04,762
- What are you talking about?
- What's all this I've been hearing?

424
00:25:04,843 --> 00:25:08,332
- Shit about you think you're harder than me.
- Where have you heard this?

425
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:11,906
Some extra I've been doing a scene with
said he heard it over here.

426
00:25:11,991 --> 00:25:15,955
You been trying to impress the extras
by telling them you're harder than me?

427
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,780
I haven't said anything.

428
00:25:17,868 --> 00:25:21,233
You think you're well hard, don't you?
Are you hard?

429
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:22,463
No.

430
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:26,800
No, you're not.
And if I hear you slag me off anymore,

431
00:25:26,882 --> 00:25:29,976
I'll come over here and I'll show you
what really hard is.

432
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,785
- Do you know what really hard is?
- Beating me up and that.

433
00:25:33,871 --> 00:25:35,847
Yeah. Do you know what really hard is?

434
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:37,912
Beating up and that.
Kick him in the bollocks.

435
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:40,259
- No need to be specific.
- All right.

436
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:43,471
This is the final warning.

437
00:25:46,062 --> 00:25:47,530
Come on.

438
00:26:04,686 --> 00:26:06,346
- What?
- Nothing.

439
00:26:10,047 --> 00:26:12,068
Why didn't you use your SAS stuff on him?

440
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:14,644
Because I don't know any.

441
00:26:14,732 --> 00:26:17,827
What, you don't know kung fu
and all the lethal moves?

442
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,050
No.

443
00:26:20,768 --> 00:26:23,218
Why did you say you did?

444
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:27,872
Why do I say I can hold my breath under
water for three and a half minutes? I can't.

445
00:26:28,472 --> 00:26:30,211
I panic in water, if anything.

446
00:26:31,887 --> 00:26:34,937
I can't get you a line either,
if that's why you're still here.

447
00:26:35,024 --> 00:26:38,276
- Really?
- I haven't got any power around here.

448
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,618
I've told people
I've got a line and everything.

449
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:41,843
Sorry.

450
00:26:44,356 --> 00:26:46,061
Don't worry about it.

451
00:26:47,016 --> 00:26:49,230
Every job I do I get bullied.

452
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,900
Bullied?

453
00:26:50,987 --> 00:26:53,246
People calling me names and that.

454
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:58,764
If it doesn't stop soon,
I think I'm just going to finish it, end it all.

455
00:26:59,803 --> 00:27:01,824
Do what I thought I'd never do.

456
00:27:01,908 --> 00:27:03,454
Suicide?

457
00:27:03,536 --> 00:27:07,941
No, go to Family Affairs. I've had an offer.

458
00:27:08,817 --> 00:27:12,025
There's no bullying at Family Affairs,
they're really nice people.

459
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:13,616
Sure.

460
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:17,073
All I want to do is act.

461
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:19,849
And you're good.

462
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,154
Am I?

463
00:27:23,192 --> 00:27:25,213
Yeah, of course you are.

464
00:27:26,488 --> 00:27:28,148
Put your hat on.

465
00:27:29,705 --> 00:27:33,793
Look at that, looks brilliant.
Hair and everything.

466
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:35,694
Yes.

467
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,801
Look at all these.

468
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:40,693
Your medal. Shiny, innit?
