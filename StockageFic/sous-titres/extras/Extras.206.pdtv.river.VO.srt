1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,014
When they get famous, they find
a lot of temptations in their way,

2
00:00:03,055 --> 00:00:06,002
they drink and eat too much, they
get invited to parties and so forth.

3
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:07,486
You know, weight can be a problem.

4
00:00:07,537 --> 00:00:09,876
You look like you have always
struggled with your weight.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,939
Would I be right in that?

6
00:00:13,999 --> 00:00:16,353
It's not a struggle.
The more I eat, the fatter I get.

7
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:18,273
It's easy.

8
00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:21,134
What are your ambitions?
Obviously this's been a big hit for you.

9
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:22,550
A surprise hit,
some would say.

10
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:24,515
But what're the ambitions
you have above this?

11
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:26,254
Do more of the same
or branch out?

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,236
I suppose I would like to do
serious acting,

13
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:31,746
I would like to do films.

14
00:00:31,803 --> 00:00:33,495
Who would you like to meet,
to work with?

15
00:00:33,546 --> 00:00:34,594
You don't know anyone.

16
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:36,542
I know most people in Hollywood.

17
00:00:36,597 --> 00:00:38,519
I've interviewed Tom Cruise
many times,

18
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,329
I've interviewed Robert De Niro,

19
00:00:41,448 --> 00:00:42,675
all the greats.

20
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:46,131
Obviously, Robert De Niro is
the greatest actor in the world, so...

21
00:00:46,182 --> 00:00:47,847
I'd obviously like
to work with him.

22
00:00:47,886 --> 00:00:49,376
Alright, challenge accepted.

23
00:00:50,107 --> 00:00:52,927
Challenge accepted. De Niro.
I will hook you up with De Niro.

24
00:00:52,996 --> 00:00:55,872
-You can get me De Niro?
-Yeah, but lose some weight first.

25
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:02,982
Well done, that was great.

26
00:01:03,038 --> 00:01:05,144
-Really?
-You were fantastic.

27
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:06,758
Are you gonna stay
for a drink?

28
00:01:06,798 --> 00:01:08,797
Wait for me in there.
I've gotta pop downstairs.

29
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:10,807
Don't go anywhere,
I'd really love to chat.

30
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:13,038
Wait for me, I'll be a minute.

31
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,205
Is that your first chat show?
You're not serious.

32
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,150
-I was nervous as well.
-It didn't show.

33
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:23,870
Oh, really?
You were great.

34
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:26,169
Well, I mean, I've done loads.

35
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:30,033
Sorry, have you got a minute to talk to
a big fan of yours from the audience?

36
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,574
Joe, this is Andy.

37
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:36,911
Are you alright?

38
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,589
Can I ask?

39
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,919
Joe's getting into the hospital
next week.

40
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,272
St Matthew's.

41
00:01:44,573 --> 00:01:46,985
Maybe in for quite a long time.

42
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:49,318
Would you pop in
and say hello?

43
00:01:49,353 --> 00:01:50,054
Would I...?

44
00:01:50,656 --> 00:01:53,827
Can you pop in and visit him
whilst he's in the hospital?

45
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:58,215
I'm not sure what I'm doing,
to be honest.

46
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:00,331
Give me your number
and we can arrange something.

47
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,767
Yeah, if you call my agent...

48
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:05,799
Not your agent.
They fob you off, agents.

49
00:02:05,896 --> 00:02:07,778
What's your mobile?

50
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,603
I lost my mobile, I don't know
where it is, at the moment.

51
00:02:12,727 --> 00:02:13,951
It's in your pocket.

52
00:02:14,029 --> 00:02:15,204
It's in my what?

53
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:16,464
It's in your pocket.

54
00:02:18,325 --> 00:02:20,732
I thought I'd looked there!

55
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:24,261
Why didn't I look in there?
Always look in the pocket.

56
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:26,678
Well done, kid.

57
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:27,789
What's your number?

58
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:31,570
Mine?

59
00:02:35,965 --> 00:02:36,461
0...

60
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:39,802
7700...

61
00:02:40,022 --> 00:02:41,034
900...

62
00:02:41,516 --> 00:02:44,998
1...5...8.

63
00:02:46,697 --> 00:02:48,693
I'll just ring you
so I've got it in my...

64
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:51,050
No, that's the old one,
that's the one I lost.

65
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,583
If you're gonna test it,
it's 07-700-900-168.

66
00:02:58,335 --> 00:03:00,593
Okay, I'll ring to confirm monday.

67
00:03:00,621 --> 00:03:02,858
-I don't know if I can...
-You can make on monday.

68
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:05,884
It's half an hour.
Get a cab, you can afford it.

69
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:06,811
I know.

70
00:03:06,956 --> 00:03:08,294
Six o'clock, St Matthew's?

71
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:11,430
He's gonna be on the Parrot Ward,
Neurology block.

72
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:12,640
On six o'clock.

73
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:16,058
See you at six.
Great, thank you very very much.

74
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,099
Say goodbye.

75
00:03:30,157 --> 00:03:32,111
-Bit weird, innit?
-Bit presumptuous.

76
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:33,945
No, I mean, it's weird
she didn't ask <i>me</i>

77
00:03:34,753 --> 00:03:37,549
Knowing what I can do
and how much joy I bring to people.

78
00:03:38,674 --> 00:03:40,068
Maybe she didn't notice me.

79
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:41,753
-Maybe.
-Unlikely.

80
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:44,232
I think you've gotta notice
Robert Lindsay in a room.

81
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,716
No, she probably saw me and thought,

82
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:50,960
"I'd love to ask him first, being
one of Britain's best loved actors,

83
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:53,313
and let's not forget
he can sing and dance,

84
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:56,038
and he has won awards on Broadway,
for Christ's sake."

85
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:57,581
Nah, she...

86
00:03:58,247 --> 00:04:00,172
I know what it was,
she was intimidated.

87
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:02,699
And she caught bird in hand.

88
00:04:03,145 --> 00:04:05,304
"I'll definitely get a yes
from a nobody."

89
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:08,503
Worried about this kid, aren't you?

90
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:10,662
I'm worried about the kid.

91
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:14,830
Because if this so-called mother
is making stupid mistakes like that,

92
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:17,761
choosing you over me, then
what other mistakes is she making?

93
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,593
Is she screwing up his medication?

94
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:22,802
I don't know.

95
00:04:25,354 --> 00:04:27,400
Good luck.
Keep him laughing.

96
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:28,492
Cheers.

97
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:48,299
Would you like to come back
for a nightcap?

98
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:50,442
Yeah, I'd love to.

99
00:04:57,341 --> 00:05:00,867
-Hiya. Nice night?
-Yes, lovely.

100
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:01,876
This is Maggie.

101
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:05,429
You live with your parents?

102
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,623
If you two get up to anything tonight,
can you keep the noise down, dear?

103
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,033
We need to get up early tomorrow.

104
00:05:13,075 --> 00:05:14,499
We're not gonna get up to anything.

105
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:16,144
I think Michael thinks you are.

106
00:05:16,226 --> 00:05:18,521
I think he assumed that's why
you're coming back here.

107
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:21,590
You don't want people saying
you're a prick-tease, love.

108
00:05:21,632 --> 00:05:22,987
Definitely not.

109
00:05:23,097 --> 00:05:25,309
Girl like you,
you're no spring chicken.

110
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,217
You must be sexually active.

111
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:29,097
You look like you know
your way around.

112
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,834
Are you on contraception or
do you want do borrow something?

113
00:05:33,064 --> 00:05:34,875
Are you on contraception?

114
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:39,258
What kind?

115
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:41,442
Just the pill.

116
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:45,451
The pill? Don't go on the pill,
danger of thrombosis!

117
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:47,220
I always use a cap,
didn't I, dear?

118
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:50,566
She does use a cap. But sometimes
I pop a johnny on as well.

119
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:52,460
-Just to be safe.
-Belt-and-braces.

120
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,782
We've got two sons,
that's enough.

121
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:58,004
Now we want the fun
without the responsability.

122
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:03,713
Doesn't have to penetrative sex either,
of course.

123
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:05,192
Plenty of other things to do.

124
00:06:05,261 --> 00:06:07,321
Sometimes you do everything but...

125
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:11,095
An orgasm is an orgasm
is an orgasm!

126
00:06:11,178 --> 00:06:12,311
Indeed.

127
00:06:35,384 --> 00:06:37,789
Do you play at all?
We should definitely have a go.

128
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:39,518
I haven't played for a while...

129
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:41,868
I can see that.
But I've got a court in my backyard.

130
00:06:41,937 --> 00:06:43,872
I will knock you
all over the place.

131
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:46,112
Actually I've got two courts.
Brilliant, thank you.

132
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:48,200
-Is that your wages?
-No.

133
00:06:48,296 --> 00:06:51,918
I've got two of these.
One in Japan, one in New York.

134
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:53,163
I'll set it up.

135
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:55,762
-Hello?
-<i>Hello, it's me.</i>

136
00:06:57,269 --> 00:06:58,375
What can I do for you?

137
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:00,338
Nothing, I just phoned you
for a chat.

138
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:04,817
Oh, god. I've to tell you
about this date that I've been on.

139
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,836
D'you have to tell me right now?

140
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:08,218
Why, are you busy?

141
00:07:08,964 --> 00:07:10,651
I'm in the middle of something.

142
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:12,421
Alright, I'll call you later, then?

143
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:14,744
Yeah, I don't know
when I'll be finished, though.

144
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:17,495
It's all really snowed under.

145
00:07:17,578 --> 00:07:19,804
<i>I've gotta go.
I'll speak to you soon.</i>

146
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:21,808
<i>Alright, I'll speak to you tomorr...</i>

147
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:27,034
That's my toy. But this, it's his toy.
I had to buy this separately.

148
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,868
I love the fact that
your toys have got toys.

149
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:40,611
Okay, so, how did you get on
with the De Niro thing?

150
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:43,210
-What's that?
-For f... I told you.

151
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:45,365
Jonathan Ross told me
he's over here doing a film.

152
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:47,951
You said you'd get me an audition,
make a few phone calls.

153
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,781
I've been looking into it. It's tricky,
'cause all of these people are in L.A...

154
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:53,329
So? You've got a phone!

155
00:07:53,398 --> 00:07:54,780
It's complicated though,

156
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,172
it took me two days to realise
they're 8 hours ahead.

157
00:07:57,256 --> 00:07:59,246
-They're behind.
-Are they?

158
00:07:59,343 --> 00:08:00,891
That explains quite a lot.

159
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:04,056
-What time would it be over there?
-It's four o'clock here.

160
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:07,360
So, eight hours...
You're going up.

161
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:09,697
-Five, six...
-You're still going up!

162
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,720
No, that's down...

163
00:08:10,803 --> 00:08:13,680
No, it's four o'clock here.
So, eight hours, eight o'clock!

164
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:16,334
-That's four hours ahead.
-In the morning!

165
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:20,150
-Suppose they get in at nine.
-Ten. Have a cup of coffee...

166
00:08:21,504 --> 00:08:23,467
-Add eight.
-To what?

167
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,864
-Ten!
-Ten. Eighteen!

168
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:26,371
What d'you mean, eighteen?

169
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:28,832
No, add eight hours, of course.

170
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:31,237
-So call'em at six o'clock.
-Right. Their time.

171
00:08:31,306 --> 00:08:32,371
Our time!

172
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:34,983
Yep. And what time will it be
over there? Ten?

173
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:36,835
-At night?
-In the morning!

174
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:40,140
Forget it. If I get on to Robert De Niro
before you, you're fired.

175
00:08:40,223 --> 00:08:43,416
Okay? I've outgrown you,
I don't know what you're for.

176
00:08:43,513 --> 00:08:47,356
Have another go.
But if I beat you to him, you're fired.

177
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:00,176
Alright?
What're you doing here?

178
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,512
Some more extra work, obviously.

179
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:03,950
That's where it's tight, there.

180
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,443
Andy, I've got to tell you about
this date I went on with this guy.

181
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:11,899
To look at him, you would think
that he was Mister Perfect.

182
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,060
Your dad?

183
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:14,761
-What?
-What'd you say, your dad?

184
00:09:14,816 --> 00:09:17,069
No, a date.
I said I went on a date.

185
00:09:18,963 --> 00:09:22,889
Is this a really bad time? 'Cause I can
easily come back and catch you...

186
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:23,595
That's better.

187
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,185
-on a later date.
-Whatever you did.

188
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,288
We should hook up, 'cause I've hardly
seen you. Well, not in the flesh.

189
00:09:28,385 --> 00:09:30,238
I've seen you in the paper.
In fact...

190
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:33,349
Photograph of you here
with your new best friend.

191
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:38,381
"Wossy takes fwiend for a wide".

192
00:09:38,492 --> 00:09:40,262
That's at his house in Swanage.

193
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:42,281
That was a brilliant day.

194
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:47,009
We should go and get a cup of tea
or something, some time.

195
00:09:47,438 --> 00:09:49,263
Why don't you get it?

196
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:52,415
No, not now.
I'm saying we should...

197
00:09:52,746 --> 00:09:54,931
get together for a cup of tea.

198
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:57,958
If you do wanna hook up,
and do me a favor at the same time,

199
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,984
I've gotta go and see this sick kid
on monday.

200
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,615
I don't know
what to say to him.

201
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,509
If you're there
I'll have someone to talk to.

202
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:06,157
Sure you want <i>me</i>? Sounds like
you should be asking some hot date.

203
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:08,493
No. That'd be awful.
No, you're great.

204
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:11,161
I'll buy myself a new dress, then.

205
00:10:11,493 --> 00:10:12,184
Nothing.

206
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,028
Well, I'll leave you to it, then.

207
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:17,797
-Look at his face.
-Bye.

208
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,327
Why is he on a bike
when he's got about five cars?

209
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:56,730
You bastard!

210
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:05,149
-Cut, cut!
-Sorry.

211
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:09,214
The bucket fell off the thing.

212
00:11:19,084 --> 00:11:20,425
Look who's here.

213
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:23,011
Do the catch-phrase!

214
00:11:23,094 --> 00:11:24,849
They've haven't sit down.

215
00:11:29,176 --> 00:11:30,794
Now, the catch-phrase.

216
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:34,941
Are you having a laugh?
Is she having a laugh?

217
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:37,761
It's good those, very clever.

218
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:40,359
It's my friend Maggie.

219
00:11:46,318 --> 00:11:48,087
What you been doing?

220
00:11:49,152 --> 00:11:50,908
Just laying here.

221
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,272
Comfy?

222
00:12:03,378 --> 00:12:05,562
It's pretty comfy, yeah.

223
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:09,503
And I'm on morphine,
so I can't really feel anything.

224
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:14,204
Rather that than terrible pain.

225
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:22,872
-Are you his girlfriend?
-No.

226
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:24,739
Just a friend.

227
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:27,393
What'd you have a friend
who's a girl? Boring!

228
00:12:27,504 --> 00:12:28,720
They're usually boring,

229
00:12:28,776 --> 00:12:31,845
but because she's so stupid,
that amuses me.

230
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:33,256
I'm not stupid.

231
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,334
She's very dim.

232
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:38,785
That looks like one of those things
that you get a goldfish in at the fair.

233
00:12:38,854 --> 00:12:40,858
-Could you keep a goldfish in there?
-See?

234
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:45,172
-Andy, can I have a word?
-Yeah, sure.

235
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,771
Don't touch anything.

236
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,873
They're not toys.

237
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:53,881
You're a Chelsea fan?

238
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,199
Can I just ask...

239
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,061
It's a very sensitive issue.

240
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:03,572
But if, heaven forbid,
Joe did pass away...

241
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:04,443
Who's Joe?

242
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:06,931
-Joe, my son.
-Oh no, sorry.

243
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,622
If he did pass away, would you say
a few words at his funeral?

244
00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:19,856
I don't even wanna think about that.

245
00:13:19,911 --> 00:13:22,095
-We have to think about it.
-I know.

246
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:25,621
It's something the whole family
would really very much appreciate.

247
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:29,353
You know, knowing how much you mean
to Joe and how much he means to you.

248
00:13:30,888 --> 00:13:34,897
If you could tell me yes,
you'd be happy to say a few words?

249
00:13:37,012 --> 00:13:40,496
I think he's gonna live
a very long time.

250
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:42,321
He may not.

251
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:46,455
I know, but it's mad
to hold someone...

252
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:49,088
to plans that far ahead.

253
00:13:49,143 --> 00:13:50,851
We may even have
as little as six months.

254
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,750
Yes, six months is a long time
on my schedule, 'cause things change...

255
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,294
Can I just say that you promised
you'd be there

256
00:13:57,349 --> 00:14:00,805
unless there's something litteraly
impossible for you to get out of?

257
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,031
Like filming or...?

258
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:04,870
Not a film, that's not important.

259
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:08,534
What do you consider a good enough
excuse to get me out of this?

260
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,730
Just so I don't bother you with like,

261
00:14:10,814 --> 00:14:13,621
"I can't make it
because of this job..."

262
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,307
That's not an excuse.

263
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:17,699
What're we talking?
What sort of...

264
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,939
Can we just talk later?

265
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:28,496
Where is he?
Ah, there he is.

266
00:14:29,976 --> 00:14:33,128
There is the boy,
look at his face!

267
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:36,667
Dumbstruck.
I understand, it's okay.

268
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:39,791
You were expecting
a one hit wonder.

269
00:14:39,957 --> 00:14:43,233
And what do you get?
Bloody british legend!

270
00:14:43,371 --> 00:14:45,334
I know you know me
from "My Family",

271
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,154
biggest and most popular sitcom
in England,

272
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:51,362
but did you know
I'm a serious actor? Oh, yeah.

273
00:14:51,445 --> 00:14:52,896
And I can sing and dance.

274
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:54,942
<i>Make'em laugh, make'em laugh,</i>

275
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:57,306
<i>don't you know that
the world wants to laugh?</i>

276
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:59,740
<i>My dad said,
"Be an actor, my son"</i>

277
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,998
<i>"But be a comical one,
they'll be standing in lines"</i>

278
00:15:04,081 --> 00:15:07,122
<i>"While an old honkey-tonk
monkey shines!"</i>

279
00:15:08,823 --> 00:15:10,454
<i>Gotta dance</i>

280
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:12,404
<i>Broadway rythm, it's got me.</i>

281
00:15:12,473 --> 00:15:16,275
<i>And we dance, oh the Broadway rythm,
driving beating rythm</i>

282
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,312
<i>It's the Broadway melody!</i>

283
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:31,994
Sorry, it's the morphine, I'm tired.

284
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,399
And I wasn't really enjoying it,
to be honest.

285
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:35,422
Rude.

286
00:15:35,753 --> 00:15:37,965
I'm not really into musicals.

287
00:15:38,034 --> 00:15:39,887
So, what are you into?

288
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:42,777
Comedies with catch-phrases
like Andy's.

289
00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:45,376
"Freedom for Tooting."
"Power to the people."

290
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,330
What's that?

291
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,886
Your kid does not know comedy.
Sort it out, now.

292
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:55,218
"Citizen Smith", biggest sitcom
of the seventies.

293
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:57,443
I wasn't born 'til 1993.

294
00:15:57,512 --> 00:16:00,360
I wasn't born until 1949
but I know who Queen Victoria is.

295
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:02,876
For God's sake,
something wrong with your brain?

296
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:05,649
Right, you'll love this.

297
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:08,835
This anecdote has people on the floor
at any function, any dinner party.

298
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,936
And it's not because they're drunk.

299
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:13,853
Because Richard E. Grant loves
this story and he doesn't even drink.

300
00:16:13,936 --> 00:16:15,401
I'm on the set of GBH.

301
00:16:15,511 --> 00:16:18,193
I'm in my trailer.
Knock on the door, guess who it is.

302
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:20,668
Come on, guess.
Alan Bleasdale.

303
00:16:20,972 --> 00:16:23,571
-I don't know who that is.
-Oh, fuck off!

304
00:16:26,655 --> 00:16:28,493
Kid's a waste of space.

305
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,447
That was a nice surprise, wasn't it?

306
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:39,429
That was interesting.

307
00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:43,508
-D'you wanna go for a quick pint?
-I can't tonight.

308
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:46,577
-Why, what're you doing?
-I'm going to the Ivy restaurant.

309
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,900
You know Vernon Kay and Tess Daly?

310
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:50,710
-They've invited me out for a meal.
-Why?

311
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:52,245
Just want to hang out with me.

312
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,577
-Is there room for one more?
-No, I think we're four, it's made up.

313
00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:58,494
-Who's the fourth?
-Jamie Theakston. Nutter.

314
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:02,240
But I promise, I'm gonna visit
the kid next week and...

315
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,433
-Brilliant.
-It's a date.

316
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,728
What's Theako gonna be like
after a few beers?

317
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:09,926
He's mental enough sober.

318
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:27,710
Guess...

319
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,023
You alright?

320
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:32,153
-Is he here?
-Yes.

321
00:17:38,097 --> 00:17:41,623
I haven't got long, just wanna find out
what's going on with this De Niro thing.

322
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:44,471
Did we have a meeting or...?

323
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,964
I don't remember...

324
00:17:46,683 --> 00:17:48,052
planning anything.

325
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,104
-Were you masturbating?
-Sorry, what?

326
00:17:55,215 --> 00:17:57,510
Were you masturbating
when I came in?

327
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,205
Sort of, yeah.

328
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:10,325
-Don't tell anyone.
-Why don't you lock the door?

329
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:13,013
I should've locked the door,
I didn't think ahead, I just...

330
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:15,288
The moment took me, I just... crazy.

331
00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:21,633
It wasn't anything weird.
Just so you know...

332
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:25,158
If you must know,
it was the lady on the pen.

333
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:26,845
It just looks like
a regular lady.

334
00:18:26,914 --> 00:18:28,794
A nice attractive wearing
a bathing costume,

335
00:18:28,835 --> 00:18:32,284
but when you turn it up
the other way, then she's nude.

336
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:34,809
-You got my pen?
-Yes, take your pen, please.

337
00:18:34,961 --> 00:18:36,040
Were you having a wank?

338
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:39,196
I was trying to have a quick one,
but it's like Picadilly Circus in here!

339
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:41,487
I didn't know.
I just walked in and he's...

340
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:44,045
It's your fault, for leaving
your erotic material lying around.

341
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,253
If you leave that stuff about,
what're you gonna do?

342
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:47,973
Why didn't you have one
before he came in?

343
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:51,109
I did, thanks for asking, but I'm
a very sexual being, if you must know.

344
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:52,893
And I produce an ungodly amount of..

345
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,933
Thank you.

346
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:00,646
-This is what I'm talking about.
-We haven't talked about this.

347
00:19:00,716 --> 00:19:02,768
I didn't think
I had to make a list

348
00:19:02,838 --> 00:19:05,209
of things you shouldn't do at work,
one of them...

349
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:07,657
Tossing off over a pen.

350
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:11,127
Do you really
you're earning your 12%

351
00:19:11,196 --> 00:19:13,090
by doing that sort of thing
under the table?

352
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:14,916
Nor do I.

353
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:17,654
So why am I paying you?

354
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,230
That's it.
This is pathetic, really.

355
00:19:22,313 --> 00:19:25,424
I gave you a chance to sort some out,
and you'd rather be doing that.

356
00:19:25,493 --> 00:19:29,073
-Don't... Stop!
-Look at that!

357
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:31,949
God almighty.

358
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:35,239
As far as I'm concerned,
you're fired.

359
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:36,010
That's it.

360
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:37,994
If you fire me,
then you won't know anything

361
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:40,399
about the Robert De Niro
meeting I've set up.

362
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,992
You got me Robert De Niro?

363
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:45,176
Yeah, next week.
What're you doing next monday?

364
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:46,352
What time?

365
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:48,149
-Six o'clock.
-Where?

366
00:19:48,232 --> 00:19:50,402
At his hotel. Dorchester Hotel.

367
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:54,881
So next monday at six o'clock,
at the Dorchester, I'm meeting De Niro.

368
00:19:54,937 --> 00:19:57,709
-If he doesn't turn up, you're fired.
-If he doesn't, it's not my fault.

369
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:59,872
No, you've arranged it,
so it's win-win for me.

370
00:19:59,927 --> 00:20:01,752
Either he's there,
I meet De Niro,

371
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:04,005
Or I turn up and he's not there,
and you're fired.

372
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:06,135
And I get a proper agent.

373
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:13,420
For fuck's sake.

374
00:20:24,618 --> 00:20:25,461
Hi, you alright?

375
00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:29,014
I'm just on my way to the hospital
I'm taking Operation

376
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:30,783
I thought it seemed appropriate.

377
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:33,466
Look, I'm not gonna be able
to make it later.

378
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:35,111
Oh. What d'you mean?

379
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,253
I've got a really important meeting.

380
00:20:37,364 --> 00:20:39,161
What, at that exact time?

381
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,087
-And no other time was available?
-No, he couldn't do any other time.

382
00:20:43,212 --> 00:20:45,257
<i>-Who?</i>
-Robert De Niro.

383
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:48,506
-He couldn't do any other time?
-<i>Did you hear what I said?</i>

384
00:20:48,575 --> 00:20:50,304
Robert De Niro wants to meet me.

385
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:52,336
It's just it's the only time
I have to see you.

386
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:55,820
I'll move it, shall I? "Sorry Mr
De Niro, I know you wanted to meet me,

387
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:57,756
<i>and you've been my hero
all my life,</i>

388
00:20:57,853 --> 00:21:00,936
but I'm meeting up with Maggie
at a very specific time every week,

389
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:02,139
it can't be moved."

390
00:21:02,236 --> 00:21:04,572
Alright.
I'm not having a go.

391
00:21:04,655 --> 00:21:06,826
I'm just disappointed,
that's all.

392
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:09,951
I can't move it, obviously not.
It's really important.

393
00:21:10,048 --> 00:21:11,665
Sorry, I'll see you next week.

394
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,552
Knock knock.

395
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:42,353
-Hello. How are you?
-Good.

396
00:21:43,286 --> 00:21:44,918
Bit of bad news, I'm afraid.

397
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:46,729
Andy can't make it.

398
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:48,512
He's got a really important meeting.

399
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:49,991
You're stuck with me.

400
00:21:50,738 --> 00:21:52,452
But I brought you this, look.

401
00:21:54,388 --> 00:21:55,259
Alright?

402
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:56,794
Even though I'm a girl?

403
00:21:56,863 --> 00:21:58,715
-Nah, it's okay.
-Come on, then.

404
00:21:59,421 --> 00:22:01,011
You set it up.

405
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:13,879
SORRY FOR NOT BEING SUPPORTIVE,
GOOD LUCK WITH THE MEETING. MAGGIE X

406
00:22:23,054 --> 00:22:25,086
You're so rubbish.

407
00:22:25,197 --> 00:22:27,585
I hope my surgeon
is gonna be better than you.

408
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,042
This is just a tiny wee thing
I'm trying to get out here,

409
00:22:30,111 --> 00:22:32,814
from what I've overheard
your tumor is massive.

410
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:38,800
So it'll be easy to get it out.

411
00:22:39,547 --> 00:22:41,178
You know...

412
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,870
Very strange. I'm sure
he'll be here in a second.

413
00:22:54,939 --> 00:22:57,206
It's very unusual
for him to be late.

414
00:23:09,853 --> 00:23:11,333
Have you...

415
00:23:12,605 --> 00:23:14,803
ever driven a taxi for real?

416
00:23:19,553 --> 00:23:20,258
No.

417
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:28,821
I used to have that.

418
00:23:29,604 --> 00:23:31,069
What're you doing here?

419
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,263
-The meeting happened already?
-I didn't go, I came here instead.

420
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:35,272
Why?

421
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:37,721
You know,
don't wanna let people down.

422
00:23:37,818 --> 00:23:39,767
But that's madness,
it's Robert De Niro.

423
00:23:39,906 --> 00:23:40,984
I know.

424
00:23:41,164 --> 00:23:43,002
-No, but that's madness!
-What d'you mean?

425
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:44,551
'Cause it's Robert De Niro!

426
00:23:44,606 --> 00:23:46,542
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity!

427
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:48,422
I thought you were upset...

428
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:50,467
Don't you turn it round to me.

429
00:23:50,592 --> 00:23:53,177
-I got a text of you...
-Don't make me feel guilty!

430
00:23:53,246 --> 00:23:54,781
It made <i>me</i> feel good.
That's why...

431
00:23:54,877 --> 00:23:57,228
That was supposed to be nice,
encouraging.

432
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,427
-And it was.
-If you're going now...

433
00:23:59,524 --> 00:24:01,424
Get a taxi!
It might not be too late.

434
00:24:01,514 --> 00:24:04,017
-It's Robert De Niro!
-I know who it is.

435
00:24:04,072 --> 00:24:06,035
Now I'll feel guilty
for the rest of my life.

436
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:08,026
Don't make me feel bad
for making you feel guilty.

437
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:09,830
But what if your career
was down the pan?

438
00:24:09,892 --> 00:24:12,049
My career is already down the pan.

439
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,040
Now it's my turn to operate!

440
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,261
He's dead.

441
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,145
You're a man of the world,
you'll like this.

442
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:35,304
It's just an ordinary pen,
so it seems.

443
00:24:35,415 --> 00:24:38,940
With a picture of a lady on it,
just in a bathing costume, just normal.

444
00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:40,548
Turn upside down...

445
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:42,082
Oh, what's happened there?

446
00:24:42,207 --> 00:24:43,603
Nudie lady!

447
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:46,340
"You're looking at me?"
I am now!

448
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,293
-It's good, isn't it?
-Yeah.

449
00:24:51,362 --> 00:24:54,058
-Where did you get this?
-My friend Barry gave it to me.

450
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:56,533
Back on, nothing suspiscious.

451
00:24:57,099 --> 00:24:58,385
Turn up the other way.

452
00:24:58,745 --> 00:25:00,708
Oh, hang on, hello!

453
00:25:00,998 --> 00:25:03,625
-Can I have this?
-D'you want it?Take it.

454
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:08,761
D'you wanna go for a pint?

455
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,953
Oh, yeah.

456
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:13,607
-You're in a bad mood?
-No, but hurry up.

457
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:14,782
Dead.

458
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,888
Dead.

459
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:17,913
-Dead.
-Stop picking me off!

460
00:25:17,968 --> 00:25:20,346
If you were hacking at him like that,
he'd be dead.

461
00:25:21,341 --> 00:25:22,613
It's Darren.

462
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:24,632
-What?
-<i>Hello mate, what happened to you?</i>

463
00:25:24,701 --> 00:25:27,287
<i>I'm still here
with Mr Robert De Niro.</i>

464
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:28,476
You with him now?

465
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,268
<i>Yeah, we're just cruising down
to a club, come down, mate.</i>

466
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,307
Can I bring Maggie?

467
00:25:33,377 --> 00:25:35,181
<i>He wants to bring his friend,
is that alright?</i>

468
00:25:35,222 --> 00:25:37,241
<i>-Who's that?
-Friend of his. Lady.</i>

469
00:25:37,338 --> 00:25:39,550
<i>-The lady on the pen?
-I wish!</i>

470
00:25:40,296 --> 00:25:41,430
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

471
00:25:41,554 --> 00:25:43,697
<i>All systems go, mate</i>
-Hold on.

472
00:25:43,863 --> 00:25:46,352
-What're you doing after this?
-Me?

473
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,398
D'you wanna meet Robert De Niro?

474
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,079
-Nah.
-Really?

475
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,719
-I'm only joking. Yeah!
-Alright, then.

476
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:55,263
<i>We'll find somewhere.
I'll text you the dets.</i>

477
00:25:56,037 --> 00:25:58,374
-<i>See you later, mate.</i>
-See you there.

478
00:26:00,044 --> 00:26:01,620
-Really?
-Amazing.

479
00:26:01,717 --> 00:26:03,071
-Let's go.
-Now?

480
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,117
-What about the game?
-We can't just leave him.

481
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,994
We can. Just give him an extra
couple shots of morphine.

482
00:26:08,077 --> 00:26:09,873
No, I'm joking.
Alright, who's go is it?

483
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,616
-You have a go.
-Okay.

484
00:26:18,901 --> 00:26:21,735
What would you rather do, right?
No, listen.

485
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:25,398
Would you rather die
a sad lonely bitter old man

486
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:28,427
in a cold and empty flat, or...

487
00:26:28,551 --> 00:26:32,338
if we're not with anyone in about
five years time, just move in together?

488
00:26:32,946 --> 00:26:34,592
I know what you're trying to do,

489
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:37,053
you're trying to make the first option
sound the worst.

490
00:26:37,122 --> 00:26:38,445
Why is it a cold flat?

491
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:41,280
'Cause you're too fat
to get up and put the heater on.

492
00:26:42,012 --> 00:26:43,599
I've got five years to decide.

493
00:26:43,627 --> 00:26:45,948
Why's it taking you so long
to think of the answer?

494
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,662
Wanna keep my options.
I don't wanna commit.

495
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:53,340
He doesn't wanna see you, Robert.

496
00:26:53,436 --> 00:26:56,284
Yes he does. He does,
'cause I brought DVDs if "My Family".

497
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,694
Everyone like these.

498
00:26:57,764 --> 00:27:00,694
No, I don't. I prefer
that edgy stuff on BBC2.

499
00:27:00,763 --> 00:27:02,049
What are you, a critic?
