1
00:00:01,811 --> 00:00:04,134
It says here
I'm gonna meet a handsome man,

2
00:00:04,189 --> 00:00:06,493
with "bags of personality".

3
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:07,975
I told you. I'm married.

4
00:00:09,293 --> 00:00:12,003
I still can't believe
you got somebody to marry you.

5
00:00:12,044 --> 00:00:14,256
Don't be too amazed,
you haven't seen her.

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,486
Bloody hell, Kimberley,
are you still doing that timesheet?

7
00:00:19,564 --> 00:00:22,162
- Hurry up!
- It's complicated, Mr Stokes.

8
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:24,683
Are you having a laugh?
Is she having a laugh?

9
00:00:27,203 --> 00:00:30,034
You know it gives me a headache
if it's too hard.

10
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:32,335
Funny, that's what the wife
said to me yesterday.

11
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:36,039
I said, "Don't flatter yourself, love.
That's not hard."

12
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:38,545
"It died years ago.
That's rigor mortis!"

13
00:00:40,662 --> 00:00:43,861
Andy Millman as Ray Stokes, in a scene
from BBC1's new sitcom,

14
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:45,246
"When the Whistle Blows".

15
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:47,183
The catch-phrase is
"Are you having a laugh?".

16
00:00:47,232 --> 00:00:49,944
- Did you, Germaine Greer?
- Oh, for goodness' sake, why me?

17
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:52,153
Why do you make me
watch this stuff?

18
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:57,321
<i>This was sexist, misogynistic,
Neanderthal garbage.</i>

19
00:00:57,406 --> 00:01:02,120
<i>It was nothing but really nasty
sub carry-on innuendo.</i>

20
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,929
And it seems that
this talentless Millman individual

21
00:01:05,998 --> 00:01:10,587
also wrote the script? <i>Wrote</i>?
It's supposed to've had a writer?

22
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:12,368
I think he needs a defender.
Mark Kermode.

23
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:15,453
I think Germaine's being flattering
about it. <i>It was horrible.</i>

24
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:17,913
I get the idea,
they all seems to like it.

25
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:20,553
- No, they're slagging you off.
- I'm being sarcastic.

26
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,954
<i>Everyone involved should be
thoroughly ashamed of themselves.</i>

27
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:26,902
Why did Germaine Greer and
all these feminists burn their bras?

28
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:27,991
What was going on there?

29
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:32,443
It was a symbolic gesture, to suggest
emancipation from a patriarcal society.

30
00:01:32,553 --> 00:01:35,345
But a bra is supposed to help,
stop them from getting backache.

31
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:37,211
You couldn't tell'em at the time,
they were furious.

32
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:38,815
Bet they're kicking themselves now,

33
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:40,626
with their boobs all saggy
around their ankles.

34
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:42,976
Sorry, can we concentrate
on the matter at hand?

35
00:01:43,045 --> 00:01:46,570
The weird thing is, the worst the
reviews are, the better the ratings.

36
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:49,196
Strange, think about these people
who make great programs

37
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:51,063
but don't get half your audience.

38
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:53,010
I thought it would be great
to work with them,

39
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,719
'cause they get the critical respect.

40
00:01:54,788 --> 00:01:57,871
Then I thought, no! I much prefer
working with you. Because you've...

41
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,503
You've sold out.

42
00:01:59,562 --> 00:02:01,707
We're all making a fast buck now,
which is great.

43
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:03,443
I don't wanna be doing this
for the rest of my life.

44
00:02:03,504 --> 00:02:05,523
I do wanna be doing this
for the rest of my life.

45
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,163
D'you know how exhausting it is, getting
panned by the critics every week?

46
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:09,878
I've got no respect,
and why should I have?

47
00:02:09,947 --> 00:02:12,131
I'm not an actor,
I shout a catch-phrase.

48
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,200
D'you know why I got into acting
in the first place? Robert De Niro.

49
00:02:15,297 --> 00:02:18,850
D'you think he'd be impressed with wigs
and shouting the same thing every week?

50
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,786
He's got a body of work
he can look back on, be proud of.

51
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:26,896
Get me something I can be proud of.
Has anything classy come in?

52
00:02:26,965 --> 00:02:28,431
Funny you should say that.

53
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,887
BBC, doing more of those modern
adaptations of Shakespeare.

54
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:33,809
Doing King Lear.

55
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,348
- Who's playing Lear?
- Robson Green.

56
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:41,233
Get me some real Shakespeare.
Get me any play.

57
00:02:41,316 --> 00:02:43,943
Play with sorts of an actor
whose career's struggling.

58
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,833
They always pretend it was
their first love, they do a bit of theater,

59
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:49,113
and it gives a bit of cred'.
Get me a play.

60
00:02:49,224 --> 00:02:50,565
The play is the thing.

61
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,251
Well then a play Bar, alright?

62
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:55,500
I'm gonna put this in an e-mail
so you remember as well.

63
00:02:55,735 --> 00:02:58,970
I've got the worst management
in the world.

64
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,541
D'you know what I mean?
I'm successful now.

65
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,513
I'm still surrounded by the D-Team.
Not the A-Team.

66
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:05,648
It'd be hard, though.

67
00:03:05,693 --> 00:03:08,074
They're hiding
in the L.A. underground, so...

68
00:03:08,157 --> 00:03:10,341
- Not <i>the</i> A-Team.
- That's what you said.

69
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,802
No, they're fictional characters.

70
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:15,083
I don't know. Thought it was
a bit weird you mentioned them.

71
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:17,129
- I didn't. I meant the phrase.
- What phrase?

72
00:03:17,184 --> 00:03:19,880
The A-Team, it means the best
possible people for the job.

73
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,286
But the six million dollar man,
was that a phrase?

74
00:03:22,347 --> 00:03:24,705
It's very specific to him,
cause he cost 6 million dollars.

75
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,848
No, that could have been a phrase.

76
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:29,612
"Oh, look at him. He's a right old
six million dollar man, ain't he?"

77
00:03:29,682 --> 00:03:31,064
When would you ever say that?

78
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:33,974
If you saw a man that could run fast
and see really well with one eye.

79
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:37,403
- What's the chance of that?
- I don't know.

80
00:03:37,514 --> 00:03:40,762
- I didn't make up the phrase, did I?
- It's not a phrase.

81
00:03:41,536 --> 00:03:43,458
- See you down there.
- See you later.

82
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:46,885
Lisa, before you go,
could you sign a picture for me?

83
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,466
What's your name again, love?

84
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:56,633
Don't worry about it.

85
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:58,820
If you can't remember my name,
it doesn't matter.

86
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:01,308
I've just forgotten
'cause there's so many people.

87
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:02,401
Right.

88
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:05,067
So, have you forgotten <i>his</i> name, then?

89
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:08,206
Or do you remember the actors,
but not the little people?

90
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:10,942
I've been doing your hair and make-up
for five weeks.

91
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:13,403
- I'm very sorry, I just...
- It's fine.

92
00:04:14,343 --> 00:04:16,804
- Doesn't matter.
- Got a terrible memory.

93
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:18,919
Don't worry about it.

94
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:23,482
Sorry.

95
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:33,699
God, what a bitch!

96
00:04:34,003 --> 00:04:35,897
It's all the same
with some of these people.

97
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:38,785
"I'm on the telly so I'm more important
than the fucking crew!"

98
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:40,997
- Makes me sick.
- What can you do?

99
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,919
<i>I don't know her name!</i>

100
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:45,560
Andy, by the way.

101
00:04:45,657 --> 00:04:47,523
Can <i>you</i> sign me a picture?

102
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,399
Can you sign that?

103
00:04:50,828 --> 00:04:51,975
This one?

104
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:04,017
- Who to?
- Just to me.

105
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,748
What should I put, though?
"To..."

106
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:18,048
To me, and...
"Best wishes" or whatever?

107
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:28,112
What, d'you not wanna sign that?

108
00:05:29,315 --> 00:05:31,541
A pleasure. I was just thinking...

109
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:34,500
I don't wanna spell your name wrong.
How do you spell it?

110
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:35,924
It's just the usual.

111
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:39,685
Okay, let's go for it.

112
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:45,201
Can't write with that, though.
Let me go... I've got a magic marker.

113
00:05:45,243 --> 00:05:47,123
- I've got a magic marker!
- Have you?

114
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:49,293
In my bag.

115
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,567
Thanks.

116
00:05:55,528 --> 00:05:57,312
Let's start with me, first.

117
00:05:57,768 --> 00:06:00,809
"Andy Millman..."
Work backwards.

118
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:03,270
"Best wishes".
I mean that.

119
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:05,027
"To..."

120
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,774
And then your name...

121
00:06:08,981 --> 00:06:13,156
Oh, right! Sorry, before we do that...
Sorry about this.

122
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,110
I must...

123
00:06:15,146 --> 00:06:16,252
Hold on.

124
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:20,787
Let me do this
and we can get on with it.

125
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,474
Good.

126
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:25,460
Do you wanna get this soon,
I'm really conscious of time,

127
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:27,730
I've got to get back on the set.

128
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,805
I know.

129
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:33,132
What's your name?

130
00:06:36,617 --> 00:06:39,658
Well, you'll see what it is now,
because Andy...

131
00:06:39,783 --> 00:06:41,538
is about to write it down.

132
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,354
Stop blowing.
You don't know my name, do you?

133
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,981
- It's not that I don't know it.
- Yeah? What is it then?

134
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:54,340
- Well, in this context...
- Oh, forget it!

135
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:57,907
Honestly, forget it. Doesn't matter.
I've got to get back to the set.

136
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:02,018
Just unbelievable.
Un-fucking-believable.

137
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:07,922
She was upset.

138
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:09,746
Yes, she was.

139
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:12,655
You knew I didn't know her name,
I said to you "I don't know her name".

140
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:14,749
So why did you give me
the magic marker?

141
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:16,090
You needed one...

142
00:07:16,153 --> 00:07:18,849
That was an excuse to leave
and ask someone her name, wasn't it!

143
00:07:18,912 --> 00:07:20,792
That's clever!

144
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:23,100
I'd never have thought
you'd do that!

145
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:29,908
- What're you doing?
- Smell that.

146
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:32,191
Nice. Fabric conditioner.

147
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:34,410
I like smells.

148
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:36,065
I once saw this bar of soap,

149
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:39,388
and it smelled so nice I bit into it
to see how it tasted like.

150
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:41,281
Tasted of soap.

151
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:44,929
Reception say they've got a guy here
who says he knows you?

152
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:45,995
Oh God, who is it?

153
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,202
He says he went to school with you.
Steve Sherwood?

154
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:49,606
Who is it?

155
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,237
- It's what he said.
- He's here now?

156
00:07:51,462 --> 00:07:52,854
Can he come through?

157
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:56,000
- Can you send that guy up?
- Who's that?

158
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:58,723
He was the coolest kid in the school,
everyone wanted to be like him.

159
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:00,040
- Even you?
- I suppose so.

160
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:02,044
- What does he do now?
- Something big in the City.

161
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:03,426
You could still do that.

162
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:05,971
I don't wanna be like him now, do I?
I'm doing really well.

163
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:07,840
He probably wants to be like <i>me</i>,
if anything.

164
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:12,204
He definitely doesn't want
to be like you.

165
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:15,540
Andy Pandy, you little fat puff!

166
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:19,327
Hold on, hold on.

167
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,743
You're with a pretty girl.

168
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:23,828
There can only be one explanation.
Are you a prostitute, darling?

169
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,257
"Pretty girl"...

170
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:27,239
- So you're doing alright.
- Not bad, yeah.

171
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:28,292
Is this the missis?

172
00:08:28,668 --> 00:08:30,253
Why do you protest so much?

173
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,767
You find the idea so repulsive?
She's an attractive lady.

174
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:33,573
Stop it!

175
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,142
- We all thought you were gay at school.
- No, you didn't. Why?

176
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,307
- You never had a girlfriend.
- Not in front of you, I didn't.

177
00:08:38,348 --> 00:08:39,605
So you had a girlfriend.

178
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:41,295
Not 'til he was 28.

179
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:42,911
And she looked like Ronnie Corbett.

180
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:46,848
Why do you think I'm gay?
You don't, do you? I'm not.

181
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:49,117
- You are an actor.
- That is the gayest profession.

182
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,399
- I think "Rent" boys is gayer.
- Well, I wouldn't know.

183
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:52,790
Oh course it is, if...

184
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,890
You tell me, you seem to know all
about "Rent" boys.

185
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,645
I'm not gay. I've never have been,
I've never will be.

186
00:09:04,526 --> 00:09:05,743
Nip that in the bud.

187
00:09:24,116 --> 00:09:26,435
Why are you sitting
on that little chair?

188
00:09:26,937 --> 00:09:29,248
- What'd you want?
- The play.

189
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:32,333
- I talked to one of my contacts...
- You mean Barry from EastEnders?

190
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:35,129
And he's got a friend
who's an actor,

191
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:37,060
he just had a meeting
with Sir Ian McKellen,

192
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:38,778
who's directing a new play.

193
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:41,500
So I called, and you've got a meeting
with McKellen on Wednesday.

194
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:42,363
Really?

195
00:09:42,476 --> 00:09:45,059
- I don't lie to you.
- There are some nice birds around here.

196
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,138
Suppose so.

197
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:47,954
Andy, we'll be ready
in about 5 minutes.

198
00:09:48,131 --> 00:09:49,874
Five minutes is all I need.

199
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:51,956
- What?
- Steve Sherwood. What's your name?

200
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:52,946
Suzie.

201
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:55,203
Nice to meet you, Suzie.
What time do you finish here?

202
00:09:55,316 --> 00:09:58,024
- About ten o'clock.
- Do you mind if I give you a call?

203
00:09:58,965 --> 00:09:59,705
Sure.

204
00:09:59,855 --> 00:10:01,360
- Okay.
- What's your number?

205
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:09,743
Speak to you later.

206
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:14,628
Player!

207
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,088
Respect, man.
Darren Lamb, agent to Andy Millman.

208
00:10:18,158 --> 00:10:20,326
- Steve Sherwood, a friend of mine.
- You're a friend of his?

209
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:23,155
I don't think so, this guy's an
absolute player. Respect again.

210
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:24,761
If we're talking
about the honeys,

211
00:10:24,844 --> 00:10:26,704
there's a chick I've got
my eye on, actually.

212
00:10:26,786 --> 00:10:27,319
Who?

213
00:10:28,073 --> 00:10:29,627
Her. Maggie.

214
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,704
Maggie? Forget it!

215
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:33,851
From what I've heard,
she's pretty easy.

216
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:36,238
She's not <i>that</i> easy.
Good luck.

217
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:37,863
How would you approach her?

218
00:10:37,923 --> 00:10:39,558
Just walk straight up to her
and say...

219
00:10:39,658 --> 00:10:42,417
"I've been admiring you from afar,
and I haven't said anything,

220
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:44,063
but I would love to
take you out one night.

221
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,062
See if we have as good a time
as I think we will.

222
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:48,459
Would you like to have dinner
with me some time, Maggie?"

223
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:50,593
Don't think about it, just do it.

224
00:10:50,642 --> 00:10:53,230
- No, don't do it, please.
- He says "do it".

225
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:54,765
Get over there, go on.

226
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:56,289
Oh, look at him.

227
00:11:01,255 --> 00:11:04,917
Just to let you know that I've been
watching you secretly, without you knowing.

228
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:08,860
I'd be very keen to spend the night
with you and see...

229
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,197
if you enjoy it
as much as I know I will.

230
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,347
And... happy to pay for it, as well.

231
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:17,717
You know, for dinner. If you wanna...
If you eat dinner, obviously you eat dinner.

232
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:20,747
Are you asking me out?

233
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:23,017
You wanna cook me dinner ?

234
00:11:23,445 --> 00:11:25,351
- I can cook if you want, yeah.
- <i>Can</i> you cook?

235
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:26,896
- Yes.
- Okay, then.

236
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:28,641
Really?

237
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:32,894
Okay, cool.

238
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:34,579
I'll give you a call, shall I?

239
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,384
- See you later.
- Bye.

240
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:43,105
What'd she say?

241
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:45,292
- She said yes.
- Really?

242
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:46,807
Oh, my God.

243
00:11:47,098 --> 00:11:49,696
It's worse than I thought.
She's hit rock bottom.

244
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:51,701
Yes, she has!

245
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:54,879
D'you know what, I've never seen him
even try and chat a woman.

246
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,828
I wouldn't do it
in front of you, would I?

247
00:11:56,854 --> 00:11:58,294
I'm beginning to think
he might be a bit gay.

248
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
Join the club.

249
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:01,512
Don't join any club, 'cause I'm not.

250
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:03,992
- You could chat a woman?
- If I wanted to, yes.

251
00:12:04,017 --> 00:12:04,732
Go on, then.

252
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:06,423
- I don't wanna.
- We've both done it.

253
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:08,120
Go on. This one coming up.

254
00:12:12,954 --> 00:12:13,583
Hi.

255
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,946
Do you know...
what time you finish tonight?

256
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:19,012
I don't know,
about ten-ish I think.

257
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:35,980
Just wanted to know
what time you finished. Cheers.

258
00:12:37,614 --> 00:12:38,825
I was unlucky.

259
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:42,016
She answered me and everything,
ten o'clock, she said.

260
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,221
Still...

261
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:45,994
Sparkling.

262
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,199
...she definitely noticed.

263
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:52,978
Tilly, I thought she was...

264
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:55,036
...interesting.

265
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:06,786
- Andy, do sit down.
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Sir Ian.

266
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:09,784
Please, no titles in the workplace.

267
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,211
Good.

268
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:19,205
Not much theatre work of late?

269
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:20,731
That's fine.

270
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:22,503
You're in good hands here.

271
00:13:24,994 --> 00:13:27,407
How do I act so well?

272
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:31,084
What I do is...

273
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:36,557
I pretend to be the person
I'm portraying in the film or play.

274
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:40,173
You're confused.

275
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,578
It's perfectly simple to...
case in point.

276
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:45,855
Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson
comes from New Zealand, says to me:

277
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:48,977
"Sir Ian, I want you to be
Gandalf the Wizard."

278
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,248
And I said to him:

279
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:53,748
"You are aware
that I am not really a wizard?"

280
00:13:55,953 --> 00:13:57,819
And he said: "Yes, I am aware of that."

281
00:13:57,888 --> 00:14:02,384
"What I want you to do is to use
your acting skills to portray...

282
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:03,772
the wizard.

283
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:05,614
For the duration of the film."

284
00:14:06,185 --> 00:14:07,311
So I said okay.

285
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,407
And then I said to myself:

286
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:12,013
"How will I do that?"

287
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:14,804
And this is what I did.

288
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:20,275
I imagined what it would be like
to be a wizard,

289
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:21,740
and then...

290
00:14:22,203 --> 00:14:26,883
I pretended and acted
in that way on the day.

291
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:33,196
And how did I know what to say?

292
00:14:33,265 --> 00:14:36,233
The words were written down
for me in a script.

293
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:38,446
How did I know where to stand?

294
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:40,165
People told me.

295
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:46,610
If we were to draw a graph
of my process, of my method,

296
00:14:46,694 --> 00:14:47,804
it'd be something like this.

297
00:14:47,865 --> 00:14:50,317
Sir Ian, Sir Ian, Sir Ian, action...

298
00:14:50,363 --> 00:14:53,539
Wizard: "You shall not pass!"
Cut!
(j'ai beau googler lord of the rings, ya rien avant "you shall not pass" dans le film)

299
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:55,606
Sir Ian, Sir Ian, Sir Ian.

300
00:14:56,924 --> 00:14:58,027
Okay, you get it?

301
00:14:58,304 --> 00:15:02,445
Now, <i>you</i> would be pretending
to be John in this play.

302
00:15:02,953 --> 00:15:06,839
And how would you know what to say?
Well, the words would be in the script.

303
00:15:07,223 --> 00:15:10,731
And you would learn the words. You
wouldn't have the script on the night.

304
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,305
And that goes for everybody.
No script on the night!

305
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,555
You learn the words.

306
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:17,430
You'll speak them as if you were
saying them for the first time.

307
00:15:17,476 --> 00:15:19,644
- I didn't think we'd have the script.
- Nobody won't.

308
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,992
Because if you did,
it would break the illusion,

309
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:25,530
and the whole thing is illusion,
do you see? You are not really John!

310
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,377
- No, I know.
- You are pretending. And that...

311
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,319
is acting.

312
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:36,990
What's the...

313
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:41,477
What's the play about?

314
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:44,624
It's a new play by Charlie,
Charlie Haywood.

315
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:48,764
As I said, you'll do the part of John,
and you're in love with Fran.

316
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,428
And the whole centerpiece
of the play is...

317
00:15:51,504 --> 00:15:54,440
the emotional confrontation
when the two of you address

318
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:56,849
those unspoken feelings

319
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:58,550
that you've been bottling up.

320
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,628
- That sounds challenging.
- I hope so.

321
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:03,789
And I don't know,
is it anything you'd be inter...

322
00:16:03,849 --> 00:16:06,755
Definitely, yeah.

323
00:16:07,628 --> 00:16:09,872
So let me introduce you to the team.

324
00:16:09,947 --> 00:16:11,678
There's Fran, who's your lover...

325
00:16:11,844 --> 00:16:15,578
played by Leslie.
Leslie, this is Andy.

326
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,437
You're Fran?

327
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:18,581
Fran's a man?

328
00:16:18,657 --> 00:16:22,315
Can be, 'cause
Fran Healy of... Travis.

329
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:23,234
What?

330
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:28,217
And our clever little writer, Charlie.

331
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:30,431
Who's a woman.

332
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,081
I'm Fran's lover in this?

333
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:37,009
Can I have a quick look
at the... script?

334
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,150
No one said anything about...

335
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:42,791
And I don't know if you...

336
00:16:43,995 --> 00:16:44,899
I just wanna...

337
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,775
We thought we might do a little
workshop for some of the lines,

338
00:16:47,835 --> 00:16:50,500
to get it up on its feet,
kicking it around a bit.

339
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,277
Do you have time for that?

340
00:16:53,872 --> 00:16:57,260
Can I get you something?
Some water? Cup of tea?

341
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:59,729
George, will you get Andy
a cup of tea?

342
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,174
Yeah, no problem.

343
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:03,117
George, 'course.

344
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:07,724
Alright?

345
00:17:09,124 --> 00:17:10,660
Moron.

346
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:13,181
- You're talking to me?
- Yeah.

347
00:17:13,226 --> 00:17:15,116
Why didn't you tell me
it was a gay play?

348
00:17:15,832 --> 00:17:17,887
The play that you got me.
A Month for Summers.

349
00:17:17,947 --> 00:17:20,091
It's a gay play, I've gotta play gay
with another gay.

350
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:23,458
Acting all gay
all through the play, it's...

351
00:17:23,548 --> 00:17:25,024
It's so gay.

352
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,035
Do not worry.
Do you know why?

353
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:31,456
- Gay, my friend, is all the rage.
- What does that mean?

354
00:17:31,553 --> 00:17:32,437
Let me tell you.

355
00:17:32,513 --> 00:17:35,472
It will show you are sensitive.
That you are versatile.

356
00:17:35,563 --> 00:17:37,701
Alright?
Case in point, Mr Thomas Hanks.

357
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:41,344
People weren't interested in Tom Hanks.
Suddently he does the film "Phildelphia".

358
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:44,912
He played a skinny little bent fella.
Remember?

359
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:47,005
After that, everyone loved him!

360
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:49,308
Or those two guys
from Brokeback Mountain.

361
00:17:49,383 --> 00:17:51,431
They're not even gay!
And I was watching...

362
00:17:51,474 --> 00:17:53,771
and they were getting off on each other,
I was sick to the stomach!

363
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,926
They were so convincing, even though
I was like "They're not really queer!",

364
00:17:56,987 --> 00:17:58,387
I was still repulsed.

365
00:17:58,672 --> 00:18:00,284
'Cause of how good they were.

366
00:18:01,187 --> 00:18:03,174
When did you go and see
Brokeback Mountain?

367
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:05,388
I watched on DVD with Barry.

368
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:10,191
I don't know.

369
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:33,835
John...

370
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:36,696
I love you.

371
00:18:38,277 --> 00:18:39,481
I know.

372
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:41,921
Yes, that's lovely.

373
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:44,646
Thanks.

374
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:55,110
Hi, can I just check there are some tickets
for my colleagues from the BBC,

375
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:58,151
Damon Beesley, plus one,
and Ian Morris, plus one.

376
00:18:58,543 --> 00:19:00,455
- Yeah, we got them.
- Great.

377
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,457
Andy Pandy!

378
00:19:04,173 --> 00:19:07,682
You remember these boys from school?
Knobby, Bossog, Gotwin.

379
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:11,145
- You're not here for the play, are you?
- Yeah, we got tickets.

380
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:12,733
No, not your type of thing.

381
00:19:12,787 --> 00:19:14,643
We're looking forward to it.
What's it about?

382
00:19:14,682 --> 00:19:16,942
It's all feelings and emotions,
I'm just here for...

383
00:19:17,092 --> 00:19:19,064
Oh, no.
Oh, God, look at that.

384
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:21,127
- Poufters at twelve o'clock.
- What can you do?

385
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:23,310
- They're your audience, is it?
- No way!

386
00:19:25,689 --> 00:19:26,788
Fans.

387
00:19:26,863 --> 00:19:29,468
- Thanks for sorting our tickets, love.
- No worries.

388
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:31,832
Why're you sorting the Village People
out tickets?

389
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:33,955
This is guess whooo?

390
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:36,748
- Bunny!
- Christ.

391
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:40,783
I couldn't miss my little genius
fast grown-up play!

392
00:19:40,873 --> 00:19:43,990
You do hang around with
all the butch boys, don't you? Hello.

393
00:19:44,035 --> 00:19:47,076
- I'm Bunny.
- He was... How's the wife?

394
00:19:47,212 --> 00:19:50,358
Gone. I'd been living a lie
and she knew it. But now...

395
00:19:50,449 --> 00:19:53,746
I'm able to go and enjoy
some serious cock guilt-free,

396
00:19:53,836 --> 00:19:56,125
yumma-yumma-yumma!

397
00:19:56,592 --> 00:19:57,736
Break a leg!

398
00:19:57,811 --> 00:20:00,928
Okay, I gotta get changed.

399
00:20:01,154 --> 00:20:04,120
Come down for a few beers if you want,
but don't hang around for this shit.

400
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,328
- How're you doing?
- Good.

401
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,662
I've just been talking to Leslie.

402
00:20:16,768 --> 00:20:19,388
We think it would be better
if at the end of Act Two,

403
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:21,300
you were to kiss each other.

404
00:20:26,478 --> 00:20:30,062
You know? Leslie and you
kiss each other at the end of Act Two.

405
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:33,119
Why?

406
00:20:34,384 --> 00:20:35,935
It's just too obvious.

407
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,396
No! Dear, don't forget,

408
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,843
you've finally been able to express
your feelings toward each other.

409
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:43,868
For the first time in twenty years.
I think a kiss would be...

410
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:47,316
a sort of physicalisation
of this emotional liberation.

411
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:50,553
You know? Your freedom
to show the world what you are.

412
00:20:50,643 --> 00:20:51,848
Not the whole world, though.

413
00:20:51,908 --> 00:20:54,483
Let's give'em a clue,
but let's keep it subtle.

414
00:20:54,603 --> 00:20:56,982
If he just leans over you,

415
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:59,993
- and kisses you...
- ...on the cheek. Shake hands.

416
00:21:00,113 --> 00:21:03,411
Curtain comes down, bravo! Encore!
What a brilliantly directed play!

417
00:21:03,486 --> 00:21:05,488
Thank you, dear, but...

418
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,476
- He must kiss you on the lips.
- He can't.

419
00:21:07,536 --> 00:21:09,358
- Why's that?
- Cold sore.

420
00:21:09,886 --> 00:21:12,152
Yeah. Opening night.
Sod's law.

421
00:21:12,241 --> 00:21:13,680
You can't see it's under the...

422
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:16,721
- Don't you worry about that.
- I do worry about that.

423
00:21:16,812 --> 00:21:19,357
We'll sort that out.
Old theatre trick.

424
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:22,217
George, can you get us
some vaseline?

425
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:29,105
Hello. Alright?

426
00:21:29,376 --> 00:21:31,965
Come in. The crib.

427
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,489
- It's big.
- Well, yes.

428
00:21:36,392 --> 00:21:38,048
- I brought you...
- Thank you.

429
00:21:38,124 --> 00:21:40,503
- Is that red or white?
- Red, but I drink anything.

430
00:21:40,593 --> 00:21:42,746
No, I got a bottle of red myself, so...

431
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:44,929
So, obviously, we're both fans or red.

432
00:21:45,787 --> 00:21:47,925
- I quite like white.
- I drink anything, me.

433
00:21:47,985 --> 00:21:50,906
Do you want... Let me take your coat,
it's quite hot in here.

434
00:21:50,996 --> 00:21:52,759
- 'Cause of the cooking.
- It's a nice smell.

435
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:55,469
Yeah, no, it's what I was going for,
sort of oriental.

436
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,712
Just hang it up here.

437
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,979
Come on, Fran,
you're like an old lady!

438
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:35,607
I stopped to pick up this shell.
Look.

439
00:22:35,727 --> 00:22:38,498
- It's beautiful.
- It is.

440
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:50,332
Do you remember the first time
we came here?

441
00:22:51,687 --> 00:22:53,178
- With Paul.
- Yeah.

442
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,552
Oh, bloody sea!

443
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:01,669
- Why are you so scared of the sea?
- I'm not scared of the sea.

444
00:23:01,775 --> 00:23:02,844
It's just...

445
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:07,104
When it gets in your shoes, the salted
water just rots away the stitches,

446
00:23:07,224 --> 00:23:10,416
and they fall apart...
And you have to throw them away.

447
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:14,752
- You're still talking about the sea?
- 'Course, what else?

448
00:23:15,971 --> 00:23:17,537
You're mad.

449
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:26,661
I'm going back to the beach house.

450
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:33,045
Fran, wait for me!

451
00:23:43,028 --> 00:23:44,428
You gotta go like that.

452
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:52,649
I like the sound of it.

453
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:55,826
I know, but you can't have a proper
cuisine's dinner in Ibiza.

454
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:18,742
- You okay?
- Yeah, just...

455
00:24:18,847 --> 00:24:20,548
Just waiting for the system to refill.

456
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:23,530
There's a... I just left a bit of...

457
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:27,550
It didn't flush away completely, so...
Anyway.

458
00:24:32,698 --> 00:24:35,453
- Are you gonna sit down?
- No, 'cause it's on my mind...

459
00:24:35,499 --> 00:24:39,609
...to be honest, so...
I wanna get it sorted.

460
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,561
Is that alright?

461
00:24:53,861 --> 00:24:55,382
Let's have another go.

462
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:07,216
Oh, for fuck's sake!

463
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:13,027
Don't worry about it.

464
00:25:13,132 --> 00:25:14,939
You know, I don't
to have to see it.

465
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,122
I don't want you to have
to worry about it.

466
00:25:30,282 --> 00:25:32,225
That's just mashing it up.

467
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,580
You kept the shell.

468
00:25:50,146 --> 00:25:53,172
'Course I did,
you gave it to me.

469
00:25:53,805 --> 00:25:55,567
It wasn't mine to give.

470
00:25:56,575 --> 00:25:58,051
I kept it anyway.

471
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,392
Near the knee.

472
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,629
John...

473
00:26:10,548 --> 00:26:13,213
- I love you.
- In the play.

474
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:14,583
I know.

475
00:26:17,804 --> 00:26:20,003
- I'm going to kiss you.
- No point.

476
00:26:20,698 --> 00:26:23,209
Silly. Sometimes I don't know
what you're talking about.

477
00:26:23,254 --> 00:26:26,371
We do, we agreed. If any nonsense
happens, I'm going home.

478
00:26:26,446 --> 00:26:30,301
Let's just have a lovely evening
and appreciate the stars and the moon.

479
00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:32,694
As agreed. Okay? So...

480
00:26:32,815 --> 00:26:35,118
Just run to the next... bit.

481
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,602
Not gonna happen.

482
00:26:38,566 --> 00:26:40,689
What the fuck's that?

483
00:26:40,855 --> 00:26:43,475
What're you doing?
It's like Deliverance in here!

484
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,890
What're you playing at?

485
00:26:47,224 --> 00:26:49,332
I said I wouldn't do the kiss.

486
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:53,925
McKellen comes to me five minutes before
and drops that bombshell on me:

487
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,431
"Oh, we'd like you to do the kiss!"

488
00:26:55,521 --> 00:26:57,147
Not my cup of tea, mate.

489
00:26:57,463 --> 00:27:01,348
And then all that...
and him, a knight of the realm.

490
00:27:02,296 --> 00:27:04,329
D'you wanna do the end bit
without that?

491
00:27:04,946 --> 00:27:06,647
Oh, he's got the hump.

492
00:27:09,012 --> 00:27:11,888
No understudies, I'm afraid.
It's the end of the run.

493
00:27:12,008 --> 00:27:14,462
Sorry about that.
We're nearly finished anyway.

494
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,751
To be fair, there was about
five minutes to go, wasn't there?

495
00:27:16,796 --> 00:27:18,211
All you missed was...

496
00:27:18,738 --> 00:27:20,997
We find out that
me and Fran,

497
00:27:21,102 --> 00:27:24,209
we both have had it off
with Paul, we mentioned earlier.

498
00:27:25,046 --> 00:27:28,961
Paul killed himself 'cause
he was racked with guilt about...

499
00:27:29,263 --> 00:27:31,386
doing it with both of us
behind everyone's back.

500
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:33,268
So...

501
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,808
She's writing all this down?

502
00:27:38,898 --> 00:27:40,675
That's not gonna be good, is it?

503
00:27:50,817 --> 00:27:53,602
Are you having a laugh?
