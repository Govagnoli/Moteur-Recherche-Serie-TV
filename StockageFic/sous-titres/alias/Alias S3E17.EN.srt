1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,163
<i>Previously on "Alias."</i>

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,494
Bomani's become the largest
arms dealer in Africa,

3
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:06,710
with strong ties
to The Covenant.

4
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:10,962
I could help you
become more powerful than ever.

5
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:17,554
You know about The Passenger?

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,977
Excuse me?

7
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,350
The Passenger.

8
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,560
Dixon, it's me.
I'm at the Naval Hospital.

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,690
There's a sniper.
Lazarey's been shot!

10
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,106
Our superiors
would like to know

11
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,603
how your efforts in securing
a scapegoat are progressing.

12
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,655
I've already taken care of it.

13
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,656
Jack.

14
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,666
To what do I owe this pleasure?

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,501
I take no pleasure in this,
Arvin.

16
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:50,872
I've got the artefact.

17
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,174
I'll meet you
at the rendezvous point.

18
00:00:56,348 --> 00:01:00,048
I know you removed an artefact
from Project: Black Hole

19
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,385
to trade with The Covenant.

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,317
Based on
recently acquired intelligence,

21
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,277
we know Sark was promoted
to co-command

22
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,024
The Covenant's
North American operations.

23
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,024
Senator Reed, it's imperative

24
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,489
we learn the identity
of his associate.

25
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,741
I enhanced the audio.

26
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,613
It turns out our friend Mr. Sark
made a phone call.

27
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,199
Notify the extraction team.

28
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,370
Not if I see you first, love.

29
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,211
See you later?

30
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:33,252
Not if I see you first, love.

31
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,767
Lauren's parents
have been married for 34 years,

32
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,766
and they still love
being together.

33
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,396
I had one day off this month,
and I spent it playing hockey

34
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,980
at the rink
with high school kids.

35
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,186
That must be fun.

36
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,999
If I need it,
can I crash on your couch?

37
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,303
Yeah.

38
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,546
You just have to wipe off
the Cheese Nips.

39
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,017
Hey, I'm sorry, man.

40
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,233
Hello?

41
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,527
I may have a lead
on the box from Lot 45.

42
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,563
Not where it is,

43
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,650
but a map that'll lead us
to the key that opens it.

44
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,613
Project: Black Hole has had
the Rambaldi box for two years,

45
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,115
and hasn't been able to do that.

46
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,957
Without the key, The Covenant
won't be able to, either.

47
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,536
That's why we have to get it.

48
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,121
I'm getting the intel
from Mexico City.

49
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,670
Plane's waiting on you at Dover.

50
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:55,040
- I'd like to go with him.
- Is that a good idea?

51
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:55,915
Sloane was clear.

52
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,508
Whatever is in the box presents
a significant threat to you.

53
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,627
Sloane could be lying.

54
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,676
Even if he's not, the box
has one inscription on it.

55
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,715
"Irina."

56
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,054
I need to find out why.

57
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,893
You'll report to me as soon as
you get back from Mexico City.

58
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,854
Lauren.

59
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,947
Your father has ordered
an official enquiry

60
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,361
into the disappearance
of the box

61
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,490
from Project: Black Hole.

62
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,365
I've already been questioned
about what I know.

63
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,032
Which is nothing.

64
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,085
I appreciate that.

65
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,748
Not at all.

66
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,673
You know where my loyalties lie.

67
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,727
The box you lost
has not been opened

68
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,889
since the time of Rambaldi,

69
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,104
though there is a legend
Joseph Stalin

70
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,935
made the greatest effort.

71
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,901
Stalin knew about Rambaldi?

72
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,395
He, too, was a believer.

73
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,570
The Rambaldi box
is of particular interest,

74
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,662
because it was rumoured
to contain the strain

75
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,448
of a plague-like bioweapon
capable of killing millions.

76
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,247
Stalin obtained the box.

77
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:18,038
But the key to opening it
eluded him.

78
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,674
He sent teams of archaeologists

79
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,511
around the globe
in search of the key.

80
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:32,060
As legend has it, in 1941,

81
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:35,432
a discovery was made
in the Karoo desert.

82
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:41,395
What they found was a map
made of crystal.

83
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,989
The etchings in the crystal

84
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:48,120
were a guide to the key
that opened the box.

85
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,996
Unfortunately,

86
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,830
obsessed with gaining
sole credit for the discovery,

87
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,418
the archaeologists
turned on one another.

88
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,682
And the map,
along with the two men,

89
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,261
were reclaimed by the desert,

90
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,392
never to be heard from again.

91
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,064
Until now.

92
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,397
I received this two days ago

93
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,326
from a contact in South Africa.

94
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,525
Bomani.

95
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,948
Where are they?

96
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,529
The Karoo desert.

97
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:36,871
My contact surveilled Mr. Bomani
with a hidden camera

98
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,915
as he discovered the bodies
of the men and the map.

99
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,631
That's the map?

100
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,839
There are etchings
in the crystal.

101
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,504
A route of some kind.

102
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,881
This bioweapon.
What do you know about it?

103
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:53,801
Only that The Covenant
refers to it as The Passenger.

104
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,058
Where is your contact now?

105
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,391
Can we speak with him?

106
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,687
I am afraid not.

107
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:04,189
Bomani discovered
he was being surveilled.

108
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,566
Son of a bitch.

109
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,486
You see those trucks?

110
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,454
Omnifam.

111
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,126
Explain this to me.

112
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,661
Kazari Bomani using your trucks
to do The Covenant's work.

113
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,127
I entered into
a relationship with Bomani

114
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,707
at the insistence of the CIA,

115
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,629
who forced me to partner
with him

116
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,630
so I could stay close
to The Covenant.

117
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,762
Your job was to provide us
with intel,

118
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,305
not offer material
assistance to The Covenant

119
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,600
in their search
for The Passenger.

120
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,060
In order to maintain my cover,

121
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:43,396
I had to grant Bomani access
to certain Omnifam resources.

122
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,693
Check the report, Sydney.

123
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,903
I detailed all of this.

124
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,734
You committed treason
by spying on your country.

125
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,661
I won't put much stock
in your reports.

126
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,237
I'm not the mole
you're looking for.

127
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,446
You know what will happen

128
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,166
if your pardon agreement
is revoked.

129
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,707
The death penalty
that was commuted

130
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,203
when you entered into it
will be reinstated.

131
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,673
Then I will die knowing

132
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,759
that I have honoured
my agreement to the letter.

133
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,338
Where is Bomani?

134
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,098
I have no idea.

135
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,849
But in exchange for certain
creature comforts...

136
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,270
When I was falsely accused,

137
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:23,400
I was reading "The Iliad"
in the original Greek.

138
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,442
I'm listening.

139
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,356
All Omnifam trucks are equipped

140
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,606
with global positioning
transponders.

141
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,989
If I give you
the corresponding codes,

142
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,660
you can track Bomani's
movements via satellite.

143
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,039
You have such
a beautiful smile, Sydney.

144
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,878
I miss it.

145
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,299
If you're executed,
I'll be a witness.

146
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,056
I'll smile then.

147
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,643
So, how was your trip?

148
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,142
It was good.

149
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,693
Well, what happened?

150
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,648
You know, we...

151
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,983
We got what we needed to get,

152
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,990
and we're just waiting
to see how it pans out.

153
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,374
Michael.

154
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,949
I got you something
while you were gone.

155
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,666
Open it.

156
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,795
I realised I forgot
the anniversary

157
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,044
of your father's death.

158
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,134
I felt terribly,

159
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,592
and I wanted to do something
special to make up for it.

160
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,930
It's the watch he gave you.

161
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,932
I had it fixed.

162
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,770
This isn't working.

163
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,405
It's not?

164
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,565
Not the watch.
Us.

165
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,782
This isn't working for me.

166
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,579
I'm not happy.

167
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,907
I see.

168
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,460
I don't know.

169
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,830
I guess for a while,
I thought I could be again.

170
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,844
But I don't think
that's gonna happen.

171
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,475
I think we should separate.

172
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,220
This is about Sydney, isn't it?

173
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,344
No, it isn't.

174
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,230
Did she give you an ultimatum?

175
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,940
This is about us, our problem.

176
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,271
She is our problem.

177
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,483
Michael, if you're going
to destroy my life,

178
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,406
the least you can do
is be honest about why.

179
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,995
We have a problem.

180
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,718
Have you been made?

181
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,922
Of course not.

182
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,473
If he knew I was Covenant,
he would arrest me,

183
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,186
not break up with me.

184
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,356
Well, he's obviously
grown tired of you.

185
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,767
Perhaps because
of another woman?

186
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,565
My access extends
beyond my husband.

187
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,197
Perhaps.

188
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,108
But Vaughn is central

189
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,320
to the CIA's efforts
regarding The Passenger.

190
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,994
So you must do everything
possible to keep him close.

191
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,121
What are you proposing?

192
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,700
The last time Sydney Bristow
induced your husband

193
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,167
to stray from
a committed relationship,

194
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,498
he was dating Alice Williams.

195
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,427
When her father died...

196
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,717
Vaughn recommitted.

197
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,049
I am not going to kill
my father.

198
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,052
Need I remind you
that you expressed

199
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,102
no such compunction
about killing my father?

200
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,896
You asked me to kill Lazarey.

201
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,473
And now I'm asking you
to kill Senator Reed.

202
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,228
The answer is no.

203
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,953
Mrs. Reed,
my name is Jack Bristow.

204
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,324
I'm here to see your husband.

205
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,329
Please, come in.

206
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,251
George tells me
you work with Lauren.

207
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,802
Yes, I do.

208
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,175
What you all do is so important.

209
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,841
Forgive me for saying so,

210
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,135
but I think the country's
lucky to have her, don't you?

211
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,602
Absolutely.

212
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:12,020
The omnibus reconciliation bill
is snagged on the intel budget.

213
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:15,357
Can you believe that?
In this day and age.

214
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,195
Well, I'm off to give a speech
at the central library.

215
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,901
Olivia chairs
the largest literacy programme

216
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,271
in the country.

217
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,237
Does more good in a year
than I do in a 6-year term.

218
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,321
I'll be back after dinner.

219
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,952
Remember to take your pill.

220
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,910
It was very nice to meet you.

221
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,548
Okay.

222
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,792
Let's see it.

223
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,428
What I have is a paper trail.

224
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,421
Not definitive proof,

225
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,756
but the beginning of what
Director Dixon and I

226
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,764
believe to be a strong case
for the existence of a mole.

227
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,017
Other than Sloane?

228
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,850
Or instead of him.

229
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,520
At this point, that is unclear.

230
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,398
Is it that hard to identify
a traitor?

231
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:04,949
Honestly, sometimes I think
you people just get too close.

232
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,542
I don't understand.

233
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,127
Unauthorised by either
NSC or Central Intelligence.

234
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,670
Covert ops often go unrecorded.

235
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,882
60% of the flights listed

236
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,128
coincide with dates
and locations

237
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,887
where verifiable
Covenant activity occurred.

238
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,392
My daughter is
a committed public servant

239
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:39,230
who, despite my objections,
insisted on government service

240
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,774
because she felt
the responsibility

241
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,690
to give back to her country.

242
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,192
I understand this is difficult.

243
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,904
No, it's not.
Because there is nothing here.

244
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,699
Lauren is a patriot.

245
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:54,074
And I will not allow you
to ruin her reputation

246
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,417
based on innuendo
and supposition.

247
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,745
As I said...

248
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,006
...my findings are preliminary.

249
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,505
These are duplicates.

250
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,469
If, after reviewing them
more thoroughly,

251
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,509
you have any questions, call me.

252
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,514
Based on the transponder codes
Sloane gave us,

253
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:14,978
Marshall tracked
the Omnifam trucks

254
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,352
to the Russian consulate
at Gaborone.

255
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,978
The consulate general,
Petr Berezovsky,

256
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,107
has strong ties to The Covenant.

257
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,651
Upon your arrival, there'll be
a state event in progress.

258
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,613
You will proceed
to the second floor,

259
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,950
where we believe Sark and Bomani
may be analysing the map.

260
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,195
The second floor
of the consulate

261
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,281
is like a vault.

262
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,995
Satellite-resistant shielding.
Copper-lined walls.

263
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,663
Electrically conductive
concrete.

264
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,545
This is where you think
the map is located?

265
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,374
How do we gain access?

266
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,873
Sydney will be going in
as a Russian couture designer

267
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,248
interested in the local
diamond trade.

268
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,716
Vaughn, you and Weiss
will run backup.

269
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,925
Marshall's analysing the
security system and passwords.

270
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,472
He will brief you
on countermeasures and op-tech.

271
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,518
You leave in one hour.

272
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,479
Okay, Mountaineer.
Comms are hot.

273
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,446
I'm entering the party.

274
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,202
Copy.
Now locate Berezovsky.

275
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,956
I see him.

276
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,420
Firing up the microphone.

277
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,458
This choker will get you
to the second floor,

278
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,301
because the elevator controls
are password-operated by voice,

279
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,544
so you're gonna have
to talk like Berezovsky.

280
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,547
I designed a high-resolution
miniature microphone

281
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,968
that I placed inside
of the choker.

282
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,928
The password is "mockingbird."
In Russian.

283
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,561
That will be easy
to get him to say.

284
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,594
You won't have to.

285
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:42,140
I designed a voice-construction
software program

286
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,356
that will allow you to
reconstruct the password

287
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,196
once Sydney gets Berezovsky to
say enough phonemes.

288
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,688
Piece of cake, right?

289
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,407
I'm Paulina Alexandrova.

290
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:52,821
Yes, Madison Avenue.

291
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,788
This guy sounds like a frog.
Is this thing gonna work?

292
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,171
I don't know.
We'll find out.

293
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,762
On my way in, Syd.

294
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,089
I'll reconstruct the password
and have it uplinked

295
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,674
by the time
you reach the elevator.

296
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,141
Okay, stay sharp.

297
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,554
Sark and Bomani
could be upstairs.

298
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,356
With our computer scan
of the map,

299
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,359
we have narrowed our search
to a radius of 100 square miles.

300
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,236
The rendering should
pinpoint the location

301
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,528
by this time tomorrow.

302
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,857
Well done.
Thank you.

303
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,913
The guards are doing
a 2-minute sweep.

304
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,798
Bomani and Sark might be
in the building.

305
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,754
The elevator will take you
to the second floor.

306
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,466
You might run into
Sark and Bomani.

307
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,714
It's no good.

308
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,015
Got it.
Let me try something.

309
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,100
Gun.

310
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,725
Try it now.

311
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,099
No, it's still red.

312
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,521
Watch it. Got a guard
approaching from the south.

313
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,992
I think I got it.
Try again.

314
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,955
We're on our way up.

315
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,129
You will go to Vienna
and get everything ready.

316
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,454
I will meet you there,
and we'll retrieve the key.

317
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,126
Very well.

318
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,264
Well, that was extravagant.

319
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:43,222
I trust no one, Mr. Sark.

320
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,303
And it is best
you remember that.

321
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,066
There it is.

322
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,485
We're in.
Whoa, whoa!

323
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,657
It looks like you
triggered a silent alarm.

324
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,908
Get the crystal and get out.

325
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,920
Yes?

326
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,630
Somebody's here.

327
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,426
Got it.

328
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,217
Go!

329
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,660
Take my gun.

330
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:56,549
We're going over.

331
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,380
- Ready?
- Ready.

332
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:14,987
They have the crystal.

333
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,147
I'll get them.

334
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,122
The Covenant may have
discovered how to read this.

335
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,750
Even if we figure out
where it leads,

336
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,577
Bomani may get there first.

337
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,461
Dixon forwarded the picture
of the crystal

338
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:32,661
on to Project: Black Hole.

339
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:36,290
I'll call and ask if they have
the device that can read it.

340
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,302
Lauren and I are separating.

341
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:54,277
When we get home,
I'm on Weiss' couch.

342
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,698
Are you sure that's
what you really want?

343
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,867
It is.

344
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:34,854
Can I help you, Ms. Reed?

345
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,603
Run a check
against a user account.

346
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:39,530
Number DY692.

347
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,907
I'm sorry.
Those records are sealed.

348
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,736
I have S.C.I.
Ievel-nine clearance.

349
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,701
You can check
with the office of security.

350
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,409
- Protocol.
- I understand.

351
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:51,290
Here we go.

352
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,378
Jack Bristow accessed my files.

353
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:59,501
My intrusion-detection program
logged his user account.

354
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,048
What information was
he interested in specifically?

355
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,260
My travel itinerary
for the last five months.

356
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:05,889
Expense reports,
rental car receipts.

357
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,254
My phone logs.

358
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,177
I can't risk being exposed.

359
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,641
Well, then I strongly
suggest you reconsider

360
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,018
eliminating your father.

361
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,898
How will that help
this situation?

362
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,605
We can associate him
with the breaches.

363
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:22,360
If you have another suggestion,
now is the time to make it.

364
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,314
Good.

365
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,695
Then we're agreed.

366
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,744
It operates under

367
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,625
the same principles
as a kaleidoscope.

368
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,166
It contains loose pieces
of coloured glass

369
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,876
reflected by mirrors
set at certain angles

370
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,671
that create patterns when viewed
through the end of the tube.

371
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,255
In this case,
the pattern is a map.

372
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,219
Made up of three crystals.

373
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,512
All of which are required
to properly read the map.

374
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,676
Sloane had collected only two.

375
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:52,892
Now that we have all three,
what does the map look like?

376
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,019
Check it out.

377
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:56,898
Do we know where that is?

378
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,308
I ran the image through
every known land chart.

379
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:02,189
I adjusted for erosion,
acid rain, natural disaster.

380
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,739
I couldn't find a match.

381
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:04,903
The map revealed nothing?

382
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,316
Not to me, sir.
Sorry.

383
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,617
Based on your intel,
we were able to acquire

384
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,531
what we were looking for
from Bomani.

385
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:13,331
I'm happy I could help.

386
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,198
The problem is,

387
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:17,542
we can't interpret
the data it generated.

388
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,296
Excellent.

389
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:26,509
"The Iliad."

390
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,469
So, how may I be of service?

391
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,940
You found the third crystal.

392
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,817
Thank you.

393
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,604
Tell us what you see.

394
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:53,160
Rambaldi encrypted
many of his discoveries.

395
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,706
Or divided them into pieces

396
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,875
so that if the authorities
discovered any single piece,

397
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:01,579
the true meaning of his work
would not be revealed.

398
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:03,381
That's true of the crystals.

399
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,589
And the keys they lead to.

400
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:07,504
- Keys?
- Disks, to be precise.

401
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:11,379
There are four disks that
fit perfectly into the slots

402
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,099
carved into the Rambaldi box.

403
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,889
We know the crystals are a map.
We don't know to where.

404
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:17,687
What you've been
looking at doesn't sync up

405
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,432
to any known topography.

406
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:21,102
You know better
than anyone, Sydney.

407
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,687
There isn't anywhere on Earth

408
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:24,604
that Rambaldi
or his followers wouldn't go

409
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:27,187
to hide one of his creations.

410
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:30,781
We've looked
everywhere on Earth.

411
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:33,953
Really, Marcus?
Have you?

412
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:38,205
Or is it simply that you've
looked everywhere on land?

413
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:41,128
Okay, now this
is what I was looking at.

414
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,956
It's your basic land mass.

415
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:43,878
But then...

416
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:48,960
if I compare the topography
with oceanic mapping...

417
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,756
Sloane is a genius.

418
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,008
I mean,
an evil, horrible genius.

419
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,478
Bad man.

420
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:58,937
But still a genius.

421
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,857
The Yonaguni rock formation
off the coast of Okinawa.

422
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,566
I want you two
in flight immediately.

423
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,644
There's time to spec out
the mission en route.

424
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:09,153
Op-tech will be waiting for you
when you land.

425
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:10,648
Senator Reed called.

426
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,948
He's reviewed the documents
and wants to meet.

427
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:15,527
We owed him the courtesy
of informing him in advance.

428
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,164
As soon as your conversation
is complete,

429
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:21,032
we need to inform the FBI
and have her taken into custody.

430
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:32,005
Hello, Father.

431
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:35,473
I didn't hear you come in.

432
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:38,678
I've been here a while
talking to Mom.

433
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,846
Shut the door.

434
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,806
There's something
we need to discuss

435
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,308
that I don't want
your mom to hear.

436
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:49,357
She's a great woman, your mom.

437
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,191
Put up with a lot.

438
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:52,693
Me being away.

439
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,240
Congress all these years.

440
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,324
It's a burden.

441
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,986
Don't think I don't know it.

442
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:01,240
On you, too.

443
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,750
It'd break your mother's heart

444
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:07,253
if she ever found out
about this.

445
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:13,300
I know because it broke mine.

446
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,010
If it's any consolation,

447
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,433
I believe the cause
I am working for is just.

448
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,019
I feel like I let you down.

449
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:28,568
Like it's my fault,

450
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,776
and that if I help you
get out of it,

451
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:35,075
we could start over somehow.

452
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,493
Get out of it?

453
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,156
I could tell the Agency

454
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:43,411
I had learned there was a mole
in the Rotunda six months ago,

455
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:48,744
and that I've been conducting
my own investigation.

456
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,291
I'm a Senator
on the Intelligence Committee.

457
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,876
No one would say a word.

458
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,846
You would do that for me?

459
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,139
Of course I would.

460
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:09,272
I love you.

461
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:16,774
It's a clever plan,
and I'll definitely use it.

462
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:20,821
However, it only solves
one of my problems.

463
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:24,704
Lauren, what are you doing?

464
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:28,285
Get on your knees.

465
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,411
You can't do this.

466
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:31,747
Get on your knees.

467
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:35,841
Hands behind your head.

468
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:38,930
Do as I say!

469
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:43,678
Lauren, please, don't do this.

470
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:57,444
God, what are you doing?

471
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,407
Give me the gun, Lauren.

472
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:13,464
Sark said you might back out.

473
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:22,549
Send them up.

474
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,058
I'm so sorry.

475
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,768
Tell me what happened.

476
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:20,364
I'd been out shopping,
and I...

477
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:23,869
I came back, and...

478
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:26,195
George was there.

479
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:29,740
He was just sitting,
gazing out the window.

480
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,957
He started talking,

481
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:34,370
saying something
about our country.

482
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:37,085
That our government
was ineffectual.

483
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:41,042
He said he'd made
certain choices.

484
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:45,807
That when they came out,
no one would understand.

485
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:50,104
I told him
whatever was going on...

486
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:53,899
...we could get through it.

487
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:57,519
He said Lauren
would be implicated, too,

488
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:59,854
that he'd asked her
to do things...

489
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:03,946
I don't know,
access records on his behalf.

490
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:06,989
I went to the kitchen,
and that's...

491
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,369
That's when I heard the shot.

492
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:14,871
I mean, I'm his wife.

493
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:16,872
I should have known.

494
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:21,546
These people
he was talking about.

495
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:22,881
The Covenant.

496
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:28,178
He made it sound like
they were terrorists.

497
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:31,473
Mom.

498
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:34,018
Oh, my God.

499
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:38,108
I'm sorry.

500
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:14,434
Alright, Mountaineer,
just course 6 degrees southwest.

501
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:28,775
Target acquired.

502
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,539
They'll be out of radio contact
until they resurface.

503
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,053
What is this place?

504
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:52,679
Looks like it's been
fortified over the years.

505
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,560
Probably by the followers
of Rambaldi

506
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:57,813
to protect his artefacts
from ever being removed.

507
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:01,102
Well, next time they'll have to
do a better job.

508
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:02,605
What's that?

509
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,940
I'm not sure.

510
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:06,110
What is that?

511
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:07,824
Hold on a second.
I'll enhance.

512
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:11,275
It's a helicopter.

513
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,162
With divers.
Four of them, sir.

514
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,371
Syd, Vaughn.
You've got four incoming bogeys.

515
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,000
I repeat, four bogeys.
Do you copy?

516
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:19,754
As long as they're in that cave,
the signal's down.

517
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:23,252
These never have to
see the surface.

518
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:24,088
What do you mean?

519
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:26,631
If what's in the Rambaldi box
is a danger to you,

520
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,593
and these keys are the only
way to open it,

521
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,886
maybe they should be destroyed.

522
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:33,510
Thank you for saying that.

523
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:37,719
Put down your weapon.

524
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:43,940
I could never have found these
without your help.

525
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:46,698
I thank you for that.

526
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:49,616
You remind me of your mother.

527
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:51,575
I'm sure she would be
pleased to know

528
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:53,203
I got the keys from you.

529
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:57,831
After all,
The Passenger is Irina's legacy.

530
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:01,413
Bring me the satchel.

531
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:44,958
Bomani's got the keys.

532
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:48,792
Vaughn, our hose has been cut.

533
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:50,000
The DPV's shot.

534
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:52,087
How long can you hold
your breath?

535
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,173
A free swim?

536
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:56,175
No way. We'd never make it
out of the tunnel.

537
00:32:56,267 --> 00:32:57,512
It's too far.

538
00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:59,096
We don't have a choice.

539
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:01,559
There's got to be something
in here we can use.

540
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:02,679
There.

541
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,105
The tank's full.

542
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:09,864
The regulator's broken.
It's compressed air.

543
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:11,905
If we could release it properly,

544
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:14,280
it can act
as a propulsion device.

545
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:23,333
Hang on.

546
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:32,836
There they are.

547
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:34,092
How can you be sure?

548
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,632
The tracker they're wearing
emits a specific GPS frequency.

549
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:01,905
Nothing on the satellite feed
or from Naval Intelligence.

550
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,827
It's like Bomani
just disappeared.

551
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:07,003
And took the key
to The Passenger with him.

552
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,130
Vaughn.

553
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:21,644
I am sad for you.

554
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:23,519
For you and Lauren.

555
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:26,689
That you have to go
through this.

556
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,269
But I'm also hopeful.

557
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:36,899
That's what scares me.

558
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:42,738
I understand.

559
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:58,889
When we get home...

560
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:06,600
...you want to get
a cup of coffee?

561
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:14,150
Yeah.

562
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:17,107
I want to extend my condolences

563
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,236
on behalf of
the entire task force.

564
00:35:20,328 --> 00:35:21,703
Thank you.

565
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:24,361
I have arranged
to make grief counselling

566
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:25,738
available at your convenience.

567
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:28,918
And a leave of absence
should you want one.

568
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:32,671
What's this?

569
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:36,382
My letter of resignation.

570
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:40,676
My actions violated the oath
I took to this country

571
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:43,303
and your trust.

572
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:46,474
Agents were put at risk
because of what I did.

573
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:48,223
Your behaviour,
while unacceptable,

574
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:50,521
is nevertheless understandable.

575
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:53,609
You were acting
at your father's instruction

576
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:54,940
in accordance
with what you believed

577
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,939
was approved
government protocol.

578
00:35:57,032 --> 00:36:00,151
He told you he was conducting
an independent security check,

579
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:03,030
and you had no reason
to believe otherwise.

580
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:12,833
Many of us have suffered tragedy
on the job or at home.

581
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:16,256
When that happens,
we pull together.

582
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:20,924
This time will be no exception.

583
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:23,256
Your resignation
is not accepted.

584
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:26,973
Now, if you'll excuse me,

585
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:29,849
I'd like to go
and find my husband.

586
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:35,894
Did the forensics check out?

587
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:37,185
Yes.

588
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,316
The official cause of death
was suicide.

589
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:43,449
Do you accept that?

590
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:46,158
At this point,
I have no reason not to.

591
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:47,991
I assume this means
we no longer have reason

592
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:49,874
to hold Sloane.

593
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,461
Not necessarily.

594
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:17,710
You are here because we believed
you hacked into this office

595
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:20,169
and removed classified files.

596
00:38:20,258 --> 00:38:22,749
We were wrong.

597
00:38:22,844 --> 00:38:25,928
And those charges
are being dropped.

598
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,472
So, am I to understand

599
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,727
that you have apprehended
the mole?

600
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:35,272
Yes.

601
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:38,057
Senator George Reed.

602
00:38:39,986 --> 00:38:42,857
George Reed admitted
to working for The Covenant?

603
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:44,821
He did.

604
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:48,030
And then he killed himself.

605
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:53,446
I wish to be released
immediately,

606
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:56,079
with apologies,

607
00:38:56,169 --> 00:38:58,078
and my pardon agreement intact.

608
00:38:58,171 --> 00:39:00,709
I'm sure you would.

609
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:04,463
But in going through
the senator's personal effects,

610
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:07,090
we discovered evidence that,
for the past year,

611
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,845
he has been consulting with you
regarding Rambaldi's work.

612
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:13,507
And, further,
that in direct violation

613
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:15,014
of your pardon agreement,

614
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:16,896
you handed over certain
Rambaldi artefacts

615
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:18,606
not to the DSR,

616
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:21,443
but directly
to the senator himself.

617
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:24,066
As a result,
we have been given authority

618
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:27,987
to officially revoke
your pardon agreement.

619
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:30,781
Meaning the sentence
you received

620
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,322
prior to the agreement
is being reinstituted.

621
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:37,665
In two weeks...

622
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:42,205
...you'll be executed
by lethal injection.

623
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:04,068
- Hello?
- Hi.

624
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:05,731
Hi.

625
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:09,357
I'm sorry about how
I got pulled away earlier.

626
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:10,861
How is she?

627
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:14,535
It's hard, dealing with
her father's death and betrayal.

628
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,583
Are you at Eric's?

629
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:23,744
No.

630
00:40:27,802 --> 00:40:29,961
I see.

631
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:39,261
Well, I guess we won't be
getting that cup of coffee.

632
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:42,939
No, we're not.

633
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:46,524
Okay, I'm going to go.
