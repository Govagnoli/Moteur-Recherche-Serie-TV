1
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:18,086
What is going to happen with my family?

2
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:20,953
My orders are to deliver you
to the airfield.

3
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:23,021
I have no information beyond that.

4
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:24,388
Could you find out?

5
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:27,631
Wha...

6
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:29,031
What's happening?

7
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,698
Why are we stopped?

8
00:00:34,991 --> 00:00:36,741
It's all right. We're on our way.

9
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,065
Oh! They're here!

10
00:00:49,164 --> 00:00:51,179
- I'm going.
- God, they're here!

11
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,712
Charlie-Echo-One, this is Foxfire.
We're under attack.

12
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,363
Don't shoot!

13
00:01:09,713 --> 00:01:10,717
I'm coming out!

14
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:18,278
Don't sh...

15
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:20,388
Oh, God! Ohh!

16
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:33,876
Irina...

17
00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:36,560
You've compromised our agenda, Jeffrey.

18
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:37,512
No, I...

19
00:01:37,513 --> 00:01:38,748
I didn't do anything.

20
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:40,153
This is all a mistake!

21
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:42,507
Okay, I'm sorry!

22
00:01:42,984 --> 00:01:43,984
I'm sorry!

23
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,972
Tell me exactly what you said
to my husband.

24
00:01:47,568 --> 00:01:49,285
Did you tell him about the Horizon?

25
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:50,637
No, of course not!

26
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:52,912
No! You have to believe me!

27
00:01:52,954 --> 00:01:53,994
I swear!

28
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:56,294
I do believe you.

00:02:11,123 --> 00:02:13,314
Sorry to keep you waiting,
agent Bristow.

33
00:02:14,192 --> 00:02:16,544
I know Langley's anxious to debrief you.

34
00:02:19,442 --> 00:02:20,442
Is my baby okay?

35
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:23,052
Yes.

36
00:02:25,302 --> 00:02:26,302
You're sure?

37
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:28,709
I can't imagine what you went through
on that ship.

38
00:02:28,747 --> 00:02:30,226
But having said that,

39
00:02:30,663 --> 00:02:33,448
the surgery they performed
probably saved the pregnancy.

40
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:37,698
You and your child are in great health,
agent Bristow.

41
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:39,834
Well, thank you.

42
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:42,482
And call me Sydney.

43
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:45,145
If you're going to deliver this baby
in the next couple of weeks,

44
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:47,175
we might as well
get to know each other.

45
00:02:48,194 --> 00:02:49,180
Hi.

46
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,917
They told me you were done?

47
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:54,311
See you next week.

48
00:02:56,053 --> 00:02:57,170
Is everything okay?

49
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:58,303
Yeah, I'm fine.

50
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:00,459
Hey, can I borrow your phone?

51
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,995
- I want to get Marshall...
- the C.I.A. released your father.

52
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:03,907
They did?

53
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:05,084
Davenport confessed.

54
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:06,783
Apparently he cut a deal.

55
00:03:06,982 --> 00:03:09,927
Your father wants to see us,
before you contact A.P.O.

56
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:12,215
Where is he?

57
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,490
Thanks.

58
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:17,938
Hey.

59
00:03:18,188 --> 00:03:19,188
Hey, what's up?

60
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,686
- You want to go for a walk?
- Yeah.

61
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:27,820
Rain check.
I'll... find you when I'm done.

62
00:03:27,948 --> 00:03:29,659
...authority here is no way in question.

63
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,757
This is merely temporary...

64
00:03:30,758 --> 00:03:32,463
Of course. I understand that.

65
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:34,510
Davenport and I came up together.

66
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:36,787
- I'm godfather to his oldest son.
- Yeah.

67
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:38,524
How were these people able
to corrupt him?

68
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:39,365
I have no idea.

69
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:41,639
Agent Tom Grace,
this is director Devlin.

70
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:43,420
The director and his team
will be auditing

71
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:44,837
our investigation of Prophet Five.

72
00:03:44,838 --> 00:03:46,861
You'll assist him, please
with whatever he needs.

73
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:48,234
- Sure, of course.
- Thank you.

74
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,997
I'd, uh, for starters, like to see
all your sit reports and...

75
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:52,998
operation files.

76
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:54,546
I can get you the sit reps,

77
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:57,359
but we're performing diagnostic
on the computer network.

78
00:03:57,453 --> 00:03:58,907
The files will take longer.

79
00:03:59,026 --> 00:04:00,437
It's... it's just routine.

80
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:04,194
Who can provide me with
admin privileges to your access logs?

81
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:05,724
That's... Rachel Gibson.

82
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:07,343
She's over there.

83
00:04:07,894 --> 00:04:08,894
Thank you.

84
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,119
What just happened?

85
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,212
He wants to review
the computer transmissions

86
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:21,271
to see if anyone provided Prophet Five
with Davenport's travel route.

87
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:24,583
He thinks the leak
came from this office,

88
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:27,089
and the phone logs
will reveal who it was.

89
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:28,916
Apparently so.

90
00:04:58,314 --> 00:05:00,171
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

91
00:05:00,622 --> 00:05:03,129
Okay, what's going on?
Why are we meeting out here?

92
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:04,536
Davenport's been killed.

93
00:05:04,876 --> 00:05:06,464
His transport was ambushed.

94
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:08,784
That transport route was classified.

95
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:10,978
- The only people who knew...
- Were C.I.A.

96
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,078
You think Prophet Five has another mole
inside the agency?

97
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,079
It seems so, yes.

98
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:17,939
There's more.
As a condition of my release,

99
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,399
director Devlin is insisting
we suspend our investigation

100
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,659
of Prophet Five until Langley's
had a chance to review our findings.

101
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,660
We can't do that.

102
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,468
I agree, which means as long as Devlin
maintains a presence inside A.P.O.,

103
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:30,645
we have to stop documenting our work.

104
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,141
Operations will be compartmentalized
to senior staff only.

105
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,413
When I came to see you in the hospital,
you wanted to tell me something...

106
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:39,438
the reason Prophet Five abducted you.

107
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,823
When I was on their ship,
before the operation,

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,191
they performed some kind
of regression therapy.

109
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:47,133
They wanted me to remember a cipher...
Leo 47 Norte.

110
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,637
It was an entry on an Alliance
organization chart

111
00:05:50,638 --> 00:05:52,256
Vaughn showed me years ago.

112
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:54,139
And did you give them the intel?

113
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:55,416
I changed the phrase.

114
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:56,417
That's good.

115
00:05:56,827 --> 00:05:57,872
"47 Norte"?

116
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:03,146
That's a territorial designation.
It refers to France.

117
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:05,532
"Leo" designates a specific mission.

118
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,515
I'll review the Alliance archives.

119
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:09,380
Someone on that mission
might still be alive.

120
00:06:09,386 --> 00:06:10,693
I want you on a plane to Paris.

121
00:06:10,716 --> 00:06:13,608
Assuming I'm successful,
you'll be in position to act quickly.

122
00:06:13,643 --> 00:06:15,365
Make contact with Renée Rienne.

123
00:06:15,414 --> 00:06:16,494
Ask her to provide Dixon

124
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:18,848
with whatever documentation
he may need once he arrives.

125
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:19,679
Okay.

126
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:21,448
Then I want you to go home
and pack a bag.

127
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,256
- I'm moving you to a secure location.
- No.

128
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,641
- It's just temporary.
- Dad, don't be silly.

129
00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:28,693
- I want to help.
- Help, yes, I know.

130
00:06:29,198 --> 00:06:31,065
For now, you need to go underground.

131
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:34,516
Prophet Five abducted you.
We can't risk them doing it again.

132
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:44,660
Don't blame your dad, Syd.

133
00:06:44,731 --> 00:06:46,613
He's only trying to protect you.

134
00:06:46,913 --> 00:06:47,981
Yeah.

135
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:49,134
What?

136
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:51,809
Do you remember what Dean said?

137
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,098
That Prophet Five had plans for me.

138
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,751
They saved this baby for a reason.

139
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Why?

140
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:03,052
I don't know.

141
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:07,020
Maybe that's why Jack wants you
in a safe house.

142
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:08,315
I can fend for myself.

143
00:07:08,822 --> 00:07:10,720
But you're not just fending
for yourself.

144
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,072
You're fending for two.

145
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,603
And let's be honest, Syd.

146
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,267
Right now you waddle.

147
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,752
- I don't waddle.
- Oh, yes, you do.

148
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:23,882
I'll admit I may be a little less
graceful,

149
00:07:23,962 --> 00:07:25,079
but I don't waddle.

150
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:27,607
You're right.

151
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:31,666
Actually, it's more of a teeter.

152
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,690
Hello, Sydney.

153
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,990
Mom.

154
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:05,137
You look beautiful.

155
00:08:10,582 --> 00:08:11,740
I'm here now.

156
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:15,219
Everything is going to be fine.

157
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,070
Mom...

158
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,790
I am so glad you're here.

159
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,989
Believe me, there's no one else
I want to go through this with,

160
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,041
but...

161
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:34,852
it isn't safe.

162
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,599
- Sydney...
- No.

163
00:08:37,495 --> 00:08:39,951
Mom, we're involved
in an investigation.

164
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,648
The C.I.A. Is everywhere.

165
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:44,534
- If they find out that you're even--
- I know about Prophet Five.

166
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,380
I know they abducted you.

167
00:08:49,883 --> 00:08:51,517
That's the reason I've come.

168
00:08:54,753 --> 00:08:56,723
They've been rumored
for over 30 years...

169
00:08:56,724 --> 00:09:00,371
an organization so secret
most of us thought they were a myth.

170
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,741
Then six months ago,

171
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,859
a contact of mine told me
they'd become active again,

172
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:09,551
that after all this time
they'd finally found someone

173
00:09:10,502 --> 00:09:14,146
who they believed could lead them
to what they'd been looking for.

174
00:09:14,228 --> 00:09:16,024
The reason they came together--

175
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:19,937
to pursue something they call
"the Horizon."

176
00:09:25,444 --> 00:09:26,813
You've never heard of it?

177
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:28,193
No.

178
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,733
Prophet Five believes you have.

179
00:09:32,053 --> 00:09:34,053
They believe you know where it is.

180
00:09:40,376 --> 00:09:41,670
What are you thinking?

181
00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:44,590
When Prophet Five abducted me,

182
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,725
they tried to get me to reveal
information

183
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:49,524
about an old Alliance mission.

184
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:51,268
What was the mission?

185
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,863
Well, I don't know the details,

186
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,158
just the code name.

187
00:09:56,711 --> 00:09:58,299
But dad is looking into it.

188
00:09:59,362 --> 00:10:00,597
You told your father?

189
00:10:02,562 --> 00:10:03,562
That's good.

190
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:06,367
How's Jack?

191
00:10:07,822 --> 00:10:08,822
He's good.

192
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:14,269
Prophet Five killed Vaughn.

193
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:16,682
I know.

194
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,010
I'm so sorry.

195
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:31,320
It was an Alliance mission...

196
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:33,116
designation Leo 47 Norte.

197
00:10:33,225 --> 00:10:34,722
"47 Norte," got it.

198
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,321
All Alliance files are backed up
on Langley's archives.

199
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:40,557
Can you do it without being traced
back to this office?

200
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:43,479
So Devlin can't find out about it?

201
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,974
Sure, I can use a proxy
to spoof the origin.

202
00:10:51,221 --> 00:10:52,809
I love secret conspiracies.

203
00:10:53,398 --> 00:10:55,584
You know, as long as
I'm a co-conspirator.

204
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:00,483
Okay, here it is.

205
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:04,142
Operation originating back in 1999,

206
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,112
coordinated by a Jean Bertrand.

207
00:11:06,242 --> 00:11:07,947
Let me see if I can find him.

208
00:11:09,226 --> 00:11:10,545
You know, back in high school,

209
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:12,304
we took apart
my calculus professor's car

210
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:13,853
and reassembled it in his classroom.

211
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,052
Actually, my friends did it.

212
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:17,034
I would have helped,
but they couldn't trust me.

213
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,370
Said I had loose lips, which is,
you know, ridiculous.

214
00:11:19,393 --> 00:11:21,431
- Hey, Marshall.
- Uh, nothing!

215
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:23,701
We're not doing anything.

216
00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:24,731
Yes?

217
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:27,049
The diagnostic on the server,
tell me when it's done.

218
00:11:27,123 --> 00:11:28,123
You got it.

219
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,022
Thanks.

220
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,258
Good to see you, Tom.

221
00:11:31,344 --> 00:11:32,647
That is unexpected.

222
00:11:34,482 --> 00:11:35,776
I'll be there shortly.

223
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:36,931
Was that Syd?

224
00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:40,502
Well, your voice-- it modulates a little
when you're talking to sydney.

225
00:11:40,537 --> 00:11:41,700
Is everything okay?

226
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,448
What do you have on Bertrand?

227
00:11:43,742 --> 00:11:45,644
Right. Secret.

228
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:52,099
Okay, latest intel
places Bertrand in Paris.

229
00:11:52,164 --> 00:11:55,140
Okay, forward the intel to Dixon.
He's joining up with Renée.

230
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:56,241
Use tac-3.

231
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,526
I don't want it
going through A.P.O.'S servers.

232
00:11:58,561 --> 00:11:59,571
Got it.

233
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,270
She still here?

234
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
Jack...

235
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:22,240
you look...

236
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,010
well.

237
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:27,986
I got your messages. I wanted to reply.

238
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,894
But I sensed it might be a C.I.A. trap.

239
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,620
Look at us,

240
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,375
about to become grandparents.

241
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,471
I'm doing my best to ignore that.

242
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:42,234
Did Sydney tell you?

243
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:45,801
I fear for her safety.

244
00:12:46,818 --> 00:12:47,818
Yes, she did.

245
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:50,362
Did Dixon find out anything?

246
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:54,566
Not yet, but he's with a source now.

247
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:19,702
Bonsoir, Jean.

248
00:14:29,793 --> 00:14:30,779
Thanks.

249
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,421
No, I'll take it from here.

250
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:34,182
That was Dixon.

251
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,040
He couldn't confirm what the Horizon is,

252
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,343
but we know
it's in a safe deposit box in Vancouver.

253
00:14:38,366 --> 00:14:39,388
The Queen's bank.

254
00:14:39,773 --> 00:14:41,030
We need to act fast.

255
00:14:41,154 --> 00:14:43,112
Prophet Five has probably
figured out by now

256
00:14:43,147 --> 00:14:44,862
I gave them the wrong information.

257
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:46,686
Yeah, that's a safe assumption.

258
00:14:46,763 --> 00:14:47,880
We can't use A.P.O.

259
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:49,560
Devlin's men are everywhere.

260
00:14:50,226 --> 00:14:52,226
If you're being watched, I can go.

261
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:54,426
I have contacts in Vancouver.

262
00:14:58,683 --> 00:15:01,475
We'll go together,
retrieve the Horizon ourselves.

263
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:03,536
Can your contacts
make the travel arrangements?

264
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:05,595
Make 'em for three. I'm going, too.

265
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:08,664
I know what you're going to say.
You're worried about my safety.

266
00:15:08,665 --> 00:15:10,503
It's a 3-hour flight, a bank.

267
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:12,327
- We'll be in and out.
- Sydney...

268
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,504
Listen, the Horizon is why
Prophet Five killed Vaughn.

269
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:17,522
It's why they kidnapped me.

270
00:15:17,893 --> 00:15:22,078
If we can get it before they do,
we can finish this thing, for good.

271
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,493
Make the arrangements.

272
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,240
Peyton!

273
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:40,173
We just got a message
from Irina Derevko.

274
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:41,624
The Horizon is in Vancouver.

275
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,507
She's on her way to retrieve it.

276
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:46,073
Assemble a team. We're going, too.

277
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:48,555
You question Derevko's loyalty?

278
00:15:48,684 --> 00:15:52,625
No, I don't, but I'm not willing
to take the chance that I'm wrong,

279
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:54,473
now when we're this close.

280
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,861
Mr. And Mrs. Visconti,

281
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:12,582
my apologies but the bank is closing.

282
00:16:13,197 --> 00:16:17,095
Perhaps we can find another time
to endow your grandchild's trust fund.

283
00:16:17,096 --> 00:16:18,286
My daughter is never late.

284
00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:19,954
It's that clown she married!

285
00:16:20,017 --> 00:16:22,308
Of course, darling,
it's never our angel's fault.

286
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:23,365
Papa!

287
00:16:23,713 --> 00:16:24,922
Mama. I'm sorry I'm late.

288
00:16:25,228 --> 00:16:26,437
Sorry, sorry.

289
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:31,905
Where is Roberto?

290
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,525
He's not coming.

291
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:35,774
He says he doesn't want your money.

292
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:38,766
Papa,
it is his job to provide for our baby.

293
00:16:38,894 --> 00:16:41,653
And how does he expect
to provide for my grandchild?

294
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:43,423
- He's a clown!
- He is an artist.

295
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,642
Brigitte, we agreed that the trust fund

296
00:16:45,694 --> 00:16:48,430
would be a safety net
in case things don't work out.

297
00:16:48,496 --> 00:16:50,100
But they will. We love each other.

298
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:54,437
Of course, the two of you will be
as happy as your father and I have been.

299
00:16:55,706 --> 00:16:57,006
Let us do this for you.

300
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:58,007
Let us help.

301
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,505
Okay, for the baby.

302
00:17:03,734 --> 00:17:08,305
Signore, we would be grateful if you
could assist us with the deposit now.

303
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:10,871
I'm sorry, but it's too late.

304
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:17,226
Here is a cashier's check
drawn on the trust account.

305
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,862
That is a very generous amount.

306
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,476
He said "no," my darling.

307
00:17:22,477 --> 00:17:24,085
Bank Lissor is open until 6:00.

308
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:27,188
- Maybe if we hurry, we can...
- That won't be necessary.

309
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:32,669
It would be a privilege to help
you plan for your family's future.

310
00:17:32,979 --> 00:17:34,343
I have a daughter myself.

311
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:38,461
Then you know that it's a parent's job
to take care of their children.

312
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:39,806
Mama...

313
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:50,716
Is now a good time for that rain check?

314
00:17:50,717 --> 00:17:52,011
Yeah, sure. What's up?

315
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:54,951
I know about Alan Korman.

316
00:17:56,947 --> 00:18:00,452
I know that you broke
into witsec to find him,

317
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:02,233
that he killed your wife.

318
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:07,228
Please promise me that you're not
going to do anything stupid,

319
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,141
that you're not going after him.

320
00:18:12,263 --> 00:18:13,263
I already did.

321
00:18:14,698 --> 00:18:15,933
I saw him last night.

322
00:18:18,637 --> 00:18:20,695
I followed him to a parking garage.

323
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,390
I watched him get out of his car.

324
00:18:26,762 --> 00:18:28,056
And then there he was.

325
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,818
I was 10 feet away from the man
that killed my wife.

326
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,921
Then I watched his wife
get out of the car

327
00:18:41,964 --> 00:18:43,372
and their little son.

328
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:46,927
And I watched his life.

329
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:51,536
And then I just walked way.

330
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,237
I mean, killing him...

331
00:18:57,072 --> 00:18:59,248
it's not going to bring back my wife.

332
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,189
No, it won't.

333
00:19:05,948 --> 00:19:07,889
I should have told you about her.

334
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:11,978
I guess we just we get so comfortable...

335
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:14,420
keeping secrets around here.

336
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,836
And congratulations.

337
00:19:25,448 --> 00:19:26,448
Thank you.

338
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:30,386
Papa, if Roberto finds out,
he'll be very angry.

339
00:19:30,387 --> 00:19:32,387
Then it will be our family secret.

340
00:19:32,762 --> 00:19:35,387
We'll find a place
to keep the trust documents safe.

341
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:37,771
Perhaps il Signore Moreau can help us.

342
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:40,390
Do you have a safety deposit we can use?

343
00:19:40,456 --> 00:19:41,323
Of course.

344
00:19:43,073 --> 00:19:44,778
Everything all right, my dear?

345
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:45,889
Yes, it's just...

346
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:48,140
your grandchild keeps kicking me.

347
00:19:48,763 --> 00:19:50,340
You had a very busy day.

348
00:19:50,513 --> 00:19:53,066
Would you mind if our daughter
waited here?

349
00:19:53,513 --> 00:19:54,513
Not at all.

350
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:56,056
If you'll follow me...

351
00:20:00,714 --> 00:20:03,010
It's so sweet how your daughter
wants to please you.

352
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:04,561
She's our pride and joy.

353
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:06,484
I'm sure she'll be a wonderful parent

354
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,885
- to her own child.
- Thank you.

355
00:20:07,886 --> 00:20:10,003
She has two such lovely role models.

356
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:18,261
Excuse me.

357
00:20:19,699 --> 00:20:20,782
<i>Hey, Tom, I need your help.</i>

358
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:21,947
Hey, dad.

359
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,622
- What's going on?
- Backdoor into a secure database.

360
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,647
These are the files right here.

361
00:20:27,764 --> 00:20:30,309
Yeah, I know.
Computers are tricky. You're right.

362
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,952
I'm going to put you on the phone with
our tech support. Her name's Rachel.

363
00:20:34,013 --> 00:20:36,428
She'll be able to help you out. Hold on.

364
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:40,687
Hey, my dad's on the phone.
He kind of needs your help.

365
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:44,978
We've taken great pains to ensure
the security of this facility.

366
00:20:45,388 --> 00:20:50,625
In fact, we pride ourselves on being
too careful with our clients' assets.

367
00:20:51,578 --> 00:20:52,754
That's good to hear.

368
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,451
Rachel,
it looks like 512-bit encryption.

369
00:20:56,484 --> 00:20:58,433
<i>I can open a port
if you need to run a program.</i>

370
00:20:59,153 --> 00:21:00,731
That's okay. I think I got it.

371
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:05,340
What about emergency response?

372
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:10,062
If an alarm is tripped, how long before,
the authorities respond?

373
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:12,076
The building
has round-the-clock security.

374
00:21:12,077 --> 00:21:15,253
Our drills place it at four minutes,
but to be honest,

375
00:21:15,502 --> 00:21:16,788
it's never been activated.

376
00:21:16,938 --> 00:21:17,889
Good.

377
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:19,866
Let's keep it that way.

378
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:23,441
Syd, we've got him.

379
00:21:23,564 --> 00:21:24,573
<i>What's the box number?</i>

380
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:25,691
Wait. Hang on, dad.

381
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,669
Try this. 8438220.

382
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:37,199
Someday you have to show me
how you do that.

383
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,261
A magician never reveals her secrets.

384
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,377
- Be safe.
- Thanks.

385
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:47,404
Okay, dad, box 135.

386
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:31,863
I can't open it.

387
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:33,049
Why?

388
00:22:33,236 --> 00:22:35,802
A countermeasure.
Looks like it's acid-based.

389
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:38,630
- Can you disable it?
- Not without the combination.

390
00:22:38,696 --> 00:22:40,513
It'll destroy the contents.

391
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:43,381
I'll have to take it back to Marshall.
He'll be able to...

392
00:22:45,052 --> 00:22:46,254
Peyton's here.

393
00:22:51,331 --> 00:22:52,505
Talk fast!

394
00:22:53,802 --> 00:22:55,154
They're here as backup.

395
00:22:55,176 --> 00:22:57,293
You're working for them, aren't you?

396
00:22:57,613 --> 00:22:58,613
Answer me!

397
00:23:01,238 --> 00:23:03,939
That was you... on the ship.

398
00:23:05,413 --> 00:23:06,352
Wasn't it?

399
00:23:07,048 --> 00:23:08,869
Behind the glass.

400
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,329
You orchestrated the whole thing...

401
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:13,845
because you wanted this.

402
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:16,277
And when...

403
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,025
when you couldn't torture it out of me,

404
00:23:19,026 --> 00:23:20,673
you came to me as my mother.

405
00:23:21,903 --> 00:23:23,154
I am your mother.

406
00:23:26,087 --> 00:23:27,792
Call off your team right now.

407
00:23:27,838 --> 00:23:30,061
- They're not my team.
- I don't believe you.

408
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,914
- Dad...
- You need to believe me.

409
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:35,399
'Cause if Peyton's here,
she's here to kill me, too.

410
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,739
She's going to be very disappointed,
because I'm about to beat her to it.

411
00:23:38,905 --> 00:23:40,656
I thought I killed you once.

412
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:42,902
This time I'll be more thorough.

413
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:43,903
Hey, dad!

414
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,772
The baby's coming.

415
00:24:00,153 --> 00:24:01,211
We have a problem.

416
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:05,192
Devlin's men
are accessing our server logs.

417
00:24:05,707 --> 00:24:07,398
They believe there's a mole
within A.P.O.

418
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:10,147
responsible for leaking
information to Prophet Five.

419
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:11,689
You think they're right?

420
00:24:13,592 --> 00:24:14,592
No, I don't.

421
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:18,776
However, Sydney and Jack
are in the field without clearance.

422
00:24:18,777 --> 00:24:20,247
I've been assisting them.

423
00:24:20,277 --> 00:24:21,213
So have I.

424
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:22,484
Yes, I know.

425
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:26,192
I've already tried purging
the logs myself,

426
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:27,673
but the files are read-only.

427
00:24:29,463 --> 00:24:30,463
I can do it.

428
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:32,402
I can crack the logs
and delete the entries,

429
00:24:32,403 --> 00:24:35,461
make it untraceable,
but it will take a little time.

430
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:37,185
Then get to it right now.

431
00:24:38,818 --> 00:24:39,900
You should sit.

432
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,531
Look, we need to get out of here.

433
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:45,946
What's their approach?

434
00:24:46,217 --> 00:24:47,217
What?

435
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,594
Their plan, what is it?
How are they going to attack us?

436
00:24:49,714 --> 00:24:52,615
I don't know. I already told you,
this wasn't part of my operation.

437
00:24:54,964 --> 00:24:56,081
You want to escape?

438
00:24:56,964 --> 00:24:58,140
Give me the Horizon.

439
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,480
- I'll tell them you're already gone.
- That isn't going to happen.

440
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:03,620
Jack, don't be stubborn.
The baby's coming.

441
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,386
I'm trying to help.

442
00:25:08,205 --> 00:25:09,675
I'm giving you a way out.

443
00:25:21,393 --> 00:25:22,391
Okay, I'm in.

444
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:24,568
We've got control of their system.

445
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:25,703
Can you see them?

446
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:28,351
The bank
has its own dedicated security feed.

447
00:25:28,455 --> 00:25:30,767
If they enter any of the stairwells,
I'll see them.

448
00:25:30,768 --> 00:25:32,411
Lock down the building. We're going up.

449
00:25:34,828 --> 00:25:36,475
How were you going to do it?

450
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:39,637
Once you took the Horizon,
what was your extraction?

451
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,377
Look, they're coming!

452
00:25:45,517 --> 00:25:47,811
How were you going to get away from us?

453
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:50,698
There's a helicopter.
It's waiting for my signal.

454
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,574
Does Prophet Five know about it?

455
00:25:54,207 --> 00:25:57,388
The elevators will all be grounded.
It's four flights of stairs to the roof.

456
00:25:57,454 --> 00:25:58,454
I can make it.

457
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:00,207
Move!

458
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,174
Peyton, I've got a visual.

459
00:26:03,203 --> 00:26:04,203
Go ahead.

460
00:26:04,332 --> 00:26:07,269
They've just entered the main stairwell,
15th floor.

461
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,917
But they're not coming down.

462
00:26:09,456 --> 00:26:10,573
<i>They're heading up.</i>

463
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:13,019
The helipad...

464
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:16,016
redirect those cameras
to exterior surveillance.

465
00:26:16,017 --> 00:26:18,152
<i>I'm going to keep going.
I'm six floors behind.</i>

466
00:26:19,642 --> 00:26:21,759
What's the signal to the helicopter?

467
00:26:22,018 --> 00:26:23,018
A beacon.

468
00:26:24,581 --> 00:26:25,581
It's in my bra.

469
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:32,206
Keep moving.

470
00:26:35,643 --> 00:26:36,760
We're almost there.

471
00:26:51,581 --> 00:26:54,143
I've got a chopper approaching inbound
from the northwest.

472
00:26:54,144 --> 00:26:55,144
Damn!

473
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,830
Out here.

474
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:22,345
Quickly!

475
00:27:53,225 --> 00:27:55,087
This building has to have
a freight elevator.

476
00:27:55,143 --> 00:27:57,153
- Sydney...
- If we hot-wire a junction box,

477
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:59,869
we might be able to restore
emergency power to one of the cars.

478
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,770
Even if we could,
they'll be waiting for us

479
00:28:01,836 --> 00:28:04,221
- as soon as we override the elevator.
- We have to try.

480
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:06,708
We need to set up a defensive position.

481
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:09,111
I'm not interested in your opinion.

482
00:28:09,803 --> 00:28:10,803
She's right.

483
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:13,153
Even if we could outflank them
down the stairwell,

484
00:28:13,154 --> 00:28:14,114
you wouldn't make it.

485
00:28:14,437 --> 00:28:15,460
Here,

486
00:28:16,348 --> 00:28:17,503
cover your mother.

487
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:20,225
I'll go down and take care
of Peyton and her men.

488
00:28:20,427 --> 00:28:21,544
I'll be right back.

489
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:25,182
Whatever happens,
keep that pointed at your mother.

490
00:28:25,183 --> 00:28:26,418
If she even blinks...

491
00:28:26,684 --> 00:28:27,684
I'll shoot her.

492
00:28:30,554 --> 00:28:31,554
Okay, I'm in.

493
00:28:32,021 --> 00:28:35,020
- The logs are online.
- Have they found anything yet?

494
00:28:35,077 --> 00:28:37,204
No, they're still working
on the tasking logs.

495
00:28:37,205 --> 00:28:39,105
I'm going to start
with the comm entries.

496
00:28:39,212 --> 00:28:39,950
Here we go.

497
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:42,635
This is Sydney's communication
from Vancouver.

498
00:28:43,275 --> 00:28:45,922
And Paris,
this is Dixon's pbx communication.

499
00:28:46,272 --> 00:28:47,248
Okay, I think that's it.

500
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:49,384
- Nothing else looks...
- No, there's one more.

501
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:52,084
I had to pull satellite imagery
for the building in Vancouver.

502
00:28:52,085 --> 00:28:53,490
We'll have to delete that as well.

503
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:57,049
Time stamp should be somewhere
between midnight and 2:00am.

504
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:00,315
There.

505
00:29:01,183 --> 00:29:02,996
"Tindle" isn't your log-in name.

506
00:29:02,997 --> 00:29:04,938
No. My network account timed out.

507
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:06,876
I had to create a temporary one.

508
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,428
- I can't do it.
- What do you mean?

509
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,086
They're on the same page of entries.

510
00:29:13,087 --> 00:29:15,617
That's them now.
If we delete this one, they'll see it.

511
00:29:23,497 --> 00:29:24,842
- Devlin.
- It's me.

512
00:29:25,245 --> 00:29:27,431
It seems you don't have
the latest server logs.

513
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,843
What's the time stamp
on your last entry?

514
00:29:30,057 --> 00:29:31,821
Scroll to the end of the list.

515
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:38,155
10:37 this morning.

516
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:42,901
Okay, it matches up.

517
00:29:43,186 --> 00:29:44,891
Sorry about the interruption.

518
00:29:47,373 --> 00:29:48,373
Good work.

519
00:29:55,686 --> 00:29:57,038
"The truth takes time."

520
00:29:58,122 --> 00:29:59,945
That's what you said years ago.

521
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:04,601
Is this what you meant?

522
00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:08,719
You like it to be simple.

523
00:30:11,508 --> 00:30:12,720
It's never simple.

524
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:20,159
Did you put out the order
to kill Vaughn?

525
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:34,877
I'd known about his investigation
for a long time.

526
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,257
In sovogda I tried to warn him.

527
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:41,529
He didn't take my advice.

528
00:30:42,497 --> 00:30:43,497
I fell for you.

529
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:46,765
Even dad fell for you.

530
00:30:49,496 --> 00:30:51,201
But Vaughn never trusted you.

531
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:18,866
This is Alpha team. We're on 16.

532
00:31:19,122 --> 00:31:20,651
We have a possible target.

533
00:31:21,122 --> 00:31:22,122
Copy that.

534
00:31:49,836 --> 00:31:50,953
Alpha team, report.

535
00:31:52,147 --> 00:31:53,558
Alpha team, do you copy?

536
00:31:56,212 --> 00:31:57,506
Barker, where are you?

537
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,815
I just swept 17. Moving on to 18.

538
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
Roger.

539
00:32:02,271 --> 00:32:04,035
Finish up there and report in.

540
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:09,958
Exhale through your mouth.

541
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:13,008
- I'm only offering advice.
- Don't!

542
00:32:16,022 --> 00:32:18,022
I know why you saved my pregnancy.

543
00:32:19,613 --> 00:32:22,824
You want my baby, and I don't know why.

544
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:25,192
Frankly, I don't care.

545
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:27,899
I just want you to leave us alone.

546
00:32:30,469 --> 00:32:32,469
You should know something, Sydney.

547
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,293
I never wanted to have a child.

548
00:32:39,034 --> 00:32:40,386
The K.G.B. demanded it.

549
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:45,059
They knew it would ensure
your father's allegiance to me.

550
00:32:47,157 --> 00:32:49,425
You were simply a means to an end.

551
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,215
And then when the doctor
put you in my arms,

552
00:32:55,216 --> 00:32:56,290
and I looked at you,

553
00:32:58,886 --> 00:32:59,947
so fragile,

554
00:33:02,597 --> 00:33:03,873
all I could think was,

555
00:33:03,874 --> 00:33:06,773
"how could I have made
such a terrible mistake?"

556
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,558
And at that moment,
I was sure of one thing.

557
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,900
I couldn't be an agent and a mother.

558
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:17,537
I'd rather fail at one or both.

559
00:33:22,308 --> 00:33:24,543
And I chose to fail at being a mother.

560
00:33:29,871 --> 00:33:30,871
Give me the gun.

561
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,736
Syd, they're coming.

562
00:33:53,884 --> 00:33:55,048
In time you'll learn

563
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:57,128
you can't do both.

564
00:33:57,686 --> 00:33:58,686
Watch me.

565
00:34:16,499 --> 00:34:20,204
The only reason I saved the baby
is because you're my daughter.

566
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:23,266
Now do exactly as I tell you.

567
00:34:23,426 --> 00:34:24,744
Get in that chair.

568
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,121
This really is no place for you,
grandpa.

569
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,552
By the way, where's Sydney registered?

570
00:34:53,272 --> 00:34:55,600
I'd love to get her a gift for the baby.

571
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,777
Sydney, don't push!

572
00:35:38,964 --> 00:35:40,265
God, mom, I have to!

573
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,354
No, listen to me!

574
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,907
Don't push.

575
00:35:45,104 --> 00:35:46,166
I know you want to,

576
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:48,232
but you can't.

577
00:35:48,588 --> 00:35:49,823
Sydney, listen to me.

578
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,450
The baby is coming out backward.

579
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,826
What does that mean?

580
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,038
What is it?

581
00:35:57,085 --> 00:35:59,507
Her muscles are locked.
She needs to relax.

582
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,661
The baby needs oxygen
if it doesn't come out right now.

583
00:36:02,777 --> 00:36:03,777
Squeeze my hand.

584
00:36:04,902 --> 00:36:05,960
This is important.

585
00:36:06,462 --> 00:36:07,579
As hard as you can.

586
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,526
- Dad!
- Just keep breathing.

587
00:36:10,714 --> 00:36:11,714
Breathe.

588
00:36:12,854 --> 00:36:13,709
Okay, good.

589
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,952
In and out.

590
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:17,846
Okay, now again.

591
00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:19,722
Look at me.

592
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:22,912
You can do this.

593
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,854
I can't, dad. I can't!

594
00:36:26,629 --> 00:36:27,779
Yes, you can.

595
00:36:28,439 --> 00:36:30,144
I don't want to do this here!

596
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,517
That's okay.
Tell me where you want to be.

597
00:36:33,313 --> 00:36:34,313
I'm scared.

598
00:36:34,364 --> 00:36:36,711
I know. That's why we're here
to take care of you.

599
00:36:36,749 --> 00:36:38,665
Now tell me where you want to be.

600
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,912
I want to be on a beach.

601
00:36:40,936 --> 00:36:41,994
That's good, okay.

602
00:36:42,377 --> 00:36:43,377
Just go there.

603
00:36:43,562 --> 00:36:44,797
Now tell me about it.

604
00:36:46,873 --> 00:36:47,931
Vaughn is with me.

605
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:50,668
Vaughn is there, with you on the beach.

606
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,376
Good.

607
00:36:52,562 --> 00:36:53,679
Vaughn is with you.

608
00:36:54,188 --> 00:36:55,188
I miss him.

609
00:36:55,563 --> 00:36:56,563
I know.

610
00:36:57,754 --> 00:36:59,283
I know you do, sweetheart.

611
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,250
It's okay.

612
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:02,674
You're gonna be okay.

613
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:04,477
Okay now, Sydney, push.

614
00:37:05,002 --> 00:37:06,413
Sydney, you can do this.

615
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:10,596
Now, again.

616
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,187
Push.

617
00:37:12,811 --> 00:37:14,399
Sydney, as hard as you can!

618
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:18,559
Good!

619
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:31,042
You have a baby girl.

620
00:37:52,316 --> 00:37:54,450
- She took the satchel.
- I know.

621
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,806
We'll find her.

622
00:37:59,882 --> 00:38:00,882
Sweetie...

623
00:38:05,441 --> 00:38:06,558
She's so beautiful.

624
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,553
<i>Listen to me very carefully,
Marshall.</i>

625
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:20,861
<i>Jack and Sydney are in Vancouver,
Queen's bank.</i>

626
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,445
<i>They need extraction.</i>

627
00:38:22,587 --> 00:38:26,030
Okay, is this who I think it is?

628
00:38:26,586 --> 00:38:29,692
Tell the team they'll need diapers.

629
00:38:43,585 --> 00:38:44,879
I just spoke to Dixon.

630
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,489
He's in contact
with Europol and the S.V.R.

631
00:38:48,022 --> 00:38:49,022
So far, nothing.

632
00:38:50,146 --> 00:38:51,498
We'll find her, Sydney.

633
00:38:58,398 --> 00:39:00,868
Would you like
to hold your granddaughter?

634
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:02,961
Yes, I would.

635
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:21,054
She has Vaughn's eyes.

636
00:39:22,056 --> 00:39:23,056
Yeah, she does.

637
00:39:30,482 --> 00:39:31,482
Dad...

638
00:39:38,298 --> 00:39:39,533
I'll take care of it.

639
