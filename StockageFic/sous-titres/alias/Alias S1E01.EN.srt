1
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:53,314
Sydney, time's up.

2
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:55,566
OK.

3
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,279
Then I'll... just... finish

4
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:02,865
my... little... essay.

5
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,203
Thank you.

6
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:23,052
- I'm sure I got a D.
- You didn't get a D.

7
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:26,722
I got a D, I think I got a 64.

8
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:30,267
- You've never gotten a D.
- I've gotten a D.

9
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,770
High school, Home Ec.
Remember the...

10
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,689
Yeah, what did you do?
Embroider a T-shirt?

11
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:40,402
- Sweatshirt, that was my assignment.
- It was obscene, about the teacher?

12
00:02:40,486 --> 00:02:43,197
That sexist pig.
I deserved a scholarship.

13
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,866
- Wait. Hold on.
- This time, I deserve a D.

14
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,328
I didn't prepare,
I didn't... have enough time.

15
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:52,915
We've had this conversation.
Quit the bank.

16
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:54,750
What are you doing?

17
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:58,712
I can't go through double shift
again holding on to this.

18
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,801
- Did you get Dave Matthews tickets?
- Will you stand up, please?

19
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:10,099
I wanted to wait, maybe do it
at the weekend, but...

20
00:03:10,182 --> 00:03:12,601
- I couldn't.
- What's going on?

21
00:03:12,685 --> 00:03:17,106
Remember our first date?
The bowling alley?

22
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:20,818
- The loud guy?
- Oh, God.

23
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,903
Build me up

24
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:26,323
Buttercup, baby,
then you bring me down

25
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,576
And mess me around

26
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:30,661
And then worst of all

27
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,539
You never call, baby
when you say you will

28
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:37,376
But I love you still, I need you

29
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:39,587
More than anyone, darling

30
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,756
I know that I'm yours
from the start

31
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,801
Build me up, buttercup

32
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:49,179
Don't break my heart

33
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:51,348
Shut up!

34
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:57,313
Sydney, I can't tell you how much
I hope you'll marry me.

35
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,609
Despite what I just did.

36
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:11,577
Yes.

37
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:20,878
Yes.

38
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,005
I love you.

39
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:29,595
- Oh, Fran.
- I know. I cry at every damn thing.

40
00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:33,015
Let me see it again.
Oh, honey, it's beautiful.

41
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:38,562
- I know. I'm getting married.
- You're getting married.

42
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:44,151
- So, d'you tell Will yet?
- I'm meeting him if you wanna come.

43
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:49,156
No. I've got 300 orthopaedic surgeons
to feed, and no desire to exercise.

44
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,284
- What about your dad?
- I haven't told him yet.

45
00:04:52,368 --> 00:04:54,620
I don't want him to ruin this.

46
00:04:54,703 --> 00:04:57,957
- Not this, you know?
- Yeah, I think you're right.

47
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,252
If you call him,
he's gonna let you down.

48
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:04,171
Yeah, I know.

49
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:07,967
Your mom would be so happy for you.

50
00:05:09,385 --> 00:05:12,179
- You know that?
- She would.

51
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:15,599
Maybe I should call my dad.

52
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:18,978
Unless you're talking about
importing airplane parts,

53
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:22,273
that man has nothing to say.
Let him get the invitation.

54
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:26,026
It's exporting airplane parts.
He already knows.

55
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,488
Danny called him to ask permission.

56
00:05:29,572 --> 00:05:31,782
Danny called your dad? Your dad?

57
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:34,618
And how did that go?

58
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,829
Yeah?

59
00:05:36,912 --> 00:05:39,206
- Oh, Mr Bristow?
- Yes.

60
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,375
Hi, it's Danny Hecht.

61
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:45,379
Sydney's boyfriend.

62
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:48,173
- Is Sydney all right?
- Oh, yeah, she's fine.

63
00:05:48,257 --> 00:05:50,634
Nothing to worry about.

64
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:54,388
I'm calling because I'm planning on
asking Sydney to marry me,

65
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:57,850
and I was hoping
to get your approval.

66
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:01,937
- Danny, let me ask you a question.
- Sure.

67
00:06:02,021 --> 00:06:04,398
How well do you know my daughter?

68
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:07,026
We've been dating for two years.

69
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:11,822
If you need to ask me about this, I
have a sense you don't know Sydney.

70
00:06:12,156 --> 00:06:16,076
I love your daughter, I want
to marry her. That's why I'm calling.

71
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,080
First of all, the truth is,
this is just a courtesy call.

72
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:25,127
Like saying to a neighbour, "We're
having a party, if that's all right."

73
00:06:25,211 --> 00:06:28,839
What you really mean is,
"We are having a loud party."

74
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:30,841
Mr Bristow...

75
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:33,719
Sydney doesn't give a damn
what my opinion is.

76
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:36,388
What interests me is that you do.

77
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:40,351
It's just a custom to call
the father, that's all this is.

78
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:44,939
I'll tell you what. I may become
your father-in-law, that's fine,

79
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:50,110
but I will not be used as a charming
anecdote you tell your friends,

80
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:54,782
so they can see what a quaint
old-fashioned guy Danny really is.

81
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:58,369
Are we clear?

82
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,246
Yes, sir.

83
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:02,331
Good.

84
00:07:02,414 --> 00:07:04,833
Then welcome to the family.

85
00:07:39,577 --> 00:07:41,328
You're in late.

86
00:07:41,412 --> 00:07:43,497
Sorry. Executive elevator.

87
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:47,126
Come on, man, drop me off at 12.
All right. Damn...

88
00:07:49,044 --> 00:07:53,382
- Zachary feeling better?
- Much, yeah. Thanks.

89
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,055
See ya.

90
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:36,133
God, I hate this.

91
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:39,887
If only Ramadan Abadallah Shallah
still taught in Tampa.

92
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,806
Not my case work.
These new headsets pinch.

93
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,100
Give it to me. Any word from Declan?

94
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:48,062
Not since Tehran.
I'm telling myself he's fine.

95
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:50,856
He's done this before.
Disappeared for days.

96
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,900
- What's with you?
- Nothing. Why?

97
00:08:52,983 --> 00:08:55,903
- You've got, like, a glow.
- I don't have a glow.

98
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:58,155
Yeah, look at that!

99
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:01,367
- Here. Come on. There's no glow.
- Is she glowing?

100
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,202
- Big time.
- You hear that?

101
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:06,789
Yes. Better. Good.

102
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:09,166
Oskar Müller was killed last month.

103
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,212
He was riding a moped
and was hit by an ambulance.

104
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:16,006
We had kept an eye on this guy
for some time.

105
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,884
He fancied himself
a modern day alchemist.

106
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:21,512
His IQ was one of the highest
on the planet.

107
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,597
But he was riding a moped.

108
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:27,726
There was a frenzy to recover
Müller's notebooks and experiment,

109
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,021
but none were found,
at least not by the West.

110
00:09:31,105 --> 00:09:35,818
Cultural affairs building, Taipei,
Hsincheng North Road, section two.

111
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:39,071
This building is also
an FTL cover station.

112
00:09:39,154 --> 00:09:42,658
We received word that one of
Müller's plans surfaced here.

113
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:45,160
- Who's the mole?
- Antonio Quintero.

114
00:09:45,244 --> 00:09:47,079
This is his last transmission.

115
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:50,499
Uplink was on the 15th,
brush pass scheduled for Tuesday.

116
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,209
Quintero did not show.

117
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:56,380
- What is that, hieratic?
- Good try. Actually, it's demotic.

118
00:09:56,463 --> 00:10:00,926
Notes in ancient languages was one
of Müller's quirks. He had a few.

119
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,637
- Quintero's been burned?
- We don't know.

120
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:08,017
The Ambassador's throwing
a reception next Tuesday.

121
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,313
You fly to Taiwan on Monday.
You're employed by Modira Plastics.

122
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:15,024
Looking for
a new manufacturing plant.

123
00:10:15,107 --> 00:10:18,193
Based on the notes,
you'll case the east wing,

124
00:10:18,277 --> 00:10:20,154
measurements, lock specs, IO.

125
00:10:20,237 --> 00:10:24,366
Locate the lab where the plans
are being held and come home.

126
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,871
That's all. No retrieval.
We can't risk it. OK, Marshall, go.

127
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:30,789
Yeah. Thank you.

128
00:10:30,873 --> 00:10:33,834
OK. How is everyone? Good?

129
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:38,464
Alright. The first... thing...
I have here is a...

130
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:43,594
Well, looks like a lighter.
Something to light a cigarette,

131
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:48,390
but actually it's an RF scrambler.
It disrupts any video for 420 yards.

132
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:54,605
If I were to hit this switch,
the whole block would be in panic.

133
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:57,316
What the hell, right? Yep.

134
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,153
You see?
Everyone's totally freaking out.

135
00:11:01,237 --> 00:11:04,823
"What's going on? My computer,
my DVD's not working."

136
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:07,993
And we're back. OK.
I got a 20 volt cell in here,

137
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:10,496
so you only get
four minutes of charge.

138
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:15,584
So, you wanna get in,
do a thing, then get out.

139
00:11:15,668 --> 00:11:19,630
Four minutes two seconds
and your f... screwed. OK.

140
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:24,760
The other thing I got here...
This is good. You're gonna like this.

141
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:27,263
It's something I'm excited about.

142
00:11:27,346 --> 00:11:32,059
Looks like lipstick, you know,
something you'd do for your lips.

143
00:11:32,142 --> 00:11:35,312
You see? In the woman's...
Refresh or something.

144
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:40,276
But... This is the amazing thing.
It actually takes pictures,

145
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:45,281
and it measures space
in three axes from one vantage point.

146
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:47,950
It assembles images based on GPS,

147
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:52,288
and creates an accurate blueprint
of any building, but that's not...

148
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:56,458
It's got a camera, a short-pulse
laser, plus a grid analyser.

149
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:58,627
I got it to 42 snaps right now,

150
00:11:58,711 --> 00:12:02,798
but I wanna get it to 47,
cos that's a prime number.

151
00:12:03,424 --> 00:12:05,718
You might think this is simple,

152
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:10,890
but until we know about Quintero,
we assume the enemy's waiting.

153
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:13,642
So I want you to do us a favour.

154
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:15,936
Come back.

155
00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:32,912
- Good run.
- Thanks.

156
00:12:34,705 --> 00:12:38,876
So, where were you last night?
I called you.

157
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,795
Oh, yeah.
I don't wanna talk about it.

158
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:45,049
My sister set me up on a blind date.

159
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:47,760
Was it good?

160
00:12:47,843 --> 00:12:50,471
- For the date it was.
- You didn't like her?

161
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:53,182
Not so much.
I don't like my sister any more.

162
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:56,393
That's the problem
when siblings live with you.

163
00:12:56,477 --> 00:13:00,356
They make you meet people
you aren't supposed to meet in life.

164
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:04,151
- Why was the date so bad?
- Her favourite movie of all time?

165
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:07,154
Are you ready for this? Pretty Woman.

166
00:13:07,238 --> 00:13:10,491
So? I'm sure
it's a lot of people's favourite.

167
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:15,079
That's probably true, but
of all time? That includes like...

168
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:17,998
Well, every other movie ever made.
All of 'em.

169
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:20,793
You see Lawrence of Arabia's
at the Egyptian?

170
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:22,878
- Yeah, I did.
- You wanna go?

171
00:13:22,962 --> 00:13:25,714
- I'd love to, but...
- Danny's working late.

172
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:28,717
- I'm taking him dinner.
- We can go to a late one.

173
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:32,888
- It's only playing on Thursday.
- We're getting married.

174
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:41,438
Look at that, you're wearing a...

175
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:44,984
You're wearing a ring.
I didn't even see it. That's...

176
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:48,153
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

177
00:13:51,532 --> 00:13:54,410
- You wanna get a couple more laps?
- I'm done.

178
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:56,662
OK, I'm gonna get a couple more.

179
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:47,755
I called Todd. They haven't rented
that place yet if you wanna go look.

180
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:57,014
Impossible, isn't it?

181
00:14:57,097 --> 00:15:00,267
One day,
there's gonna be a baby in there.

182
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:04,188
My patients would love that.

183
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:09,026
Knowing that their doctor still can't
believe women can get pregnant.

184
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:41,100
Get undressed.

185
00:15:54,697 --> 00:15:57,241
I work for the CIA.

186
00:16:01,954 --> 00:16:03,455
Sydney...

187
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,463
I'm an operations officer
for the CIA.

188
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:05,661
It was during the fall
of my freshman year.

189
00:18:05,744 --> 00:18:11,166
A man approached me. He told me
the US Government might talk to me

190
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,878
about a job.

191
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:21,302
When I asked why me, all he told me
was that I fit a profile.

192
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:30,811
I didn't feel I belonged anywhere,
even at college,

193
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:33,272
and I needed the money anyway.

194
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:36,942
So, I met with him,
and they offered me a job.

195
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:40,863
A job with the CIA?

196
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,159
Not exactly. It's...

197
00:18:47,036 --> 00:18:49,872
It's a covert branch.

198
00:18:49,955 --> 00:18:51,916
This is crazy.

199
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:56,337
OK, OK. So, covert branch.
Then what?

200
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,883
After the first month, I asked if
I could test for agent training.

201
00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:06,680
The test was easy.

202
00:19:06,764 --> 00:19:13,646
They said I was a natural. Maybe
I was because I advanced quickly.

203
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:16,649
It was exciting.

204
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:19,026
This isn't real.

205
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:21,195
Danny.

206
00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:28,160
Since my mother died, I've always
hoped that I'd find someone

207
00:19:28,244 --> 00:19:30,371
to give my life meaning.

208
00:19:30,454 --> 00:19:34,708
That person is you.
I just met the agency first.

209
00:19:37,002 --> 00:19:39,588
I can't quit.

210
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:42,800
Syd, I love you.

211
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:45,928
But this...

212
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:50,391
I've... I've just gotta figure out
what I'm thinking.

213
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,689
You can't tell anyone about this.

214
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:58,899
About what I do.

215
00:19:58,983 --> 00:20:01,110
No-one.

216
00:20:01,193 --> 00:20:03,445
- I...
- Danny, I'm not kidding.

217
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:05,781
I got it.

218
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:10,411
I need a... I need to walk.
I'll call you tonight.

219
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:14,373
I've got my trip.

220
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:18,919
San Diego?

221
00:20:19,003 --> 00:20:21,005
I'll call you when I get back.

222
00:20:22,673 --> 00:20:24,758
Be careful.

223
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:49,158
You know, Sloane doesn't like it.

224
00:20:49,992 --> 00:20:53,329
- That you're still in grad school.
- I know.

225
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:58,751
He'd rather none of us have
a life outside. I'm not giving it up.

226
00:21:00,294 --> 00:21:02,379
You all right?

227
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:09,762
How long have you and Diane
been married?

228
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:13,390
11... No, 12 years. Damn.

229
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:18,020
You love her?

230
00:21:18,103 --> 00:21:20,522
Of course I do.

231
00:21:20,606 --> 00:21:24,026
- And you never said a thing?
- About what?

232
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:27,154
About what we do.

233
00:21:27,238 --> 00:21:31,951
Diane is married to an investment
analyst who loves his job.

234
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:39,833
- I'm protecting her from the truth.
- And you don't...

235
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:44,338
You don't feel like
you're lying to her?

236
00:21:44,421 --> 00:21:46,840
If there's one rule you don't break,

237
00:21:46,924 --> 00:21:49,426
that's the rule you don't break.

238
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:54,932
It must just get easier, after.

239
00:23:06,253 --> 00:23:10,341
- Hey, this is Sydney.
- This is Danny. I don't live here.

240
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:12,760
Leave a message. I'll call you back.

241
00:23:12,843 --> 00:23:15,930
Thank you.
She meant to say thank you.

242
00:23:16,013 --> 00:23:22,102
You're not there. Well, I know
you're not there or in San Diego.

243
00:23:30,528 --> 00:23:33,322
You could be anywhere,
doing anything.

244
00:23:37,493 --> 00:23:41,413
Which is...
Which is the crux of the issue.

245
00:23:57,555 --> 00:23:59,348
Can I live like this?

246
00:24:00,391 --> 00:24:04,353
Not knowing where,
or why, or when?

247
00:24:11,986 --> 00:24:15,447
Can I live in the dark?

248
00:24:15,531 --> 00:24:17,533
And the answer...

249
00:24:17,616 --> 00:24:20,870
The only answer
I came up with, Syd, was...

250
00:24:24,456 --> 00:24:26,458
...was yes.

251
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:29,461
Syd, I don't care.

252
00:24:29,545 --> 00:24:32,715
The whole world's
a nightmare, anyway.

253
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,760
It's all dangerous,
no matter what we do.

254
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:43,475
I couldn't live with myself, saying
goodbye to you because of risk.

255
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:46,729
It's all a risk.

256
00:24:46,812 --> 00:24:48,689
I...

257
00:24:48,772 --> 00:24:51,317
No, the kids thing.

258
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,070
That we have to talk about
because I want kids.

259
00:24:55,154 --> 00:24:57,531
I love kids.

260
00:24:57,615 --> 00:25:01,660
But, you see,
maybe there is a way out, cos...

261
00:25:01,744 --> 00:25:04,163
People aren't spies forever.

262
00:25:04,246 --> 00:25:08,834
At some time,
people have to be able to say

263
00:25:08,918 --> 00:25:11,503
they used to be spies.

264
00:25:12,922 --> 00:25:14,381
I miss you, Syd.

265
00:25:15,132 --> 00:25:17,426
Come... Come home.

266
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,656
Yeah?

267
00:25:41,408 --> 00:25:43,494
Who?

268
00:25:45,913 --> 00:25:47,998
What else?

269
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:54,171
Yeah, well, get me
the audio right away. Yeah.

270
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:15,794
I'm so lost. Oh, my God.

271
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:18,047
I was looking for the bathroom.

272
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,591
There should be signs. In English.

273
00:27:20,674 --> 00:27:23,177
I don't know
if you're in charge, but...

274
00:27:24,762 --> 00:27:27,264
This area is restricted.

275
00:27:27,973 --> 00:27:31,101
Please, I was just
going to the bathroom.

276
00:27:31,185 --> 00:27:34,688
You don't know my boss.
If he found out I'd been drinking,

277
00:27:34,772 --> 00:27:38,526
that I'd gotten in trouble,
I swear, I will lose my job.

278
00:27:39,151 --> 00:27:41,529
I swear it.

279
00:27:48,327 --> 00:27:50,412
The rest room is this way.

280
00:27:50,496 --> 00:27:53,415
Thank you. Bless your heart.

281
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:55,709
I like your tie.

282
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:04,385
We have a breach.

283
00:28:05,427 --> 00:28:07,930
It appears Daniel Hecht
has become aware

284
00:28:08,013 --> 00:28:10,641
of Sydney's affiliation
with the agency.

285
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,442
You understand what that means?

286
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:30,452
Yes, I understand.

287
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,166
I appreciate you
telling me yourself.

288
00:28:38,627 --> 00:28:41,755
- I'm sorry, Jack.
- Don't be.

289
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:44,425
You know me well enough.

290
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:47,970
You know where my loyalty lies.

291
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:03,819
- Mr Gonzales.
- Mr Dixon. Where's Bristow?

292
00:29:04,486 --> 00:29:08,365
- Looking for this?
- Looking for her. Where is she?

293
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:11,327
- She left me at the gate.
- Left you at the gate?

294
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:15,789
Said she was grabbing a taxi.
What's the problem?

295
00:29:15,873 --> 00:29:19,877
Hey, I'm back. I didn't even
go home first. I took a cab...

296
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:36,912
What did you do?

297
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:43,419
I might ask you the same question.

298
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:49,258
Security became aware of the breach
and performed their function.

299
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:53,095
You're familiar with the codes
of conduct, Agent Bristow.

300
00:30:53,888 --> 00:30:57,099
You knew the codes applied to you,
even as you put at risk

301
00:30:57,182 --> 00:31:01,812
the lives of every man and woman
working at this agency.

302
00:31:01,896 --> 00:31:06,775
Danny wasn't a risk.
He was... He was just a man.

303
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:10,404
He was a doctor. He was just...

304
00:31:10,487 --> 00:31:15,117
Listen to me. Information about
this agency is treated like a virus.

305
00:31:15,201 --> 00:31:18,954
There is only one response.
That is containment.

306
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:21,790
You put us into
a compromised situation,

307
00:31:21,874 --> 00:31:25,419
and though I despise
that countermeasure we had to...

308
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,092
Stop saying "we".

309
00:31:32,927 --> 00:31:36,388
Stop talking about the agency.

310
00:31:36,472 --> 00:31:38,474
You killed the man I love.

311
00:31:40,267 --> 00:31:42,645
No, Agent Bristow.

312
00:31:42,728 --> 00:31:44,271
You did.

313
00:31:53,906 --> 00:31:55,366
Let me out.

314
00:31:55,449 --> 00:31:59,411
I can't imagine
how difficult this is for you.

315
00:31:59,495 --> 00:32:01,914
Let me out.

316
00:32:01,997 --> 00:32:06,752
However, before you go anywhere,
McCullough needs to see you.

317
00:32:06,835 --> 00:32:10,339
You see, you're a risk now, too.

318
00:32:14,218 --> 00:32:17,263
Are you an operative of SD6?

319
00:32:17,346 --> 00:32:19,431
Yes.

320
00:32:19,515 --> 00:32:23,602
How long have you been
an operative of SD6?

321
00:32:25,062 --> 00:32:26,939
Seven years.

322
00:32:28,774 --> 00:32:34,446
What is your identification and
classification number with SD6?

323
00:32:36,448 --> 00:32:39,493
My identification
and classification is...

324
00:32:39,577 --> 00:32:43,747
Have you ever been so entertained
by the cleverness of a crook

325
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:46,333
that you hoped he'd get away with it?

326
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:51,046
Did you reveal information
regarding SD6 to Daniel Hecht?

327
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,717
Do you ever lie? What is
your relation to Daniel Hecht?

328
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,802
Covert branch of the CIA.

329
00:32:56,886 --> 00:33:00,848
If a person is arrested for stealing
and others have helped,

330
00:33:00,931 --> 00:33:03,017
should he reveal his helpers?

331
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,935
Yes.

332
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:02,201
Wow!

333
00:34:05,788 --> 00:34:09,124
I don't know
what you put in that stuff. Wow!

334
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,506
I'd rather not
make this too painful.

335
00:34:17,049 --> 00:34:20,594
Me, too. Thanks.
Glad we're on the same page.

336
00:34:20,678 --> 00:34:22,888
That's good.

337
00:34:28,143 --> 00:34:31,021
Who are you working for?

338
00:34:33,858 --> 00:34:36,443
I will not ask you again.

339
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:41,031
OK.

340
00:34:41,657 --> 00:34:43,534
Get a pen.

341
00:34:49,331 --> 00:34:52,084
Write this down.

342
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:55,546
E... M.

343
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:59,675
E-T-l-B.

344
00:35:00,634 --> 00:35:02,219
- You got that?
- Yes.

345
00:35:02,303 --> 00:35:05,097
OK. Now reverse it.

346
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,603
BITE ME

347
00:35:20,946 --> 00:35:24,950
I've got bad news for you, man.
I am your worst enemy.

348
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:27,286
I've got nothing to lose.

349
00:35:41,717 --> 00:35:44,136
That's not exactly true.

350
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:47,598
You have teeth.

351
00:35:58,692 --> 00:36:01,904
These questions
resonate even louder,

352
00:36:01,987 --> 00:36:07,243
when you lose somebody
through a senseless act of violence.

353
00:36:08,285 --> 00:36:12,081
But we hear them,
echoing in our minds.

354
00:36:13,415 --> 00:36:15,084
Why?

355
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,821
- Hey, this is Sydney.
- And Danny. I don't live here.

356
00:38:07,905 --> 00:38:10,407
Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

357
00:38:10,491 --> 00:38:13,452
Thank you.
She meant to say thank you.

358
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:30,010
Hey, this is Sydney.

359
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:32,096
Leave me a message.

360
00:38:32,721 --> 00:38:34,598
Thank you.

361
00:38:47,778 --> 00:38:50,114
She loved a man,

362
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:52,533
and she lost him.

363
00:38:52,616 --> 00:38:55,119
This isn't a new theme in literature,

364
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:58,038
but it seems to be
one of the favourites.

365
00:38:58,122 --> 00:39:00,124
For instance,

366
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:04,211
what does Tennyson
contribute to this subject?

367
00:39:04,295 --> 00:39:08,382
His work is mildly out of fashion

368
00:39:08,465 --> 00:39:12,887
but I would like you to consider
his exploration of this theme.

369
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:16,348
It seems that...
It seems to be...

370
00:39:26,734 --> 00:39:28,611
Syd.

371
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:34,241
- Need a lift?
- No, thanks.

372
00:39:34,325 --> 00:39:36,535
I'm just going to the library.

373
00:39:38,495 --> 00:39:40,831
How've you been?

374
00:39:40,915 --> 00:39:42,917
OK. You?

375
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,336
Good. Better.

376
00:39:46,378 --> 00:39:49,256
Thanks for the flowers. It was nice.

377
00:39:50,507 --> 00:39:53,135
Look. Sloane's getting impatient.

378
00:39:53,844 --> 00:39:56,472
They gave you a month off.
It's been three.

379
00:39:56,555 --> 00:40:01,060
- I've talked to Sloane.
- Apparently not to his satisfaction.

380
00:40:01,143 --> 00:40:04,480
I know they sent you here
to bring me back. I'm sorry.

381
00:40:05,272 --> 00:40:07,608
I just can't yet.

382
00:40:07,691 --> 00:40:12,238
They got word. FTL has built
the Müller device. Sloane wants it.

383
00:40:12,321 --> 00:40:14,240
- They don't need me.
- They do.

384
00:40:14,323 --> 00:40:17,618
- Tell them to call Quintero.
- Quintero's dead.

385
00:40:18,577 --> 00:40:21,372
We got confirmation Thursday. Syd?

386
00:40:23,249 --> 00:40:26,877
They need you active,
and if they don't have confidence

387
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:29,421
in someone
who's in as deep as you are,

388
00:40:29,505 --> 00:40:31,674
they'll fix that problem.

389
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:39,056
I really am sorry.

390
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,520
- I'll see you.
- Syd?

391
00:42:53,399 --> 00:42:55,776
Hello?

392
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,946
- Francie, hi.
- Wanna hear the worst day ever?

393
00:42:59,029 --> 00:43:00,823
Could you call my cell phone?

394
00:43:00,906 --> 00:43:04,785
- I can barely hear you.
- Just call me right back.

395
00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:07,288
OK.

396
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,564
Get in.

397
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:18,150
Daddy?

398
00:44:20,569 --> 00:44:22,696
Now!

399
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:35,584
Dad, you have a gun!

400
00:44:37,253 --> 00:44:39,755
- Hello?
- I'll call you later.

401
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:42,675
I rang twice.
You won't believe the day I had.

402
00:44:42,758 --> 00:44:44,426
Me, too.

403
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:46,887
- Hang on.
- Dad, what are you doing?

404
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:20,254
There might be others.
Put your seat belt on.

405
00:45:20,337 --> 00:45:23,591
There are many things
you won't understand tonight.

406
00:45:23,674 --> 00:45:26,886
You must understand
that the agency doesn't trust you,

407
00:45:26,969 --> 00:45:29,972
and they're gonna kill you
unless you do as I say.

408
00:45:30,055 --> 00:45:32,308
I work for SD-6, just like you.

409
00:45:32,391 --> 00:45:34,560
Undercover at Jennings Aerospace.

410
00:45:36,478 --> 00:45:40,357
You leave tonight. Fly to France,
a connection to Switzerland.

411
00:45:40,441 --> 00:45:43,485
You'll be stopped at customs
so I got you new papers.

412
00:45:43,569 --> 00:45:48,032
- I thought you sold aeroplane parts.
- I don't. I never did.

413
00:45:57,166 --> 00:46:00,878
That car's taking you to the airport.
I have to get back.

414
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:02,838
- Who are you?
- Get in that car.

415
00:46:02,922 --> 00:46:06,091
In two minutes they leave,
with or without you.

416
00:46:08,344 --> 00:46:12,598
There's no time not to trust me. You
don't know who you're dealing with.

417
00:46:12,848 --> 00:46:17,102
What does that mean?
Who the hell am I dealing with?

418
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:23,609
About a decade ago,
a pool of agents went freelance.

419
00:46:23,692 --> 00:46:25,486
Russian, Libyan, Chinese...

420
00:46:25,569 --> 00:46:28,405
- The Alliance Of 12.
- What do you know of them?

421
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:31,534
They're an enemy of the US.
Mercenaries.

422
00:46:31,617 --> 00:46:37,164
I'm one of them. SD-6 is not
a black ops division of the CIA.

423
00:46:37,248 --> 00:46:39,875
SD-6 is a branch of The Alliance.

424
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:44,255
You work for the enemy
you thought you opposed.

425
00:46:44,338 --> 00:46:47,550
- That's impossible.
- Why have you not been to Langley?

426
00:46:47,633 --> 00:46:52,596
You've been lied to. All lower-level
agents have been lied to.

427
00:46:55,307 --> 00:46:57,935
I am trying to help you here.

428
00:46:58,018 --> 00:47:01,146
So you're saying
I'm working for the enemy.

429
00:47:02,398 --> 00:47:05,943
- And you are the enemy.
- Sydney, this is your last chance.

430
00:47:06,026 --> 00:47:08,112
You have to go.

431
00:47:13,784 --> 00:47:17,121
Who are you to come to me
and act like a father?

432
00:47:17,204 --> 00:47:21,584
If you wanna help me,
stay away from me.

433
00:47:40,352 --> 00:47:42,146
OK.

434
00:47:43,189 --> 00:47:45,274
Let's try one more time.

435
00:47:46,192 --> 00:47:48,652
Who do you work for?

436
00:47:50,779 --> 00:47:52,114
I...

437
00:47:59,121 --> 00:48:01,207
I just wanna say...

438
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,046
Start with the teeth in the back,
if you don't mind.

439
00:48:13,761 --> 00:48:15,846
No!

440
00:48:28,108 --> 00:48:31,237
Yeah. Wait.
Let me ask the quest... No.

441
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,156
The newspaper's doing you a favour.
Yeah...

442
00:48:34,865 --> 00:48:36,992
I'm on a counter run. Want anything?

443
00:48:37,076 --> 00:48:39,495
- No. Is Liv in?
- What do you think?

444
00:48:39,578 --> 00:48:41,872
- She still work here?
- Hope not.

445
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:50,005
Meet me on the roof? Perfect.
Some guy just totally hung up on me.

446
00:48:50,839 --> 00:48:52,925
So I got an hour. Wanna get lunch?

447
00:48:53,008 --> 00:48:56,262
- What happened to your face?
- I need your help.

448
00:48:57,388 --> 00:48:59,932
- Are you OK?
- I can't explain so don't ask.

449
00:49:00,015 --> 00:49:02,101
You just gotta trust me.

450
00:49:03,561 --> 00:49:04,812
Of course.

451
00:49:04,895 --> 00:49:08,148
I need one of your sister's
credit cards. A $3,000 limit.

452
00:49:08,232 --> 00:49:10,150
I'll pay her back. Can you get it?

453
00:49:10,234 --> 00:49:13,153
Syd, what is this? Do you
owe somebody some money?

454
00:49:13,237 --> 00:49:15,030
There's something else.

455
00:49:15,656 --> 00:49:18,576
Do you know where
Amy keeps her passport?

456
00:49:55,362 --> 00:49:58,199
How many bags
are you checking in to Taipei?

457
00:49:58,282 --> 00:50:00,910
Just this.
What's your lipstick? I love it.

458
00:50:00,993 --> 00:50:04,496
- Allex Jane Lux, Concorde Grape.
- Totally pops.

459
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,374
Thanks. May I see your passport?

460
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:10,711
Ever tried this? I think
it's too light for me. Do you?

461
00:50:12,171 --> 00:50:13,839
- It's pretty.
- Thanks.

462
00:50:13,923 --> 00:50:15,132
Window or aisle?

463
00:53:50,514 --> 00:53:53,434
The pill I gave you helps the pain.

464
00:53:53,517 --> 00:53:58,272
I could tell, because
you stopped screaming so loudly.

465
00:53:59,273 --> 00:54:01,567
That medication, however,

466
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:04,069
only lasts for two hours.

467
00:54:04,904 --> 00:54:06,697
And it's been...

468
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,657
two hours, almost.

469
00:54:10,743 --> 00:54:12,620
So...

470
00:54:13,245 --> 00:54:15,623
...you have a choice.

471
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:20,377
Which way...

472
00:54:20,461 --> 00:54:22,213
we go next.

473
00:54:31,555 --> 00:54:33,807
Tell me

474
00:54:33,891 --> 00:54:36,185
and you get one more.

475
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:39,063
The agency.

476
00:54:39,146 --> 00:54:42,650
- Louder.
- I can't.

477
00:54:45,152 --> 00:54:47,655
Who do you work for?

478
00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:51,825
You... pretty little girl.

479
00:55:28,863 --> 00:55:30,948
No... No...

480
00:57:40,327 --> 00:57:41,871
Hey, guys.

481
00:58:17,823 --> 00:58:19,742
Yeah?

482
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:24,121
Send her in. Now.

483
00:58:24,538 --> 00:58:26,832
Yeah, make sure Ravel knows.

484
00:58:59,365 --> 00:59:00,699
I'm back.

485
00:59:01,867 --> 00:59:04,995
- All right.
- I'm taking the week off.

486
00:59:06,455 --> 00:59:08,582
I've got mid-terms.

487
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:28,269
May I help you?

488
00:59:29,311 --> 00:59:32,064
I need to speak
to your director, Mr Devlin.

489
00:59:32,731 --> 00:59:36,694
I'm sorry. Mr Devlin's not
available. May I leave a message?

490
00:59:37,653 --> 00:59:40,239
Tell him he has a walk-in.

491
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:47,329
Roxanne, we have
a walk-in for Mr Devlin.

492
00:59:48,622 --> 00:59:50,457
Yes.

493
00:59:56,505 --> 00:59:58,382
Come with me, please.

494
01:00:04,263 --> 01:00:07,391
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENC Y

495
01:00:10,895 --> 01:00:13,189
- Did you do the report?
- I know.

496
01:00:13,272 --> 01:00:15,482
I'll get to it, I swear. Thanks.

497
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:22,990
There's some more coffee
and something to eat.

498
01:00:28,495 --> 01:00:31,832
Just let Mr Weiss know
if you need anything else.

499
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:34,501
A new pen. This one's dying.

500
01:00:36,545 --> 01:00:38,839
Thanks.

501
01:01:11,288 --> 01:01:14,208
- This could be interesting.
- So am I in?

502
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,628
Not yet.
They're reviewing your statement.

503
01:01:17,711 --> 01:01:20,339
- It's... You wrote a lot.
- I know.

504
01:01:20,422 --> 01:01:22,842
I mean, it's like Tolstoy-long.

505
01:01:23,551 --> 01:01:26,387
Devlin says
it could take weeks to verify.

506
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:29,932
But I know we could use
another double agent in SD-6.

507
01:01:30,558 --> 01:01:34,019
We'll be in touch. I'll get you
out of here, keep you concealed.

508
01:01:34,103 --> 01:01:36,689
- Why shake your head?
- You said "another".

509
01:01:36,772 --> 01:01:39,108
So?

510
01:01:39,191 --> 01:01:43,404
So if you had one, you wouldn't
tell me until I was authenticated.

511
01:01:43,487 --> 01:01:47,825
- Unless I had an instinct about you.
- You don't have another double.

512
01:01:47,908 --> 01:01:51,287
- We might.
- But you want me to believe you do.

513
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:55,708
So if I aim to be a triple agent,
I'll report an existing mole,

514
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:57,918
to upset the balance of my agency.

515
01:01:59,128 --> 01:02:01,839
- I'm not trying to play you.
- We'll see.

516
01:02:03,173 --> 01:02:05,176
I have an instinct.

517
01:02:13,392 --> 01:02:16,645
You need a dentist. Do you have one?
I can get you a name.

518
01:02:16,729 --> 01:02:18,939
I'm all right.

519
01:02:21,233 --> 01:02:22,693
I'll be right back.

520
01:03:15,412 --> 01:03:19,667
- I wanted to say I was sorry.
- You don't have to.

521
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:24,421
I'm back at work.
I guess you know that.

522
01:03:24,922 --> 01:03:27,091
I meant sorry about Danny.

523
01:03:28,175 --> 01:03:30,469
There was nothing I could do.

524
01:03:30,553 --> 01:03:33,514
I'd like to be alone,
if you don't mind.

525
01:03:36,934 --> 01:03:39,144
I know what it's like
to lose someone.

526
01:03:39,228 --> 01:03:43,524
I don't know what you expect.
Just because we're on the same side,

527
01:03:43,607 --> 01:03:49,238
just because I know the truth now,
it doesn't change a thing between us.

528
01:03:51,323 --> 01:03:54,243
I accept what I'm doing now
because I have to.

529
01:03:56,745 --> 01:03:59,498
That doesn't mean
I have to accept you.

530
01:04:05,713 --> 01:04:09,049
I asked Devlin
if I could come tell you myself.

531
01:04:11,552 --> 01:04:14,471
They verified your statement.
You're in.

532
01:04:17,183 --> 01:04:18,767
I read what you wrote.

533
01:04:20,102 --> 01:04:24,273
I appreciate your not naming me.
That was... kind.

534
01:04:30,112 --> 01:04:31,822
You're CIA.

535
01:04:32,615 --> 01:04:35,743
You don't know
how dangerous this is, Sydney,

536
01:04:35,826 --> 01:04:38,037
doing what I do.

537
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:41,498
I wish you'd taken me up
on Switzerland.

538
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:46,462
How do I know
what you're telling me is the truth?

539
01:04:50,341 --> 01:04:53,636
I guess we'll just have to learn
to trust each other.

540
01:05:32,049 --> 01:05:33,717
Hello?
