1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,013
Previously on Alias...

2
00:00:01,014 --> 00:00:02,864
Be awful hard
to help that daughter of yours

3
00:00:02,865 --> 00:00:04,923
from inside a federal penitentiary.

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,051
Of course, it doesn't have
to be that way.

5
00:00:07,052 --> 00:00:09,300
After careful examination of the facts,

6
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,771
Arvin Sloane,
I hereby order your release.

7
00:00:13,677 --> 00:00:15,926
The nuridium wasn't being utilized
as an explosive.

8
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:18,985
We believe it was used
to power a cryogenic chamber.

9
00:00:19,115 --> 00:00:20,115
- Hello?
- Hey.

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,784
Have you identified the body?

11
00:00:22,176 --> 00:00:24,885
The body was stolen.
I'll forward you the details.

12
00:00:24,886 --> 00:00:25,886
I'll dig around

13
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:28,908
and see what I can find out.

14
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:22,810
Kindt, we got a man down.
It's Rodriguez. Do you copy?

15
00:01:23,074 --> 00:01:25,600
Do you copy? Do you copy?

16
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:17,825
Hey.

17
00:02:17,953 --> 00:02:18,953
Hi.

18
00:02:19,136 --> 00:02:21,253
I wish I could still fit into those.

19
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:24,195
- Did you sleep okay?
- Yeah, I did.

20
00:02:28,263 --> 00:02:29,263
You okay?

21
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:33,200
I'm just... I'm telling you,
this kid's going to be a black belt.

22
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:34,436
Here, give me a hand.

23
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:35,701
Get ready.

24
00:02:40,764 --> 00:02:41,764
You, uh...

25
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,000
must be so excited.

26
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:46,834
Yeah, when I'm not terrified.

27
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,859
- You don't seem terrified.
- I am.

28
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:53,762
I have no idea how to be a parent.

29
00:02:54,013 --> 00:02:57,000
The thought of my life
changing forever...

30
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:01,903
doing it on my own...

31
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,727
it's a little overwhelming.

32
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:07,579
Yeah. I know what you mean.

33
00:03:12,516 --> 00:03:15,012
You know, you can stay here
as long as you want, Rachel.

34
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:16,013
There's no hurry.

35
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:17,453
I don't want to impose.

36
00:03:17,454 --> 00:03:19,514
We're both going through transitions.

37
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:22,526
We might as well
keep each other company.

38
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,204
Thank you.

39
00:03:26,825 --> 00:03:28,001
I'm going to change.

40
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,263
Help yourself
to anything in the fridge...

41
00:03:30,264 --> 00:03:32,013
- Okay.
- If there's anything left.

42
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:33,014
Hey, Syd?

43
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:37,086
You're going to be a great mom.

44
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,140
Thanks.

45
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:55,512
You seem to be enjoying your freedom.

46
00:03:55,513 --> 00:03:57,765
I was hoping to offer you more
than prison food.

47
00:03:57,766 --> 00:04:01,295
I must confess, I'd grown rather fond
of the shepherd's pie.

48
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:08,890
I'm assuming you didn't bring me here
simply for the cuisine.

49
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:10,577
Look, Jack, during the past few months,

50
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:13,754
I have had to rely on you
more than any friend should,

51
00:04:14,826 --> 00:04:17,952
which is what makes it difficult for me
to ask you this.

52
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:19,305
You need another favor?

53
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,108
I want to return to A.P.O.

54
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,076
Of course, my position
would be subordinate.

55
00:04:25,077 --> 00:04:26,952
You would be the Director
of the task force,

56
00:04:26,953 --> 00:04:29,498
and I would have
the highest respect for that.

57
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:31,625
In return, you can engage my connections

58
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:34,449
wherever you thought
it would be most effective.

59
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,500
And you would, in turn,

60
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:39,677
have full C.I.A. resources
to search for Nadia's cure.

61
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:41,751
Exactly.

62
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:45,876
I know this puts you
in an awkward position...

63
00:04:45,877 --> 00:04:49,314
I've already put in the request
for your limited reinstatement.

64
00:04:49,315 --> 00:04:50,315
You have?

65
00:04:52,314 --> 00:04:53,438
I don't know what to say...

66
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,321
Your gratitude may be premature.

67
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,421
Langley hasn't denied the request,
but they haven't approved it either.

68
00:04:58,422 --> 00:05:00,781
Normally, these things
take a few days, but

69
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:04,340
I'm getting informal reports
that something,

70
00:05:05,564 --> 00:05:08,093
or, rather, someone
is standing in the way.

71
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:10,687
Do you know who?

72
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:14,117
I'm happy to make my case personally.

73
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,806
I'm trying to ascertain that myself.

74
00:05:23,627 --> 00:05:26,033
I apologize.
I'm going to have to cut this short.

75
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,507
Whether you're successful or not,
Jack, thank you.

76
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,125
18 hours ago,

77
00:06:19,252 --> 00:06:22,428
an army storage facility
was hit outside of Frankfurt.

78
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:24,362
The Dornier stockpile?

79
00:06:24,691 --> 00:06:26,808
The intruder crossed two minefields,

80
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:29,730
deactivated a 30,000-volt electric fence

81
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:33,065
and took down half a dozen army rangers
by nonlethal means.

82
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:34,941
Do we have any potential suspects?

83
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:37,438
Agent Grace is on the phone
to the base in Germany now

84
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,497
trying to get uplinks
of their surveillance imagery.

85
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:44,315
This lone individual walked
right past a stockpile of heavy weapons

86
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:48,792
opting instead for a few hundred cc's
for something called atropine ZX.

87
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:52,721
ZX is a highly experimental
medical stimulant.

88
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:55,454
Its primary use is for
battlefield resuscitation

89
00:06:55,455 --> 00:06:56,942
of gravely injured soldiers.

90
00:06:56,943 --> 00:06:59,394
The infiltration bears
striking similarities

91
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:01,191
to the D.S.R. theft a month ago.

92
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:03,040
Are you suggesting
this is somehow connected

93
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,068
with the container
we recovered in North Korea?

94
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:07,626
It could be the secondary phase
of the same operation.

95
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:08,920
By all appearances,

96
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:11,600
the man inside the container
was in some sort of

97
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:13,569
next-gen cryogenic deep freeze.

98
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,067
And the stolen ZX could be used
to wake up the body?

99
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,185
It's possible, yes.

100
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:18,553
Yes, Guder, I promise.

101
00:07:18,635 --> 00:07:22,752
Eight cases of jerky, half beef,
half turkey. It's on the way. Danke.

102
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:25,133
Apparently, you can't get
good beef jerky in Germany.

103
00:07:25,134 --> 00:07:27,974
Really? I always thought of Germany
as the home of processed meats.

104
00:07:27,975 --> 00:07:29,978
You know, 'cause
all the sausages that they...

105
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:32,353
and there's liverwurst,
bratwurst, fleischwurst...

106
00:07:32,354 --> 00:07:33,354
Here it comes.

107
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:36,359
Let's take a look at our bad boy.

108
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,356
Put it on-screen.

109
00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:48,339
Make that a bad girl.

110
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:52,025
Renée Rienne,
also known as "Le Corbeau".

111
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:54,731
In '02, she attacked one of our
listening posts in Turkey,

112
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:57,967
made her number eight
on the C.I.A.'s most wanted list.

113
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:00,480
You don't know she's the one
who took the body.

114
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:03,657
No, but it's beyond reason
that this is a coincidence.

115
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,478
If she took the body, she had a reason.

116
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:06,552
I'll talk to her.

117
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,542
You exchange information with her
twice a week.

118
00:08:08,543 --> 00:08:09,955
If she hasn't told you by now...

119
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,543
Not over the phone. I'll go in person.

120
00:08:11,544 --> 00:08:13,544
Sydney, this woman is an assassin.

121
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,028
Vaughn trusted her.
They worked together for seven years.

122
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,450
Besides, if she did take the body
and hasn't told me,

123
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:21,167
it's because
she doesn't trust me, either.

124
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,730
If we make a move on her,
that just proves she's right.

125
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:25,606
I'm hardly concerned with her feelings.

126
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:28,665
No, but I am concerned about
burning her as an ally.

127
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:31,354
We know the body
was in Dean's possession.

128
00:08:31,355 --> 00:08:34,043
Finding out why may tell us more
about Prophet Five,

129
00:08:34,044 --> 00:08:35,808
what their ultimate agenda is.

130
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,464
Go see her, but you're not going alone.

131
00:08:50,807 --> 00:08:52,283
I think you got him.

132
00:08:54,295 --> 00:08:57,765
My mother always said,
if somebody was worth shooting once,

133
00:08:57,857 --> 00:08:59,229
then they're worth shooting twice.

134
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,421
I'm sorry I never met her.

135
00:09:00,422 --> 00:09:02,046
She sounds like my kind of woman.

136
00:09:02,047 --> 00:09:04,811
I think the two of you
would have gotten along.

137
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:10,865
Sydney's going to Marseilles
to meet with a contact.

138
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:12,169
Wheels up within the hour.

139
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,934
I'd like you to accompany her.

140
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:17,313
I'm on escort duty.

141
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,421
Sydney's contact is Renée Rienne.

142
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:21,731
Really?

143
00:09:21,732 --> 00:09:24,183
Miss Rienne has been helping Sydney
with her investigation

144
00:09:24,184 --> 00:09:25,798
into the Prophet Five conspiracy,

145
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:29,400
though that fact is off the books.

146
00:09:30,295 --> 00:09:31,295
Got it.

147
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,067
Miss Rienne used to work
with Michael Vaughn.

148
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:38,224
Based on that,
my daughter has inherent trust in her.

149
00:09:39,672 --> 00:09:41,842
I do not share her trust.

150
00:09:42,483 --> 00:09:43,483
I see.

151
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:45,668
Don't worry.

152
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:48,077
I'll make sure she's safe.

153
00:09:55,797 --> 00:09:57,171
Hope you got the right address.

154
00:09:57,172 --> 00:10:00,481
Micro surveillance cameras,
motion detectors on the windows.

155
00:10:00,482 --> 00:10:02,171
And this is definitely her place.

156
00:10:02,172 --> 00:10:05,107
I'll cover the stairs,
you slip around front to the elevator.

157
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:06,604
Put that away. You won't need it.

158
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:09,016
She's already killed
three C.I.A. agents.

159
00:10:09,231 --> 00:10:10,797
We're not going to be four and five.

160
00:10:10,798 --> 00:10:12,295
When my father briefed you,

161
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:13,857
he told you we'd been working together.

162
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:14,858
Yeah.

163
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,732
He also said if I suspected a threat
to your safety,

164
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:19,262
I have orders to kill her.

165
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:21,070
My father is overprotective.

166
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:34,954
It's me. We need to talk.

167
00:10:35,672 --> 00:10:36,796
It's not a good time.

168
00:10:36,797 --> 00:10:38,502
It can't wait. I'm out front.

169
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,172
I know.

170
00:10:48,358 --> 00:10:49,993
We aren't here to threaten you, Renée.

171
00:10:49,994 --> 00:10:52,481
- We had an agreement.
- I know you took the body.

172
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:54,230
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

173
00:10:54,231 --> 00:10:58,100
No, I can't. This is different.
I need to do this myself.

174
00:10:58,423 --> 00:11:00,011
Well, that's not an option.

175
00:11:00,611 --> 00:11:02,434
Does he know what you're up to?

176
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,025
No, he's not dangerous.

177
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:25,922
He won't hurt me, he won't hurt me!

178
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:27,311
- Let her go!
- He won't hurt me!

179
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,982
- Do you have the shot?
- Just say when.

180
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:30,814
No, please, he doesn't understand.

181
00:11:58,002 --> 00:11:59,237
Did I hear her right?

182
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:00,874
He's her father.

183
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,029
Was it Desantis?

184
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:03,095
Desantis.

185
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,475
I do not... remember.

186
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:26,006
Is Desantis part of Prophet Five?

187
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:30,476
Prophet Five?

188
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,024
What do you know about them?

189
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,000
No, no, I am fine.

190
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:38,587
You're not fine. Your ear is bleeding.

191
00:13:40,664 --> 00:13:42,369
- Here, get him down.
- Dad?

192
00:13:42,663 --> 00:13:43,663
Get him down.

193
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,700
His pulse is all over the place.

194
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,508
We need something to sedate him
to get his heart rate under control.

195
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:50,535
I'll get some Diazepam.

196
00:13:50,536 --> 00:13:51,771
Keep his legs steady.

197
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,790
Calm down.

198
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:10,665
His heartbeat's weak, but it's stable.

199
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,663
What do you know about that device?
Why was he in it?

200
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:14,664
I don't know.

201
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,649
I just had to get him out of there.

202
00:14:36,538 --> 00:14:39,438
How's your daughter? Nadia, right?

203
00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:42,381
That's such a pretty name.

204
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:45,224
What are you doing here?

205
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:47,283
Just checking up on our investment.

206
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:49,601
I thought this might be
a good place to find you.

207
00:14:49,602 --> 00:14:52,072
Don't you ever contact me
in public again.

208
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:56,615
And tell whoever you answer to
that I'm proceeding as instructed.

209
00:14:57,101 --> 00:14:58,159
Tell him yourself.

210
00:15:12,101 --> 00:15:14,483
- Hello, Arvin.
- Hello, Gordon.

211
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,600
So you're my mysterious benefactor.

212
00:15:19,415 --> 00:15:20,415
I'm one of them.

213
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,717
Are you familiar with Senator Lewis?

214
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:35,600
She's the Chairman
of the Intelligence Committee.

215
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,725
She's the reason your security clearance
hasn't been reinstated.

216
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:40,814
She doesn't seem
to care very much for you.

217
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,663
It may have something to do
with the fact

218
00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:44,352
that she's actually
a decent human being.

219
00:15:44,353 --> 00:15:46,470
If she's the one standing in my way,

220
00:15:46,664 --> 00:15:49,664
my chances of returning to A.P.O.
are slim at best.

221
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:52,079
And I need you at A.P.O.

222
00:15:54,793 --> 00:15:57,518
You're going to have to persuade
Senator Lewis

223
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,910
to see things your way.

224
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,733
Luckily, that's what you do best.

225
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,726
Look, I gotta be honest with you.

226
00:16:07,727 --> 00:16:09,790
I've had basic field medical training.

227
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,004
If the guy were shot,

228
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:13,602
I could handle that,
but this is beyond me.

229
00:16:13,603 --> 00:16:14,663
Is he stable?

230
00:16:14,664 --> 00:16:15,978
That's kind of hard to define.

231
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:19,011
He was bleeding out of his eyes
and his ears. He's unconscious.

232
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,886
His breathing's shallow but regular.

233
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:22,975
Well, if we knew why
he was in the container,

234
00:16:22,976 --> 00:16:25,321
we might have a better idea
of what was wrong with him.

235
00:16:25,322 --> 00:16:26,575
I took a look inside the box.

236
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:29,699
It's lined with I.V.s
apparently feeding him nutrients.

237
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,264
There's an on-board hard drive
tracking his vitals.

238
00:16:32,265 --> 00:16:34,700
Other than that,
a bunch of tech stuff I can't identify.

239
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:37,451
I still have contacts within the D.S.R.
I can reach out.

240
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:39,701
Maybe they analyzed the container
before it was stolen.

241
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:43,249
Renée mentioned a name...
a Dr. Aldo Desantis.

242
00:16:43,451 --> 00:16:46,139
Apparently he put her father
in the box 20 years ago.

243
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,140
I know that name.

244
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:50,014
Dean had me arrange
the transfer of some of his files.

245
00:16:50,015 --> 00:16:52,720
They were archived
at the university of Milan,

246
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:57,014
but about a year ago, Dean had me
move them to a private facility

247
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,015
in San Francisco.

248
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:00,980
Agent Grace, tell Renée

249
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:03,325
we'll coordinate a mission
to obtain the Desantis files.

250
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:05,827
Perhaps they'll shed some light
on her father's condition.

251
00:17:05,828 --> 00:17:08,475
In the meantime,
contact Dr. Étienne Laurent.

252
00:17:08,638 --> 00:17:10,263
He's 20 minutes outside Marseille.

253
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:12,200
He can check Renée's father
into a facility

254
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:15,201
under an assumed name
and run the full examination.

255
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:18,038
Copy that.
I'll contact you when I get there.

256
00:17:18,827 --> 00:17:20,015
I can take care of him.

257
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:22,826
No, you can't.
If my father vouches for this doctor,

258
00:17:22,827 --> 00:17:24,297
your father will be safe.

259
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:26,756
Look, if we were going
to double-cross you,

260
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:28,091
we would have done it already.

261
00:17:28,702 --> 00:17:29,937
Just let us help you.

262
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:32,576
You have my word.

263
00:17:34,514 --> 00:17:35,514
Okay.

264
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:38,468
I'll pull a van around front.

265
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:57,515
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

266
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,256
They want my father.

267
00:19:16,765 --> 00:19:17,823
We're under siege!

268
00:19:18,394 --> 00:19:20,269
They want Renee's father. Who are they?

269
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,205
- I wish I knew.
- It's the D.G.S.E.

270
00:19:22,206 --> 00:19:23,206
Intelligence?

271
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,725
No, it's not French military.
They're armed too well.

272
00:19:25,726 --> 00:19:27,159
That's why I didn't tell you.

273
00:19:27,395 --> 00:19:28,890
What, you think we brought 'em here?

274
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:30,110
How else would they know?

275
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:33,978
It's no good.
They're using a jamming device.

276
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,152
- We need weapons.
- Back there.

277
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:37,327
There is a closet.

278
00:19:38,202 --> 00:19:39,437
I have an army radio.

279
00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:43,209
If you can find a clear frequency,
call for help.

280
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:54,954
Inside those cases, there are monitors
for the security cameras.

281
00:19:54,955 --> 00:19:56,484
See what are we up against.

282
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,396
Well, there are 12 of them
it looks like, at least.

283
00:20:00,455 --> 00:20:02,749
They're planning something. What is it?

284
00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:07,082
What's that?

285
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:10,446
Gas. They want to knock us out
before they attack us.

286
00:20:11,022 --> 00:20:13,145
Right there,
they're pumping it into the vent.

287
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:15,322
Get in the bedroom. Seal yourself in.

288
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:16,711
I'll take out the truck.

289
00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:18,688
No, no, no, I'll go.

290
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,708
You watch your father.

291
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:21,709
Come on.

292
00:20:29,212 --> 00:20:30,772
Marshall, Dixon's ready for us.

293
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:33,773
Yeah, I'm ready. It's gotta be here
somewhere. Where is it?

294
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,255
You know what an audio coupler is?

295
00:20:35,256 --> 00:20:38,128
You know, the piece that slides
over the base of a telephone headset?

296
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:39,360
Yeah, like from "War Games."

297
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:41,634
You know "War Games"?

298
00:20:42,585 --> 00:20:44,397
Yeah, it's my second-favorite movie.

299
00:20:44,398 --> 00:20:45,398
Really? Mine too.

300
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:47,070
Now don't tell anyone, but

301
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:49,896
it's what inspired me to hack
into the Pentagon for the first time.

302
00:20:49,897 --> 00:20:50,897
How'd you get in?

303
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:55,000
I, uh, went in through
the electrical system.

304
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:58,085
Yeah, there was a side-wire cutout
for air conditioning repairs,

305
00:20:58,086 --> 00:21:00,461
so I got the woman
from the repair company on the phone

306
00:21:00,462 --> 00:21:02,836
and convinced her
that I was inside the building and then

307
00:21:02,837 --> 00:21:04,711
sweet-talked her
into giving me the password.

308
00:21:04,712 --> 00:21:06,087
I think her name was Ina.

309
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:08,793
I went straight in
through the sewer controls.

310
00:21:09,274 --> 00:21:11,568
Really? That's... that's pretty smart...

311
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:13,875
and a lot... easier.

312
00:21:16,897 --> 00:21:19,587
So are we hacking into
the storage facility's network?

313
00:21:19,588 --> 00:21:22,146
Yeah, to find out
where the Desantis files are stored.

314
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,899
Well, if we're going in via R.F.,
then the network must be terminal.

315
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,900
No, closed loop.

316
00:21:26,773 --> 00:21:27,773
Oh! Found it.

317
00:21:36,464 --> 00:21:38,962
I hope none of you
suffer from arachnophobia,

318
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:42,921
'cause this little 6-legged freak
is not pretty, but

319
00:21:43,212 --> 00:21:44,506
she gets the job done.

320
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:46,996
I call her Charlotte,
for obvious reasons.

321
00:21:46,997 --> 00:21:48,043
Oh, check this out.

322
00:21:48,044 --> 00:21:50,521
There is a tomographic camera
right on the bottom there.

323
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:52,711
It basically acts
like an X-ray or a C.A.T. scan.

324
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,535
It takes images layer by layer.

325
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:56,272
See? Look at that.

326
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:03,337
This will allow us to take images
of the Desantis files...

327
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:06,338
without ever having to remove them
from their storage container.

328
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:07,339
Right.

329
00:22:10,075 --> 00:22:12,300
I assume your vaults
are climate-controlled.

330
00:22:12,301 --> 00:22:13,462
Of course.

331
00:22:13,463 --> 00:22:15,774
Now if your purchase
our premium package,

332
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:19,400
your item will be stored
in the most secure wing of our facility.

333
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:22,500
Yes, I've heard that before.

334
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,246
Let me explain something.

335
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:29,401
This particular piece is from
the Yongle period... very delicate.

336
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:32,600
I don't want the most secure wing.

337
00:22:33,275 --> 00:22:34,750
I want the wing

338
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:37,398
you reserve for the people
who will come looking for you

339
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,457
if anything happens to their stuff.

340
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:44,181
Right this way.

341
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:48,494
Oh, my cell died.

342
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:50,245
Call my wife, would you?

343
00:22:50,246 --> 00:22:51,682
Let her know we're running late.

344
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:53,119
- Would you mind?
- Of course not.

345
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,708
- Be my guest.
- Thank you.

346
00:23:05,996 --> 00:23:08,432
Hi, Meredith.
We're running a little bit behind.

347
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:09,903
Nice. Phone link is good.

348
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:12,227
Accessing the network.

349
00:23:17,904 --> 00:23:18,932
Uh, you know what?

350
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:20,682
Just stay on the phone one more minute.

351
00:23:20,683 --> 00:23:22,741
Yeah, I'll have him home by dinner.

352
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:31,371
Got it.

353
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:36,369
As you can see,
temperature and humidity-controlled.

354
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:40,333
We even have backup generators
in case of prolonged blackout.

355
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:42,311
This is fine.

356
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:43,906
I'm glad you're pleased.

357
00:23:48,307 --> 00:23:52,424
Now if you'll just follow me,
we can finish the rest of our paperwork.

358
00:24:06,372 --> 00:24:08,313
Come on, Charlotte. You go, girl.

359
00:24:17,371 --> 00:24:18,488
Come on, Charlotte.

360
00:24:18,998 --> 00:24:20,056
Don't let me down.

361
00:24:29,714 --> 00:24:30,897
How's it coming?

362
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:32,376
Well, according to their network,

363
00:24:32,377 --> 00:24:35,157
the Desantis files
are inside cabinet 2187,

364
00:24:35,621 --> 00:24:38,603
so, we'll soon see for ourselves.

365
00:24:41,998 --> 00:24:43,115
Come on, Charlotte.

366
00:24:43,372 --> 00:24:44,372
Work some magic.

367
00:24:45,434 --> 00:24:48,492
All right, imaging through
the first layer of metal.

368
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:50,286
"Desantis." We got 'em.

369
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:53,809
Good.

370
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,871
Let's scan the rest of those documents
and relay them to A.P.O.

371
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:57,872
Okay.

372
00:25:07,497 --> 00:25:08,497
Any luck?

373
00:25:10,062 --> 00:25:12,650
Low-band frequencies
are completely blocked.

374
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:15,303
I found this midrange.

375
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:17,232
Chatter of some kind,

376
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:19,928
but it's too noisy to transmit over.

377
00:25:21,622 --> 00:25:22,822
He's got a fever.

378
00:25:23,812 --> 00:25:25,459
Why do they want him, Renée?

379
00:25:28,496 --> 00:25:29,554
Tell me the truth.

380
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:33,087
I was very sick as a child.

381
00:25:34,188 --> 00:25:36,835
The medicine I was taking;
it was expensive.

382
00:25:36,997 --> 00:25:40,555
My father answered an ad
in the newspaper for a job.

383
00:25:43,123 --> 00:25:47,064
Later that week, he came home
with more money than I had ever seen.

384
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,398
I could tell he was scared.

385
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:53,549
He packed what he could, and we left.

386
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:56,587
He didn't want to scare me,

387
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,983
but I knew he was running from someone.

388
00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:03,690
One day in Geneva, they found us.

389
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:37,824
I later found out that the man I saw
take my father was Desantis.

390
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:42,910
They were his clinical trials
my father had been paid for.

391
00:26:47,688 --> 00:26:49,864
I assumed they killed him that night.

392
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,528
This is why you began
pursuing Prophet Five.

393
00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:55,824
To make them pay.

394
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,766
- What can you see?
- Nothing.

395
00:28:26,252 --> 00:28:27,840
I don't know if he made it.

396
00:28:35,877 --> 00:28:36,877
Renée!

397
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,880
Dad?

398
00:28:48,985 --> 00:28:50,102
It's me! Let me in.

399
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,110
Nice job.

400
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:05,686
I think I just pissed 'em off.

401
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,535
We need to get ready.

402
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,329
They'll be coming in soon.

403
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:11,970
Sydney, you stay here with her father.

404
00:29:12,046 --> 00:29:13,860
If I can take enough of them out,

405
00:29:13,861 --> 00:29:16,213
maybe they'll decide we're not worth it.

406
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,596
She's quite talented.

407
00:29:41,484 --> 00:29:42,484
Thank you.

408
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:44,277
You must be very proud.

409
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:45,985
You have no idea.

410
00:29:48,925 --> 00:29:49,925
Senator Lewis.

411
00:29:50,861 --> 00:29:52,861
What can I do for you, Mr. Sloane?

412
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:56,660
Well, actually,
I was hoping for a minute of your time.

413
00:29:57,486 --> 00:29:58,637
If you've come here to lobby

414
00:29:58,638 --> 00:30:00,487
for your security clearance
to be approved,

415
00:30:00,488 --> 00:30:02,359
I suggest you save yourself the trouble.

416
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,700
Yeah, I understand your reluctance,

417
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:07,565
but I'm asking you
to reconsider your position.

418
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,483
With my knowledge and my resources,

419
00:30:09,484 --> 00:30:11,954
I can be a valuable asset
to this country.

420
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:13,675
Touching.

421
00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:15,518
But somehow, I doubt

422
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,736
that you're motivated
by mere patriotism.

423
00:30:17,737 --> 00:30:19,619
You're right, I have an agenda...

424
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:21,669
my daughter Nadia.

425
00:30:23,177 --> 00:30:24,177
She's very sick.

426
00:30:25,286 --> 00:30:26,299
I know.

427
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,064
I hope to use A.P.O. resources
to find a cure for her condition.

428
00:30:30,424 --> 00:30:34,541
In exchange, I will happily do
whatever the government requires of me.

429
00:30:35,986 --> 00:30:37,750
I'm sorry about your daughter,

430
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,580
but I can't in good conscience
put you back in that office.

431
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:45,441
If it were up to me,
you'd still be in prison.

432
00:30:45,442 --> 00:30:47,694
You'll have to find another way
to help your daughter.

433
00:30:47,695 --> 00:30:49,359
I'm not reinstating your clearance.

434
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:57,008
Your daughter's very lovely.

435
00:31:00,236 --> 00:31:01,941
I'm sure you're proud of her.

436
00:31:02,675 --> 00:31:05,380
You'll recognize the inside
of your own house.

437
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,610
You'll notice none of those pictures
were taken with a telephoto lens.

438
00:31:08,611 --> 00:31:11,300
The photographer was standing
right next to her.

439
00:31:11,301 --> 00:31:14,712
It makes you wonder
about her security detail, doesn't it?

440
00:31:15,427 --> 00:31:18,779
It makes you wonder
if you can ever keep her safe at all.

441
00:31:21,176 --> 00:31:22,470
Mom, did you see that?

442
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:23,801
I did, honey.

443
00:31:23,988 --> 00:31:26,484
I was just telling your mother
how talented you are.

444
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:28,485
You know, you skate like an angel.

445
00:31:28,861 --> 00:31:30,625
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

446
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:38,045
Enjoy the rest of your day, Senator.

447
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,035
Thank you in advance for your support.

448
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:51,239
They're gone.

449
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:54,624
What do you mean, they're gone?

450
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:55,987
They're not in the street.

451
00:31:55,988 --> 00:31:58,517
That's 'cause they're probably
on the roof.

452
00:32:00,863 --> 00:32:01,863
You're hurt.

453
00:32:02,425 --> 00:32:03,425
It's nothing.

454
00:32:08,989 --> 00:32:10,165
I found this device.

455
00:32:10,611 --> 00:32:12,669
They all have them. It's a tracker.

456
00:32:13,988 --> 00:32:15,487
They're probably following a signal.

457
00:32:15,488 --> 00:32:16,488
From what?

458
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:23,773
It's an emergency beacon.

459
00:32:23,852 --> 00:32:26,245
You must have activated it
when you opened the container.

460
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:27,302
No, I would have noticed.

461
00:32:27,303 --> 00:32:28,611
Their signal's still active.

462
00:32:28,612 --> 00:32:30,677
It's not jamming the frequency
this transmits on.

463
00:32:30,678 --> 00:32:34,266
Maybe I could piggyback this signal,
get out a call for help.

464
00:32:37,363 --> 00:32:39,480
Jack, I've just received hard copies

465
00:32:39,863 --> 00:32:41,230
of all data the D.S.R. obtained

466
00:32:41,231 --> 00:32:43,303
from the cryo-container
before it was stolen.

467
00:32:43,304 --> 00:32:45,132
Marshall and Rachel
are in the briefing room

468
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:47,460
reviewing the files you recovered
from San Francisco.

469
00:32:47,461 --> 00:32:48,704
I'll cross-index the data.

470
00:32:50,739 --> 00:32:52,621
Is there something else, Marcus?

471
00:32:52,928 --> 00:32:56,489
I just got off the phone
with the office of Senator Dianne Lewis,

472
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,381
the Chairperson
of the Intelligence Committee.

473
00:32:58,382 --> 00:32:59,584
Yes, I know who she is.

474
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:02,155
Her office was following up on a request

475
00:33:02,489 --> 00:33:05,194
to reinstate Arvin Sloane's
security clearance

476
00:33:06,115 --> 00:33:08,467
so he could return to duty within A.P.O.

477
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:11,362
I told them I didn't know anything
about it.

478
00:33:11,363 --> 00:33:14,715
The request to reinstate
Sloane's clearance came from me.

479
00:33:16,053 --> 00:33:17,464
I assume it was granted.

480
00:33:17,678 --> 00:33:19,325
He's been given full access,

481
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,910
gold level and beyond.

482
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,740
Are you certain
this is the right course of action?

483
00:33:25,489 --> 00:33:28,671
I believe Arvin Sloane
now has a single purpose...

484
00:33:29,802 --> 00:33:31,302
to save the life of his daughter.

485
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:34,597
If it is within my power
to help him with that endeavor,

486
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:35,913
I will do so, gladly.

487
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,740
Of course.

488
00:33:43,616 --> 00:33:45,429
I suppose having him here at A.P.O.

489
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,488
will allow us to keep a close eye
on his activities.

490
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:51,275
Yes, that thought
crossed my mind as well.

491
00:33:55,989 --> 00:33:57,459
Oh, I got it. Here it is.

492
00:33:58,991 --> 00:34:01,520
Uh, actually,
this is "Garceau" with an "A."

493
00:34:01,556 --> 00:34:03,714
Yeah, this here, look... "Goursaud."

494
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,270
Oh, "Goursaud," excellent.

495
00:34:05,302 --> 00:34:08,741
Oh, here. Looks like some kind of
chemical study, but it's all encoded.

496
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:11,803
And then the blood work,
brain scans and X-rays are all normal.

497
00:34:11,804 --> 00:34:13,804
This is also... yes... 20 years old.

498
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,551
So all this really tell us

499
00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:18,053
is that Mr. Goursaud was healthy
at the time he was abducted.

500
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:19,077
What do we got?

501
00:34:19,133 --> 00:34:20,490
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

502
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,843
This guy's into some freaky stuff here,

503
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:25,741
manipulation of neural pathways,
genetic manipulations.

504
00:34:25,742 --> 00:34:28,389
- Anything on Goursaud?
- Nothing that helps.

505
00:34:29,364 --> 00:34:32,775
The D.S.R. sent over
everything they had on the container.

506
00:34:33,116 --> 00:34:35,303
It looks like while Goursaud was inside,

507
00:34:35,304 --> 00:34:37,678
his brain functions
were severely limited.

508
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,615
The container was also administering
doses of antiproliferatives and...

509
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:43,086
calico-neurin inhibitors.

510
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,990
Calcineurin inhibitors, actually,
with a "S..." sound.

511
00:34:45,991 --> 00:34:48,365
It's an immunosuppressive drug,
basically

512
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:51,600
prevents the immune system
from attacking itself,

513
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,144
kind of like, you know,

514
00:34:53,145 --> 00:34:55,677
when a transplant patient
rejects a new organ.

515
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:58,000
But he hasn't had any transplant.

516
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:01,938
Wait a minute.
Is that Goursaud's E.E.G. reading?

517
00:35:06,493 --> 00:35:07,493
I don't get this.

518
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:08,930
Brain scans?

519
00:35:08,931 --> 00:35:12,105
Yeah, that one's from Desantis.
That one's from the D.S.R.

520
00:35:12,106 --> 00:35:14,273
- How old are these readings?
- Taken three weeks ago.

521
00:35:14,274 --> 00:35:16,443
They don't match.
A by-product of the aging process?

522
00:35:16,444 --> 00:35:17,495
Not gray matter.

523
00:35:17,555 --> 00:35:19,790
- The volume is set by age 4.
- Age 4.

524
00:35:19,897 --> 00:35:20,673
You're suggesting

525
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:23,457
the man who came out of
that container is not Luc Goursaud?

526
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:24,458
That's right.

527
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:26,334
- Then who is he?
- Somebody who...

528
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:28,364
who's not... Luc Goursaud.

529
00:35:28,898 --> 00:35:30,770
I just called the clinic in France.

530
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:32,594
Sydney and Tom never showed up.

531
00:35:32,773 --> 00:35:34,420
I tried her cell. No answer.

532
00:35:37,645 --> 00:35:41,074
The people who took me...
they want me back.

533
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:45,839
Give me to them,
and you all walk out of here.

534
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:47,569
That's not an option.

535
00:35:47,707 --> 00:35:50,000
20 years ago, I let them capture me

536
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,400
to keep Renée safe.

537
00:35:54,709 --> 00:35:56,000
Nothing has changed.

538
00:35:56,648 --> 00:35:58,000
I am her father.

539
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:01,481
It is my job to protect her.

540
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:05,033
But giving yourself to them
won't protect Renée.

541
00:36:05,834 --> 00:36:08,010
It will destroy her if you're killed.

542
00:36:08,523 --> 00:36:09,817
They will not kill me.

543
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:11,399
You can't know that.

544
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,576
Once they tracked the beacon up here,

545
00:36:14,397 --> 00:36:18,500
they could have blown us to bits,
but they did not.

546
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:21,600
They want me alive,

547
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:24,648
living.

548
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:27,211
What beacon?

549
00:36:29,775 --> 00:36:31,892
You just said they tracked a beacon.

550
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:34,733
What beacon?

551
00:36:44,274 --> 00:36:47,100
- Put the radio down.
- Dad...

552
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,899
This woman was trying to kill me.

553
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,782
He's lying.
He's the reason we're being attacked.

554
00:36:52,373 --> 00:36:53,715
Let her go.

555
00:36:53,781 --> 00:36:55,058
Don't!

556
00:36:58,064 --> 00:36:59,311
He said they tracked a beacon.

557
00:36:59,312 --> 00:37:01,001
He sent a signal. He led them here.

558
00:37:01,002 --> 00:37:03,498
Don't listen to her.
She's only trying to confuse us.

559
00:37:03,499 --> 00:37:05,793
This isn't an abduction. It's a rescue.

560
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:10,380
How do you know about the beacon?

561
00:37:14,062 --> 00:37:15,564
I'm your father, remember?

562
00:37:15,565 --> 00:37:16,565
I protected you.

563
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:19,169
That's right. Your father protected you.

564
00:37:19,376 --> 00:37:21,376
That night, when Desantis kidnapped him,

565
00:37:21,377 --> 00:37:25,024
you said he left you somewhere safe.
Ask him where he hid you.

566
00:37:25,187 --> 00:37:26,187
That is silly.

567
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:28,043
Ask him Renée, ask him.

568
00:37:29,524 --> 00:37:30,524
Tell me.

569
00:37:33,271 --> 00:37:35,100
That was 20 years ago, angel.

570
00:37:36,026 --> 00:37:38,084
But for you, it was only yesterday.

571
00:37:40,085 --> 00:37:41,085
Who are you?

572
00:38:19,837 --> 00:38:22,719
A.P.O. tracked the helicopter
to a small airport.

573
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:26,147
Shortly after it landed,
an executive jet took off,

574
00:38:26,588 --> 00:38:27,882
bound for North Korea.

575
00:38:28,963 --> 00:38:29,963
And that man?

576
00:38:32,086 --> 00:38:33,262
We still don't know.

577
00:38:33,523 --> 00:38:34,699
We're working on it.

578
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:38,275
We've seen things like this before,
believe it or not.

579
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:39,452
Doubling technology.

580
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,114
But it's impossible to say.

581
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:45,025
My team is still reviewing
Desantis' papers.

582
00:38:45,026 --> 00:38:48,212
Hopefully, they'll give us
some insight into Prophet 5

583
00:38:48,213 --> 00:38:50,860
I'll contact you
as soon as we know anything.

584
00:38:57,273 --> 00:38:58,743
I thought I had him back.

585
00:39:01,086 --> 00:39:02,086
I know.

586
00:39:03,464 --> 00:39:07,100
Michael always told me
I could come to you.

587
00:39:08,384 --> 00:39:09,501
I didn't trust him.

588
00:39:11,258 --> 00:39:12,258
I was wrong.

589
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,760
Thank you.

590
00:39:19,635 --> 00:39:20,635
Yeah.

591
00:39:47,447 --> 00:39:50,211
Gordon Dean.
How are you feeling, Dr. Desantis?

592
00:39:51,448 --> 00:39:53,212
Couldn't be better. Thank you.

593
00:39:53,696 --> 00:39:55,314
And I'm told there shouldn't be

594
00:39:55,315 --> 00:39:57,820
any lingering side effects
from the procedure.

595
00:39:57,821 --> 00:39:58,821
23 years.

596
00:40:00,887 --> 00:40:02,689
The cohesion problem was solved

597
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:05,945
once we understood
how to re-sequence the information.

598
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:08,574
The girl's alive.

599
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,773
She calls herself Renée Rienne.

600
00:40:12,447 --> 00:40:13,682
Works with the C.I.A.

601
00:40:14,888 --> 00:40:18,627
Well, then keeping an eye on her
won't be a problem.
