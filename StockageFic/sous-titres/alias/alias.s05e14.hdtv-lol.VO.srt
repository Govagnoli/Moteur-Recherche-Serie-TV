1
00:00:03,263 --> 00:00:04,263
She's not here.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,742
Repeat, Anna is not in the car.

3
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:14,952
Get out of my way!

4
00:00:14,953 --> 00:00:16,774
I won't let you, stop!

5
00:00:16,871 --> 00:00:17,876
Nadia, move!

6
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:21,062
I have betrayed everyone I ever loved,

7
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:24,724
but I was chosen,
and this is my road to follow.

8
00:00:25,264 --> 00:00:26,264
Welcome back.

9
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,626
Today, we shouldn't focus
on what we lost,

10
00:00:39,263 --> 00:00:42,036
but what we gained
by having Nadia in our lives.

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,312
I not only gained a sister,
but a friend.

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,933
When I think of the years of loneliness
she had,

13
00:00:53,703 --> 00:00:57,037
no family to speak of, not knowing
where she truly belonged,

14
00:00:58,883 --> 00:01:01,387
I am so grateful for the warmth
and affection

15
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,287
she was surrounded by in the end.

16
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:08,565
She taught me the meaning of family.

17
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:15,228
That it goes deeper than blood...

18
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:19,287
that it starts with friendship...

19
00:01:21,952 --> 00:01:25,898
and it comforts me to know that
although she was taken far too soon,

20
00:01:27,513 --> 00:01:28,935
what she left me with

21
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:31,668
will stay with me forever.

22
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:53,165
How could I have trusted him again?

23
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:55,595
After everything?

24
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,215
You thought he'd changed.

25
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:01,145
Nadia didn't.

26
00:02:02,643 --> 00:02:05,537
I convinced her that he deserved
a second chance.

27
00:02:08,393 --> 00:02:09,726
I showed him compassion.

28
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,796
I won't make that mistake again.

31
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:29,778
- Has he asked for anything?
- No, just a pitcher of water.

32
00:02:40,322 --> 00:02:41,326
How's it coming?

33
00:02:41,763 --> 00:02:44,078
Page 47, have you decoded it yet?

34
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:46,888
As I told you before,
it's going to take time,

35
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,827
more time if these interruptions
continue.

36
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:53,785
It's been almost a week already,
Mr. Sloane.

37
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:58,486
So when do you think
we may see some results?

38
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,896
This is isn't a crossword puzzle,
Ms. Peyton.

39
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,568
The key to Rambaldi's endgame
is encoded within that manuscript

40
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,406
where it has remained hidden
for the past 500 years.

41
00:03:09,511 --> 00:03:10,658
I hardly think

42
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:12,408
that a week is unreasonable.

43
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,088
Perhaps you'd like to take a walk
around the grounds,

44
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,097
something to clear your mind,
allow you to focus.

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,536
And I'm sure the armed gentleman
posted outside the door

46
00:03:24,593 --> 00:03:26,795
won't mind if I slip away
for a bit of lunch.

47
00:03:26,902 --> 00:03:28,086
You're not a prisoner,

48
00:03:28,463 --> 00:03:29,905
if that's what you're asking.

49
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:33,466
But given your fugitive status,
you can understand our reservations

50
00:03:33,532 --> 00:03:35,555
about letting you walk around in public.

51
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,795
Yes, of course.

52
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:40,497
I know you've had to make
some tough sacrifices.

53
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,338
We all have.

54
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:49,187
You think I'm having
a crisis of conscience

55
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:50,518
because I killed Nadia?

56
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,787
Let me be clear.

57
00:03:54,912 --> 00:03:56,376
No one will stand between me

58
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,985
and the fulfillment
of Rambaldi's ultimate vision.

59
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,428
No one.

60
00:04:04,142 --> 00:04:06,891
And unless you and your superiors
know someone else who's familiar

61
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:09,036
with 15th-century cryptography,

62
00:04:10,403 --> 00:04:12,517
I'm sure you can wait a few more days.

63
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,926
Of course.

64
00:04:19,531 --> 00:04:22,126
If there's anything we can do
to expedite your work,

65
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,898
you'll let me know?

66
00:04:31,722 --> 00:04:33,566
Have you ever seen
anything like that before?

67
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,437
It's basically
a solid state memory chip.

68
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:37,777
Cutting edge tech,
at least it was back in the '70s,

69
00:04:38,073 --> 00:04:40,666
which I'm guessing is
when this little guy was made.

70
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:42,567
What was it doing inside Renee?

71
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:45,788
That's the million-dollar question,
isn't it?

72
00:04:47,222 --> 00:04:49,377
Basically,
there's several hundred kilobytes of...

73
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,928
data on this thing.
Problem is, it's all encoded.

74
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,328
I would have thought
30-year-old encrypted algorithms

75
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:55,465
wouldn't present a problem.

76
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,538
Well, they wouldn't if the code
was complete, but

77
00:04:57,711 --> 00:05:00,636
half the data's missing,
probably corrupted over time.

78
00:05:01,173 --> 00:05:04,417
Without it, I can't create
a baseline for encryption analysis.

79
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:06,367
And you can't extrapolate
the missing data?

80
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,538
I'm trying to, but I'm not going
to hold my breath.

81
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:10,585
What about these markings?
What are these?

82
00:05:11,172 --> 00:05:12,627
It's probably nothing,

83
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,496
Maybe just a serial number, maybe,

84
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:19,435
or, the name of the company that desi...

85
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:21,858
- What is it?
- Hold on a sec.

86
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,967
I'll put it up on the monitor.

87
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:29,335
- We should tell Sydney.
- I'll do that.

88
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:30,718
In the meantime, Marshall,

89
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:32,597
<i>do whatever takes to break
that encryption.</i>

90
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:34,288
<i>I want to know what else
is on this chip,</i>

91
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:36,957
<i>and I want to know
what it was doing inside Renee.</i>

92
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,438
We just got a hit
on one of the hard lines.

93
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:42,618
Contact Peyton.

94
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,256
I'm sending it over now.

95
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:52,457
Isabelle,

96
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:54,218
will you please sleep?

97
00:05:54,293 --> 00:05:55,457
Sweetie...

98
00:06:09,553 --> 00:06:11,498
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, sweetheart.

99
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:12,868
Isn't this her nap time?

100
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,155
I wish.

101
00:06:14,552 --> 00:06:17,098
Apparently, this little girl
doesn't need sleep anymore.

102
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:19,408
We got a collective
four hours last night.

103
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:20,545
It must be genetic.

104
00:06:21,063 --> 00:06:23,927
You used to wake up at 4:00am
every day like clockwork.

105
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,146
I am sorry about that.

106
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,428
Did Marshall finish his analysis
of the chip?

107
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:30,098
Actually, that's why I'm here.

108
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:32,285
Marshall found data on it,
all of it encrypted,

109
00:06:32,362 --> 00:06:33,947
but he also found something else.

110
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:39,807
Vaughn's name was etched
on the outside of the device,

111
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,737
his real name... André Michaux.

112
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,595
Wait, what?

113
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,476
Marshall believes the chip was placed
inside Renée almost 30 years ago.

114
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,151
Vaughn and Renée
didn't know each other 30 years ago.

115
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:51,948
No, but their fathers did.
Vaughn told you

116
00:06:52,051 --> 00:06:53,997
they were working together
against Prophet Five.

117
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:55,157
And you're thinking what,

118
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:57,696
that one of them
implanted the chip inside Renee?

119
00:06:58,153 --> 00:07:00,597
At this point, it's
the most likely presumption.

120
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:03,818
- Why? Why would they...
- I don't know,

121
00:07:04,093 --> 00:07:08,375
but someone left Vaughn's name on it
intentionally, expecting it to be found.

122
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:10,407
It's possible he may have
some understanding

123
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,097
of what the chip contains.

124
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:15,235
Dad, no.

125
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,258
As far as Prophet Five is concerned,
Vaughn is dead.

126
00:07:18,463 --> 00:07:21,458
- Involving him at this point...
- A calculated risk, I know.

127
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:22,840
He's still in recovery.

128
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,378
- He is not field-ready.
- I know.

129
00:07:24,453 --> 00:07:26,506
I'll do everything I can to protect him.

130
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,841
We'll have an agent dead-drop the chip
to Vaughn.

131
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:29,838
He'll never be seen.

132
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,037
- Dad...
- Sydney,

133
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,578
we don't have a choice.

134
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:35,376
Sloane's decision to openly join
Prophet Five

135
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,838
suggests that they're close
to their endgame.

136
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,455
Right now this chip is our only lead.

137
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:47,586
But if someone's going
to take that chip to Vaughn, it's me.

138
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,477
<i>Syd's en route to Nepal
to see someone</i>

139
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:53,416
<i>who may be able
to decipher the chip.</i>

140
00:07:54,193 --> 00:07:55,288
<i>Who's the contact?<i>

141
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:57,070
<i>Someone who worked with Renee.</i>

142
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,405
<i>That's all Jack told me.</i>

143
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,055
This contact Sydney's meeting in Nepal,

144
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,112
do you have any idea who it is?

145
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,923
No, I don't know of any assets in Nepal.

146
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:10,277
So, I assume this means

147
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,066
that you're going to take action
on this.

148
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:13,658
Are you sure that's wise?

149
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,940
A.P.O. will want to know
how you obtained the intel,

150
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,766
which could prompt them
to looking into the security leak.

151
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:22,545
Whatever's on that chip,

152
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:25,235
I certainly hope it's worth the risk.

153
00:08:26,261 --> 00:08:27,535
Thanks for the counsel.

154
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,768
We're sending an agent
to intercept the device.

155
00:08:30,873 --> 00:08:33,268
We'd like you to brief her
before she leaves.

156
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,777
Fine, although I'm not sure
what further assistance I can provide.

157
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,388
I think you'd be surprised.

158
00:08:44,513 --> 00:08:45,625
Send her in, please.

159
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:55,516
You remember Anna Espinosa.

160
00:09:57,773 --> 00:09:58,695
You busy?

161
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,948
Just trying to catch up
on the latest tech.

162
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,155
What's going on?

163
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,536
When was the last time
you went to a movie?

164
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:09,185
The last movie?

165
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,717
I used to go to movies all the time, and

166
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,195
I haven't be in so long, because

167
00:10:15,643 --> 00:10:17,627
there's always something
more important to do.

168
00:10:19,273 --> 00:10:21,717
This isn't about going
to the movies, is it?

169
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:24,718
When you were working at The Shed,

170
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:27,408
did you ever see an agent buried?

171
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:33,818
- It takes a while to get over it.
- What if I can't?

172
00:10:34,271 --> 00:10:36,108
What if I'm not cut out for this?

173
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,957
First it was Gordon Dean,
and now it's Sloane.

174
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,298
They were right in front of me
the whole time deceiving me,

175
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,817
and I was oblivious.

176
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,707
You're a good agent, Rachel.

177
00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:51,407
Listen...

178
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,255
I would tell you if I didn't think
you could handle this.

179
00:11:16,912 --> 00:11:20,306
I'd like to place a classified ad
in next week's edition.

180
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:26,025
A child?

181
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:29,587
Yes, that's right.
Sydney has a daughter.

182
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,097
What's her name?

183
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:34,467
Isabelle.

184
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,658
I suppose Vaughn is the father
or was the father, I should say.

185
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:43,097
Yes, that's right.

186
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,875
In this business,

187
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,828
it's always the children who suffer.

188
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,976
Arvin, it troubles you, doesn't it?

189
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:57,456
Looking at me,

190
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,686
seeing her look back at you.

191
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:02,618
You're nothing like her.

192
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:05,017
I suppose you know what I'm like.

193
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:06,206
Of course I do.

194
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:08,187
You're driven by anger.

195
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:10,275
You crave power,

196
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,236
which I assume was something
you were deprived of in childhood.

197
00:12:13,653 --> 00:12:16,175
Sydney, on the other hand,
is driven by a sense of duty,

198
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:18,235
of loyalty to those she loves.

199
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,917
That's where she gets her strength.

200
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:24,446
It's also what makes her weak.

201
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:27,625
Attachments are a vulnerability,

202
00:12:28,191 --> 00:12:29,426
which are easily exploited.

203
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,406
And yet, she somehow
always manages to best you.

204
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:35,695
And now a victory
she's not even aware of.

205
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,595
Tell me,

206
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,587
I imagine you do your best
to avoid mirrors... yes?

207
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,287
And I suppose you believe
you're driven by faith.

208
00:12:46,563 --> 00:12:47,815
Look where it's gotten you.

209
00:12:49,322 --> 00:12:53,467
Something tells me being Prophet Five's
newest pawn wasn't exactly your endgame.

210
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:57,807
Unlike yourself, I know my place
in the big picture.

211
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,355
You, however, will continue
to deceive yourself

212
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,815
if you think you're anything more
than dispensable.

213
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:05,405
This...

214
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:08,286
...procedure that you've undergone...

215
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:12,238
Surely there must be a reason why
they want you to look like Sydney.

216
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:14,597
And when that purpose is fulfilled,

217
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,006
you will become unnecessary.

218
00:13:19,283 --> 00:13:20,285
Lovely catching up.

219
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,298
<i>The truth is you're no different
than she is.</i>

220
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,058
You're dispensable, too.

221
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:13,298
Miss Bristow...

222
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:16,978
I'm Nabin.

223
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:19,808
I'm afraid you must have overlooked me.

224
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:22,676
Yes, I did.

225
00:14:23,082 --> 00:14:23,985
It's no matter.

226
00:14:24,203 --> 00:14:25,656
You yourself are hard to overlook.

227
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,337
In fact...

228
00:14:27,453 --> 00:14:29,527
You're just as lovely
as Mr. Vaughn described.

229
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,687
Mr. Vaughn...

230
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:35,736
Don't tell him I told you.

231
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:37,585
He talks about you all the time.

232
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,598
Come, my car is just this way.

233
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:42,868
The drive up to Tambor
is only 20 minutes.

234
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:45,506
How is Mr. Vaughn?

235
00:14:46,162 --> 00:14:47,585
He's recovering very well.

236
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:49,118
Nicely healed, I should think.

237
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:50,815
Here we are.

238
00:14:52,232 --> 00:14:53,416
Can I help you with the bag?

239
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:00,758
Hurry!

240
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:02,078
We don't have much time.

241
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:04,425
His name's Nabin.

242
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,737
Michael Vaughn sent him
to pick up agent Bristow.

243
00:15:07,313 --> 00:15:08,158
Vaughn?

244
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:09,836
- Isn't he...
- Apparently not.

245
00:15:11,323 --> 00:15:13,258
- I'll see you at the intercept point.
- Wait.

246
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,527
Wear this.

247
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,105
- Nabin?
- Miss Bristow.

248
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,545
Welcome to Nepal.

249
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:30,495
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

250
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,496
Mr. Vaughn is so eager to see you.

251
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,806
<i>No, this is definitely not good,
all right?</i>

252
00:15:35,823 --> 00:15:36,535
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>

253
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,055
Answer me this:
When will you have

254
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,667
the one with the comfort grip in stock?

255
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,658
<i>I'll transfer you
to customer service.</i>

256
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:43,077
<i>Ask for the manager. His name...</i>

257
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,027
I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?
I can't...

258
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:46,715
<i>Can you hear me?</i>
- No. It's just...

259
00:15:46,782 --> 00:15:48,136
There's like a clicking sound.

260
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:49,305
Do you hear that clicking?

261
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:51,178
No. But I'll have the manager
give you a call.

262
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:52,828
Alright... Why don't you have him...

263
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:54,477
- call me? Thank you.
<i>- Alright.</i>

264
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,416
Thank you for nothing.

265
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:56,376
<i>Thank you for calling.</i>

266
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:11,866
We're out of coffee.

267
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:13,478
Coffee?

268
00:16:13,502 --> 00:16:14,248
Yeah...

269
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,547
I know you might not...

270
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,125
...think that's important.

271
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:18,307
A lot of people don't...

272
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:20,106
...don't drink coffee.
Generally might...

273
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:21,857
say that you should have some tea or...

274
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:24,595
Some soda, which also has some...

275
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:27,217
...caffeine, but I'm telling you,
it's not the same.

276
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,021
It's...

277
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,027
...important.

278
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:33,288
You're sure about this?

279
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,315
Positive. I noticed a glitch
on the phone,

280
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,988
so I checked the PBX controls.

281
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:38,885
According to the records,

282
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,637
Sloane logged on to the network,

283
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,057
and he put the entire phone system
on some sort of

284
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,796
passive surveillance mode, which...

285
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:46,535
I didn't even know was possible!

286
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,877
How did he get access?

287
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,018
All of his authorization codes
were revoked four days ago.

288
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:52,917
I was thinking the same thing but,
remember,

289
00:16:52,922 --> 00:16:54,747
Sloane installed most of the systems.

290
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:57,687
He must have installed
some sort of backdoor in the network.

291
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,007
Listen, for the past 24 hours,

292
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,167
Sloane and most likely
Prophet Five have been

293
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,206
able to monitor every conversation
inside A.P.O.

294
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:08,117
We need to contact Sydney immediately.

295
00:17:13,772 --> 00:17:14,486
Hello.

296
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,216
Sydney? Listen to me very carefully.

297
00:17:16,421 --> 00:17:17,655
<i>Are you with your contact?</i>

298
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,267
Yeah, I am.

299
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:21,438
There's been a security breach at A.P.O.

300
00:17:21,462 --> 00:17:22,406
It was Sloane.

301
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,378
<i>We have reason to believe
you've been compromised.</i>

302
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:31,016
No, we're right on time, actually.
I'll call you once we arrive.

303
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:37,995
Cell phones. They are a miracle.

304
00:17:44,072 --> 00:17:45,667
Don't slow down. Just go around.

305
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,516
You're in a hurry. I understand.

306
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,475
But perhaps, shouldn't we stop to help?

307
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,278
Hello, Sydney.

308
00:18:55,193 --> 00:18:56,786
Well, that was fairly easy.

309
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:58,206
Of course,

310
00:18:58,642 --> 00:19:01,478
if I'd known it was in Renée,
I would have saved us both the trouble

311
00:19:01,482 --> 00:19:02,866
and cut it out of her myself,

312
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:04,197
when I slit her throat.

313
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:05,536
Wait....

314
00:19:06,432 --> 00:19:07,356
Anna...

315
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:10,128
Sorry, Syd. Don't have time to chat.

316
00:19:10,802 --> 00:19:11,967
I've got a date.

317
00:19:13,582 --> 00:19:14,448
Now...

318
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:15,845
I don't know exactly

319
00:19:15,903 --> 00:19:18,218
what I'm going to do
with your boyfriend.

320
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:20,555
But whatever it is,

321
00:19:21,531 --> 00:19:22,766
I'll have fun doing it.

322
00:20:33,573 --> 00:20:34,585
Are you okay?

323
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:36,685
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

324
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,637
Actually, the doctor says
I don't need this anymore.

325
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,978
I think it looks debonair.

326
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,998
It does.

327
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,606
God, I missed you.

328
00:21:03,843 --> 00:21:04,927
How is she?

329
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:07,505
Isabelle.

330
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:11,718
She's beautiful.

331
00:21:13,263 --> 00:21:14,468
Just like her mother.

332
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,195
Isabelle.

333
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,787
Isabelle. You named her Isabelle.

334
00:21:22,252 --> 00:21:23,655
You like it?

335
00:21:24,051 --> 00:21:26,015
Yeah, it was my idea, wasn't it?

336
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,255
What is it you wanted? Clementine?

337
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:34,595
Not a day's gone by
that I didn't want to call you,

338
00:21:34,703 --> 00:21:35,717
talk to you.

339
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:41,817
I had this fear I'd never see you again.

340
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,357
Silly, huh?

341
00:21:46,023 --> 00:21:47,036
Maybe a little.

342
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:58,888
<i>I'm assuming this is good news.</i>

343
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,468
Have you made any progress?

344
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:01,946
No.

345
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:04,997
Unfortunately, I've discovered
an anomaly in the composition.

346
00:22:05,722 --> 00:22:09,057
Joseph Pinara's influence
in Rambaldi's encryption.

347
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:13,218
Pinara was a 14th-century cleric
who published...

348
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,346
I'll skip the history lesson,
if you don't mind.

349
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,356
"Le Libraire".

350
00:22:18,602 --> 00:22:20,995
It's a private seller
of used books in Geneva.

351
00:22:22,081 --> 00:22:24,378
They have a copy
of the Pinara manuscript.

352
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:27,936
I can't decipher Page 47 without it.

353
00:22:29,151 --> 00:22:30,158
Fine.

354
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,246
Write down the address.
I'll get it myself.

355
00:22:34,842 --> 00:22:35,876
Very well.

356
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:49,088
How long do you think
you can deceive them?

357
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,366
Page 47...

358
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,176
Eventually they're going to find out
you already know what it says.

359
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,037
You're stalling.

360
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:03,216
You must have some plan.

361
00:23:04,431 --> 00:23:05,966
What do you want from me, Nadia?

362
00:23:07,641 --> 00:23:08,775
I don't want anything.

363
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:12,578
Why don't you understand,

364
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:13,996
Nadia?

365
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,528
Every sacrifice I've ever made
has been for the greater good.

366
00:23:21,112 --> 00:23:24,136
Yet every sacrifice you've made
has come at someone else's expense.

367
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,478
Or have you forgotten?

368
00:23:31,272 --> 00:23:32,655
Oh, no, I haven't forgotten.

369
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,047
I play it over in my mind.

370
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,887
The irony.

371
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,765
All those years I was worried
about your well-being.

372
00:23:41,952 --> 00:23:43,795
And now I realize in the end,

373
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:46,836
I had no choice.

374
00:23:48,771 --> 00:23:50,558
You still believe that, don't you?

375
00:23:51,432 --> 00:23:53,946
That your actions
are controlled by fate?

376
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,076
That you were chosen?

377
00:23:57,961 --> 00:23:59,005
Why, dad?

378
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,705
Surely you must ask yourself
why would Rambaldi choose you?

379
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:06,135
You're not a man of honor.

380
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,396
You're not particularly courageous.

381
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,706
You're charitable, but only
when it serves your own interest,

382
00:24:11,773 --> 00:24:13,595
and last but not least,

383
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,675
you murder the people you claim to love.

384
00:24:17,203 --> 00:24:19,097
What do you want from me, Nadia?

385
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,716
I don't want anything.

386
00:24:21,031 --> 00:24:22,427
Then why are you here?

387
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:23,875
Dad...

388
00:24:26,072 --> 00:24:28,135
I'm here because you want me here.

389
00:24:30,353 --> 00:24:33,366
Now you can pursue Rambaldi
and have your daughter at the same time.

390
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:35,915
Isn't that what you said you wanted?

391
00:24:36,413 --> 00:24:37,897
Just before you killed me?

392
00:24:40,193 --> 00:24:41,157
No...

393
00:24:43,053 --> 00:24:44,266
Not like this.

394
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:46,866
Sir?

395
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,688
Do you need anything?

396
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,086
I thought I heard you talking.

397
00:24:56,153 --> 00:24:57,057
No.

398
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,136
I'm fine.

399
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:02,438
I can't believe Renée's dead.

400
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,868
If it hadn't been for her,
I wouldn't have known about

401
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,726
Prophet Five or the truth of my father.

402
00:25:08,463 --> 00:25:09,566
None of it.

403
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:13,645
Who killed her?

404
00:25:15,491 --> 00:25:16,698
Anna Espinosa.

405
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,587
Anna? She was in jail.

406
00:25:18,802 --> 00:25:21,285
Apparently Prophet Five
arranged for her release.

407
00:25:25,602 --> 00:25:26,715
What do you think it is?

408
00:25:28,752 --> 00:25:29,677
I don't know.

409
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,186
Renée never mentioned it.

410
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,288
Marshall couldn't decode it?

411
00:25:34,423 --> 00:25:36,236
He thought part of the code
might be missing.

412
00:25:37,751 --> 00:25:39,486
Unless the data's been corrupted.

413
00:25:39,523 --> 00:25:41,535
He thinks it was in her body
since she was a kid,

414
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:42,445
maybe 30 years.

415
00:25:44,672 --> 00:25:45,788
What is it?

416
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,377
Where was it, exactly?

417
00:25:49,753 --> 00:25:52,087
- What do you mean?
- Inside Renée's body,

418
00:25:52,102 --> 00:25:53,097
where was it?

419
00:25:53,963 --> 00:25:55,396
I don't know. Why?

420
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,655
My father once told me a story
that I had a bike accident

421
00:26:00,713 --> 00:26:02,687
when I was a kid,
drove it right into a tree.

422
00:26:03,331 --> 00:26:05,198
And even though
I have no recollection of it,

423
00:26:05,471 --> 00:26:07,877
I never questioned him,
because it left me with this scar.

424
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:14,827
Maybe the code isn't corrupted at all.

425
00:26:15,171 --> 00:26:16,516
Maybe there's another half.

426
00:26:24,401 --> 00:26:26,617
Okay, this might prevent infection,

427
00:26:27,451 --> 00:26:28,885
but it won't help with pain.

428
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,778
Yeah, well, you can handle childbirth,
I can handle this.

429
00:26:37,582 --> 00:26:38,746
I'm in good hands.

430
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,527
You need to sit very still.

431
00:26:43,782 --> 00:26:46,466
- This is going to hurt.
- Yeah, I know. You mentioned that.

432
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,907
It's okay. I trust you.

433
00:27:03,642 --> 00:27:04,645
Hello.

434
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:05,938
<i>Dad, it's me.</i>

435
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:07,995
Sydney, are you okay?

436
00:27:08,082 --> 00:27:10,152
<i>You were right.</i>
The mission's been compromised.

437
00:27:10,152 --> 00:27:11,565
Anna knows about Vaughn.

438
00:27:12,362 --> 00:27:13,350
Where are you?

439
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,767
Wait, dad, listen to me.

440
00:27:15,212 --> 00:27:16,218
It gets worse.

441
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:18,177
I've been doubled.

442
00:27:22,131 --> 00:27:23,577
You need to stay still.

443
00:27:24,402 --> 00:27:25,427
Think about some things.

444
00:27:25,462 --> 00:27:27,607
Yeah, well,
give me something to think about.

445
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:29,237
Tell me about Isabelle.

446
00:27:31,032 --> 00:27:32,977
Well, she has your eyes,

447
00:27:33,513 --> 00:27:35,896
the same... blue-green.

448
00:27:35,992 --> 00:27:39,617
And her smile is... is like your smile.

449
00:27:40,402 --> 00:27:42,927
- Really?
- Yeah, but her chin is pointy.

450
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,967
It's like mine. It's cute.

451
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,227
Oh, God, I can't wait to meet her!

452
00:27:49,443 --> 00:27:50,616
I got it.

453
00:27:53,611 --> 00:27:54,618
Apply pressure.

454
00:27:59,222 --> 00:28:00,228
Same etchings?

455
00:28:00,922 --> 00:28:01,925
"Renée Goursaud."

456
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,928
Yeah, can I see that?

457
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,556
Perfect fit.

458
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:33,738
I'm looking for a manuscript
by Joseph Pinara.

459
00:28:33,983 --> 00:28:34,986
I called ahead.

460
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:36,536
Wait one moment.

461
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,398
I've got it right over here.

462
00:28:43,883 --> 00:28:45,646
Your receipt is in the book.

463
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,995
Nothing else?

464
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,545
No, that'll be all.

465
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:51,226
Thanks.

466
00:29:02,101 --> 00:29:04,876
I believe there is someone
trying to contact you.

467
00:29:05,051 --> 00:29:06,118
No, it wasn't him.

468
00:29:06,813 --> 00:29:09,287
It was a woman,
but she knew the protocol.

469
00:29:18,082 --> 00:29:19,086
German.

470
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,536
Yeah.

471
00:29:21,883 --> 00:29:24,827
Looks like some sort
of emergency evacuation plan.

472
00:29:25,281 --> 00:29:27,815
Continuity of government
from the cold war.

473
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:31,288
It's a nuclear fallout bunker.

474
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,215
Hamburg, Germany, under Bergner park.

475
00:29:34,871 --> 00:29:36,876
You think there's something there?

476
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,087
Maybe.

477
00:29:38,532 --> 00:29:40,396
I'm going to go with you to find out.

478
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:41,916
Look, I know what you're thinking.

479
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,828
I'm not ready,
but, Syd, you said it yourself.

480
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,877
My father left this map.

481
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:47,896
Chances are, when you get there,
you may need my help.

482
00:29:48,822 --> 00:29:49,827
You're right.

483
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:51,898
I'll call for transport.

484
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:53,087
Okay.

485
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,118
What I'm about to tell you
is not to leave this room.

486
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:26,328
Agent Vaughn is alive.

487
00:30:27,422 --> 00:30:28,857
I knew it! I knew it!

488
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,807
I knew he couldn't be... dead.

489
00:30:31,532 --> 00:30:32,675
For the last several months,

490
00:30:32,701 --> 00:30:36,655
Vaughn's been kept in a secure location
in Nepal pending his recovery.

491
00:30:36,743 --> 00:30:38,702
I hope you can all
understand that secrecy

492
00:30:38,702 --> 00:30:41,356
was a necessary measure
to ensure his safety.

493
00:30:41,393 --> 00:30:43,868
Unfortunately,
those measures weren't sufficient.

494
00:30:43,912 --> 00:30:45,502
Through Sloane's tapping of our network,

495
00:30:45,502 --> 00:30:47,627
prophet five learned
of Sydney's trip to Nepal.

496
00:30:47,642 --> 00:30:49,636
They sent an agent to intercept her.

497
00:30:49,703 --> 00:30:51,476
- Is she okay?
- She's fine.

498
00:30:51,713 --> 00:30:54,837
She made it to Vaughn's location,
but Vaughn was no longer there.

499
00:30:54,891 --> 00:30:55,968
He was abducted.

500
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,036
In a matter of speaking.

501
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,458
We managed to pick up the trail.

502
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,716
This was taken in the Hamburg
international airport one hour ago.

503
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:09,446
The woman in the photo is not Sydney.

504
00:31:22,362 --> 00:31:24,767
You sure you got the coordinates right?

505
00:31:26,472 --> 00:31:28,305
What happened to Bergner park?

506
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,027
A lot changes in 30 years,

507
00:31:30,913 --> 00:31:32,948
but those bunkers
were steel-reinforced concrete.

508
00:31:32,981 --> 00:31:35,278
It would be pretty tough
to demolish something like that.

509
00:31:35,283 --> 00:31:38,515
My guess is that they're still under
there. We just have to find a way in.

510
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:41,178
You know,
that diamond store over there--

511
00:31:41,832 --> 00:31:44,677
it probably has some
pretty expensive pieces.

512
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:46,828
Chances are
they're locked away every night.

513
00:31:46,843 --> 00:31:49,686
In some sort of
basement storage room, maybe?

514
00:31:49,832 --> 00:31:50,838
Worth a try.

515
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:54,446
How do you want to handle this?

516
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,017
Like we did in Cartagena.

517
00:31:57,441 --> 00:31:58,747
I'll follow your lead.

518
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,345
Okay, let's go.

519
00:32:16,823 --> 00:32:19,075
Do you really think
you're going to get away with this?

520
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,367
You're out of your league.

521
00:32:20,392 --> 00:32:21,953
They killed Vaughn. They killed Renée.

522
00:32:21,953 --> 00:32:23,702
They've probably killed Sydney by now.

523
00:32:23,702 --> 00:32:25,787
Stop, Nadia. Just stop.

524
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,706
They're better than you, smarter.

525
00:32:31,473 --> 00:32:33,828
What makes you think you stand a chance?

526
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:36,087
This should solve all your problems.

527
00:32:37,172 --> 00:32:38,477
The Pinara manuscript.

528
00:32:39,181 --> 00:32:40,186
I hope it helps.

529
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:52,101
Well,
with all the work that has to be done,

530
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:53,578
I'll get out of your way.

531
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,158
Unfortunately,
I seem to be getting in my own way.

532
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,325
How is that?

533
00:33:03,711 --> 00:33:07,118
The effects of losing a child
cannot be underestimated.

534
00:33:07,683 --> 00:33:08,688
You're right.

535
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,738
I am distracted.

536
00:33:10,742 --> 00:33:13,387
In order for me to concentrate
on the future,

537
00:33:14,842 --> 00:33:16,898
I need to make peace with the past.

538
00:33:22,812 --> 00:33:24,538
Oh, baby, look at this one.

539
00:33:27,151 --> 00:33:29,066
- Really?
- Oh, it's gorgeous!

540
00:33:29,802 --> 00:33:32,178
No, I'd prefer that one there.
It's, you know...

541
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:34,058
- it's a little less big.
- No, no, no, no.

542
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:36,237
Is there anything you would like to see?

543
00:33:36,253 --> 00:33:37,955
Hi. Is this a princess cut?

544
00:33:38,022 --> 00:33:39,027
Yes, it is.

545
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:43,685
Your girlfriend has very good taste.

546
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,043
Yeah, for that price,
she might as well be a princess.

547
00:33:46,043 --> 00:33:47,628
It costs nothing to try on.

548
00:33:55,591 --> 00:33:58,538
A stone of that quality
has this effect on some people.

549
00:33:58,563 --> 00:33:59,808
No, she has seizures.

550
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:01,367
Kelly, just breathe. It's okay.

551
00:34:01,422 --> 00:34:03,117
Could I get some help here, please?

552
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,505
It's okay. Just relax.

553
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:09,977
How do I get access downstairs?

554
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,057
My keys... take my keys.

555
00:34:14,112 --> 00:34:15,118
Watch him.

556
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:34,782
I'm in Hamburg, Bromestrasse 123.

557
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:35,996
I'll need an extraction.

558
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,327
Don't hurt me, please.

559
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,808
I'll do whatever you ask.

560
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:40,095
Then shut up.

561
00:35:58,461 --> 00:35:59,635
Thanks.

562
00:35:59,962 --> 00:36:01,235
I've got it from here.

563
00:36:04,492 --> 00:36:05,495
Who are you?

564
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:08,305
It's a pity you'll never know.

565
00:36:16,862 --> 00:36:19,035
Sydney and I never went to Cartagena.

566
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,367
And just for the record,
you're a terrible kisser.

567
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,698
I always said Sydney
was too good for you.

568
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:03,917
Let's see if this one's loaded.

569
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:26,977
Are you all right?

570
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:29,325
Yeah, I'm fine. How did you...

571
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,698
Okay, we can go now.

572
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,885
Project summaries, test subjects,
names, dates-- it's all here.

573
00:38:55,212 --> 00:38:57,270
Your father's research of prophet five.

574
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:00,056
Most of these organizations
still exist, Syd.

575
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:01,398
We can end it all.

576
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,688
Hang on.

577
00:39:13,662 --> 00:39:14,667
Go ahead.

578
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:17,257
I got your message.
Did you get the chip?

579
00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:19,198
Yes. I'm done here.

580
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,428
Good.

581
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,156
Bleichen and Bromestrasse.

582
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:24,535
We should be there in five minutes.

583
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,485
That was Peyton.

584
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,541
She's coming to extract Anna.

585
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:29,548
Who's Peyton?

586
00:39:32,793 --> 00:39:34,141
Sloane is part of this.

587
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:35,737
He works with prophet five.

588
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,205
He killed Nadia.

589
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,305
This is my chance to stop him.

590
00:39:43,153 --> 00:39:44,155
I know.

591
00:39:47,111 --> 00:39:48,705
You can't go back to A.P.O.

592
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,588
There are moles within the government.
We can't trust anyone.

593
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:55,716
Contact my father.
Explain the situation.

594
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,026
Okay, I will.

595
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,988
Here, take this.

596
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,825
It's useless to them
without the other half.

597
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,395
Take the tracking device in your phone

598
00:40:06,401 --> 00:40:08,385
and embed it in the chip
before you hand it over.

599
00:40:08,422 --> 00:40:10,588
We'll be able to track your movements.

600
00:40:11,153 --> 00:40:12,155
I have to go.

601
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,068
I know.

602
00:40:22,032 --> 00:40:23,035
Be careful.

603
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,348
We were expecting
to hear from you sooner.

604
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,287
I ran into a few complications.

605
00:40:51,542 --> 00:40:53,156
Nothing I couldn't handle.

606
00:40:55,581 --> 00:40:56,588
And Sydney?

607
00:40:58,593 --> 00:40:59,595
She's dead.

608
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:06,005
This is what they found
inside Renée Rienne.

609
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:11,765
Nice work.

610
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,348
Well, if you were able to pull this off,

611
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,838
the rest should be easy.

612
00:41:16,972 --> 00:41:17,977
Yeah.

613
