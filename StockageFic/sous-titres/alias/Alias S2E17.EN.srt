1
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,384
Luri Karpachev.

2
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,764
He was a high-level arms dealer in Russia
with links to the Mafia. Your ex-wife says...

3
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,384
I'd appreciate it
if you'd refer to Irina Derevko by name.

4
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,312
Derevko listed him among former contacts

5
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,941
when she was debriefed by the NSA.

6
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,686
Yes, I've heard the name myself.

7
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,066
Sloane had dealings with him at SD-6.

8
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,859
I'll talk to Irina, see what she knows.

9
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,238
Sorry about the...

10
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,652
Don't be silly.

11
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,330
After you turned yourself in to the CIA,

12
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,999
you listed Luri Karpachev
as one of your former contacts.

13
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,289
He was murdered yesterday -
we believe by Sloane.

14
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,466
Karpachev's body was found
without his wallet.

15
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,469
Presumably Sloane has more
insidious ways to pass the time

16
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,630
than picking someone's pocket.

17
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,510
What might he have been looking for?

18
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:08,978
Why haven't you tried to convince Sydney
to leave the CIA?

19
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,274
You and I know better than anyone.

20
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,195
She should leave this life
while she has the chance.

21
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:21,107
Sydney can be stubborn.
Where she got that from is anyone's guess.

22
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,036
But she refuses to resign
as long as Sloane is still free,

23
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,658
which brings me back to my question.

24
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,868
What was in Karpachev's wallet?

25
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,285
A key card to his home safe.

26
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:38,084
In '93, Karpachev came into possession
of a Rambaldi manuscript.

27
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,209
Sloane must believe he kept it in his safe.

28
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,056
- But he's incorrect. Karpachev sold it.
- To whom?

29
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,185
Ilya Stuka, a former contact of mine,
living in Bangkok.

30
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,476
What is this manuscript?

31
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,137
Rambaldi's study of the human heart.

32
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:58,856
As you know, immortality was
one of Rambaldi's obsessions.

33
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,983
- Where does Stuka keep it?
- I don't know.

34
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:07,366
But I could find out,
if I were allowed to meet with him.

35
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:11,204
Kendall won't risk letting you out again
despite your cooperation in India.

36
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,997
What if the prize were worth it?

37
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,126
Sloane doesn't know you're in CIA custody.

38
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,924
He thinks I'm in hiding as he is.

39
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,387
If Sloane believes you've surfaced,
obtained the manuscript he's after,

40
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,798
he'll wanna meet with you,
negotiate a purchase...

41
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,727
- Which I'd be happy to do.
- And we could grab him.

42
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,014
And give Sydney her reason to get out.

43
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:45,192
OK. The key, obviously, is balance, right?
So don't worry so much about the puck

44
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,985
and just make sure your feet
are planted on the ice and then,

45
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,539
just a nice follow-through.

46
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,874
- Show-off.
- Yeah. A little bit.

47
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:04,005
Bristow's got the puck, she crosses the
blue line, she's at the top of the circle.

48
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,384
She shoots, she scores.

49
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,177
Oh, my God. What was that?

50
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,268
- I didn't say I was completely incompetent.
- But you've done this before.

51
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,097
No, I told you.
I haven't skated since I was five.

52
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:18,732
- No, I don't believe you.
- Swear to God. My mother took me.

53
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:29,408
- Well, you're better than you should be.
- Sooner or later, we're gonna have to have

54
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,200
- a conversation about my mother.
- There's nothing to talk about.

55
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,741
Sydney, there's nothing to say.
We both know what happened.

56
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,955
- What is there to say?
- I think a lot.

57
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,046
Nothing I wanna talk about.

58
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,251
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

59
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,348
Don't ever be sorry for her.

60
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,099
Hello?

61
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,766
Yeah.

62
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,932
OK.

63
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:05,939
- I have to go in.
- Of course you do. It's your day off.

64
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,982
All right. I'll see you later.

65
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,536
Yeah.

66
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,212
My name is Sydney Bristow.
You asked for me?

67
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,790
Yeah. Have a seat.

68
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:37,225
First off, I need your thumbprint
here and here, please.

69
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,306
These are just confidentiality agreements.

70
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,313
They just forbid you from disclosing
anything that we might talk about today.

71
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,609
If you do so, it's a felony.

72
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,918
Thank you.

73
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,844
Are you familiar with the name
Vladimir Progrowski?

74
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,425
No, I'm not.

75
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,355
You ever see this man?

76
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,857
No.

77
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,445
Last month you were in France
with Agent Michael Vaughn.

78
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:38,286
Do you recall seeing him
use the payphone?

79
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,406
No.

80
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,540
Did you see Mr Vaughn
purchase cigarettes?

81
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,333
Mr Vaughn doesn't smoke.

82
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,878
I understand.

83
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,173
No, I didn't see him buy cigarettes.

84
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,261
Are you and Mr Vaughn
intimately involved?

85
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,553
That's none of your business.

86
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,550
Yeah, I know.
It's sort of an awkward question.

87
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,351
What is this about?

88
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,770
I'd appreciate a little context here.
You haven't even given me your name.

89
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:05,356
I'm Mitchell Yeager.
I'm Counterintelligence - threat analyst.

90
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,650
That should give you a little context.

91
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,438
I've been sent here
to investigate Michael Vaughn.

92
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,450
It's come to our attention
that over the past three months

93
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:19,494
Mr Vaughn has been in contact with a
number of unapproved foreign operatives.

94
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,876
He's also actively pursuing contact
with Mr Progrowski,

95
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,714
who happens to be
a former KGB assassin,

96
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:30,001
known to have ties with
at least three terrorist organisations.

97
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:34,256
Wait a minute.
There absolutely... is a reason for this.

98
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,597
- I'm sure that's right. That's why I'm here.
- This is crazy.

99
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,842
What are you saying? Agent Vaughn
is working for someone else?

100
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,561
- That he... Who... He...
- Miss Bristow,

101
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,430
Mr Vaughn doesn't know an investigation
of this magnitude is taking place.

102
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:50,152
And I will remind you that speaking to him
about this is not only a criminal act,

103
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:54,567
but will force us
to consider you as a suspect as well.

104
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,818
So I'll ask you again.

105
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,074
Are you and Mr Vaughn intimate?

106
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,131
You suggest that we allow Irina Derevko,
a known terrorist,

107
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,800
to make contact with Arvin Sloane?

108
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,800
Sloane is searching for
another Rambaldi manuscript.

109
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,262
Irina believes it's now in the possession
of an associate living in Bangkok.

110
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:27,055
I'll serve as her escort, we'll recover
the manuscript and use it to bait Sloane.

111
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,558
I doubt I'll be able to convince
Washington to authorise it.

112
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:33,068
Our intel would have to be convincingly
precise and right now all we know

113
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:36,490
about this manuscript and where
it might be comes only from Derevko.

114
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,862
We may never have a better chance
to get Sloane.

115
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,280
Remember, without Irina's help
the operation in Kashmir

116
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:46,039
- would have been an embarrassment.
- Jack, when the hell did we switch places?

117
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:50,172
Derevko could be using those operations
just to convince us that she's trustworthy.

118
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:54,254
I've had 20 years to reflect on
that woman's ability to deceive.

119
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:59,385
Trust me. If she lies to me again,
I'll know it.

120
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:03,554
Stuka works out of a nightclub in Bangkok.
Why?

121
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,934
Did Kendall approve the op?

122
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,229
Yes, we have a jet standing by.

123
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,938
Oh, this is Marshall Flinkman.
He worked with us at SD-6.

124
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,941
Hey. How you doin'?

125
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,612
You're Sydney's mom.
That's really cool.

126
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,538
Cos your daughter...
Awesome, by the way.

127
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,825
Kendall insists you be injected
with a subdermal tracking device.

128
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,704
I'll have a receiver that will allow me
to follow your movements on site.

129
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,918
You won't even really know
that it's there unless, you know,

130
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,793
we put it under your thigh or somewhere
else where you might sit on it,

131
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,627
then you'll have
a "Princess and the Pea" moment,

132
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,261
where you feel it but you don't really...

133
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,172
You know that... "Princess and the Pea"?
My mother...

134
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:43,012
- Put it behind her shoulder.
- Oh. OK.

135
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:49,020
The thing is it might hurt a little bit
cos it's small, but it's not really that small.

136
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,653
Wow. You're tough.

137
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:09,996
Has Mr Vaughn made
any large purchases recently?

138
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,922
Not that I'm aware of.

139
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,293
Has he changed his cellphone
more than once in the past six months?

140
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:22,514
I've answered that. No. Why are you
asking me the same question twice?

141
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:26,643
We've traced four cellphones
back to Mr Vaughn since October.

142
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,301
I was hoping that
you would have noticed that.

143
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,144
I didn't.

144
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,398
Do you have private access
to his laptop computer?

145
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:34,149
Excuse me?

146
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,486
You know, while he's sleeping or in
the shower, or, you know, out of the house.

147
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,778
We don't live together.

148
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,740
Yeah. I understand that.

149
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,033
What are you asking me?

150
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,904
There's a decryption program
called Xenon

151
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,791
and we have reason to believe

152
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:54,585
that Mr Vaughn has downloaded this
program to his personal laptop computer,

153
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,958
- and if he has, he has broken the law.
- That's insane.

154
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:02,629
Well, maybe it is.
Then we need confirmation either way.

155
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:10,145
You want me to check Vaughn's computer.

156
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,808
We simply want you to make
a little disk image.

157
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:20,607
We want you to make a copy
of his hard drive and bring it back.

158
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,074
Listen to me. There is not a chance
that he is a traitor,

159
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,154
that he would be
collaborating with an enemy.

160
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,535
You know, I knew your mother.

161
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,080
About 20 years ago,
met her with your father.

162
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,288
We used to go to a lot of these
agency functions, you know.

163
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,460
She was a charming,
very disarming woman...

164
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,838
who wasn't what she seemed.

165
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,345
It is a mistake, Mr Yeager,
to confuse Michael Vaughn

166
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,474
with anything regarding my mother.

167
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,768
She killed his father.

168
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,766
I will not spy on Michael Vaughn.

169
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:59,559
Miss Bristow, what is your priority?

170
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:03,983
National security, or your new boyfriend?

171
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,163
- Weiss. Have you seen Vaughn?
- That's all I am to you.

172
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,962
- Just a conduit to Vaughn.
- I'm just...

173
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,621
Have you ever seen Vaughn
and said "Hey, where's Weiss?"

174
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,295
- I'm just looking for him.
- I haven't seen him.

175
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,801
I just got called to the briefing room.
You know what this is about?

176
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,380
- No.
- All right.

177
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,301
- See ya.
- Yeah. See ya.

178
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,225
Let her go. Play with me instead.

179
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,990
Stop it.

180
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,156
Why not? You know me.

181
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,832
I love games.

182
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,729
- Drop the gun.
- Do it.

183
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,816
You bought a Rambaldi manuscript
from Karpachev.

184
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,736
- I don't have it any more.
- Where is it?

185
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,781
In Hong Kong. I traded it for opium rights.

186
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,078
To who?

187
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,541
To Chang.

188
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:19,517
Once we get the manuscript, how do you
intend to let Sloane know it was you?

189
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:24,681
Word will get back to him that I was
in Bangkok. He'll know it was me.

190
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:31,067
I did not see that fourth man.

191
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,032
If you hadn't fired...

192
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,660
I remember the first time
you introduced me to Sloane.

193
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,540
You were both working at the CIA.

194
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:51,542
He came to the house for dinner.
You were true friends.

195
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:56,428
Yes. We shared a similar
unsentimental patriotism...

196
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,807
and a devotion to our wives.

197
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,726
But Sloane changed and...

198
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:09,608
It was Rambaldi that did it.
I'm not sure what it is - he never told me -

199
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:15,035
but Sloane has
a personal connection to Rambaldi.

200
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,691
I lived for years with the same obsession -

201
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:21,619
to find a higher meaning
in Rambaldi's work.

202
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:28,165
I never understood how you managed
to avoid getting caught up in it.

203
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,877
I had something neither of you did.

204
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,754
Sydney.

205
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,979
I never thanked you for everything that...

206
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,568
for raising our daughter.

207
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,908
We land in four hours. Get some rest.

208
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,546
Did you hear about your mother?
The operation they sent her on...

209
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,790
- Yeah, with my dad.
- How'd you find out about it?

210
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,838
- My dad told me.
- What was it? Courtesy or was it part of...

211
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,218
- No, he just told me.
- Isn't that weird to you?

212
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,382
That they wouldn't involve us at all?

213
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,515
The decision to reintroduce
Irina Derevko to the world,

214
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,346
and we're not consulted?

215
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,644
We can't be a part of every operation.

216
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:30,895
Well, this one we should have been.

217
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,477
I wouldn't read into it.

218
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:42,032
Yeah. You mind if I use your shower?

219
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,613
No, you don't have to ask.

220
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:45,093
OK. What I'm about to tell you,
you can't tell anybody. Swear to me.

221
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,261
I swear.

222
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:54,357
OK. Sydney. This is gonna sound insane.

223
00:19:56,654 --> 00:20:00,237
But she works for the CIA.

224
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:03,326
- Come on, seriously.
- Fran, think about it.

225
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,867
What bank sends their employees
on that many trips?

226
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:09,324
It's a cover job.
It's not even a good cover job, it's insane.

227
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:13,249
Those trips?
They're top-secret CIA missions.

228
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,618
Come on, Will.

229
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm telling you I have seen her in action.
She is like Schwarzenegger.

230
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:22,173
She's like the old Schwarzenegger.
She's amazing.

231
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:26,213
So what does that mean?
I mean, are you CIA too?

232
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,302
No.

233
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:31,680
- No, I'm an analyst.
- Really?

234
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,324
Hi.

235
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,203
Morning.

236
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,753
Where is everybody?

237
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:02,047
Sydney just went to work.
Francie left about 20 minutes ago.

238
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,966
- You OK?
- No, actually, I'm not.

239
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:16,018
I had this dream that I told Francie
everything I knew about the agency.

240
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,852
What do they have you working on?

241
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,435
Analysing drug trafficking
through the Panama Canal,

242
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,570
and I'm reading humint data,

243
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:26,156
and then downloading information
off the KH-11 satellite.

244
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:28,616
- Exciting, right?
- Yeah, I guess. Why?

245
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,614
Well, it's common to dream about work,

246
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,913
have anxiety over keeping it secret -
especially in the beginning.

247
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,281
- Really?
- Goes away, though.

248
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:37,378
- The excitement?
- No, the dreams.

249
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,423
You must allow us entry immediately.

250
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,005
Our mandate to search this location
has been approved by Beijing.

251
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,303
Any noncompliance
is a breach of your agreements.

252
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:00,652
I'm sorry for the delay.

253
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:04,782
Only this morning did we learn that an
inspection team was coming to the palace.

254
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:07,618
We're investigating reports
that precursor chemicals

255
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,825
have been stored in
several official buildings.

256
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:12,783
- If you are suggesting we are hiding...
- That will be for the inspectors to decide.

257
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:16,077
We are only here to conduct the interviews.
I'm sorry.

258
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,709
Let's go.

259
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:30,489
Did you speak to Will?
He was a little freaked out this morning.

260
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:33,780
- What was that?
- Just work stuff.

261
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:36,740
Come here.

262
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:49,756
Are you keeping secrets from me?

263
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,673
What?

264
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:55,762
- Answer the question.
- I'm sure I am.

265
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:58,888
We just started dating. Of course there's
things that I don't feel comfortable...

266
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,772
That's not... I'm not talking about us.

267
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,430
What, work then?
Yeah, there are certain things,

268
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:05,733
under protocol, that I'm not authorised
to talk about with anyone.

269
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,730
And that's it?

270
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:10,318
There is something
you don't know about me.

271
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:15,201
I don't like it when people question
my loyalty. It makes me insane.

272
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:19,617
This isn't about loyalty.
I never said anything about loyalty.

273
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:23,209
When you ask me if I'm keeping
secrets, the suggestion's pretty clear.

274
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:27,757
And you know what?
Secrets will be a problem between us.

275
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:32,385
After everything we've been through,
you should know that.

276
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:43,974
This is the key to my apartment. I was
gonna give it to you tonight at dinner.

277
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:47,068
Obviously an inappropriate move.

278
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,148
Vaughn.

279
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,991
Barnett's waiting for me.

280
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:09,966
- You made the right decision.
- That disk is blank.

281
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:13,136
I didn't make a copy of
Agent Vaughn's hard drive.

282
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:17,053
The fact that I doubted Vaughn's motives
makes me sick.

283
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:20,724
You should be aware that
by choosing not to assist

284
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:24,263
you are implicating yourself
in Agent Vaughn's activities.

285
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:27,809
- Don't threaten me again.
- You may be prosecuted as an accessory.

286
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:28,816
I understand.

287
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:31,477
Understand that there are
consequences to your actions.

288
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:34,823
There are consequences. That's my point.

289
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:39,121
Ask yourself.
Would you betray someone you love?

290
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:44,664
Well, I guess we have an answer
to the intimacy question.

291
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,845
- Mr Sloane.
- Yes.

292
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:02,425
It seems Irina Derevko
was seen last night in Bangkok.

293
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,605
- Where?
- At a club with llya Stuka.

294
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:16,826
Sark made contact through
one of Irina's email accounts.

295
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,906
He took the bait?

296
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:20,532
He wants a meeting to discuss
the purchase of the Rambaldi manuscript.

297
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:21,820
Can we trace his message?

298
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,824
No, it was sent through
anonymous remailers.

299
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:27,665
I'm going to set up the meeting in Panama,
ostensibly between Irina and Sloane.

300
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:31,004
Jack, you make this happen,
you can have my job.

301
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:33,249
No, thanks. I'll need Delta Force.

302
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:35,834
You'll get whatever you need.

303
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:59,070
Dad says you're going to Panama.

304
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:04,204
Do you think there's a chance
you'll get Sloane?

305
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,864
I wanted to see you because...

306
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:12,830
it's going to be dangerous setting this trap.

307
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:17,253
I hope it goes well.
But there's no guarantee.

308
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:24,637
So whatever happens,
there's something I need you to know.

309
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,972
Sydney, I love you.

310
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:35,484
- Mom.
- You don't have to say anything.

311
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:41,444
I'm pretty sure I haven't earned
very much and that's OK.

312
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:48,744
This was just something
I needed to say.

313
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:51,753
Mom, you're coming back.

314
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,914
I hope so.

315
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:16,027
Did you have any trouble
accessing the KH-11 satellite images?

316
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,686
- Was anyone suspicious?
- No.

317
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:23,863
I use them in my reports.
Nobody was suspicious.

318
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:28,749
The first image you saw...
see it in your mind.

319
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:32,534
- Do you see any markings?
- No, I don't think so.

320
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:36,876
Wait.

321
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:40,255
There are two sets of numbers
at the bottom right-hand corner.

322
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:42,752
Read them to me.

323
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,517
X8471.

324
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,676
GY79863.

325
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,015
What are they?

326
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:54,767
The orbital location of the satellite
and its operational controls.

327
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:57,275
Good.

328
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,441
I'm gonna count back from five.

329
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:05,780
When you wake up, you'll have
no memory of this conversation.

330
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:11,576
All you will remember is that tonight
you had the best sex of your life.

331
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,625
Five...

332
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:16,285
four...

333
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,706
three...

334
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,923
two...

335
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,125
one.

336
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,138
Based on our agreement, tomorrow
morning you and two Delta Force guards

337
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:35,726
will be dropped off here.

338
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:39,981
If Sloane follows the plan,
he'll drive north to meet you.

339
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:42,562
Won't he be suspicious
if I don't have the Rambaldi manuscript?

340
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:43,772
Sloane is smart enough to know

341
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:45,943
that you would never bring it with you
at first contact.

342
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:48,028
He'll expect you to have it close by.

343
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:51,075
CIA will be tracking you on satellite
back in Los Angeles,

344
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:54,285
in contact with me and the chopper
waiting ten blocks away.

345
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:58,292
When the call is made
the team will surround the vehicle

346
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:01,051
and ambush Sloane.

347
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:05,842
- Pretty straightforward.
- I think we've got a shot.

348
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,006
There's one thing.

349
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:13,260
- The tracker you put in my shoulder.
- You want it removed.

350
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:17,518
If they discover
I've been tagged, it's over.

351
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:19,685
We both know that.

352
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:25,070
Of course Kendall would have me
court-martialled for this.

353
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:28,075
Kendall is not as smart as you are.

354
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,954
Got it.

355
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,913
You OK?

356
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:43,333
This is nothing.

357
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,549
We need to be up early.

358
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:55,099
Yes.

359
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:59,392
We should get to bed.

360
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:02,435
Yeah, we should.

361
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:18,249
Hey. You know that thing we're both
involved in that we can't talk about?

362
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:19,795
I know a guy from the Farm
who works with Yeager

363
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,753
and he's about to file
a formal charge against Vaughn:

364
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,713
mishandling classified intelligence.

365
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,045
- What?
- Yeah.

366
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:26,249
I need to talk to him.

367
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:29,511
No, no, no... whoa. You do that
and you're breaking six different laws.

368
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:35,137
- He needs to know this is happening.
- But his phone is probably already tapped.

369
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:38,099
Agency cars are equipped
with GPS navigators.

370
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:41,226
- Can you access the system?
- Yeah.

371
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:59,457
- I found his car.
- Roger that. Keep me posted.

372
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:15,573
What are you doing here?

373
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:19,200
- Sydney.
- I asked you a question.

374
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,666
- What's going on?
- Don't tell me it was nothing.

375
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,992
- Are you following me?
- You just bought something.

376
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:26,953
- It's research.
- Research? What kind of research?

377
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:30,000
It's something private,
something just for me.

378
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:33,925
Who do you think you work for?
Nothing is private.

379
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:38,632
- You're being investigated.
- What?

380
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:42,594
When they find out I've told you,
I'll be a target.

381
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:44,978
So don't lie to me.

382
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:50,485
Sydney, I am not disloyal.

383
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:55,732
Then why do they say you've been
meeting with high-ranking FSB officers?

384
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:57,903
An ex-KGB assassin?

385
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,744
They have you in Istanbul,
Prague, Cracow, without authorisation.

386
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,208
Vaughn.

387
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:16,675
If there is some explanation for what
you've been doing the past four months,

388
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:18,841
I need to hear what it is.

389
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:22,302
Right now.

390
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:08,307
- They're at the location.
- KH-11 has 'em on screen.

391
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:12,108
There's a limousine
approaching from the southwest.

392
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:14,271
I see it.

393
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:26,700
It's Sark.

394
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,965
Delta team, stand by.

395
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:48,892
I realise the plan was for
Mr Sloane to meet with you here

396
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:51,687
but for security reasons,
I'm afraid that's impossible.

397
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:54,813
If you get in, I'll take you to him.

398
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:56,937
Only you.

399
00:35:58,491 --> 00:36:00,947
Why isn't she getting in?

400
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:05,119
- Where's Sloane?
- Close, I assure you.

401
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:07,579
- Then bring him to me.
- That's not an option.

402
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:10,870
- Then our deal's off.
- So be it.

403
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:17,630
Tell her to get in the car, dammit.
We'll track her to him.

404
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,795
It's a big car.

405
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:26,217
- I believe there's room for all of us.
- That wasn't the plan.

406
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:30,018
Get in.

407
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:36,609
He's letting her take the guards.
How did she pull that off?

408
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:51,165
Now I understand
why you were asking about secrets.

409
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:54,918
Yes. There is something I haven't told you.

410
00:36:55,006 --> 00:36:56,915
It hasn't been easy,

411
00:36:57,008 --> 00:37:02,844
accepting the idea that my job requires me
to... collaborate with my father's killer.

412
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:07,305
The fact that she happens to be
your mother didn't make it easier.

413
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:11,641
So I've been investigating her,
on my own for the past six months.

414
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:15,859
I couldn't wait for the agency's red tape
so I contacted everyone I could,

415
00:37:15,944 --> 00:37:18,482
anyone who knew her,
who ran in the same circles.

416
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:20,860
I...

417
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:24,532
I retraced sat phone records
that were logged...

418
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:27,110
while your mother was with you
in India and Kashmir,

419
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:29,957
tracked recorded conversations
between your mother's former lieutenants

420
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:33,541
to see if she signalled them
when Kendall gave her access to Echelon.

421
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:36,202
I don't understand. You wanted us
to work with her, you encouraged it.

422
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:39,085
Because I believed your father was
right about her having a secret agenda.

423
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:41,749
I wanted to see what she was going to do.

424
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:45,427
I mean, I did all of this on my own.
I paid for this myself.

425
00:37:45,515 --> 00:37:49,560
I had freelance agents retrace
every step of every hour she's taken

426
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:51,388
outside operations since her surrender.

427
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:54,433
I've surveilled prison guards
who were assigned to her cell block,

428
00:37:54,524 --> 00:37:56,315
the kitchen staff that prepares her meals.

429
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:58,192
They told me you downloaded Xenon.

430
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:01,978
I downloaded that program
to read KGB files.

431
00:38:02,073 --> 00:38:04,196
I had to find out
if she was deceiving us again.

432
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:06,609
I mean, I could not sleep at night
knowing I was doing nothing,

433
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:08,992
that somehow I was helping her.

434
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:39,526
We are visually tracking a moving target.
Delta team, stand by for go code.

435
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:47,193
- We've lost downlink.
- What the hell? Get back on line.

436
00:38:47,285 --> 00:38:49,361
Sir, someone's hacked the signal.

437
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:52,325
- Are the codes good?
- Yes.

438
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:54,908
Thank you.

439
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:58,504
Jack, we're blind. You're gonna
have to follow her from your end.

440
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:00,746
- Activate the tracking device.
- I can't.

441
00:39:03,176 --> 00:39:05,845
Send in the team.

442
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:08,846
Delta team, go.
Repeat, Delta team, go.

443
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:16,512
We've got 'em in sight.

444
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:34,362
We're tracking.

445
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:36,533
Stay with that car.

446
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:52,884
Lost visual. Got 'em again.

447
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:55,348
We're going to head 'em off.

448
00:40:11,953 --> 00:40:14,444
We got 'em stopped. Stand by.

449
00:40:48,865 --> 00:40:52,566
- Check the Rambaldi manuscript.
- Get me the Rambaldi manuscript now.

450
00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:06,167
Step out of the car, please.

451
00:41:13,264 --> 00:41:15,553
And did you find anything?

452
00:41:16,893 --> 00:41:19,811
Nothing. She's clean.

453
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:28,393
- Do you have the book?
- It's coming. It's coming.

454
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:04,730
It's good to see you again, Irina.

455
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,773
Thank you for extracting me.

456
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:38,465
Jack, it's gone.
