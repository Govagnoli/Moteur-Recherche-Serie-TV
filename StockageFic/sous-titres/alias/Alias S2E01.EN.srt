1
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:06,352
OK. I'm in.

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:09,393
Agent Bristow works undercover
with her father, Jack Bristow,

3
00:00:09,484 --> 00:00:11,393
also a double agent with CIA.

4
00:00:11,486 --> 00:00:12,565
Get down.

5
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:14,979
I guess we'll just have to learn
to trust each other.

6
00:00:15,073 --> 00:00:17,362
Bristow's CIA contact: Michael Vaughn.

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,324
My guardian angel.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,119
Her current assignment:
to infiltrate and destroy SD-6,

9
00:00:24,207 --> 00:00:27,540
a secret organisation
dealing in espionage, extortion,

10
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,703
weapon sales, posing as the CIA.

11
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:32,880
SD-6 has made over $400 million
in arms sales alone.

12
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,709
SD-6 director, Arvin Sloane.

13
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:38,964
The sanctity of this agency requires
the sacrifice of some personal freedoms.

14
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:45,473
This is not about cutting off an arm of the
monster. This is about killing the monster.

15
00:01:10,378 --> 00:01:13,130
You're Alexander Khasinau.

16
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,337
- You should eat something.
- I'm not hungry.

17
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:31,014
Wait.

18
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:36,856
- I have questions for you.
- You can ask my boss.

19
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:39,947
Your boss?

20
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,117
I thought the Man was the boss.

21
00:01:43,745 --> 00:01:46,414
Yes.

22
00:01:46,498 --> 00:01:49,867
Yes, but I'm not the Man.

23
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:15,144
I've waited almost 30 years for this.

24
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:21,110
Mom?

25
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:34,660
You must have known
this day would come.

26
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:40,918
I could have prevented all this, of course.

27
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,634
You were so small when you were born.
It would have been so easy.

28
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:50,477
Tell me,

29
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:54,770
Sydney, who sent you here?

30
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:59,108
You must tell me.

31
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:01,688
Or what?

32
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:05,900
I'm grounded.

33
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,959
Tell you what. Think about it.

34
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,959
I'll come back and ask you again.

35
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:33,891
You were shot by your mother?

36
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,356
- Yes.
- And you don't have a problem?

37
00:03:38,443 --> 00:03:41,064
No. What I mean by that...
Yes, of course I have problems.

38
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,108
The problems I have I can handle.

39
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:47,531
How did you escape?

40
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:49,410
I'm sorry, but Agent Vaughn is missing,

41
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:54,656
and my sitting here telling Houdini stories
to a CIA shrink, no offence, is pointless.

42
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:58,749
No one should be worrying about me.
It's him. We should all be looking for him.

43
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:02,373
You're frustrated
cos you're not part of the search team.

44
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:08,885
But, Sydney, they're looking, and you've
been ordered to come and talk to me.

45
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:16,053
I knew I couldn't get out of the room
until I got out of the chair.

46
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:19,599
It was an unreinforced aluminum chair.

47
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:40,374
I wedged it against a water valve,
put stress on the weld points.

48
00:04:57,814 --> 00:05:02,690
Getting past the door
was a little more complicated.

49
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:37,556
And you did all this
with a bullet in your shoulder?

50
00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:40,481
- Do you not believe me?
- It's impressive.

51
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:45,274
Not really. One thing I've learned doing
this: there's no drug like adrenaline.

52
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,001
Where the hell are you?

53
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:15,465
I'm in the middle of Taipei. I just got free.
Is Vaughn with you?

54
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:18,595
No. We haven't heard from him.
Sydney, you have to get to the plane, now.

55
00:06:18,686 --> 00:06:19,682
Dad, I have to go back for him.

56
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:22,974
There's no time. The Taiwanese
authorities will check this airstrip.

57
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:26,186
I can't leave him behind.
Hold the plane. I'm going back to the lab.

58
00:06:26,277 --> 00:06:28,400
Sydney, wait.

59
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:35,818
- Who's Vaughn?
- Tell me about Vaughn.

60
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:39,495
He's my CIA handler.

61
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:47,045
For a long time
he was the only person I could trust.

62
00:06:47,132 --> 00:06:50,216
I think that still might be the case.

63
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:56,422
Anyway, a good friend of mine - a civilian -
Will Tippin, was kidnapped.

64
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,683
Vaughn came to me.
He offered to help.

65
00:07:00,895 --> 00:07:04,347
So the two of us and my father
went to Taipei to get my friend back.

66
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:08,308
How did Vaughn go missing?

67
00:07:08,403 --> 00:07:13,112
The last time I saw Vaughn
was the night before my mother shot me.

68
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:17,742
While my father was paying a ransom
in exchange for my friend,

69
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:21,827
Vaughn and I went in to destroy
one of the kidnappers' research facilities.

70
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,285
We broke in through a club
in the building next door.

71
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,379
Along the way we split up.

72
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:31,335
When I got to the lab
I was supposed to destroy,

73
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:39,140
I found something unusual.

74
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:44,720
- What was it?
- The short answer is, I have no idea.

75
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:47,352
But there was no time, and I did my job.

76
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:57,404
By destroying Khasinau's lab,
I flooded the building.

77
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:45,406
And when you woke up you were
handcuffed to an aluminum chair.

78
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,498
After I escaped,
I went back to the last place I'd seen him.

79
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:53,455
There was a hazmat team
cleaning up the mess, testing the water.

80
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,041
I stole a suit and went in.

81
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:22,032
I found Vaughn's coat.

82
00:09:24,205 --> 00:09:28,951
When I finally made it back to the plane,
Vaughn still hadn't shown up.

83
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:39,795
OK. Easy.

84
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:46,302
What happened to the guy who shot you?

85
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:51,225
There was no guy.

86
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:54,684
It was Mom.

87
00:09:57,614 --> 00:10:00,401
And it didn't seem like
she worked for Khasinau.

88
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:02,650
It seems that Khasinau works for her.

89
00:10:02,744 --> 00:10:04,535
Excuse me, did you say
you were shot by your mother?

90
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:07,242
Sit down.

91
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,618
- Hello?
- Hey. Where are you?

92
00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:15,795
Just coming home
from San Francisco. What's up?

93
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:19,168
- Have you heard from Will?
- Have I heard from Will? No.

94
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,427
Me neither, and there's this story
on the news right now.

95
00:10:22,514 --> 00:10:25,799
Will wrote a story that wasn't supposed
to get printed unless he went missing.

96
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,683
What was Will's story about?

97
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:30,805
It was about the murder of your fiancé,
and some conspiracy,

98
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,305
and some group called SD-6.

99
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,977
What did you write about SD-6?

100
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:38,603
Nothing. Just the name. I don't even know
what it is. I just heard the name.

101
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:41,270
Why? Do you know what it is?
Is it a group?

102
00:10:41,366 --> 00:10:44,486
Are they good? Are they bad?
I mean, do you work with them?

103
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,819
Will was asking
all the questions I would ask.

104
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,700
What did you say to him?

105
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,412
Without going into details,
we told him the truth.

106
00:10:52,502 --> 00:10:57,211
That my father and I work for the CIA.
That we're working undercover at SD-6,

107
00:10:57,298 --> 00:11:00,714
one of a number of private agencies,
based in various countries,

108
00:11:00,802 --> 00:11:03,838
that trade in weapons,
drugs and intelligence.

109
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,801
That use covert means
to undermine governments and industry

110
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:09,429
in their attempts to take over the world.

111
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,428
So, what was his reaction?

112
00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:14,439
Seriously?

113
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:18,937
He thought it sounded preposterous.
Which is appropriate.

114
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:22,195
Did Will's article
put you in danger at SD-6?

115
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:26,030
My problems at SD-6
came from a different source.

116
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,702
As you're aware, I was shot last year,

117
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,707
while on a mission with Agent Bristow.

118
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,579
I was left with few memories of that day.

119
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,873
The doctors said
that type of memory loss was typical.

120
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:43,710
But then, last week,
I remembered something.

121
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:48,714
And I remembered Agent Bristow trying
to save my life using a Satcom radio.

122
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:55,558
What was unusual was that she ID'd
herself with a call sign not issued by SD-6.

123
00:11:55,648 --> 00:12:00,145
Call sign "Freelancer". Last Thursday
night, I followed Agent Bristow.

124
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:06,072
I watched as she illegally gained access
to an SD-6 facility in Santa Barbara.

125
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,287
I prayed, sir,
that there was an explanation.

126
00:12:10,371 --> 00:12:14,950
But when I confronted Sydney,
she had none.

127
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:18,749
As a servant of this country,

128
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:23,547
despite the fact it breaks my heart to do so,

129
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:27,929
I must report that I believe
Sydney Bristow to be a double agent.

130
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:32,301
My father, of course, anticipated this.

131
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:35,347
You and I need to assume
Dixon's reported you.

132
00:12:35,438 --> 00:12:38,523
The best move for us
is for me to take full responsibility.

133
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:40,601
What about Will?

134
00:12:41,903 --> 00:12:44,572
You're gonna have a hard time.

135
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,442
Then we landed and went back to SD-6.

136
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:52,323
As my father predicted,
they took me into custody.

137
00:12:52,413 --> 00:12:54,121
That's when he went to see Sloane.

138
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,828
You gave Sydney the call sign
"Freelancer".

139
00:12:56,918 --> 00:12:59,041
- Yes. That's right.
- Why?

140
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:03,126
Because I didn't trust you.
Consider it a paternal instinct.

141
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,707
I'm only telling you now
because of Tippin's article.

142
00:13:05,802 --> 00:13:08,803
I should have had Tippin killed
months ago.

143
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:16,182
Tippin's kidnapping led us directly to
Khasinau. Sydney destroyed their facility.

144
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:18,512
Now Khasinau's organisation is fractured.

145
00:13:18,606 --> 00:13:23,067
Those who didn't lose their lives
are on the run. This is an opportunity.

146
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,644
I understand that I broke protocol,

147
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:30,689
that the Alliance would have me killed
for what I have done,

148
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:34,783
but if I weren't loyal to you, Arvin,

149
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:38,455
to SD-6, I would not have returned.

150
00:13:39,294 --> 00:13:40,456
What about Tippin?

151
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:43,001
Tippin's insignificant.
He doesn't know anything.

152
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,758
And you can't kill him now,
it'll only call attention.

153
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:49,674
I will see to it
that he never writes another article again.

154
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:09,655
Sloane just talked to me.

155
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:14,154
There are times in life,

156
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:18,409
when we don't listen to our heart,

157
00:14:20,043 --> 00:14:22,913
to what we know to be true.

158
00:14:23,004 --> 00:14:27,999
In those moments we've lost who we are.

159
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:31,876
We've betrayed ourselves.

160
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:39,268
Questioning your loyalty, your virtue,

161
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:42,105
was one of those lost times for me.

162
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,616
Dixon is a good man.

163
00:14:56,746 --> 00:15:03,413
He still believes, as I once did,
that SD-6 is a classified division of the CIA.

164
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,750
That's the hardest part
about working undercover.

165
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:13,005
Having to lie
to the people that you care about.

166
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:20,559
- Anything from Vaughn?
- Nothing.

167
00:15:20,645 --> 00:15:23,397
- What the hell's being done?
- We got a team in Taipei.

168
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:26,518
They searched the warehouse.
They're tracking every lead possible.

169
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:28,935
- Don't give that to me.
- This is called the best that we can do.

170
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:33,358
- Vaughn might not even be in Taipei.
- I understand that. He's my friend too.

171
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,447
Sydney, I promise you,
we're looking as hard as we can.

172
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:41,072
I know this is tough for you,
but you have to focus. We have a job to do.

173
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,870
I know.

174
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,914
SD-6 wants to send me
on a mission to Cap Ferrat, France.

175
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:48,582
Why? What's there?

176
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,207
La Petite Rose,

177
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:55,548
the estate of Jean-Marc Revet,
member of the French national assembly.

178
00:15:55,638 --> 00:16:00,099
Since the destruction of Khasinau
and Derevko's headquarters in Taipei -

179
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:04,134
thank you, Sydney - some members
of their organisation have been exposed.

180
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,890
Revet is one of those men.

181
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:08,271
We believe he helped to finance
their operation,

182
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:11,978
and is the key to finding Khasinau,
your mother,

183
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,357
others who have worked with them,
and bringing them to justice.

184
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,481
"Bringing them to justice."

185
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:21,037
I love that - Arvin Sloane talking about
justice. What does Sloane want you to do?

186
00:16:21,122 --> 00:16:25,701
Your mission is to gain entry into
Revet's house, plant a bug in his office.

187
00:16:25,794 --> 00:16:29,209
Assuming that you're feeling up to it.

188
00:16:29,297 --> 00:16:31,254
I'll be fine.

189
00:16:33,885 --> 00:16:36,506
- Marshall.
- Thank you.

190
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:40,380
Anyway, OK,
what we have here is a phone.

191
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:42,467
You might find, you know, talking...

192
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,095
"Hello. Mom. Yeah.
Mom, no, I will be there. It's just..."

193
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:49,937
"Listen, is Aunt Ruthie gonna be there?"

194
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:56,570
Ubiquitous object with infinite designs,
colour, wiring, components.

195
00:16:56,658 --> 00:16:59,065
Guy like me,
designing a bug for a phone like this?

196
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,739
First I have to figure out what type of model
the phone is that I'm bugging.

197
00:17:03,832 --> 00:17:07,247
And then I have to design it so
it's invisible. No more bugging phones.

198
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:12,330
All right. Welcome to a new age in
wiretapping. This bug, it's in the wire.

199
00:17:12,423 --> 00:17:16,338
It's a universal design,
works on any phone, adjustable frequency.

200
00:17:16,427 --> 00:17:20,295
All you gotta know is what country
the phone's in. In this case, <i>la France. </i>

201
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,217
How you doin'?

202
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:27,136
Bug's in the wire. That's good. We'll get
CIA Tech to make you a delay transmitter.

203
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:32,604
That way we can control what SD-6 gets
to hear and, meanwhile, CIA hears it all.

204
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,731
Listen, about Vaughn - I'm praying too.

205
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:44,579
So now, instead of going back to Taipei,

206
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,582
instead of helping in
the search for Vaughn,

207
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,541
I'm leaving for France in half an hour.

208
00:17:49,627 --> 00:17:54,835
One more thing. You haven't said
anything about your mother.

209
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:04,470
What am I supposed to say?
Something insightful?

210
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,975
The first time I see my mother in 20 years
and she almost kills me.

211
00:18:08,062 --> 00:18:11,811
Which would have made me
the 13th CIA officer she's killed.

212
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,521
She's former KGB.
She's betrayed my father.

213
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:17,102
She's betrayed me.
She's betrayed this country.

214
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:21,609
All anyone needs to know about
that woman is that she's a bad guy.

215
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:25,028
I think this was a good beginning.

216
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:29,783
Like I said,
I can handle the problems I've got.

217
00:18:51,773 --> 00:18:54,690
Dr Khasinau, Mr Revet is calling.

218
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:27,551
- Bluebird. You close?
- Almost there.

219
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,938
- Dammit.
- You all right?

220
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:40,601
Just my shoulder. I'm good.

221
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,453
OK. We're good at stage one.
Hors d'oeuvres are tasty.

222
00:19:55,545 --> 00:19:59,459
Don't forget now, you can always bring me
back a few. Can you get upstairs?

223
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:02,384
I think so.

224
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:13,389
- Second door on the right?
- Yes. Second door on the right.

225
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:34,239
- What's up? We got a signal?
- Yeah. We got a signal.

226
00:20:40,215 --> 00:20:42,788
OK. Let's let SD-6 hear that.

227
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,922
I got you, Bluebird.
Get out of there.

228
00:21:22,173 --> 00:21:25,174
- I'll be finished in 20 minutes.
- Yes, sir.

229
00:22:53,765 --> 00:22:57,928
Vaughn, you have to get up.
We have to get out of here.

230
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:03,313
Come on. Come on,
they're gonna be back in a second.

231
00:23:09,531 --> 00:23:11,073
Syd?

232
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:22,499
I'm so sorry. I'm gonna shoot you
with adrenaline. We have got to run.

233
00:23:22,585 --> 00:23:25,255
Don't do that.

234
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:36,295
Come on. Come on. Come on.

235
00:23:40,228 --> 00:23:42,304
Grab them.

236
00:23:51,114 --> 00:23:53,106
- That hurt.
- I'm sorry.

237
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:55,821
Don't be. Where are we?

238
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,694
- France.
- France? Really? France.

239
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:04,083
There's too much to explain. I have
to get back before Dixon comes after me.

240
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:07,502
You can get back to Los Angeles, right?

241
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:11,091
- What?
- You saved my life.

242
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:15,970
I'll see you back in LA.

243
00:24:32,822 --> 00:24:38,065
So the operation in France must
have gone well. Your spirits seem lifted.

244
00:24:38,161 --> 00:24:42,289
The doctor said
Vaughn's gonna be all right, so...

245
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:49,624
OK. I see what you're thinking,
and the answer is no.

246
00:24:49,714 --> 00:24:51,790
There is no line being crossed.

247
00:24:51,883 --> 00:24:57,339
He's my handler. Vaughn and I have
a professional relationship. That's it.

248
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:01,262
Well, actually, I was thinking about
your reporter friend.

249
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:12,604
Will isn't doing so well.

250
00:25:12,695 --> 00:25:14,522
In Taipei he was tortured.

251
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:17,152
But, I think, in some ways
things have gotten even worse for him.

252
00:25:17,242 --> 00:25:20,990
The only way SD-6 will let you live
is if you destroy the life you've got.

253
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:25,373
I understand that, but you can't think
of another way than this?

254
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:31,082
Yes, I can think of a number of other ways,
but they all involve your burial.

255
00:25:31,172 --> 00:25:35,336
Is that your idea of a joke?
You're morbid, Jack.

256
00:25:39,222 --> 00:25:44,263
You'll be taken to a drug house in South
Central. An hour later there will be a raid.

257
00:25:44,352 --> 00:25:48,564
Remember, the most critical thing
is that you face the press yourself.

258
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:52,349
If you don't go public with this,
you'll be a dead man.

259
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:56,226
I'm scared.

260
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:00,816
I know.

261
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,659
You ready?

262
00:26:46,915 --> 00:26:51,078
- Heroin?
- Francie, I'll explain everything later. OK?

263
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:56,590
Then we should go out the back, cos
there's a bunch of reporters waiting for you.

264
00:26:56,674 --> 00:26:58,299
No. I wanna go out the front.

265
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:00,673
- There he is.
- Mr Tippin?

266
00:27:00,762 --> 00:27:03,087
Is it true you were found
with heroin in your blood?

267
00:27:03,181 --> 00:27:04,972
Will, give us some sort of statement.

268
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:08,391
My problem with heroin
goes back three years.

269
00:27:08,478 --> 00:27:11,265
I'm embarrassed for myself
and for my family

270
00:27:11,356 --> 00:27:15,104
when I tell you that most of what I've written
during that time has been complete fiction.

271
00:27:15,193 --> 00:27:21,397
Including my most recent report about
an organisation that I called SD-6.

272
00:27:21,491 --> 00:27:23,982
These were desperate att...

273
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:30,245
As hard as that is to watch,
your friend is very lucky.

274
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:33,500
It could have ended up much worse.

275
00:27:33,586 --> 00:27:37,798
You know how much I care about you,
Sydney.

276
00:27:37,882 --> 00:27:41,500
I did it for you - spared Will's life.

277
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:45,841
I didn't want to see you lose
someone else to SD-6.

278
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:48,842
Thank you.

279
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:52,344
There is something else.

280
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:54,597
Something I wanna ask you.

281
00:27:56,192 --> 00:28:01,946
It would mean a great deal to me
if you would speak at Emily's service.

282
00:28:16,504 --> 00:28:19,754
- You OK?
- Fantastic.

283
00:28:31,102 --> 00:28:33,593
He's in the bathroom.

284
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:40,944
- How bad?
- It's just bad.

285
00:28:43,573 --> 00:28:46,693
Look, I have to meet with my realtor.

286
00:28:48,077 --> 00:28:50,651
I'll be back in an hour.
Can you watch him?

287
00:28:50,747 --> 00:28:52,823
Yeah.

288
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,041
He's gonna be OK.

289
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,794
I was just sitting there, putting my stuff
from my desk into this cardboard box.

290
00:29:07,472 --> 00:29:11,801
And I look up, and everybody
from the office is just staring at me.

291
00:29:11,893 --> 00:29:15,179
So I left my office this afternoon
for, like, the last time.

292
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:18,854
But I got a lot of, like "Take care, man."
I got a lot of that.

293
00:29:18,942 --> 00:29:22,560
- I'm so sorry, Will.
- I'm...

294
00:29:23,404 --> 00:29:27,817
I'm sitting here.
I'm on a couch, I'm alive.

295
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,165
Is anyone listening to us right now?

296
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,622
No.

297
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,755
That lamp has a bug killer in it,
so we're safe here.

298
00:29:43,258 --> 00:29:46,212
How's your mouth?

299
00:29:46,302 --> 00:29:49,339
I'm gonna be fine.

300
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:54,805
Of course, I lose my health insurance
the same day I need a root canal.

301
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:05,392
Who is it?

302
00:30:05,488 --> 00:30:09,356
Just say good guys or bad guys,
I'll understand.

303
00:30:09,451 --> 00:30:11,527
Good guys.

304
00:30:24,048 --> 00:30:26,670
When I was a kid, I was a swimmer.

305
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:30,888
I could swim the hundred metres
in 68 seconds.

306
00:30:30,972 --> 00:30:35,848
I can't tell you how irrelevant that was
that night we were in Taipei.

307
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:40,265
There have been some pretty incredible
inventions over the last 2,000 years,

308
00:30:40,356 --> 00:30:45,018
but none more incredible
than the screwdriver. None.

309
00:30:57,332 --> 00:30:59,823
I thought I was home free.

310
00:31:02,837 --> 00:31:06,087
But they knocked me out.
Next thing I knew, I was in France.

311
00:31:06,174 --> 00:31:10,919
When I saw you behind that window,
I swear to God, I thought you were dead.

312
00:31:16,392 --> 00:31:19,310
We just intercepted a call
from one of Khasinau's operatives.

313
00:31:19,395 --> 00:31:22,562
- He made reference to "the Bible".
- What is it?

314
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:25,519
A book, an operations manual
for their whole cartel -

315
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,603
contacts, weapons and tech inventory,
objectives.

316
00:31:27,695 --> 00:31:32,192
It's information Khasinau and your mother
need to rebuild their operation.

317
00:31:32,283 --> 00:31:35,201
If we retrieve this book,
we can prevent that.

318
00:31:35,286 --> 00:31:37,742
- Any idea where this "Bible" is?
- It was Taipei.

319
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:39,954
Apparently,
when the lab was being destroyed,

320
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:43,042
this operative, who called Khasinau,
grabbed the book, kept it safe.

321
00:31:43,128 --> 00:31:45,453
He's planning on handing it
to Khasinau tomorrow afternoon,

322
00:31:45,547 --> 00:31:48,631
at the Port of Barcelona, pier 347.

323
00:31:48,716 --> 00:31:51,290
- Does SD-6 know about this?
- That's what's so genius.

324
00:31:51,386 --> 00:31:54,837
The delay transmitter you planted?
Lets us control the signal SD-6 receives.

325
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:56,556
We didn't let 'em hear the call.

326
00:31:56,641 --> 00:32:01,766
You're going to Spain to intercept the book.
You leave in 30 minutes.

327
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,277
- Anything?
- Not yet.

328
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:22,036
You know, there's some
really good restaurants in Barcelona.

329
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,916
Yeah. I know.

330
00:32:24,002 --> 00:32:27,003
- You know what I was thinking?
- I think I do.

331
00:32:27,088 --> 00:32:29,377
If we could actually
be seen in public together,

332
00:32:29,466 --> 00:32:31,292
we could get the Bible and get a bite.

333
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:35,797
Yeah. Can the whole team come?
Cos we're starving.

334
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:51,810
OK. We've got Khasinau.

335
00:33:08,838 --> 00:33:13,631
Everyone hold position.
Get ready to move.

336
00:33:29,943 --> 00:33:34,190
The courier's got a briefcase.
It's got to be the Bible.

337
00:33:38,993 --> 00:33:41,615
We move in on three.

338
00:33:41,704 --> 00:33:44,705
Everybody into position.

339
00:33:53,508 --> 00:33:55,216
One.

340
00:33:56,469 --> 00:33:58,462
Two.

341
00:33:59,556 --> 00:34:03,767
Out of the car.
Let me see your hands. Drop the case.

342
00:34:07,856 --> 00:34:09,848
- Drop the case.
- Let me see your hands.

343
00:34:09,941 --> 00:34:12,017
Out of the car. Come on.

344
00:34:12,569 --> 00:34:15,772
Throw it down. Throw it down.

345
00:34:33,214 --> 00:34:34,590
Who the hell is firing?

346
00:34:34,674 --> 00:34:36,797
Weiss, I'm going after the shooter.
Cover me.

347
00:34:36,885 --> 00:34:40,170
Bravo Team, you take the dry dock to
the west. Charlie Team, take it to the east.

348
00:34:49,022 --> 00:34:51,976
It's OK. It's OK. Relax.

349
00:35:27,143 --> 00:35:29,717
Freeze.

350
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,648
Drop the suitcase.

351
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:37,980
Hands behind your head.
On your knees.

352
00:36:11,354 --> 00:36:13,430
Drop it.

353
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,531
Hands behind your head.

354
00:37:09,621 --> 00:37:12,028
Get on your knees.

355
00:37:21,758 --> 00:37:23,834
Head to the ground.

356
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,186
Truth takes time.

357
00:38:14,394 --> 00:38:17,146
- Do you have a minute?
- You all right?

358
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:24,778
- Have you heard?
- What? Sit down.

359
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:38,914
I had Emily's funeral this morning -
Sloane's wife.

360
00:38:39,002 --> 00:38:42,667
- You're eulogising the bastard's wife?
- Yes.

361
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:46,670
The devil's wife.
The wife of the guy who had Danny killed.

362
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:49,630
The guy who wanted to kill me.

363
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:55,593
Despite being married to a truly horrible
man, Emily was a good person.

364
00:38:55,685 --> 00:38:58,852
And if the people who cared about her
don't speak at her funeral because of him,

365
00:38:58,938 --> 00:39:00,730
there's no justice in that.

366
00:39:00,815 --> 00:39:03,650
It just makes him stronger.

367
00:39:04,944 --> 00:39:07,981
You can't see this bruise, right?

368
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:16,159
So this is what your life is -
lying to everybody all the time.

369
00:39:16,915 --> 00:39:21,078
I've only been doing it for a few days
and it's killing me.

370
00:39:21,169 --> 00:39:26,590
When you found out about me,
I was just terrified,

371
00:39:26,674 --> 00:39:31,917
because I saw what happened
when Danny learned the truth.

372
00:39:32,013 --> 00:39:37,636
But I was also, selfishly, so relieved,

373
00:39:37,727 --> 00:39:43,765
because it meant that you knew, that
I didn't have to think every time we spoke.

374
00:39:43,858 --> 00:39:46,895
I could just be me.

375
00:39:46,986 --> 00:39:49,275
Hello?

376
00:39:49,364 --> 00:39:51,356
Back here.

377
00:39:51,449 --> 00:39:53,525
No bruises.

378
00:39:57,664 --> 00:40:00,036
I got the space.
I'm opening a restaurant.

379
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:01,868
- Congratulations.
- That's great.

380
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,787
Thank you.

381
00:40:06,214 --> 00:40:12,217
I met Emily shortly after
I started working at Credit Dauphine.

382
00:40:12,303 --> 00:40:17,974
Like many young women,
I was intimidated by the world.

383
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:20,728
I was sort of desperate for a little guidance.

384
00:40:20,812 --> 00:40:25,853
As he had been for most of my life,
my father was busy working.

385
00:40:25,942 --> 00:40:29,691
I'd lost my mother when I was six,

386
00:40:29,779 --> 00:40:33,694
so I didn't have anyone to go to,

387
00:40:33,783 --> 00:40:35,527
no role model.

388
00:40:35,618 --> 00:40:39,118
Arvin invited me for dinner one night.

389
00:40:40,582 --> 00:40:43,951
I remember, after dinner was over,

390
00:40:45,378 --> 00:40:48,664
Emily walked me out to the car.

391
00:40:50,258 --> 00:40:52,500
I didn't know her at all.

392
00:40:53,261 --> 00:40:58,884
And she said
in this simple, reassuring voice:

393
00:41:01,478 --> 00:41:04,147
"You're gonna be OK."

394
00:41:08,443 --> 00:41:11,859
Thinking of Emily,
I often wondered about my own mother,

395
00:41:11,946 --> 00:41:17,451
and what she would have been like,
had she lived.

396
00:41:18,912 --> 00:41:24,701
Would she have been as strong as Emily,
or as kind, as good?

397
00:41:27,128 --> 00:41:31,256
I always told myself that
she would have had those qualities,

398
00:41:31,341 --> 00:41:34,792
even though I couldn't see them.

399
00:41:34,886 --> 00:41:37,175
I simply believed them.

400
00:41:37,263 --> 00:41:41,427
But Emily wasn't just
the mother I never had.

401
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:46,638
She was the mother
all of us wish we had.

402
00:42:14,384 --> 00:42:16,258
Dad?

403
00:42:16,344 --> 00:42:20,389
Devlin just called.
The CIA had a walk-in.

404
00:42:22,434 --> 00:42:27,973
She just surrendered.
She said she wants to cooperate.

405
00:42:28,064 --> 00:42:29,227
Who?

406
00:42:31,693 --> 00:42:33,851
Your mother.

407
00:42:44,414 --> 00:42:49,242
I'm not sure this is a problem
I know how to handle.
