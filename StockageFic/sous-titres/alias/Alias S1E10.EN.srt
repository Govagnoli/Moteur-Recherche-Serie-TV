1
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:05,648
My name is Sydney Bristow.

2
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:10,820
Seven years ago, I was recruited
by a branch of the CIA called SD-6.

3
00:00:10,903 --> 00:00:14,490
I was sworn to secrecy, but I
couldn't keep it from my fiancé.

4
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:17,993
And when the head of SD-6
found out, he had him killed.

5
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:23,124
That's when I learned the truth,
SD-6 is not part of the CIA.

6
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:26,418
I'd been working for the people
I thought I was fighting.

7
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:29,672
I went to the only place
that could help me take them down.

8
00:00:29,755 --> 00:00:34,969
Now, I'm a double agent for the CIA,
where my handler is Michael Vaughn.

9
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:41,434
Only one other person knows what
I do. Another double agent in SD-6.

10
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:44,019
Someone I hardly know.

11
00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:45,729
My father.

12
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:03,956
Who killed Kurtz?
Who killed Hecht?

13
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:06,792
Whoever did that
gave Eloise Kurtz that pin.

14
00:01:06,876 --> 00:01:09,753
- It's on.
- Ring him back right now.

15
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:13,507
You have questions
about Kate Jones.

16
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:16,552
How far are you willing to go,
Mr Tippin?

17
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:18,220
I need to hear the words.

18
00:01:19,305 --> 00:01:21,390
It's an anomaly, sir.

19
00:01:22,057 --> 00:01:24,101
While Sydney was in the bank vault,

20
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:27,271
there was an additional transmission
out of Geneva.

21
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,231
You've been sent to find a mole.

22
00:01:29,732 --> 00:01:32,651
When I look at Sydney's test results,
I don't see a spike.

23
00:01:32,735 --> 00:01:33,861
She didn't falter.

24
00:01:33,944 --> 00:01:36,864
Sydney Bristow is the mole.

25
00:01:50,252 --> 00:01:52,463
- Yeah?
- We got her.

26
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:34,672
We've known for some time
that we had a mole.

27
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,466
That someone was working against us.

28
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,219
When you were in Geneva
with Agent Bristow,

29
00:02:40,302 --> 00:02:43,597
we picked up a transmission.
Third party.

30
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:47,226
It confirmed what some in Security
Section believed for weeks.

31
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:50,354
That Agent Bristow was that mole.

32
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,109
When you were in the field with
Bristow, there was no indication?

33
00:02:55,192 --> 00:02:56,819
Nothing.

34
00:02:58,737 --> 00:03:01,949
We need to determine
the extent of damage done to us.

35
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:03,451
What can I do?

36
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:06,871
Convince Bristow that we believe
you are working together

37
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:10,291
and that if she won't tell us
what she's done,

38
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:12,460
we'll torture you to death.

39
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,130
Will that work?

40
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:20,092
Threat to colleagues is a
fundamental interrogation technique.

41
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:24,180
Sydney in particular.

42
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:30,019
Yes, I think that she will respond.

43
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:35,566
Mr Russek?

44
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:39,779
We need to make it appear
that you were questioned.

45
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:06,430
- They think I'm part of this.
- What do you mean?

46
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:10,434
Don't play games with me.
You know what I'm talking about.

47
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:15,106
A transmission was sent
from our position in Geneva.

48
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:19,527
At the bank.
They know it was one of us.

49
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:24,031
They want to know how much damage
has been done to them.

50
00:04:24,115 --> 00:04:27,326
There's only one person
that can answer that question.

51
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:31,497
Sydney, I don't know
who you're working for.

52
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,416
But I need you to tell them
what you know.

53
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:37,920
They said they were gonna kill me.

54
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:40,840
Slowly.

55
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:47,596
- Do you believe them?
- They're not bluffing.

56
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:50,808
Do you believe them?

57
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:53,185
Yes.

58
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,409
Has Sydney Bristow moved her desk?

59
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:11,745
No, Security Section cleared it out
an hour ago.

60
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:19,044
Get on your knees,
put your heads to the floor. Now.

61
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:26,594
Sloane wants to know
if you're ready to talk.

62
00:05:34,393 --> 00:05:37,980
No. Tell him I have nothing to say.

63
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,991
Steven, what's going on?
Talk to me.

64
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:50,910
- What do you know?
- What do I know?

65
00:05:50,993 --> 00:05:53,245
- Talked to Sloane?
- I came to you first.

66
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:54,789
Jack, do me a favour...

67
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:57,458
I need you to tell me
what's happening.

68
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,003
You didn't hear this from me.

69
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,715
While Sydney and Russek
were in Geneva,

70
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,009
a transmission was recorded.

71
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:10,471
- It was not one of ours.
- They think it was Sydney?

72
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:13,224
This is not the first indication
that she

73
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:15,893
might be working
for someone else.

74
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,645
What exactly do they know?

75
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,444
Jack, I'm sorry.

76
00:07:30,426 --> 00:07:32,344
My name is Sydney Bristow.

77
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,973
I've seen you in the office.

78
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,017
I always wondered what you did.

79
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:43,898
I guess this is what you do.

80
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:13,052
Sir, I think you should see this.

81
00:08:39,078 --> 00:08:41,914
All I'm saying is,
maybe you and I should talk

82
00:08:41,997 --> 00:08:44,625
before we get started.

83
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:29,503
Change of plans.

84
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:34,341
For the past few weeks,
you've been under suspicion.

85
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:36,177
We knew we had a mole.

86
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:39,764
There were signs
that indicated that it was you.

87
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:41,223
When you were in Geneva,

88
00:09:41,307 --> 00:09:43,976
we picked up
a third-party transmission.

89
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:46,687
It seemed to confirm
that you betrayed SD-6.

90
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:53,068
Now what I just learned is
that it wasn't your transmission.

91
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:54,570
It was Russek's.

92
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:56,697
Russek?

93
00:09:57,281 --> 00:10:01,285
What is this?
What the hell is going on?

94
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,913
I wanna talk to Sloane!

95
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,124
No.

96
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:19,428
Sydney, I never believed
that you would betray us.

97
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:23,557
When I realised that it was
Russek who was the mole...

98
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:26,769
...I felt vindicated.

99
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:43,494
- That's impossible.
- I know.

100
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:46,622
In Geneva, Russek
was transmitting to K-Directorate

101
00:10:46,705 --> 00:10:49,500
at the same time
you were transmitting to the CIA?

102
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,795
And that SD-6 picked up
his transmission, not mine.

103
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:56,549
There's no record of contact between
him and Russian intelligence.

104
00:10:56,632 --> 00:11:00,928
In the cell, I asked him questions
about his interrogation.

105
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:04,390
When he said they threatened
to kill him, he was blinking.

106
00:11:04,473 --> 00:11:06,767
A classic indication
that he was lying.

107
00:11:06,851 --> 00:11:10,271
So I didn't talk because I knew
he wasn't in real danger.

108
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:13,441
Either Sloane still thinks
I'm the mole...

109
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:17,236
If Sloane still suspected you,
he wouldn't let you go free.

110
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:19,613
Or two, Russek is K-Directorate.

111
00:11:19,697 --> 00:11:22,867
- Or three...
- Russek was a sacrificial lamb.

112
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,454
That he was innocent
and was set up to get me out.

113
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:30,875
At first, I thought
maybe it was the CIA.

114
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,043
It wasn't us.

115
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:36,547
The truth is, Russek
could have been K-Directorate.

116
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,050
So let's just assume
you're the luckiest girl in town.

117
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:42,428
Sorry that I called you
at the weekend.

118
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:44,221
I needed to talk to you.

119
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:48,142
You don't ever have to apologise
for calling. Speaking of which,

120
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:52,563
- I got you something.
- What? No, you didn't!

121
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:56,776
I was in this store,
this little antique place.

122
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:00,029
What were you doing
in an antique store?

123
00:12:00,112 --> 00:12:05,117
I don't know. Whatever. Look,
if you don't like it, don't tell me.

124
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:06,494
OK.

125
00:12:06,577 --> 00:12:08,746
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

126
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:13,209
- Is "hard" a word?
- It's crazy.

127
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:15,503
- Time's up.
- Hold on.

128
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:16,587
Will?

129
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,964
- Who goes first?
- OK, Amy?

130
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:20,716
- No, Will.
- OK.

131
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,136
- Numps.
- That's not a word. I challenge.

132
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,472
- I think it is.
- Numps is totally a word.

133
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:28,307
You're questioning this?

134
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,643
Here. "Numps.
A fool, a blockhead."

135
00:12:30,726 --> 00:12:32,853
Alright. Your brother's so annoying.

136
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:35,731
- I got numps, too.
- What? Damn it!

137
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:37,066
Dude.

138
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:42,530
I gotta go to work. I'm sorry.

139
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:47,034
OK, can we all have a talk
about what you do for a living?

140
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:49,120
I know. These bankruptcies.

141
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:52,998
It doesn't make sense any more.
Nobody works as hard as you.

142
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:56,836
It's not like you're a brain surgeon,
you get called to save a life.

143
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:00,172
Bankruptcies. How much do
they pay you to live like this?

144
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:01,799
Not enough.

145
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,260
I'm gonna call them and quit for you.

146
00:13:04,343 --> 00:13:06,512
- Will, I can't quit my job.
- Why?

147
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:09,140
You just have to be
the greatest banker?

148
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:11,642
It's my job. I want to do it well.

149
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:14,687
Congratulations. Me, too.
But at what cost?

150
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,523
Syd, I think you're acting
like a numps.

151
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,902
To you, my job might seem pointless
but it's far from pointless.

152
00:13:21,986 --> 00:13:23,737
I you knew what I dealt with,

153
00:13:23,821 --> 00:13:26,407
you might even thank me
for doing my job so well.

154
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:31,412
What the hell are you talking about?

155
00:13:32,872 --> 00:13:36,250
Nothing. I'm going to work.
I'll see you guys.

156
00:13:43,132 --> 00:13:45,801
Ineni Hassan is a wanted man.

157
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:48,304
He's been selling arms
to K-Directorate

158
00:13:48,387 --> 00:13:52,349
and is looking to partner up with
one of a number of rogue nations.

159
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:56,228
This is the last photograph of Hassan
taken a month ago in Madrid.

160
00:13:56,312 --> 00:14:00,357
We've put a lot of manpower into
finding him, but found nothing.

161
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:02,276
Last week, thanks to Bristow,

162
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:05,946
we seized a majority
of Mr Hassan's private assets.

163
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,159
We were hoping that would help us
to smoke him out. We think it has.

164
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:14,663
SIGINT picked up communications
originating from this private island.

165
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:16,749
- What's there?
- Private resort.

166
00:14:16,832 --> 00:14:18,501
More hideout than hideaway.

167
00:14:18,584 --> 00:14:22,296
It's a fugitive's paradise.
Extradition's notoriously lax.

168
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:26,425
It's heavily secured,
but anyone can buy entry for a price.

169
00:14:27,218 --> 00:14:30,262
- You think Hassan's there?
- No, it's not likely.

170
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:31,889
But it gives us a lead.

171
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:35,017
Severn Driscoll,
former resident of the UK,

172
00:14:35,101 --> 00:14:39,021
master forger, military advisor
and now self-employed.

173
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:42,483
Semba Island has been his home
over the last 12 years.

174
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:45,569
You think Driscoll made Hassan
new identity papers?

175
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:46,946
It's our best bet.

176
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:50,074
Go as Victoria King,
daughter of an industrialist.

177
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:52,618
Your assignment
is to locate Driscoll,

178
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:56,455
and ascertain the new identity
of Ineni Hassan.

179
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:06,298
Sydney, I heard
about what happened.

180
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:09,593
Are you alright?

181
00:15:10,469 --> 00:15:11,846
I'm fine.

182
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,223
Russek.

183
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:18,978
- That was a shock.
- You didn't...

184
00:15:19,061 --> 00:15:20,312
What?

185
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:25,151
Have anything to do with that?

186
00:15:25,234 --> 00:15:27,778
What, do you mean
did I engineer it somehow?

187
00:15:29,822 --> 00:15:31,240
No, of course not.

188
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:39,039
He was killed. Russek, last night.

189
00:15:44,962 --> 00:15:48,757
In Kenya, if you find Driscoll
and Hassan's new identity...

190
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:53,512
I'll keep it away from SD-6
and give it to you.

191
00:15:57,516 --> 00:15:59,560
- You hear that?
- What?

192
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:02,646
That pitch.
Definitely nine-millimetre.

193
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,400
That's a close-range hit.

194
00:16:08,486 --> 00:16:10,488
Twice in the chest,
once in the head.

195
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:13,741
Yeah.
It's how Eloise Kurtz was killed.

196
00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:16,535
Whoever sent me this tape
wants me to hear it.

197
00:16:16,619 --> 00:16:19,455
- Why would he want that?
- You don't know it's a he.

198
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,791
You hear that?

199
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:25,628
That delay before the last one?
That's the one in the head.

200
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:28,255
- Can we isolate that?
- I can improve on it.

201
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:30,216
This tape was made from that pin.

202
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:32,927
Whoever paid that girl
to say she was Kate Jones

203
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,055
is the same person who gave her
the pin and sent the tape.

204
00:16:36,138 --> 00:16:38,682
No. Someone else could
have given her the pin.

205
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:40,309
Or replaced the one she had.

206
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:43,312
Even then, this thing
was on a wireless transmitter.

207
00:16:43,395 --> 00:16:45,940
Someone else
could have made this tape.

208
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:47,733
We're getting somewhere.

209
00:16:47,817 --> 00:16:51,487
Why would someone send the fake
Kate Jones and want me to hear this?

210
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,823
- Wait.
- Did you tell him about SD-6?

211
00:16:53,906 --> 00:16:57,785
- What was that?
- Did you tell him about SD-6?

212
00:16:57,868 --> 00:16:59,829
- About SD-6?
- SD-6.

213
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:04,291
SD-6? Play that back.

214
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,460
Did you tell him about SD-6?

215
00:17:07,378 --> 00:17:09,338
What the hell's SD-6?

216
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:32,153
I'm sorry that I was snippy with you
about my job.

217
00:17:32,236 --> 00:17:34,572
You know, you're allowed to be.

218
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:37,116
No, I was a jerk.
I'm sorry I was a jerk.

219
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:40,828
You don't have to apologise to me.
I was just...

220
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:42,830
I just see you working so hard.

221
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:46,876
I know. That's why I'm here.
I was talking to Francie.

222
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:49,545
I need to do something
that's not job-related.

223
00:17:49,628 --> 00:17:51,338
So maybe the four of us

224
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:54,550
should go to Lake Arrowhead
for a few days next week.

225
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:57,136
- I've got a trip tonight.
- Of course you do.

226
00:17:57,219 --> 00:17:59,513
But I am off all next week.

227
00:17:59,597 --> 00:18:02,016
Yeah, I'm in.

228
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:09,440
- What?
- You're not here alone.

229
00:18:12,777 --> 00:18:14,195
Hi, Jenny.

230
00:18:14,278 --> 00:18:15,863
Do you wanna come in?

231
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:17,907
No, thanks, I'm gonna go.

232
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,493
- OK. Good to see you, though.
- You, too.

233
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:22,495
- Bye.
- Bye.

234
00:18:49,063 --> 00:18:50,356
May I help you?

235
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:53,526
I'm Victoria King.
You're expecting me.

236
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:57,446
Welcome to Semba Island.
Let me check on your suite.

237
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,575
This place you're going to
is swank. Super swank.

238
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:05,746
Which is why I made you
these puppies.

239
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,708
Not only do they take pictures
and have telephoto lenses, but...

240
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:12,545
...they're super swank.

241
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:45,578
I'm sorry.

242
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:47,496
Miss King, your suite is ready.

243
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,623
- Enjoy your stay.
- I'll try.

244
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:18,652
- I'm very sorry about the music.
- Excuse me?

245
00:20:18,736 --> 00:20:23,115
Sometimes when I drink too much,
I play my music too loudly.

246
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:26,160
Last night, I drank too much.

247
00:20:27,203 --> 00:20:29,914
I didn't hear any music last night.

248
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,125
That's impossible.

249
00:20:34,627 --> 00:20:36,921
You are the man from suite 47?

250
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:38,964
No. I wish I were.

251
00:20:40,257 --> 00:20:43,094
- Severn Driscoll.
- Victoria King.

252
00:20:44,095 --> 00:20:46,722
You look familiar.
Where are you staying?

253
00:20:46,806 --> 00:20:49,934
I'm a resident here. Suite 350.

254
00:20:51,435 --> 00:20:53,604
You have a standing invitation.

255
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:56,482
I'm so embarrassed.

256
00:20:56,565 --> 00:20:58,651
I like loud music.

257
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:02,279
I'll see you around.

258
00:21:06,951 --> 00:21:09,662
Mr Stoller? Hi.

259
00:21:09,745 --> 00:21:13,082
I'm Will Tippin. I left you
a message. How are you doing?

260
00:21:13,165 --> 00:21:16,544
I'm a reporter doing research
on something called SD-6.

261
00:21:16,627 --> 00:21:18,629
I did a search on it. One match.

262
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:20,965
A deposition from a case you tried.

263
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:22,883
The People versus David McNeil?

264
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:25,261
David McNeil's an old friend of mine.

265
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:28,264
Do you recall a reference to SD-6?

266
00:21:28,347 --> 00:21:31,934
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Discovery lasted years.

267
00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:35,729
Well, I'm really trying
to figure out what exactly SD-6 is.

268
00:21:35,813 --> 00:21:38,816
Do you think that
maybe Mr McNeil was a part of it?

269
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:41,861
McNeil is a regular guy,
a computer programmer.

270
00:21:41,944 --> 00:21:44,321
He started a business
people wanted to buy.

271
00:21:44,405 --> 00:21:46,782
One company
wouldn't take no for an answer.

272
00:21:46,866 --> 00:21:48,659
When David said no,

273
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:52,746
that same day, the Government
started an investigation.

274
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,792
He was charged with larceny
and sentenced to 16 years.

275
00:21:56,876 --> 00:22:00,421
If he was such an innocent,
why did he plea-bargain?

276
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:04,550
His wife killed herself.

277
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:08,679
His daughter, my goddaughter,
now lives with my wife and I.

278
00:22:08,763 --> 00:22:11,056
David wanted nothing
to happen to her.

279
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,018
You're saying you think
Mrs McNeil was murdered?

280
00:22:28,908 --> 00:22:32,787
Cellphone, right? Obviously
a cellphone, but observe.

281
00:22:33,913 --> 00:22:37,583
This unscrambles any standard
Jericho keycard system,

282
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,002
which is what they use
on Semba Island.

283
00:23:29,343 --> 00:23:31,554
Who the hell are you?

284
00:23:38,102 --> 00:23:39,562
Where the hell is Severn?

285
00:23:39,645 --> 00:23:42,231
He was supposed to meet me here
20 minutes ago.

286
00:23:42,314 --> 00:23:44,191
You are pointing a gun at me.

287
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:45,901
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

288
00:23:45,985 --> 00:23:47,862
Look at me, look closely.

289
00:23:47,945 --> 00:23:50,322
You don't know this face
or who I am?

290
00:23:50,406 --> 00:23:51,449
No.

291
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:30,070
I'm sorry.

292
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:40,247
I'm sorry you had to see that.

293
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:44,043
Ineni Hassan
doesn't just have a new name,

294
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:46,587
he has a new face
and is living in Havana.

295
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,715
He's now using the alias
Nebseni Saad.

296
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:52,968
And as you know,
he's broken an agreement with SD-6.

297
00:24:53,052 --> 00:24:57,890
He has stolen from us.
The whole community is watching.

298
00:24:57,973 --> 00:25:00,059
We need to set an example
with Hassan.

299
00:25:00,142 --> 00:25:02,353
Any intel
about where in Havana he is?

300
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:06,607
No, we don't know.
That's why I'm sending you to Cuba.

301
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:09,985
I need you to rendezvous
with the usual contacts.

302
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:12,780
Locate Hassan and take care of him.

303
00:25:16,575 --> 00:25:19,453
- Thank you.
- I heard about Russek.

304
00:25:19,537 --> 00:25:21,622
And now with Hassan...

305
00:25:23,415 --> 00:25:26,418
I understand
it's been a difficult week.

306
00:25:32,174 --> 00:25:36,554
One night...
Now, this is years ago.

307
00:25:36,637 --> 00:25:40,474
Maybe two years
before you and I met.

308
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,812
I'd just finished my first Far East
briefing at the White House.

309
00:25:44,895 --> 00:25:46,897
I was new to the CIA.

310
00:25:47,982 --> 00:25:52,319
After that meeting, everyone got into
a limousine to head back to Langley.

311
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:56,824
But I didn't. I told them
I was gonna walk for a while.

312
00:25:56,907 --> 00:26:00,661
They looked at me funny.
It was a cold night.

313
00:26:00,744 --> 00:26:03,205
So I said, "I need to get some air."

314
00:26:05,749 --> 00:26:07,835
But the truth is...

315
00:26:08,878 --> 00:26:10,963
...I was overcome.

316
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,343
It occurred to me as I was
walking down the White House steps

317
00:26:16,427 --> 00:26:18,846
that I was living
in a perfect moment.

318
00:26:20,973 --> 00:26:23,517
Everything was filled with promise.

319
00:26:24,685 --> 00:26:27,188
My role in the CIA,

320
00:26:27,813 --> 00:26:31,275
my relationship with the wife
that I had not yet met.

321
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,947
Still, I could feel
a darkness coming.

322
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:40,743
So I wandered around for a while.

323
00:26:40,826 --> 00:26:43,662
Ended up at the Jefferson Memorial.

324
00:26:43,746 --> 00:26:46,248
It was always my favourite one.

325
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:52,421
I looked out across the basin,
Lincoln right there.

326
00:26:52,505 --> 00:26:55,341
I didn't know
how it would finally materialise.

327
00:26:55,424 --> 00:26:56,967
The darkness.

328
00:26:58,094 --> 00:27:00,221
I had nothing to base it on.

329
00:27:00,304 --> 00:27:03,849
It wasn't as if
the CIA had just betrayed me,

330
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,187
or my wife had just been diagnosed
with lymphoma.

331
00:27:10,564 --> 00:27:12,525
None of that had happened yet.

332
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:17,404
So whenever life takes
an unfortunate turn,

333
00:27:17,488 --> 00:27:21,617
as it has this week,
I just remind myself...

334
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,455
...that I could see it coming
all along.

335
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:37,842
I want Hassan dead,
before the weekend.

336
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:42,346
Hassan's new identity
is Nebseni Saad.

337
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:44,849
And...

338
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:46,684
This is his passport number.

339
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:49,395
I got back to LA this morning
and met with Sloane.

340
00:27:49,478 --> 00:27:51,147
I told him Kenya was a failure,

341
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,774
that I didn't find out
Hassan's new identity.

342
00:27:53,858 --> 00:27:56,235
Sloane found out last night
that Hassan,

343
00:27:56,318 --> 00:27:59,405
or whatever his name is now,
is in Cuba.

344
00:28:01,115 --> 00:28:04,910
Sloane sent your father to Cuba
to kill Hassan.

345
00:28:06,495 --> 00:28:10,583
After your father met with Sloane,
he met with me.

346
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:15,254
I'm leaving for Cuba in 30 minutes.
What's the countermission?

347
00:28:15,337 --> 00:28:19,508
Sloane might want Hassan dead
but the CIA needs him alive.

348
00:28:19,592 --> 00:28:24,096
We need his client list.
It'll tell us what weapons he sold.

349
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,514
It's invaluable.

350
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:28,225
I don't need a lesson
in the arms trade.

351
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:32,646
Fine. Go to Cuba, use your contacts,
get to Hassan.

352
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,025
But instead of taking him out,
you'll tell him the truth.

353
00:28:36,108 --> 00:28:37,860
That SD-6 sent you to kill him.

354
00:28:37,943 --> 00:28:40,446
Convince him
that you're turning on SD-6.

355
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:44,867
Say you're willing to fake his death
in exchange for his client list.

356
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,536
- You're making a huge mistake.
- Am I?

357
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,246
Trusting a man like Hassan.

358
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,707
There will be a CIA team
at the location

359
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:53,834
where his death is to be faked.

360
00:28:53,918 --> 00:28:56,837
Hassan will never be a free man
again.

361
00:28:56,921 --> 00:28:58,923
That's all that happened?

362
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:03,385
That's it. Your father's
getting Hassan for the CIA.

363
00:29:06,764 --> 00:29:10,351
- What?
- Nothing.

364
00:29:10,434 --> 00:29:13,437
I gotta go, I've got friends coming.

365
00:29:13,521 --> 00:29:16,482
- Francie, right?
- Yeah, and Will.

366
00:29:16,565 --> 00:29:18,317
Will.

367
00:29:18,984 --> 00:29:20,569
- I'll see you.
- OK.

368
00:29:28,786 --> 00:29:31,330
Hassan will never be a free man
again.

369
00:29:31,413 --> 00:29:33,833
I'll make contact by 6pm tomorrow.

370
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:38,712
I got a copy
of Russek's transmission.

371
00:29:38,796 --> 00:29:41,132
The one SD-6 intercepted.

372
00:29:44,552 --> 00:29:48,347
I also went through the CIA logs
and compared the two.

373
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:51,600
They don't match.
You fixed the transmission.

374
00:29:51,684 --> 00:29:55,271
Made it look like Russek by altering
the signal's point of origin

375
00:29:55,354 --> 00:29:57,690
and changed the message content.

376
00:29:58,607 --> 00:30:01,735
Who in the hell
do you think you are,

377
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:04,280
checking up on me, pulling my file,

378
00:30:04,363 --> 00:30:06,282
second-guessing my choices?

379
00:30:06,365 --> 00:30:09,827
Let's just both face the facts.
You're not that person.

380
00:30:10,828 --> 00:30:13,706
Neither your experience
nor your intelligence

381
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:16,834
has earned you the right
to question a thing that I do.

382
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:19,253
So, I'm gonna make two suggestions.

383
00:30:19,336 --> 00:30:21,338
One, that you stop it,

384
00:30:21,422 --> 00:30:25,050
and two, that the next time
they assign you to be my handler,

385
00:30:25,134 --> 00:30:26,802
you kindly decline.

386
00:30:29,013 --> 00:30:31,849
- Russek never transmitted.
- Of course he didn't.

387
00:30:31,932 --> 00:30:34,727
If you got the SD-6 transmission,
why ask me?

388
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:39,565
I never got the SD-6 transmission.
It was just a hunch.

389
00:30:43,611 --> 00:30:48,783
I'd just learned that my daughter was
about to be tortured, Mr Vaughn.

390
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:50,993
Most likely executed.

391
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:53,162
I had no time to go for help.

392
00:31:12,056 --> 00:31:13,891
Some monitors went out.

393
00:31:13,974 --> 00:31:17,561
I want you
to check every connection. Now.

394
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:30,574
I knew that altering the transmission
was a dangerous gamble.

395
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:34,078
They could have detected a
disruption but it was all I could do.

396
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,674
And now you can judge
what I've done.

397
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,138
I don't give a damn what you do.

398
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:02,857
Syd?

399
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:08,279
Thank you. Still got the shoes on?

400
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:10,781
Have you ever even worn
snowshoes before?

401
00:32:10,865 --> 00:32:13,784
Get with the programme.
There's an art form to this.

402
00:32:13,868 --> 00:32:15,870
- What's that?
- Nothing.

403
00:32:15,953 --> 00:32:18,664
- Some guy from work gave that to me.
- Not Dixon?

404
00:32:18,747 --> 00:32:21,292
No, he's still recovering.
Some other guy.

405
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:23,377
- Do I know him?
- No, he's no one.

406
00:32:23,461 --> 00:32:25,796
Really? Just some guy?

407
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,466
That's nice.
It's nice that he'd give you that.

408
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:30,634
I know. It was weird.

409
00:32:30,718 --> 00:32:33,220
- Why, how come?
- I don't know.

410
00:32:33,304 --> 00:32:34,930
- Maybe he likes you.
- No.

411
00:32:35,014 --> 00:32:36,515
- Maybe he does.
- No.

412
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:41,061
Not the way Jenny likes you.
She looked nice in your shirt.

413
00:32:41,145 --> 00:32:43,105
- It's a nice shirt.
- Nice and snug.

414
00:32:43,189 --> 00:32:46,025
- Easy with the cheap shots.
- It was flattering.

415
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:47,985
Whatever. I was just saying...

416
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:50,738
- Will?
- OK.

417
00:32:50,821 --> 00:32:52,740
The Iron Chef needs me.

418
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,830
This guy gave her
a Christmas present.

419
00:32:59,914 --> 00:33:02,458
Some guy from the office.
Some guy.

420
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:05,795
- So?
- You didn't know about it?

421
00:33:05,878 --> 00:33:08,005
Know what? What's to know?

422
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:10,132
I did hear about you, though.

423
00:33:11,008 --> 00:33:14,595
- About what?
- You and the little cheerleader.

424
00:33:14,678 --> 00:33:17,431
First of all,
she's not a cheerleader any more,

425
00:33:17,515 --> 00:33:19,892
Secondly, it doesn't mean anything.

426
00:34:17,032 --> 00:34:20,536
I found this old picture of me
and my father. I was staring at it.

427
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:24,415
For some reason, I remembered
asking him about Santa Claus.

428
00:34:24,498 --> 00:34:26,208
- Santa Claus?
- Yeah.

429
00:34:26,292 --> 00:34:28,586
If he was real.
If Santa Claus was real.

430
00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:34,091
My father would answer me
in this flat, factual way.

431
00:34:34,216 --> 00:34:36,510
"Yes, of course he's real,"
every time.

432
00:34:36,594 --> 00:34:38,971
The thing is I knew
that he was lying.

433
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:41,098
That's why I'd ask him again.

434
00:34:41,182 --> 00:34:44,393
When I questioned him about Russek,
he was the same way.

435
00:34:44,477 --> 00:34:45,978
I wanted to believe him,

436
00:34:46,061 --> 00:34:49,899
but looking at that stupid picture,
I realised.

437
00:34:49,982 --> 00:34:53,110
Russek wasn't K-Directorate,
he wasn't the guilty one.

438
00:34:53,194 --> 00:34:54,695
- I was.
- Sydney.

439
00:34:54,779 --> 00:34:56,655
Russek did nothing wrong.

440
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,949
Because of my father,
he was killed.

441
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:02,787
Russek wasn't such an innocent.
You wanna know about Russek?

442
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:06,415
He was an early member of SD-6.
He knew they were the bad guys.

443
00:35:06,499 --> 00:35:09,126
He was the leader
of at least a dozen operations

444
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,587
that stole weapons,
chemicals and intel

445
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:14,799
and sold them to enemies
of the United States for cash

446
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:17,468
to fund more SD-6 operations.

447
00:35:17,551 --> 00:35:20,012
Just like the one
that killed your fiancé.

448
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,724
He got what he deserved.

449
00:35:24,183 --> 00:35:26,727
If you know so much about Russek,

450
00:35:26,811 --> 00:35:29,688
then you know
he wasn't with K-Directorate.

451
00:35:31,273 --> 00:35:33,359
It seems he was sacrificed, yes.

452
00:35:33,442 --> 00:35:36,028
See, that's not a choice
my dad can make.

453
00:35:36,112 --> 00:35:38,280
What would you have done

454
00:35:38,364 --> 00:35:43,119
had it been your daughter
or your son? Or Danny?

455
00:36:05,141 --> 00:36:07,226
Listen, I've something else.

456
00:36:09,186 --> 00:36:12,523
In Cuba, your father made contact
with an old informant,

457
00:36:12,606 --> 00:36:14,900
a Havana insider,
who set up the meeting

458
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:17,820
between your father
and one of Hassan's men.

459
00:36:18,404 --> 00:36:20,406
What happened?

460
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:47,725
Sydney, Hassan has your father.

461
00:36:49,268 --> 00:36:53,022
- What's being done?
- We have a team in place in Havana.

462
00:36:53,105 --> 00:36:55,775
But Devlin doesn't wanna move yet.

463
00:36:55,858 --> 00:36:58,694
He says sending a team
to scour the countryside

464
00:36:58,778 --> 00:37:01,864
will only attract attention
we can't afford.

465
00:37:04,909 --> 00:37:08,454
You said you understand
what my father did for me.

466
00:37:08,537 --> 00:37:11,373
That he couldn't just wait
and do nothing.

467
00:37:12,374 --> 00:37:16,337
Then you'll understand
that I'm going to need your help

468
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,047
to get to Cuba.

469
00:37:43,697 --> 00:37:45,616
Hi. I'm Will Tippin.

470
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:48,327
- David McNeil.
- Thank you for meeting with me.

471
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,703
Do you mind if I...?

472
00:37:49,787 --> 00:37:51,622
- No, that's alright.
- Great.

473
00:37:51,705 --> 00:37:54,625
In the letter you sent,
you weren't real specific.

474
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:57,336
You're doing an article
on encryption software?

475
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,505
Yeah.

476
00:38:01,257 --> 00:38:02,925
No, not really.

477
00:38:03,968 --> 00:38:06,053
I mean, it's an interesting topic.

478
00:38:06,137 --> 00:38:08,931
It's timely,
and you know, we can do that.

479
00:38:09,014 --> 00:38:12,977
- So, why are we sitting here?
- I'm researching something.

480
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,520
It's called SD-6.

481
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:20,151
I don't have anything to say
about that.

482
00:38:20,234 --> 00:38:23,946
Why? Why don't you tell me
what you know?

483
00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:26,949
- I don't know anything.
- Tell me what you suspect.

484
00:38:27,032 --> 00:38:28,784
I don't suspect anything.

485
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,124
I met with Robert Stoller.

486
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:41,005
- He told me about your wife.
- Listen to me.

487
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:44,800
You stay away from him.
You understand?

488
00:38:44,884 --> 00:38:46,385
Don't talk to him again.

489
00:39:21,879 --> 00:39:25,674
My men, they told me
that you have contacted them. How?

490
00:39:25,758 --> 00:39:28,844
I knew who to ask
and who to ask for.

491
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,556
Nebseni Saad. That's your new name.

492
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,683
I know it, SD-6 knows it.

493
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:39,313
- SD-6? Your employer?
- Yes.

494
00:39:42,108 --> 00:39:46,195
They will learn what happens
when they send someone after me.

495
00:39:47,321 --> 00:39:51,367
Wait. I have an offer to make.
That's why I'm here.

496
00:40:02,545 --> 00:40:04,463
You think SD-6 ripped you off,

497
00:40:04,547 --> 00:40:07,091
so you stole from them
and you disappeared.

498
00:40:07,174 --> 00:40:10,261
Now they've stolen your money
and they want you dead.

499
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:13,347
SD-6 will never kill me.

500
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:17,143
You're too smart to believe that.

501
00:40:17,226 --> 00:40:20,604
Think about Isaac Lohan
or Uli Schröder.

502
00:40:20,688 --> 00:40:22,565
They will find you.

503
00:40:22,648 --> 00:40:25,401
They have a photograph of you
from Semba Island.

504
00:40:26,735 --> 00:40:27,945
How?

505
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:31,407
That's the question you'll ask
before they kill you.

506
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:35,327
- What's your offer?
- You have something of value to me.

507
00:40:35,411 --> 00:40:37,288
Your client list.

508
00:40:37,955 --> 00:40:41,625
I want it. Not for SD-6, but for me.

509
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:43,961
For my own personal use.

510
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:53,262
You give me your client list
and I'll give you your freedom.

511
00:40:54,764 --> 00:40:55,806
How?

512
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,476
We'll fake your death,
you and I together.

513
00:40:59,101 --> 00:41:01,937
I'll return to SD-6,
show them the photographs,

514
00:41:02,021 --> 00:41:04,690
they'll think
you're no longer a problem.

515
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:07,818
You'll be free.

516
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:36,680
How do I know
that you're not setting me up?

517
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:38,849
How do I know
that if I give you my list

518
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:41,352
that I've worked decades to assemble,

519
00:41:41,435 --> 00:41:44,480
that you're not simply
going to shoot me anyway?

520
00:41:44,563 --> 00:41:46,982
Because you can trust me.

521
00:41:47,066 --> 00:41:50,361
Think about it.
I'm the one who contacted your men.

522
00:41:50,444 --> 00:41:51,862
If I was here to kill you,

523
00:41:51,946 --> 00:41:54,365
all I had to do was wait,
keep my mouth shut.

524
00:41:55,991 --> 00:41:59,036
You didn't know you'd been ID'd
with your new face.

525
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,914
I could've popped you
in the head like a deer.

526
00:42:02,915 --> 00:42:06,168
If you say yes to this,
we both win. Big.

527
00:42:06,252 --> 00:42:10,589
If you say no, we both die.
It's your call.

528
00:42:23,853 --> 00:42:26,021
- Interesting.
- What?

529
00:42:26,647 --> 00:42:29,316
Well, I think you make a good offer.

530
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:32,945
But I still don't know
if I can trust you.

531
00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:37,616
So prove to me that you
are willing to go against SD-6.

532
00:42:38,284 --> 00:42:41,162
- Anything.
- You say you came alone?

533
00:42:41,245 --> 00:42:44,290
- Yes.
- There's someone else here.

534
00:42:52,381 --> 00:42:54,550
Someone who works for SD-6.

535
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,822
Here. Kill her.

536
00:43:20,326 --> 00:43:23,704
Aim the gun at this woman
if you are who you say you are

537
00:43:23,788 --> 00:43:25,164
and kill her.
