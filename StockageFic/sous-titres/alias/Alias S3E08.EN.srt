1
00:00:01,092 --> 00:00:02,290
<i>Previously on "Alias."</i>

2
00:00:02,385 --> 00:00:04,259
Oh, my God.

3
00:00:04,345 --> 00:00:06,255
I recently learned
that Sydney Bristow

4
00:00:06,347 --> 00:00:09,052
murdered a father
I never had a chance to know.

5
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:12,309
I'm confident that you'll
relay this information

6
00:00:12,395 --> 00:00:14,554
to the appropriate parties.

7
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:19,562
I have a plane waiting
at the Dover Airfield.

8
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:22,689
It'll take you anywhere, but
tell me where you want to go.

9
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:24,061
Rome.

10
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,781
I'm going to Rome.

11
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:30,196
And even though everything's
changed, some things don't.

12
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:33,408
I'm not gonna lose you twice.

13
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:47,233
23-10 requesting landing.

14
00:02:07,302 --> 00:02:09,294
Confirm that.

15
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,348
You find anything,
you let me know.

16
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:46,770
Lauren!

17
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,018
I'll call you back.

18
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:50,654
- Dixon spoken with the D.C.I.?
- Yes.

19
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,360
Good. Now, make sure we have
access to all computer accounts,

20
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,323
e-mails, memos,
and correspondence

21
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,153
seen in this office
in the last two years.

22
00:03:57,245 --> 00:03:58,656
I put a request in
through Langley.

23
00:03:58,747 --> 00:04:01,664
- Who'd you talk to over there?
- Brandon. I'm on it.

24
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,160
I understand the director
of Central Intelligence

25
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:06,375
has already conveyed his desire
to transfer authority

26
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:09,250
over this task force
from your agency to mine.

27
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,547
I expect you to cooperate fully.

28
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:12,464
No.

29
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,927
Not exactly.

30
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:16,764
I explained to my superiors
the decision was mine

31
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:18,639
to withhold information
from the NSC

32
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,516
regarding
Sydney Bristow's involvement

33
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:21,681
in the Lazarey murder.

34
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,806
And that the members
of my staff in question

35
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,305
were acting under
direct orders from me.

36
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,515
I see.

37
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,061
My staff will remain
on active duty and cooperate...

38
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:34,860
They're not your staff,
Mr. Dixon, not anymore.

39
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:37,737
I'm pulling your clearance
until further notice.

40
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:39,654
Mr. Lindsey, I would expect
nothing less from you.

41
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,367
One of my men will escort you
to a facility for questioning.

42
00:04:42,457 --> 00:04:47,035
In the meantime, surrender all
credentials and access cards.

43
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,301
Well, of course, you'll be
questioned as well.

44
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:01,798
Let's not make this
any harder than it has to be.

45
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:04,680
It's too late for that.

46
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,688
I need to talk to you
right now.

47
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:11,934
Before you start, know that
I did what I thought was right.

48
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:14,270
Sydney is in Lindsey's
custody because of you.

49
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:16,072
The Lazarey murder
was my assignment.

50
00:05:16,157 --> 00:05:18,066
Sydney murdered
a Russian diplomat!

51
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:20,282
Don't act like this is
your first day on the job.

52
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,287
- Sydney is in NSC custody.
- She is in Lindsey's custody.

53
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:24,997
Do you think
Lindsey's unaccountable?

54
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,538
His operation
is funded by black money.

55
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,370
What the White House
expects from him is results.

56
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:33,246
What you're suggesting is that
I participate in a cover-up.

57
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:35,250
No, but I hoped
you'd be a person about this.

58
00:05:35,343 --> 00:05:38,677
While you clearly underestimate
not only my ability

59
00:05:38,763 --> 00:05:41,337
to do my job,
but also my humanity,

60
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:43,390
you should know that not only do
I believe I did the right thing,

61
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:47,556
but the more you talk,
the more suspicious I get.

62
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,601
You're the one who got her
out of the country, aren't you?

63
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:54,230
Do you know
what would happen to you

64
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,191
if it becomes known you helped
a fugitive evade the government?

65
00:05:57,282 --> 00:06:00,864
I'm not concerned
about myself right now.

66
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,581
If what you're suggesting
is right,

67
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,122
that to learn what happened
to Sydney the past two years,

68
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,832
Robert Lindsey intends on
having surgery performed on her

69
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:13,416
which will render her
brain-dead,

70
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,997
why would he have me
write the White House brief?

71
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:16,708
What?

72
00:06:16,801 --> 00:06:18,628
He's asked me to go with him

73
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,293
as an observer
of Sydney's interrogation.

74
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:24,474
Clearly, he has nothing to hide.

75
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:32,472
Michael, for whatever reason,
you're overreacting to this.

76
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:39,239
I don't know how long I'll be
gone, so I guess I'll see you.

77
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,981
Jack, I want to be
a part of it.

78
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,391
If I knew what you were talking
about, I'd refuse.

79
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:17,276
I've thought of a half-dozen
scenarios to help Sydney.

80
00:07:17,362 --> 00:07:18,311
Lindsey has to be shut down.

81
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,196
Did your scenarios
take into account

82
00:07:20,281 --> 00:07:21,859
the fact that helping Sydney
at this point

83
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,619
will require breaking at least
a dozen federal laws?

84
00:07:24,702 --> 00:07:27,538
Just you telling me this means
you have something planned.

85
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:29,579
Damn it, let me help.

86
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:33,461
If something happens
to Sydney...

87
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:38,207
Meet me in the parking garage
in three minutes.

88
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,395
What you doin'?

89
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:05,945
You looking for something?

90
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,912
Maybe.

91
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:21,209
Hey, if you find any,
I'll have some.

92
00:08:23,595 --> 00:08:26,430
If it's candy.

93
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:31,260
God, I love candy.

94
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,727
I'm Campbell.

95
00:08:35,857 --> 00:08:37,600
Sydney.

96
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,102
Sydney.

97
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:43,816
Hi.

98
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:51,996
Hey, hey, don't leave, okay?

99
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:54,370
Please.

100
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,005
Been a long time
without someone to talk to.

101
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,084
So, this contact we're meeting,
former NSC?

102
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,591
No.

103
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:12,137
How are they going
to help us locate Sydney?

104
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:15,771
We're waiting for Sloane.

105
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,062
You called Sloane on this?

106
00:09:21,403 --> 00:09:23,312
You and I will be prime suspects
behind any attempt

107
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:25,563
to free Sydney from NSC custody.

108
00:09:25,657 --> 00:09:27,365
Sloane has agreed
to help us make it seem

109
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,110
as if it were the work
of The Covenant.

110
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,827
Do I trust him on this?

111
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:33,237
Not necessarily.

112
00:09:40,672 --> 00:09:43,377
Gentlemen,
according to my sources,

113
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:45,625
Sydney is being held
at Camp Williams.

114
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,378
Camp Williams is a naval
training facility.

115
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,929
Why would Lindsey
take her there?

116
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:51,136
It's home to an unacknowledged
NSC detention centre

117
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,430
used for the interrogation
of suspected terrorists

118
00:09:53,518 --> 00:09:55,226
whose captivity
the government won't admit to.

119
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:58,431
So to help her, we'll need
a tactical team, at least 8 men.

120
00:09:58,523 --> 00:10:00,895
Transportation, weapons,
specialised backup.

121
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:03,391
- I would suggest Brill.
- I thought he was in Freetown.

122
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:05,194
Not since the government fell.

123
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,153
If he's available,
Dormier would know.

124
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,031
We'll need blueprints
to Camp Williams.

125
00:10:09,117 --> 00:10:10,944
The FEMA central office
downtown.

126
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:12,909
They should have blueprints
on file.

127
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:16,531
Good. We'll prep infiltration
into the FEMA building.

128
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:18,534
Meet back here in three hours.

129
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:20,999
I told you, Jack.

130
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,294
We'd work together again.

131
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:53,534
23-10 requesting landing.

132
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,368
Just so we're clear, it's in all
our best interests to make sure

133
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,327
that no one on the Hill
questions our ethics, Lauren.

134
00:11:00,418 --> 00:11:03,040
That's why I'm counting on you
to write a report

135
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,501
chronicling
our investigation to date

136
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,924
and our fair treatment
of Sydney Bristow.

137
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,967
Understood?

138
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,103
No! Hey!

139
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:23,558
Get her arm!

140
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,808
Get her down!
Tie it. Tie it!

141
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:32,318
But Sydney's made it clear
she doesn't remember anything.

142
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:35,363
But when we searched her flat in
Rome, we found a coded message

143
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:36,698
taped under her desk.

144
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:38,697
Now, if she can decode
that message,

145
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,450
it may help us infiltrate

146
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:43,708
or possibly even take down
The Covenant.

147
00:11:44,254 --> 00:11:46,377
What if she doesn't
recognise the code?

148
00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:49,465
As long as she demonstrates
a willingness to cooperate,

149
00:11:49,551 --> 00:11:52,338
that surgery will be
nothing more than a threat.

150
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:04,521
Miss Bristow, we know you know
how to read this code.

151
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:08,606
Do you recognise
your handwriting?

152
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,522
No.

153
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:15,441
I draw little hearts
over my I's.

154
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:18,156
Smiley faces sometimes.

155
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:22,868
What you're feeling now,
the pain from shock therapy,

156
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,453
it's nothing.

157
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:27,545
There's another procedure,
neurostimulation.

158
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,628
We can use it to find out where
you've been the last two years.

159
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:36,138
Decipher the text,
and we won't have to.

160
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,556
Don't bother negotiating
with me!

161
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:45,681
You better make sure I'm
a vegetable when you're done.

162
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:52,567
Try a higher setting.

163
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:05,793
The human body
is an amazing machine.

164
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:10,121
A couple of hours,
you'll almost feel human again.

165
00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:16,554
You have a strong heart, though.

166
00:13:16,638 --> 00:13:20,718
You could survive another
five, six sessions.

167
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:25,894
That would be a new record
for both of us.

168
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,816
I thought I was
supposed to be observing.

169
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:37,575
And you will,
as much as possible.

170
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:39,236
But my interrogation
of Agent Bristow

171
00:13:39,327 --> 00:13:41,783
includes a discussion
of classified material.

172
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:45,038
How could I report on an
investigation I'm not part of?

173
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,500
We can talk about it.
Come on.

174
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:49,751
- I'll brief you on what I can.
- No, I'm sorry.

175
00:13:49,838 --> 00:13:51,914
If I'm going to chronicle
our treatment of Sydney Bristow,

176
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:54,414
I need to see
how she's being treated.

177
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,630
How do you suppose
Sydney Bristow knew

178
00:13:59,723 --> 00:14:01,964
to flee the country
before she was aware

179
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:05,178
the NSC wanted
to take her into custody?

180
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:10,388
With plane tickets?
Fake passport?

181
00:14:11,276 --> 00:14:13,067
I doubt you want me
looking into who it was

182
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:16,818
that aided and abetted the
escape of a wanted fugitive.

183
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:23,829
That's why you asked for me.

184
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:26,404
Legally, you needed a witness.

185
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,326
Get to your office.

186
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:30,707
You have a report to write.

187
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,393
Sydney.

188
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,397
They didn't give you one.

189
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:00,818
It's cold at night.

190
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:02,367
Thank you.

191
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:12,414
This is not the best place.

192
00:15:18,927 --> 00:15:22,841
They wanted to know about Iran.

193
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,472
When I was there.
Assigned.

194
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:33,481
What do they want to know
about you?

195
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:42,948
Don't give it to them.

196
00:16:12,647 --> 00:16:14,936
That's checkmate in three moves.

197
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:16,602
You want to give me
my 50 bucks now,

198
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:18,650
or do we go
through the motions?

199
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:20,017
I got all day.

200
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:27,363
That's not tuition money, is it?

201
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:36,206
I'll put you in checkmate
in 10 moves.

202
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:41,751
Yeah, if I play
with my eyes closed.

203
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,675
Long time.

204
00:16:44,763 --> 00:16:46,755
Chile, '73.

205
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:49,421
Should have never helped
overthrow Allende.

206
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:52,304
Thomas Brill, Michael Vaughn.

207
00:16:53,021 --> 00:16:55,938
You Bill Vaughn's kid?

208
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:57,893
Yeah, he was my father.

209
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,147
No kidding.

210
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:01,027
He was a good man.

211
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:03,529
Thank you.

212
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,898
Any interest
in a high-risk extraction?

213
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,867
Always.
Paint me a picture.

214
00:17:08,953 --> 00:17:11,824
Camp Williams.
It's a detention centre.

215
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:14,073
- Blind?
- Blueprints.

216
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,076
Sloane's designing the op.

217
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:19,668
Man, look who's putting
the band back together.

218
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:22,458
Rules of engagement?

219
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,958
The facility's protected
by two dozen D.O.D. personnel.

220
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:26,962
Lethal force is not an option.

221
00:17:27,055 --> 00:17:30,009
If we're gonna use tranqs,
I'm gonna need 5 freelancers.

222
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,347
It's not gonna be cheap, Jack.
$250K per hire.

223
00:17:34,437 --> 00:17:36,430
Another 9 for the chopper.

224
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:40,852
And for the nonlethal
gunmetal add another 6.

225
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:42,272
Done.

226
00:17:43,488 --> 00:17:46,572
Meet me at this address
in two hours.

227
00:17:49,077 --> 00:17:51,069
Checkmate.

228
00:17:53,915 --> 00:17:56,371
You just agreed to pay him
$2 million.

229
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:57,918
3.

230
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,051
What the hell is this?

231
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:09,176
Storage.

232
00:18:21,443 --> 00:18:23,103
The fact that you're
letting me see this place

233
00:18:23,194 --> 00:18:25,602
means it's not
your only one, is it?

234
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:28,563
You're smarter than you look.

235
00:18:45,383 --> 00:18:47,542
Miss Bristow.

236
00:18:48,386 --> 00:18:49,715
You look better.

237
00:18:49,804 --> 00:18:51,797
Yeah, I feel great.
Thanks.

238
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,463
I hear you're making friends
with your cellmate.

239
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,264
He was a journalist, you know,
in the Middle East.

240
00:18:57,353 --> 00:19:00,141
Story is he died
in a car accident.

241
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:02,853
Truth is he was
protecting his source.

242
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,694
He thought the first amendment
would protect him.

243
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:08,483
He was strong, though, like you.

244
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:32,471
Code red.
Prisoner loose in corridor R33.

245
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:34,050
Initiate lockdown procedure.

246
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,382
Copy that.
I'm on it.

247
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:48,486
Hold her!

248
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:16,255
I found the junction box
and planted the video scrambler.

249
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:19,050
When you activate this, it will
lock down the security system

250
00:20:19,144 --> 00:20:21,350
for as long as it takes
to copy the blueprints.

251
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:22,386
Any word from Brill?

252
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,473
He should have the team hired
and equipped tonight,

253
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:27,317
as long as we're successful
and get the blueprints.

254
00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:28,647
Here we go.

255
00:20:28,737 --> 00:20:31,488
Okay, I got us
into the trunk exchange.

256
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:33,731
Now every incoming and outgoing
call to the FEMA building

257
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:36,150
will be rerouted
through this number.

258
00:20:36,244 --> 00:20:38,320
Get ready.

259
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:45,998
Sir, we lost picture.

260
00:20:49,924 --> 00:20:51,383
Weller Security.
Can you hold?

261
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:53,377
No, I can't.
This is the L.A. EOC.

262
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,632
All my screens went blank.

263
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:57,010
- Did you reboot?
- We're doing it now.

264
00:20:57,098 --> 00:20:59,768
I've got a man in the area.
I'll send him over.

265
00:21:04,522 --> 00:21:07,192
Yeah, I got a call.
You guys down?

266
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:08,935
- Where's Stuart?
- Sick.

267
00:21:09,027 --> 00:21:12,526
Got a nasal infection.
Freakin' nightmare.

268
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,359
I've been doing this
longer than you.

269
00:21:17,452 --> 00:21:19,575
Jack could have taken
a camera in there.

270
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:23,411
If they sweep him and find
a camera, this is over.

271
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:27,246
Federal security requires
we make a thorough search.

272
00:21:27,337 --> 00:21:28,914
I'm new, but I'm not new,
alright?

273
00:21:29,005 --> 00:21:30,084
I know the protocol.

274
00:21:30,173 --> 00:21:32,000
Then you know I got to stay
with you at all times.

275
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:35,258
Right. Give me the tools.
Show me the way.

276
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:46,145
Right over here.

277
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,565
This shouldn't take long.

278
00:21:53,655 --> 00:21:56,905
In the meantime, make sure
your data files are backed up.

279
00:21:56,991 --> 00:21:57,940
I already did.

280
00:21:58,034 --> 00:21:59,861
Right.

281
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:06,491
Having spent
a significant amount of time

282
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:08,292
with your wife
over the last year,

283
00:22:08,378 --> 00:22:12,210
I think it's safe to say
that you're a lucky man.

284
00:22:13,425 --> 00:22:15,382
Yes, I am.

285
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:18,261
I imagine that all of this

286
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:22,047
is something of a strain
on your relationship, hmm?

287
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:26,134
Terminal 12 will take us up.

288
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:39,363
Make the call.

289
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:43,364
- Federal Emergency Management.
- This is Director Blackman.

290
00:22:43,455 --> 00:22:45,032
I've been pulled from a meeting

291
00:22:45,123 --> 00:22:47,495
with the Secretary of Defence
to find out that your branch

292
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:49,292
has been dark
for the past 30 minutes.

293
00:22:49,377 --> 00:22:50,706
Yes, we're working on it.

294
00:22:50,795 --> 00:22:52,539
My supervisor's in
with the technician.

295
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,710
Whoa, son, son.

296
00:22:53,798 --> 00:22:55,542
Now, I'm sure you're aware
that the chances

297
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:59,465
of a terrorist attack
on Los Angeles are high,

298
00:22:59,554 --> 00:23:02,223
and if, God forbid, something
like that should befall us,

299
00:23:02,307 --> 00:23:04,465
I would expect
the central office tasked

300
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,513
with the management of such
an emergency would be prepared.

301
00:23:07,604 --> 00:23:11,767
So why don't you get your
supervisor on the line now?

302
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:14,648
Sir, Director Blackman's
on blue.

303
00:23:14,736 --> 00:23:16,147
You need to speak with him now.

304
00:23:16,237 --> 00:23:18,728
On my way.
Wait here.

305
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:52,348
There he is.

306
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,940
Go check on the alarm guy.

307
00:23:55,026 --> 00:23:56,935
Yes, sir.

308
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:00,153
Director Blackman.

309
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,410
As I'm sure you're aware,

310
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:15,415
the people of Los Angeles face
a myriad of potential disaster.

311
00:24:20,468 --> 00:24:22,295
We're not just talking
about terrorism.

312
00:24:22,387 --> 00:24:24,545
In case you haven't noticed,
we're due for an earthquake.

313
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:26,217
Plus, because of the recent
forest fire,

314
00:24:26,307 --> 00:24:27,552
we're susceptible to mudslide,

315
00:24:27,642 --> 00:24:30,429
not to mention the fact
there seems to be a riot

316
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,185
every time the Lakers win.

317
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:38,480
Just make sure you get it done.

318
00:24:41,072 --> 00:24:42,864
That'll do it.

319
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:46,360
You should be back online.

320
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:47,828
Great.

321
00:24:53,126 --> 00:24:55,664
- Take it easy.
- Get Blackman.

322
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:58,505
He'll want to know
we're back online right away.

323
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,250
Director Blackman, please.

324
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:03,759
Out of the country?

325
00:25:03,845 --> 00:25:06,597
I just spoke with him.
He said he was in Washington.

326
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:08,092
Hey!

327
00:25:11,603 --> 00:25:14,058
Stop where you are!

328
00:25:14,147 --> 00:25:16,472
- Stop where you are!
- Hands in the air!

329
00:25:32,332 --> 00:25:34,823
Get him down on the table.

330
00:25:34,918 --> 00:25:36,542
Easy.

331
00:25:42,384 --> 00:25:45,503
Get some 4x4s.

332
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:51,340
Just breathe.
Just breathe.

333
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:55,221
Okay, keep pressure
applied to the wound.

334
00:25:58,942 --> 00:26:01,018
- What is that?
- Morphine.

335
00:26:01,111 --> 00:26:03,732
No morphine.
I'll go into anaphylactic shock.

336
00:26:03,822 --> 00:26:05,731
Arvin, we have to dig
the bullet out.

337
00:26:05,824 --> 00:26:07,104
If you give me morphine,

338
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,952
I'll be dead
before you get to the bullet.

339
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:12,444
And don't get any ideas.

340
00:26:14,624 --> 00:26:17,329
I have to do this
to keep you from thrashing.

341
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:21,915
- Okay.
- Give him your belt to bite on.

342
00:26:22,006 --> 00:26:24,165
- Oh, I don't need a belt.
- Just do it.

343
00:26:25,552 --> 00:26:27,260
I need some light.

344
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:41,145
He passed out.

345
00:26:41,234 --> 00:26:42,514
Good.

346
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,402
Almost.

347
00:27:04,632 --> 00:27:06,625
Morning.

348
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:08,962
Hi.

349
00:27:13,641 --> 00:27:16,429
Think about the ocean.

350
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:21,184
When I don't feel good,
that's what I do.

351
00:27:23,485 --> 00:27:26,651
My son liked boats.

352
00:27:28,281 --> 00:27:30,108
He...

353
00:27:33,244 --> 00:27:35,071
was...

354
00:27:35,163 --> 00:27:36,906
6.

355
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,166
Maybe...

356
00:27:43,254 --> 00:27:45,543
he's still 6.

357
00:27:49,511 --> 00:27:54,173
I think he's older...now.

358
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:03,939
What is your son's name?

359
00:28:05,235 --> 00:28:08,070
His name was Benjamin.

360
00:28:13,118 --> 00:28:14,944
Benjamin.

361
00:28:23,044 --> 00:28:25,915
I can't believe I'm gonna ask,
but is he gonna be alright?

362
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:28,496
He'll recover.

363
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:32,838
The bullet nearly pierced
his axillary artery.

364
00:28:33,471 --> 00:28:35,713
I didn't know you wore glasses.

365
00:28:35,807 --> 00:28:37,634
Only during surgery.

366
00:28:39,894 --> 00:28:42,350
I'm gonna download the
blueprints from the camera,

367
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:45,108
but we're gonna need security
codes to get into Camp Williams.

368
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:46,769
Try Marshall.

369
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,983
He should be able to log on
to the NSC archive

370
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,648
from his station at the Rotunda.

371
00:28:50,739 --> 00:28:53,905
That's gonna be tricky with
NSC agents crawling everywhere.

372
00:28:53,992 --> 00:28:56,946
Yes. If only Marshall had
a well-trained CIA operative

373
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:58,614
to assist him.

374
00:29:00,498 --> 00:29:03,203
You're starting
to like me again.

375
00:29:04,711 --> 00:29:09,836
Vaughn,
with or without those codes,

376
00:29:09,924 --> 00:29:13,128
we'll be infiltrating
Camp Williams in five hours.

377
00:29:13,928 --> 00:29:15,802
Transfer team to cellblock 8.

378
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:18,380
Transfer team to cellblock 8.

379
00:29:18,475 --> 00:29:20,716
Here's your draft.

380
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:23,099
I think you'll like it.

381
00:29:23,938 --> 00:29:26,939
If I was tough on you before,
I apologise.

382
00:29:27,025 --> 00:29:28,982
I'm not naive.

383
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:30,693
I understand
under certain circumstances,

384
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:32,937
unorthodox methods
may be required.

385
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:34,739
That doesn't excuse
your blackmailing me

386
00:29:34,824 --> 00:29:35,939
by threatening
to arrest my husband.

387
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:38,739
Yeah, don't mention Vasson.
His reputation precedes him.

388
00:29:38,828 --> 00:29:42,244
And nothing about Campbell
or the other prisoners.

389
00:29:42,332 --> 00:29:43,411
Stick with Bristow.

390
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:48,169
Yeah, the rest is fine.
Deliver this to Miller.

391
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:51,374
He has operational control
of the Rotunda while I'm here.

392
00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:56,342
We'll want you back in six hours
to report on the final results.

393
00:30:09,776 --> 00:30:12,812
- Marshall, if I needed you to...
- Check it out. Look.

394
00:30:12,904 --> 00:30:14,564
Telephoto lenses
based on an owl's eye.

395
00:30:14,656 --> 00:30:17,194
Let's say you're out in the
field, and you need to get in...

396
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:20,487
You just press this button.
Whoa. Nice pores. You exfoliate?

397
00:30:20,578 --> 00:30:22,951
If I need you to access
classified documents

398
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,996
on the NSC's computer network,
can you do it?

399
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:28,286
- I don't have access.
- I know.

400
00:30:31,172 --> 00:30:32,797
Forensic guys
are monitoring the network.

401
00:30:32,882 --> 00:30:34,756
Isn't there a way
to bypass that?

402
00:30:34,843 --> 00:30:37,962
Of course. It's me.
But...

403
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:51,855
I give you the codes,
you're gonna bust her out.

404
00:30:51,943 --> 00:30:53,485
Kick some NSC booty.

405
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:56,773
Can I just say, love.

406
00:31:00,201 --> 00:31:04,448
I've been trying to think of
a reason why you saved my life.

407
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:06,247
The conclusion I've come to

408
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:09,701
is that it would incur some
feeling of debt on my part.

409
00:31:09,794 --> 00:31:14,421
As usual, Jack, you're in danger
of outsmarting yourself.

410
00:31:18,053 --> 00:31:21,421
The U.S. government
has pardoned me for my crimes.

411
00:31:21,514 --> 00:31:26,425
The international community
regards me as a humanitarian.

412
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:32,433
Yet you and Sydney still believe
I'm pursuing some hidden agenda.

413
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:37,028
Now, whatever you may perceive
that agenda to be,

414
00:31:37,113 --> 00:31:42,819
clearly it would be easier to
obtain if you were both dead.

415
00:31:43,578 --> 00:31:46,413
Given that you're
my most vocal detractors,

416
00:31:46,498 --> 00:31:50,365
my most capable antagonists.

417
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,377
Or you need us for something.

418
00:31:53,463 --> 00:31:56,630
Something you believe
only we can provide.

419
00:31:58,301 --> 00:32:01,172
Well, you're right about that.

420
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:05,299
No humanitarian endeavour
can ever fill the void

421
00:32:05,392 --> 00:32:08,428
Ieft by my past crimes.

422
00:32:10,355 --> 00:32:13,854
With the death of my wife,

423
00:32:13,942 --> 00:32:18,022
you and Sydney are
my absolution, my penance.

424
00:32:19,489 --> 00:32:22,110
You're all I have left.

425
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:28,155
- Anything?
- Just about.

426
00:32:28,832 --> 00:32:31,370
Should be...

427
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,121
What?

428
00:32:34,212 --> 00:32:37,628
The file that would have the
access codes has been deleted.

429
00:32:38,508 --> 00:32:42,340
All records pertaining to
Camp Williams have been removed.

430
00:32:44,556 --> 00:32:45,505
Michael.

431
00:32:51,604 --> 00:32:52,933
Actually, I'm gonna take off,

432
00:32:53,022 --> 00:32:55,692
'cause this is definitely
something I should not...

433
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:57,400
Pardon me.

434
00:33:00,572 --> 00:33:02,315
You were right about Lindsey.

435
00:33:02,407 --> 00:33:05,906
I thought I could exercise some
control over the interrogation,

436
00:33:05,994 --> 00:33:09,327
but he just wanted a report
whitewashing the whole thing.

437
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,996
I know you're working
on something.

438
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,667
I want to help.

439
00:33:32,187 --> 00:33:34,060
On your feet.
Let's go.

440
00:33:34,147 --> 00:33:34,929
On your feet!

441
00:33:35,023 --> 00:33:36,897
Wait. Hey!

442
00:33:36,983 --> 00:33:38,608
Hey!

443
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:44,019
- What are you doing to him?
- That depends on you.

444
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:50,573
Help me out, Syd.

445
00:33:51,998 --> 00:33:54,869
- Wait.
- There's no time to wait.

446
00:33:56,127 --> 00:33:58,416
You son of a bitch!
Leave him alone!

447
00:33:58,505 --> 00:34:00,296
You can stop this
by deciphering the code.

448
00:34:00,381 --> 00:34:03,252
I will kill you for this!

449
00:34:04,302 --> 00:34:05,465
Oh, my God!
Stop!

450
00:34:05,553 --> 00:34:08,009
Stop. I'll tell you
what it says.

451
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:12,142
They're coordinates.

452
00:34:12,227 --> 00:34:13,685
To what?

453
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,050
I don't know.

454
00:34:15,146 --> 00:34:16,391
For the 100th time,

455
00:34:16,481 --> 00:34:18,189
I don't remember anything
about those two years.

456
00:34:18,274 --> 00:34:20,101
All I can tell you
is what they are.

457
00:34:20,193 --> 00:34:22,945
Alright, tell me.

458
00:34:26,574 --> 00:34:30,702
North 34 degrees,
0-9 minutes, 55.9 seconds,

459
00:34:30,787 --> 00:34:36,161
west 118 degrees,
17 minutes, 15.3 seconds.

460
00:34:36,251 --> 00:34:38,374
Get a team prepped.

461
00:34:43,925 --> 00:34:45,716
Well done.

462
00:34:56,813 --> 00:34:58,521
Oh, my God.

463
00:35:00,942 --> 00:35:02,223
Oh, God.

464
00:35:05,071 --> 00:35:08,571
I'm not Campbell.
I'm Schapker.

465
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:13,317
Your personality profile
revealed your major weakness.

466
00:35:13,413 --> 00:35:17,624
Empathetic suffering
is harder for you to sustain

467
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:19,998
than physical torture.

468
00:35:22,756 --> 00:35:26,919
So, thanks for caring.

469
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:34,423
There's one procedure left,
Agent Bristow.

470
00:35:34,517 --> 00:35:37,803
We'll have the neurostimulation
prepped in about an hour.

471
00:35:37,896 --> 00:35:41,940
We'll finally know what happened
to you in the last two years.

472
00:35:52,535 --> 00:35:55,406
This is a cranial shunt.

473
00:35:55,497 --> 00:35:57,952
After I drill a hole
in your skull,

474
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:00,117
I'll use it to drain the water
from your brainpan.

475
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:03,709
Once you're unconscious,
we'll remove your skullcap

476
00:36:03,797 --> 00:36:06,916
and begin the neurostimulation.

477
00:36:10,136 --> 00:36:11,678
We have an operative inside

478
00:36:11,763 --> 00:36:13,672
who will gain access
to the security room

479
00:36:13,765 --> 00:36:16,386
and initiate a reverse
lockdown protocol,

480
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:20,390
thereby containing the bulk of
the MPs in their patrol areas.

481
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,149
Once entry is made,
we'll proceed to the cellblock

482
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:25,521
where Agent Bristow's
being held.

483
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:28,279
I hope your man inside
knows what he's doing.

484
00:36:28,363 --> 00:36:29,643
She does.

485
00:36:30,782 --> 00:36:33,320
I have Lauren Reed here
to see Director Lindsey.

486
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,529
Wait here. I'll let him know
you're on base.

487
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:40,290
Locking down common area.

488
00:36:47,424 --> 00:36:49,546
I hate to ask the obvious.

489
00:36:49,634 --> 00:36:52,090
What's taking so long?

490
00:36:52,178 --> 00:36:55,263
The override program
has to be placed within 5 inches

491
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:57,341
of the central control station.

492
00:36:57,434 --> 00:36:59,806
Once that happens,
it'll lock the internal doors

493
00:36:59,894 --> 00:37:01,519
and open that main gate.

494
00:37:01,604 --> 00:37:03,015
Then we move.

495
00:37:03,732 --> 00:37:05,854
I'm gonna need a chopper
to Fort Lewis.

496
00:37:05,942 --> 00:37:08,433
I'll check
with the duty officer.

497
00:37:08,528 --> 00:37:10,853
Lauren Reed.

498
00:37:10,947 --> 00:37:13,782
Director Lindsey's told me
all about you.

499
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:17,911
He says you're going to write
a stellar report for us.

500
00:37:25,128 --> 00:37:26,539
Here we go.

501
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,918
Move, move, move!

502
00:37:36,681 --> 00:37:37,844
What is it?

503
00:37:37,932 --> 00:37:39,557
Something's overriding
the system.

504
00:37:39,642 --> 00:37:41,635
All the doors are sealed.

505
00:37:42,979 --> 00:37:44,972
What did you do?

506
00:37:45,065 --> 00:37:46,013
Nothing.

507
00:37:49,444 --> 00:37:50,357
Secure the perimeter.

508
00:37:50,445 --> 00:37:53,446
We can't afford to have
any hostiles on this floor.

509
00:37:55,408 --> 00:37:56,867
I got it.

510
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:06,708
She's not here!

511
00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:34,689
Sydney!

512
00:38:38,868 --> 00:38:39,533
- Sydney.
- Dad!

513
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:42,620
You're alright, sweetheart.
You're alright.

514
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,956
Go, go, go!

515
00:39:23,496 --> 00:39:25,952
He's with us.
Get in.

516
00:39:54,944 --> 00:39:57,614
They wanted a code deciphered.

517
00:40:00,283 --> 00:40:02,988
That's what all this was about.

518
00:40:03,078 --> 00:40:04,785
A code.

519
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:07,117
What was it?

520
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:09,365
Coordinates.

521
00:40:12,504 --> 00:40:15,125
I gave Lindsey
the wrong coordinates.

522
00:40:17,592 --> 00:40:20,427
I didn't know what to do.

523
00:40:26,434 --> 00:40:28,890
You made it, Sydney.

524
00:40:31,314 --> 00:40:33,271
You made it.
