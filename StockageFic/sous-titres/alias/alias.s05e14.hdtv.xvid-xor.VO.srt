1
00:00:04,763 --> 00:00:05,763
She's not here.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,242
Repeat, Anna is not in the car.

3
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:16,452
Get out of my way!

4
00:00:16,453 --> 00:00:18,274
I won't let you, stop!

5
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:19,376
Nadia, move!

6
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:22,562
I have betrayed everyone I ever loved,

7
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:26,224
but I was chosen,
and this is my road to follow.

8
00:00:26,764 --> 00:00:27,764
Welcome back.

9
00:00:36,326 --> 00:00:39,126
Today, we shouldn't focus
on what we lost,

10
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:43,536
but what we gained
by having Nadia in our lives.

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,812
I not only gained a sister,
but a friend.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,433
When I think of the years of loneliness
she had,

13
00:00:55,203 --> 00:00:58,537
no family to speak of, not knowing
where she truly belonged,

14
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:02,885
I am so grateful for the warmth
and affection

15
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,787
she was surrounded by in the end.

16
00:01:07,823 --> 00:01:10,065
She taught me the meaning of family.

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,728
That it goes deeper than blood...

18
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:20,786
that it starts with friendship...

19
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:27,396
and it comforts me to know that
although she was taken far too soon,

20
00:01:29,012 --> 00:01:30,436
what she left me with

21
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:33,166
will stay with me forever.

22
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,667
How could I have trusted him again?

23
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,097
After everything?

24
00:01:59,323 --> 00:02:00,716
You thought he'd changed.

25
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:02,647
Nadia didn't.

26
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:07,036
I convinced her that he deserved
a second chance.

27
00:02:09,893 --> 00:02:11,227
I showed him compassion.

28
00:02:15,513 --> 00:02:17,296
I won't make that mistake again.

29
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,296

Transcript: Raceman

31
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:31,277
- Has he asked for anything?
- No, just a pitcher of water.

32
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,826
How's it coming?

33
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,577
Page 47, have you decoded it yet?

34
00:02:45,823 --> 00:02:48,388
As I told you before,
it's going to take time,

35
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,325
more time if these interruptions
continue.

36
00:02:52,701 --> 00:02:55,285
It's been almost a week already,
Mr. Sloane.

37
00:02:57,382 --> 00:02:59,987
So when do you think
we may see some results?

38
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:03,397
This is isn't a crossword puzzle,
Ms. Peyton.

39
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:07,066
The key to Rambaldi's endgame
is encoded within that manuscript

40
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,907
where it has remained hidden
for the past 500 years.

41
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:12,155
I hardly think

42
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:13,905
that a week is unreasonable.

43
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,587
Perhaps you'd like to take a walk
around the grounds,

44
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:23,598
something to clear your mind,
allow you to focus.

45
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:26,035
And I'm sure the armed gentleman
posted outside the door

46
00:03:26,092 --> 00:03:28,296
won't mind if I slip away
for a bit of lunch.

47
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:29,586
You're not a prisoner,

48
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:31,405
if that's what you're asking.

49
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:34,968
But given your fugitive status,
you can understand our reservations

50
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:37,058
about letting you walk around in public.

51
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:38,298
Yes, of course.

52
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,998
I know you've had to make
some tough sacrifices.

53
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,835
We all have.

54
00:03:48,823 --> 00:03:50,685
You think I'm having
a crisis of conscience

55
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,015
because I killed Nadia?

56
00:03:53,142 --> 00:03:54,286
Let me be clear.

57
00:03:56,413 --> 00:03:57,875
No one will stand between me

58
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:00,488
and the fulfillment
of Rambaldi's ultimate vision.

59
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:03,928
No one.

60
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:08,392
And unless you and your superiors
know someone else who's familiar

61
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:10,536
with 15th-century cryptography,

62
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:14,015
I'm sure you can wait a few more days.

63
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,428
Of course.

64
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,625
If there's anything we can do
to expedite your work,

65
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,395
you'll let me know?

66
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:35,068
Have you ever seen
anything like that before?

67
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,936
It's basically
a solid state memory chip.

68
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:39,276
Cutting edge tech,
at least it was back in the '70s,

69
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:42,168
which I'm guessing is
when this little guy was made.

70
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:44,067
What was it doing inside Renee?

71
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:47,287
That's the million-dollar question,
isn't it?

72
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,877
Basically,
there's several hundred kilobytes of...

73
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:53,427
data on this thing.
Problem is, it's all encoded.

74
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:55,825
I would have thought
30-year-old encrypted algorithms

75
00:04:55,872 --> 00:04:56,967
wouldn't present a problem.

76
00:04:57,002 --> 00:04:59,035
Well, they wouldn't if the code
was complete, but

77
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:02,136
half the data's missing,
probably corrupted over time.

78
00:05:02,671 --> 00:05:05,915
Without it, I can't create
a baseline for encryption analysis.

79
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,865
And you can't extrapolate
the missing data?

80
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:10,036
I'm trying to, but I'm not going
to hold my breath.

81
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:12,086
What about these markings?
What are these?

82
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,127
It's probably nothing,

83
00:05:14,683 --> 00:05:16,998
Maybe just a serial number, maybe,

84
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,937
or, the name of the company that desi...

85
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:23,357
- What is it?
- Hold on a sec.

86
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,465
I'll put it up on the monitor.

87
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:30,836
- We should tell Sydney.
- I'll do that.

88
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:32,218
In the meantime, Marshall,

89
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:34,096
<i>do whatever takes to break
that encryption.</i>

90
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:35,786
<i>I want to know what else
is on this chip,</i>

91
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:38,456
<i>and I want to know
what it was doing inside Renee.</i>

92
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,935
We just got a hit
on one of the hard lines.

93
00:05:43,131 --> 00:05:44,115
Contact Peyton.

94
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,758
I'm sending it over now.

95
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:53,957
Isabelle,

96
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:55,715
will you please sleep?

97
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,955
Sweetie...

98
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,997
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, sweetheart.

99
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,367
Isn't this her nap time?

100
00:06:14,612 --> 00:06:15,656
I wish.

101
00:06:16,051 --> 00:06:18,596
Apparently, this little girl
doesn't need sleep anymore.

102
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:20,905
We got a collective
four hours last night.

103
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:22,045
It must be genetic.

104
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:25,425
You used to wake up at 4:00am
every day like clockwork.

105
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,648
I am sorry about that.

106
00:06:27,923 --> 00:06:29,926
Did Marshall finish his analysis
of the chip?

107
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:31,597
Actually, that's why I'm here.

108
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:33,788
Marshall found data on it,
all of it encrypted,

109
00:06:33,862 --> 00:06:35,446
but he also found something else.

110
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:41,307
Vaughn's name was etched
on the outside of the device,

111
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,235
his real name... André Michaux.

112
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:45,097
Wait, what?

113
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:48,978
Marshall believes the chip was placed
inside Renée almost 30 years ago.

114
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:51,652
Vaughn and Renée
didn't know each other 30 years ago.

115
00:06:51,652 --> 00:06:53,447
No, but their fathers did.
Vaughn told you

116
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:55,497
they were working together
against Prophet Five.

117
00:06:55,532 --> 00:06:56,655
And you're thinking what,

118
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,195
that one of them
implanted the chip inside Renee?

119
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,095
At this point, it's
the most likely presumption.

120
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,315
- Why? Why would they...
- I don't know,

121
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,875
but someone left Vaughn's name on it
intentionally, expecting it to be found.

122
00:07:10,092 --> 00:07:11,908
It's possible he may have
some understanding

123
00:07:11,971 --> 00:07:13,598
of what the chip contains.

124
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:16,735
Dad, no.

125
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,758
As far as Prophet Five is concerned,
Vaughn is dead.

126
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:22,956
- Involving him at this point...
- A calculated risk, I know.

127
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:24,342
He's still in recovery.

128
00:07:24,342 --> 00:07:25,877
- He is not field-ready.
- I know.

129
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:28,008
I'll do everything I can to protect him.

130
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:30,342
We'll have an agent dead-drop the chip
to Vaughn.

131
00:07:30,342 --> 00:07:31,336
He'll never be seen.

132
00:07:31,481 --> 00:07:32,537
- Dad...
- Sydney,

133
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,075
we don't have a choice.

134
00:07:34,673 --> 00:07:36,878
Sloane's decision to openly join
Prophet Five

135
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,336
suggests that they're close
to their endgame.

136
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:41,955
Right now this chip is our only lead.

137
00:07:46,622 --> 00:07:49,087
But if someone's going
to take that chip to Vaughn, it's me.

138
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,977
<i>Syd's en route to Nepal
to see someone</i>

139
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:54,917
<i>who may be able
to decipher the chip.</i>

140
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:56,785
<i>Who's the contact?<i>

141
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:58,573
<i>Someone who worked with Renee.</i>

142
00:07:58,573 --> 00:07:59,906
<i>That's all Jack told me.</i>

143
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:02,556
This contact Sydney's meeting in Nepal,

144
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,612
do you have any idea who it is?

145
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,393
You busy?

146
00:08:39,443 --> 00:08:41,647
Just trying to catch up
on the latest tech.

147
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:42,857
What's going on?

148
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,238
When was the last time
you went to a movie?

149
00:08:48,603 --> 00:08:49,885
The last movie?

150
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,416
I used to go to movies all the time, and

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,897
I haven't be in so long, because

152
00:08:56,342 --> 00:08:58,326
there's always something
more important to do.

153
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:02,415
This isn't about going
to the movies, is it?

154
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:05,417
When you were working at The Shed,

155
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,107
did you ever see an agent buried?

156
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,518
- It takes a while to get over it.
- What if I can't?

157
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,807
What if I'm not cut out for this?

158
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:20,656
First it was Gordon Dean,
and now it's Sloane.

159
00:09:21,543 --> 00:09:23,995
They were right in front of me
the whole time deceiving me,

160
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:25,518
and I was oblivious.

161
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,408
You're a good agent, Rachel.

162
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,108
Listen...

163
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,955
I would tell you if I didn't think
you could handle this.

164
00:09:57,612 --> 00:10:01,008
I'd like to place a classified ad
in next week's edition.

165
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:06,725
A child?

166
00:10:08,163 --> 00:10:10,288
Yes, that's right.
Sydney has a daughter.

167
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:12,796
What's her name?

168
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:15,167
Isabelle.

169
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,357
I suppose Vaughn is the father
or was the father, I should say.

170
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:23,797
Yes, that's right.

171
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,575
In this business,

172
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:29,528
it's always the children who suffer.

173
00:10:33,723 --> 00:10:35,675
Arvin, it troubles you, doesn't it?

174
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:38,157
Looking at me,

175
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,386
seeing her look back at you.

176
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:43,316
You're nothing like her.

177
00:10:44,162 --> 00:10:45,718
I suppose you know what I'm like.

178
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:46,906
Of course I do.

179
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:48,888
You're driven by anger.

180
00:10:49,972 --> 00:10:50,976
You crave power,

181
00:10:51,153 --> 00:10:53,936
which I assume was something
you were deprived of in childhood.

182
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:56,877
Sydney, on the other hand,
is driven by a sense of duty,

183
00:10:56,952 --> 00:10:58,938
of loyalty to those she loves.

184
00:10:59,662 --> 00:11:01,615
That's where she gets her strength.

185
00:11:03,471 --> 00:11:05,147
It's also what makes her weak.

186
00:11:06,223 --> 00:11:08,327
Attachments are a vulnerability,

187
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:10,125
which are easily exploited.

188
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:13,108
And yet, she somehow
always manages to best you.

189
00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:16,396
And now a victory
she's not even aware of.

190
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:19,295
Tell me,

191
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:23,285
I imagine you do your best
to avoid mirrors... yes?

192
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,987
And I suppose you believe
you're driven by faith.

193
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,515
Look where it's gotten you.

194
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,166
Something tells me being Prophet Five's
newest pawn wasn't exactly your endgame.

195
00:11:35,923 --> 00:11:38,506
Unlike yourself, I know my place
in the big picture.

196
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:42,055
You, however, will continue
to deceive yourself

197
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,516
if you think you're anything more
than dispensable.

198
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,105
This...

199
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,986
...procedure that you've undergone...

200
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,935
Surely there must be a reason why
they want you to look like Sydney.

201
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,298
And when that purpose is fulfilled,

202
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:57,706
you will become unnecessary.

203
00:11:59,982 --> 00:12:00,986
Lovely catching up.

204
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:15,998
<i>The truth is you're no different
than she is.</i>

205
00:12:20,142 --> 00:12:21,757
You're dispensable, too.

206
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:53,997
Miss Bristow...

207
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:57,677
I'm Nabin.

208
00:12:58,802 --> 00:13:00,507
I'm afraid you must have overlooked me.

209
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:03,376
Yes, I did.

210
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,685
It's no matter.

211
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:06,357
You yourself are hard to overlook.

212
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,035
In fact...

213
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:10,227
You're just as lovely
as Mr. Vaughn described.

214
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:14,387
Mr. Vaughn...

215
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,437
Don't tell him I told you.

216
00:13:16,822 --> 00:13:18,288
He talks about you all the time.

217
00:13:19,263 --> 00:13:21,296
Come, my car is just this way.

218
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:23,566
The drive up to Tambor
is only 20 minutes.

219
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:26,208
How is Mr. Vaughn?

220
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,287
He's recovering very well.

221
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,816
Nicely healed, I should think.

222
00:13:30,513 --> 00:13:31,517
Here we are.

223
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:34,115
Can I help you with the bag?

224
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:41,458
Hurry!

225
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:42,777
We don't have much time.

226
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,125
His name's Nabin.

227
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,435
Michael Vaughn sent him
to pick up agent Bristow.

228
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:48,855
Vaughn?

229
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,537
- Isn't he...
- Apparently not.

230
00:13:52,023 --> 00:13:53,955
- I'll see you at the intercept point.
- Wait.

231
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:56,228
Wear this.

232
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:07,807
- Nabin?
- Miss Bristow.

233
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,246
Welcome to Nepal.

234
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,197
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

235
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,196
Mr. Vaughn is so eager to see you.

236
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:16,506
<i>No, this is definitely not good,
all right?</i>

237
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,236
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>

238
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:18,757
Answer me this:
When will you have

239
00:14:18,783 --> 00:14:20,367
the one with the comfort grip in stock?

240
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,356
<i>I'll transfer you
to customer service.</i>

241
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:23,775
<i>Ask for the manager. His name...</i>

242
00:14:23,783 --> 00:14:25,728
I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?
I can't...

243
00:14:25,753 --> 00:14:27,418
<i>Can you hear me?</i>
- No. It's just...

244
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:28,838
There's like a clicking sound.

245
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,006
Do you hear that clicking?

246
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:31,875
No. But I'll have the manager
give you a call.

247
00:14:31,893 --> 00:14:33,525
Alright... Why don't you have him...

248
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:35,177
- call me? Thank you.
<i>- Alright.</i>

249
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:36,116
Thank you for nothing.

250
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:37,077
<i>Thank you for calling.</i>

251
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,565
We're out of coffee.

252
00:14:53,403 --> 00:14:54,178
Coffee?

253
00:14:54,202 --> 00:14:54,948
Yeah...

254
00:14:54,952 --> 00:14:56,246
I know you might not...

255
00:14:56,761 --> 00:14:57,827
...think that's important.

256
00:14:57,852 --> 00:14:59,006
A lot of people don't...

257
00:14:59,153 --> 00:15:00,808
...don't drink coffee.
Generally might...

258
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,558
say that you should have some tea or...

259
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:05,296
Some soda, which also has some...

260
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:07,915
...caffeine, but I'm telling you,
it's not the same.

261
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:08,722
It's...

262
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:09,726
...important.

263
00:15:13,052 --> 00:15:13,988
You're sure about this?

264
00:15:13,991 --> 00:15:16,016
Positive. I noticed a glitch
on the phone,

265
00:15:16,032 --> 00:15:17,687
so I checked the PBX controls.

266
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:19,585
According to the records,

267
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,337
Sloane logged on to the network,

268
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:23,755
and he put the entire phone system
on some sort of

269
00:15:23,982 --> 00:15:25,495
passive surveillance mode, which...

270
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:27,238
I didn't even know was possible!

271
00:15:27,341 --> 00:15:28,577
How did he get access?

272
00:15:28,863 --> 00:15:31,717
All of his authorization codes
were revoked four days ago.

273
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:33,615
I was thinking the same thing but,
remember,

274
00:15:33,622 --> 00:15:35,446
Sloane installed most of the systems.

275
00:15:35,762 --> 00:15:38,385
He must have installed
some sort of backdoor in the network.

276
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:40,707
Listen, for the past 24 hours,

277
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,865
Sloane and most likely
Prophet Five have been

278
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:45,906
able to monitor every conversation
inside A.P.O.

279
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:48,817
We need to contact Sydney immediately.

280
00:15:54,472 --> 00:15:55,187
Hello.

281
00:15:55,272 --> 00:15:56,915
Sydney? Listen to me very carefully.

282
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,355
<i>Are you with your contact?</i>

283
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,965
Yeah, I am.

284
00:16:00,431 --> 00:16:02,135
There's been a security breach at A.P.O.

285
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,108
It was Sloane.

286
00:16:03,602 --> 00:16:06,076
<i>We have reason to believe
you've been compromised.</i>

287
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:11,717
No, we're right on time, actually.
I'll call you once we arrive.

288
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:18,695
Cell phones. They are a miracle.

289
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,368
Don't slow down. Just go around.

290
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,215
You're in a hurry. I understand.

291
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:31,177
But perhaps, shouldn't we stop to help?

292
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:14,975
Hello, Sydney.

293
00:17:35,893 --> 00:17:37,485
Well, that was fairly easy.

294
00:17:37,942 --> 00:17:38,906
Of course,

295
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:42,176
if I'd known it was in Renée,
I would have saved us both the trouble

296
00:17:42,182 --> 00:17:43,566
and cut it out of her myself,

297
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:44,897
when I slit her throat.

298
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,235
Wait....

299
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,056
Anna...

300
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,826
Sorry, Syd. Don't have time to chat.

301
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:52,668
I've got a date.

302
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,145
Now...

303
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,546
I don't know exactly

304
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:58,915
what I'm going to do
with your boyfriend.

305
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:01,257
But whatever it is,

306
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:03,467
I'll have fun doing it.

307
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:16,986
Are you okay?

308
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:19,085
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

309
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:23,037
Actually, the doctor says
I don't need this anymore.

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,375
I think it looks debonair.

311
00:19:26,351 --> 00:19:27,397
It does.

312
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:31,006
God, I missed you.

313
00:19:46,243 --> 00:19:47,326
How is she?

314
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,908
Isabelle.

315
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:54,115
She's beautiful.

316
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:56,868
Just like her mother.

317
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:00,595
Isabelle.

318
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:03,186
Isabelle. You named her Isabelle.

319
00:20:04,652 --> 00:20:06,058
You like it?

320
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,417
Yeah, it was my idea, wasn't it?

321
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:11,656
What is it you wanted? Clementine?

322
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,998
Not a day's gone by
that I didn't want to call you,

323
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,115
talk to you.

324
00:20:22,212 --> 00:20:24,218
I had this fear I'd never see you again.

325
00:20:25,743 --> 00:20:26,756
Silly, huh?

326
00:20:28,423 --> 00:20:29,435
Maybe a little.

327
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:41,286
<i>I'm assuming this is good news.</i>

328
00:20:41,543 --> 00:20:42,866
Have you made any progress?

329
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,345
No.

330
00:20:44,532 --> 00:20:47,398
Unfortunately, I've discovered
an anomaly in the composition.

331
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,456
Joseph Pinara's influence
in Rambaldi's encryption.

332
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,615
Pinara was a 14th-century cleric
who published...

333
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,745
I'll skip the history lesson,
if you don't mind.

334
00:20:58,613 --> 00:20:59,757
"Le Libraire".

335
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:03,395
It's a private seller
of used books in Geneva.

336
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:06,775
They have a copy
of the Pinara manuscript.

337
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:10,337
I can't decipher Page 47 without it.

338
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,556
Fine.

339
00:21:12,732 --> 00:21:14,646
Write down the address.
I'll get it myself.

340
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:18,277
Very well.

341
00:21:29,332 --> 00:21:31,485
How long do you think
you can deceive them?

342
00:21:33,351 --> 00:21:34,765
Page 47...

343
00:21:36,882 --> 00:21:39,577
Eventually they're going to find out
you already know what it says.

344
00:21:42,312 --> 00:21:43,437
You're stalling.

345
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,616
You must have some plan.

346
00:21:46,832 --> 00:21:48,367
What do you want from me, Nadia?

347
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,178
I don't want anything.

348
00:21:53,162 --> 00:21:54,977
Why don't you understand,

349
00:21:55,343 --> 00:21:56,397
Nadia?

350
00:21:59,091 --> 00:22:01,928
Every sacrifice I've ever made
has been for the greater good.

351
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,538
Yet every sacrifice you've made
has come at someone else's expense.

352
00:22:09,682 --> 00:22:10,877
Or have you forgotten?

353
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:15,055
Oh, no, I haven't forgotten.

354
00:22:16,113 --> 00:22:17,445
I play it over in my mind.

355
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:20,285
The irony.

356
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,166
All those years I was worried
about your well-being.

357
00:22:24,351 --> 00:22:26,196
And now I realize in the end,

358
00:22:26,893 --> 00:22:28,138
I had no choice.

359
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,855
You still believe that, don't you?

360
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:35,247
That your actions
are controlled by fate?

361
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,378
That you were chosen?

362
00:22:39,263 --> 00:22:40,307
Why, dad?

363
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:45,008
Surely you must ask yourself
why would Rambaldi choose you?

364
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:47,435
You're not a man of honor.

365
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:49,696
You're not particularly courageous.

366
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,006
You're charitable, but only
when it serves your own interest,

367
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,895
and last but not least,

368
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:57,977
you murder the people you claim to love.

369
00:22:58,501 --> 00:23:00,398
What do you want from me, Nadia?

370
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,015
I don't want anything.

371
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,728
Then why are you here?

372
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,175
Dad...

373
00:23:07,372 --> 00:23:09,436
I'm here because you want me here.

374
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,666
Now you can pursue Rambaldi
and have your daughter at the same time.

375
00:23:15,632 --> 00:23:17,218
Isn't that what you said you wanted?

376
00:23:17,713 --> 00:23:19,195
Just before you killed me?

377
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:22,458
No...

378
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,567
Not like this.

379
00:23:27,092 --> 00:23:28,165
Sir?

380
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:30,987
Do you need anything?

381
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,385
I thought I heard you talking.

382
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,356
No.

383
00:23:38,403 --> 00:23:39,437
I'm fine.

384
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,737
I can't believe Renée's dead.

385
00:23:44,961 --> 00:23:47,167
If it hadn't been for her,
I wouldn't have known about

386
00:23:47,231 --> 00:23:49,027
Prophet Five or the truth of my father.

387
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:50,866
None of it.

388
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:54,947
Who killed her?

389
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:57,998
Anna Espinosa.

390
00:23:58,482 --> 00:23:59,886
Anna? She was in jail.

391
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,585
Apparently Prophet Five
arranged for her release.

392
00:24:06,902 --> 00:24:08,016
What do you think it is?

393
00:24:10,052 --> 00:24:10,975
I don't know.

394
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,487
Renée never mentioned it.

395
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,585
Marshall couldn't decode it?

396
00:24:15,723 --> 00:24:17,536
He thought part of the code
might be missing.

397
00:24:19,052 --> 00:24:20,785
Unless the data's been corrupted.

398
00:24:20,823 --> 00:24:22,837
He thinks it was in her body
since she was a kid,

399
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,748
maybe 30 years.

400
00:24:26,471 --> 00:24:27,588
What is it?

401
00:24:28,942 --> 00:24:30,178
Where was it, exactly?

402
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,885
- What do you mean?
- Inside Renée's body,

403
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,896
where was it?

404
00:24:35,763 --> 00:24:37,196
I don't know. Why?

405
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,655
My father once told me a story
that I had a bike accident

406
00:24:42,712 --> 00:24:44,688
when I was a kid,
drove it right into a tree.

407
00:24:45,332 --> 00:24:47,196
And even though
I have no recollection of it,

408
00:24:47,471 --> 00:24:49,877
I never questioned him,
because it left me with this scar.

409
00:24:55,051 --> 00:24:56,828
Maybe the code isn't corrupted at all.

410
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,517
Maybe there's another half.

411
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,115
Okay, this might prevent infection,

412
00:25:06,953 --> 00:25:08,388
but it won't help with pain.

413
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:13,276
Yeah, well, you can handle childbirth,
I can handle this.

414
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,246
I'm in good hands.

415
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:22,028
You need to sit very still.

416
00:25:23,283 --> 00:25:25,965
- This is going to hurt.
- Yeah, I know. You mentioned that.

417
00:25:26,051 --> 00:25:27,408
It's okay. I trust you.

418
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:44,147
Hello.

419
00:25:44,321 --> 00:25:45,436
<i>Dad, it's me.</i>

420
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:47,497
Sydney, are you okay?

421
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,652
<i>You were right.</i>
The mission's been compromised.

422
00:25:49,652 --> 00:25:51,067
Anna knows about Vaughn.

423
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,853
Where are you?

424
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:54,265
Wait, dad, listen to me.

425
00:25:54,712 --> 00:25:55,716
It gets worse.

426
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:57,675
I've been doubled.

427
00:26:01,631 --> 00:26:03,076
You need to stay still.

428
00:26:03,903 --> 00:26:04,925
Think about some things.

429
00:26:04,961 --> 00:26:07,105
Yeah, well,
give me something to think about.

430
00:26:07,312 --> 00:26:08,737
Tell me about Isabelle.

431
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:12,478
Well, she has your eyes,

432
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,398
the same... blue-green.

433
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:19,116
And her smile is... is like your smile.

434
00:26:19,903 --> 00:26:22,426
- Really?
- Yeah, but her chin is pointy.

435
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:24,465
It's like mine. It's cute.

436
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,725
Oh, God, I can't wait to meet her!

437
00:26:28,942 --> 00:26:30,118
I got it.

438
00:26:33,113 --> 00:26:34,118
Apply pressure.

439
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,728
Same etchings?

440
00:26:40,423 --> 00:26:41,425
"Renée Goursaud."

441
00:26:43,192 --> 00:26:44,426
Yeah, can I see that?

442
00:26:52,871 --> 00:26:54,058
Perfect fit.

443
00:27:10,532 --> 00:27:13,238
I'm looking for a manuscript
by Joseph Pinara.

444
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,485
I called ahead.

445
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,037
Wait one moment.

446
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:17,895
I've got it right over here.

447
00:27:23,383 --> 00:27:25,146
Your receipt is in the book.

448
00:27:25,491 --> 00:27:26,497
Nothing else?

449
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,048
No, that'll be all.

450
00:27:29,723 --> 00:27:30,727
Thanks.

451
00:27:41,602 --> 00:27:44,378
I believe there is someone
trying to contact you.

452
00:27:44,552 --> 00:27:45,615
No, it wasn't him.

453
00:27:46,313 --> 00:27:48,785
It was a woman,
but she knew the protocol.

454
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:58,587
German.

455
00:27:59,032 --> 00:28:00,035
Yeah.

456
00:28:01,383 --> 00:28:04,327
Looks like some sort
of emergency evacuation plan.

457
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,318
Continuity of government
from the cold war.

458
00:28:09,011 --> 00:28:10,785
It's a nuclear fallout bunker.

459
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,715
Hamburg, Germany, under Bergner park.

460
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:16,378
You think there's something there?

461
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,586
Maybe.

462
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,896
I'm going to go with you to find out.

463
00:28:20,043 --> 00:28:21,415
Look, I know what you're thinking.

464
00:28:21,443 --> 00:28:23,325
I'm not ready,
but, Syd, you said it yourself.

465
00:28:23,352 --> 00:28:24,377
My father left this map.

466
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,398
Chances are, when you get there,
you may need my help.

467
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:29,325
You're right.

468
00:28:29,983 --> 00:28:31,396
I'll call for transport.

469
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,585
Okay.

470
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:03,318
What I'm about to tell you
is not to leave this room.

471
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,525
Agent Vaughn is alive.

472
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,058
I knew it! I knew it!

473
00:29:08,103 --> 00:29:10,007
I knew he couldn't be... dead.

474
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:11,878
For the last several months,

475
00:29:11,903 --> 00:29:15,856
Vaughn's been kept in a secure location
in Nepal pending his recovery.

476
00:29:15,941 --> 00:29:17,900
I hope you can all
understand that secrecy

477
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,556
was a necessary measure
to ensure his safety.

478
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,065
Unfortunately,
those measures weren't sufficient.

479
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:24,700
Through Sloane's tapping of our network,

480
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,825
prophet five learned
of Sydney's trip to Nepal.

481
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,837
They sent an agent to intercept her.

482
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:30,675
- Is she okay?
- She's fine.

483
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:34,038
She made it to Vaughn's location,
but Vaughn was no longer there.

484
00:29:34,091 --> 00:29:35,167
He was abducted.

485
00:29:35,752 --> 00:29:37,235
In a matter of speaking.

486
00:29:39,641 --> 00:29:41,657
We managed to pick up the trail.

487
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:45,916
This was taken in the Hamburg
international airport one hour ago.

488
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:48,646
The woman in the photo is not Sydney.

489
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,967
You sure you got the coordinates right?

490
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:07,505
What happened to Bergner park?

491
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:09,227
A lot changes in 30 years,

492
00:30:10,112 --> 00:30:12,146
but those bunkers
were steel-reinforced concrete.

493
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,478
It would be pretty tough
to demolish something like that.

494
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,717
My guess is that they're still under
there. We just have to find a way in.

495
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,378
You know,
that diamond store over there--

496
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,876
it probably has some
pretty expensive pieces.

497
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,028
Chances are
they're locked away every night.

498
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,887
In some sort of
basement storage room, maybe?

499
00:30:29,031 --> 00:30:30,035
Worth a try.

500
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,648
How do you want to handle this?

501
00:30:33,741 --> 00:30:35,216
Like we did in Cartagena.

502
00:30:36,642 --> 00:30:37,946
I'll follow your lead.

503
00:30:47,382 --> 00:30:48,545
Okay, let's go.

504
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,277
Do you really think
you're going to get away with this?

505
00:30:58,301 --> 00:30:59,566
You're out of your league.

506
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:01,150
They killed Vaughn. They killed Renée.

507
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,901
They've probably killed Sydney by now.

508
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:04,986
Stop, Nadia. Just stop.

509
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:09,907
They're better than you, smarter.

510
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:13,026
What makes you think you stand a chance?

511
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,285
This should solve all your problems.

512
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:17,676
The Pinara manuscript.

513
00:31:18,383 --> 00:31:19,386
I hope it helps.

514
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,302
Well,
with all the work that has to be done,

515
00:31:31,302 --> 00:31:32,778
I'll get out of your way.

516
00:31:35,411 --> 00:31:38,355
Unfortunately,
I seem to be getting in my own way.

517
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,526
How is that?

518
00:31:42,912 --> 00:31:46,316
The effects of losing a child
cannot be underestimated.

519
00:31:46,882 --> 00:31:47,886
You're right.

520
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:48,938
I am distracted.

521
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:52,588
In order for me to concentrate
on the future,

522
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:56,095
I need to make peace with the past.

523
00:32:02,012 --> 00:32:03,735
Oh, baby, look at this one.

524
00:32:06,351 --> 00:32:08,266
- Really?
- Oh, it's gorgeous!

525
00:32:09,003 --> 00:32:11,376
No, I'd prefer that one there.
It's, you know...

526
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:13,258
- it's a little less big.
- No, no, no, no.

527
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,436
Is there anything you would like to see?

528
00:32:15,451 --> 00:32:17,155
Hi. Is this a princess cut?

529
00:32:17,222 --> 00:32:18,227
Yes, it is.

530
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,885
Your girlfriend has very good taste.

531
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,242
Yeah, for that price,
she might as well be a princess.

532
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:26,827
It costs nothing to try on.

533
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:37,736
A stone of that quality
has this effect on some people.

534
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,005
No, she has seizures.

535
00:32:39,011 --> 00:32:40,565
Kelly, just breathe. It's okay.

536
00:32:40,623 --> 00:32:42,316
Could I get some help here, please?

537
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:43,707
It's okay. Just relax.

538
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,176
How do I get access downstairs?

539
00:32:50,521 --> 00:32:52,255
My keys... take my keys.

540
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,316
Watch him.

541
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,983
I'm in Hamburg, Bromestrasse 123.

542
00:33:13,983 --> 00:33:15,196
I'll need an extraction.

543
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,528
Don't hurt me, please.

544
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:18,007
I'll do whatever you ask.

545
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,295
Then shut up.

546
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:38,837
Thanks.

547
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:40,438
I've got it from here.

548
00:34:42,491 --> 00:34:43,498
Who are you?

549
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:46,306
It's a pity you'll never know.

550
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,035
Sydney and I never went to Cartagena.

551
00:35:01,423 --> 00:35:04,366
And just for the record,
you're a terrible kisser.

552
00:35:13,272 --> 00:35:15,697
I always said Sydney
was too good for you.

553
00:35:40,101 --> 00:35:41,917
Let's see if this one's loaded.

554
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:04,975
Are you all right?

555
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,325
Yeah, I'm fine. How did you...

556
00:36:44,571 --> 00:36:46,696
Okay, we can go now.

557
00:37:28,401 --> 00:37:32,887
Project summaries, test subjects,
names, dates-- it's all here.

558
00:37:33,213 --> 00:37:35,272
Your father's research of prophet five.

559
00:37:35,272 --> 00:37:38,058
Most of these organizations
still exist, Syd.

560
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:39,398
We can end it all.

561
00:37:42,652 --> 00:37:43,685
Hang on.

562
00:37:51,663 --> 00:37:52,668
Go ahead.

563
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,257
I got your message.
Did you get the chip?

564
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,196
Yes. I'm done here.

565
00:37:57,422 --> 00:37:58,426
Good.

566
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:00,157
Bleichen and Bromestrasse.

567
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,538
We should be there in five minutes.

568
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:04,486
That was Peyton.

569
00:38:04,931 --> 00:38:06,542
She's coming to extract Anna.

570
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:07,547
Who's Peyton?

571
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:12,143
Sloane is part of this.

572
00:38:12,143 --> 00:38:13,735
He works with prophet five.

573
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:16,208
He killed Nadia.

574
00:38:17,652 --> 00:38:19,307
This is my chance to stop him.

575
00:38:21,152 --> 00:38:22,155
I know.

576
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,707
You can't go back to A.P.O.

577
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:29,587
There are moles within the government.
We can't trust anyone.

578
00:38:31,671 --> 00:38:33,716
Contact my father.
Explain the situation.

579
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,028
Okay, I will.

580
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:38,988
Here, take this.

581
00:38:40,242 --> 00:38:42,827
It's useless to them
without the other half.

582
00:38:42,861 --> 00:38:44,396
Take the tracking device in your phone

583
00:38:44,401 --> 00:38:46,388
and embed it in the chip
before you hand it over.

584
00:38:46,422 --> 00:38:48,585
We'll be able to track your movements.

585
00:38:49,153 --> 00:38:50,158
I have to go.

586
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,066
I know.

587
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,036
Be careful.

588
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:26,345
We were expecting
to hear from you sooner.

589
00:39:26,393 --> 00:39:28,285
I ran into a few complications.

590
00:39:29,543 --> 00:39:31,155
Nothing I couldn't handle.

591
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:34,585
And Sydney?

592
00:39:36,592 --> 00:39:37,598
She's dead.

593
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:44,007
This is what they found
inside Renée Rienne.

594
00:39:48,663 --> 00:39:49,767
Nice work.

595
00:39:50,383 --> 00:39:52,345
Well, if you were able to pull this off,

596
00:39:52,382 --> 00:39:53,835
the rest should be easy.

597
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:55,976
Yeah.

598
