1
00:00:01,369 --> 00:00:02,600
Drop your weapons!

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,851
I need suppressive fire!

3
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,883
  

4
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:09,970
You wanted to see me?

5
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:12,051
Has Vaughn contacted you yet?

6
00:01:15,652 --> 00:01:17,886
I'd have mentioned it, don't you think?

7
00:01:18,353 --> 00:01:21,257
Sydney, we pulled Vaughn's phone records,

8
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:25,876
and they indicate that he sent you an SM message to your cell.

9
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:29,691
I would like to give you the benefit of the doubt

10
00:01:29,784 --> 00:01:34,408
and assume that it got lost in transmission and that you never received it.

11
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,670
If you're looking to catch me in a lie, yes, I got the message.

12
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:45,030
When Vaughn took off, as I've already told you, I tried to stop him.

13
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,960
He hit me.

14
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:51,043
He contacted me to tell me he was sorry.

15
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:53,989
Which I didn't consider professionally relevant.

16
00:01:54,954 --> 00:01:58,476
As far as where he is or what he's doing, I still have no idea.

17
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:02,679
He disappeared with a dangerous piece of technology.

18
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:05,437
I have no choice but to notify Langley.

19
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,098
Vaughn isn't a traitor. He would never do what he's doing without a reason.

20
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:12,289
Vaughn went rogue on a sanctioned mission.

21
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,183
Out of consideration for you,

22
00:02:14,836 --> 00:02:18,028
I'll give him 48 hours to either return

23
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:20,592
or contact me with an explanation.

24
00:02:20,638 --> 00:02:24,784
In the meantime, we will withhold his status from the rest of A.P.O.

25
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:26,434
Should this matter come to light,

26
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:29,814
I don't want anyone else complicit in this deception.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,850
Thank you.

28
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,342
Sydney?

29
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:36,278
If Vaughn should contact you...

30
00:02:36,697 --> 00:02:38,025
You'll know.

31
00:02:51,634 --> 00:02:52,484
Non, merci.

32
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:03,628
Going somewhere?

33
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:06,737
- You're late.
- Hardly.

34
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:08,634
I've been watching you for an hour.

35
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:10,342
Yeah? Am I your type?

36
00:03:10,528 --> 00:03:14,005
Had to make sure you came alone, followed instructions.

37
00:03:14,145 --> 00:03:15,377
Beignet?

38
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:16,891
Can we just get this done?

39
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,210
Look around. It's Paris in the springtime.

40
00:03:19,302 --> 00:03:20,724
I'm only interested in answers.

41
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:22,862
In exchange, you were supposed to bring me something today.

42
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:24,233
Your big prize is in a safe place.

43
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:25,750
That's not the deal.

44
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:27,168
It is now.

45
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,853
You're bluffing.

46
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,116
Don't forget, I know how desperate you are.

47
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,956
No way you're willing to walk away.

48
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:38,189
Oh, I suppose that depends on how badly you want it.

49
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,091
'Cause personally, what the hell am I gonna do with a transforming coil?

50
00:03:41,183 --> 00:03:42,797
Talking personally?

51
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:44,977
I don't have a use for it either.

52
00:03:45,116 --> 00:03:47,973
Well, then you can tell your employer exactly what I'm telling you.

53
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:51,427
You'll get the coil when you tell me everything you know about my father.

54
00:04:03,213 --> 00:04:04,590
- A volcano?
- Yeah. Yeah.

55
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:07,727
It's all of yellowstone. It's like a funnel.

56
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:11,964
And the thing is that on average, it blows every 600,000 years.

57
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:13,555
Well, then I don't think we have to worry about it.

58
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:17,794
No, no, no. It hasn't blown for 600,030 years. We're due, sister.

59
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:19,308
What is this? Fancy chocolate?

60
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:20,014
That's not for you.

61
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:21,958
No, it is. I like fancy chocolate.

62
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,950
Where is the freezer bag? I left it in the car.

63
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:25,227
- I'll get it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

64
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,533
You chill.

65
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:34,441
Hello?

66
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:37,675
You have a collect call from prisoner 41958

67
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:39,671
from the Quantico women's detention center.

68
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:41,951
- Do you accept the charges?
- Yes, I do.

69
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:44,512
- Nadia?
- Hello, Katya.

70
00:04:44,606 --> 00:04:45,838
I was worried about you.

71
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:48,165
I'm sorry. I couldn't get away yesterday,

72
00:04:48,258 --> 00:04:49,759
but I'm planning to visit tomorrow.

73
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,417
That's wonderful.

74
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:53,316
I have a little gift for you.

75
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:56,600
Forgive me for calling. It's just that your visits,

76
00:04:56,694 --> 00:04:58,402
it makes this place bearable.

77
00:04:58,494 --> 00:04:59,822
I'll be there tomorrow.

78
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,419
Uh, you heard from Vaughn?

79
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:09,983
Mnh-mnh. Not yet.

80
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:11,499
It's got to be tough on him, right?

81
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:16,589
Going to visit your uncle, and all you can do is watch him die,

82
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,106
nothing you can do about it?

83
00:05:18,197 --> 00:05:18,904
Yeah.

84
00:05:19,698 --> 00:05:21,408
My mom used to do stuff like that.

85
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,542
Like what?

86
00:05:22,634 --> 00:05:23,865
Scrub the sink

87
00:05:24,146 --> 00:05:27,717
when she was worried about stuff that was out of her control.

88
00:05:27,763 --> 00:05:28,899
I like a clean sink.

89
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:29,745
Mm-hmm.

90
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:32,595
But you would tell me if there was something that I needed to be concerned about?

91
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:34,963
Of course.

92
00:05:36,973 --> 00:05:38,826
Yeah, it's me. No deal.

93
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:42,665
He says he has the coil but he wants answers first.

94
00:05:45,283 --> 00:05:46,658
He wants to talk to you.

95
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:49,825
Hello?

96
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,722
You violated our agreement.

97
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,195
You listen to me. I'm sick and tired of these games.

98
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:55,758
Here's how we're gonna do things.

99
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,368
You're angry? Good.

100
00:05:57,461 --> 00:05:59,984
You  can channel that into your next assignment.

101
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:03,077
No, no. No more assignments. You got what you asked for.

102
00:06:03,151 --> 00:06:04,907
You didn't abide by the terms of our deal.

103
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:06,656
The price has just gone up.

104
00:06:06,796 --> 00:06:09,842
Disobey again, and it will continue to do so.

105
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:10,976
No, that's it. I'm done.

106
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:13,924
- Check beneath the table.
- What?

107
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:17,907
Beneath the table there's an envelope. Open it.

108
00:06:37,317 --> 00:06:40,363
If you still wish to back out, feel free to do so.

109
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:44,913
He's alive.

110
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:47,682
Your  father is very much alive.

111
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:51,721
The question, Mr. Vaughn, is how far are you willing to go to find him?

112
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:38,227
That was lovely.

113
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:43,407
It's a folk song our father used to sing about a russian robin hood.

114
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,544
It was one of your mother's favorites.

115
00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:49,555
So good to see you again, sweetheart.

116
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,876
- Shouldn't be a problem.
- Sorry, I just --

117
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:58,528
Well, considering the hearings, I'm sure the D.D.O. has his hands full.

118
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,948
Of course. Give my regards.

119
00:08:01,323 --> 00:08:03,270
Sorry, um, requisition forms.

120
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:05,024
The secure server to Langley went down.

121
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,499
I did what I could, but I'll need all-new servers and a VS-2 module, so...

122
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:11,255
Great. If you could also sign here...

123
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:15,372
Uh, by the way, since the, you know, incident,

124
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:18,115
have you had a chance to see a doctor?

125
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,294
'Cause the radiation levels in that chamber were near-lethal, so...

126
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:23,239
I'm fine, Marshall. Is there anything else?

127
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:25,757
No. Thank you.

128
00:08:59,235 --> 00:09:01,995
Our family didn't have much. Just the necessities.

129
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:06,131
But your mother had no intention of denying herself.

130
00:09:06,223 --> 00:09:09,079
After school, she would go to the St. Basil cathedral

131
00:09:09,265 --> 00:09:12,550
where all the tourists were, so careless with their money,

132
00:09:12,644 --> 00:09:15,117
so easy to pickpocket.

133
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:18,238
- How old was she?
- Young.

134
00:09:18,377 --> 00:09:19,561
Still in grade school.

135
00:09:21,383 --> 00:09:24,048
She used the money to buy us candy

136
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:27,744
until our father discovered what she had been doing.

137
00:09:28,397 --> 00:09:30,298
Yelena and I were terrified, but not your mother.

138
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:35,540
She stood there finishing the candy, smiling.

139
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:38,049
We were waiting for her to get hit,

140
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:44,333
but instead our father laughed looking at this little rebel in front of him.

141
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,324
Your mother can be quite stubborn, much like your sister.

142
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:54,934
How is Sydney?

143
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,235
Katya, I've told you --

144
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,610
I know, I know. She's off limits.

145
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,570
Thank you.

146
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,260
Of course.

147
00:10:11,957 --> 00:10:13,284
My mother --

148
00:10:13,377 --> 00:10:15,945
Irina -- did she ever talk about me?

149
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,345
It's happening sooner than I expected.

150
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,479
What's happening?

151
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:27,773
I'm deathly allergic to chocolate.

152
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:30,645
In 15 seconds,

153
00:10:32,468 --> 00:10:34,350
my breathing will become difficult.

154
00:10:34,444 --> 00:10:35,294
Katya --

155
00:10:35,414 --> 00:10:37,506
And I will lose consciousness.

156
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:44,129
Tell Sydney this is how far I'm willing to go to see her.

157
00:10:44,316 --> 00:10:46,694
Guard! I need help now!

158
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,488
- Tell Sydney!
- Guard!

159
00:10:50,935 --> 00:10:52,121
I know what you're thinking.

160
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,014
You'll find them on your own, right?

161
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:55,936
What are we doing here?

162
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:59,870
Waiting. I hired a team of independent contractors to help us with the job.

163
00:10:59,962 --> 00:11:00,860
Which is what?

164
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,202
- Assume that's not important.
- Assume it is to me.

165
00:11:03,294 --> 00:11:07,425
All you need to know is it's an instruction manual of sorts.

166
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,748
Now that coil you got for us --

167
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,878
apparently it wasn't being used properly.

168
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,396
That's terrific. Like I said, I don't care about the coil.

169
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:17,507
I'm just like you, man.

170
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:19,042
The less I know, the less guilt I feel.

171
00:11:19,134 --> 00:11:20,652
Yeah, we're a lot alike.

172
00:11:20,885 --> 00:11:23,072
Where do you think he was during the funeral?

173
00:11:24,427 --> 00:11:28,095
I mean, when you were mourning by his grave with your mom.

174
00:11:28,936 --> 00:11:30,452
You know, it's usually a girlfriend.

175
00:11:31,668 --> 00:11:33,663
At least that's why my old man took off.

176
00:11:34,552 --> 00:11:36,308
But I tell you what. My mom --

177
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,079
can't say I really blame him.

178
00:11:44,597 --> 00:11:45,684
Coming?

179
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,312
Waste of time.

180
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:55,104
.45 caliber. It's not like you need to make it more dangerous.

181
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:58,281
Maybe not, but it makes me feel better.

182
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,090
You said an hour.

183
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:04,690
Yeah, well, we had to take a detour.

184
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:06,459
This is Mike.

185
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:11,125
So is he any good, or just eye candy?

186
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:15,269
Like I said, he's the man with the technical skills to get what we need done.

187
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:18,552
That's Sabina, this is Gregor, and that's Jan over there.

188
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:21,213
Mikey, pour you a pint.

189
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:24,241
I don't usually drink till the job's finished.

190
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:27,428
You drink with me, or you cut bullets with Jan. Your choice.

191
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:30,185
Yeah, well, how about I do neither and you tell me why the hell we're here.

192
00:12:32,382 --> 00:12:34,521
Okay, so this is a two-pronged plan.

193
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:36,595
Now, tomorrow at midnight,

194
00:12:36,642 --> 00:12:40,500
an armored transport will be leaving Darmstadt carried a very valuable item.

195
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:42,726
We will be stealing that item.

196
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,713
But to do it, we're gonna need a cold laser.

197
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:48,368
Prototype has not even hit the streets yet.

198
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:52,453
It's in a secure R&D wing in a private hospital in Bordeaux.

199
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:54,390
Heavily guarded.

200
00:12:54,465 --> 00:12:55,506
C ivilians?

201
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:57,306
Yeah. You got a problem with that?

202
00:12:59,083 --> 00:12:59,885
No.

203
00:13:03,765 --> 00:13:05,188
I got your message. What is it?

204
00:13:05,796 --> 00:13:08,126
Dixon has been taken out of the field of rotation.

205
00:13:08,218 --> 00:13:10,071
I know. I authorized it.

206
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:12,825
Yes, I see your signature all over the release forms.

207
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:16,043
Do you really think we can afford to be down one agent

208
00:13:16,135 --> 00:13:17,844
when Vaughn's whereabouts are still unknown?

209
00:13:17,937 --> 00:13:19,170
We didn't have a choice.

210
00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:21,968
The director of the DSR contacted me directly.

211
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:25,872
And since for the moment we're keeping Vaughn's status confidential,

212
00:13:26,132 --> 00:13:28,462
I thought it best to comply with his request.

213
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:29,736
I see.

214
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,727
What exactly is the nature of Dixon's assignment?

215
00:13:33,193 --> 00:13:34,903
I'm afraid that's confidential as well.

216
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:36,753
From you or from me?

217
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:43,280
Come on, Jack, you don't have to be a genius to know what this is about.

218
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:46,103
Rambaldi.

219
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,794
Now while I accept that these matters are above my purview,

220
00:13:49,886 --> 00:13:51,882
Dixon is a member of my task force,

221
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:56,072
and it's my responsibility to know what actions and risks he's taking on.

222
00:13:57,989 --> 00:13:59,650
It's a routine transport.

223
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:01,482
Darmstadt.

224
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:04,811
And I assure you the risks are minimal.

225
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:08,982
Syd, Clippers tickets. Third row, center. I can't go.

226
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:11,068
Langley's tasked me for a special assignment.

227
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,105
You're kidding.

228
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:14,144
Well, I would love to, but I'm swamped.

229
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:15,516
And I was going to go with my son,

230
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:19,843
so I tell him I can't go. He says it's actually good because he has a date.

231
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:20,669
He's 12.

232
00:14:20,764 --> 00:14:22,089
Why doesn't he take her to the game?

233
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,891
Apparently she'd rather go to a movie.

234
00:14:23,984 --> 00:14:25,148
I'm sure you've taught him well.

235
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:27,284
- Dinner when I get back?
- Yeah. Sure.

236
00:14:29,575 --> 00:14:30,662
We need to talk.

237
00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:34,416
How long have you been seeing her?

238
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:35,738
It was our third visit.

239
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:38,743
This is --

240
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:41,638
this is exactly why I warned you about her.

241
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:42,945
Katya's the only person

242
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:45,988
who has ever been willing to answer my questions about Irina.

243
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:48,317
Irina Derevko was manipulative and cruel.

244
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:50,118
She was also our mother.

245
00:14:50,211 --> 00:14:52,492
Which makes it harder to accept, I know, but trust me --

246
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:54,152
I know her crimes.

247
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,335
I also know how once she helped you and the CIA.

248
00:14:57,428 --> 00:15:00,234
Until she betrayed us. She always did.

249
00:15:00,328 --> 00:15:03,041
There's more to her than what's in her file.

250
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:04,700
Katya told me stories.

251
00:15:05,026 --> 00:15:06,306
And you believed her?

252
00:15:06,492 --> 00:15:07,486
Some of it, yes.

253
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:09,574
Then you're deluding yourself, Nadia.

254
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:13,280
I'm sorry.

255
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:15,698
I've been through this before.

256
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:18,784
Katya is doing the same thing to you that Irina did to me.

257
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,777
Telling me what I wanted to hear,

258
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:24,536
appealing to what I wanted more than anything else in the world -- a mother.

259
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,183
A family.

260
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:29,787
It was all a manipulation.

261
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,580
Do you want to know the truth about our mother?

262
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:40,105
Our mother put a hit on my life.

263
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,572
Our mother tried to have me killed.

264
00:15:47,676 --> 00:15:49,959
Why didn't you tell me?

265
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,948
There was never a reason to.

266
00:15:53,397 --> 00:15:57,544
Oh, my god, Syd. If I knew, I --

267
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:03,241
Where is she? Katya?

268
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:05,973
She's in the hospital.

269
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,810
They're keeping her for observation.

270
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,711
I always hated going to the doctor.

271
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,095
Let's go get the laser.

272
00:17:20,017 --> 00:17:20,724
There it is.

273
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,703
I need some light.

274
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,737
How long will this take?

275
00:17:32,437 --> 00:17:35,197
Hold still. We can't risk destroying the emitter.

276
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,284
Wire cutters.

277
00:17:38,388 --> 00:17:40,001
Can't we just unplug it or something?

278
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,135
Sure, if you don't mind blowing it up

279
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,842
and killing us both in the process.

280
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:45,071
Argon canister. It's under pressure.

281
00:17:45,772 --> 00:17:47,052
So you're CIA.

282
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,945
Is that what Roberts told you?

283
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:51,225
He said you were in a period of transition.

284
00:17:51,457 --> 00:17:52,881
I guess you could say that.

285
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:54,682
I went through the training program.

286
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:55,857
Camp Perry.

287
00:17:56,604 --> 00:18:00,034
Cia was looking for female agents with russian language skills.

288
00:18:00,406 --> 00:18:02,019
They rejected me.

289
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,342
Yeah, but you're probably better off.

290
00:18:03,622 --> 00:18:06,668
That's what I figure. More profit...

291
00:18:08,396 --> 00:18:10,012
and more fun, too.

292
00:18:13,378 --> 00:18:14,658
This should do it.

293
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:17,634
Let me help.

294
00:18:17,728 --> 00:18:19,006
I'm good, thanks.

295
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:41,366
Bon. D'accord.

296
00:18:59,232 --> 00:18:59,891
Look out!

297
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,456
Let's go.

298
00:19:09,486 --> 00:19:10,718
We need to leave now.

299
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:20,570
You could use a few stitches, I suppose.

300
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,797
That  won't be necessary.

301
00:19:22,545 --> 00:19:25,735
Fine. Let it scar. Who knows?

302
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:27,871
It might toughen you up a bit.

303
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,221
I saw the look on your face when I killed that guard.

304
00:19:33,062 --> 00:19:34,389
I saved your life.

305
00:19:35,744 --> 00:19:36,547
Thanks.

306
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,752
Don't tell me you're torn up inside.

307
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:44,795
I thought you agency boys were tougher than that.

308
00:19:44,841 --> 00:19:47,171
It was him or me. I'm okay with that.

309
00:19:47,264 --> 00:19:48,878
You could have fooled me.

310
00:19:49,018 --> 00:19:51,777
You haven't stopped brooding since we left the hospital.

311
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:56,064
Yeah, well, maybe it's because I don't like being here with you.

312
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:01,326
You know what I think?

313
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:05,917
This is exactly where you want to be.

314
00:20:24,997 --> 00:20:29,446
Consider this the second time you've been rejected by the CIA.

315
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:40,126
Understand this.

316
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:45,171
Talk to my sister again, I will make sure you regret it.

317
00:20:45,263 --> 00:20:48,071
The protective sister. How charming.

318
00:20:49,193 --> 00:20:51,476
And how satisfying it must be for you to know

319
00:20:51,568 --> 00:20:53,277
you have it all figured out.

320
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:55,822
I would think you of all people

321
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,770
should know the world is never black or white.

322
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:01,374
The last time I saw you, aunt Katya,

323
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,844
you tried to put a bullet in my head.

324
00:21:03,965 --> 00:21:06,773
Given the opportunity, I wouldn't mind seeing you suffer.

325
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:10,214
Consider this visit a warning.

326
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,887
Leave Nadia alone.

327
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:17,259
I had no intention of killing you, nor did your mother.

328
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:23,168
What do you know about that?

329
00:21:26,815 --> 00:21:31,200
I know you believe your mother put out a contract on your life.

330
00:21:31,949 --> 00:21:36,619
Surely you must have asked yourself why she would want you eliminated.

331
00:21:36,757 --> 00:21:40,377
And I'm willing to bet you haven't come up with a satisfying answer.

332
00:21:40,984 --> 00:21:42,312
Your mother loved you.

333
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:46,155
And to look at you now and see how quickly you've abandoned her --

334
00:21:46,248 --> 00:21:47,862
if she only knew, she would be ashamed.

335
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:49,262
I'm not having this conversation.

336
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,543
Before dying, Irina tried to contact me.

337
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:54,807
She believed someone was setting her up,

338
00:21:54,992 --> 00:22:00,093
wanting it to appear that she was trying to have you killed.

339
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,700
I need you to get me that message.

340
00:22:02,885 --> 00:22:03,974
Bring it to me.

341
00:22:05,077 --> 00:22:07,503
It's the least you could do for her.

342
00:22:14,285 --> 00:22:15,258
Marshall.

343
00:22:16,129 --> 00:22:17,982
Mr. Sloane.

344
00:22:18,074 --> 00:22:20,167
Hey. Sorry. You know the classics.

345
00:22:20,258 --> 00:22:21,394
Never go out of style.

346
00:22:21,488 --> 00:22:24,820
A test tube was sent to forensics for analysis. Did you authorize that?

347
00:22:26,317 --> 00:22:27,051
Yes.

348
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:28,701
Yes, I did. Uh...

349
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:31,189
Is that a problem, or...

350
00:22:31,328 --> 00:22:33,181
There's no problem. Just a curiosity.

351
00:22:34,114 --> 00:22:38,307
It's indicated that the blood sample was one of Dr. Vlachko's test subjects.

352
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:40,205
I thought we already analyzed those.

353
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:42,247
Am I missing something, Marshall?

354
00:22:42,386 --> 00:22:45,337
Uh, you know what? I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately.

355
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:47,425
Mitchell's got an ear infection,

356
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,375
and I just probably forgot to send it in. Sorry.

357
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:51,411
Sorry about that.

358
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:54,197
Did the results come back?

359
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:56,656
It's nothing we didn't already know.

360
00:22:56,748 --> 00:22:59,416
The subject was suffering from a large-scale genetic mutation.

361
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:01,441
However, Marshall,

362
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,429
I want you to know there are protocols in this office.

363
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,691
I'm sure your failure to notify me of this submission

364
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,605
is also due to your lack of sleep, yes?

365
00:23:10,663 --> 00:23:13,005
Yes. It probably was.

366
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,450
I'm very tired, and I'm not...

367
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:22,719
Why complicate our life?

368
00:23:22,813 --> 00:23:25,955
We could get on and off without the transport even knowing they were hit.

369
00:23:26,095 --> 00:23:27,756
That item we want is extremely delicate.

370
00:23:27,848 --> 00:23:29,798
I mean, we can't risk the transfer in a moving vehicle.

371
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,220
I thought you said we were stealing an instruction manual.

372
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:36,357
We are. A very old one written by an inventor in the 15th century.

373
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:38,730
You breathe on it wrong, and it will crumble.

374
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:40,349
Seems like a lot of trouble for an old book.

375
00:23:40,442 --> 00:23:44,052
It's valuable to my employer, so then it's valuable to us.

376
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,557
Okay, it's gonna be a two-car caravan.

377
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,739
The lead car's going to be the armored transport.

378
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:51,066
It'll be leaving the depot at midnight tonight

379
00:23:51,392 --> 00:23:53,197
traveling along this route.

380
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,334
- We're hitting a CIA convoy?
- That's right.

381
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:56,803
So this is why you needed me.

382
00:23:56,942 --> 00:23:58,154
From the moment you contacted me,

383
00:23:58,247 --> 00:24:00,673
you knew you'd need that bypass, even if I had given you the coil --

384
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:03,382
We'd have never told you where your father is. That's right.

385
00:24:03,661 --> 00:24:05,466
Guess that makes us bad people, huh?

386
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,650
Nothing's changed, though. You still want answers.

387
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,690
You son of a bitch.

388
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:10,826
You know, by the way, you should be thanking me.

389
00:24:11,153 --> 00:24:13,195
- You should be grateful.
- Thanking you for what?

390
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:14,615
For tracking your father down.

391
00:24:15,034 --> 00:24:17,125
Let me tell you something. That wasn't no small feat.

392
00:24:17,311 --> 00:24:18,544
Your father's been hiding for the past --

393
00:24:18,638 --> 00:24:20,442
You're asking me to betray my agency.

394
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:22,054
Well, I feel really bad about that.

395
00:24:22,547 --> 00:24:25,546
You know what? I'll say an extra Hail Mary tonight before I go to bed.

396
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,528
If I do this, I can't go back.

397
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:32,143
That has a certain poetry to it, doesn't it?

398
00:24:32,983 --> 00:24:34,788
Like father, like son.

399
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:36,557
Me?

400
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:38,022
I came this far,

401
00:24:38,581 --> 00:24:40,434
I'd have crossed the finish line.

402
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,996
But like I said

403
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:43,318
I'm a bad guy.

404
00:24:46,076 --> 00:24:49,267
Oh, guess what? Your dad is, too.

405
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:52,246
I mean, he's not being held prisoner.

406
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:57,666
And for 25 years, he allowed his wife and his kid to think that he's been dead?

407
00:24:58,974 --> 00:25:00,589
That's a bad guy.

408
00:25:01,944 --> 00:25:04,800
You think on that. I'll be inside.

409
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:18,566
I need to speak with you.

410
00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:20,737
Of course. What is it?

411
00:25:21,063 --> 00:25:24,589
I wanted to tell you before you were notified through official channels.

412
00:25:24,868 --> 00:25:26,864
I've been visiting Katya Derevko.

413
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:33,016
Your aunt? And I assume it's not on official business.

414
00:25:33,063 --> 00:25:34,253
No. It was personal.

415
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:38,974
I thought Katya might be able to fill in the blanks about my mother,

416
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:40,676
tell me who she was.

417
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:43,866
I see.

418
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:45,042
Well...

419
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:47,017
thank you for telling me.

420
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:51,142
Nadia?

421
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,337
What did she tell you?

422
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,087
Nothing I didn't already know.

423
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,167
That she was a criminal. A murderer.

424
00:26:03,543 --> 00:26:08,023
Sweetheart, no one is a single thing.

425
00:26:09,426 --> 00:26:12,041
Look, I understood Irina.

426
00:26:12,275 --> 00:26:14,606
We were both cut from the same cloth.

427
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:17,124
Both committed to our work.

428
00:26:17,544 --> 00:26:19,493
And I suppose because of that,

429
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:22,108
we both did some things that are unforgivable.

430
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:23,940
But, Nadia,

431
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:29,824
Irina is also capable of having a great capacity for love.

432
00:26:30,431 --> 00:26:32,187
I saw the way she looked at Sydney.

433
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,187
The way she held that child in her arms.

434
00:26:37,684 --> 00:26:40,683
And I am absolutely sure she felt the same way about you.

435
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,407
She searched for you, Nadia.

436
00:26:46,511 --> 00:26:49,415
She may not be here to answer your questions,

437
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:53,238
but the one thing I know to be true --

438
00:26:55,435 --> 00:26:57,478
your mother loved you.

439
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,787
I'd like to believe that.

440
00:27:02,172 --> 00:27:02,975
Then do.

441
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:21,561
Have a wonderful day.

442
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:26,370
Hi, I'm here to pick up a repair.

443
00:27:26,462 --> 00:27:29,128
Of course. You have the service ticket?

444
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:32,745
Nope, just the number. 112402.

445
00:27:32,838 --> 00:27:34,595
Give me just a moment.

446
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:49,679
Quite lovely, isn't it?

447
00:27:51,501 --> 00:27:52,446
Open it.

448
00:28:06,196 --> 00:28:08,185
How much do I owe you?

449
00:28:08,324 --> 00:28:11,276
Nothing. It's already been paid for.

450
00:28:12,444 --> 00:28:14,440
- Have a lovely day.
- Thank you.

451
00:28:18,276 --> 00:28:19,105
Hello?

452
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,387
Hello?

453
00:28:25,848 --> 00:28:26,506
Vaughn?

454
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:34,096
Vaughn, say something.

455
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,449
We're gonna do this my way.

456
00:28:52,823 --> 00:28:54,531
You want to pull this off, I'm taking charge.

457
00:28:54,624 --> 00:28:55,618
Sure thing.

458
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:58,465
That truck will be heavily guarded,

459
00:28:58,557 --> 00:28:59,933
loaded with state-of-the-art surveillance.

460
00:29:00,027 --> 00:29:01,831
I want RF jammers on every team member.

461
00:29:06,461 --> 00:29:09,556
Now, an item this important, the CIA is gonna use their best agents.

462
00:29:09,696 --> 00:29:12,456
Even the smallest mistake will compromise our mission.

463
00:29:12,689 --> 00:29:14,303
We can use the cold laser to open the safe,

464
00:29:14,397 --> 00:29:17,492
but without the proper code, the safe's backup system will engage.

465
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,766
Once we're inside, I'll bypass the safe's backup system

466
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,712
while Sabina sets up the cold laser.

467
00:29:22,851 --> 00:29:24,084
We'll have no more than three minutes.

468
00:29:37,788 --> 00:29:38,734
One last thing,

469
00:29:38,966 --> 00:29:40,580
because there'll be no shooting on this job.

470
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:42,234
CIA protocol.

471
00:29:42,373 --> 00:29:44,417
They will not fire unless fired upon first.

472
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:48,635
If anyone has a problem with anything I just said, speak up now.

473
00:29:48,773 --> 00:29:50,341
- We understood?
- All right.

474
00:29:50,433 --> 00:29:50,995
All right.

475
00:30:09,429 --> 00:30:10,517
You have a minute?

476
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:12,019
Of course.

477
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:17,683
I wanted to apologize about going to Katya.

478
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:18,863
I should have told you.

479
00:30:19,002 --> 00:30:20,425
You don't have to apologize.

480
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,053
When I found out Arvin Sloane was my father, I was horrified.

481
00:30:26,755 --> 00:30:31,998
My entire life I wanted to meet my parents, and the truth was so...

482
00:30:32,092 --> 00:30:33,163
ugly.

483
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:37,819
But he's changed. There's good in him.

484
00:30:38,426 --> 00:30:41,952
I guess I was hoping the same thing was true for our mother.

485
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:44,734
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

486
00:30:47,117 --> 00:30:50,070
That's Eric. We're going out for lunch. You want to come?

487
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,301
No, thanks. I'm just gonna hang out here.

488
00:30:52,441 --> 00:30:54,055
- Okay.
- Have fun.

489
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:25,525
Here we go.

490
00:33:09,126 --> 00:33:10,167
We've secured the hole.

491
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,447
Copy, strike team. They're clueless. No idea you're hitching a ride.

492
00:33:15,177 --> 00:33:16,981
110 seconds till x-fer.

493
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:18,913
Now we'll see how good you really are.

494
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:20,836
Oh, I'm good.

495
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,187
You got 95 seconds.

496
00:33:32,766 --> 00:33:34,333
- How you doing?
- Ready.

497
00:33:44,248 --> 00:33:45,242
Almost there.

498
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:52,694
All right, here we go.

499
00:33:55,828 --> 00:33:57,059
Nice timing.

500
00:33:58,695 --> 00:34:00,357
Strike team, report. What's going on?

501
00:34:01,948 --> 00:34:03,571
- What the hell is going on?
- Package secured.

502
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,717
Strike team, get ready for impact.

503
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:28,565
Turn back.

504
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:32,639
Let's go.

505
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:38,732
Drop the weapons!

506
00:34:43,598 --> 00:34:44,286
No!

507
00:34:48,635 --> 00:34:50,917
I need suppressive fire! Now!

508
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:15,301
Come on! We can still get away!

509
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:39,784
Dixon, report. Do you copy?

510
00:35:39,922 --> 00:35:41,584
Two hostages escaped into the tunnel!

511
00:35:41,677 --> 00:35:43,625
Hostages in tunnel. Do you copy?

512
00:35:56,911 --> 00:35:58,429
Got to hand it to you, man.

513
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:00,990
You a closer. Let's see 'em.

514
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:03,295
Where's the manuscript?

515
00:36:06,989 --> 00:36:08,650
He's been dead all along, hasn't he?

516
00:36:08,743 --> 00:36:09,119
What?

517
00:36:09,213 --> 00:36:10,970
My father would never have done this.

518
00:36:11,111 --> 00:36:12,246
Man, have you lost your mind?!

519
00:36:12,385 --> 00:36:14,716
My father's dead, you son of a bitch, and you used that.

520
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:19,289
The truth! I want to hear you say it. He's been dead all along.

521
00:36:19,382 --> 00:36:20,423
Man, you've seen the pictures!

522
00:36:20,518 --> 00:36:21,939
Yeah, I've seen a lot of things.

523
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,492
All right, you want me to say it? Fine. He's been --

524
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:29,404
The truth! Tell me the truth!

525
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:31,480
Whoa! Okay. Okay.

526
00:36:32,601 --> 00:36:34,934
He's dead, man. Okay? He's dead.

527
00:36:35,072 --> 00:36:36,448
- What else?
- What?

528
00:36:36,915 --> 00:36:38,337
The rest of it. How'd he die?

529
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,283
- Man, you know the rest!
- Say it!

530
00:36:41,218 --> 00:36:42,927
Irina Derevko killed him.

531
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:47,234
The pictures, the witnesses, the journals -- everything was fake.

532
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,077
Everything.

533
00:36:50,385 --> 00:36:52,236
Who else? Who set me up?

534
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,421
- Who do you work for?
- Please, you know --

535
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:04,303
Who do you work for?!

536
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:06,101
Tell me!

537
00:37:14,005 --> 00:37:15,027
Sloane.

538
00:37:15,493 --> 00:37:17,250
I work for Sloane.

539
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:31,815
You found the message.

540
00:37:32,142 --> 00:37:33,039
Bank records.

541
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:36,081
Payments to the assassin who tried to kill me.

542
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:38,072
- The records exonerate Irina.
- Yes.

543
00:37:38,213 --> 00:37:41,785
Sydney, whoever did this,

544
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:46,189
for your mother, my sister, we have to make it right.

545
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:47,416
We have --

546
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,036
You already know who it was.

547
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,526
My mother traced the bank payments to their source.

548
00:37:57,178 --> 00:37:58,697
She discovered who it was.

549
00:38:00,146 --> 00:38:01,091
In that case --

550
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,969
Oh, if I would have gotten the message in time.

551
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:06,625
She would still be alive.

552
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:09,771
Who is it?

553
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,503
Before I tell you, you must promise me

554
00:38:19,092 --> 00:38:21,041
Nadia can never know.

555
00:38:28,355 --> 00:38:31,644
You're probably gonna want to kill me when I tell you this, but

556
00:38:32,064 --> 00:38:33,344
I ran some tests.

557
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,523
What kind of tests?

558
00:38:35,598 --> 00:38:38,407
You may be very sick, Mr. Bristow.

559
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:40,540
Now, you'll need additional bloodwork to be sure --

560
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:42,295
I thought I made myself clear, Marshall.

561
00:38:42,481 --> 00:38:44,144
This is not something I care to discuss.

562
00:38:44,236 --> 00:38:46,567
I understand. Just hear me out. You have a mutation.

563
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:48,034
Marshall, I've heard enough.

564
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:50,056
Damn it, you may not care what happens to you,

565
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,044
but what happens to you affects other people.

566
00:38:52,137 --> 00:38:54,087
Sydney, for example. Have you thought about that?

567
00:38:54,225 --> 00:38:55,934
You need to see a doctor now.

568
00:38:59,535 --> 00:39:00,671
Is everything all right here?

569
00:39:01,887 --> 00:39:02,957
We were just finishing up.

570
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,502
Yeah. Just finishing up.

571
00:39:11,114 --> 00:39:11,821
Jack...

572
00:39:13,224 --> 00:39:15,008
is there something we need to discuss?

573
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:25,629
Hi.

574
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:27,081
Hi.

575
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,842
He's dead, Syd -- my father.

576
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,410
He's been dead all along.

577
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:58,990
I think.

578
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:02,604
You know, I've --

579
00:40:03,492 --> 00:40:05,440
I've lived with his death for so long,

580
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:07,721
I would have done anything just to see him again.

581
00:40:09,497 --> 00:40:11,064
But then I realized that

582
00:40:11,391 --> 00:40:13,912
my father, he would have never left my mom and me,

583
00:40:14,005 --> 00:40:15,094
not for anything.

584
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:19,646
The man I knew could have never walked away from the people he loved.

585
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:22,520
How did you know?

586
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,030
'Cause I couldn't either.

587
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:36,067
It was Sloane.

588
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,590
I should have seen it all along.

589
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:43,709
I swear to god, Syd, I am gonna kill that son of a bitch.

590
00:40:47,451 --> 00:40:48,730
Come inside.

591
00:40:49,804 --> 00:40:51,371
There's something I have to tell you.

592
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:01,293
Jack.

593
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:04,649
I just spoke with Sydney. Vaughn's returned.

594
00:41:06,332 --> 00:41:07,229
Where was he?

595
00:41:07,603 --> 00:41:10,363
I'll be debriefing him tomorrow. He retrieved the coil.

596
00:41:10,737 --> 00:41:13,258
It's on its way to the DSR facility for analysis.

597
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:14,436
Good.

598
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:15,522
One more thing.

599
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:17,896
Dixon ran into some interference abroad.

600
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:20,026
He's okay. He had his vest on.

601
00:41:20,633 --> 00:41:23,396
But you were right to be concerned.

602
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:26,510
What about the DSR transport?

603
00:41:26,788 --> 00:41:28,833
The artifact has been secured.

604
00:41:30,142 --> 00:41:30,945
Okay.

605
00:41:31,785 --> 00:41:33,495
Unless there's something else, I'm headed out.

606
00:41:33,726 --> 00:41:36,583
No. Have a good evening, Jack.

607
00:41:36,815 --> 00:41:37,617
You, too.

608
00:41:57,825 --> 00:41:58,914
Mr. Sloane?

609
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:03,236
I'm sorry to report, Mr. Sloane, we didn't recover the manuscript.

610
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:05,271
And Roberts hasn't reported in.

611
00:42:11,585 --> 00:42:12,482
I see.

612
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:17,171
Nothing changes.

613
00:42:18,013 --> 00:42:22,349
Everything proceeds as planned.

614
00:42:22,913 --> 00:42:27,349
