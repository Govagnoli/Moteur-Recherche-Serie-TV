1
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:05,648
My name is Sydney Bristow.

2
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:10,820
Seven years ago, I was recruited
by a branch of the CIA called SD-6.

3
00:00:10,903 --> 00:00:14,490
I was sworn to secrecy, but I
couldn't keep it from my fiancé.

4
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:18,035
And when the head of SD-6
found out, he had him killed.

5
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:23,124
That's when I learned the truth.
SD-6 is not part of the CIA.

6
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:26,418
I'd been working for the people
I thought I was fighting.

7
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:29,672
I went to the only place
that could help me take them down.

8
00:00:29,755 --> 00:00:35,010
Now, I'm a double agent for the CIA.
My handler is Michael Vaughn.

9
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:41,434
Only one other person knows what
I do. Another double agent in SD-6.

10
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:44,019
Someone I hardly know.

11
00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:45,771
My father.

12
00:00:47,356 --> 00:00:50,568
- Didn't Syd say she went to Seattle?
- Yeah. So?

13
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:54,196
Why is there a ticket
from Italy in her pocket?

14
00:00:56,198 --> 00:00:59,535
I came here to pass along
an order from Devlin.

15
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:04,415
You're going to see a counsellor
for trauma evaluation.

16
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:10,045
Khasinau's just converted
$250m worth of assets into cash.

17
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:12,298
We need to know
what he spends it on.

18
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:14,049
You leave for Vienna tonight.

19
00:01:20,473 --> 00:01:22,975
Noah? Oh, my God!

20
00:01:23,976 --> 00:01:26,479
Do me a favour, Syd.
Tread carefully here.

21
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:29,273
Until he debriefs,
I wouldn't get too friendly.

22
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,609
It's history. It was five years ago.

23
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,656
You were the last person that I ever
wanted to see again. Ever.

24
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:42,411
And you were the only person
that I ever wanted to see again.

25
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:21,408
They found us. We gotta go.

26
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:14,336
- Skyhook, this is White Rabbit.
- Copy.

27
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,590
Change of plan. Can you get us
out of here 30 minutes early?

28
00:03:17,673 --> 00:03:19,341
Affirmative.

29
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:04,386
We are being pursued.
We won't make the meeting point.

30
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,930
We need extraction now!

31
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:09,475
We're locked onto your signal.
Prepare for extraction.

32
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:14,063
Have you in sight, turning,
final approach from the south.

33
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:15,564
Hostile, six o'clock.

34
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:18,400
Reverse course, 180 degrees,
for recovery in 10.

35
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:20,152
Noah, hold on!

36
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:23,531
Nine.

37
00:04:23,823 --> 00:04:26,033
- Drive for me.
- Eight.

38
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,036
Seven.

39
00:04:30,996 --> 00:04:32,081
Six.

40
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,042
Five.

41
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:39,171
- Four.
- I'm pulling the cord.

42
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:41,132
Three.

43
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:44,093
Two.

44
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,138
One.

45
00:04:47,596 --> 00:04:49,265
Hold on!

46
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:12,246
The CIA has a new lead on Khasinau.

47
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:16,792
K-Directorate is looking for revenge.
We received Intel last night.

48
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:20,212
They've hired a fairly prestigious
freelance assassin

49
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:22,923
to find Khasinau and dismember him.

50
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:26,469
- The Snowman. Familiar with him?
- The Snowman?

51
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:29,221
He's been on the CIA's
wanted list for 12 years.

52
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:32,308
Presumed dead since '97.
It seems we're not so lucky.

53
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:34,268
I'm looking for contacts.

54
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:38,189
Maybe we can find Khasinau
by following the Snowman.

55
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:42,443
I just... wanna make sure
you get to Khasinau first.

56
00:05:42,526 --> 00:05:47,114
- I know how important it is to you.
- Thank you.

57
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:56,415
Hey...

58
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:01,879
So the operation went alright
in Arkhangelsk with Noah?

59
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:06,967
Yeah.

60
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:09,011
Good.

61
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:52,638
- She's back tonight?
- She said so on the machine.

62
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:55,891
She's at San Francisco airport
waiting for a plane.

63
00:06:55,975 --> 00:06:59,145
- So, we gonna strategise this?
- Strategise? How?

64
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:02,481
I wanna be gentle with her.
We're accusing her of lying.

65
00:07:02,565 --> 00:07:05,359
I was thinking,
what if she wants us to ask her?

66
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:07,695
Like she wanted you
to find the ticket.

67
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:11,031
- Because it's a cry for help?
- I don't know. Maybe.

68
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:19,999
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

69
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:27,089
- So, how was San Francisco?
- Two days of due diligence.

70
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:31,010
If I never see another financial
statement, it'll be fine with me.

71
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:36,974
I'm gonna crash, if you don't mind.

72
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,225
- No.
- Course not.

73
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:40,519
OK. Hi.

74
00:07:40,603 --> 00:07:42,271
- Hi.
- Hey.

75
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:49,820
- You didn't say anything.
- That's why I wanted to strategise.

76
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,034
Syd, I'm not kidding.
I want you to go away with me.

77
00:07:55,117 --> 00:07:58,370
What happened the other night,

78
00:07:58,454 --> 00:07:59,622
it was too soon.

79
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:02,249
Russia has a huge
bootleg software industry.

80
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,503
I figured out a way of skimming money
off the Russian mob.

81
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:09,965
- What are you talking about?
- I got a lot of money hidden away.

82
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:11,717
Syd, I'm getting out.

83
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:14,053
I'm sick of lying to everyone I know.

84
00:08:14,136 --> 00:08:16,347
The idea of just walking away

85
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:21,477
from all these people that are meant
to be my best friends is a relief.

86
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,438
You tell me you never felt that way.

87
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,948
I've got someone helping me out.
I'm not kidding. I want you to come.

88
00:08:34,031 --> 00:08:37,284
I can't say where, but we won't need
locks on the doors.

89
00:08:37,368 --> 00:08:41,330
- And you will learn how to surf.
- You know I can't do that.

90
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,875
- Why?
- For about a million reasons.

91
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,336
I highly doubt that.
There might be 50.

92
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:50,422
I'd like the opportunity
to refute all of them.

93
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:54,301
One of the big reasons is my mother.

94
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:56,762
Khasinau was her superior.

95
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:59,432
My mother was a spy for the KGB.

96
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:03,269
Those files that we recovered
may help me find her.

97
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:06,105
I'm not going anywhere
until I know where she is.

98
00:09:06,188 --> 00:09:08,691
What if I wait? Will you ever do it?

99
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:19,034
We followed up
on Agent Noah Hicks.

100
00:09:33,883 --> 00:09:36,969
- Is Hicks here?
- Yes. He arrived 12 minutes ago.

101
00:09:37,052 --> 00:09:39,430
Tell McCullough I need to see him.

102
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,517
Don't let Hicks leave.

103
00:09:45,478 --> 00:09:48,022
- Dad?
- Sydney.

104
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:56,363
You said
you were gonna talk to someone.

105
00:09:56,447 --> 00:09:58,491
I did, thank you. I took care of it.

106
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:04,997
Marshall unlocked
Khasinau's computer core.

107
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,083
Your last operation,
I wouldn't have allowed it.

108
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:11,962
Those computers are used for
theoretical analyses, war games.

109
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:15,841
The recovered files bear no relevance
to his operation, his plans,

110
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:17,551
or his Rambaldi artifacts.

111
00:10:17,635 --> 00:10:20,513
Nor do they give any hint
to his whereabouts.

112
00:10:22,264 --> 00:10:26,936
But when I was there, I saw
there were some files on Mom.

113
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:32,775
I know. Also recovered on the core
were some unhelpful archival files.

114
00:10:32,858 --> 00:10:36,112
In the case of your mother...
video footage.

115
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,865
- Was she in the video?
- Yes.

116
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:42,952
After the accident?
They showed her alive?

117
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:46,956
Yes. I have no interest
in watching the video myself.

118
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,291
Analysis is reviewing it.

119
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,294
There's nothing
to help in the hunt for Khasinau.

120
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:54,922
The risk was all for nothing.

121
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:06,809
Hey, Dixon.

122
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:12,606
I keep trying to think
of some kind of opening line,

123
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,525
something to start off with.

124
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:15,860
To talk to you.

125
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:19,780
Noah, I'll be straight with you.
I don't trust you.

126
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:23,409
It wouldn't be a problem,
except I'm an intelligence officer.

127
00:11:23,492 --> 00:11:25,411
If you stay, sooner or later,

128
00:11:25,494 --> 00:11:29,415
my life is going to be in your hands
and yours in mine.

129
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:35,796
And in that scenario... the only
person truly safe will be you.

130
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:40,384
Mr Hicks,
would you come with us, please?

131
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:42,136
Is there a problem?

132
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:45,806
Mr Sloane asked for you
to come with us.

133
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:50,644
Well, that's never a good thing.
Excuse me.

134
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,989
On March 16th of this year,

135
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:05,326
you opened an account
with Banque Afrikana.

136
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:08,829
- Yes, sir.
- Explain.

137
00:12:08,913 --> 00:12:12,792
It was exactly like the account
we were just talking about.

138
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:16,837
It was opened up under an alias
as part of a SVR operation.

139
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:20,257
Mr McCullough,
I was working undercover.

140
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:24,011
I was required to do a whole bunch
of things which probably seem

141
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:26,972
very suspicious
when viewed from the outside.

142
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:34,814
$47 m was transferred,
then withdrawn within 24 hours.

143
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:40,111
- Yes.
- To an untraceable account.

144
00:12:40,736 --> 00:12:44,740
- Who was the recipient?
- I don't know.

145
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:50,704
You don't seem real thrilled
with these responses.

146
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:56,669
Have you ever conducted business
with the GL Bank of Austria?

147
00:12:57,545 --> 00:12:58,587
Yes.

148
00:12:58,671 --> 00:13:01,549
Please provide details.

149
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:07,471
This man is hiding something.
I'm curious to know what it is.

150
00:13:08,597 --> 00:13:10,933
Would you like me
to have a word with him?

151
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:18,274
My Russian or American name?

152
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:23,571
- Why not both?
- Irina Derevko and Laura Bristow.

153
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:27,199
When were you recruited
for special duties?

154
00:13:27,992 --> 00:13:32,830
In 1970, I was recruited to the
KGB by you, Alexander Khasinau.

155
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:36,876
Describe the objective
of your operation.

156
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:42,715
Phase One.
I was to pose as an American.

157
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:44,425
A student of literature.

158
00:13:44,508 --> 00:13:48,304
Phase Two. I was to make the
acquaintance of a particular officer

159
00:13:48,387 --> 00:13:51,182
in the Central Intelligence Agency.

160
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:54,977
To insinuate myself into his life.
To become his confidante.

161
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,062
Earn his trust.

162
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:05,446
- Please state the officer by name.
- Officer Jonathan Donohue Bristow.

163
00:14:06,238 --> 00:14:07,615
Phase Three?

164
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:10,868
I was to begin to acquire,
through various means,

165
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:15,372
details of the CIA operation
to which Bristow was assigned.

166
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:18,000
Project Christmas.

167
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:23,923
You have no reason to believe that
anyone else was suspicious of you?

168
00:14:40,064 --> 00:14:42,108
- I need you to feed Donovan.
- Who?

169
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:43,776
My dog, Donovan.

170
00:14:43,943 --> 00:14:46,529
Which key is...?
Where are you going?

171
00:14:46,612 --> 00:14:49,156
Top lock, bottom lock.
I'm going to Bogota.

172
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,952
Give him a can of the dog food
and half a can of the dried stuff.

173
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:55,162
- What's in Bogota?
- Only half a can.

174
00:14:55,246 --> 00:14:58,165
- It's next to the canned stuff.
- What's in Bogota.

175
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:02,336
Interpol says eight years ago
the Snowman attacked a guy, Kishell.

176
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:05,589
- Punctured heart, lung, lost an eye.
- I got it. It was bad.

177
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:08,259
This guy Kishell
worked with Snowman,

178
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:10,094
who we know is after
Khasinau.

179
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:12,847
We get Kishell, we get Snowman,
we get Khasinau.

180
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:16,684
Exactly. Half a can. I don't want
to come back to a fat dog.

181
00:15:18,144 --> 00:15:21,021
There were two men in Mom's video.

182
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:25,526
One was Khasinau.
The other one, I recognised him.

183
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:37,705
It was the man from the article.

184
00:15:37,788 --> 00:15:41,417
The FBI agent who supposedly died
in the accident with Mom.

185
00:15:42,126 --> 00:15:45,129
Caulder's real name
is Igor Sergei Valenco.

186
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:49,216
The man who was pursuing Mom.
The FBI spy hunter.

187
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,054
Dad, he was KGB. It wasn't
just Mom's death they faked.

188
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:55,681
It was Caulder's too.

189
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:58,642
If we can get to Caulder,
maybe we can find Khasinau.

190
00:15:58,726 --> 00:16:01,312
Assuming they still have ties.

191
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:04,857
Khasinau recently liquidated
over $200m in assets.

192
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,651
On that memo were initials. ISV.

193
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:11,322
Six months ago, a man matching
Caulder's description

194
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:15,576
was caught on camera entering
a financial office in Cape Town,

195
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:17,995
a known money-laundering operation.

196
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,750
I'll suggest to Sloane we go there,
seize their records and find Caulder.

197
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:26,128
Noah spent years undercover there.
He'll be an asset.

198
00:16:26,712 --> 00:16:31,967
SD-6 has run an additional profile
on Noah. There were anomalies.

199
00:16:32,051 --> 00:16:36,263
Recent bank activity suggests
he may have ties to K-Directorate.

200
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:39,016
Noah's been taken into custody.

201
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,063
What? I know what that's about.
It's not to do with another agency.

202
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:49,777
You have no perspective on who that
man is. You're as lost now as I was.

203
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,946
- You don't know him.
- Nor do you.

204
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:54,532
- That's the lesson in all this.
- Dad.

205
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:58,494
Noah Hicks... is not a perfect man.

206
00:16:59,203 --> 00:17:01,288
But he is also not a traitor.

207
00:17:01,372 --> 00:17:04,667
He's a loyal officer, who believes
he's working for the CIA.

208
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,962
He has no idea SD-6 would kill him

209
00:17:08,045 --> 00:17:11,006
if they thought
he was a double agent.

210
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,758
Please?

211
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:16,220
Dad, talk to Sloane.

212
00:17:35,281 --> 00:17:37,533
I never actually met the Snowman.

213
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:41,412
He always contacted me by telephone.

214
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:50,337
His name, the Snowman,
it comes from his method.

215
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:52,298
He prefers an ice pick.

216
00:17:52,882 --> 00:17:55,217
But he uses knives too.

217
00:17:55,301 --> 00:17:58,137
I arranged travel
across difficult borders.

218
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:04,852
It was my specialty. One operation,
he was ambushed, attacked.

219
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:07,396
He fought off and killed eight men.

220
00:18:08,314 --> 00:18:10,858
He thought that I tipped someone off.

221
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:13,819
That was when he came after me.

222
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:17,281
He came to this house.
He attacked me while I slept.

223
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:20,117
Killing is his job.

224
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:23,412
He likes his job.

225
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,751
I appreciate you talking to me.
I know this must be difficult.

226
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:33,047
I know difficult. Talk is easy.

227
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,051
I know the CIA
has spoken to you before, years ago.

228
00:18:37,134 --> 00:18:41,639
But we know that an organisation
has hired the Snowman for a job.

229
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:46,602
I read the transcripts. Last time
you said you had no leads.

230
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:49,021
I hoped, this time,
you might have some.

231
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:51,732
You have come too far to go home
with nothing.

232
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:59,698
For years I was afraid to do
anything. To seek revenge.

233
00:19:01,283 --> 00:19:03,953
But enough time has passed,
Mr Vaughn.

234
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,875
I have no more fear.

235
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:14,713
Yes, I have some leads.

236
00:19:14,797 --> 00:19:19,260
- You'd be willing to share them?
- I will contact them myself.

237
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:23,889
See if I can find out where the
Snowman is. What his plans are.

238
00:19:23,973 --> 00:19:25,766
I'd appreciate that.

239
00:19:28,644 --> 00:19:30,563
You must promise me one thing.

240
00:19:31,897 --> 00:19:36,777
That when you find him...
he will suffer too.

241
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:48,747
Come on, sweetheart, you're in pain.
He can get you a stronger...

242
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,793
OK. Yeah.

243
00:19:53,377 --> 00:20:00,176
Yeah. Just promise me that you'll
call me after you talk to him. OK?

244
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:03,804
Good. OK. Me, too.

245
00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:05,347
Bye.

246
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:12,521
- I need a minute.
- Yep.

247
00:20:13,189 --> 00:20:14,774
This is about Noah Hicks.

248
00:20:14,857 --> 00:20:17,067
There's something
he's not telling us.

249
00:20:18,694 --> 00:20:20,738
He might have been turned.

250
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:24,867
If you have Hicks killed,
you'd be throwing away an asset.

251
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,328
- How so?
- You want Khasinau.

252
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:29,205
You're closer than you think.

253
00:20:29,288 --> 00:20:34,084
Were you aware Caulder, FBI, was
working with the KGB since 1973?

254
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,214
Sydney's designed an operation
to lead us to Caulder.

255
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:41,008
We'll be one step away
from Khasinau.

256
00:20:43,636 --> 00:20:49,558
And she wants Mr Hicks involved?
This is becoming familiar, Jack.

257
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:52,686
Your coming to me,

258
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:56,482
requesting special consideration
for the men in Sydney's life.

259
00:20:56,565 --> 00:20:59,276
Tippin didn't turn out to be
a problem, did he?

260
00:21:01,153 --> 00:21:04,073
Sydney wasn't intimate with Tippin.

261
00:21:06,617 --> 00:21:07,952
She is with Hicks.

262
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,875
I'm not sure that's my business.
And I know it isn't yours.

263
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,880
Sloane accepted
the mission I proposed.

264
00:22:42,963 --> 00:22:45,049
Noah and I are going to Cape Town.

265
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:48,135
Caulder's done business
at a financial office there.

266
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:51,138
We're gonna break into that office,
get the records

267
00:22:51,222 --> 00:22:54,308
and hopefully find out
where Caulder is.

268
00:22:54,391 --> 00:22:56,477
What's my counter-mission?

269
00:22:57,645 --> 00:22:58,979
There shouldn't be one.

270
00:22:59,063 --> 00:23:01,774
When you knew he was KGB,
you should have told me.

271
00:23:01,857 --> 00:23:06,153
- Did you think I wasn't thinking?
- I don't know what you thought!

272
00:23:06,237 --> 00:23:09,615
I was thinking about the 36 hours
the FBI kept me in chains.

273
00:23:09,698 --> 00:23:11,867
If I'd given the information to you,

274
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:15,204
you would be required
to forward it to the FBI.

275
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:16,956
We both know what they'd do.

276
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,541
- Classify it.
- Omega 17.

277
00:23:18,624 --> 00:23:21,502
We wouldn't be allowed
near that investigation.

278
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:25,881
I'm supposed to give you this.

279
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:30,970
Tell you to write down whatever
information you recover from Caulder.

280
00:23:31,053 --> 00:23:35,182
Stick it in the chamber, activate the
beacon, bin it and we'll retrieve it.

281
00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:37,768
But I'm guessing you won't use it.

282
00:23:37,852 --> 00:23:41,105
Vaughn, I promise you
Khasinau will not walk.

283
00:23:41,188 --> 00:23:43,274
And I won't let
SD-6 get to him first.

284
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:46,819
But I refuse to let the FBI
get in my way again.

285
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,547
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

286
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:10,551
It's easy to shoot tranqs.
No anxiety of killing somebody.

287
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,432
The server room floor is alarmed
with motion detectors.

288
00:24:16,515 --> 00:24:18,434
So we stay off the floor.

289
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:23,397
It also has audio sensors that can
detect any sound above.05 dB's.

290
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:25,316
In other words...

291
00:24:26,358 --> 00:24:29,403
This right here, two dB's.

292
00:24:29,487 --> 00:24:33,741
.05 dB's is closer to the sound of a
cockroach rubbing its legs together.

293
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,955
- OK, so what do we do?
- Well, active noise control.

294
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:44,460
It emits an out-of-phase signal that
cancels out any sound within 200ft.

295
00:24:44,543 --> 00:24:46,212
Check it out.

296
00:24:46,837 --> 00:24:50,299
That is pretty loud, right? And...

297
00:26:40,618 --> 00:26:43,329
The server case is alarmed.
Don't touch it.

298
00:26:43,412 --> 00:26:46,791
You want to get a wireless
modem within 3" of the server.

299
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:55,508
You'll hack into the server,

300
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:59,345
then download the data
into your laptop. Am I boring you?

301
00:28:26,015 --> 00:28:29,643
You have no reason to believe
anyone became suspicious of you?

302
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,522
Of course, I would have told you.

303
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:38,068
How did you acquire your Intel?

304
00:28:39,236 --> 00:28:42,907
Every night, for 10 years,
I went through his briefcase.

305
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,910
I eavesdropped on all
of his private conversations.

306
00:28:45,993 --> 00:28:48,913
I planted listening devices
on his clothing.

307
00:28:50,122 --> 00:28:54,335
He was blinded by his emotions.
He knew nothing.

308
00:28:54,418 --> 00:29:00,591
I can tell you one thing.
Jack Bristow was a fool.

309
00:29:24,406 --> 00:29:26,951
- Dr Barnett.
- Mr Bristow.

310
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:29,120
Yes. I was...

311
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:33,040
I was wondering if you might have
some time this afternoon.

312
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:36,085
I'll make some time.

313
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:48,848
- I didn't pick that play.
- No, the computer picked it for you.

314
00:29:48,931 --> 00:29:52,017
- But I don't... Reset it.
- Touchdown.

315
00:29:52,101 --> 00:29:54,562
- You cheated. Dude!
- Score!

316
00:29:54,645 --> 00:29:55,688
Hey, guys.

317
00:29:57,064 --> 00:30:00,985
- Hey.
- What's going on?

318
00:30:04,738 --> 00:30:09,160
Why are you looking at me like that?
Did you break something of mine?

319
00:30:09,994 --> 00:30:11,829
No. It's...

320
00:30:12,997 --> 00:30:17,001
I found this in the pocket
of your jacket I borrowed last week.

321
00:30:19,044 --> 00:30:20,713
You said you were in Seattle.

322
00:30:23,507 --> 00:30:26,469
You can tell us
it's none of our business.

323
00:30:26,552 --> 00:30:31,724
But... we just care about you,
that's all.

324
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,730
- This is serious.
- Yeah.

325
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:48,282
OK. I've signed a dozen
non-disclosure agreements,

326
00:30:48,365 --> 00:30:51,035
so this is between us.

327
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:52,787
Of course.

328
00:30:54,914 --> 00:30:58,542
Six months ago
my job at the bank changed.

329
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:02,171
We have a handful of clients,
most of them are international,

330
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:05,800
who don't want their business
to go through the postal service.

331
00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:07,927
They don't want a paper trail.

332
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:12,556
So I fly to them,
as the bank's representative.

333
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:18,979
I'm so sorry I had to keep this
from you guys. I just had no choice.

334
00:31:20,397 --> 00:31:21,899
Is that legal?

335
00:31:22,691 --> 00:31:27,655
Yeah, it's totally legit.
It's just... It's a secret.

336
00:31:31,951 --> 00:31:34,829
- Francie thought it was an affair.
- No, I didn't!

337
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:39,458
- Yes, you did.
- I said if you were, I would know.

338
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:42,211
Well, this is all there is.

339
00:31:42,294 --> 00:31:46,298
So I am gonna go change,

340
00:31:46,382 --> 00:31:49,552
and then I'm gonna kick your ass
in that game.

341
00:31:49,635 --> 00:31:54,765
Oh, bring it on, seriously. I am so
bored playing Francie, it's...

342
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,428
- Hey, Marshall.
- Hey, Miss Bristow.

343
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:35,139
Anything yet?
Any word on where Caulder is?

344
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:38,934
Mr Sloane didn't tell you?

345
00:32:39,852 --> 00:32:43,439
There was no data recovered
from Noah's laptop.

346
00:32:43,522 --> 00:32:46,942
That server room must have had
some sort of EMF generator.

347
00:32:47,026 --> 00:32:49,445
So, basically, when you ran out

348
00:32:49,528 --> 00:32:53,407
your laptop got pulsed
and it erased everything.

349
00:32:53,491 --> 00:32:55,367
- Hey.
- Hi.

350
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:02,082
- You heard about the computers?
- Yes.

351
00:33:05,503 --> 00:33:09,715
Syd, if your mom is out there,
you will find her. It's gonna happen.

352
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:15,596
I just feel like I'm at a dead end.
How's the arm?

353
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,517
It feels great.
The lidocaine hasn't worn off.

354
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,686
26 stitches. New personal record.

355
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,190
- Hello, Sydney.
- Hello.

356
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:31,153
I was disappointed by the news,
but we'll pick up Caulder's trail.

357
00:33:31,987 --> 00:33:35,449
Noah, your flight to Baku
leaves at six.

358
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:37,993
In two weeks, you enter
a doctoral programme

359
00:33:38,077 --> 00:33:41,789
on Petrol Geoscience
at Khezar University.

360
00:33:41,872 --> 00:33:45,251
Inside this folder is information
on dead drop procedure.

361
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:51,924
See ID Services for your passport
and travel visas. Good luck, Noah.

362
00:33:53,217 --> 00:33:55,886
Noah just got home
from a five-year assignment.

363
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,638
He's been home for two weeks.

364
00:33:57,721 --> 00:34:00,641
Do you think it's wise
to send him under again so soon?

365
00:34:02,768 --> 00:34:04,645
I volunteered.

366
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:10,276
Thank you.

367
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:15,781
- You're not going to Baku, are you?
- No. Tuvalu.

368
00:34:15,865 --> 00:34:18,242
It's an island in the South Pacific.

369
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:25,291
I talked to my contact.
He says now is my window.

370
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:28,711
I'm leaving tonight.

371
00:34:30,671 --> 00:34:32,381
We could go together.

372
00:34:36,385 --> 00:34:39,096
Sometimes
all I wanna do is disappear.

373
00:34:41,265 --> 00:34:45,436
Just let all of this go.
Just... start over again.

374
00:34:50,065 --> 00:34:53,027
But I have my personal reasons
for staying.

375
00:34:56,363 --> 00:35:00,743
Syd, this life is not worth it
and you know it.

376
00:35:00,826 --> 00:35:02,411
There's too many secrets.

377
00:35:02,495 --> 00:35:05,873
- Too much lying to everybody...
- I know.

378
00:35:05,956 --> 00:35:08,000
Then come with me.

379
00:35:13,506 --> 00:35:15,341
This is what we're gonna do.

380
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,886
I booked you on a flight
for tomorrow night.

381
00:35:19,428 --> 00:35:23,557
Come with me for one week
to Tuvalu. Let me prove it can work.

382
00:35:27,728 --> 00:35:30,523
If it's about your mother,
you and I can find her.

383
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:34,443
We don't need the CIA for that.
It'll be our last mission.

384
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:40,616
And after that, we start completely
new. Can you imagine that?

385
00:35:43,702 --> 00:35:48,791
Be on that plane and give me
one week. Just one week.

386
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:05,516
One week.

387
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:21,907
Mr Sloane!

388
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:25,786
I've been impressed with myself
in the past. Now I'm freaking out.

389
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,121
- Just tell me.
- Yes.

390
00:36:27,204 --> 00:36:32,126
I used a signal-lost recovery
procedure to examine the data sector.

391
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:36,630
- I created a raw image of...
- Marshall, what did you do?

392
00:36:38,758 --> 00:36:39,967
I found Valenco.

393
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:44,930
I mean Caulder. Well, it's the
same guy, right? Well, I found him.

394
00:36:48,058 --> 00:36:52,938
Marshall has reconstructed the data
you downloaded in Cape Town.

395
00:36:53,022 --> 00:36:56,484
The routing information
directed us to Mackay, Australia,

396
00:36:56,567 --> 00:36:58,986
and Bently Caulder's
private residence.

397
00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:02,531
This one is straightforward.
A daylight snatch operation.

398
00:37:02,615 --> 00:37:06,827
You'll lead a recovery team,
grab Caulder, bring him here.

399
00:37:06,911 --> 00:37:10,956
The plane leaves in two hours.
Dixon, could you give us a minute?

400
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,130
Sydney, I told you
I'd get you closer to your mother.

401
00:37:20,049 --> 00:37:24,303
I'm always here for you.
You know that.

402
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:28,557
Thanks.

403
00:37:55,042 --> 00:37:57,128
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

404
00:37:57,211 --> 00:38:00,923
I am 35,000ft over the Pacific,

405
00:38:01,006 --> 00:38:05,094
and you just missed the most
beautiful sunset I've ever seen.

406
00:38:05,177 --> 00:38:06,929
Hi.

407
00:38:08,347 --> 00:38:12,309
You're coming, right? Tell me
that you are coming to meet me.

408
00:38:12,393 --> 00:38:15,980
- Noah.
- Come on.

409
00:38:16,689 --> 00:38:19,733
If things were different...

410
00:38:22,111 --> 00:38:23,988
Any word on Caulder?

411
00:38:26,115 --> 00:38:27,783
No.

412
00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:29,952
It was great to see you...

413
00:38:30,035 --> 00:38:35,040
Syd, whatever you're about to say,
it's not goodbye.

414
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,418
- OK?
- OK.

415
00:38:37,501 --> 00:38:41,213
- Alright, I'll see ya.
- I'll see you, too.

416
00:38:51,515 --> 00:38:55,144
- OK, I believe this isn't goodbye.
- Joey's Pizza?

417
00:38:59,315 --> 00:39:01,192
Wrong number.

418
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:05,112
Devlin knows
you're going to Australia.

419
00:39:05,196 --> 00:39:08,073
You understand
he'll be expecting a full report?

420
00:39:09,575 --> 00:39:11,452
Yeah.

421
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:15,456
I know how important is it for you
to find your mom. I'll help if I can.

422
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:17,208
Thanks.

423
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:20,836
Any word on the Snowman?

424
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,215
That guy I met in Bogota,
I'm waiting for him to call me back.

425
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:28,260
You wanna tell me what's going on?

426
00:39:38,813 --> 00:39:40,815
Sydney, you can talk to me.

427
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:44,735
Off the record.

428
00:39:47,321 --> 00:39:48,781
I'm alright.

429
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:04,463
Wait until I open the gate
before you come in.

430
00:40:04,547 --> 00:40:07,758
B-team have the perimeter
in case Caulder tries to run.

431
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,063
This is Vaughn.

432
00:40:21,147 --> 00:40:24,942
Mr Vaughn,
I have spoken to my friends.

433
00:40:25,025 --> 00:40:28,195
I have some information for you.

434
00:40:29,447 --> 00:40:31,574
- Dixon.
- Are you at the junction box?

435
00:40:31,657 --> 00:40:35,077
No, not yet. This is weird.
I don't see any guards.

436
00:41:00,936 --> 00:41:03,856
Weiss. The Snowman,
he's been spotted in Mackay.

437
00:41:03,939 --> 00:41:07,026
Sydney's there. He's after Caulder
to get to Khasinau.

438
00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:09,737
Can you think of a way to warn her?

439
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,281
- We don't have her on comm?
- No.

440
00:41:12,364 --> 00:41:15,534
Dixon, I just saw three guards.
They're dead.

441
00:41:16,744 --> 00:41:18,204
Dixon!

442
00:41:29,215 --> 00:41:31,258
No! Caulder!

443
00:43:25,206 --> 00:43:27,291
I tried to keep you from this.

444
00:43:30,669 --> 00:43:32,338
You know that.

445
00:43:48,354 --> 00:43:49,605
Sydney!
