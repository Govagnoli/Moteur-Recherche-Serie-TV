1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:02,046
<i>Previously on "Alias."</i>

2
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:04,211
Hands behind your head.

3
00:00:06,598 --> 00:00:09,468
Lauren, please, don't do this.

4
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,854
God, what are you doing?

5
00:00:18,943 --> 00:00:20,983
Give me the gun, Lauren.

6
00:00:25,116 --> 00:00:28,283
Sark said you might back out.

7
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:33,409
Did the forensics check out?

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,662
Yes.

9
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:37,503
The official cause
of death was suicide.

10
00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:39,496
Do you accept that?

11
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:41,665
At this point I have
no reason not to.

12
00:00:41,758 --> 00:00:43,585
In going through
the senator's effects,

13
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:46,084
we discovered evidence
that for the past year,

14
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:49,548
he has been consulting with you
regarding Rambaldi's work.

15
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:51,966
As a result,
we have been given authority

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,263
to officially revoke
your pardon agreement.

17
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:59,269
In two weeks, you'll be executed
by lethal injection.

18
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,611
The box you lost
has not been opened

19
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,984
since the time of Rambaldi.

20
00:01:05,073 --> 00:01:07,279
It was rumoured
to contain the strain

21
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,866
of a plague-like bioweapon
capable of killing millions.

22
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:12,496
This bioweapon.

23
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,743
What do you know about it?

24
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:18,540
Only that The Covenant
refers to it as The Passenger.

25
00:01:25,927 --> 00:01:29,047
I placed something powerful
in that box.

26
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,968
And now The Covenant has it,
and that terrifies me.

27
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:38,221
I secured that box
so it could be opened

28
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:41,849
by keys that Rambaldi himself
had hidden.

29
00:01:43,194 --> 00:01:46,029
Bomani and Sark found the keys.

30
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:54,742
Which means they have the heart.

31
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,868
The Di Regno heart
is an engine designed

32
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:03,828
to power Rambaldi's
ultimate creation.

33
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:06,007
Il Dire.

34
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:09,295
Which means "The Telling."

35
00:02:11,556 --> 00:02:15,684
What they will witness is
nothing short of a resurrection.

36
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:23,976
As if Rambaldi is reaching
through the centuries

37
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:26,227
to deliver a message.

38
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,415
He's speaking.

39
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:51,174
The Covenant is after
The Passenger.

40
00:02:51,262 --> 00:02:54,466
How will Il Dire
help them obtain it?

41
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:58,557
If I help, will you
stay my execution?

42
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,139
No.

43
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,637
I will not.

44
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,939
We're done here.

45
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:13,281
I'll talk to Jack Bristow
about The Passenger.

46
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:21,823
There will be no deal.

47
00:03:23,795 --> 00:03:26,831
You make that quite clear.

48
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,975
There's been some cyber attack.
Dixon's ready to brief us.

49
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,193
You know, Syd,
no one would blame you

50
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:53,606
if you hated him
for going back to her.

51
00:03:54,242 --> 00:03:56,567
He's not the one I hate.

52
00:03:56,661 --> 00:03:57,942
How horrible does that sound?

53
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,575
I'm mad at her, and I don't
even think he's cute.

54
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:03,239
But it's not just about
them being together.

55
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:06,501
My dad thinks Lauren's leaking
information to The Covenant.

56
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:09,257
Didn't Senator Reed
confess to being the leak?

57
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,092
Yes, and his confessions
answered the questions

58
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:15,628
my father had raised,
but I can't help it.

59
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:16,836
I still have doubts.

60
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:18,556
Let me just ask you a question.

61
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:22,770
Do you think she's the mole, or
do you want her to be the mole?

62
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,730
12 hours ago,

63
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:32,733
a large-scale cyber-terrorist
attack was launched.

64
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:36,982
This computer virus originated
from a server in Berlin,

65
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,947
infecting servers
throughout Europe and Asia.

66
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:42,410
It's estimated
that within 24 hours,

67
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:45,120
it will consume over half
of all Internet bandwidth.

68
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,498
This particular worm targets
medical facilities,

69
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,160
universities,
laboratories, hospitals.

70
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,878
To date, 20 terabytes
of patient medical records

71
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:54,925
and databases
have been corrupted.

72
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:57,004
We believe The Covenant
is behind this?

73
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,089
We know The Passenger
is a bioweapon.

74
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:01,554
Given the targets,
we're assuming The Covenant

75
00:05:01,643 --> 00:05:02,971
is launching a precursor attack.

76
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:05,682
Maybe they're trying to shut
down the treatment facilities.

77
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,014
Weaken medical response
capabilities.

78
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,981
Are these our only leads?

79
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:11,266
Actually, no.

80
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:14,777
This code has all the trademarks
of a hacker known as Cypher.

81
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:17,153
Guess what.
He operates out of Berlin.

82
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:19,911
Vaughn, Sydney,
go to Berlin and identify him.

83
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:23,909
Confirm he created the worm, and
find out how we shut it down.

84
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:26,916
See Marshall for your op-tech.
You leave in two hours.

85
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,247
Okay, hackers
are a paranoid bunch.

86
00:05:34,342 --> 00:05:36,134
The one we want
is known as Cypher.

87
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:39,054
He's kind of a celebrity
in the on-line community.

88
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,630
But in the real world,
it's like he doesn't exist.

89
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:46,268
Don't worry, 'cause, lucky
for you, I kind of have a name

90
00:05:46,354 --> 00:05:49,059
in the hacker community myself.

91
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,141
Black Kitty.

92
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:56,272
Anyway, I was able to penetrate
Cypher's network

93
00:05:56,364 --> 00:05:58,238
and track him down
to an IRC chat.

94
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,531
Tomorrow night,
he'll be at a club in Berlin.

95
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:01,994
How do we identify him?

96
00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:05,115
Well, that's where these
come in.

97
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:08,622
Now, not only are they
a freshy-fresh pair of glasses.

98
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,667
Hello.

99
00:06:10,754 --> 00:06:13,423
They're also a wireless sniffer.

100
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,878
Cypher uses a digital system
with a unique code.

101
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:18,256
I've programmed the sniffer
to seek it out.

102
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:21,511
Now, all you have to do is
press this button right here,

103
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:24,515
and it will hack into his
computer and send him a message.

104
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:25,929
Pretty cool.

105
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,561
Are we sure he'll have
his computer?

106
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:31,643
Does a cowboy leave his gun at
home when he goes to the saloon?

107
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,606
Alright, trust me.

108
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:35,773
He'll have it.

109
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:46,366
How long before we match
the sequence from Il Dire?

110
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:49,457
The worm has reached
Latin America.

111
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,543
By this time tomorrow,
the database will be complete,

112
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:55,167
and we should have
a perfect match.

113
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,672
I received a call
from my associate.

114
00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:04,510
By associate, I assume
you mean Miss Reed.

115
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:06,600
Yes.

116
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:10,763
It seems the CIA is more
industrious than we'd assumed.

117
00:07:10,855 --> 00:07:13,975
They've discovered the identity
of our hacker friend.

118
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:17,057
She's taking care of him.

119
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:20,813
This girl.

120
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:25,284
Her work for us of late
has been uneven.

121
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:27,995
Il Dire is in our possession

122
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:31,035
because she managed
to steal it from the CIA.

123
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:33,699
She is a considerable asset.

124
00:07:33,795 --> 00:07:37,745
An asset for you in ways
that do not interest me.

125
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:41,423
I will stake my reputation
on her abilities.

126
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:44,002
And I will hold you
to your word.

127
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,971
But understand...

128
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:50,933
if you are mistaken, you both
will endure the consequences.

129
00:07:59,654 --> 00:08:00,983
I could go with you.

130
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:02,353
You're going to Berlin.

131
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,533
They can send someone else.
You shouldn't do this alone.

132
00:08:06,244 --> 00:08:08,569
I won't be alone.
Mom will be there.

133
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:09,944
My father's will made it clear

134
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:13,243
he wants his ashes
scattered in Dover.

135
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:15,116
The last thing I need

136
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:17,537
is another person close to me
letting the CIA down.

137
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,710
No one's judging you.

138
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,123
You see the way they look at me.

139
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:23,673
Like I'm a traitor, too.

140
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:27,171
To tell you the truth,
I don't blame them.

141
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:30,345
People are just angry.

142
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:32,095
And I'm not?

143
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:34,685
He was my father.

144
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:38,733
You have no idea what it's like
to know someone, love them,

145
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,903
and then figure out
it was nothing but lies.

146
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:45,694
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:34,574
Getting anything?

148
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,745
Not yet.

149
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:47,506
That's him.

150
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,491
Nice trick.

151
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,203
I'll have to readjust
my firewall settings.

152
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:20,499
I could still get through.

153
00:10:20,962 --> 00:10:22,622
I don't believe we've met.

154
00:10:22,714 --> 00:10:24,753
We're big fans of your work.

155
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:27,002
Perhaps you've heard
of our work.

156
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,382
The DDOS attack on the Syrian
government's network.

157
00:10:29,471 --> 00:10:31,712
Shut them down for a week.

158
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:32,969
That was you?

159
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:39,269
Nothing compared to what
you've got going on.

160
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,689
Clever coding.

161
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,864
That worm's going to be
circulating for months.

162
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,572
I think you have me
confused with someone else.

163
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,783
I didn't design that worm.

164
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:02,209
And even if I did,
you could never prove it.

165
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,039
So if you'll excuse me.

166
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,456
Sit down.
We're CIA.

167
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,131
I know you people
get your power trips

168
00:11:14,224 --> 00:11:17,343
by designing viruses,
breaking into systems.

169
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:18,894
But you have designed a worm

170
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,304
that is helping
a terrorist organisation

171
00:11:21,398 --> 00:11:24,233
Iaunch a biological weapon.

172
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:28,023
Once your employers complete
what they've set out to do,

173
00:11:28,113 --> 00:11:30,734
you will be guilty of murdering
thousands of people.

174
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:31,855
He didn't tell me.

175
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,780
Who's he?

176
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:35,654
He didn't give a name.
He was young, British.

177
00:11:35,745 --> 00:11:38,236
Why is the worm attacking
medical facilities?

178
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:40,195
That was not its function.

179
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,913
They asked me to engineer
a worm that was capable of...

180
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:50,629
I'm going after the shooter.

181
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:22,412
Sorry.

182
00:13:13,051 --> 00:13:14,426
We have a problem.

183
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:17,796
He had the files with him.
He gave them to the CIA.

184
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:21,092
If they have the source code,
they can stop the worm.

185
00:13:21,184 --> 00:13:22,464
We will lose everything.

186
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,514
There's time, if I corrupt the
files before they make a copy.

187
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,265
That's an extreme risk.

188
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:29,812
Letting Bomani know
I failed isn't?

189
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,644
You'll hear from me soon.

190
00:13:37,992 --> 00:13:41,860
Dixon has given me clearance
to talk about one thing only.

191
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,413
The Passenger.

192
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:46,452
I've told you everything
I know about The Passenger.

193
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:50,042
I used that as a pretext so
Dixon would allow time with you.

194
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,921
This is not a time for games.

195
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:53,169
This is no game, Jack.

196
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:55,416
This is my life.

197
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,212
The CIA wants me executed
next week

198
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,593
because they believe
I was working with Senator Reed.

199
00:14:00,682 --> 00:14:02,057
I was.

200
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:03,850
My association with Senator Reed

201
00:14:03,935 --> 00:14:06,971
had nothing to do with advancing
The Covenant's agenda.

202
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:09,646
Two years ago,
Senator Reed recruited me

203
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:12,983
to work for an organisation
inside the U.S. government.

204
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:16,772
They refer to themselves
as The Trust.

205
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:20,316
He indicated he was interested
in my knowledge of Rambaldi.

206
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,655
He made me an offer.

207
00:14:21,745 --> 00:14:25,327
If I was to agree to work with
him, he would secure my pardon.

208
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:27,621
And from that time on,

209
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:30,247
I did nothing but live up
to my part of the bargain.

210
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,747
I've never heard of The Trust.

211
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,709
The senator was my only contact.

212
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,922
Why haven't
they come to your aid?

213
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,002
I don't know.

214
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:43,092
Maybe they were fearful
of revealing themselves.

215
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,934
Or it could be that
I outlived my usefulness.

216
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,592
But you ask yourself, Jack.

217
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,681
Have I been helpful this year?

218
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:54,772
Tell me, have I
lived up to my word?

219
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,940
I helped Sydney recover
her memory.

220
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,984
I took a bullet for you,
for God's sake.

221
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,740
Well, now I need something
in return.

222
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:11,043
I need you to prove
that this group exists.

223
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:14,708
I was serving my country, Jack.

224
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:17,421
Not betraying it.

225
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:30,636
I'm connecting
the flash drive Cypher gave us.

226
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,352
Let's hope all his files
are here.

227
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:35,066
Cypher's dead.

228
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:36,860
It was the hospital.

229
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:38,984
He didn't make it
through surgery.

230
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:45,653
Vaughn, I think I saw Lauren.

231
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:46,326
What?

232
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,489
In the club after the shooting.

233
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,788
The Covenant knew
we were after Cypher.

234
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,413
What are you saying?
Lauren is Covenant?

235
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:54,452
I can't be sure.

236
00:15:54,546 --> 00:15:57,001
The shooter was wearing a wig.
It was dark.

237
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,423
Lauren's father was the one
passing intel to The Covenant.

238
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,506
He killed himself.

239
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,468
Don't you think
it's convenient he died

240
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:05,594
taking the blame
for the leaks with him?

241
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:07,556
Are you suggesting
Lauren framed her father?

242
00:16:07,642 --> 00:16:09,516
I know it's hard
for you to consider.

243
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,936
For me? My wife just found out
her father was betraying her.

244
00:16:13,022 --> 00:16:15,858
- But if I saw her.
- You didn't.

245
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:22,978
Lauren and her mother are
in England burying her father.

246
00:16:26,411 --> 00:16:29,032
I know things haven't worked out
the way we'd hoped.

247
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,664
You think that's
why I'm bringing this up?

248
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:33,074
Honestly, I don't know
what to think.

249
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:48,346
Dixon told me
I might find you here.

250
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:50,805
I had to see you.

251
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,108
I thought I hated him,
but when Mom and I got there.

252
00:16:58,193 --> 00:17:00,269
Those cliffs.

253
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:03,861
I don't know how many times
Dad and I took walks there.

254
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,318
In the States
he was never around,

255
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,735
but in England it was different.

256
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,751
Being there,
remembering him that way,

257
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,164
he didn't feel like a traitor.

258
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:18,913
He was just my father.

259
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:27,006
While we were there,
Mom gave me this.

260
00:17:27,472 --> 00:17:30,141
Dad had given it to her
when I was born.

261
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:32,717
She thought I might like
to have it.

262
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,147
It's gonna be okay.

263
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:44,604
Hello?

264
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:47,023
Hello, Mrs. Reed.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

265
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:50,117
This is Kathleen
from Director Pembroke's office.

266
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:53,868
I have the director holding on
a secure line for Lauren Reed.

267
00:17:53,957 --> 00:17:56,744
I was told she could be
reached at this number.

268
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:58,163
No, Miss Reed's not here.

269
00:17:58,253 --> 00:18:00,292
She's in Berlin.

270
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,460
I'm sorry. I didn't realise
she was leaving London so soon.

271
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:09,048
If you don't mind my asking,
when did she leave for Berlin?

272
00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:11,464
She left here
just a few hours ago.

273
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,634
Would you like me
to give her a message?

274
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:14,841
No message.

275
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:16,644
Thank you.

276
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,536
It's been a long time, Jack.

277
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,668
I need information
regarding a covert committee

278
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,133
within the U.S. government.

279
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:47,842
It's called The Trust.

280
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:51,593
If there were a group, where
would appropriations come from?

281
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:54,682
Intelligence budgets
are classified.

282
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:57,768
What makes you assume
it's Intelligence?

283
00:18:58,646 --> 00:19:01,564
I need evidence
this group exists.

284
00:19:03,985 --> 00:19:06,274
These people are powerful, Jack.

285
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:08,854
Enquiring about them
will put me at risk.

286
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,407
Why should I do that?

287
00:19:10,492 --> 00:19:13,695
Because then I will be
in your debt.

288
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:18,238
I'm sure you remember
how useful that can be.

289
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:30,381
Marshall's standing by.

290
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,803
As soon as we copy the memory,
we'll uplink it to him.

291
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,847
How far along are we?

292
00:19:36,851 --> 00:19:38,511
Almost a quarter of the way.

293
00:19:53,243 --> 00:19:54,867
Here you go.

294
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,491
Michael says you've been
awake all night.

295
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:04,206
I'm good, thanks.

296
00:20:04,295 --> 00:20:06,087
Maybe later then.

297
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:08,755
I've got some pretty bad news.

298
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:11,670
The memory on Cypher's
flash drive was wiped.

299
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:15,841
I think it was exposed
to a strong magnetic field.

300
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:17,095
How is that possible?

301
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,509
Seeing that we haven't had
any solar flare activity

302
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:21,013
within the past 24 hours,

303
00:20:21,104 --> 00:20:23,393
I'd have to say
it was done intentionally.

304
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:26,352
Could Cypher have corrupted the
data before he handed it to us?

305
00:20:26,443 --> 00:20:28,482
It's possible
he had a fail-safe,

306
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,194
but I haven't found
any evidence.

307
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,560
We've lost everything?

308
00:20:31,656 --> 00:20:33,613
Not everything, thanks to me.

309
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,731
And electron microscopy.

310
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:37,068
I've been able to partially
reconstruct his files,

311
00:20:37,162 --> 00:20:39,238
including the worm's
source code.

312
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,279
You guys ready?

313
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:43,042
That thing isn't purposely
destroying data.

314
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:44,324
That's a side effect.

315
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:46,043
It's collecting information.

316
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:48,881
It's what's called
an intelligence-gathering worm.

317
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:52,049
The Covenant
are looking for something.

318
00:20:52,135 --> 00:20:52,669
What?

319
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:54,385
I haven't figured that out,

320
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:56,380
but I've tweaked
the worm's source code

321
00:20:56,473 --> 00:20:57,552
so it won't destroy more data.

322
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,424
All the data it is collecting
is being rerouted to our server.

323
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,599
Whatever The Covenant's looking
for, we're going to get it now.

324
00:21:08,276 --> 00:21:10,399
CIA cut the feed?

325
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:12,563
I'm trying to get it back.

326
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:16,991
Tell me why I shouldn't
snap your neck right now.

327
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:19,116
In case it escaped your memory,

328
00:21:19,204 --> 00:21:22,869
I secured your release
from that Siberian prison.

329
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:27,627
This work is as important to me
as it is to you.

330
00:21:27,712 --> 00:21:30,713
No one will jeopardise that.

331
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,503
I clearly overestimated
Miss Reed's abilities.

332
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:35,253
A little too late for that.

333
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:36,127
Yes.

334
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:38,379
But she's still on the inside.

335
00:21:38,473 --> 00:21:40,715
I will make sure she re-acquires
the information

336
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:43,050
the CIA stole from us.

337
00:21:43,144 --> 00:21:47,308
Once she passes it along,
she will be eliminated.

338
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:50,602
See we get that information
as soon as possible then.

339
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:57,324
This cannot be a coincidence.

340
00:21:57,409 --> 00:21:59,781
Do you believe Lauren
would corrupt the files

341
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:01,411
with you and Vaughn watching?

342
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:03,952
If she were
desperate enough, yes.

343
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,282
Dad, if Lauren really is
The Covenant mole,

344
00:22:06,376 --> 00:22:09,412
if she did assassinate Cypher,
she could never have anticipated

345
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:13,003
he'd have the code on him,
let alone give it to us.

346
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:14,502
And what about Vaughn?

347
00:22:14,592 --> 00:22:17,593
I've tried talking to him. He
won't entertain the possibility.

348
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,384
It's like he can't hear it.

349
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,300
Perhaps he can't hear it
from you.

350
00:22:41,953 --> 00:22:43,661
Sydney spoke to you.

351
00:22:45,582 --> 00:22:47,824
All I ask
is that you hear me out.

352
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:53,504
My marriage with Irina,
in spite of everything,

353
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,626
was a happy time for me.

354
00:22:56,718 --> 00:22:58,509
It was easy being with her.

355
00:22:58,595 --> 00:23:04,882
But there were times, moments,
when I became curious.

356
00:23:04,976 --> 00:23:07,265
How had she occupied
her morning?

357
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:10,307
What were her plans
while I was out of town?

358
00:23:12,317 --> 00:23:16,528
Usually she told me,
but occasionally she'd stop

359
00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:21,156
what she was doing,
walk over, and offer me a kiss.

360
00:23:21,242 --> 00:23:23,864
A spontaneous gesture.

361
00:23:25,163 --> 00:23:28,199
But on one occasion
it struck me.

362
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,294
This impulsive kiss.

363
00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:34,829
What if it was an evasion?

364
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:40,294
Camouflaging the truth
in an expression of love?

365
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,045
I dismissed
my concern immediately.

366
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:46,674
Merely my professional paranoia.

367
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:50,771
After all, she was my wife.

368
00:23:51,481 --> 00:23:54,054
I don't regret
having married her.

369
00:23:54,943 --> 00:23:57,149
I have Sydney because
of our time together.

370
00:23:57,237 --> 00:24:02,397
What I do regret is once
I saw signs of her duplicity,

371
00:24:02,492 --> 00:24:07,735
once I sensed her betrayal,
I chose to ignore it.

372
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,161
All I'm asking is that you
be responsive to the signs

373
00:24:12,252 --> 00:24:15,502
if and when
they present themselves.

374
00:24:21,803 --> 00:24:24,092
You never respected me.

375
00:24:24,889 --> 00:24:27,511
Never thought I was
worthy of your daughter.

376
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,550
I'm not surprised you're quick
to think Lauren is betraying me.

377
00:24:32,188 --> 00:24:35,392
But whether or not
you or Sydney believe me,

378
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:37,559
I know the life I'm living,

379
00:24:37,652 --> 00:24:40,938
and I know the woman
I am married to.

380
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:46,321
Lauren is not Irina,
and I am definitely not you.

381
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:03,047
This is what The Covenant
was looking for.

382
00:25:03,136 --> 00:25:03,836
DNA?

383
00:25:03,928 --> 00:25:04,877
The worm was designed

384
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:06,549
to cross-reference genetic
databases,

385
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,965
searching the entire globe
for one person.

386
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,976
Judging by the double-X
chromosome, I'm saying female.

387
00:25:12,062 --> 00:25:13,176
Have they found a match?

388
00:25:13,271 --> 00:25:14,682
That's a good question.

389
00:25:14,773 --> 00:25:16,849
There are 10.

390
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:19,314
10 matches to one code?
That's impossible.

391
00:25:19,402 --> 00:25:20,861
Unless they're
identical dectuplets,

392
00:25:20,945 --> 00:25:22,938
which is a statistical
impossibility.

393
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:25,320
Or if the person
uses different identities.

394
00:25:25,408 --> 00:25:27,864
We should brief Dixon
immediately.

395
00:26:14,082 --> 00:26:15,825
Have you seen Lauren?

396
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:17,328
Yeah, she's in
Marshall's office.

397
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:18,877
Thanks.

398
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:52,365
- You scared me.
- I was looking for you.

399
00:26:52,454 --> 00:26:54,411
I was leaving
a present for Marshall.

400
00:26:54,497 --> 00:26:56,537
Well, for Mitchell.

401
00:26:58,042 --> 00:27:00,664
Don't worry.
Your name's on it, too.

402
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:03,376
I was gonna have lunch.
Cafe Stella.

403
00:27:03,465 --> 00:27:05,125
I've got to run a few errands.

404
00:27:05,216 --> 00:27:06,711
Need some company?
I've got time.

405
00:27:06,801 --> 00:27:09,968
You don't have to do that.
I'll see you there in an hour.

406
00:27:10,055 --> 00:27:11,881
Okay. Sure.

407
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:17,571
Is this line secure?

408
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:21,536
There's been a change.

409
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:22,575
No dead drop.

410
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:24,377
You'll be meeting
with a Covenant agent.

411
00:28:24,462 --> 00:28:26,087
- Who?
- Me.

412
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:28,746
I'm in the parking garage,
third level.

413
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:32,049
My situation is precarious.

414
00:28:32,137 --> 00:28:35,138
This is not the time
to change protocol.

415
00:28:42,814 --> 00:28:44,688
Run a tap on Lauren's cellphone.

416
00:28:44,774 --> 00:28:47,182
We devised a new plan
regarding The Passenger.

417
00:28:47,277 --> 00:28:50,610
Bomani's instructed me to meet
with you face-to-face.

418
00:28:50,697 --> 00:28:53,947
I'm surprised. I'd assumed that
given what happened with Cypher,

419
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:56,073
Bomani would be furious with me.

420
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:58,996
We rely on you.
You know that.

421
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:04,534
The call's encrypted.
She must be talking to the NSC.

422
00:29:04,627 --> 00:29:07,332
Try running it
through the filter.

423
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:12,128
Get off the escalator.
I'm in the northwest corner.

424
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:17,217
You came all this way?

425
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:21,385
Okay, okay, almost there.

426
00:29:21,478 --> 00:29:22,806
We need to talk.

427
00:29:22,896 --> 00:29:25,054
There are other ways
to make contact.

428
00:29:25,148 --> 00:29:28,932
Yes, but he insisted that
I meet with you face-to-face.

429
00:29:31,738 --> 00:29:34,311
What else did Bomani tell you?

430
00:29:34,407 --> 00:29:37,361
Did he instruct you on
the quietest way to murder me?

431
00:29:37,452 --> 00:29:38,483
Absolutely not.

432
00:29:38,578 --> 00:29:41,579
You pathetic little errand boy.

433
00:29:42,373 --> 00:29:45,078
Tell Bomani he'll get proof of
my worth next time he sees me.

434
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:46,366
When I deliver The Passenger.

435
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:47,576
I got it.

436
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,959
After all we've been through,
how could you do this?

437
00:29:50,048 --> 00:29:54,211
I thought I could rely on you.
I'll never forgive you for this.

438
00:29:54,302 --> 00:29:56,342
Okay.
What the hell was that?

439
00:29:56,429 --> 00:29:58,422
I have no idea.

440
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:07,102
Sorry I'm late.

441
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,763
That's fine.
I was late myself.

442
00:30:11,986 --> 00:30:13,445
How were your errands?

443
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,692
They were fine.

444
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:16,904
Yeah?
What did you do?

445
00:30:16,991 --> 00:30:18,818
Just things.

446
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,037
Okay, like what kind of things?

447
00:30:24,457 --> 00:30:26,616
Truth is, I got a call
from my mother.

448
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:29,627
She kept bombarding me
with questions about my father,

449
00:30:29,712 --> 00:30:34,209
wanting to know why I didn't
see it, why I didn't stop him.

450
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:37,423
It was like she was blaming me.

451
00:30:37,512 --> 00:30:42,637
I was just so upset,
so I wandered around the mall.

452
00:30:46,855 --> 00:30:49,061
What's the matter?

453
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,319
I'm just sorry
you had to go through that.

454
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:03,026
The 10 names on Marshall's list
were aliases for the same woman.

455
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:06,241
It's possible this is
what Il Dire gave Sloane.

456
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:07,791
A way to identify this woman.

457
00:31:07,876 --> 00:31:10,414
We ran background checks
on all her identities.

458
00:31:10,503 --> 00:31:13,374
Records revealed she was treated
by the same physician.

459
00:31:13,465 --> 00:31:15,042
A Dr. Robert Viadro.

460
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:16,924
His practice is based in Milan.

461
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,718
Vaughn is on his way in now.

462
00:31:18,803 --> 00:31:20,796
You two leave tonight.

463
00:31:35,737 --> 00:31:37,445
Good afternoon.
Dr. Viadro?

464
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,906
Yes.

465
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,864
I need to speak with you.

466
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,488
It concerns The Passenger.

467
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,783
Who sent you?

468
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:50,120
The Covenant?

469
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,202
That is none of your --

470
00:32:21,324 --> 00:32:22,522
Good.

471
00:32:22,617 --> 00:32:24,242
We have some privacy.

472
00:32:39,342 --> 00:32:41,631
Where is The Passenger?

473
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:49,674
I said, where is The Passenger?

474
00:32:50,145 --> 00:32:53,015
She's safe.

475
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:16,829
Rambaldi.

476
00:33:19,215 --> 00:33:21,007
I'll go check upstairs.

477
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,591
You had to make this difficult.

478
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,773
It's terribly painful.

479
00:34:25,865 --> 00:34:28,570
Still, none are fatal.

480
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:40,669
Damn it!

481
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:43,962
Tell me what I need to know!

482
00:34:44,509 --> 00:34:46,751
I'll tell you.

483
00:35:31,723 --> 00:35:33,929
The Passenger.

484
00:35:34,017 --> 00:35:36,472
I have betrayed her.

485
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,016
I have betrayed her.

486
00:35:42,108 --> 00:35:43,852
Betrayed who?

487
00:35:45,195 --> 00:35:48,564
Years spent protecting her.

488
00:35:48,656 --> 00:35:51,147
And now she's alone.

489
00:35:51,242 --> 00:35:52,487
Who's she?

490
00:35:52,577 --> 00:35:54,368
Who are you protecting?

491
00:35:56,414 --> 00:35:58,371
Those guards were
Order of Rambaldi.

492
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:00,166
You're the one.

493
00:36:00,251 --> 00:36:02,078
The one from the prophecy.

494
00:36:03,755 --> 00:36:05,130
- Wait!
- Drop it!

495
00:36:05,215 --> 00:36:07,254
You will not hurt her.

496
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,151
Keep this in a safe place.

497
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,082
Here it is.

498
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:42,836
Everything you need
to find The Passenger.

499
00:36:42,919 --> 00:36:46,584
You went to great lengths
to secure this information.

500
00:36:47,048 --> 00:36:47,997
Thank you.

501
00:36:48,091 --> 00:36:52,041
I trust this removes any doubts
concerning my usefulness.

502
00:36:52,137 --> 00:36:54,295
Yes, yes.

503
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:55,338
You've done well.

504
00:36:55,432 --> 00:36:59,381
Unfortunately, The Covenant has
no more use of your services.

505
00:37:12,657 --> 00:37:17,153
I went to Los Angeles
to warn you, not kill you.

506
00:37:17,746 --> 00:37:20,949
Perhaps in the future,
you should try trusting me more.

507
00:37:27,505 --> 00:37:28,786
Sloane told you the truth.

508
00:37:28,882 --> 00:37:30,839
The black budget front
for The Trust

509
00:37:30,925 --> 00:37:32,420
is Project: Centigrade.

510
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,048
Details have been left for you
in the usual place.

511
00:37:35,138 --> 00:37:36,798
I am in your debt.

512
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,891
A fact which I hope
to benefit from someday.

513
00:37:39,976 --> 00:37:41,720
Be careful, Jack.

514
00:37:41,811 --> 00:37:44,765
The Trust is not a group
to be taken lightly.

515
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:49,725
I need to speak with you
in private.

516
00:37:51,946 --> 00:37:53,654
Do you recall that I requested

517
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,492
Dr. Barnett's notes from
her sessions with Sloane?

518
00:37:56,576 --> 00:37:59,281
Yes.
Did they reveal anything?

519
00:37:59,996 --> 00:38:01,194
Yes.

520
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:04,409
There is something in the notes
that concerns you.

521
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:08,712
In one of his sessions
with Barnett,

522
00:38:08,797 --> 00:38:11,252
Sloane admitted having
an affair with Irina

523
00:38:11,341 --> 00:38:13,298
while you were married.

524
00:38:40,787 --> 00:38:45,496
I found no evidence of the
existence of a so-called Trust.

525
00:38:46,876 --> 00:38:49,663
I find that very hard
to believe, Jack.

526
00:38:49,754 --> 00:38:51,035
A man with your contacts.

527
00:38:51,131 --> 00:38:53,669
I've done everything I can.

528
00:38:54,384 --> 00:38:58,631
I'm afraid the secrets you keep
are hard to uncover.

529
00:38:59,097 --> 00:39:02,181
Some of them you'll have
to take to your grave.

530
00:39:04,185 --> 00:39:08,598
If I die, I won't be able
to help you find The Passenger

531
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,525
before The Covenant does, Jack.

532
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,357
You have no idea
how that will affect you.

533
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:20,864
You and Sydney.

534
00:39:22,912 --> 00:39:23,908
Dad.

535
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:27,158
I heard what happened
with the doctor.

536
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,584
We were wrong about
The Passenger. It's a person.

537
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:33,161
The doctor sacrificed his life
trying to protect her.

538
00:39:33,256 --> 00:39:36,257
When he saw me, it was
almost like he recognised me.

539
00:39:36,342 --> 00:39:38,833
Like I was his worst fear
come to life.

540
00:39:38,928 --> 00:39:40,968
Dad, when he tried to kill me,

541
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,882
he was trying to protect
The Passenger from me.

542
00:39:42,974 --> 00:39:45,643
Sloane told me that
after Il Dire said "peace,"

543
00:39:45,727 --> 00:39:48,763
he searched for every possible
meaning in that message.

544
00:39:48,855 --> 00:39:50,646
He traced the etymology
of the word

545
00:39:50,732 --> 00:39:52,890
to its Greek form, "eirene."

546
00:39:52,984 --> 00:39:56,733
Also the derivation
of the name "Irina."

547
00:39:56,821 --> 00:40:00,736
Sydney, I think The Passenger
may be your mother.

548
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,417
I'm looking forward
to a weekend alone.

549
00:40:12,504 --> 00:40:14,543
Me too.

550
00:40:22,597 --> 00:40:24,969
So, what did you do
while I was gone?

551
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,406
I missed you.

552
00:40:44,994 --> 00:40:47,034
I'm going to run a bath.
