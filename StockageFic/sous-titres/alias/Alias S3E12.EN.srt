1
00:00:02,326 --> 00:00:04,900
Sydney can no longer be
your primary concern.

2
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:06,324
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

3
00:00:06,414 --> 00:00:08,821
If you care about
my daughter as you claim to,

4
00:00:08,916 --> 00:00:10,327
make her despise you,

5
00:00:10,418 --> 00:00:14,629
because your kindness
tortures her.

6
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:33,308
Dixon, it's me.
I'm at the naval hospital.

7
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,269
There's a sniper.
Lazarey's been shot!

8
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:42,729
The matter's taken care of.

9
00:02:12,873 --> 00:02:14,249
Three days ago,
the S.E.C. flagged

10
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,417
an offshore brokerage account
for a minor clerical violation.

11
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:19,460
An investigation revealed
that the account

12
00:02:19,547 --> 00:02:21,374
was not backed
by any hard currency.

13
00:02:21,465 --> 00:02:22,580
A phantom account?

14
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,833
Yes, and because
of its offshore status,

15
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:27,133
it was turned over to Langley,
run through channels.

16
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:29,379
Encoded in the names and values

17
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:32,095
of the fictitious stocks
within the portfolio,

18
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:33,726
cryptography found a message.

19
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:35,887
Something the sender
wanted us to find.

20
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,930
A Covenant official
wants to defect.

21
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:41,975
What are the terms?

22
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:43,978
In exchange for his extraction
and immunity, he's willing

23
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:47,108
to turn over everything
he knows about The Covenant.

24
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,319
Considering the means through
which he sent us this message,

25
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:51,989
we believe he has
top-tier access

26
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:54,535
inside the organisation.

27
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:58,709
I'm sending you to North Korea

28
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:01,546
posing as Swiss
insurance auditors.

29
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,121
You'll meet with the defector
in the Gai-Li marketplace,

30
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:05,841
1200 hours local.

31
00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:08,085
The identifying marker
will be three sugar cubes

32
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:10,218
placed on a napkin
at the edge of the table.

33
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:12,595
We've only got
a 15-minute window.

34
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:14,261
15 minutes?

35
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:15,596
Those were his terms.

36
00:03:15,686 --> 00:03:17,015
And he offered no contingency.

37
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:18,729
If we don't show up at the meet,

38
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:20,558
there's no assurance
that this opportunity

39
00:03:20,649 --> 00:03:21,812
will present itself again.

40
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,893
If this defector can lead us

41
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:25,564
to the inner workings
of The Covenant,

42
00:03:25,654 --> 00:03:27,481
we'll finally have them
on the ropes.

43
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:29,779
Wheels up in four hours.

44
00:03:34,163 --> 00:03:36,369
I was wondering if you have
any plans next Tuesday.

45
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:37,536
It's Michael's hockey night,

46
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,664
and I thought maybe
we could go out,

47
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,543
get some dinner.

48
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:44,167
Yeah, sure, that'd be nice.
Thanks.

49
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,130
See you next Tuesday.

50
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:54,175
So, The Covenant is in danger
of being compromised.

51
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:56,259
This is of great concern to us.

52
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:58,428
We'll send one of our own
in North Korea

53
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:00,513
to intercept the defector.

54
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:01,851
Do you know from which airfield

55
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,850
Agents Bristow and Vaughn
will be departing?

56
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,520
No, it wasn't mentioned.

57
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:07,319
I need the name of the airfield

58
00:04:07,405 --> 00:04:10,109
in order to eliminate
Agents Vaughn and Bristow.

59
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,117
The Covenant cannot accept
even the possibility

60
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:16,286
of the CIA getting
their hands on a defector.

61
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:24,790
Explain your hesitation.

62
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,832
Give me 30 minutes.

63
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,965
I'll get you
the information you need.

64
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:05,211
Do you have the number
for Giorgio's?

65
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:06,410
I want to make a reservation.

66
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:08,877
What were you doing?

67
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:11,374
Asking Sydney to dinner?

68
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:14,635
Michael, you asked me
to give her a chance.

69
00:05:14,722 --> 00:05:17,047
I'll drive you to the plane.
We can talk on the way.

70
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:18,968
Well, I have to go get my stuff.

71
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,139
Dover's five minutes
from the house.

72
00:05:20,227 --> 00:05:21,141
I'll drive myself.

73
00:05:21,228 --> 00:05:23,268
I don't want to start
socializing with Sydney.

74
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:24,980
We see her enough as it is.

75
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:27,687
Yeah, and for three months, it
was awkward and uncomfortable.

76
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:31,442
At least if we get to know
each other, we can be civil.

77
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,021
But I actually really like her.

78
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:36,983
Is that really
such a big problem?

79
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:40,656
No.
Of course not.

80
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,246
Number's in my Rolodex.

81
00:05:52,927 --> 00:05:54,172
Be safe.

82
00:05:55,846 --> 00:05:57,424
Okay.

83
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:07,394
Did you get it?

84
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:08,894
Dover.

85
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,643
In the next six hours,
a CIA fuselage

86
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:50,642
carrying two operatives
will be downed

87
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:53,023
at The Covenant's behest.

88
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,688
You are being deployed
to North Korea

89
00:06:56,782 --> 00:07:00,282
in order to procure
a Covenant defector.

90
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:03,948
If I may ask, who is our source
of intel at the CIA,

91
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,577
and how do we know
he's reliable?

92
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:12,172
Mr. Sark, don't burden yourself
with unnecessary details.

93
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:17,260
As my liaison to The Covenant,
Mr. Zisman,

94
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:20,096
I must say you're a great
disappointment to me.

95
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:23,431
You seem to be forgetting
one rather large detail.

96
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:26,803
That would be the $800 million
of my money

97
00:07:26,896 --> 00:07:29,647
used to fund this organisation.

98
00:07:30,107 --> 00:07:32,016
An organisation
that's proven to be

99
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:35,229
ineffective, disorganised,

100
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,230
and if you'll allow me
to be petty,

101
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,443
disrespectful
to its benefactors.

102
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:45,198
Shall I convey your sentiments
to my superiors?

103
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:47,080
If you wish.

104
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:51,707
You will go to North Korea.

105
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,295
Is that understood?

106
00:07:55,716 --> 00:07:57,543
Yes, sir.

107
00:08:25,496 --> 00:08:27,239
What are you reading?

108
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:30,202
Calvino.

109
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,080
Have you reviewed the file?

110
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:36,460
Of course I reviewed the file.

111
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:53,266
Okay.

112
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,976
This isn't going to work.

113
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,524
- What isn't?
- What have I done to you?

114
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:00,522
Nothing.
I don't have a problem.

115
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:02,109
Have I offended you
in some way?

116
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:03,777
By doing what, coming back?

117
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:06,869
Disrupting the perfect life
you had going on?

118
00:09:06,954 --> 00:09:08,235
I'm just sitting here
reading a book.

119
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,279
I haven't said anything.

120
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:11,165
You haven't said anything
in weeks.

121
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,828
We're supposed to be
working together.

122
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:14,116
If you want to work
with someone else,

123
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:15,540
we can make a switch.

124
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:16,910
I've done everything I can

125
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:18,880
to make this
ridiculous situation work.

126
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:20,757
You, me, and Lauren
working in the same office.

127
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:23,548
I have tried to walk around
with this fake smile

128
00:09:23,637 --> 00:09:26,259
pretending everything was fine
just the way it used to be.

129
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:28,970
That's not working for me
anymore.

130
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:33,269
This is it.

131
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:36,356
When we get back,
one of us has to go.

132
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:51,572
He's dead.

133
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:53,243
So is he.

134
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:13,180
We're in North Korean airspace.
We have to abort.

135
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,521
Vaughn, we have incoming!

136
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,370
It's still locked on.
It's turning back.

137
00:10:39,964 --> 00:10:41,624
There's another one!

138
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:53,724
They're both locked on!
I'm gonna flame us out!

139
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:54,842
We need the engines to land!

140
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:56,645
They're heat-seekers.
That's the only way.

141
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:58,688
I'm shutting off the engines.

142
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:24,380
Fire up the air start ignition.

143
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:26,009
A.S.I. on.

144
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:27,967
It's not working!

145
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:34,758
1,500 feet.
1,000 feet.

146
00:11:34,852 --> 00:11:38,019
We don't have enough juice
for a restart. Hang on!

147
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:47,042
Where the hell
is the State Department?

148
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,710
Sir, I've got D.O.D.
on line one.

149
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,509
What can you tell me?

150
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:54,421
Marshall, what's happening?

151
00:12:54,932 --> 00:12:57,803
There's been...

152
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,137
Agent Bristow?

153
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,354
What's going on?

154
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:06,019
Sydney and Vaughn's jet
was intercepted

155
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,648
by surface-to-air missiles
over North Korea.

156
00:13:08,738 --> 00:13:10,280
Their condition is unknown.

157
00:13:10,364 --> 00:13:11,562
Who was responsible?

158
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,899
Early Echelon reports indicate
the North Korean government

159
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,368
was not responsible.

160
00:13:15,453 --> 00:13:17,161
Therefore, we suspect
The Covenant.

161
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:19,239
If they survived,
the North Korean military

162
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,790
will be hunting them.

163
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,496
We're attempting to monitor
through satellite.

164
00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:25,662
When information comes in,
you'll be the first to know.

165
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:27,628
Thank you.

166
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:31,962
What Vaughn and Sydney need now
is our strength.

167
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,681
Jack, Lauren, my office.

168
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:40,848
I've just been informed
by the Joint Chiefs of Staff

169
00:13:40,936 --> 00:13:43,807
that we've been ordered
to stand down.

170
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,812
Given our tenuous relations
with North Korea,

171
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:49,771
their official position
on Sydney and Vaughn

172
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,985
is to disavow.

173
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:01,079
Unofficially, I say screw them.

174
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:02,576
Pool your resources.

175
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:06,534
We don't rest until Sydney and
Vaughn are back in our hands.

176
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,238
Base Ops, this is Mountaineer.

177
00:15:16,323 --> 00:15:18,067
4-Alpha-Delta.

178
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,867
Do you copy?

179
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,953
Base Ops, do you copy?

180
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,115
- Anything?
- Comms are dead. You?

181
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:28,742
No. Can't get to the artillery.
Their cargo door's jammed.

182
00:15:28,836 --> 00:15:30,461
What's your best guess
on our coordinates?

183
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:33,796
We can't be more than 40 minutes
southwest of our L.Z.

184
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:38,091
What happened?

185
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:39,970
I'm fine.

186
00:15:41,182 --> 00:15:42,261
Okay.

187
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:44,223
We have eight hours
until our meet,

188
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,643
which means on foot,
we're gonna miss our window.

189
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:50,105
That's military.

190
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:25,303
They're 100 metres out.
We got to move.

191
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:37,121
This is Jack.

192
00:17:37,214 --> 00:17:38,495
I heard about Sydney.

193
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:39,871
Has there been any word?

194
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:41,248
Nothing yet.

195
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:42,624
Well, then let me help.

196
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,555
Omnifam has strong ties
to the premier of China.

197
00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:46,588
Thank you.

198
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:48,889
If I need your help,
I'll let you know.

199
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:58,728
I think we're clear.

200
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:00,397
Yeah, for now.

201
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:02,361
Let me see.

202
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:22,123
That's for being a jerk
on the plane.

203
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:26,506
Thanks.

204
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,348
We've got seven hours to get
to the Gai-Li marketplace.

205
00:18:31,435 --> 00:18:33,760
We need to find transportation.

206
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,725
What?

207
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,690
Nothing.

208
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,802
Your daughter is alive.

209
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:10,296
So is Agent Vaughn.

210
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,346
Do you mind if I ask
who you are?

211
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:19,190
What you should ask
is what I need you to do

212
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:21,813
in return for my assistance.

213
00:19:21,902 --> 00:19:23,942
I was going to get to that.

214
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,689
I will do everything in my power

215
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:28,486
to guarantee the safe return
of your daughter

216
00:19:28,576 --> 00:19:30,699
and her associate.

217
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,828
But I need something from you.

218
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,128
I need you to kill Arvin Sloane.

219
00:19:53,768 --> 00:19:54,716
Jack just called.

220
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,384
Vaughn and Sydney are alive.

221
00:19:58,522 --> 00:19:59,471
Where are they?

222
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,768
He didn't say, but he's
orchestrating an exit strategy.

223
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,146
Well, that --
Thank you!

224
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,695
Nothing.

225
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,993
We'll have a better chance
once we get to Gai-Li.

226
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:35,094
The tyres still have air.

227
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:37,058
Still some gas.

228
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:38,936
- How's it look?
- I don't know.

229
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:41,310
Pull me some wiring
out of the dashboard.

230
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,439
Thanks.

231
00:20:48,531 --> 00:20:50,737
It could still take a charge.

232
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,739
Spin the generator pulley.

233
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,403
We've got a heartbeat.
Keep it spinning.

234
00:20:58,499 --> 00:21:01,251
We have to generate enough
charge to spark the engine.

235
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,871
Listen, earlier, on the plane.

236
00:21:07,425 --> 00:21:08,919
It's okay.

237
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:14,299
It's the only thing
I could ever count on.

238
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,466
The way it felt to be with you.
How easy it was.

239
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,966
That's all gone now.

240
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:21,552
How are we supposed
to get along and be friends?

241
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,055
You're right.
It's ridiculous.

242
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,445
I slept with Will.

243
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,108
What?

244
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,733
In Warsaw.

245
00:21:34,618 --> 00:21:35,567
We got drunk.

246
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,117
And we slept together.

247
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,871
How am I supposed to react
to that?

248
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:46,661
However you want to.

249
00:21:50,968 --> 00:21:52,961
Bad enough being a fugitive
in North Korea.

250
00:21:53,054 --> 00:21:55,379
Now I have to find out
you slept with Will?

251
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,935
I want you to know
that I'm moving on.

252
00:22:04,065 --> 00:22:05,013
Not with Will.

253
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:08,441
Just generally.

254
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:14,405
If it helps.

255
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:21,370
Alright,
that should be enough.

256
00:22:21,457 --> 00:22:23,913
Yeah, you're probably right.

257
00:22:25,461 --> 00:22:27,003
Okay.

258
00:22:46,857 --> 00:22:49,183
Your operative in North Korea
should be advised

259
00:22:49,276 --> 00:22:51,684
that Agents Bristow and Vaughn
are still in play.

260
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:54,484
- How is that possible?
- That's what I'd like to know.

261
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:57,278
Particularly as I jeopardise
my standing within the CIA

262
00:22:57,368 --> 00:22:58,743
for an offencive which failed.

263
00:22:58,828 --> 00:23:01,401
I'll pass the news along.

264
00:23:18,055 --> 00:23:19,134
Mr. Cho, please.

265
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:20,302
We're closed.

266
00:23:20,391 --> 00:23:24,519
The black sparrow seeks
an audience with Mr. Cho.

267
00:23:25,646 --> 00:23:27,722
Yes.
I'll let him know.

268
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:29,689
I prefer to remain unannounced.

269
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,147
We shall not be disturbed.

270
00:23:33,821 --> 00:23:38,816
Mr. Cho, I apologise
for disturbing your meal.

271
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:41,531
An unexpected delight.

272
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,827
I was under the impression
that you were never returning

273
00:23:43,914 --> 00:23:45,872
to the United States.

274
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:47,788
Sit.

275
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,289
This is not a social call.

276
00:23:54,383 --> 00:23:56,625
You have a debt to pay.

277
00:23:58,012 --> 00:23:59,672
Yes.

278
00:23:59,764 --> 00:24:01,009
I'm aware.

279
00:24:01,098 --> 00:24:03,387
I need an extraction.

280
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:05,136
From Q-Gong province.

281
00:24:05,227 --> 00:24:07,054
Two Americans.

282
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,979
No, I'm sorry.

283
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:14,903
That's more than even I can do.

284
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:23,742
This is not a negotiation.

285
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:38,291
The repercussions.
They're too dangerous for me.

286
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:44,593
I am not concerned
of the repercussions.

287
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:45,928
Yes.

288
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,512
Yes, I'll call Kwan.

289
00:24:47,603 --> 00:24:49,512
Mr. Kwan can help us.

290
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:56,607
Everything you need to know.

291
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,107
Don't fail me.

292
00:25:03,953 --> 00:25:06,076
We'll be in touch.

293
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,570
I've never been this on time
in my life.

294
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:53,951
There he is.

295
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,830
Let's go.

296
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,385
Wait.

297
00:26:14,857 --> 00:26:16,814
Mister...

298
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:18,443
I'm sorry.

299
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,105
You forgot to give us your name.

300
00:26:20,196 --> 00:26:22,521
You first.

301
00:26:23,157 --> 00:26:25,114
I'm Agent Hollier.

302
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:26,992
I'm with the CIA.

303
00:26:28,537 --> 00:26:29,818
We have to get in there now.

304
00:26:29,914 --> 00:26:32,831
Any move we make,
Sark kills him.

305
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:34,292
Not necessarily.

306
00:26:34,377 --> 00:26:36,203
Which field office of the CIA

307
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:38,418
did you say you were from,
Mr. Hollier?

308
00:26:38,506 --> 00:26:40,997
Portland office.

309
00:26:41,092 --> 00:26:42,586
I have a car waiting,

310
00:26:42,676 --> 00:26:44,835
and a plane fuelled up
ready to go.

311
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:49,258
You are on your way to becoming
a God-blessed American citizen.

312
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,976
Gloria Estefan.

313
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:56,809
What about her?

314
00:26:56,899 --> 00:26:59,900
I like her.

315
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:04,980
Four years, The Covenant has
had me here in North Korea.

316
00:27:05,616 --> 00:27:08,451
This culture has no...

317
00:27:09,787 --> 00:27:11,780
pep.

318
00:27:11,872 --> 00:27:13,153
America, though.

319
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:14,494
Lots of pep.

320
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:16,208
Well, I assure you,

321
00:27:16,293 --> 00:27:19,627
the United States
will be happy to have you.

322
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:22,461
Yes.

323
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,875
The Covenant must be stopped.

324
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:28,679
What they are planning
keeps me awake at night,

325
00:27:28,764 --> 00:27:30,508
not sleeping.

326
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:35,261
My friend, tonight you'll sleep
very soundly.

327
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:39,890
Stay calm.

328
00:27:39,984 --> 00:27:41,359
Nobody move.

329
00:27:41,444 --> 00:27:43,317
What is this?

330
00:27:43,404 --> 00:27:45,231
Listen very closely.
This man is not CIA.

331
00:27:45,322 --> 00:27:46,271
He's Covenant.

332
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:47,694
Covenant?

333
00:27:47,783 --> 00:27:49,527
We're CIA.

334
00:27:49,618 --> 00:27:51,161
This was huge mistake.

335
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:53,321
You have to trust us.

336
00:27:57,501 --> 00:27:59,909
I believe their Army

337
00:28:00,004 --> 00:28:02,329
is in search of fugitives
from a downed aeroplane.

338
00:28:02,423 --> 00:28:04,332
Suspected CIA.

339
00:28:04,425 --> 00:28:07,509
Look, let's make this
easy for each other.

340
00:28:07,595 --> 00:28:09,219
Leonid and I are going
to walk out of here.

341
00:28:09,305 --> 00:28:11,297
Sydney is going to keep
the knife where it is

342
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,588
until we are clear.

343
00:28:12,683 --> 00:28:14,058
Once we are, she will follow us.

344
00:28:14,143 --> 00:28:15,471
If you stick to that plan,

345
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:17,518
you might still have
children one day.

346
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:19,478
Except the execution
of your threat

347
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:21,973
would tip off our friends
over there.

348
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,276
It seems everyone has
something to lose.

349
00:28:26,364 --> 00:28:29,946
Everyone, except for me.

350
00:28:30,034 --> 00:28:31,065
Goodbye.

351
00:29:00,064 --> 00:29:01,891
It's not deep.

352
00:29:01,982 --> 00:29:03,774
- But the liver...
- I know.

353
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:07,643
I'll need you to check
if the tissue's intact.

354
00:29:07,738 --> 00:29:08,687
Tell me.

355
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:12,067
Which of Irina's sisters
are you?

356
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,912
Yelena or Yekaterina?

357
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:24,497
I haven't been Yekaterina
since I was a child.

358
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:27,424
My sisters call me Katya,

359
00:29:27,508 --> 00:29:31,173
which means Irina wasn't the one
who told you about me.

360
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:34,003
Learning that your wife
is actually a Russian spy

361
00:29:34,098 --> 00:29:38,392
drives you to learn all you can
about her true identity.

362
00:29:45,443 --> 00:29:47,768
The tissue is stable.

363
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:51,316
As observant as you are,

364
00:29:51,407 --> 00:29:53,530
you were married
to my sister for five years

365
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:57,829
without suspecting
who she really was.

366
00:29:58,873 --> 00:30:02,289
Her love must have been
intoxicating.

367
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:08,669
Mr. Kwan will see that Sydney
will return home safely.

368
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,798
Now you have something
to do for me.

369
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:19,475
And what do you
possibly have to gain

370
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,849
from my executing Arvin Sloane?

371
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:25,938
And why me?

372
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:32,395
I consider the assassination
a preventative measure.

373
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,198
And why you?

374
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:38,323
It's not for you to ask.

375
00:30:38,412 --> 00:30:40,120
We had an agreement.

376
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:44,453
You choose not to deliver,
I call off Mr. Kwan.

377
00:31:51,694 --> 00:31:53,817
CIA.

378
00:31:54,864 --> 00:31:56,406
They're CIA.

379
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,400
I will talk.

380
00:31:59,076 --> 00:32:00,321
Thank you.

381
00:32:32,193 --> 00:32:33,687
Sydney, come here.

382
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:36,351
Come here, Sydney.

383
00:33:00,304 --> 00:33:03,922
Jack Bristow.
I have a 3.00 with Arvin Sloane.

384
00:33:05,518 --> 00:33:08,472
Sir, Jack Bristow's here
to see you.

385
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,190
Arvin Sloane, please.

386
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:21,819
You have a call on line one.

387
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,952
Yes?

388
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:30,080
I assume you know who this is.

389
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:34,207
I do.

390
00:33:34,296 --> 00:33:35,672
I have a message for you.

391
00:33:35,756 --> 00:33:37,963
Back off Irina.

392
00:33:41,095 --> 00:33:43,633
I'm not sure
how I'm supposed to take that.

393
00:33:43,723 --> 00:33:45,430
Listen to me carefully.

394
00:33:45,516 --> 00:33:47,722
No matter how protected
you think you are,

395
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,553
you are not.

396
00:33:49,645 --> 00:33:52,136
Even from your friends.

397
00:33:53,441 --> 00:33:56,525
Even the one
you are about to see.

398
00:33:57,361 --> 00:33:59,983
Your continuing life
is a favour...

399
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:01,697
from me.

400
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:09,654
This is Jack.

401
00:34:09,749 --> 00:34:11,706
Change of plan.
I need you to abort.

402
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:14,330
I'll explain later.

403
00:34:16,338 --> 00:34:19,375
Mr. Bristow, he'll see you now.

404
00:34:28,517 --> 00:34:30,759
Tell me, Jack.

405
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:34,056
Did you reconsider
my offer to help Sydney?

406
00:34:34,523 --> 00:34:37,690
I just wanted to let you know
I think we're making progress.

407
00:34:38,152 --> 00:34:40,026
That's good.

408
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:43,362
So you've extracted
Sydney from North Korea?

409
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,358
I'm working on it.

410
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:47,574
I was able to contact
someone on the inside

411
00:34:47,661 --> 00:34:49,453
who could help us.

412
00:34:52,249 --> 00:34:55,416
And you came all the way
to Zurich to tell me this?

413
00:34:55,503 --> 00:34:57,045
No.

414
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:58,707
I had a meeting locally,

415
00:34:58,798 --> 00:35:02,167
but I wanted to drop in,
tell you in person.

416
00:35:02,885 --> 00:35:04,628
You've done a lot
for Sydney lately.

417
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,927
I felt I owed you the courtesy.

418
00:35:07,014 --> 00:35:08,888
I see.

419
00:35:10,267 --> 00:35:11,347
Thank you.

420
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:17,605
I remember years ago,

421
00:35:17,692 --> 00:35:20,099
I was working at SD-6.

422
00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:25,361
I was on my way
to a meeting in Berlin.

423
00:35:25,449 --> 00:35:27,857
It was a typical day,

424
00:35:27,952 --> 00:35:30,869
except K-Directorate
made an attempt on my life.

425
00:35:30,955 --> 00:35:32,615
As I opened the car door,

426
00:35:32,707 --> 00:35:34,699
a sniper shot
came out of nowhere.

427
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:36,072
Bullet grazed my neck.

428
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:38,540
Actually left a burn mark.

429
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:45,128
You never forget
what that feels like.

430
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:49,930
To barely escape
with your life.

431
00:35:52,768 --> 00:35:55,639
I have a plane waiting.

432
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,971
Then you should go.

433
00:36:05,322 --> 00:36:08,074
We're not going to make it
out of here.

434
00:36:13,873 --> 00:36:16,494
There's something
I need you to know.

435
00:36:19,462 --> 00:36:21,620
In my life...

436
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:24,872
...there is only one person.

437
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:25,916
Don't do this.

438
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,552
Look at me.

439
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,342
The only reason
I pushed you away...

440
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:33,927
Please.

441
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:37,718
The only reason is I didn't know
how to be around you.

442
00:36:37,813 --> 00:36:39,640
They're coming.

443
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:45,650
I know, Vaughn.

444
00:36:46,364 --> 00:36:48,237
I know.

445
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:53,408
We'll find each other.

446
00:36:53,496 --> 00:36:56,034
We always find each other.

447
00:38:43,814 --> 00:38:46,851
I'm Mr. Kwan.
I'm here to help you.

448
00:38:51,405 --> 00:38:52,983
What is happening?

449
00:38:55,326 --> 00:38:57,318
I'm sorry for the things
I have --

450
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,248
Thank you.

451
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:06,833
Before, I hope you did not think
I was betraying you in any way.

452
00:39:06,921 --> 00:39:10,005
What I was trying to do was --

453
00:39:10,883 --> 00:39:12,211
Thank you.

454
00:40:44,143 --> 00:40:46,599
- So sorry. Excuse me.
- That's okay.

455
00:40:53,944 --> 00:40:56,317
How did you find me?

456
00:40:56,405 --> 00:40:58,197
Your mother found you.

457
00:41:16,217 --> 00:41:18,505
You warned him, didn't you?

458
00:41:20,304 --> 00:41:22,297
Whatever trust
I'd established with him

459
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,845
over the last three months
has been compromised.

460
00:41:24,934 --> 00:41:27,259
What I can't figure out is,

461
00:41:27,353 --> 00:41:30,638
how will this play
to Irina's advantage?

462
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:32,356
Or your own?

463
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:36,066
One day
when you least expect it,

464
00:41:36,153 --> 00:41:39,771
Irina's intentions will
present themselves to you.

465
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:41,775
And when that day comes,
I promise you,

466
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:44,619
it will be unmistakable.

467
00:41:47,665 --> 00:41:50,238
Thank you for helping Sydney.

468
00:41:51,419 --> 00:41:54,289
Isn't that what family's for?

469
00:41:57,842 --> 00:41:59,751
That was from Irina.

470
00:42:15,651 --> 00:42:17,644
And who was that from?

471
00:42:18,779 --> 00:42:21,104
Too many questions.
