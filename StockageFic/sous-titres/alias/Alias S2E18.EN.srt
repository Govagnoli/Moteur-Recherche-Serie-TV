1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:02,702
Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

2
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:06,792
I met Emily shortly after I started working
at Credit Dauphine.

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:10,464
She was the mother all of us wish we had.

4
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,921
- Emily, we did it.
- Are you sure it worked?

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,718
Yes, my love.

6
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:20,093
We're free.

7
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,980
I've been sent here
to investigate Michael Vaughn.

8
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:31,106
It's come to our attention
that over the past three months,

9
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:36,274
Mr Vaughn has been in contact with a
number of unapproved foreign operatives.

10
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,828
You're being investigated?

11
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:41,661
If there is some explanation for what
you've been doing the past four months,

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,328
I need to hear what it is. Right now.

13
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:50,288
You suggest that we allow Irina Derevko
to make contact with Arvin Sloane?

14
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:54,428
I've had 20 years to reflect
on that woman's ability to deceive.

15
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:59,340
Trust me.
If she lies to me again, I'll know it.

16
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,181
I realise the plan
was for Mr Sloane to meet you here,

17
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,939
but for security reasons
I'm afraid that's impossible.

18
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,024
If you get in, I'll take you to him.

19
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,942
We've lost downlink.

20
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,785
Jack, we're blind.
You'll have to follow her from your end.

21
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,989
- Activate the tracking device.
- I can't.

22
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,876
Step out of the car, please.

23
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,878
Thank you for extracting me.

24
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,824
Freeze!

25
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,947
We have a casualty.
Woman down. We need a medic.

26
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,274
They'll probably keep me
in debrief for a while.

27
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,441
You'll be OK.

28
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,614
- If you never see me again, it was fun.
- Oh, shut up.

29
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:24,195
- Mr Vaughn. Mr Yeager would like to...
- Talk to me. Yeah, I know.

30
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:49,222
- Dad. I need to talk to you about Vaughn.
- I know he's under investigation.

31
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,934
He's innocent. He was investigating Mom.
It wasn't treason.

32
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:56,187
Sydney, the operation in Panama
didn't go as planned.

33
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,113
What happened? Is Mom OK?

34
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,986
Your mother betrayed us.
Betrayed the CIA.

35
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,324
Her meeting with Sloane
was staged to secure her escape.

36
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,748
You don't know that. Sloane could've
set up the meet to abduct her.

37
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:15,038
Before the operation,
she swapped the Rambaldi manuscript.

38
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:21,382
She left us with a fake. She and Sloane
are now in possession of the original.

39
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,877
Sydney, they planned this.

40
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,376
I heard... about your mother.

41
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,291
I'm... so sorry.

42
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,221
There's a briefing in ten minutes.

43
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,262
They're drawing up a plan
to capture Sloane and your mother.

44
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:15,682
I'm supposed to tell you
you're not obligated to go.

45
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:27,440
My mother's earrings. They found a note
she left. She wanted me to have them.

46
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:37,368
Just now, when my dad was telling me, the
first thought I had was that she was dead.

47
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,710
That she's been killed.

48
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,753
I had this whole thing in my head,

49
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,344
that she died proving herself...

50
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,718
a hero.

51
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,601
No one can be blamed
for trusting their own mother.

52
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,812
I wish that she had been killed.

53
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,657
I still have operatives
in St Petersburg, Madrid and Cairo.

54
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,792
- How reliable?
- They're loyal.

55
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,964
Good. You? Are you all right?

56
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:30,005
- The extraction went well.
- I'm asking about you, Irina.

57
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,227
- I'm happy to see you again.
- I was thinking the same thing myself.

58
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,273
What about the genetic database?

59
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:45,060
Sark and I will meet you back in Zurich
as soon as we've acquired it.

60
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:49,900
- You'll have the files soon.
- Good. I'll be in Tuscany. With Emily.

61
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:53,943
- How is she?
- She's in remission.

62
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:59,080
The hard part for her now is missing
the people that she had to leave behind.

63
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,541
Especially Sydney.

64
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,507
You know how much we loved her.

65
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,834
As if she were our own.

66
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,138
Excuse us.

67
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,766
- I see through you. You must know that.
- This is who I am.

68
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:29,404
You may need to think of yourself
as an honourable husband or father-figure,

69
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,112
but I don't. I will never see that man in you.

70
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,203
Which, frankly, is why
we have this agreement.

71
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,997
You need to get some rest.

72
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:44,295
Never... talk to me
about your love for Sydney again.

73
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,214
Get some rest.

74
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:03,851
As many of you know, our attempt
to capture Arvin Sloane failed.

75
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:08,936
We believe that Irina Derevko, while in
our custody, somehow contacted Sloane,

76
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,438
informed him of our intention
to apprehend him

77
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,988
and used it as an opportunity to escape.

78
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,362
Due to Jack Bristow's
intimate knowledge of the fugitives

79
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:22,912
and his long-standing written record
of accurate predictions regarding Derevko,

80
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:28,044
Langley has given him
operational control of this task force.

81
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,927
In all likelihood Sloane and Derevko
have formed a strategic partnership.

82
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:42,640
As of this morning, our single aim
will be their apprehension.

83
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,815
Derevko has been tagged
with a passive tracking device.

84
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,940
Excuse me, sir. Sorry to interrupt.

85
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:52,773
By the way, congratulations on the...
heading the operational... task force.

86
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,867
The device that we implanted
in Derevko wasn't passive.

87
00:08:55,952 --> 00:09:01,457
Yes, it is. I removed the original device
in case Derevko was swept for bugs.

88
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,246
Without her knowledge,
I injected her with a passive transmitter.

89
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:05,878
Wow.

90
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:11,383
That's smart, because if they do a sweep
they won't pick up anything till it transmits.

91
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,887
Hey, how'd you plant it
without her knowing?

92
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:21,597
The transmitter's programmed
to send a signal 12 hours from now.

93
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:25,636
That allows her enough time
to reach Sloane before going active.

94
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,140
A tactical team's on standby
out of Edwards Air Force Base.

95
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:33,395
Once we acquire the signal
we'll move in and take them into custody.

96
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,743
I don't know what to say.

97
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:49,250
This house is... When will we know
if they accept the offer?

98
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,755
- I closed last week.
- What?

99
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,423
I wanted to surprise you.

100
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,882
I just wanted to make you happy.

101
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,928
These past few months
have been like a bad dream.

102
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,852
Thank God we got through it.

103
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,060
I love you.

104
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,744
Nice grouping.

105
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,909
Hey.

106
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,547
- What happened?
- They downgraded my security clearance.

107
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,300
But only until Counterintelligence
clears me officially.

108
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:38,334
Meanwhile, your father convinced them
to keep me field-rated.

109
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,297
- Then you heard about my mother?
- Yeah.

110
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,055
- You were right to investigate her.
- Sydney...

111
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:54,356
No, it's OK, it's the truth. I'm not blaming
you. It's me. I was so naive about her.

112
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,818
I don't think you should
be part of this task force.

113
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:05,111
You know how I feel about her, but no one
should have to hunt down their mother,

114
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,291
no matter what the circumstances are.

115
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,828
- She was never my mother.
- You want to believe that?

116
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,373
- Don't do this again, don't condescend.
- That is not what I'm doing. You know that.

117
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,586
If you corner her and you hesitate
to pull the trigger even for one second,

118
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,549
it could cost you your life.

119
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,686
I won't hesitate.

120
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,634
Let me be blunt, Jack.

121
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,051
I accepted your recommendation
to trust Derevko

122
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,063
because you made a strong argument.
A personal one.

123
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,900
An argument which,
I now understand, you didn't believe,

124
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:19,362
or you wouldn't have placed a passive
transmitter on her without informing me.

125
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,448
It was my call to let her out,
and I stand by that decision,

126
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,526
but you blindsided me, you son of a bitch.

127
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,953
And your pretence of an apology
doesn't do either of us any good.

128
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,871
I'll be equally blunt. From the moment
Irina Derevko walked in this door,

129
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,830
you ordered Sydney to deal with her,
over my objections.

130
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,412
With absolute disregard
for her emotional wellbeing.

131
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,464
It was my prerogative. I stand by that call.

132
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,963
That said, it's not my intention
to replace you.

133
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:47,923
As soon as I'm satisfied that Derevko
can never harm my daughter again,

134
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:50,972
you'll have your title back.

135
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:54,478
Excuse me... Actually, I'm not sure
who I'm supposed to address,

136
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,973
cos, you know, you're both standing here...
Who's in charge?

137
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,064
What is it, Marshall?

138
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:02,945
The passive transmitter that Mr Bristow
injected into his wife... ex-wife, sorry...

139
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:07,113
Well, um, it just went active.
And we're tracking her.

140
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,787
Base ops has tracked
Derevko's signal to Stuttgart.

141
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,958
Once on the ground, we will confirm
the signal with visual identification,

142
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:17,744
but we will not engage until we know
the whereabouts of all three.

143
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,623
We move in only after
Derevko's led us to Sloane.

144
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,226
Like many pharmaceutical companies,
the firm I represent

145
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,562
has closely monitored your work
mapping the human genome.

146
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,021
We are interested in licensing that work.

147
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,435
We're in the process
of fielding many such offers.

148
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:44,443
But I'm afraid your firm, Staad
Pharmaceutical, I'm not familiar with it.

149
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,023
We're a small Scandinavian consortium.

150
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:52,954
But I would not have come all this way
if I did not believe my offer was significant.

151
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,077
Our server room is where the data
is processed and stored.

152
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,960
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

153
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,581
The servers are located in sublevel E,
beyond radio contact.

154
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,000
When you're prepared for extraction,
I'll be standing by.

155
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:10,004
We're two blocks away from the
tracking signal. Any intel on that location?

156
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,512
Brucker Biotech. They're the German
equivalent of the Human Genome Project.

157
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,513
We're running an analysis
of the company -

158
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,975
every patent they hold, biographies of the
board members, political contributions...

159
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,855
Sloane and Derevko
with genetic research - that can't be good.

160
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:27,738
All right, I've hacked into their CCTV
system. I'm relaying the feed to you now.

161
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,233
Let's see what we've got.

162
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,330
Agent Bristow,
we're pulling into position.

163
00:14:55,687 --> 00:15:00,148
Hello, my name is Peter Gorrow. I'm Ms
Herksgaard's assistant. I'm running late.

164
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,732
Would it be possible to have a pass
waiting at the front desk? Thank you.

165
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,072
Sark.

166
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,366
We have a visual ID.
He's entering the building.

167
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,197
We see him. Hold your position.

168
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,872
For now. We've confirmed Derevko
and Sark. That's good enough for me.

169
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,453
Noted.

170
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,082
It took 15 years of analysis,

171
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:29,626
but we finally assembled all the information
into a DNA map of unequalled detail.

172
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,635
Sark's taking out surveillance cameras.
We lost the feed.

173
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,556
They may know we're here.

174
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:44,772
There's a tactical team out front. We've
been tracked. I swept myself, I'm clean.

175
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,317
Jack.

176
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,903
- The mission's compromised.
- It's harder now, but not impossible.

177
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,706
If we don't go in, we could lose everything.

178
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:02,125
The transmitter is still active.
Sloane is the objective.

179
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,213
Sloane may not be here.
They may not be working with Sloane.

180
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,798
I don't understand. When we extracted you
we scanned you for transmitters.

181
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:14,505
It must have been on a time delay.

182
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,388
Do it.

183
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,642
- We lost her.
- How?

184
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,603
I don't know. Fried somehow.
Overloaded, I guess.

185
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:30,901
- Signal's gone. There's nothing I can do.
- If we lose her now, we lose her for good.

186
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:32,647
Move in.

187
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,447
Call Brucker security. Tell them
two wanted terrorists are on the premises.

188
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:38,740
Have them seal the building.
We will meet them in the lobby.

189
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:42,035
- This will get us into the hard drive.
- Is the file on the network?

190
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:46,076
Yes, but it's encrypted. I'll transfer
the file and we can decipher it later.

191
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,999
- How long to download?
- Five minutes.

192
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,796
- See there's no evidence we were here.
- I'll take care of it.

193
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:54,669
I'll set the detonator for six minutes.
Meet me at the extraction point.

194
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,837
Vaughn! Vaughn!

195
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,816
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

196
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:32,569
Come on.

197
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,527
- What about Derevko?
- She's gotta be here.

198
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,735
Sydney!

199
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,580
Dad, I see her.

200
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,919
We're going after her.

201
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,833
She's exiting the building.

202
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,781
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

203
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:37,752
- What's for dinner?
- Ribollita.

204
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,596
It's bread and vegetable soup.

205
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:50,598
- Well, it sounds great. I'll get the Barolo.
- OK.

206
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,035
Hello?

207
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,419
May I speak with your husband?

208
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,500
Yes, just a moment.

209
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,798
It's for you. It's a woman.

210
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,308
Thanks. Yeah?

211
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:30,015
I've recovered the file.

212
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,972
But I was tracked.

213
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,272
- By whom?
- The CIA.

214
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,860
Until we know otherwise, we have
to assume you've been exposed as well.

215
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:43,364
You'd better leave the house
until we know for sure.

216
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,942
- Yeah, I agree.
- Meet me at the airfield.

217
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,699
OK.

218
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,631
- We have to leave.
- What? Who was that?

219
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:02,382
I'll explain later, but we have to leave
the house. It's just a precaution.

220
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,717
- Against what? What's going on?
- Emily, we have to leave the house now.

221
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,596
- I don't understand.
- Look at me.

222
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:14,732
You have to trust me, Emily.
Please. You have to trust me.

223
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:23,198
Aside from cancer studies,
Brucker sponsor genetic research,

224
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,952
specifically the mapping and sequencing
of human chromosomes.

225
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:31,955
But, it's rumoured they've catalogued the
DNA of private citizens. Some say millions.

226
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:37,996
Well, if that's true, then for one...
I'm sorry to interrupt... Is that suede?

227
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:41,460
Yes.

228
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:44,303
Sloane could develop
a genetically-targeted virus,

229
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:48,005
or he could pollute the entire water supply
just to kill one specific person.

230
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,682
When he or she takes a drink of water
or takes a shower,

231
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,225
then the water
would permeate into the system...

232
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:59,391
I'll instruct the NSA to add every derivation
of genetics to the Echelon watch list.

233
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,733
Uh, excuse me.

234
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:08,865
Did you say that, before the explosion,
your mother called out your name?

235
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,527
- Yes.
- Why'd she do that?

236
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:14,292
Doesn't that seem weird to anyone,
or is that just me?

237
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:17,958
It's cool if it's just me, because...
It is just me, isn't it?

238
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:22,174
Irina might have wanted
to save Sydney's life.

239
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,592
I doubt that's the case.

240
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:37,477
- What do you mean, you own this?
- It's my plane, sweetheart. It's ours.

241
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:41,610
Arvin, I've been more than patient.
It's enough.

242
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,940
Hello.

243
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:52,492
I don't understand.

244
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,078
Laura, I thought...

245
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,917
Arvin will tell you.

246
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,835
The disk, as promised.

247
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,015
- Emily, sit down.
- How long have you known she was alive?

248
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,184
A couple of months.

249
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:21,772
And you didn't tell me this?
What the hell is going on?

250
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,733
- Emily...
- Tell me.

251
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,355
Don't treat me like a fool.
Stop telling me the deception is all over.

252
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:31,612
I had to wait. I wanted to make sure
that it was going to work.

253
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:35,154
What are we doing here
with a woman who died 20 years ago?

254
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:40,040
What I'm pursuing... is truth.

255
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,536
Truth?

256
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,916
Good. Well, that explains it all.

257
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,464
I guess you and I
are looking for the same thing.

258
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:56,470
Emily, what I'm looking for, among other
things, will let you live cancer-free.

259
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,684
I am cancer-free.

260
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,812
Forever.

261
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:11,523
Wait, wait. You're saying in high school
my girlfriend dated a quarterback?

262
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:15,034
I mean, it was no big deal.
He was just this... god.

263
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:19,614
- What was his name, Frank or Hank?
- I forgot all about that guy.

264
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,122
Wow.

265
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:26,288
I went shopping the other day and I saw
something that reminded me of you. So...

266
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:29,593
- You bought Vaughn a present?
- Why not?

267
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:34,221
- Because it's the weirdest thing of all time?
- I just saw it and it reminded me of him.

268
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:36,383
Maybe you can do that for me sometime.

269
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,350
Nice. Thanks.

270
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:42,849
Well, see, you're making me look bad.
I still haven't bought him anything.

271
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:46,310
Sydney's always saying
that you wear suits, so I thought...

272
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,063
Wow.

273
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,694
It's beautiful. Thank you.
That's very sweet.

274
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:54,108
You're welcome.

275
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,205
We have to go.

276
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:08,044
- What's going on?
- You need to see this.

277
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:10,624
What is this?

278
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:14,134
The security camera at our consulate
in Florence last night.

279
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:28,982
She's alive?

280
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,653
She walked through the front door, told
the guard she was the wife of Arvin Sloane,

281
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:37,948
that she wants to cooperate with the CIA
and that she'll only talk to you.

282
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:14,532
I spoke at your funeral.

283
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:18,030
Arvin told me.

284
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:34,671
Yesterday, I felt exactly
the way you do now.

285
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:40,011
Seeing someone... I thought was gone.

286
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,973
My mother.

287
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:45,512
- You know?
- Yes.

288
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:48,562
I never wanted to put you through that.

289
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:53,276
But Arvin and I had no choice.

290
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:56,115
The Alliance had to believe I was dead.

291
00:26:57,033 --> 00:27:01,695
You knew about his involvement
with the Alliance and you stayed with him.

292
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:09,037
I know this is difficult
for you to understand,

293
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:13,340
but when I found out I had cancer,
Arvin...

294
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:18,883
was my tether to hope,

295
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:22,849
to survival.

296
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:27,892
And when I went into remission
he told me the truth.

297
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:33,141
He asked for my forgiveness and promised
that he would make things right.

298
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:39,234
He's been my whole world for 30 years.
He saved my life.

299
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,871
I couldn't deny my husband
a second chance.

300
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:47,661
Except nothing's changed.

301
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:57,752
I'm assuming that's why you're here.

302
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,346
He told me his plan.

303
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:07,894
To find out what this man,
Rambaldi, was working on.

304
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,193
He rationalises what he's done.

305
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:15,897
He says he's doing it for us.

306
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:17,481
For me.

307
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:23,157
Even if I believed him,

308
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:26,448
I won't be the excuse for his crimes.

309
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:29,955
I won't live with that on my conscience.

310
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:35,757
I'll help you bring him in.

311
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:41,842
But I need you to guarantee me
something in return.

312
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,006
What?

313
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,599
That he won't get the death penalty.

314
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:54,519
I want it in writing
before I tell you where he is.

315
00:28:57,112 --> 00:29:01,026
We can't make that deal. For all we know,
Sloane sent his wife in to mislead us.

316
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:02,396
Sydney trusts Emily.

317
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:06,075
Congratulations. But is that
enough reason to take that chance?

318
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:09,911
Why not threaten prosecution, compel her
to tell us where she's meeting Sloane?

319
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,455
- Prosecution for what?
- Are you kidding me?

320
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:15,082
Conspiracy, fraud,
aiding and abetting a terrorist...

321
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:20,628
We need Emily's cooperation and I believe
she'll lead us right to Sloane and Irina.

322
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:24,887
Fine. It's your call anyway, isn't it?

323
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,221
Go to Florence with Dixon.
I'll tell Sydney to make the deal.

324
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:34,938
A tactical plan will be ready for you
by the time you land.

325
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:39,236
I'm meeting a man this afternoon who can
get us six hours on a Cray-X1 computer.

326
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,449
It should be able to decrypt
the genetic database.

327
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,285
Are you there?

328
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:51,866
What if I told you
that I wanted you to buy me out?

329
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:55,956
That I'd be willing to sell you
the breadth of my assets,

330
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:58,537
my contacts,

331
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:03,922
all the Rambaldi artefacts I've acquired
over the last 30 years. Everything.

332
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:08,010
I'd say that either you're setting me up
to be killed,

333
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,217
or I underestimated
your love for your wife.

334
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:16,556
I'm going back to Tuscany to see Emily.

335
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:20,184
The house is safe.
Emily's meeting me there.

336
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:23,612
I'll bring the database with me.
You can pick it up from me there.

337
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:27,985
I can't blame Emily. She's right.

338
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,866
I want out.

339
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:37,452
This document guarantees

340
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:41,792
that the Justice Department will not pursue
the death penalty for your husband.

341
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:45,299
Take a few minutes to read it
before you sign.

342
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:49,176
I don't need to.

343
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:06,486
You understand you're gonna have to wear
a wire? The operation's being drawn up.

344
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:11,569
The raid will be dangerous, but
you're gonna be fine. We will protect you.

345
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:12,777
Sydney.

346
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:18,126
I know I've disappointed you.

347
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:21,497
That I chose to stay with Arvin,

348
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:30,587
that I came here asking you
to... show mercy for a man who...

349
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,089
took so much away from you.

350
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:39,974
You're in an impossible situation.

351
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:45,854
At your funeral...

352
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,993
I said that I've always thought of you
as my real mother.

353
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,954
I meant it.

354
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:25,607
He's going to know.

355
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:29,067
It's odd, I feel like I'm talking to myself.

356
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:34,446
It's comforting to know
that you're out there listening.

357
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,998
Oh, God, I think he's here.

358
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:14,325
The genetic database is in a safe
in the study. It's just off to the left.

359
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:19,571
- That's the combination.
- Are you certain about this?

360
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,991
Yeah.

361
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,836
I'm sorry.

362
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:37,766
There's no point in my continuing
if you're not with me.

363
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:38,764
We're on.

364
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:42,101
You've said that before.

365
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:50,983
- It's different this time.
- What changed so much in one day?

366
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:52,483
Everything.

367
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:57,449
When we hear Emily say she's going
to the wine cellar, we move in. Let's go.

368
00:33:57,537 --> 00:34:02,780
The things you've done.
There's just been too much suffering.

369
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:06,624
You have every right not to believe me.

370
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:10,711
But it doesn't matter. You will.

371
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,505
I will never leave you again.

372
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:24,474
Arvin, I'm here to say goodbye.

373
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:35,241
Emily...

374
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:40,236
Remember how it felt when I found you on
the beach and I told you that it was over?

375
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:42,828
Arvin...

376
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:46,285
All that matters is this,
what we have between us.

377
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:49,378
- Just stop.
- That no one else is a part of.

378
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:52,714
Oh, God, please, just stop.

379
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:17,444
We've lost the signal.
Sloane may have found the wire.

380
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:20,950
The CIA's been listening.

381
00:35:23,665 --> 00:35:26,582
They're here.

382
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:31,419
We have to go.

383
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:41,508
It doesn't matter.

384
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,308
All I need to know right now
is whether you want to come with me.

385
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:51,725
- Come with you?
- If you don't want to, I'll understand.

386
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:57,987
But, Emily, please... please,
you have to make your mind up right now.

387
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:05,202
Now!

388
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,340
Yes. I will.

389
00:36:23,808 --> 00:36:25,006
Sloane!

390
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:39,353
- Come on.
- Go!

391
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:45,745
- I have the disk ready for extraction.
- Copy that.

392
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,373
They're in some kind of tunnel.
It starts to the east.

393
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:02,505
- Check outside to see where it leads.
- Copy. On my way.

394
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:22,156
Freeze! Don't move!

395
00:38:58,171 --> 00:38:59,416
Go, go, go.

396
00:39:18,566 --> 00:39:21,236
Do you have the disk?

397
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:26,959
Syd?

398
00:40:27,052 --> 00:40:28,712
You OK?

399
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:36,426
I don't want to talk. Not now.

400
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:51,732
- Is that your phone?
- Uh-uh. Yours?

401
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:53,902
No.

402
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:11,804
- What is that?
- My mother's earrings.

403
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:18,097
- I thought they were checked.
- They were.

404
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:22,178
Wait. It's repeating a pattern.

405
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:25,559
- Dash-dot-dash.
- That's a K. Definitely Morse code.

406
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,532
- That's an E. That's a T.
- Another T.

407
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,326
It's encoded.

408
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:49,208
What are you doing?

409
00:42:35,555 --> 00:42:37,298
Bad robot!
