1
00:00:01,141 --> 00:00:03,291
For starters,
my name isn't Michael Vaughn.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,940
Langley believes
Vaughn may be a double agent.

3
00:00:08,578 --> 00:00:11,028
They think the crash
may have been an extraction.

4
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:13,429
Gordon Dean,
Office of Special Investigations.

5
00:00:13,643 --> 00:00:15,043
My fiance was just abducted.

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,619
Perhaps.
That's what we're trying to determine.

7
00:00:17,704 --> 00:00:18,704
I want the truth.

8
00:00:18,758 --> 00:00:20,458
7 years ago, a woman came to me,

9
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:22,701
said that her father
had been involved in a project,

10
00:00:22,702 --> 00:00:25,143
something that people
had gone to great lengths to cover up.

11
00:00:25,144 --> 00:00:26,460
Said it was called Prophet Five.

12
00:00:26,488 --> 00:00:29,841
This man we're meeting, Renée and I
have been trying to find him for years.

13
00:00:29,887 --> 00:00:31,230
Renée who? Who is this woman?

14
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:32,517
- Renée Rienne.
- Vaughn.

15
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,530
The Raven, Renée Rienne.

16
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:38,954
She's wanted for the assassination
of the Turkish Interior Minister in 2001

17
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:42,166
and for the murders of
3 C.I.A. agents stationed in Serbia.

18
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:44,578
Vaughn's movements track with hers.

19
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,651
I am now officially classifying him
a fugitive

20
00:00:47,652 --> 00:00:49,280
and your daughter an accomplice.

21
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,279
You'll be notified
when they've been apprehended.

22
00:00:52,392 --> 00:00:54,392
What on earth prompted you
to risk your own life,

23
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:56,269
not to mention
your professional integrity?

24
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,520
Dad, Vaughn and I,
we're having a baby.

25
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,769
I want to know about Prophet 5.

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,152
It seemed to be some sort

27
00:01:03,153 --> 00:01:05,520
of advanced genetics
500 years ahead of its time.

28
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:09,269
When they know you're onto it,
they'll stop at nothing to silence you.

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,530
You're a hard person to find.

30
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:22,617
But if I can do it, so can they.

31
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:25,381
I know who you are, Renée.

32
00:01:31,954 --> 00:01:33,704
It's no accident you found me here.

33
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:38,432
The people who killed Vaughn...
they own this place.

34
00:01:40,703 --> 00:01:42,603
There's an operation center in the back.

35
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:43,816
I haven't gotten in yet,

36
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,969
but judging the way
that man over there is looking at us,

37
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:50,329
you just blew my cover.

38
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:54,869
You should go.

39
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,280
- Walk out, slowly.
- What about you?

40
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:02,029
I didn't spend 3 months
getting in the place to just walk away.

41
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:05,579
We can access their servers.

42
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:08,315
That might give me a window
into their operation.

43
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:10,233
I'm going there.

44
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:12,604
I'm coming with you.

45
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:29,099
You know the rules.
You're not supposed to be back here.

46
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,783
You're gonna want to step aside now.

47
00:02:32,796 --> 00:02:35,846
Sexy. So I'm bein' threatened
by a waif and a pregnant chick.

48
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:41,048
Feeling sexy now?

49
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:46,297
Get up.

50
00:03:00,798 --> 00:03:02,148
The data's being destroyed.

51
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,510
- I can't stop it.
- Me, neither.

52
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
We got it.

53
00:03:21,874 --> 00:03:23,564
It doesn't look like it's been fried.

54
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:25,165
The data should still be intact.

55
00:03:25,749 --> 00:03:26,749
Probably encrypted.

56
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,876
It won't be a problem.
I don't know if Vaughn ever mentioned,

57
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:33,001
but I work with a genius.

58
00:03:33,002 --> 00:03:35,562
He'll be able to crack the encryption.
I'll upload it for you.

59
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:37,863
Here, take this. It's a secure line.

60
00:03:38,312 --> 00:03:40,212
Dial 9, wait for the tone, dial 8-1-6.

61
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:43,651
You're not bringing this back
to the C.I.A.

62
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:46,187
No, we're an off-the-books division.
It's different.

63
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:47,638
Not to me. I don't know them.

64
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:49,626
I do. You can trust them.

65
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,300
Who says I trust you?

66
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:55,337
Good point.

67
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,400
What did Michael tell you about me?

68
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:02,751
Not that much. Just that
you've been working with him for years,

69
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:07,171
and you were the one
who told him about Prophet 5.

70
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,147
I understand why you're reluctant.

71
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:14,084
I mean, you're number eight
on the C.I.A.'S most wanted list.

72
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:16,835
I get it, but you have to understand,

73
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,595
these people killed my fiancé...

74
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:22,270
the father of my child.

75
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,798
I'm gonna enlist

76
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:26,073
every resource available
to immobilize them,

77
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:29,030
and if that means that this is
the last time you and I see each other,

78
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:30,031
that is fine by me.

79
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:31,731
Just...

80
00:04:32,432 --> 00:04:33,869
tell me how you wanna do it.

81
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:37,807
- Number 8?
- Yes.

82
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:43,296
I'm slipping. I used to be number 6.

83
00:04:46,782 --> 00:04:48,882
You're exactly like
Michael said you were.

84
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:53,637
Fine.

85
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:56,393
Do it your way. Give me the phone.

86
00:04:58,533 --> 00:04:59,783
You called him "Michael".

87
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:01,219
Yeah.

88
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:06,218
Don't worry.

89
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:08,683
He was crazy about you.

90
00:05:17,406 --> 00:05:20,106
- How've you been feeling?
- Oh, good.

91
00:05:20,596 --> 00:05:23,219
The morning sickness is gone,
and my energy's back, so...

92
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,120
Right on schedule. That's normal
for the second trimester.

93
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:28,153
How was your trip?

94
00:05:28,254 --> 00:05:30,071
London, right? Do any shopping?

95
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:32,594
Oh, it was more of
a business trip, actually.

96
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,720
I had to meet
with one of my fiancé's old friends.

97
00:05:36,596 --> 00:05:38,846
What about exercise,
are you keeping active?

98
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:43,035
My job is still pretty demanding.

99
00:05:43,597 --> 00:05:44,597
That's great.

100
00:05:44,907 --> 00:05:47,857
Doctors used to tell pregnant women
to stay off their feet.

101
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,560
You're pregnant. You're not sick.

102
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,284
As long as you feel comfortable,

103
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,185
you just keep doing what you're doing.

104
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:54,995
Let's take a look, shall we?

105
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,920
Should I ask the nurse to bring in
anyone from the waiting room?

106
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,360
No, I came alone.

107
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,728
You know, Sydney...

108
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:11,726
You should try.

109
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:15,454
Okay, let's see how we're doing.

110
00:06:22,976 --> 00:06:24,153
And there we go.

111
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:26,576
That's your baby.

112
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:35,766
That's the head,
the spine and that pulse...

113
00:06:37,992 --> 00:06:40,042
Look at its little heart.

114
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:45,628
Mm-hmm. You got an active one there...
just like mommy.

115
00:06:50,616 --> 00:06:52,266
Everything looks great.

116
00:06:57,804 --> 00:06:59,504
And I will see you in a few weeks.

117
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:02,494
This is the man that killed Vaughn.

118
00:08:02,868 --> 00:08:04,068
His name is Ivan Curtis.

119
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:06,806
He ran operations for
a corporate security firm out of Dublin

120
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:10,307
until 3 years ago when
European Aviation records say he died

121
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,740
in a private plane crash.

122
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,305
It's starting to fit a pattern.

123
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:15,506
Gordon Dean was presumed dead
two years ago.

124
00:08:15,557 --> 00:08:17,362
Both of the men
who we know were involved--

125
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:18,517
From what we've learned,

126
00:08:18,554 --> 00:08:21,493
their operation has been in place
for 30 years without being detected.

127
00:08:21,494 --> 00:08:22,670
Whoever these people are,

128
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:24,928
they must have access
to high level resources.

129
00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:26,617
I'm leaving tonight for Washington.

130
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:28,427
Ahern has some names for me to consider.

131
00:08:28,428 --> 00:08:30,378
Do you still think that's a good idea...

132
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:33,107
bringing in a new agent now,
someone we don't know?

133
00:08:34,867 --> 00:08:37,481
We're down a man,
and I trust Ahern's recommendation

134
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:38,517
without reservation.

135
00:08:38,545 --> 00:08:40,356
In the meantime,
Curtis has been in London.

136
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:41,962
Have Marshall create a facial profile

137
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:44,365
so we can run him
against their surveillance networks.

138
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:46,741
So Sydney said she got this footage
from a contact.

139
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:48,442
What do we know about this person?

140
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:50,055
She didn't say.

141
00:09:07,057 --> 00:09:08,757
- Yeah. Hello?
- It's me.

142
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,058
I've been going over
the footage from London.

143
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,307
I think I found something.

144
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:14,308
Hmm. I'd love to, baby, but I'm married.

145
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:15,967
Oh, Marshall, wake up. Marshall.

146
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,180
I'm up.

147
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,520
I'm up, I'm up. Sorry. Uh... Syd?

148
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,880
I need you to pull up
the surveillance footage from London.

149
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,030
Okay, uh, gimme a sec.

150
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:29,973
You been at this all night?

151
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:31,494
Are you looking at the footage?

152
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:32,795
Hold on. Gimme just a sec.

153
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:39,019
Okay, now I am. What am I lookin' for?

154
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:42,267
Time index 12-40.
Curtis is dialing a number.

155
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:44,594
- Can you enhance it?
- See what I can do.

156
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:46,568
That looks like a 4.

157
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:52,869
That looks like a 3.
No, it might be a 5.

158
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,920
You know what? I'll run it against
an Echelon call archive. I'll use the 5.

159
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:01,981
I've got the audio. Patching it through.

160
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:07,917
They're ordering takeout, Marshall.

161
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:12,068
Right. Sorry. Must be the 3. All right,
got audio. Patching it through.

162
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:14,935
- Allo?
- Any news on my package?

163
00:10:14,977 --> 00:10:16,592
Not yet. I'm still workin' on it.

164
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,223
I'm growing impatient. If this
is becoming a problem for you...

165
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:21,033
I haven't disappointed you yet, have I?

166
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:22,834
25 more kilos. I'll have it for you.

167
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:25,404
Fine. I'll be there to pick it up.
Don't let me down.

168
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:26,522
Looks like we got our guy.

169
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:28,537
Who was Curtis talking to?
Can you run a trace?

170
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:29,538
Yeah. Um...

171
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,598
Uh, actually,
it's not just the server, Bob.

172
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,709
You need to run
a diagnostic on the entire network.

173
00:10:35,747 --> 00:10:36,897
What?

174
00:10:36,898 --> 00:10:38,098
Can you hold on one sec?

175
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:41,384
Who's Bob?
I never heard you mention Bob.

176
00:10:41,398 --> 00:10:44,898
Yeah, but you know Bob. Bobby.
He works in the... corner.

177
00:10:45,524 --> 00:10:48,824
Uh, he brings in the...
...the dark roast... coffee.

178
00:10:53,335 --> 00:10:54,585
I'm not having an affair.

179
00:10:54,962 --> 00:10:58,712
I know you're not having an affair.
I just don't want you to wake Mitchell.

180
00:10:59,146 --> 00:11:01,146
- Oh, okay
- Okay.

181
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:09,696
You, uh, you think
she believed me, right?

182
00:11:09,897 --> 00:11:11,697
Yeah, Marshall. I think you're okay.

183
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,335
Good. I'll run a trace on that call.

184
00:11:13,336 --> 00:11:14,336
Okay.

185
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:23,136
It belongs to a Heinrich Roemer.
Where do I know that name from?

186
00:11:42,023 --> 00:11:43,023
You're beautiful.

187
00:11:46,128 --> 00:11:47,894
What you must be going through...

188
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,164
One of the men responsible,

189
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:56,530
Ivan Curtis,

190
00:11:57,233 --> 00:12:00,533
he's been in contact
with an arms dealer. Heinrich Roemer.

191
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:04,192
According to SD-6 files,
you've worked with him.

192
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:08,881
Yes, he supplied arms
to several SD cells.

193
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:13,131
Curtis is planning a meet with Roemer.
We don't know when.

194
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,794
We need to locate
Roemer's base of operations,

195
00:12:15,795 --> 00:12:17,445
get inside, wire it with cameras.

196
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:20,602
So you can monitor
him and wait for Curtis

197
00:12:20,603 --> 00:12:22,131
to make contact. I understand.

198
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:25,581
This is your first lead, isn't it,
Sydney?

199
00:12:29,606 --> 00:12:33,306
Yeah. Look, I know how important
this is to you,

200
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:38,134
but revenge is ultimately
a hollow pursuit, Sydney.

201
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,807
This isn't about revenge.

202
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:42,708
They know who I am,
they know where I work,

203
00:12:43,608 --> 00:12:46,208
and as long as they're out there,
I am not safe.

204
00:12:47,356 --> 00:12:48,356
Okay.

205
00:12:49,732 --> 00:12:51,382
Roemer operates out of Amsterdam.

206
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:54,758
Tactical entry is out of the question.

207
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:56,559
Roemer is paranoid about security.

208
00:12:57,608 --> 00:12:59,508
You'll have to go in posing as buyers.

209
00:13:00,358 --> 00:13:02,958
There's a vending machine on Ballister,
near Amstel.

210
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:05,119
Enter the sequence 5-1-0-9-4.

211
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:10,169
Shortly thereafter, you'll be contacted.

212
00:13:10,985 --> 00:13:13,185
Then all you need
are the proper bona fides.

213
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:20,684
Roemer's security system
is capable of detecting bugs.

214
00:13:20,857 --> 00:13:24,007
Your best option is to piggy-back off
his closed circuit feeds.

215
00:13:32,297 --> 00:13:33,297
Right jacket pocket.

216
00:13:37,171 --> 00:13:38,271
Keep it. A small gift.

217
00:13:40,857 --> 00:13:41,857
Follow me.

218
00:13:50,798 --> 00:13:53,172
Okay. I'm ready to hack
into their surveillance system.

219
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:54,952
You'll just need a directed RF pulse

220
00:13:54,953 --> 00:13:57,323
from your wristwatch
for each interior camera.

221
00:13:57,595 --> 00:13:59,419
Gentlemen. Welcome.

222
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,595
Heinrich Roemer.

223
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,999
Jalin Khamisi.

224
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,820
It's my pleasure.

225
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:08,005
Oh. Sorry.

226
00:14:08,378 --> 00:14:09,701
My business manager

227
00:14:10,502 --> 00:14:11,578
Isaac Malcolm.

228
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:14,132
Have a seat.

229
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,255
So...

230
00:14:18,253 --> 00:14:20,303
who do I have to thank
for your business?

231
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:21,816
A mutual friend. Jean Briault.

232
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,570
We worked together in Montreal.
He spoke highly of you.

233
00:14:27,505 --> 00:14:29,955
Jean Briault.
I haven't heard that name in years.

234
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,803
He was a good man.
It is a pity what happened.

235
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,343
Well, what can I do for you?

236
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,100
"3,000 kalashnikov rifles,

237
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:48,567
75-man portable shoulder-fired
stinger missiles,

238
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:52,073
m77 anti-personnel mines."

239
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:57,175
What exactly would you do
with a purchase this large?

240
00:14:57,524 --> 00:14:59,724
I intend to secure
some beachfront property.

241
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:09,762
An order of this size...
...it won't be easy.

242
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,400
I couldn't do it for less than,
say... $5 million.

243
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,199
Uh, Mr. Khamisi will forward
an additional 20%

244
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:24,811
if you can complete delivery
by... Friday.

245
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:28,424
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, Mr. Khamisi.

246
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,960
- I'm sorry.
- It's no matter.

247
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:33,933
No, it is, and it's my fault.

248
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:35,815
Do you have someplace I can clean up?

249
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:38,488
He'll show you the way.

250
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:39,903
Thank you.

251
00:15:45,024 --> 00:15:47,324
Outrigger, camera one is up,
connection solid.

252
00:15:58,775 --> 00:15:59,825
Camera two is online.

253
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,950
- How are the video signals?
- Good.

254
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,542
Outrigger, we've got company.

255
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:12,777
It's Curtis.

256
00:16:13,878 --> 00:16:15,441
He's here. You gotta move now.

257
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:18,099
No. I know what you're thinking.
Hold your position.

258
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:24,998
Mr Roemer wasn't expecting you
until tonight.

259
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:26,949
Plans change. I took an earlier flight.

260
00:16:27,437 --> 00:16:29,087
I assume that won't be a problem.

261
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:31,563
Of course not.
I'll let him know you're here.

262
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:41,012
I take payment via wire.

263
00:16:41,374 --> 00:16:43,174
Currency is too easy to counterfeit.

264
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:44,186
Of course.

265
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:46,376
Curtis.

266
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,061
Yeah.

267
00:16:48,062 --> 00:16:51,112
If you'll excuse me,
just a small matter I need to attend to.

268
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,975
Please
make sure our guest is comfortable.

269
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,090
Mr Curtis. Good to see you.

270
00:17:03,374 --> 00:17:04,374
Where's my package?

271
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,940
Well, your item arrived today.

272
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:08,837
25 kilos of nuridium as promised.

273
00:17:10,251 --> 00:17:12,501
Which leaves us
just a matter of the payment.

274
00:17:14,253 --> 00:17:15,253
Sure thing.

275
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:28,999
Thank you.

276
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:44,815
Weiss is in trouble.

277
00:17:52,631 --> 00:17:53,814
I'm on it.

278
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:54,815
Thanks.

279
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,050
Come on. We gotta go.

280
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:07,941
Need a ride?

281
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:16,065
Get up!

282
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:23,276
Would you take it easy?

283
00:18:23,316 --> 00:18:24,316
Shut up.

284
00:18:29,502 --> 00:18:31,626
Hey, listen, Syd,
Dixon and I can handle this.

285
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:32,927
No, I'm gonna talk to him.

286
00:18:35,755 --> 00:18:38,305
All right, fine.
I'll be right here if you need me.

287
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:45,866
Can we have a minute?

288
00:18:52,004 --> 00:18:53,170
Do you recognize me?

289
00:18:54,171 --> 00:18:55,204
No.

290
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:59,276
Four months ago,
you murdered a man... Michael Vaughn.

291
00:19:00,316 --> 00:19:01,583
Do you remember?

292
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,248
I do.

293
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:05,566
I was there.

294
00:19:07,176 --> 00:19:09,876
It'll be burned into my memory
for the rest of my life

295
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,850
as the day my child lost its father.

296
00:19:15,365 --> 00:19:17,665
So you can imagine
what I'd like to do to you.

297
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:21,227
Lucky for you,
there someone I want even more.

298
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:24,962
Tell me where I can find Gordon Dean.

299
00:19:26,678 --> 00:19:28,828
Is this whole routine
supposed to scare me?

300
00:19:29,237 --> 00:19:30,387
I do this for a living.

301
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:34,613
It's a funny thing about pregnancy.

302
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:36,677
Hormones.

303
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:40,989
I woke up today...

304
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,815
feeling pretty hormonal.

305
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:50,689
I'm gonna give you another chance.

306
00:19:55,738 --> 00:19:56,788
Where is Gordon Dean?

307
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:06,829
Nuridium. That's some
pretty nasty stuff. That's for sure.

308
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:10,677
Uh, all right.
Go ahead. Give me the lot number.

309
00:20:10,678 --> 00:20:11,678
"6-6-4-R-T-4-5-6-9."

310
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,050
Yeah, NASA's been experimenting
with nuridium

311
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,551
as a long-term power source
for deep space probes.

312
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:22,425
Problem is, it's inherently unstable.

313
00:20:22,426 --> 00:20:24,926
It's most easily suited
as a high-yield explosive.

314
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:26,988
You know, I'm talkin' megaton here.

315
00:20:26,989 --> 00:20:29,989
Some big bang, kinda crazy badass stuff.

316
00:20:30,051 --> 00:20:32,501
But, uh, wait a minute. RT4569?

317
00:20:33,113 --> 00:20:34,237
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

318
00:20:34,238 --> 00:20:35,488
Yes, Marshall.

319
00:20:36,177 --> 00:20:38,627
You have no idea
what you're getting involved in.

320
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:40,029
Why don't you enlighten me?

321
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:41,302
You wanna know the truth?

322
00:20:42,677 --> 00:20:43,677
The truth is

323
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:46,614
you're better off not knowing.

324
00:20:51,676 --> 00:20:52,676
We need to talk.

325
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:00,008
Six canisters of nuridium disappeared

326
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,181
from a Russian processing plant
last month

327
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,363
from the same lot
as the one we just recovered.

328
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,129
The phone call between Curtis and Roemer

329
00:21:06,157 --> 00:21:08,016
they talked about
the rest of the shipment.

330
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:10,288
We think that Curtis already has
the other canisters.

331
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:14,754
Our options here are limited, Syd.

332
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:18,180
But we think if we let him go,
there's a really good chance

333
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:20,531
that he'll lead us
to the rest of the nuridium.

334
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:21,791
You wanna let him go.

335
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:23,615
We'll make him believe he's escaped.

336
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,222
No. We can't risk losing him.

337
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,627
The risks will be minimal.

338
00:21:26,628 --> 00:21:28,116
We just need more time to break him.

339
00:21:28,144 --> 00:21:29,562
We don't have more time.

340
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,340
With that much nuridium,
we may be looking at Hiroshima times 50.

341
00:21:37,178 --> 00:21:39,978
We're talking about
releasing the man who killed Vaughn.

342
00:21:52,663 --> 00:21:53,713
Water?

343
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:56,213
Thank you.

344
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,330
We know about the nuridium.

345
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,292
I see.

346
00:22:08,605 --> 00:22:11,455
Possession of nuridium
is considered an act of terrorism,

347
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,180
based on which
we can lock you away indefinitely.

348
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:17,505
No formal charges, no trial.

349
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,270
But right now
that does neither of us any good.

350
00:22:20,857 --> 00:22:22,957
Tell us
where the rest of the nuridium is,

351
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:25,906
what you intend to do with it,
and we'll cut you a deal.

352
00:22:30,312 --> 00:22:31,461
I want immunity...

353
00:22:32,962 --> 00:22:34,062
for everything

354
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:36,921
the nuridium and killing Michael Vaughn.

355
00:22:42,857 --> 00:22:44,157
You'd do it, wouldn't you?

356
00:22:47,043 --> 00:22:48,043
You'd have to.

357
00:22:53,545 --> 00:22:55,145
Well, I'll save you the trouble.

358
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,255
No deal.

359
00:22:58,056 --> 00:22:59,220
I'm not talking.

360
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:04,058
Sorry, baby.

361
00:23:05,995 --> 00:23:08,695
Daddy just went snooping
where he shouldn't have gone.

362
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,244
Did he drink enough?

363
00:23:24,358 --> 00:23:25,621
Yeah.

364
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:27,252
I'd say we've got about two hours

365
00:23:27,253 --> 00:23:29,772
before the tracking serum
enters his bloodstream.

366
00:23:29,995 --> 00:23:31,745
All right, I'll set up the scanner.

367
00:23:40,746 --> 00:23:42,560
That stuff will poison you, you know.

368
00:23:43,561 --> 00:23:44,746
Liberal rag.

369
00:23:47,097 --> 00:23:48,947
Coffee's not too good for you either.

370
00:23:50,657 --> 00:23:51,907
I think I found your man.

371
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,723
Ouider, like you asked,
but fully documented.

372
00:23:55,285 --> 00:23:56,685
No family, no entanglements.

373
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,360
Just off a 4-year tour
with the special ops.

374
00:24:03,721 --> 00:24:04,762
I know.

375
00:24:05,463 --> 00:24:07,221
I assume you can deal with that.

376
00:24:09,422 --> 00:24:11,372
They say he also has a bit of a temper.

377
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:29,062
Seriously, something has to be done
about your breath.

378
00:24:29,741 --> 00:24:30,991
Oh, yeah? How about this?

379
00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:36,366
Jackass.

380
00:24:44,055 --> 00:24:45,055
Thomas Grace?

381
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,119
Who wants to know?

382
00:24:49,616 --> 00:24:50,616
Let's take a walk.

383
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:56,168
Did you know
that we have astronaut ice cream here?

384
00:24:56,804 --> 00:25:00,404
The neapolitan is a little nasty,
but apparently it lasts for centuries.

385
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,620
- Still nothing?
- Nothing.

386
00:25:08,181 --> 00:25:10,299
You know, how quickly the isotope
is absorbed

387
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,865
depends on this guy's metabolism.

388
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:13,416
It's been two and a half hours.

389
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,080
It's going to hit, Syd. Trust me.

390
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:23,741
All right, you know what?
I can't wait with this any longer.

391
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,130
I've been offered a promotion

392
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:29,999
to coordinate
the covert ops for the N.S.C.,

393
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,641
and I've known about it for a week.

394
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:34,702
I asked your father not to tell you
'cause I wanted to tell you myself,

395
00:25:34,721 --> 00:25:36,572
but there hasn't been
a really great time...

396
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:38,422
Wait a minute. In D.C.?

397
00:25:38,932 --> 00:25:40,732
Yeah. Steps away from the President.

398
00:25:43,305 --> 00:25:44,305
Well, that's great

399
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:48,056
That's good news.

400
00:25:53,244 --> 00:25:54,244
I'm gonna miss you.

401
00:25:56,933 --> 00:26:00,000
But I'm really, really happy for you.

402
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,909
- I can't do it.
- Weiss...

403
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:10,533
No, I can't do it. Come on, Syd.

404
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:14,619
Vaughn, Nadia. I mean,
to leave now just doesn't seem right.

405
00:26:14,994 --> 00:26:17,992
Listen to what you're saying.
Steps away from the President.

406
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:18,993
Oh, I know.

407
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:21,059
You can't say no to that.

408
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,721
Okay, we got a signal on Curtis.

409
00:26:30,764 --> 00:26:31,869
Where is he?

410
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,620
I can't tell. It's not pinpointing.

411
00:26:36,684 --> 00:26:38,584
That's because he's not on the ground.

412
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,183
All right, during the hivernal equinox,

413
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,242
you can actually
balance an egg on its end.

414
00:26:44,243 --> 00:26:45,593
No, you can't. It's a myth.

415
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,682
No, it's not.

416
00:26:46,683 --> 00:26:48,708
It has something to do
with the Earth's axis

417
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:50,058
and the alignment of the sun.

418
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:51,772
Trust me. I googled it.

419
00:26:51,807 --> 00:26:55,457
Yeah, okay, just like water swirls
the other way in toilets in Australia?

420
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,360
- It does.
- Hello.

421
00:27:00,784 --> 00:27:03,084
Guys, I'm gonna take this.
I'll be right back.

422
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:08,861
Mr Curtis, what can I do for you?

423
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:11,133
Let Dean know we are on our way.

424
00:27:11,284 --> 00:27:12,784
We've got the device on board,

425
00:27:12,785 --> 00:27:16,185
but I am going to need the analysis team
to meet us at the airfield.

426
00:27:16,221 --> 00:27:17,221
Of course.

427
00:27:17,784 --> 00:27:19,734
We're 200 miles out. Right on schedule.

428
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:38,618
At 1700 hours,
Ivan Curtis boarded a private jet.

429
00:27:38,637 --> 00:27:40,778
Marshall pulled the cargo manifests
from Schiphol.

430
00:27:40,796 --> 00:27:41,801
Curtis loaded

431
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:43,723
several oversized containers
onto the plane.

432
00:27:43,724 --> 00:27:45,033
He's transporting the weapon.

433
00:27:45,034 --> 00:27:47,741
The flight plan indicates
their final destination is Pyongyang.

434
00:27:47,778 --> 00:27:49,553
The flight was granted
diplomatic immunity.

435
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:51,336
Diplomatic immunity?
How's that possible?

436
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,660
We're still exploring that.

437
00:27:52,661 --> 00:27:54,778
We can't just let these guys
fly to North Korea.

438
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,562
There's gotta be something we can do.

439
00:27:57,162 --> 00:27:58,162
Maybe there is.

440
00:28:07,785 --> 00:28:08,935
We're just about there.

441
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:34,388
What's their current position?
Do we have an E.T.A. for rendezvous?

442
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,050
Okay, the docking point is 2 miles out.

443
00:28:37,226 --> 00:28:38,526
Final approach for hookup.

444
00:28:38,705 --> 00:28:40,910
Is there any indication
they've been detected?

445
00:28:40,911 --> 00:28:42,161
No. A.T.C.'s still blind.

446
00:28:42,473 --> 00:28:43,509
And I was able to jam

447
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,073
the airliner's
traffic collision avoidance system.

448
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,598
They don't know we're coming.

449
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,634
Good. Keep me posted.

450
00:28:48,635 --> 00:28:51,099
I want to know the second
that plane is secured.

451
00:28:59,974 --> 00:29:00,974
Okay.

452
00:29:45,975 --> 00:29:47,325
Docking tube's pressurized.

453
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:12,911
Yes?

454
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:14,662
Rendezvous complete. They're onboard.

455
00:30:14,663 --> 00:30:15,663
Good. Thank you.

456
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,387
- Flinkman.
- Hey, it's me.

457
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,476
Oh, yeah, I know.
I gave you your own ringtone.

458
00:30:33,477 --> 00:30:34,727
So did you find the bomb?

459
00:30:34,788 --> 00:30:36,412
I'm standing right in front of it.

460
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:38,792
Okay, great. Well, what do you see?
Tell me about it.

461
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,266
It's about 8 feet by 3 feet.

462
00:30:44,663 --> 00:30:46,463
There's a hose running alongside it.

463
00:30:46,493 --> 00:30:48,643
Looks like it's feeding the nuridium
into the panel.

464
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:50,200
Okay, you need to access that panel.

465
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:51,815
Can you get to it? Can you open it?

466
00:30:51,862 --> 00:30:53,280
Let me see. Just give me a sec.

467
00:30:56,352 --> 00:30:57,502
Three Tango. On my go.

468
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,290
Three, two... one.

469
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:22,602
Go, go, go, go. Oh, you know what?

470
00:31:22,603 --> 00:31:25,604
There should be a detonator attached
to the regulator. Do you see that?

471
00:31:25,605 --> 00:31:26,655
Okay. I don't see it.

472
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:29,538
Well, it has to be there,
because without a detonator,

473
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:31,353
there's no detonation.
That's how it works.

474
00:31:31,354 --> 00:31:33,350
Fine. I'm just telling you,
it's not here.

475
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:35,101
Well, Syd, it has to be there, okay?

476
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:37,352
Because there is no bomb
without a detonator.

477
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,326
Marshall...

478
00:31:53,327 --> 00:31:54,690
I don't think it's a bomb.

479
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,590
I don't believe
you have a boarding pass.

480
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:12,225
Go ahead. Shoot me.

481
00:32:13,728 --> 00:32:15,805
But if you do,
there's a damn good chance

482
00:32:15,806 --> 00:32:18,178
my hand will slip
and I'll cut this connection.

483
00:32:21,727 --> 00:32:24,349
Whoever this guy is,
he's obviously pretty important to you.

484
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,600
It'd be a shame
if something happened to him.

485
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,489
Step away from the container.

486
00:32:31,664 --> 00:32:32,664
I don't think so.

487
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:34,041
Dixon, cover me!

488
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,541
You have no idea
what you've gotten yourself into.

489
00:32:54,978 --> 00:32:55,978
I'll ask you once,

490
00:32:57,103 --> 00:32:59,303
and if you don't answer me,
I will cut this.

491
00:33:00,977 --> 00:33:02,227
Who is Dean working with?

492
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:04,889
Who gave the order
to kill Michael Vaughn?

493
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:07,929
Even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

494
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:11,789
Humor me.

495
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:38,841
Going in the cockpit.

496
00:33:48,355 --> 00:33:49,955
- I got him. Take him.
- Got it.

497
00:34:05,852 --> 00:34:07,102
What are you waiting for?

498
00:34:12,976 --> 00:34:15,276
Turn around, on your knees.
I'm taking you in.

499
00:34:17,477 --> 00:34:18,517
Then...

500
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:20,677
you might as well kill me.

501
00:34:21,412 --> 00:34:23,262
I won't survive the night in custody.

502
00:34:23,671 --> 00:34:26,040
If you're willing to cooperate,
we can protect you.

503
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,041
No.

504
00:34:27,663 --> 00:34:28,663
You have no idea.

505
00:34:30,725 --> 00:34:31,925
- These people...
- Who?

506
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:47,476
Our initial assumptions were wrong.

507
00:34:47,477 --> 00:34:49,773
The nuridium
wasn't being utilized as an explosive.

508
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,477
We believe it was used
to power a cryogenic chamber.

509
00:34:53,914 --> 00:34:55,538
You mean freezing people, cryogenics?

510
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:57,939
Sort of.
It's usually done with liquid nitrogen,

511
00:34:58,101 --> 00:35:00,251
but this is like
next-gen cryopreservation.

512
00:35:00,413 --> 00:35:02,363
I mean, whoever this person is or was...

513
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,788
they probably died
of a terminal illness,

514
00:35:05,789 --> 00:35:07,539
and they're using this container to

515
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:09,567
preserve the corpse
until a treatment is found.

516
00:35:09,604 --> 00:35:10,959
Of course, the notion that anyone

517
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,013
can ever actually be revived--
complete fiction.

518
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,262
Believe me, I've tried.

519
00:35:15,477 --> 00:35:16,677
Have we I.D.'ed the body?

520
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,351
Not yet. The container is currently
in D.S.R. Custody.

521
00:35:19,352 --> 00:35:22,227
They'll forward us the forensic analysis
as soon as it's complete.

522
00:35:22,228 --> 00:35:25,601
An evidence team scoured the plane
for anything that might be of value,

523
00:35:25,602 --> 00:35:27,605
but I'm not expecting anything
to come of it.

524
00:35:27,606 --> 00:35:29,506
For now, we've done everything we can.

525
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:31,605
We'll just have to wait for the reports.

526
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,041
Sydney...

527
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,580
We lost our only lead on Gordon Dean.

528
00:36:03,353 --> 00:36:05,103
I'm not sure if I can do this, dad.

529
00:36:05,856 --> 00:36:07,956
- We'll get another lead.
- It's not that.

530
00:36:11,165 --> 00:36:12,365
It's everything. It's...

531
00:36:18,978 --> 00:36:20,378
It's hard being without him.

532
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,540
I saw the baby's heartbeat
for the first time the other day.

533
00:36:35,603 --> 00:36:36,603
I was by myself.

534
00:36:42,843 --> 00:36:43,915
It's not fair.

535
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:45,216
He should have been there.

536
00:36:50,604 --> 00:36:51,604
I'm here.

537
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:55,791
How can I help?

538
00:37:00,729 --> 00:37:03,029
My next doctor's appointment's
in a few weeks.

539
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:06,782
Would you go with me?

540
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:10,619
Sweetheart, of course I will.

541
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:20,916
Sydney...

542
00:37:22,733 --> 00:37:23,783
You're gonna be okay.

543
00:37:26,983 --> 00:37:28,120
Yeah.

544
00:37:31,122 --> 00:37:32,127
Yeah.

545
00:37:59,607 --> 00:38:01,157
Hey, how you doing? Eric Weiss.

546
00:38:02,168 --> 00:38:03,518
- Tom Grace.
- Hi, Tom.

547
00:38:05,607 --> 00:38:08,707
Uh, listen, this desk
isn't exactly an ideal location for you.

548
00:38:08,777 --> 00:38:11,607
It's, you know,
right under the air conditioning vent,

549
00:38:11,608 --> 00:38:13,708
and there's actually
a wobble in the desk.

550
00:38:16,731 --> 00:38:17,731
You know?

551
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:20,593
Yeah. I get it.

552
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:22,909
The guy I'm replacing...
he sat here.

553
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:27,069
You can have mine. That's...

554
00:38:28,366 --> 00:38:30,856
I'm not gonna need it anymore,
and, you know, actually,

555
00:38:30,857 --> 00:38:32,757
I suppose you're replacing me as well.

556
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,560
These are really good people here.

557
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:39,608
Yeah.

558
00:38:40,608 --> 00:38:41,608
Hey.

559
00:38:51,047 --> 00:38:52,297
I'll see you soon enough.

560
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:56,248
That's all I know.

561
00:38:58,049 --> 00:38:59,607
We'd better notify Jack.

562
00:38:59,608 --> 00:39:00,608
Yeah.

563
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,670
Yeah. Go, go.

564
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:27,367
- Hello?
- Hey.

565
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:28,869
Got your message.

566
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,630
Have you identified the body?

567
00:39:30,742 --> 00:39:32,942
That's why I'm calling.
The body was stolen.

568
00:39:33,868 --> 00:39:36,054
It was being held
by a Scientific Research division.

569
00:39:36,055 --> 00:39:37,205
Their facility was hit.

570
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:40,292
Once I get the incident report,
I'll forward you the details.

571
00:39:40,307 --> 00:39:41,466
I'll dig around.

572
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,200
See what I can find out.
