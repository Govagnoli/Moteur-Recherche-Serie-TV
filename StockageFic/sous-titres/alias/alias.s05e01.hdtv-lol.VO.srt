1
00:00:07,153 --> 00:00:08,153
Okay.

2
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:10,051
Whatever it is, I can handle.

3
00:00:10,838 --> 00:00:12,382
Just don't tell me you are a bad guy.

4
00:00:17,215 --> 00:00:18,465
You're not a bad guy, are you?

5
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:23,273
What?

6
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:25,232
It's no accident
that I was the one you came to

7
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:28,146
when you walked into the C.I.A.
with your story about SD-6.

8
00:00:28,147 --> 00:00:30,313
Vaughn, I don't understand.
What are you telling me?

9
00:00:31,146 --> 00:00:33,187
Well, for starters,
my name isn't Michael Vaughn.

10
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:19,006
Vaughn?

11
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,870
Vaughn?

12
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,750
Don't worry.
We're gonna get you outta here.

13
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,790
Is he okay?

14
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:34,184
You just stay still, all right?

15
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,113
I don't need anything. I'm fine.

16
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:41,258
I don't need any of that.

17
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:44,717
The girl's alive.
We'll take care of her.

18
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:45,718
Copy four minutes out.

19
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:56,444
There she is!

20
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,333
We're gonna run a few tests
just as a precaution,

21
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:00,584
but everything appears normal.

22
00:04:01,643 --> 00:04:02,643
When can I go home?

23
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:03,894
Soon.

24
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:05,854
But you're gonna have to take it easy.

25
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:07,206
Of course.

26
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:20,227
Miss Bristow?

27
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,053
How you feeling?

28
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,666
Oh, Gordon Dean,
Office of Special Investigations.

29
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,330
Any word on Vaughn?

30
00:04:29,582 --> 00:04:30,582
No, I'm afraid not.

31
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:34,765
I hate to do this now, agent Bristow,
given what you've been through.

32
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:35,974
I already called in a report.

33
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:38,413
Yes, I know. I just need for you
to clarify a few things,

34
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:39,662
if that's all right with you.

35
00:04:41,637 --> 00:04:44,178
In your report, you indicated
you two were going on vacation.

36
00:04:45,387 --> 00:04:47,053
- You didn't say where.
- Santa Barbara.

37
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:49,741
And you were struck about halfway there?

38
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,323
About that, yeah.

39
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:52,926
What about before the accident?

40
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:55,198
Did agent Vaughn seem anxious,
perhaps preoccupied?

41
00:04:57,134 --> 00:04:59,175
He seemed relaxed.
We were taking a few days off.

42
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:03,632
You're not writing any of this down.

43
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,736
You are not telling me
anything worth writing.

44
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:08,944
I'm telling you exactly what I remember.
I mean, if that's not enough--

45
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:09,945
You two are engaged.

46
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:11,358
- Isn't that correct?
- Yes.

47
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:13,126
And you understand
that marital privilege

48
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:14,960
does not trump
matters of national security.

49
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,379
Of course I do.

50
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,755
Then I am asking you
to remember where your loyalty lies.

51
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:20,733
My loyalty? My fiancé was just abducted.

52
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:23,337
Perhaps.
That's what we're trying to determine.

53
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:25,191
Wait a minute. What are you suggesting?

54
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:28,064
Whatever information you need,

55
00:05:28,313 --> 00:05:29,938
my daughter will be happy to cooperate,

56
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:32,187
but she's just been through
a traumatic experience.

57
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,893
I'm sure you can afford her some time.

58
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:35,413
Of course, Director Bristow.

59
00:05:35,996 --> 00:05:37,004
We'll talk again.

60
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:38,796
Soon.

61
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:39,996
Thank you.

62
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,450
Dad.

63
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:47,366
Sydney, when your mother defected,
I spent a year

64
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:49,928
in prison because the C.I.A.
assumed I collaborated with her.

65
00:05:51,138 --> 00:05:53,096
Before you say anything
that may implicate you,

66
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:54,385
we need to go over your story.

67
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:55,844
My story? Dad, what is going on?

68
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:58,987
Vaughn is currently under investigation.

69
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,759
There have been a number of red flags
raised by his conduct.

70
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,571
What red flags?

71
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:05,611
Langley believes
Vaughn may be a double agent.

72
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,861
They think the crash
may have been an extraction.

73
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,273
I've been hearing about you
for a long time.

74
00:06:27,064 --> 00:06:28,855
It's nice to finally meet you,
Mr Michaux.

76
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,666
You've had a bad day.

77
00:07:38,731 --> 00:07:39,731
Where's Sydney?

78
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:41,580
She's in better shape than you.

79
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:44,039
Your shoulder's dislocated.

80
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:47,726
We'll take care of that.

81
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,540
I, uh...

82
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:54,035
I believe this was intended for you.

83
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:02,950
Oh, come on.
Don't tell me you're not curious.

84
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,780
Open it.

85
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:23,967
Catchy, but dated.

86
00:08:36,712 --> 00:08:38,170
You mind telling me what this says?

87
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:47,561
- 5, 7, 3, 8, 4.
- We know what this is about.

88
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:49,644
We know who sent it.

89
00:08:50,272 --> 00:08:51,813
What we don't know is where's Lehman.

90
00:08:53,142 --> 00:08:54,142
Who?

91
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:57,224
You must be in a lot of pain.

92
00:08:58,206 --> 00:08:59,997
Maybe that's why
your memory's a bit fuzzy.

93
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:03,305
Why don't we help Mr Michaux out?

94
00:09:12,638 --> 00:09:15,554
It flew somewhere. Those helicopters
are stealth. They're not invisi...

95
00:09:16,576 --> 00:09:17,701
Then retask the satellites.

96
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:20,573
All right, call me back with something.

97
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:21,633
- Syd.
- Any word yet?

98
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:24,699
No.

99
00:09:25,257 --> 00:09:26,798
But there is a guy here from Langley,

100
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:29,072
-  and he's been insinuating...
- I know.

101
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:32,964
Why was Vaughn
assigned to be my handler?

102
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:34,692
What do you mean?

103
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:36,901
Six years ago,
when I walked into that C.I.A. office,

104
00:09:38,193 --> 00:09:39,651
why was Vaughn assigned to my case?

105
00:09:41,564 --> 00:09:42,772
I don't know. He asked to be.

106
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:45,605
You came in. You were all screwed up.

107
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:47,753
You had that freaky red hair.
He likes a challenge.

108
00:09:49,877 --> 00:09:52,168
Hold it. You're not actually
considering this, are you?

109
00:09:53,936 --> 00:09:55,936
Syd, the idea that he's disloyal,
that's insane.

110
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,375
Y eah.

111
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,103
Just tell us what we want to know.

112
00:10:02,746 --> 00:10:04,121
I'm tired of playing these games.

113
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:06,433
Quitter.

114
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,559
Are you really gonna hold out
until we kill you?

115
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:14,619
I can respect that.

116
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:18,971
It seems Mr Michaux
needs a little incentive.

117
00:10:22,181 --> 00:10:23,639
Go down the hallway to his fiancée.

118
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:26,655
- Bring her in?
- Just her finger.

119
00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:30,738
- Leave her out of this.
- That's up to you, isn't it?

120
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:33,112
The one with the ring.

121
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,570
Kind of poetic, don't you think?

122
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:39,987
Stop!

123
00:10:44,484 --> 00:10:45,562
The message,

124
00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:47,213
it's in code.

125
00:10:49,114 --> 00:10:50,175
I need a pencil.

126
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:55,559
Can you speed it up, agent Blinkman?

127
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:56,912
Flinkman. With an "f" sound.

128
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:00,746
Not that hard, really.

129
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:04,881
Look, I know you wanted me
to access agent Vaughn's personal files,

130
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,365
but I'll tell you right now,
you're not gonna find anything.

131
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,657
No one is judging agent Vaughn.

132
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:10,867
If he was up to something,
I'd know about it.

133
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:12,115
I mean, we're friends.

134
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:13,617
We do lunch.

135
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:15,989
How much longer?

136
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,300
- Hey.
- Hey.

137
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:39,543
How are you holding up?

138
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:45,171
What if I was wrong about him?

139
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,605
Sydney, you remember
when we were working for SD-6,

140
00:11:55,287 --> 00:11:56,287
that night on the pier?

141
00:11:57,288 --> 00:11:59,163
I caught you breaking
into a secure facility.

142
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:02,017
You asked me to trust you, but I didn't.

143
00:12:02,102 --> 00:12:04,393
The proof was right in front of me.
You were a traitor.

144
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,740
If I had to do it over again,

145
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,920
I'd give you the benefit of the doubt.

146
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,090
Is there a problem?

147
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:25,675
I can't write. Would you mind
setting my shoulder?

148
00:12:44,987 --> 00:12:45,987
Where's Sydney?

149
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,050
Where is she? Answer me!

150
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:49,695
She escaped. She got away!

151
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:16,644
- Hello?
- Sydney, you okay?

152
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:18,413
Thank God.

153
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:21,101
I'm fine.

154
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:23,479
Hang on.

155
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:31,972
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

156
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:33,155
Where are you?

157
00:13:33,193 --> 00:13:35,737
- Look, I know you have questions.
- About a million of 'em.

158
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:38,083
I'll tell you everything
as soon as I can, but, Sydney,

159
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:39,623
no one can know you're talking to me.

160
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:41,745
I need my father's watch.
You need to get it to me.

161
00:13:41,773 --> 00:13:44,637
Do you remember the dead drop
we used to contact Tessina, the lockers?

162
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:45,659
Of course I do...

163
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:50,532
I don't know.

164
00:13:50,592 --> 00:13:52,342
Syd, please,
I need you to do this for me.

165
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:57,006
I need to think about it.

166
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,462
Where is he?

167
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:02,150
I don't know what you're talking about.

168
00:14:02,151 --> 00:14:04,692
By withholding information,
you're only implicating yourself.

169
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,650
I'll give you one more chance.

170
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:13,859
Sydney, I understand your inclination
is to protect Vaughn at any cost,

171
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:16,086
but assume you're right,

172
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:18,899
that this wasn't an extraction,
that Vaughn was abducted.

173
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:22,730
Then even if he's escaped, he's still
in a tremendous amount of danger.

174
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,270
If you really wanna protect him,
let us bring him in safely.

175
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:36,702
He's in Mexico City.

176
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:06,806
- Perimeter's set.
- Good. Let's do it.

177
00:15:14,052 --> 00:15:15,052
Go, go, clear!

178
00:15:19,364 --> 00:15:20,364
You're looking for this?

179
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:40,169
I want the truth.

180
00:15:41,668 --> 00:15:42,668
Start with your name.

181
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:44,356
André Michaux.

182
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:47,018
I'll tell you the rest on the way.

183
00:16:12,535 --> 00:16:13,868
7 years ago, a woman came to me,

184
00:16:14,176 --> 00:16:16,326
said that her father
had been involved in a project,

185
00:16:16,364 --> 00:16:18,844
something that people had gone
to great lengths to cover up.

186
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,261
She said my father was part of it,

187
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:22,674
said it was called Prophet Five.

188
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:25,302
- You father was an agent.
- Before he joined the C.I.A.

189
00:16:26,531 --> 00:16:28,947
She said his name was Michaux,
that he was a mathematician.

190
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,151
The day you walked into the C.I.A.,

191
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:41,985
you described a mission-to-secure device
made by a man named Muller,

192
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:44,711
the same man I was told
originated the Prophet Five project.

193
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,191
Now this was my first proof
that this woman's story was true.

194
00:16:48,396 --> 00:16:50,562
But whatever it was
my father was running away from,

195
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:52,792
he changed his identity,
he changed mine.

196
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:54,462
I was 18 months old at the time.

197
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:56,878
And this man we're meeting,
James Lehman--

198
00:16:57,207 --> 00:16:59,311
Renée and I have been trying
to find him for years.

199
00:16:59,312 --> 00:17:00,895
We believe he worked with our fathers.

200
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,396
Renée  who? Who is this woman?

201
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:04,623
Renée Rienne.

202
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:06,186
Vaughn!

203
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:38,011
The watch-- show it to me.

204
00:17:44,988 --> 00:17:46,321
You were supposed to come alone.

205
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:48,404
Whatever you say to me, she can hear.

206
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:52,672
Follow me.

207
00:17:58,235 --> 00:18:00,568
I was prepared to bring
agent Vaughn in for questioning.

208
00:18:02,518 --> 00:18:03,732
You think I know where he is?

209
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,858
Oh, I think it's possible, yes.
Your daughter, too.

210
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:09,792
I don't.

211
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:10,919
Then I have no choice.

212
00:18:11,293 --> 00:18:13,209
I am now officially
classifying him a fugitive

213
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:15,438
and your daughter an accomplice.

214
00:18:16,104 --> 00:18:17,937
Now if you want me to show her
any leniency,

215
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:19,895
find her and tell me where she is.

216
00:18:23,414 --> 00:18:24,789
Maybe you should try Mexico City.

217
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:28,768
You'll be notified
when they've been apprehended.

218
00:18:31,287 --> 00:18:32,953
- Hey, Mr Dean.
- What is it, Marshall?

219
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:38,074
He's not gonna find Sydney
and Vaughn, not from what I gave him.

220
00:18:38,282 --> 00:18:39,865
I encrypted Vaughn's files, 4,096-bit.

221
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:41,532
It'll take 'em years.

222
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:43,698
I mean, he's an ass. Deal with it.

223
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:46,239
Do you still have the originals?

224
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:47,906
Get them for me.

225
00:18:52,154 --> 00:18:53,445
Before I start, you should know

226
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,258
your father did everything he could
to protect you from this.

227
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:00,883
Mr. Lehman,
I want to know about Prophet Five.

228
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:04,899
I was a cryptologist,

229
00:19:05,648 --> 00:19:07,731
a specialist in patterns
working for the Pentagon.

230
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:12,254
In 1972, a private foundation
recruited me along with others,

231
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:15,982
scientists, linguists,
the best and the brightest.

232
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,249
That's where I met your father.

233
00:19:20,396 --> 00:19:21,396
What was the objective?

234
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:23,968
We were given one page of a book,

235
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:26,845
the "Profeta Cinque,"
"the Fifth Prophet."

236
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:32,258
A 15th-century text that supposedly
had been written in an unbreakable code.

237
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,547
And they wanted you to break the code.

238
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:37,776
- Were you successful?
- After years, yes.

239
00:19:39,524 --> 00:19:41,607
It referred to proteins,
amino acids, nucleotides.

240
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,630
It seemed to be some sort of
advanced genetics

241
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:45,815
500 years ahead of its time.

242
00:19:46,962 --> 00:19:48,878
Just a few days after
we turned in our report,

243
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:50,565
your father contacted me.

244
00:19:52,712 --> 00:19:54,587
He told me what was happening
to the others--

245
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:57,586
accidents, car crashes,
fires, heart attacks, strokes,

246
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:00,625
all people involved with the project.

247
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,292
So I followed your father's advice.

248
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,083
I changed my name.

249
00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:08,391
I disappeared.

250
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:11,498
What's changed now?
Why did you contact us?

251
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:14,454
Over the years, I've developed sources,

252
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:16,420
leads as to where

253
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:20,119
the book might be stored,

254
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:22,584
but all my attempts
at recovery have failed.

255
00:20:23,564 --> 00:20:24,564
You have another lead.

256
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:30,604
These people, whoever they are,

257
00:20:32,562 --> 00:20:33,853
when they know you're on to it,

258
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:36,246
they'll stop at nothing to silence you.

259
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,390
I'll contact you when I have the book.

260
00:20:54,325 --> 00:20:55,325
Thank you, Sir.

261
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,450
Your invitation, please.

262
00:21:12,994 --> 00:21:14,494
My husband is right. It is my fault.

263
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:17,231
Go ahead.

264
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,886
I was sitting over there.
I misplaced my sunglasses.

265
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,527
We're waltzing.

266
00:22:02,214 --> 00:22:04,005
Yeah, I've been practicing
for our wedding.

267
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:05,946
With whom?

268
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:07,501
Weiss.

269
00:22:57,631 --> 00:22:59,881
- Hey, I found the junction box.
- Ready when you are.

270
00:23:01,184 --> 00:23:02,184
It's been customized.

271
00:23:02,932 --> 00:23:04,348
Hang on. I'll call you right back.

272
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,865
- Hello?
- Do you remember what you said,

273
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:10,158
if you had to do it over again?

274
00:23:10,874 --> 00:23:12,049
What do you need ?

275
00:23:12,113 --> 00:23:16,346
Service records, pan Global Security,
serial number 16154131.

276
00:23:31,435 --> 00:23:32,643
Just admiring the collection.

277
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,075
It's pretty gruesome if you ask me.

278
00:23:41,057 --> 00:23:42,122
My dad's really into guns.

279
00:23:43,323 --> 00:23:44,632
I think he's overcompensating.

280
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:49,479
You're Walter, aren't you?

281
00:23:50,823 --> 00:23:51,823
What gave me away?

282
00:23:53,072 --> 00:23:55,072
Dad's always going on
about the new guy at work.

283
00:23:59,381 --> 00:24:00,464
Aren't you a little young?

284
00:24:01,757 --> 00:24:03,840
I'm a little young
to be stuck at this snore-fest.

285
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:08,382
Looks like the safe's been rerouted
through the central alarm system.

286
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:09,566
You'll need to repatch.

287
00:24:10,127 --> 00:24:11,168
Do you see a purple wire?

288
00:24:11,252 --> 00:24:12,252
- Yes, I do.
- Cut it.

289
00:24:13,191 --> 00:24:14,191
Got it.

290
00:24:14,254 --> 00:24:15,670
Okay, tie it to the last terminal.

291
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:17,354
My dad's threatened by you, you know?

292
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:18,876
I very much doubt that.

293
00:24:19,363 --> 00:24:20,416
Seriously...

294
00:24:20,517 --> 00:24:21,863
he's so lame.

295
00:24:23,173 --> 00:24:24,180
But you're young,

296
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:25,443
smart,

297
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:26,523
cute.

298
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,843
You know, this party would be
a lot more fun if we were naked.

299
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:32,434
That's not going to happen.

300
00:24:33,184 --> 00:24:34,184
-  Done.
- That's it.

301
00:24:34,435 --> 00:24:36,226
You just need to reset the system
and wait.

302
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:40,516
You know, there are better ways
to get back at your father.

303
00:24:41,057 --> 00:24:42,099
None that involve me...

304
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,065
and you.

305
00:24:47,155 --> 00:24:48,155
Whoa, okay.

306
00:24:49,091 --> 00:24:50,091
You need to leave now,

307
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:52,820
or your dad's gonna find out
what his little girl's really like.

308
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,530
Jerk.

309
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,612
Oh, Dixon,

310
00:25:06,613 --> 00:25:08,487
- Thank you!
- Be safe.

311
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:18,833
Oh, Walter?

312
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:22,521
Guess you're getting fired.

313
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:33,205
I'm heading to the extraction point.

314
00:25:33,394 --> 00:25:34,394
Sydney?

315
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:36,932
This is Dr. Park.
Your test results are in.

316
00:25:37,952 --> 00:25:39,243
Now isn't really the best time.

317
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,390
- Let me get--
- You're gonna want to hear this.

318
00:25:49,263 --> 00:25:50,263
We have to go.

319
00:25:52,698 --> 00:25:53,698
The doctor called.

320
00:25:55,446 --> 00:25:56,446
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

321
00:25:57,546 --> 00:25:59,146
You two ! Stop right there!

322
00:26:18,668 --> 00:26:19,668
Arvin.

323
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,999
- Nadia-- how is she?
- There's been no change.

324
00:26:25,575 --> 00:26:26,914
I have to get out of here, Jack.

325
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:29,529
If you're not prepared
to charge me with a crime,

326
00:26:29,557 --> 00:26:30,598
you have to do something.

327
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:32,140
I am trying to expedite your release.

328
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,599
It's not enough.

329
00:26:35,096 --> 00:26:37,137
My daughter is being kept in a coma,
a coma Jack.

330
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:40,537
She's suffering from a condition
that no one understands.

331
00:26:40,597 --> 00:26:43,430
It is a condition that I am
responsible for with no hope for a cure.

332
00:26:47,934 --> 00:26:49,218
I can't help my daughter

333
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:50,884
sitting in a cell

334
00:26:50,907 --> 00:26:52,573
coming through obscure medical journals.

335
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:54,967
I know.

336
00:27:00,341 --> 00:27:01,341
I'm sorry, Jack. I...

337
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:05,528
You didn't come here for that.
What is it?

338
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:09,611
Are you aware of the off-book trips
Vaughn took to Marseilles,

339
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:11,047
3 over the last 12 months?

340
00:27:12,152 --> 00:27:13,943
They occurred
while you were head of A.P.O.

341
00:27:14,773 --> 00:27:16,856
If you're looking
to find out if I tasked him. No.

342
00:27:18,896 --> 00:27:20,021
Tell me what this is about.

343
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:28,798
Serbia, two years ago.

344
00:27:30,175 --> 00:27:31,175
Istanbul, 2001.

345
00:27:36,546 --> 00:27:37,921
Are you familiar with Le Corbeau?

346
00:27:38,795 --> 00:27:40,695
The Raven, Renée Rienne.

347
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,860
That's right.

348
00:27:42,168 --> 00:27:45,293
She's wanted for the assassination
of the Turkish Interior Minister in 2001

349
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:48,668
and for the murders
of 3 C.I.A. agents stationed in Serbia.

350
00:27:50,995 --> 00:27:52,453
Vaughn's movements track with hers.

351
00:27:57,369 --> 00:27:58,535
Does Sydney know about this?

352
00:28:00,991 --> 00:28:01,991
Tell her, Jack.

353
00:28:13,852 --> 00:28:14,977
Tell me you have something.

354
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:16,977
4,096-bit. Not bad.

355
00:28:18,668 --> 00:28:20,162
But whoever screwed with these files

356
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:22,777
he used a modified version
of D.O.D.'S encryption algorithm.

357
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,328
I hacked in Tenesse's network
and pull the decryption key.

358
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:26,914
What did you find?

359
00:28:27,035 --> 00:28:29,160
Your fugitive used a handful
of documented aliases,

360
00:28:29,662 --> 00:28:31,953
one of which passed through
Italian customs last night.

361
00:28:32,973 --> 00:28:33,973
You're a genius.

362
00:28:35,497 --> 00:28:36,497
Yeah, I know.

363
00:28:43,741 --> 00:28:44,741
He said 9. We're early.

364
00:28:52,302 --> 00:28:53,593
Are we both gonna just sit here

365
00:28:53,802 --> 00:28:55,885
and not talk about the thing
we're thinking about?

366
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,823
Where are you with this, Vaughn?

367
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,674
I just need to know how you feel.

368
00:29:03,362 --> 00:29:04,403
Is it something you want?

369
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:07,962
The truth?

370
00:29:08,591 --> 00:29:09,591
Of course.

371
00:29:13,525 --> 00:29:15,775
What we do, the things
we see every day, honestly, no,

372
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:19,716
I didn't think this is what I wanted...

373
00:29:19,774 --> 00:29:22,315
I mean, bringing a baby
into this world that is so messed up,

374
00:29:23,149 --> 00:29:25,024
I just assumed that I'd wait,
that we'd wait.

375
00:29:27,588 --> 00:29:28,588
For?

376
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:31,002
For things to be safe or at least safer.

377
00:29:32,524 --> 00:29:33,536
Yeah.

378
00:29:34,737 --> 00:29:35,824
I get it.

379
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,784
But looking at you,

380
00:29:43,185 --> 00:29:45,043
all I can think about is

381
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,499
what our kid is gonna be like and I'm

382
00:29:48,957 --> 00:29:50,123
not worried about the world.

383
00:29:50,386 --> 00:29:51,455
I just..

384
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,289
I can't wait
to meet this new little person.

385
00:29:57,205 --> 00:29:58,205
- Really?
- Yeah.

386
00:30:00,453 --> 00:30:01,828
I mean, it's pretty great, right?

387
00:30:04,953 --> 00:30:06,578
Yeah and you're gonna be
an amazing mom

388
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,014
and I'm gonna be a disaster.
I've never changed a diaper.

389
00:30:10,073 --> 00:30:12,739
Neither have I. We're gonna have
to call Marshall for an assist.

390
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,760
He's here.

391
00:30:22,945 --> 00:30:23,945
You should go.

392
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,113
Okay.

393
00:30:26,298 --> 00:30:27,298
I'll be right back.

394
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:30,049
Start thinking of names.

395
00:31:03,536 --> 00:31:04,536
Can you decode it?

396
00:31:04,912 --> 00:31:05,912
It'll take awhile.

397
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,993
When I'm done, I'll contact you.

398
00:31:08,846 --> 00:31:10,721
From now on, do not initiate
contact with me.

399
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:40,033
Vaughn.

400
00:32:43,108 --> 00:32:44,108
God.

401
00:33:18,978 --> 00:33:20,039
He's still in surgery.

402
00:33:20,076 --> 00:33:21,985
No one's come out.
No one's told me anything.

403
00:33:21,986 --> 00:33:23,611
I hope you understand what you've done.

404
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:24,733
What?

405
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:26,986
Your heroic efforts
to help Vaughn were shortsighted.

406
00:33:26,987 --> 00:33:29,278
You acted impetuously
without the benefit of the facts.

407
00:33:29,302 --> 00:33:30,805
You don't know
what you're talking--

408
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,636
Sydney,
Vaughn is not the person you think.

409
00:33:34,234 --> 00:33:35,900
He's been working with a known criminal.

410
00:33:35,921 --> 00:33:36,921
Renée Rienne. I know.

411
00:33:37,857 --> 00:33:40,107
Then what on earth
prompted you to risk your own life,

412
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,961
not to mention
your professional integrity?

413
00:33:42,233 --> 00:33:43,233
Dad, Vaughn and I,

414
00:33:47,105 --> 00:33:48,105
we're having a baby.

415
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:53,000
There's an explanation for all of this
if you'll let me tell you.

416
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,290
Is he out of surgery?

417
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:58,643
He's in recovery now, but

418
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,579
the organ damage he sustained
was significant.

419
00:34:03,163 --> 00:34:05,413
Our expectation is
that we will stop the bleeding, but

420
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,641
we'll know more in the next 24 hours.

421
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:11,158
I need to see him.

422
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,200
Well, you can wait in his room
until he wakes up.

423
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Sydney.

424
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:21,044
I will do everything I can

425
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:23,458
to help you both.

426
00:34:33,395 --> 00:34:34,454
Yes?

427
00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:35,808
I just spoke with Director Chase.

428
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:37,559
Gordon Dean
wasn't Special Investigations.

429
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:39,202
He went off the grid two years ago.

430
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:40,787
- Status?
- He's presumed dead.

431
00:34:57,741 --> 00:34:58,741
Hi.

432
00:35:02,364 --> 00:35:04,655
Gordon Dean is a ghost,
well-placed and well-connected.

433
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:11,611
What are we gonna do?

434
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:15,151
Hey, I just broke about 30 federal laws.

435
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,918
If I get caught, I'll be sharing a cell
with a guy named Bruno.

436
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,752
It's white collar.
More like Martha Stewart.

437
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:21,959
I contacted our Italian friend.

438
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,730
He's got the passports.

439
00:35:24,107 --> 00:35:26,565
He'll coordinate the transport
as soon as Vaughn is stable.

440
00:35:27,072 --> 00:35:28,104
What's the outlook?

441
00:35:28,105 --> 00:35:29,980
Sometime in the next 24 to 48 hours,
we hope.

442
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:31,045
Weiss, are you there?

443
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:32,263
Yeah, I've got the blueprints

444
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:34,134
of the Cape Town villa
right in front of me.

445
00:35:34,163 --> 00:35:36,998
We're gonna have no problem getting in,
but we will need two teams.

446
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:38,425
You have my full authorization.

447
00:35:38,482 --> 00:35:39,843
What about the Pentagon records?

448
00:35:39,899 --> 00:35:41,221
Well, I already cross-referenced

449
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,205
the 1972 archives
for the name "Prophet Five."

450
00:35:43,252 --> 00:35:44,313
So far, no luck.

451
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,058
Keep looking.
Go back at least ten years.

452
00:35:46,475 --> 00:35:47,600
Someone might have slipped.

453
00:35:52,222 --> 00:35:53,263
I've always liked "Owen."

454
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:58,722
Owen.

455
00:35:59,345 --> 00:36:01,220
That sounds like
something you name a gerbil.

456
00:36:04,407 --> 00:36:05,407
"Clementine" is cute.

457
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:08,531
For a fruit.

458
00:36:09,718 --> 00:36:10,718
It's also a name.

459
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,863
It's also a campfire song.

460
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,341
Okay, you don't like that one.

461
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,650
What about "Isabelle"?

462
00:36:26,276 --> 00:36:27,276
Isabelle Vaughn.

463
00:36:29,462 --> 00:36:30,462
Isabelle Bristow Vaughn.

464
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:35,042
That's pretty.

465
00:36:36,443 --> 00:36:37,505
I like that.

466
00:36:39,853 --> 00:36:40,853
Me too.

467
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,078
I'm sorry. I'm just getting so tired.

468
00:36:52,537 --> 00:36:54,037
Close your eyes. I'll be right here.

469
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:03,722
Syd?

470
00:37:07,406 --> 00:37:08,406
I love you.

471
00:37:10,092 --> 00:37:11,092
I love you, too.

472
00:41:21,955 --> 00:41:22,955
Can I help you?

473
00:41:23,453 --> 00:41:24,661
You're a hard person to find,

474
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:27,722
but if I can do it, so can they.

475
00:41:31,453 --> 00:41:33,161
Sorry,
no idea what you're talking about.

476
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,158
I know who you are, Renée.

477
00:41:41,387 --> 00:41:42,387
We need to talk.

478
00:41:44,948 --> 00:41:46,198
We have nothing to talk about.

479
00:41:49,386 --> 00:41:50,469
It's about Michael Vaughn.

480
00:42:02,379 --> 00:42:03,379
You're Sydney.

481
00:42:03,692 --> 00:42:04,692
Yeah.

482
00:42:06,505 --> 00:42:07,505
How did you find me?

483
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:08,818
I know everything.

484
00:42:11,314 --> 00:42:12,689
Then you should have walked away.

485
00:42:14,689 --> 00:42:15,855
You don't know me very well.
