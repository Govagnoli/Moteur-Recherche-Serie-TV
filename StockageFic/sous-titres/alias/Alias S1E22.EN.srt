1
00:00:03,187 --> 00:00:05,606
My name is Sydney Bristow.

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:10,778
Seven years ago, I was recruited by a
secret branch of the CIA called SD-6.

3
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:14,490
I was sworn to secrecy, but I
couldn't keep it from my fiancé.

4
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:17,993
And when the head of SD-6
found out, he had him killed.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,082
That's when I learned the truth.
SD-6 is not part of the CIA.

6
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:26,377
I'd been working for the people
I thought I was fighting.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,630
I went to the only place
that could help me take them down.

8
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:34,969
Now I'm a double agent for the CIA.
My handler is Michael Vaughn.

9
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:38,597
Only one other person
knows what I do,

10
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:41,434
another double agent inside SD-6.

11
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:43,978
Someone I hardly know.

12
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:46,730
My father.

13
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:51,902
- It's Emily. She knows about SD-6.
- I know. It's too late.

14
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:56,323
- Your conversation was recorded.
- Sloane won't let them kill Emily.

15
00:00:56,407 --> 00:01:00,786
A decision will be made when Sloane
meets the head of Alliance security.

16
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:09,753
- Don't bring him into this life.
- He is in this life, like it or not.

17
00:01:12,298 --> 00:01:15,176
You'll be safe here. I promise.

18
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:20,055
And if you need anything, there are
agents watching behind the mirror.

19
00:01:22,057 --> 00:01:27,021
Guys, is there a food situation?
Can I get something to eat?

20
00:01:27,104 --> 00:01:29,774
Like a burger or something? I'm easy.

21
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:33,736
30 minutes or less.

22
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:33,838
My employer's instructed me
to keep you alive.

23
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:36,090
But not comfortable.

24
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:39,343
So I'll ask you once.

25
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:44,056
What is the Circumference
and how do you know about it?

26
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,894
Listen to me, man, there has been
a major misunderstanding here.

27
00:02:48,978 --> 00:02:52,398
I don't know
what the Circumference is.

28
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:54,984
Do you understand me?

29
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:57,653
I don't know.

30
00:03:56,712 --> 00:03:59,006
Hello.

31
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:07,848
I'm opening a restaurant.
I have to open a restaurant.

32
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:11,352
- What are you talking about?
- I'm waiting for life to start.

33
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:15,397
- My ass is on that couch all day.
- You're about to graduate.

34
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:18,818
But then what? I didn't have a plan.
Here's a plan.

35
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:21,112
Do you already have a place?

36
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:24,782
It's in Silverlake. I'm not even sure
what it's gonna be yet.

37
00:04:32,414 --> 00:04:33,707
Hello.

38
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,876
Sydney Bristow?

39
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,214
Yes.

40
00:04:40,297 --> 00:04:43,425
I'm calling on this line
because it's untraceable.

41
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:48,639
Listen carefully. We have your friend
and we plan to kill him.

42
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:52,268
Unless you do the following.

43
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:56,897
A document was stolen from a Paris
nightclub. It belongs to my employer.

44
00:04:56,981 --> 00:05:00,443
Though it appears to be a blank
page, it has a great value to him.

45
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:05,489
He wants it back, along with
a certain container of liquid.

46
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:10,161
I believe you are familiar with
the items to which I am referring.

47
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:12,621
- Yes, I am.
- Don't listen to him!

48
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:15,374
Don't do anything for me!

49
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:19,462
You have 48 hours. There's an alley
in Taipei, at Ho Ping and Rui An.

50
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:22,673
Be there Tuesday at midnight.

51
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:27,094
The CIA has the page Khasinau
wants. SD-6 has the ampoule.

52
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:29,889
You and I could get them both
and turn them over.

53
00:05:29,972 --> 00:05:33,809
We cannot afford to hand the enemy
something he wants so desperately.

54
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:36,479
I don't know that much about you.

55
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,485
Do you have any close friends?
I mean, people that you love?

56
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:46,697
I don't need a lecture on friendship
to understand what's at stake.

57
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:51,118
While I might look at scenarios
more strategically than emotionally,

58
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:54,121
you could learn something
from my experience.

59
00:05:54,205 --> 00:06:00,419
Khasinau can't make the ink on that
page visible without the ampoule.

60
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:03,339
Reading that page
is so important to Khasinau

61
00:06:03,422 --> 00:06:07,176
that he risked sending a team
into SD-6 to try and steal it.

62
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:12,598
You wanna get the page and the
ampoule and see what that page is.

63
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:16,268
We can't strategise our next move
without that information.

64
00:06:17,103 --> 00:06:20,397
Getting the ampoule
should be straightforward.

65
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,234
It's recovering the page
I'm concerned about.

66
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:28,572
It was moved to the SD-6 offsite lab,
which is on a former military site.

67
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:32,535
It's surrounded by water. You get in
through the drainage system.

68
00:06:32,618 --> 00:06:36,372
Access requires Sloane's voice,
ID and fingerprints.

69
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:41,168
It's Vaughn.

70
00:06:41,252 --> 00:06:44,964
Khasinau knew about the safehouse.
He has someone on the inside.

71
00:06:45,047 --> 00:06:48,843
As long as there's a mole at the CIA,
you can't tell Vaughn a thing,

72
00:06:48,926 --> 00:06:51,971
not that you've been contacted
or that we have spoken.

73
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:54,765
Sydney, I'm so sorry about this,

74
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,352
but there's no reason
to assume the worst.

75
00:06:58,436 --> 00:07:02,731
They tranquillised the security team,
so they weren't out for blood.

76
00:07:02,815 --> 00:07:08,195
If this is a kidnapping,
they'll contact us.

77
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:12,658
I'm just so scared for him.

78
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:19,415
You'll contact me
if you hear anything?

79
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:25,546
Vaughn?

80
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:29,175
What's going on?

81
00:07:31,135 --> 00:07:33,220
What do you mean?

82
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:36,766
I haven't known Sydney that long,

83
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:41,061
but I know she doesn't just accept
problems, she tries to fix them.

84
00:07:41,145 --> 00:07:43,355
You think she'll use back channels?

85
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,608
- Maybe.
- Why wouldn't she tell you?

86
00:07:45,691 --> 00:07:49,695
The safehouse was compromised.
She doesn't trust the CIA right now.

87
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:53,866
Trust is a tricky thing.

88
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:57,953
What does that mean?

89
00:07:58,037 --> 00:08:00,206
You need to fill Devlin in
about Sydney.

90
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:03,125
Not a chance.
Fill him in on conjecture?

91
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:05,294
This is a difficult time for you.

92
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:08,589
Do not let your concern
get ahead of your responsibilities.

93
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:12,802
- That is not what I'm doing!
- My investigation's on a schedule.

94
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:15,930
- You're late.
- I didn't think you'd mind.

95
00:08:16,013 --> 00:08:18,516
Guess what? I do.

96
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:32,196
Arvin, this is beautiful.

97
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,449
Did you invent this place
for me to recover in?

98
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:37,618
Sit down.

99
00:08:39,662 --> 00:08:42,915
You've been quiet
since we left the hospital.

100
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,585
Arvin, you're scaring me.

101
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:03,269
SD-6 is not part of the CIA.

102
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:19,845
This shirt is made
of heat-sensitive material.

103
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:22,014
Get Sloane to touch it.

104
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:26,644
It'll transmit a digital copy of
his prints. I'll create a latex copy.

105
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:30,606
This is a wireless relay.
It'll log me into Sloane's computer.

106
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:33,359
I'll acquire the passwords,
then you talk.

107
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:35,820
He doesn't need to say
the actual words.

108
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,240
Every word in English
is comprised of 44 basic phonemes.

109
00:10:39,323 --> 00:10:43,786
He's likely to say most of them.
I'll shape them into the right words.

110
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:47,373
You'll have less than an hour
to get to the facility

111
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:51,085
before the passwords change.

112
00:10:51,168 --> 00:10:53,754
Dad... thanks.

113
00:10:55,714 --> 00:10:59,301
Marshall, can you remember back
to the Aconcagua operation?

114
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:03,639
- Sydney's code name?
- Miss Bristow? It was Bluebird.

115
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:09,186
Bluebird. So it wasn't Freelancer?

116
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,023
Freelancer?
No, it was Bluebird, definitely.

117
00:11:25,911 --> 00:11:28,747
Excuse me. Do you have a minute?

118
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,959
Yeah, of course.

119
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:36,046
I feel so selfish
coming to you like this.

120
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,468
Especially knowing what you
and Emily must be going through.

121
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:44,930
- Sydney...
- Keep him away from his computer.

122
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,895
What is it, Sydney? You can tell me.

123
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:54,648
Come on. You can tell me.

124
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:02,740
Got his prints.
Still accessing central security.

125
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:06,619
I don't remember much
about my mother.

126
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:09,121
When I think of the things
that I missed,

127
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:12,750
the experiences I wish
I'd had with someone.

128
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,796
Sitting in a garden talking, a look.

129
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,634
I had those things with Emily. The
thought of losing that connection...

130
00:12:23,135 --> 00:12:24,428
Excuse me.

131
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,654
Yeah?

132
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:44,240
I'll be right there.

133
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,662
When Emily was
diagnosed with cancer,

134
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:53,666
the doctors predicted
that she had six months.

135
00:12:53,749 --> 00:12:58,129
That was three years ago.
And in a way we're lucky...

136
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:03,467
Rule.

137
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:06,303
Dear.

138
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:09,849
We still need the consonant CH,
Sydney, as in "choose".

139
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:11,600
I have this meeting.

140
00:13:11,684 --> 00:13:15,521
Did you and Emily ever think
about having children?

141
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:20,734
What we do here
is more than a career.

142
00:13:20,818 --> 00:13:24,071
I didn't think it was fair
to bring someone into the world

143
00:13:24,155 --> 00:13:26,365
who couldn't know their father.

144
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:29,618
Seeing the kind of woman
you've become,

145
00:13:29,702 --> 00:13:33,456
knowing that I had something
to do with it,

146
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:36,208
it's as rewarding
as if I had a child of my own.

147
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:37,543
That's it.

148
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:39,587
Choose.

149
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,258
You have exactly 57 minutes
before the passwords change.

150
00:14:05,488 --> 00:14:07,990
You had a cavity.

151
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:13,871
Talk to me about the Circumference.

152
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:18,209
I don't know a thing
about the Circumference.

153
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,545
I swear to God.

154
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,217
Please...

155
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,806
No...

156
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:45,861
As you know, the Alliance granted
your request to spare your wife.

157
00:14:45,945 --> 00:14:50,074
Your argument was that she was
suffering from a terminal illness.

158
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:52,660
But that is no longer the case.

159
00:14:57,748 --> 00:15:00,084
I propose we bring Emily in.

160
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,546
Emily spent eight years
in the State Department.

161
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:08,676
She was a senior partner at Rako.
Emily will be an asset here.

162
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,513
If I were in your position,
I might try to do the same,

163
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:14,974
but it won't work.

164
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:19,395
I am truly sorry, but these are
the prescripts of the Alliance.

165
00:15:19,478 --> 00:15:22,189
You don't know the kind of mistake
you are making.

166
00:15:22,273 --> 00:15:25,484
As I said before,
threats will do no good.

167
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:27,736
This threat might.

168
00:15:29,405 --> 00:15:33,325
It's not what I'll do if you have
Emily killed. It's what I won't do.

169
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:38,789
The Alliance is falling apart.
This organisation is crumbling

170
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:44,170
under the weight of corruption,
bureaucracy, infighting, fear.

171
00:15:44,253 --> 00:15:47,381
With enemies like Khasinau,
we live in a new world.

172
00:15:47,465 --> 00:15:53,012
You think the Alliance is going to
survive under its current state?

173
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:58,058
We need new leadership.

174
00:15:58,142 --> 00:16:00,978
With Briault and Poole gone,

175
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:05,024
there are two empty chairs
around the partners' table.

176
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:09,779
- And you want one of them?
- I demand one of them.

177
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:16,911
Arvin, I came here today not only
to hear your appeal for your wife

178
00:16:16,994 --> 00:16:20,748
but because
the Alliance has already voted.

179
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:23,417
The agreement was unanimous.

180
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:27,671
We acknowledge that you should
be admitted as full partner.

181
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:33,219
Good.

182
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:40,601
However, this offer is contingent
on your fulfilling the other matter.

183
00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:52,214
I'm confused. Why am I here?

184
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:56,343
Mr Weiss said you were suspicious
abut Sydney Bristow.

185
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:24,205
When I said I was suspicious,
I meant Sydney seemed troubled.

186
00:18:24,288 --> 00:18:26,957
But that isn't
the word you used, is it?

187
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,266
Rule.

188
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:46,727
Dear.

189
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:49,814
Choose.

190
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:23,806
What I said was I feel I have
an understanding of Sydney Bristow,

191
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:27,560
and that she doesn't accept problems,
she tries to fix them.

192
00:19:27,643 --> 00:19:31,772
And that perhaps she and her father
were trying to free Mr Tippin alone?

193
00:19:31,856 --> 00:19:34,191
It was just a conversation.

194
00:19:34,275 --> 00:19:38,904
Do you think Miss Bristow is hiding
something from you, from the CIA?

195
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:48,581
Yes, sir.

196
00:19:57,548 --> 00:20:00,551
Records say Jack Bristow
checked into your location.

197
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:03,471
- 20 minutes ago.
- Keep him there.

198
00:20:03,554 --> 00:20:05,639
Sir, he already left.

199
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:19,069
In Aconcagua when I was shot,
you radioed for help.

200
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:23,073
You used the call sign Freelancer.

201
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:26,952
Sydney, your SD-6 call sign
was Bluebird.

202
00:20:29,538 --> 00:20:32,541
I want to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

203
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,336
I even made excuses for you
in my head.

204
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:39,757
Trouble is, I don't believe
any of those excuses.

205
00:20:44,637 --> 00:20:49,266
Who are you working for?
And do not play games with me.

206
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:53,354
Dixon, you know I'd never
do anything to hurt you.

207
00:20:53,437 --> 00:20:56,148
I'd never do anything
to betray what we believe in.

208
00:20:56,232 --> 00:21:00,361
How can I know what you believe
when you've been lying to me?

209
00:21:00,444 --> 00:21:02,530
I'm your partner!

210
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:08,077
Just think about this for a minute.
Think about what we've been through.

211
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,871
Just think about who I am.

212
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:14,917
What I am gonna ask you to do

213
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,755
is just accept the fact that I cannot
tell you what this is about.

214
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:25,136
What I am doing is classified.

215
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:35,104
Dixon, I swear to you that
I am not betraying this country.

216
00:21:36,021 --> 00:21:39,150
I could never do that. You know that.

217
00:21:43,112 --> 00:21:45,990
I don't need rhetoric, Sydney.

218
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:53,497
Right now I need a reason not to
report you to security section.

219
00:21:58,294 --> 00:21:59,837
- Yeah?
- It's me.

220
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,423
Jack? What the hell are you doing?

221
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:05,176
- Saving a life.
- And destroying another.

222
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:08,179
You stole classified property
of the US government.

223
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:11,640
You'll get the solution back,
plus a copy of the Rambaldi page.

224
00:22:11,724 --> 00:22:15,603
I've accepted your methods for years,
but there's a mole hunt going on.

225
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:19,857
- Any leads on the mole?
- So far, I'm talking to the guy.

226
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,612
I gave Haladki authority to start
an inquiry. He's got questions.

227
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:27,364
Why you were willing
to risk Tippin's life,

228
00:22:27,448 --> 00:22:29,742
how you know
about the Circumference.

229
00:22:29,825 --> 00:22:32,787
This doesn't look good.
Come back to the office.

230
00:22:34,663 --> 00:22:37,792
- We're friends, you and I.
- What?

231
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,461
You'd consider us friends?

232
00:22:40,544 --> 00:22:43,631
I used to.
What the hell are you talking about?

233
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,051
See you when the job's done.

234
00:22:55,476 --> 00:22:59,605
A gentleman I know
makes this truth serum.

235
00:22:59,688 --> 00:23:03,150
I would have used it earlier,
except that...

236
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:08,781
one in five men who receives it
has an unfortunate reaction.

237
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:15,996
It results in paralysis.

238
00:23:17,373 --> 00:23:19,834
Among other things.

239
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:56,412
Tell me about the Circumference.

240
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:07,923
It's been six days.

241
00:24:08,716 --> 00:24:11,343
Will warned me
something might happen.

242
00:24:11,427 --> 00:24:14,472
He didn't even turn up
to his own awards dinner.

243
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:18,100
I called his friends.
They haven't heard from him either.

244
00:24:21,854 --> 00:24:24,356
Are you going to publish his story?

245
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,151
Yeah. In the A section.

246
00:24:27,985 --> 00:24:33,324
I have to tell Dietrich. Call Orci
in Graphics. Get a photo of Will.

247
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:41,749
Dixon just turned and walked away.
I think he's gonna report me.

248
00:24:41,832 --> 00:24:46,504
If we have to deal with that crisis,
we'll deal with that crisis.

249
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,347
My God.

250
00:24:58,224 --> 00:25:01,560
This device,
I took it from Taipei last year.

251
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:05,397
Two weeks ago
a report came in through CIA

252
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:09,902
claiming Khasinau's been looking for
something called the Circumference.

253
00:25:09,985 --> 00:25:13,572
Instructions describing a method
of applying a technology he'd got.

254
00:25:13,656 --> 00:25:16,617
This must be the Circumference.

255
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,286
So if Khasinau built
one of these devices,

256
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,081
this page would tell him
how to use it.

257
00:25:25,751 --> 00:25:28,504
- Keep this safe.
- Dad, what are you doing?

258
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:33,968
- We have to be in Taipei.
- I'll call when the plane's ready.

259
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:36,554
Don't go home.

260
00:25:55,823 --> 00:25:58,033
How do you know
about the Circumference?

261
00:25:58,117 --> 00:26:01,036
You are out of your mind.

262
00:26:15,092 --> 00:26:19,180
Dammit, my eyes! God!

263
00:26:19,263 --> 00:26:21,515
How long have you
worked for Khasinau?

264
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:23,476
You sick son of a bitch!

265
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:27,021
Devlin said you mentioned
the Circumference.

266
00:26:27,104 --> 00:26:30,024
You must have learned about it
from the outside.

267
00:26:33,402 --> 00:26:35,488
Do you work for Khasinau?

268
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:36,906
No.

269
00:26:38,157 --> 00:26:41,285
- Do you work for Khasinau?
- You son of a bitch...

270
00:26:45,498 --> 00:26:48,584
Yes! I work for Khasinau.

271
00:26:49,668 --> 00:26:51,670
- How long?
- Two years.

272
00:26:51,754 --> 00:26:53,881
Why does he want
the Circumference?

273
00:26:53,964 --> 00:26:56,926
It's the key
to something he's had built.

274
00:26:57,009 --> 00:27:01,055
- Tell me about it.
- All I know is it's just a battery.

275
00:27:01,138 --> 00:27:04,225
- For what?
- I swear I don't know.

276
00:27:04,308 --> 00:27:06,393
Jack, Khasinau's the future.

277
00:27:06,477 --> 00:27:09,605
- Where is this thing, this battery?
- It's in Taipei.

278
00:27:09,688 --> 00:27:12,691
The Fu Hsing district.
In a warehouse.

279
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:16,904
Peng Pharmaceuticals.
In an underground lab. Room 47.

280
00:27:16,987 --> 00:27:20,032
You gave Khasinau
the information about the safehouse.

281
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:24,036
Jack, this is a gift I'm giving you.

282
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,664
Khasinau can save you.
You should be with him.

283
00:27:26,747 --> 00:27:30,709
You told him that my daughter
is a double agent with SD-6.

284
00:27:30,793 --> 00:27:32,753
Jack! Look at yourself.

285
00:27:32,837 --> 00:27:35,589
You exposed Sydney.

286
00:27:35,673 --> 00:27:38,968
Come with me. I can save you.

287
00:27:40,052 --> 00:27:42,138
I can save you.

288
00:28:01,449 --> 00:28:03,534
Hi.

289
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,706
Hi.

290
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:13,878
How did you find me?

291
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:16,922
You told me a couple of months ago

292
00:28:17,006 --> 00:28:20,760
that when you need to disappear
you go to the observatory.

293
00:28:20,843 --> 00:28:23,804
But the observatory was closed.

294
00:28:23,888 --> 00:28:28,225
Then I remembered you said the pier
calmed you down. You weren't there.

295
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:30,436
You weren't at the bluffs either.

296
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:34,398
- You didn't go to all those places?
- I did.

297
00:28:34,482 --> 00:28:37,818
And then I remembered
you liked the train station too.

298
00:28:38,903 --> 00:28:41,781
Normal people
go to their normal jobs.

299
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:47,745
I can't believe you remember that.

300
00:28:49,872 --> 00:28:53,292
He's contacted you, hasn't he?
Khasinau?

301
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:58,297
And he wants the page.

302
00:29:01,092 --> 00:29:03,803
You're gonna give it to him.

303
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:08,390
You came here to stop me.

304
00:29:14,939 --> 00:29:17,858
My father used to keep a diary.

305
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:22,279
When I was a kid, I used to say,
"Dad, only girls keep diaries."

306
00:29:22,363 --> 00:29:24,698
And he'd just laugh.

307
00:29:25,574 --> 00:29:28,410
He was a really good guy, my dad.

308
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:37,545
But he was too hard on himself.

309
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:40,506
He was such a company guy.

310
00:29:40,589 --> 00:29:45,803
Whenever he slipped up, even in the
slightest way, he took it personally.

311
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:51,392
There were a few operations...

312
00:29:53,978 --> 00:29:57,106
...his last one among them,

313
00:29:57,189 --> 00:29:59,650
that he questioned.

314
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:06,699
Operations he refused to participate
in... but only in his diary.

315
00:30:07,992 --> 00:30:13,164
He'd write out what he wanted to say
to the CIA director,

316
00:30:13,998 --> 00:30:17,126
things he could
never say in real life.

317
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:24,884
He was a company man
and I loved him very much.

318
00:30:27,178 --> 00:30:29,263
But it killed him.

319
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:33,267
Never questioning orders,

320
00:30:34,143 --> 00:30:37,271
his blind devotion to the job.

321
00:30:40,858 --> 00:30:43,903
If you're doing
what I think you're doing,

322
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,448
I'm in.

323
00:30:47,531 --> 00:30:49,617
If you need me.

324
00:30:56,874 --> 00:30:58,959
Thank you.

325
00:31:12,264 --> 00:31:15,518
- Who told you about this?
- I found a source.

326
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:19,438
Khasinau's already built one of these
and it's in this warehouse.

327
00:31:19,522 --> 00:31:22,024
An underground lab, room 47.

328
00:31:22,108 --> 00:31:25,152
The meeting with Sark takes place
two hours from now.

329
00:31:25,236 --> 00:31:27,988
By the time I hand over the page,

330
00:31:28,072 --> 00:31:31,742
you must have destroyed not only
the device but the lab itself.

331
00:31:31,826 --> 00:31:35,496
The device'll be easy. It's the size
of a shoe. What about the lab?

332
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:38,707
Here. It's a red mercury charge
with a mechanical fuse.

333
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:42,670
I'll see what they need.

334
00:31:46,132 --> 00:31:50,177
I understand the risks you've taken,
and you have my respect for that.

335
00:31:55,224 --> 00:31:59,061
If he knew anything about the
Circumference, we'd have heard it.

336
00:31:59,145 --> 00:32:03,315
I suspected as much.
Prepare Mr Tippin for the exchange.

337
00:32:36,015 --> 00:32:38,309
One in five, you little bitch!

338
00:32:39,101 --> 00:32:41,187
One in five!

339
00:33:27,691 --> 00:33:29,276
Arvin...

340
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:34,949
I can't judge you for what you do.

341
00:33:35,032 --> 00:33:40,287
I was never there. I was never faced
with the choices you had to make.

342
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:42,581
And I have never...

343
00:33:48,295 --> 00:33:53,384
What I'm trying to say is...
I forgive you.

344
00:35:58,092 --> 00:36:02,138
Jack Bristow...
doing his daughter's work.

345
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,391
There was speculation
that you might appear.

346
00:36:05,474 --> 00:36:09,520
If you're not comfortable, we can
waive our business for tonight.

347
00:36:09,603 --> 00:36:14,733
Are you comfortable trading priceless
documents for a low-grade reporter?

348
00:36:14,817 --> 00:36:17,153
Tippin's stuff is not so bad.

349
00:36:17,236 --> 00:36:20,156
- Let's see the artefacts.
- Let's see Tippin.

350
00:36:37,631 --> 00:36:39,717
Shall we?

351
00:36:41,051 --> 00:36:44,346
- You've exposed the page.
- You would have done the same.

352
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:49,977
When I activate this, you have
ten seconds to cross the hall.

353
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,813
I'll go radio-silent
until I'm in the lab.

354
00:36:52,897 --> 00:36:57,485
Parchment fibres are consistent
with the original Rambaldi document.

355
00:36:57,568 --> 00:36:59,945
Yes. We have a deal.

356
00:37:03,324 --> 00:37:07,244
Tell your daughter how much
I enjoyed the stage show in Paris.

357
00:37:07,328 --> 00:37:10,039
She has a marvellous singing voice.

358
00:37:48,327 --> 00:37:50,412
Thank you.

359
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:57,545
Thank you.

360
00:39:28,636 --> 00:39:32,807
Vaughn, it's bigger than I thought.

361
00:39:38,604 --> 00:39:40,773
Syd, I can't hear you.

362
00:39:43,734 --> 00:39:46,487
I turn this thing off,
I'm gonna have to swim out.

363
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:49,740
You're breaking up.
Syd, I'm coming down.

364
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,771
You're Alexander Khasinau.

365
00:43:09,982 --> 00:43:12,067
You should eat something.

366
00:43:15,446 --> 00:43:17,531
I'm not hungry.

367
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,585
Wait.

368
00:43:31,128 --> 00:43:33,756
I have questions for you.

369
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,967
- You can ask my boss.
- Your boss?

370
00:43:38,594 --> 00:43:41,597
I thought The Man was the boss.

371
00:43:42,306 --> 00:43:44,391
Yes.

372
00:43:45,142 --> 00:43:47,228
Yes, but I'm not The Man.

373
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:12,294
I have waited
almost 30 years for this.

374
00:44:18,384 --> 00:44:20,469
Mom?
